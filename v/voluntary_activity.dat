2500|$|These men {{strongly}} influenced Cousin's philosophical thought. To Laromiguière he attributes {{the lesson of}} decomposing thought, even though the reduction of it to sensation was inadequate. Royer-Collard taught him that even sensation is subject to certain internal laws and principles which it does not itself explain, which are superior to analysis and the natural patrimony of the mind. De Biran made a special study of the phenomena of the will. He taught him to distinguish in all cognitions, {{and especially in the}} simplest facts of consciousness, the <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> in which our personality is truly revealed.

2500|$|The Culture is a {{symbiotic}} society of artificial intelligences (AIs) (Minds and drones), humanoids and other alien species who all share equal status. All essential work is performed (as far as possible) by non-sentient devices, freeing sentients to do {{only things that}} they enjoy (administrative work requiring sentience is undertaken by the AIs using a bare fraction of their mental power, or by people who take on the work out of free choice). As such, the Culture is a post-scarcity society, where technological advances ensure that no one lacks any material goods or services. As a consequence, the Culture has no need of economic constructs such as money (as is apparent when it deals with civilizations in which money is still important). [...] The Culture rejects all forms of economics based on anything other than <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity.</b> [...] "Money implies poverty" [...] is a common saying in the Culture.|$|E

60|$|If we look {{a little}} closer, we can define this {{positive}} and negative business better. As a matter of fact, positive and negative, passive and active cuts both ways. If the man, as thinker and doer, is active, or positive, and the woman negative, then, on the other hand, as the initiator of emotion, of feeling, and of sympathetic understanding the woman is positive, the man negative. The man may be the initiator in action, but the woman is initiator in emotion. The man has the initiative as far as <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> goes, and the woman the initiative as far as sympathetic activity goes.

60|$|Let us {{come now}} to the {{consideration}} of the words Fancy and Imagination, as employed in the classification of the following Poems. 'A man,' says an intelligent author, 'has imagination in proportion as he can distinctly copy in idea the impressions of sense: it is the faculty which images within the mind the phenomena of sensation. A man has fancy in proportion as he can call up, connect, or associate, at pleasure, those internal images ([Greek: phantazein] is to cause to appear) so as to complete ideal representations of absent objects. Imagination {{is the power of}} depicting, and fancy of evoking and combining. The imagination is formed by patient observation; the fancy by a <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> in shifting the scenery of the mind. The more accurate the imagination, the more safely may a painter, or a poet, undertake a delineation, or a description, without the presence of the objects to be characterised. The more versatile the fancy, the more original and striking will be the decorations produced.'--British Synonyms discriminated, by W. Taylor.|$|E
60|$|The {{primitive}} tendency or instinct {{of mankind}} is to assimilate all the agencies which they perceive in Nature, {{to the only}} one of which they are directly conscious, their own <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity.</b> Every object which seems to originate power, that is, to act without being first visibly acted upon, to communicate motion without having first received it, they suppose to possess life, consciousness, will. This first rude conception of nature can scarcely, however, have been at any time extended to all phaenomena. The simplest observation, without which the preservation of life would have been impossible, must have pointed out many uniformities in nature, many objects which, under given circumstances, acted exactly like one another: and whenever this was observed, men's natural and untutored faculties led them to form the similar objects into a class, and to think of them together: of which it was a natural consequence to refer effects, which were exactly alike, to a single will, rather than to a number of wills precisely accordant. But this single will could not be the will of the objects themselves, since they were many: it must be the will of an invisible being, apart from the objects, and ruling them from an unknown distance. This is Polytheism. We are not aware that in any tribe of savages or negroes who have been observed, Fetichism has been found totally unmixed with Polytheism, and it is probable that the two coexisted from the earliest period at which the human mind was capable of forming objects into classes. Fetichism proper gradually becomes limited to objects possessing a marked individuality. A particular mountain or river is worshipped bodily (as it is even now by the Hindoos and the South Sea Islanders) as a divinity in itself, not the mere residence of one, long after invisible gods have been imagined as rulers of all the great classes of phaenomena, even intellectual and moral, as war, love, wisdom, beauty, &c. The worship of the earth (Tellus or Pales) and of the various heavenly bodies, was prolonged into the heart of Polytheism. Every scholar knows, though littérateurs and men of the world do not, that in the full vigour of the Greek religion, the Sun and Moon, not a god and goddess thereof, were sacrificed to as deities--older deities than Zeus and his descendants, belonging to the earlier dynasty of the Titans (which was the mythical version of the fact that their worship was older), and these deities had a distinct set of fables or legends connected with them. The father of Phaëthon and the lover of Endymion were not Apollo and Diana, whose identification with the Sungod and the Moongoddess was a late invention. Astrolatry, which, as M. Comte observes, is the last form of Fetichism, survived the other forms, partly because its objects, being inaccessible, were not so soon discovered to be in themselves inanimate, and partly because of the persistent spontaneousness of their apparent motions.|$|E

40|$|This {{article will}} deal with the {{correlation}} between <b>voluntary</b> <b>activities</b> and religion in terms of altruism. In the United Kingdom there are over five-hundred thousand voluntary organizations, and among them about 170, 000 are registered charities. The charitable purposes of these organizations are altruistic and classified under four headings : the relief of poverty, the advancement of education, the advancement of religion, and other purposes beneficial to the community. Although it received only indirect mention in the preamble of the Statute of Elizabeth I (the Charitable Uses Act 1601),the advancement of religion has always been considered a charitable object. Indeed, {{the very concept of}} charity is essentially religious in origin. Thus, charitable activities and religions have traditionally been strongly related. After surveying the literature on altruism, we shall consider the social dimension of these <b>voluntary</b> <b>activities</b> and their significance.
