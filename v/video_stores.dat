5|$|As a {{promotion}} for the film, Warner Bros. Entertainment released , {{a series of}} narrated animations of the original comic book. The first chapter was released for purchase {{in the summer of}} 2008 on digital <b>video</b> <b>stores,</b> such as iTunes Store and Amazon Video on Demand. DC Direct released action figures based on the film in January 2009. Director Zack Snyder also set up a YouTube contest petitioning Watchmen fans to create faux commercials of products made by the fictional Veidt Enterprises. The producers also released two short video pieces online, which were intended to be viral videos designed as fictional backstory pieces, with one being a 1970 newscast marking the 10th anniversary of the public appearance of Dr. Manhattan. The other was a short propaganda film promoting the Keene Act of 1977, which made it illegal to be a superhero without government support. An official viral marketing web site, The New Frontiersman, is named after the tabloid magazine featured in the graphic novel, and contains teasers styled as declassified documents. After the trailer to the film premiered in July 2008, DC Comics president Paul Levitz said that the company had had to print more than 900,000 copies of Watchmen trade collection to meet the additional demand for the book that the advertising campaign had generated, with the total annual print run expected to be over one million copies. DC Comics reissued Watchmen #1 for the original cover price of $1.50 on December 10, 2008; no other issues are to be reprinted.|$|E

Two days after the events of [...] "A Good Man Goes to War", Vastra and Jenny convince Strax {{that he is not}} mortally wounded and invite him to accompany them back to 1800s London.

500|$|The Tales of the Black Freighter DVD also {{includes}} Under the Hood, a fictional in-universe documentary detailing the characters' backstories, which takes its title {{from that of}} Hollis Mason's memoirs in the comic book. Under the Hood is rated PG because {{it is meant to}} resemble a behind-the-scenes television news magazine profile of the characters. The actors were allowed to improvise during filming interviews in character. Bolex cameras were even used to film [...] "archive" [...] footage of the Minutemen. The film itself was scheduled to be released on DVD four months after Tales of the Black Freighter, and Warner released a director's cut on July 21, 2009, and the extended version with the animated film edited back into the main picture was scheduled to be released on November 3, 2009, but did not hit the shelves until November 10, 2009. Snyder said if the film did well enough, a theatrical release of the director's cut would be shown at theaters in New York and Los Angeles simultaneously [...] In addition, the , was released in digital <b>video</b> <b>stores</b> and DVD on March 3. It included an exclusive scene from the movie but as of press time (prior to the disc's release) the scene had yet to be added.|$|E
500|$|Tenebrae {{has been}} {{released}} on home media in many different versions in numerous territories. In 1983, when the VHS edition was released in the United Kingdom, it was short by about four seconds. However, the film soon found itself included in a list of thirty-nine so-called [...] "video nasties" [...] that were successfully prosecuted and banned from sale in UK <b>video</b> <b>stores</b> under the Video Recordings Act 1984. Deemed harmful to audiences, [...] "video nasties" [...] were strongly criticized for their violent content by the press, social commentators and various religious organizations. Speculating in 2011, Thomas Rostock said that the higher-than-usual murder count for an Argento film was partially responsible, while James Gracey believed it was perhaps [...] "the highly sexualized presentation of its violent content". He went on to say, [...] "Of all the titles placed on the video nasty list, Tenebrae {{is perhaps the most}} misunderstood and undeserving of the grimy status it gained through its association with the whole debacle." [...] Kim Newman agreed that Tenebraes reputation as a [...] "video nasty" [...] was unwarranted, saying that none of the on-screen deaths are as gory or lingering as those in Argento's previous films. He also believed Tenebrae would eventually be remembered on its own merits, rather than as part of the [...] "video nasties" [...] list. Nevertheless, the ban lasted until 1999, when Tenebrae was legally released on videotape with one second of footage removed in addition to the previously censored five. In 2003, the BBFC reclassified the film and passed it without any cuts. In Germany, the release was strongly cut, and reportedly seized by the authorities.|$|E
