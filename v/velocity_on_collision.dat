40|$|We {{study how}} {{different}} relative orientations and impact <b>velocity</b> <b>on</b> the <b>collision</b> of two silver nanoparticles affect the first {{stages of the}} formation of a new, larger nanoparticle. In order to do this, we implemented a set of molecular dynamics simulations on the NVE ensemble on pairs of silver icosahedral nanoparticles at several relative orientations, that allowed us to follow the dynamics of the first nanoseconds of the coalescence processes. Using bond angle analysis, we found that the initial relative orientation of the twin planes has a critical role on the final stability of the resulting particle, and on the details of the dynamics itself. When the original particles have their closest twins aligned to each other, the formed nanoparticle will likely stabilize its structure onto a particle with a defined center and a low surface-to-volume ratio, while nanoparticles with misaligned twins will promote the formation of highly defective particles with a high inner energy...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} {{following}} question: {{how do we}} know a proposed design for an Automated Vehicle/Highway System (AVHS) is safe? In particular, can we prove {{that there can be no}} high relative <b>velocity</b> <b>collision</b> <b>on</b> the AVHS? We show that if the controllers in the vehicles satisfy a set of constraints, then the AVHS is safe. The problem of checking whether the controllers satisfy the constraints is equivalent to solving an optimal control problem. Keywords: Automated Vehicle/Highway System 1 Introduction Automation of driving functions is central to proposals for the design of an Automated Vehicle/Highway System (AVHS). In the control architecture in [Var 93], it is proposed that vehicles travel in platoons. Three maneuvers are needed: in merge, two platoons join together; in split, one platoon separates into two; and in change lane, a single vehicle changes lane. Using these maneuvers, a vehicle enters the system, becomes part of a platoon, travels to its destination, detaches itself from th [...] ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{comparisons between}} molecular dynamics simulations (MDSs) and the Keilson and Storer (KS) model for collision-induced translational velocity changes in pure H- 2 {{at room temperature}} from four different points of view. The first considers various autocorrelation functions associated with the velocity. The second and third comparisons are made for the collision kernels and for the time evolutions of some conditional probabilities {{for changes in the}} velocity modulus and orientation. Finally, the evolutions, with density, of the half widths of the Q(1) lines of the isotropic Raman (1 - 0) fundamental band and of the (2 - 0) overtone quadrupole band are investigated. The results demonstrate that, while the KS approach gives a poor description of detailed velocity-to-velocity changes, it leads to accurate results for the correlation functions and spectral shapes, quantities resulting from large averages over the <b>velocity.</b> <b>On</b> the opposite, <b>collision</b> kernels derived from MDS lead to accurate predictions of all considered quantities. The results open promising perspectives for modeling of the spectral shapes of other systems. They also stress the value of direct calculations of speed-dependent broadening and shifting parameters from the intermolecular potential to avoid their determination from measured spectra and permit fully meaningful tests of the models...|$|R
40|$|Collisions {{of small}} and heavy non-spherical {{particles}} settling in turbulence are very important for systems such as ice clouds and proto-planetary disks where the particle spectra evolution is strongly dependent <b>on</b> the <b>collision</b> induced growth rate. Still, {{the influence of the}} particle shape <b>on</b> the <b>collision</b> probability is virtually unknown. Building on our recent investigation <b>on</b> the <b>collision</b> rate of monodisperse suspensions of ellipsoidal particles (Siewert et al., J. Fluid Mech. 758, 686 - 701, 2014), we show theoretically and by direct numerical simulations that the behavior of ellipsoids subject to turbulence and gravity is different from the behavior of spheres. Due to the dependence of the particle settling <b>velocity</b> <b>on</b> the particle orientation, the relative velocity at contact is influenced by turbulence. When ellipsoids differ either by mass or shape, their contact velocity is randomized by the randomized particle orientation. For particles much heavier than the fluid these orientation dependent settling velocity differences are larger than the relative velocities directly induced by the turbulent fluctuations...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{understand}} the fragmentation of small neutral carbon clusters formed by high <b>velocity</b> atomic <b>collision</b> <b>on</b> atomic gas. In this experiment, the mainway of deexcitation of neutral clusters formed by electron capture with ionicspecies is the fragmentation. To measure the channels of fragmentation, a new detection tool based on shape analysis of current pulse delivered by semiconductor detectors has been developped. For the first time, all branching ratios of neutral carbon clusters are measured in an unambiguous way for clusters size up to 10 atoms. The measurements have been compared to a statistical model in microcanonical ensemble. In this model various structural properties of carbon clusters are required. These datas have been calculated with density functional theory to find the geometries of the clusters and then with coupled clusters formalism to obtain dissociation energies and other quantities needed to compute fragmentation model which has allowed to find an energy distribution deposited in the collision. Finaly specific cluster effect has been found namely a large population of excited states. This behaviour is completely different of the atomic carbon case with the electron capture in the ground states predominates. AUCU...|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} (MD) simulation techniques with Lennard-Jones (LJ) and embedded-atom-method (EAM) potentials {{have been}} performed to study the behavior of nanometer diameter clusters. ^ The melting behavior and the solidified structures of single-component LJ and EAM Au clusters as well as two-component LJ and EAM Pd/Pt clusters were investigated. All the clusters show depressed melting temperatures compared with the bulk, which increase with increasing cluster size. The melting temperatures for Au clusters obtained using the EAM potential are higher than those measured experimentally. As clusters become bigger, their lowest energy structure transforms from icosahedral (IC) to face-centered-cubic (FCC). From solidification simulations, the critical size range for this transformation is between 13 and 55 atoms for EAM Au clusters, while for LJ clusters it is larger than 110 atoms. ^ For LJ clusters consisting of two components with different interaction strengths or atomic radii, superheating of the core atoms can be achieved if the core atoms are surrounded by stronger-interacting atoms. Upon solidification clusters {{tend to have a}} multi-layer icosahedral (MIC) structure, with the stronger-interacting atoms in the core. If the two components have different atomic radii, the solidified structures do not show significant order. In the EAM Pd/Pt case in which there were 13 Pt atoms and 42 Pd atoms, the solidified structure is MIC with a Pt core surrounded by Pd. ^ Head-on collisions between two LJ clusters and between two EAM Au clusters were investigated. For each system two types of simulations were performed: collisions in which the initial temperature of the clusters was 0 K and collisions in which the clusters had a finite initial temperature. All the collisions result in sticking, i. e., a single collision product. Quenched to 0 K, the products of LJ collisions display an IC symmetry, whereas the products of the EAM Au collisions do not show significant structural order. ^ The effects of initial impact parameter and initial relative <b>velocity</b> <b>on</b> the <b>collision</b> dynamics of two 55 -atom LJ clusters were also studied. Using a mean relative velocity, the critical impact parameter calculated assuming a spherically symmetric cluster-cluster potential is in good agreement with the simulation results. However the sticking probabilities at different impact parameters are smaller than the simulation values obtained for an initial cluster temperature, T* = 0. 1, due to the neglect of vibrational motion in the theory. ...|$|R
