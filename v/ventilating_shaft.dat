50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the Commissioner of Public Health, using the strong coercive powers {{given to him}} under the {{provisions}} of the Health Act of 1900, required the Brisbane Municipal Council to erect ventilators in city streets to remove foul and unhealthy smells from the drainage systems. In 1900, the Council called tenders for the construction and erection of a <b>ventilating</b> <b>shaft</b> at Thorn Street, Kangaroo Point. No trace remains of this vent, except for its design, which was in the Monier system of re-inforced concrete, and identical with that of the vents that have survived on Wickham Terrace and St Paul's Terrace.|$|E

50|$|This book is {{extensively}} illustrated {{and describes}} {{the tools and}} machinery associated with mining. Handtools and different sorts of buckets, wheelbarrows and trucks on wooded plankways are described. Packs for horses and sledges are used to carry loads above ground. Agricola then provides details of various kinds of machines for lifting weights. Some of these are man-powered and some powered by up to four horses or by waterwheels. Horizontal drive shafts along tunnels allow lifting in shafts not directly connected to the surface. If this is not possible treadmills will be installed underground. Instead of lifting weights similar machines use chains of buckets to lift water. Agricola also describes several designs of piston force pumps which are either man or animal powered or powered by waterwheels. Because these pumps can only lift water about 24 feet, batteries of pumps are required for the deepest mines. Water pipe designs are also covered in this section. Designs of wind scoop for <b>ventilating</b> <b>shafts</b> or forced air using fans or bellows are also described. Finally ladders and lifts using wicker cages are used to get miners up and down shafts.|$|R
5000|$|... "In Charles Street, {{at the top}} of Berners Street, {{the view}} down which it commands, is the Middlesex Hospital. The building, which is of brick, and very extensive, {{comprises}} a centre and wings; it is fitted up with baths, laboratory works, <b>ventilating</b> <b>shaft,</b> and, indeed, all the necessary appliances for comfort, &c. The hospital dates from about ten or twenty years after the splendid bequest of Thomas Guy, the penurious bookseller of Lombard Street. It was first established, in 1745, in Windmill Street, Tottenham Court Road, for sick and lame persons, and for lying-in married women. It was removed, in 1755, to its present site, when it stood among green fields and lanes. Since 1807 the midwifery patients, to the number of nearly a thousand yearly, instead of being received as inmates, are attended at their own homes by the medical officers of the hospital. The cancer wards were founded by a gift of £4,000 from Mr. Samuel Whitbread, in 1807, to which other gifts and legacies were added. A remarkable incident {{in the history of the}} hospital is that in 1793 it became a refuge for many of the French royalist emigrants driven from France by the Jacobin Reign of Terror. The buildings were enlarged by new wings constructed in 1775, and again in 1834. Lord Robert Seymour, a zealous and munificent friend of this institution, obtained for it the royal patronage of George IV., which is continued by her present Majesty. The medical school, established in 1835, enjoys a high reputation; it is furnished with a museum of valuable collections. The hospital contains beds for upwards of three hundred patients. Of these twenty-six are devoted to the cancer establishment, instituted in the year 1791, where the patient is allowed to remain [...] "until relieved by art or released by death;" [...] eight are appropriated to women suffering from diseases peculiar to their sex; the remainder of the beds being set apart for general miscellaneous cases. Upwards of nine hundred lying-in married women are attended at their own habitations, and eighteen thousand out-door patients are relieved every year. The hospital is unendowed. The annual subscriptions amount to not more than £2,355, while of late years the expenditure has been increased by some necessary works of improvement. This hospital has numbered among its surgeons and physicians men of the highest eminence in the medical profession; besides which it has been the cradle of many eminent careers in surgery." ...|$|E
50|$|Because {{of a lack}} of capital, {{the company}} was reconstituted in 1896 as the Brilliant Deep Levels Gold Mining Company. The shaft was then carried to 2,250 ft where the lode was intersected, but it was not payable. An {{explosion}} of dynamite of Christmas Day 1896 damaged the shaft collar throwing 30 men out of work. An underlie shaft had been driven to 2,615 ft but no payable ore was found and operations were suspended in 1904 due to difficulty in <b>ventilating</b> the <b>shafts.</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] Type A {{behaviour}} pattern, characterised by excessive competitiveness, impatience, {{hostility and}} time urgency, {{has been previously}} investigated as {{a risk factor for}} coronary heart disease. There are few studies concerning musculoskeletal symptoms and type A behaviour. Could there be a higher frequency of musculoskeletal symptoms with a more pronounced type A behaviour? DESIGN [...] A cross sectional retrospective study. Standardised nordic questionnaires were used for the analysis of musculoskeletal symptoms and the Bortner questionnaire and its subscales (1) speed and (2) hard driving and competitiveness were used to assess type A behaviour. SETTING [...] Factory based (a manufacturing industry where they make <b>ventilating</b> <b>shafts).</b> SUBJECTS [...] 58 blue collar workers (51 men and seven women). Mean age was 36. 9 years. Mean employment time was seven years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Blue collar workers with musculoskeletal symptoms had a more pronounced type A behaviour than those without symptoms. RESULTS [...] For shoulder symptoms during the past 12 months blue collar workers had a more pronounced type A behaviour (p < 0. 001). For symptoms during the past seven days the results were significant for the neck (p < 0. 01), the shoulder (p < 0. 01), and also for lower back pain (p < 0. 05). There were no differences in age, psychosocial factors, or psychosomatic symptoms. According to the Bortner subscales, the speed subscale seems to be more important than the hard driving and competitiveness subscales. CONCLUSIONS [...] Blue collar workers with a more pronounced type A behaviour seem to have a higher incidence of musculoskeletal symptoms...|$|R

50|$|The first type {{of mining}} {{utilizes}} shafts or sinkings, spaces that stretch, either vertically or sloping (from 90 to 60 degree of declivity), into the sandstone and crag rock, which {{is covered by}} a layer of argillaceous soil 6. These shafts lead directly to the ore and <b>ventilate</b> the underground <b>shafts</b> and facilitate the delivery of minerals and rocks to the surface.

6000|$|The Kilsby {{tunnel of}} the London and North west Railway {{is a case}} in point. When that tunnel was proposed, it was {{arranged}} that it should be about 3000 yards long, and 160 feet below the surface, with two great <b>ventilating</b> <b>shafts</b> 60 feet in diameter. It was a gigantic work. The engineer examined the ground in the usual way, with much care, and then advertised for [...] "tenders." [...] The various competing contractors also examined the ground minutely, and the offer of one of them to work it for 99,000 pounds was accepted. Forthwith the contractor went to work, and all went well and busily for some time, until it was suddenly discovered that a hidden quicksand extended 400 yards into the tunnel, which the trial shafts had just passed without touching. This was a more tremendous blow to the contractor than most readers may at first thought suppose, for he believed that to solidify a quicksand was impossible. The effect on him was so great that he was mentally prostrated, and although the company generously and justly relieved him from his engagement, the reprieve came too late, for he died. It then came to be a question whether or not the tunnel should be abandoned. Many advised that it should. At this juncture Mr Robert Stephenson, son of the great George, came forward and undertook the work. He placed his chief dependence on the steam-engine to keep the water down while the work was in progress. At first he was successful, but one day, while the men were busy laying their bricks in cement one of them drove into the roof, and a deluge of water burst in on them, and although they tried to continue their work on a raft the water prevailed and at last drove them out. They escaped with difficulty up one of the air-shafts. The water having put an effectual stop to the work, the directors felt disposed to give it up, but Stephenson begged for a fortnight more. It was granted. By means of thirteen steam-engines, the amazing quantity of 1800 gallons of water per minute was pumped out of the quicksand night and day for eight months. With the aid of 1250 men and 200 horses the work was finally completed, having occupied altogether thirty months from the laying of the first brick.|$|R
