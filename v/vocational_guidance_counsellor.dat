40|$|This {{article focuses}} {{attention}} {{on the problem of}} pupils who drop out of upper secondary school. One possible solution is to help pupils become better at choosing an educational path and subsequent career. As part of a continuing education study on <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance,</b> school <b>counsellors</b> and teachers worked to develop possible solutions to this problem based on R&D work done at their own places of employment. Data was gathered from such activities as pupil guidance conversations and exams/examination assignments. Theoretical concepts from Ellstrøm (2006) were used as analysis tools; adaptive learning and the ideal of pupilship in development. The article presents findings that indicate codetermination – not just involvement –  in the choice of activities, counsellors, education path and a pupil's choice of schools can influence a pupil’s ability to make appropriate career choices. The article provides practical examples of how schools can succeed with this, taking their point of departure in the school subject Educational Choices.

40|$|This {{exploratory}} {{case study}} investigated the role secondary school <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> believed they played in the course selection process, especially regarding the continuation of French {{as a second language}} (FSL). As new initiatives have been recently introduced to increase retention in all FSL programs throughout Ontario (OME, 2013 a), this study also sought to identify the factors <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> believed contributed to students continuing (or not continuing) the study of FSL past the mandatory Grade 9 credit. The following research questions guided this study: (1) How do <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> describe the process of course selection, with regards to FSL in particular?; (2) How do <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> view their role in the course selection process?; and (3) What do <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> identify as factors that contribute to students continuing (or not continuing) the study of FSL past Grade 9 ? Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> from 12 schools across one school board in Ontario. Analysis of the insights shared by <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> highlight the complexities of the course selection process, as well as the strategies and tools they each used to prepare students to make the most informed decisions regarding their course selection. When counselling students about continuing optional FSL courses after Grade 9, participants expressed that they would encourage the pursuit of FSL courses, if the topic was student initiated. Emerging evidence showed that core French and French immersion students were counselled differently, with the latter receiving more attention if they expressed a desire to leave the program. Finally, <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> identified a wide variety of reasons they believed affected retention and attrition rates at their schools, with the most common being for future employment purposes and not seeing the value in learning French...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Suicide is {{the primary}} cause of death of {{adolescents}} in Ireland. While much attention has been given this phenomenon, no research has specifically examined the role of <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> in secondary schools in Ireland in addressing this phenomenon. The purpose of this research was to examine the self-efficacy of <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> in Ireland for identifying and assessing students at risk for suicide, including four hypothesized predictors for such self-efficacy. These predictors were gender, institution of training, membership of the Irish Institute of Guidance and Counselling, and exposure to a suicidal student. The participants were 405 members of the Irish Institute of Guidance Counselling, a professional organization whose membership was inclusive of all <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> in secondary schools in Ireland. The instrument utilized was entitled Adolescent Suicide, and included fourteen questions measuring the three components of self-efficacy (i. e., efficacy expectations, outcome expectations and outcome values). The results were analyzed using measures of central tendency and logistic regression. Analyses using measures of central tendency indicated that Irish <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> as a whole had high global self-efficacy when it comes to intervening with suicide. Logistic regression analyses supported two of the four hypothesized predictors. In terms of the gender predictor variable, males were almost three times more likely than females to have high suicide intervention self-efficacy. In terms of the exposure to suicidal ideation variable, Irish <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> who were exposed to suicide in their work were more than {{three times more likely to}} have high suicide intervention self-efficacy than those <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> who had no such exposure. While the global suicide intervention self-efficacy score was high for the majority of Irish <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors,</b> individual item level analyses of the Adolescent Suicide instrument revealed areas of low suicide intervention self-efficacy in the efficacy expectation and outcome expectation components. In particular, Irish <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> questioned their ability to recognize a student at risk for suicide. The limitations of the present study were presented. Also, the research and professional practice implications of the findings of this study were discussed...|$|R
40|$|Guidance and {{counselling}} {{services have}} been an important feature of the New Zealand secondary education system for two decades now. However, {{there have been few}} official policy statements and little research on the subject, hence an adequate definition and prescription for the role of the <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellor</b> has not been produced. What type of work <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> do and how they perform their jobs has never been suitably examined in this country and it is something little known even to those who are actually involved in the service. What is known has been restricted to propositions provided by literature, which generally states what and how guidance counselling ought to be carried out, but rarely what is actually taking place. The actual role performance of <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> has been sought mostly by means of questionnaire survey studies. The present study made a day-to-day recording of the activities and the time allocated to the various activities of three practising <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> in three New Zealand secondary schools. The recording was carried out from June to August, 1979. Each counsellor was requested to make a detailed daily recording of all the activities undertaken and {{the amount of time spent}} on them. These records were then collected from the counsellors at the end of each week; the materials were collated and arranged into various categories and the amount of time for each was calculated. Comparisons were made among the three <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> in the activities undertaken and some comparison was also made with a comprehensive New Zealand questionnaire study. The overall results showed that the three <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> were involved in similar work patterns and about a third of their activities were in educational, <b>vocational,</b> and personal-social <b>guidance</b> areas which involved direct contacts with pupils whilst the remaining activities involved administrative duties, staff liaison, liaison with various supporting services, and a series of other minor responsibilities. Each counsellor, besides sharing the similar work patterns, was involved in some areas of activity which were unique from the other two. The counsellors had working weeks of lengthy duration which also included work done during the weekends. Although the period of the study was relatively short and involved only one part of the year, together with the fact that only three counsellors were studied, the results, nevertheless, provide a systematic and complete account of the actual role performances of these counsellors. In this way they provide a comprehensive account of what is actually being done by a selection of people in this important school position. The aims of this study were to achieve a better understanding of the role of <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellors</b> and to help overcome the vagueness usually associated with descriptions of the <b>guidance</b> <b>counsellor's</b> role...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1986 Perception and {{inquiries}} {{have revealed}} that not all <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers possess the necessary interviewing skills. The {{aim of the research}} was to identify generally applicable interviewing skills, as well as those specific interviewing skills which are characteristic of the <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> provided to a pupil leaving school. The aim was furthermore to determine to what extent <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers in Transvaal secondary schools are grounded in these skills. It has been indicated that <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> actually culminate in the interview. After the interview has been analysed from an educational perspective, attention has been given to the validity and reliability of the interview. Further attention has been given to the trainability in interviewing of <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers. The following most important, generally applicable interviewing skills were then identified. * Communication as interviewing skill - There is a distinction between verbal and non-verbal communication. * Listening as interviewing skill - A distinction is drawn between marginal listening, evaluative listening and projective listening. * Establishment of report as interviewing skill - A favourable emotional climate is a requirement for a successful interview. * "Silence" as interviewing skill - The following distinction applies: that between silence initiated by the interviewer, and silence initiated by the client. * Perception as interviewing skill - For the interviewer to correctly interpret that which he percepts is equally important, if not more important, than sensory perception. * Empathy as interviewing skill - It is essential for the interviewer to place himself in the position of the client without becoming emotionally involved. * Attitude as interviewing skill - Success will be determined by the interviewer's attitude towards the client. * Questioning as interviewing skill - There is a distinction between an openended and closed question. Questions should be put with utmost circumspection because it could influence the outcome of the interview. * The use of synopsis as interviewing skill - Through synopsis the client gets the opportunity to verify the information revealed to the interviewer. The specific interviewing skill characteristic to the <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> situation has been identified as: The skilful interpretation of reports. The <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teacher has a lot of information about the school leaver from the guardian's file, accumulative card and <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> file. The planning and application of an empirical research has been done. The research was mainly aimed at determining how important the <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers regard the interviewing skills and to what extent these teachers are grounded in interviewing skills. From the research it seemed that the training <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers received in interviewing, was inadequate. The most important conclusions were: * The importance of these interviewing skills to the interviewer can't be stressed enough. * The majority of <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers don't possess the basic qualifications to act as such. * Some <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers tend to underestimate the importance of the interviewing skills and they furthermore don't have the ability to handle• these interviewing skills adequately. The most important recommendations are: * That high priority be given to the training of interviewing skills to <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers. * That the Transvaal Education Department only appoint qualified <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers at secondary schools. * That attention should be given to the practical exercise of these skills. * That universities, in co-operation with the Transvaal Education Department present further courses in interviewing to acting <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers.
