However, after the failure of the Crusade of 1101, the Seljuq and Danishmend Turks resumed their offensive operations against the Byzantines. Following their defeats, the Seljuqs under Malik Shah had recovered control of central Anatolia, re-consolidating a <b>viable</b> <b>state</b> around the city of Iconium. Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, aged and suffering from an illness which proved to be terminal, was unable to prevent Turkish raids into the recovered areas of Byzantine Anatolia, though an attempt to take Nicaea in 1113 was thwarted by the Byzantines. In 1116 Alexios was able to personally take the field and was engaged in defensive operations in northwest Anatolia. [...] Basing his army at Lopadion, and later at Nicomedia, he succeeded in defeating raiding Turks in a minor battle at Poemanenon. After receiving reinforcements to his army Alexios decided to move onto the offensive.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a formal {{analysis of the}} recovery processes for a fishery, from undesired to desired levels of sustainable exploitation, using the theoretical framework of viability control. We define sustainability in terms of biological, economic and social constraints which need to be met for a viable fishery to exist. Biological constraints {{are based on the}} definition of a minimal resource stock to be preserved. Economic constraints relate to the existence of a minimum profit per vessel. Social constraints refer to the maintenance of a minimum size of the fleet, and to the maximum speed at which fleet adjustment can take place. Using fleet size and fishing effort per vessel as control variables, we identify the states of this bioeconomic system for which sustainable exploitation is possible, i. e. for which all constraints are dynamically met. Such favorable <b>states</b> are called <b>viable</b> <b>states.</b> We then examine possible transition phases, from non-viable to <b>viable</b> <b>states.</b> We characterize recovery paths, wih respect to the economic and social costs of limiting catches during the recovery period, and to the duration of this transition period. Sensitivity of each of the constraints to transition costs and time are analyzed. The analysis is applied to a single stock fishery; preliminary results of an empirical application to the bay of Biscay nephrops fishery are presented.

40|$|Research PaperIn this paper, {{we study}} {{recovering}} processes for fisheries facing crisis or over-exploitation of a marine renewable resource. We examine how to restore resource stocks and modify the economic {{characteristics of the}} fleet {{in order to put}} on a sustainable exploitation system, near of some maximal standard as the Maximum Sustainable Yield. We define the sustainability of the exploitation with respect to both economic and biological constraints. Biological constraints are bases on the definition of a minimal resource stock to be preserved in order to insure the resource regeneration. Economic constraints include a minimal size for the fleet (number of vessels, which induces a social constraint on the employment) and a minimal profit per boat. We use the viability framework to consider the favorable situations of the bio-economic system in which a sustainable exploitation is possible, i. e. <b>viable</b> <b>states</b> that make it possible to satisfy the co-viability conditions in the long run, taking into account dynamical properties of the system. Along with the definition of such favorable states, we examine transition phases to reach sustainable configurations from a crisis situation. We characterize the recovering paths studying the economic cost of limiting catches during recovery period, and the length of this transition period. The developed framework makes it possible to study the sensitivity of the various constraints on that cost and time, and to minimize either one or the other. To avoid recurrence of the over-exploitation problems, we characterize sustainable decisions associated with <b>viable</b> <b>states,</b> for the dynamical evolution of the system. It includes decisions on the effort allocated to each vessel, and decisions on the modification {{of the size of the}} fleet. We develop a global model for a single resource stock. As an illustration, we study the recovering of the Nephrops stocks in the Bay of Biscay, taking into account both conceptual and applied issues...|$|R

Viability sets and capture basin are a relatively new method to study complex dynamical systems, focusing on the preservation of some properties of the system (constraints in the state space) {{rather than on the}} possible stable states and equilibria. The viability set delimits the area of the state space where there is always a list of controls that allows the system to verify indefinitely the constraints. A viability set represents a huge amount of information about the system it studies. We propose here a geometric study of viability sets. This study is applied to the viability tube (the sequence of viability set over time) of a food process...|$|R

40|$|AbstractT-viable {{states in}} a closed set K under a certain set-valued dynamic are states from which there exists at least one {{solution}} remaining in K until a given time horizon T. Minimizing the cost to constraints lets us determine whether a given state is T-viable or not, and this is implementable in large dimension for the state-space. Minimizing on the initial condition itself lets find <b>viable</b> <b>states.</b> Quincampoix's semi-permeability property helps find other states located close to the viability boundary, which is then gradually delineated. The algorithm is particularly suited to the identification of specific trajectories, such as the heavy viable solution, or to the computation of viability kernels associated with delayed dynamics. The volume of the viability kernel and its confidence interval can be estimated by randomly drawing states and checking their viability status. Examples are given...|$|R
