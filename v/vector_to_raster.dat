40|$|The {{process of}} <b>vector</b> <b>to</b> <b>raster</b> {{conversion}} has information losses {{to a certain}} extent, and generates the error problems. The thesis discussed a few types of <b>vector</b> <b>to</b> <b>raster</b> conversion and some reasons of the errors, and systematically analyzed the progress that the error analysis methods have progressed in <b>vector</b> <b>to</b> <b>raster</b> conversion of areal feature, meanwhile analyzed the current existent key problems. The thesis put forward a new error analysis method, which made use of proportion component method to create structure raster data and carried on error analysis in <b>vector</b> <b>to</b> <b>raster</b> conversion of areal feature based structure raster data. Finally, the thesis took the <b>vector</b> <b>to</b> <b>raster</b> conversion of land-use data as an example carried on the verification research. The result discovered that the normal analysis method underrated the error of <b>vector</b> <b>to</b> <b>raster</b> conversion, because none full considered this reduce, simultaneity that increment problem that errors were not distributed equably on space in the <b>vector</b> <b>to</b> <b>raster</b> conversion. The thesis suggested that we might adopt structure raster data to improve the error analysis in <b>vector</b> <b>to</b> <b>raster</b> conversion. The method can distinguish errors from {{the cause of this}} reduce and the cause of that increment, and the error analysis is more overall, objective and accurate. In the meanwhile, we easily make visualization and create error map on the results of error analysis...|$|E

On the basis of analyzing the available algorithms, the method of automatic creation polygonous node based on triangle is proposed. Compared with the traditional algorithms, This method is easy and workable, high efficiency and confirmative, ensuring the creation of one by one relation between polygonous node and polygon without considering various special cases. For polygon interior of the complex polygon is off-center, the modified algorithm has some improvement, especially for convex polygons, the effect is obvious.

40|$|Problem statement: Great {{attention}} {{had been}} paid on spatial data quality by the scientific community. This {{was due to the}} negative impact that a poor spatial data quality had on the competitiveness of an organization. On other hand, we can never obtain good quality data from a poor quality data. In this study, we demonstrate the effects of the different processing and preprocessing on the quality of spatial data. As we know each type of processing introduces errors and deformations at the original spatial data. Approach: Field applications and real samples were presented to prove the effect of data processing on data quality. We used spectrally and spatially processed satellite images which present the following areas: (i) Greater Amman area, (ii) Walla and Habisse basins. Different types of processing using different scales and resolutions were applied to field applications to evaluate the effect of scale, resolution and electronic transfer from <b>vector</b> <b>to</b> <b>raster.</b> Results: The vector layers extracted from these spatial data at different scales and resolutions were compared to each other. The comparison showed a great deformation in shape and value. This research demonstrates the influence of the scale, the resolution and transformation from <b>vector</b> <b>to</b> <b>raster</b> of spatial data base on the accuracy. Conclusion: We concluded that scale, resolution and electronic transfer have great effects on data quality. This effect should be considered in building any data base and all data base must have history file for evaluating its accuracy quality...|$|E

40|$|The {{conversion}} of geographical entities between the raster and vector data structures introduces {{errors in the}} entities position. The <b>vector</b> <b>to</b> <b>raster</b> conversion results {{in a loss of}} information, since, when a Boolean classification of each pixel is used, the entities shape must follow the shape of the pixels. Thus, the information about the position of the entities in the vector data structure is lost with the conversion. This loss can be minimized if, instead of making a Boolean classification of the pixels, a fuzzy classification is performed, building Fuzzy Geographical Entities. These entities keep, for each pixel, the information about the pixel area that was inside the vector entities and therefore only the information about the position of the entities boundaries inside the pixels is lost. The Fuzzy Geographical Entities obtained through the previous conversion may be converted back to the vector data structure. An algorithm was developed to reconstruct the boundaries of the vector geographical entities using the information stored in the raster Fuzzy Geographical Entities. Since the grades of membership represent partial membership of the pixels to the entities, this information is valuable to reconstruct the entities boundaries in the vector data structure, generatin...|$|E
40|$|ResumenLas zonas agroecológicas del Coffea arabica son aquellas que presentan las condiciones y características del potencial biofísico favorables para su producción con óptimos rendimientos. El análisis de las condiciones geomorfológicas, del régimen hidrotérmico y de la cobertura edáfica en el municipio Atoyac de Álvarez, estado de Guerrero, México, y su representación cartográfica, mediante plataformas SIG, permitió identificar las áreas con potencialidades diferenciadas para el cultivo del Coffea arabica con vistas al establecimiento de su zonificación agroecológica. El enfoque sistémico y el procesamiento automatizado de la información propició la identificación de las áreas con potencial óptimo, medio, bajo y muy bajo. Los potenciales con una aptitud natural óptima se localizan en las zonas de montañas bajas, entre 1 100 a 1 500 msnm, con pendientes entre 1. 1 ° hasta 18 °, considerándose pendientes suaves y moderadas; con precipitaciones entre los 1 500 a 2 000 mm, en zonas semicálidas con espectro térmico de 18 °C a 22 °C y sobre suelos Acrisoles y con una clave jerarquizada Ah+Bh+Hh/ 2, con unidad primaria Acrisol. En el municipio la superficie de potenciales óptimos alcanza las 7 163. 47 ha; la de medio, las 28 143. 75 ha; la de bajo, las 62 130. 65 ha, y la de potencial muy bajo unas 58 411. 38 ha. Por su contenido, este enfoque y metodología pueden ser implementados en cualquier marco geográfico, adecuándose a las escalas cartográficas y evaluando las distintas apreciaciones agroecológicas, como aportación a las políticas y decisiones gubernamentales o empresariales para la planeación y el fomento de las áreas cafetaleras. AbstractCosta Grande, {{the largest}} coffee-producing {{region in the}} state of Guerrero, is where the lowest yields are {{obtained}} at the state level: An average 249 kg per ha, according to Sagarpa et al. (2011). This may be due not only to the low plant density in the area (approximately 1 274 plants per hectare), but also to the lack of chemical fertilization. It is estimated that chemical fertilizers are applied to only 0. 2 % of the coffee plants, and only 3 % of them benefit from the manure added to the soil. With the aim to establish agro-ecological areas for Coffea arabica (i. e., those with the most favorable agricultural conditions and the highest biophysical potential for optimum yields) a territorial survey was carried out in the municipality of Atoyac de Álvarez, Guerrero analyzing geomorphological, hydrothermal and edaphic maps based on gis platforms. Six map sheets at a scale of 1 : 50 000 (inegi, 2009) were employed so as to cover the entire area of study. On these maps the altitude, inclination, climate (temperature, rainfall) and soil types that were compatible with the agronomic requirements of Coffea Arabica were identified and marked out. Rainfall, temperature and soil type data were obtained from maps at a scale of 1 : 250 000 (inegi, 2009) transformed from <b>vector</b> <b>to</b> <b>raster</b> formats so as to facilitate automated processing. For the morphometric evaluation of the relief, a digital elevation model was built with measurements at each 20 m so as to obtain an hypsometric gradient of 100 m and the classification of inclination into four classes: 0. 1 ° to 18 ° (32 %), 18. 1 ° to 25 ° (33 - 47 %), 25. 1 ° to 40 ° (48 - 84 %), and over 40 ° (> 84 %). Central to the agro-ecological zoning of coffee is the concept of agro-ecological potential, as the set of quantitative and qualitative requirements on the natural environment conducive to the proper development of the coffee plant. The relationships between the different variables and the determination of their potentials, as well as the physical-geographical zoning of Coffea Arabica, depended on the reclassification of selected variables and their spatial analysis based on GIS using the software ILWIS 3. 31 with a view to obtaining an integrated natural potential model. Agro-ecological areas with optimal, medium, low and very low potentials for the production of this variety of coffee were defined. Optimal areas are located at moderate-to-weak mountain slopes (1. 1 ° to 18 °) with Acrisols (hierarchical key Ah+Bh+Hh/ 2) in semi-warm climates (18 ° to 22 °C) with a rainfall regime between 1 500 and 2, 000 mm and at an altitude between 1, 100 and 1 500 m. They extend over an area of 7 163. 47 ha. Medium-potential areas cover 28 143. 75 ha, low-potential areas 62 130. 65 ha, and very-low potential areas 58 411. 38 ha. This agro-ecological zoning of Coffea arabica is a valuable technical instrument based on national and international experiences and information on the natural conditions prevalent in the municipality of Atoyac de Alvarez. The updating of a database on geomorphological, climatic and soil conditions will help to devise strategies for the achievement of higher crop yields. This approach and methodology can be implemented in any geographical setting with the necessary map scales adjustments and evaluation of the local agro-ecological features. It has the potential to contribute to government and business initiatives alike for the planning and management of coffee areas of their promotion...|$|E
40|$|GIS-based {{measurements}} {{that combine}} native raster and native vector data {{are commonly used}} in environmental assessments. Most of these measurements can be calculated using either raster or vector data formats and processing methods. Raster processes are more commonly used {{because they can be}} significantly faster computationally than vector, but error is introduced in converting <b>vector</b> data <b>to</b> <b>raster.</b> This conversion error has been widely studied and quantified, but the impact on environmental assessment results has not been investigated. We examined four GIS-based measurements commonly used in environmental assessments for approximately 1000 watersheds in the state of Maryland and Washington, D. C. Each metric was calculated using vector and raster methods, and estimated values were compared using a paired t-test, Spearman rank correlation, and cluster analyses. Paired t-tests were used to determine the statistical significance of quantitative differences between methods, and Spearman rank correlation and cluster analyses were used to evaluate the impact of the differences on environmental assessments. Paired t-test results indicated significant quantitative differences between methods for three of the four metrics. However, Spearman ranks and cluster analyses indicated that the quantitative differences would not affect environmental assessment results. Spearman rank correlations between vector and raster values were greater than 0. 98 for all comparisons. Cluster analyses resulted in identical assignment for 88 percent to over 98 percent of watersheds analyzed among vector and various raster methods...|$|R
