50|$|If using verifiable secret sharing, n tellers {{will replace}} the single {{election}} administrator. Each <b>voter</b> <b>will</b> distribute one share of its secret vote to {{every one of the}} n tellers. This way the privacy of the voter is preserved and the first condition is satisfied. Reconstruction of the election's result is easy, if there exist enough tellers to discover polynomial P. The interactive proof can be generalized slightly to allow verification of the vote shares. Each <b>voter</b> <b>will</b> prove (in the distribution of the secret share phase) to the tellers that his vote is legitimate using the five steps of the interactive proof.|$|R
50|$|An {{election}} is immediate if the <b>voterâ€™s</b> <b>will</b> determines the result directly. The process {{of an election}} based on lists compiled by the political parties is, however, compatible with the principle of an immediate election.|$|R

5000|$|Third, {{the final}} {{possibility}} is a [...] "behavioural response" [...] {{which is similar}} to a cognitive response.

50|$|Another {{strategy}} is {{to vote for the}} top half of the candidates, the candidates that have an above-median utility.

50|$|These views {{tend not}} {{to be related to}} the {{particular}} voter in any rationally self-interested way, and so voters are genuinely not being subject to any direct economic penalties for choosing irrational policies.

40|$|The Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem {{states that}} every non-dictatorial {{election}} rule among {{at least three}} alternatives can be strategically manipulated.
