40|$|ABSTRACT: Verification {{scientists}} and practitioners came {{together at the}} 5 th International Verification Methods Workshop in Melbourne, Australia, in December 2011 to discuss methods for evaluating forecasts within {{a wide variety of}} applications. Progress has been made in many areas including improved <b>verification</b> <b>reporting,</b> wider use of diagnostic verification, development of new scores and techniques for difficult problems, and evaluation of forecasts for applications using meteorological information. There are many interesting challenges, particularly the improvement of methods to verify high resolution ensemble forecasts, seamless predictions spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales, and multivariate forecasts. Greater efforts are needed to make best use of new observations, forge greater links between data assimilation and verification, and develop better and more intuitive forecast verification products for end-users.

40|$|AbstractThe {{existing}} interpretation in {{the lightning}} literature, based on field measurements, defines recoil leaders as negative leaders. However recoil leaders are floating conductors, and, {{based on this}} physical assumption, they should be defined as bipolar and bidirectional leaders. This physics-based assumption has never previously been verified experimentally. Such <b>verification,</b> <b>reported</b> in this paper, has been obtained from observations of branched upward positive leaders from a tall tower using a high-speed video system synchronized with electric and magnetic field change and luminosity measurements on the ground. The analysis of these observations clearly reveals the nature of recoil and dart leaders as bidirectional and bipolar electrodeless discharges that develop from a small region along a path of the decayed channels of a previous positive leader, or a positively charged return stroke of negative CG flashes...|$|R
