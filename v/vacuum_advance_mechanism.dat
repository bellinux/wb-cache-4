5000|$|The first-generation Y-block was the 317 cuin L, which {{replaced}} the undersquare 337 cuin L flathead V8 on all Lincolns in the 1952 model {{year and was}} produced through 1954's. The 317 was oversquare, as was rapidly becoming the fashion, with a bore of 3.800 in and a stroke of 3.500 in. Power output was 160 hp (119 kW); higher compression, larger intake valves, a Holley four-barrel carburetor, improved intake and exhaust, and a more aggressive camshaft the next year increased it to 205 hp (153 kW). The engine was unchanged in 1954 except for the <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> <b>mechanism.</b> These engines used the same solid valve lifters as Ford truck engines, and were to power the [...] "Mexican Road Race Lincolns". The 317 {{was replaced by the}} 341 for automobile applications in the 1955 model year. Like the 279, the 317 was also used in heavy-duty truck applications for the 1954 model year only.|$|E

50|$|EEC-III uses a Duraspark III module (brown grommet where wires emerge) and a Duraspark II {{ignition}} coil. A resistance wire {{is used in}} {{the primary}} circuit. The distributors in EEC-III (and later) systems eliminate conventional mechanical and <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> All timing is controlled by the engine computer, which is capable of firing the spark plug at any point within a 50-degree range depending on calibration. This increased spark capability requires greater separation of adjacent distributor cap electrodes to prevent cross-fire, resulting in a large-diameter distributor cap.|$|R
50|$|Certain 1981-83 models {{used the}} EEC-III system, {{which uses a}} Dura-Spark III module (brown grommet where wires emerge) and a Dura-Spark II {{ignition}} coil. A resistance wire {{is used in the}} primary circuit. The distributors in EEC-III (and later) systems eliminate conventional mechanical and <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> All timing is controlled by the engine computer, which is capable of firing the spark plug at any point within a 50-degree range depending on calibration. This increased spark capability requires greater separation of adjacent distributor cap electrodes to prevent cross-fire, another reason for its large-diameter distributor cap. This system is very similar to the systems used at MSD; MSD used the Duraspark during R&D.|$|R
50|$|Spark timing, {{relative}} to piston position, {{is based on}} static (initial or base) timing without mechanical advance. The distributor's centrifugal timing <b>advance</b> <b>mechanism</b> makes the spark occur sooner as engine speed increases. Many of these engines will also use a <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> that advances timing during light loads and deceleration, independent of the centrifugal advance. This typically applies to automotive use, marine gasoline engines generally use a similar system but without <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} basic types of HEI control modules, the four-pin, five-pin, and seven-pin modules. The four-pin module was used on {{conventional}} carbureted engines and uses conventional mechanical timing controls (<b>vacuum</b> and centrifugal <b>advance</b> <b>mechanisms).</b> The five-pin module {{was introduced in}} 1978 and was an early attempt at electronic timing control. The five-pin module contains a provision for connecting a knock sensor. The seven-pin module is used on early computer-controlled engines. The seven-pin module contains no mechanical timing control mechanisms as the computer controls ignition timing. Late 1980's GM cars and trucks used a slim distributor cap HEI with a separate ignition coil on throttle body injection equipped engines. These distributors were not stand-alone units {{because they did not}} contain mechanical timing controls.|$|R
50|$|The marine {{distributor}} {{does not}} have a <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance.</b> <b>Vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> is normally actuated at high engine revolutions per minute (rpm) in low load situations - and this situation generally does not occur in the marine environment. Under normal operation, high rpm generally means high engine load.|$|R
50|$|Electrical or {{mechanical}} switches {{may be used}} {{to prevent}} or alter <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> under certain conditions. Early emissions electronics would engage some in relation to oxygen sensor signals or activation of emissions-related equipment. It was also common to prevent {{some or all of the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> in certain gears to prevent detonation due to lean-burning engines.|$|R
50|$|One {{source for}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> {{is a small}} opening located in {{the wall of the}} {{throttle}} body or carburetor adjacent to but slightly upstream of the edge of the throttle plate. This is called a ported vacuum. The effect of having the opening here is that {{there is little or no}} vacuum at idle, hence little or no advance. Other vehicles use vacuum directly from the intake manifold. This provides full engine vacuum (and hence, full <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance)</b> at idle. Some <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> units have two vacuum connections, one at each side of the actuator membrane, connected to both manifold vacuum and ported vacuum. These units will both advance and retard the ignition timing.|$|R

50|$|The second {{method used}} to advance (or retard) the {{ignition}} timing is called <b>vacuum</b> timing <b>advance.</b> This method {{is almost always}} used in addition to mechanical timing advance. It generally increases fuel economy and driveability, particularly at lean mixtures. It also increases engine life through more complete combustion, leaving less unburned fuel to wash away the cylinder wall lubrication (piston ring wear), and less lubricating oil dilution (bearings, camshaft life, etc.). <b>Vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> works by using a manifold <b>vacuum</b> source to <b>advance</b> the timing at low to mid engine load conditions by rotating the position sensor (contact points, hall effect or optical sensor, reluctor stator, etc.) mounting plate in the distributor {{with respect to the}} distributor shaft. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> is diminished at wide open throttle (WOT), causing the timing advance to return to the base advance in addition to the mechanical advance.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} time <b>advance</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{on the behavior of}} agents in combat simulations using some simple scenarios relevant to combat and agent-based models. We implement these simulation designs in two modeling packages that illustrate the differences between discrete-time simulation (DTS) and discrete-event simulation (DES) methodologies. Many combat models use DTS as their simulation time <b>advance</b> <b>mechanism.</b> We demonstrate that the presence and size of the time step as a modeling component can have a substantial impact on the basic characteristics of agent and simulation performance. We show that the use of a DTS method can degrade the modeling accuracy of changes in agent sensor range and detection outcomes, and also can compromise the ability of agents to travel to specific target destinations in a spatial simulation environment. We conclude that DES methodology successfully addresses these problems and is preferred as a time <b>advance</b> <b>mechanism</b> in these situations. ...|$|R

50|$|On some vehicles, a {{temperature}} sensing switch will apply manifold vacuum to the <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> system when {{the engine is}} hot or cold, and ported vacuum at normal operating temperature. This is a version of emissions control; the ported vacuum allowed carburetor adjustments for a leaner idle mixture. At high engine temperature, the increased advance raised engine speed to allow the cooling system to operate more efficiently. At low temperature the advance allowed the enriched warm-up mixture to burn more completely, providing better cold-engine running.|$|R

50|$|The {{distributor}} also {{houses the}} centrifugal advance unit: {{a set of}} hinged weights attached to the distributor shaft, that cause the breaker points mounting plate to slightly rotate and advance the spark timing with higher engine revolutions per minute (rpm). In addition, the distributor has a <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> unit that advances the timing even further {{as a function of}} the vacuum in the inlet manifold. Usually there is also a capacitor attached to the distributor. The capacitor is connected parallel to the breaker points, to suppress sparking to prevent excessive wear of the points.|$|R

Beside the fuel-injection, a significant change for the Z24i was the addition of an optical crank angle sensor in the distributor rather than a <b>vacuum</b> <b>advance</b> and ignition module.
