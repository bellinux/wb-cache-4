40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the performance of}} rats in a delayed non matching-to-position task using an automated visual memory apparatus. A new testing procedure {{has been used to}} restrict the problem of motor mediation. In this procedure the rat must first activate a sample stimulus (either the right or left <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>panel).</b> It has then to respond to one of three retractable levers that were extended throughout the retention delay before it can receive a reinforcer (reward pellet vs. nothing) for a response made to either one of the two visual stimulus display panels. A response on the levers was independent from a response on the stimulus display panels. These retractable levers were set in a compartment that protruded 15 cm from the back wall below the display panels, forming a platform which the rat needed to climb in order to reach the stimulus display panels. By requiring the rat to respond to one of these levers the rat could not linger by the correct display panel. Furthermore, as the rat could not anticipate the location of the response lever which would permitted the trial to continue nor the duration of the retention delays before a lever press allow access to the choice stimuli, the rat could not position itself by the correct panel during the retention delay. Rats were able to learn this task readily and perform above chance over delays of up to 16 sec, even though the task demands were likely to restrict any motor mediation strategies...|$|E

They should not exceed 300 words and should be typed double spaced Reducing the toll of road traffic accidents Rodger Charlton and Gary Smith made numerous important and useful points in their editorial (October 2003 JRSM 1) but it was disappointing to see them fail to give credit to what has actually been achieved in {{reducing the number of}} casualties from road traffic accidents. They have overlooked the point that, in about thirty years during which there has been an enormous {{increase in the number of}} vehicles and the number of miles travelled, road deaths have actually been halved in the UK. This has been achieved by a combination of the drink-drive laws, the use of seat belts, improved vehicle design and more motorways, as well as traffic calming and control. It is wrong to give the impression that an increasing toll of road casualties is being ignored. Unfortunately, in their suggestions to improve the situation further, the authors omitted to mention that pedestrians and cyclists are not subject to the drink-drive legal limit and cannot be breath-tested, and whilst criticizing the use of mobile telephones did not at the same time point out the dangers of selecting, lighting and smoking cigarettes or of using <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>panels</b> associated with tracking devices. The fact that progress is still being made in road safety is evident from the latest figures which show that there was a 3 % reduction in road casualties between 2001 and 2002 whilst the reduction in road deaths was 19 %. There is certainly still a great deal that can be done, but please give credit to those people who have worked hard for many years to bring about substantial improvements...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a novel tricolor {{dot matrix}} display {{system in which}} all the LEDs are {{modulated}} and encoded with audio information is presented. The novelty is on the concurrent use of the tricolor LEDs for simultaneous <b>visual</b> message <b>display</b> and audio signal transmission in a free space optical link. The system is comprised of a tricolor LED dot matrix <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> with an interface circuit to a computer, an audio signal transmitter, and a receiver. The system further comprises an executive program that runs on the computer for the display control of characters, decorative pattern or messages on the <b>display</b> <b>panel.</b> The receiver, combined with a speaker, is located at some distance from the display system. The receiver is designed to demodulate the optically transmitted audio information and reproduce the messages with the speaker. For modulating emission of tricolor LEDs, an oscillator is used to vary the frequency of on/off periods of the LEDs. The frequency of flicker is high enough to be indistinguishable by human eye and hence display appears to be constantly illuminated. This is a new generation of tricolor LED dot matrix display where in addition to the usual function of LED display, they concurrently provide audio broadcasting through the visible light rays transmitted by the <b>display</b> <b>panel</b> or assembly. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Paying {{attention}} {{is a critical}} first step toward learning. For children in primary school classrooms there can be many things to attend to other than {{the focus of a}} lesson, such as <b>visual</b> <b>displays</b> on classroom walls. The aim {{of this study was to}} use eye-tracking techniques to explore the impact of <b>visual</b> <b>displays</b> on attention and learning for children. Critically, we explored these issues for children developing typically and for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Both groups of children watched videos of a teacher delivering classroom activities— 2 of “story-time” and 2 mini lessons. Half of the videos each child saw contained high levels of classroom <b>visual</b> <b>displays</b> in the background (high <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> [HVD]) and half had none (no <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> [NVD]). Children completed worksheets after the mini lessons to measure learning. During viewing of all videos children’s eye movements were recorded. The presence of <b>visual</b> <b>displays</b> had a significant impact on attention for all children, but to a greater extent for children with ASD. <b>Visual</b> <b>displays</b> also had an impact on learning from the mini lessons, whereby children had poorer learning scores in the HVD compared with the NVD lesson. Individual differences in age, verbal, nonverbal, and attention abilities were important predictors of learning, but time spent attending the <b>visual</b> <b>displays</b> in HVD was the most important predictor. This novel and timely investigation has implications for the use of classroom <b>visual</b> <b>displays</b> for all children, but particularly for children with ASD...|$|R

30|$|Researchers {{working within}} an SFL {{theoretical}} framework, ([O'Halloran, 2005, Lemke, 2003, Schleppegrell, 2007]), have shown how multiple meaning-making systems {{are used in}} mathematical texts. [O'Halloran's (2005)] analysis of mathematical texts demonstrates how three semiotic systems, mathematical symbolism, <b>visual</b> <b>display,</b> and natural language together construct mathematical meaning in ways that natural language alone does not. For instance, [O'Halloran (2005)] shows that mathematics argumentation in texts typically unfolds as problem-solution. In order to solve the problem, writers of mathematics will arrange mathematical symbols in patterned ways so that they encode a limited range of meanings. In addition, the writer must also include visual images, such as statistical graphs, geometric diagrams, {{and other kinds of}} drawn or computer-generated <b>visual</b> <b>displays.</b> Through these <b>visual</b> <b>displays,</b> the writer illustrates mathematical meanings in a space-time format. However, mathematical symbolism and <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> may be relatively limited in functionality, and the writer must accompany the symbols and <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> with natural language. Natural language functions serves to disambiguate and clarify meanings when the meaning potential of mathematical symbolism and <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> are exhausted.|$|R

40|$|Abstract We have {{developed}} a gesture input system that provides a common interaction technique across mobile, wearable and ubiquitous computing devices of diverse form factors. In this paper, we combine our gestural input technique with speech output and test {{whether or not the}} absence of a <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> impairs usability in this kind of multimodal interaction. This is of particular relevance to mobile, wearable and ubiquitous systems where <b>visual</b> <b>displays</b> may be restricted or unavailable. We conducted the evaluation using a prototype for a system combining gesture input and speech output to provide information to patients in a hospital Accident and Emergency Department. A group of participants was instructed to access various services using gestural inputs. The services were delivered by automated speech output. Throughout their tasks, these participants could see a <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> on which a GUI presented the available services and their corresponding gestures. Another group of participants performed the same tasks but without this <b>visual</b> <b>display.</b> It was predicted that the participants without the <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> would make more incorrect gestures and take longer to perform correct gestures than the participants with the <b>visual</b> <b>display.</b> We found {{no significant difference in the}} number of incor-rect gestures made. We also found that participants with the <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> took longer than participants without it.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how the handling of visual media objects is implemented in the visual information retrieval project VizIR. Essentially, four areas are concerned: media access, media representation in user interfaces, visualisation of media-related data and media transport over the network. The paper offers detailed technical descriptions of the solutions developed in VizIR for these areas. Unified media access for images and video is implemented through class MediaContent. This class contains methods to access the view on a media object {{at any point in}} time as well as methods to change the colour model and read/write format parameters (size, length, frame-rate). Based on this low-level-API class VisualCube allows accessing spatio-temporal areas in temporal media randomly. Transformer-classes allow to modify visual objects in a very simple but effective way. Visualisation of media object is implemented in class MediaRenderer. Each MediaRenderer represents one media object and is responsible for any aspect of its visualisation. In the paper examples for reasonable implementations of MediaRenderer-classes are presented. Visualisation of mediarelated data is strongly connected to MediaRenderer. MediaRenderer is to a large extent responsible for <b>displaying</b> <b>visual</b> <b>panels</b> created by other framework components. Finally, media object transport in VizIR is based on the Realtime Transfer Protocol (for media objects) and XML-messaging (for XML-data) ...|$|R

However, the VE participant, being human, is multimodal by nature. Therefore, in order to validate more accurately the levels of auditory and visual fidelity that are required in a virtual environment, a better understanding is needed of the intersensory or crossmodal effects between the auditory and visual sense modalities. To identify whether any pertinent auditory-visual cross-modal perception phenomena exist, 108 subjects participated in three experiments which were completely automated using HTML, Java, and JavaScript programming languages. <b>Visual</b> and auditory <b>display</b> quality perceptions were measured intra- and intermodally by manipulating the pixel resolution of the <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> and Gaussian white noise level, and by manipulating the sampling frequency of the auditory display and Gaussian white noise level.
