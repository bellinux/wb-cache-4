5000|$|Nonwovens {{can also}} start with films and fibrillate, serrate or <b>vacuum-form</b> them with {{patterned}} holes. Fiberglass nonwovens are of two basic types. Wet laid mat or [...] "glass tissue" [...] use wet-chopped, heavy denier fibers in the 6 to 20 micrometre diameter range. Flame attenuated mats or [...] "batts" [...] use discontinuous fine denier fibers in the 0.1 to 6 range. The latter is similar, though run at much higher temperatures, to melt-blown thermoplastic nonwovens. Wet laid mat {{is almost always}} wet resin bonded with a curtain coater, while batts are usually spray bonded with wet or dry resin. An unusual process produces polyethylene fibrils in a Freon-like fluid, forming them into a paper-like product and then calendering them to create Tyvek.|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundMedulloblastoma, a {{primitive}} neuroectodermal tumour {{growing in the}} cerebellum, {{is one of the}} most sensitive childhood brain tumours to radiation therapy. The most common malignant CNS tumour of children is medulloblastoma with an overall incidence among children aged 0 – 19 years of 16 – 20 % of all paediatric brain tumours. Radiotherapy is an essential method of treatment for these tumours, but surgery is the primary treatment of choice in medulloblastoma. Postoperative radiation therapy has a significant impact on local control and overall survival. AimMedulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumour of children. The tumour is sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is an essential method of treatment for these tumours, but surgery is the primary treatment of choice in medulloblastoma. Materials/MethodsBetween January 1997 and March 2005 there were in this study post-operatively irradiated a total number of 33 paediatric patients aged under 15 years (median age 6. 6 years) with medulloblastoma. All tumours were histologically proven and were located infratentorially in the posterior fossa. All of the patients were irradiated with a dose of 24 – 36 Gy to the whole craniospinal axis and boost with conformal therapy restricted to the tumour bed to the total dose of 50 – 54 Gy (30 – 36 Gy “high risk”, 24 – 30 Gy “standard risk” group). 26 patients (78 %) received chemotherapy. Patients with craniospinal irradiation were placed in the supine position and fixed by a <b>vacuum-form</b> body immobilizer and head mask. Irradiation was performed using standard fractionation (5 fractions per week) with a single dose of 1. 5 – 1. 8 Gy for craniospinal axis by photon beam (6 MV) of the linear accelerator. ResultsThe median overall survival for the whole group was 55. 3 months. The median disease-free survival was 20. 6 months. The overall survival rate at 5 years was 41 %; 8 patients (24 %) died. No relationship was found between survival and age, sex or tumour size. Endocrine deficits occurred in 30 % (8 patients of the group were hypothyroid, growth retardation occurred in 7 patients). ConclusionsResults of overall and disease-free survival and side-effects of the technique of craniospinal axis irradiation in supine position are comparable with results of the technique in prone position...|$|R

50|$|Recently, a more {{aesthetic}} {{version of}} the Hawley retainer has been developed. For this alternative, the front metal wire is replaced with a clear wire called the ASTICS. This retainer {{is intended to be}} adjustable similarly to the traditional Hawley retainer, which is not practical with <b>vacuum-formed</b> retainers. The original clear bow named QCM, was developed to eliminate the look of wire across the facial surface of the arch. Excessive breakage has made this impractical for younger patients.|$|E

50|$|Original {{equipment}} manufacturers (OEMs) utilize heavy gauge vacuum formed components for production quantities {{in the range}} of 250-3000 units per year. <b>Vacuum-formed</b> components can be used in place of complex fabricated sheet metal, fiberglass, or plastic injection molding. Typical industry examples include kiosks and automated teller machines, enclosures for medical imaging and diagnostic equipment such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines, engine covers in a truck cab, and railcar interior trim and seat components. Vacuum formers are also often used by hobbyists, for applications such as RC cars and masks.|$|E
50|$|Being {{based on}} the MQB platform, the B8 Passat has more {{interior}} space than the last generation model despite being minimally shorter and 18 mm lower than the last generation model. As the front wheels have been moved forward, its wheelbase has been extended by 79 mm, resulting in a shorter front overhang and a bigger cabin. The B8 Passat also weighs 73 kg less, due to the usage of lightweight <b>vacuum-formed</b> steel, and is only offered with turbocharger-equipped engines ranging from 1.4 to 2.0 litre to keep weight and fuel consumption as low as possible.|$|E
50|$|In Destiny of the Daleks (1979) {{many of the}} Dalek props feature an {{attachment}} resembling a small stub aerial projecting {{from the top of}} the dome. Six crude, hollow, <b>vacuum-formed</b> Dalek props were also created. They were primarily used during location filming of the serial's finale, although several of them can also be seen in the background of some studio shots. They can be recognised by their thick neck struts and the absence of dome aerials and appendage ball joints. Production photographs taken at the time reveal that they also lacked hemispheres on the rear skirt panels.|$|E
50|$|Of the {{incidental}} costume designs Hudson devised for the show, {{perhaps the}} most striking were the white, cigarette-quilted outfits for the exquisite android Movellans in Destiny of the Daleks, the faintly chiton-esque yellow robes for the Argolin in The Leisure Hiveband the Gundan Warriors for Warriors' Gate. The armor for the Gundans, gorgeously conceived and finished, typifies Hudson's capacity to produce safe, comfortable, impressive costumes on a tight budget: the armor was actually made of thin, <b>vacuum-formed</b> plastic, and given is pewter finish by metal deposition, while the grills on the helmets were made from junked mail trays.|$|E
50|$|Pyro was a {{prolific}} and well-known manufacturer of ship models. Alan Bussie of oldmodelkits.com, {{who has done}} extensive research into the company's history, notes that the molds for Pyro’s very first assembly kits, a series of warships in “box scale”, were cut either in 1952 or 1953. These were the USS Missouri (kit #146); USS Chicago (#147); USS Shangri-La (#148), and USS Sumner (#149). With {{the success of these}} kits, Pyro quickly followed with a series of small sailing vessels (Mayflower (#168); Barbary Pirate (#169); USS Constitution (#170), and Santa Maria (#171)) This second series included plastic hulls, wooden masts and <b>vacuum-formed</b> sails.|$|E

Other works reflecting the ethos of the Washington Color School include Sam Gilliam's suspended paintings (by contrast they are almost baroque in sensibility), Rockne Krebs' transparent sculptures, light and laser works, Ed McGowin's <b>vacuum-formed</b> pieces which he was ending and moving towards a more personal art (tableau), Bill Christenberry's neon works, which led him to deal more directly with his roots, {{and the work of}} Bob Stackhouse and Tom Green.|$|E
50|$|Other {{types of}} blister packs consist of carded {{packaging}} where goods such as toys, hardware, and electrical items are contained between a specially made paperboard card and clear pre-formed plastic such as PVC. The consumer can visually examine the product through the transparent plastic. The plastic shell is <b>vacuum-formed</b> around a mold {{so it can}} contain the item snugly. The card is colored and designed depending on the item inside, and the PVC is affixed to the card using heat and pressure to activate an adhesive (heat seal coating) on the blister card. The adhesive is strong enough so that the pack may hang on a peg, but weak enough so that the package can be easily opened (in theory). Sometimes, with large items, the card (cold seal card) has a perforated window for access.|$|E
5000|$|The Wills Imperial Tobacco Factory has an {{established}} history with art {{and it was}} Wills' policy that the building should always reflect contemporary art of its time.

[...] Old photographs of Bristol were enlarged and a selection of pipes, old cigarette, tobacco and cigar label were hung in private offices in <b>vacuum-formed</b> Perspex box frames, all on coloured fabric mounts to match coloured chair upholstery. The Wills collections were works by 20th-century British artists and were hung in the director’s suite. A collection of contemporary prints hung in various offices alongside a selection of oil portraits of past employees.|$|E
50|$|The best-known {{removable}} retainer is the Hawley retainer, {{which consists}} of a metal wire that typically surrounds the six anterior teeth and keeps them in place. Named for its inventor, Dr. Charles A. Hawley, the labial wire, or Hawley bow, incorporates 2 omega loops for adjustment. It is anchored in an acrylic baseplate that sits in the palate (roof of the mouth). The advantage {{of this type of}} retainer is that the metal wires can be adjusted to finish treatment and continue minor movement of the anterior teeth as needed. It also benefits from being robust and rigid, easy to construct and allows prosthetic tooth/teeth to be added onto. The main disadvantages of this type of retainer is its inferior aesthetics, interference with speech, risk of fracture and inferior retention of lower incisors in comparison to <b>vacuum-formed</b> retainers.|$|E
5000|$|Price makes digital {{paintings}} (most notably, his Calendar Paintings series from 2003-04), videos, writes {{texts and}} essays distributed as free PDF files on the internet, creates <b>vacuum-formed</b> reliefs, laminated wood 'silhouette' sculptures, and artworks on crumpled mylar referring to Jihadist internet videos. He also has presented numerous noise music and audio art works {{as well as}} fabric 'garment sculptures' that resemble business envelopes and are fabricated by couture factories based in Garment District, Manhattan. But Price makes frequent pivots between materials and contexts, based on {{his work as a}} new media art theorist. This pivot strategy is summed up by Price as follows: [...] "Sometimes it’s good to go forward and then double back, and circle around again. To those who turned their feet around so that their tracks would confuse their pursuers: why not walk backward?".|$|E
5000|$|The eighth {{generation}} {{model of the}} Passat was introduced in November 2014 in Continental Europe and in January 2015 in the United Kingdom as a four-door saloon and estate.

To reduce weight, lightweight materials such as aluminium and <b>vacuum-formed</b> steel have been utilised. According to {{the chairman of the board}} of Volkswagen, Martin Winterkorn, the B8 is [...] " ... a premium car without the premium price", indicating that the Passat nameplate was moved to the compact executive car segment, as opposed to the previous {{generation model}}s that were conceived as large family cars., although some auto journalists have criticised this strategy since it effectively puts the Passat in competition with the Audi A4 - which is expected to move further upmarket for its B9 generation, due for launch in late 2015.|$|E

5000|$|Robby's bulky {{barrel-shaped}} torso (a sly {{reference to}} Bob Kinoshita's earlier {{job as a}} washing machine designer) featured a front panel fitted with a rectangular flap at the top (into which samples of any substance could be inserted for Robby to analyse and replicate); underneath the slot were two rotating discs fitted with small flashing lights and below that a row of five buttons that moved in and out. Robby's thick, stubby arms were connected to his body with plastic ball-joints that fitted into matching sockets in the torso, allowing the joints {{a small amount of}} rotational movement. The arms could also be slightly extended and this section was covered with a concertina-type tubular rubber sheath. Robby's three-fingered hands were also made of rubber, finished with metallic paint. The chest section attached to the leg section with special locking clips. The bottom section of the suit hinged {{at the top of the}} legs, allowing Robby to both bend forward and swing each leg backward and forward slightly enabling him to walk with relative ease (albeit with rather small and stiff steps). Robby's legs were made from interlocking globes of <b>vacuum-formed</b> plastic which were connected by internal jointing that permitted the entire leg to bend slightly but cleverly concealed the movement of the hips and knees of the human operator inside.|$|E
5000|$|As rugged as the Blackfoot and its {{variants}} were, {{the design}} {{suffered from a}} number of problems with its drivetrain. Its hexagonal-shaped [...] "dogbone" [...] axles, while allowing for an independent rear suspension, were extremely prone to wear because of the oversized wheels and tires as was the nylon and pot metal-geared differential. Interestingly, the pot metal parts generally wore out before the nylon parts did. Miniature ball bearings were an extra cost option to replace the nylon bushings packed with the model for both the transmission and wheels, but were a necessity since rapid wear of the bushings meant a complete overhaul of the transmission and partial disassembly of the rear suspension unless the kit was assembled with bearings from the outset. The expensive, heavy plastic bodies (with a replacement cost roughly half the price of an entire kit) made the model prone to rollover, eventually resulting in a badly scratched, unattractive replica. The tires themselves, even the spiked ones, were basically unsuitable for the off-road situations that the kit was intended for. Several R/C companies rose to the challenge, especially four Southern California companies: MRP, Pro-Line, Thorp Corporation and Robinson Racing. MRP specialized in heavy-duty modified parts, Pro-Line was (and is) a highly regarded manufacturer of R/C wheels, tires and bodies while Thorp and Robinson engineered expensive but rugged differentials and axles, allowing the use of much more powerful, R/C-specific motors than the Mabuchi RS-540 shipped with the kit; this motor was originally designed for use in heavy-duty computer printers. A North Royalton, Ohio-based company, Parma Corporation, made a series of replacement bodies <b>vacuum-formed</b> in lightweight, clear polycarbonate plastic including a direct replacement whose tooling was made from an original styrene body.|$|E
5000|$|Scott had {{cemented}} {{his reputation}} as a cult label with fervid fans, particularly in Asia, but he was still on the fringe of the fashion establishment, as he was considered neither [...] "serious" [...] nor [...] "commercial". He closed one show in 2001 by throwing fake banknotes with his face printed on them into the audience. At the close of another show, he shouted: [...] "Vive l’avant-garde!", and left yellow T-shirts stamped with the message on every seat. In 2006, Scott started his ongoing collaboration with the French leather-goods company Longchamp, which makes bags for front-row guests at his fashion shows. Scott first worked with Adidas in 2002 for the [...] "!Signed" [...] project, for which he created a silk jacquard with a motif of money scattered around with his own likeness replacing that of George Washington. The design was on the Adidas classic high top model, the Forum. The shoe was handmade in the Adidas factory in Scheinfeld, Germany. There were only 100 pairs made: 50 went to Scott and 50 went to Adidas. Scott would revisit the design with Money Wings 2.0 in Fall/Winter 2013. However, his best-known Adidas collaboration came in 2008, when Adidas Originals launched Scott's collection of footwear and apparel that included JS Wings (winged high-tops) and JS Bears (furry sneakers with teddy bear heads). With early co-signs from rappers like Lil Wayne, Scott's footwear gained him mass appeal. His sneakers are considered [...] "some of the most eye-catching sneakers ever seen", making [...] "an indisputable imprint on the shoe landscape". Over the years, his iconic wings adorned many different Adidas silhouettes. He also applied them to other objects for other clients, including Smart cars and baby prams. He collaborated with Swatch in 2011, creating three watch designs that were hailed as the return of Swatch to its [...] "uber-fun Eighties roots" [...] with Scott's [...] "pop aesthetic, fun twist and overstated form". Scott starred in the Adidas 2012 print and video campaign with Nicki Minaj, Sky Ferreira and 2NE1. Madonna's dancers in the 2012 Super Bowl halftime show wore Jeremy Scott track suits for Adidas Originals. In June 2012, Adidas decided that a pair of sneakers designed by Scott called the JS Roundhouse Mids would not be sold after the shoes were criticised for their bright yellow handcuffs which, as some believed, were [...] "shackles" [...] alluding to slavery. Scott denied that the shoes {{had anything to do with}} slavery, stating it was a reference to the children's toy My Pet Monster. For his Fall 2012 collection, Scott introduced 1990s nostalgia, with several computer references like a printed gloved-hand cursor and '90s-era Mac screenshots. He made a show-closing homage to Lisa Frank with a <b>vacuum-formed</b> plexiglass bustier encrusted in hundreds of Frank stickers. In February 2013, Scott was accused of plagiarising designs from Santa Cruz Skateboards. Santa Cruz and Scott reached a settlement whereby Scott ceased production of his collection. He debuted his first fragrance for Adidas on February 1, 2015, in a glass replica of his Adidas winged sneakers. In the 2016 film Suicide Squad, the character Harley Quinn wears high-top heels from Jeremy Scott’s 2014 collaboration with Adidas.|$|E
