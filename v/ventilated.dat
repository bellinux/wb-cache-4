Atrium supports natural <b>ventilate</b> and {{it is good for}} <b>ventilate.</b> Analysis on atrium through several ways of winded pressure ventilation heated pressure ventilation and mechanical ventilation. Then uses <b>ventilate</b> Design and Ground Source Heat Pump to find suitable methods for design. At last, there is conclusion on different <b>ventilate</b> strategy for day and night, the way to come true and <b>ventilate</b> strategic management of technology. The purpose is finding the suitable methods for Public building energy saving and provide basis for <b>ventilate</b> design for energy saving building...|$|R
40|$|A biocalorimeter {{and waste}} {{management}} system is provided for making metabolic heat release measurements of animals or humans in a calorimeter (enclosure) using ambient air as a low velocity source of <b>ventilating</b> air through the enclosure. A shroud forces <b>ventilating</b> air to {{pass over the}} enclosure from an end open to ambient air {{at the end of}} the enclosure opposite its <b>ventilating</b> air inlet end and closed around the inlet end of the enclosure in order to obviate the need for regulating ambient air temperature. Psychrometers for measuring dry- and wet-bulb temperature of <b>ventilating</b> air make it possible to account for the sensible and latent heat additions to the <b>ventilating</b> air. A waste removal system momentarily recirculates high velocity air in a closed circuit through the calorimeter wherein a sudden rise in moisture is detected in the <b>ventilating</b> air from the outlet...|$|R

The authors present a case of cardiac arrest caused by tension pneumothorax in a 9 -month-old girl who underwent <b>ventilating</b> bronchoscopy for foreign body (peanut) removal. Tension pneumothorax was due to tracheobronchial lacerations caused by a bronchoscope. The patient was successfully resuscitated by cardiopulmonary resuscitation and chest tube insertion.

Falkenberg and Næsheim, both doctors, began giving her {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR). The rescue helicopter soon arrived and Bågenholm was brought to the Tromsø University Hospital in an hour. The helicopter emergency team continued to give her CPR during the flight, and she was <b>ventilated</b> with oxygen. She was also treated with a defibrillator, but to no effect.|$|E
5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly <b>ventilated</b> than earlier ships because the {{ammunition}} hoists passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E

5|$|Another type of {{atmospheric}} water collector {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this {{makes it possible to}} extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort have proved to be very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is <b>ventilated</b> at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, the greenhouse effect increases the temperature, and, as in solar desalination pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, Clifford's Tower and the Waud {{house were}} {{purchased}} by the county of Yorkshire {{at the cost of}} £8,800 (£665,000 at 2009 prices). The new prison buildings, designed by architects P. F. Robinson and G. T. Andrews, were constructed in a Tudor Gothic style, including a gatehouse 35 feet (11 metres) high and a radial prison block, protected by a long, high stone wall. The prison, considered to be the strongest such building in England, was built entirely of stone to be both secure and fireproof. Dark grey gritstone was used in the construction to produce a forbidding appearance, although the prison itself was considered healthy and well <b>ventilated.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1897, her {{daughter}} Irène was born. To support her family, Curie began {{teaching at the}} École Normale Supérieure. The Curies {{did not have a}} dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to the School of Physics and Chemistry. The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly <b>ventilated</b> and not even waterproof. They were unaware of the deleterious effects of radiation exposure attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances. The School did not sponsor her research, but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments.|$|E

5|$|The {{enclosed}} {{design of}} the Albert Dock and the direct loading and unloading of goods from warehouses meant that the complex was more secure than other docks within Liverpool. As a result it became a popular store for valuable cargoes including brandy, cotton, tea, silk, tobacco, ivory and sugar. At the same time their openness to natural light and well <b>ventilated</b> stores meant natural goods such as hemp or sugar could be kept fresher, for longer. The dock came to dominate Liverpool's far eastern trade, with over 90% of the city's silk imports from China coming through it and more generally {{half of all the}} far eastern trade income.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of limitations was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly <b>ventilated</b> steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E
