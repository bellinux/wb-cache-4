5000|$|In {{aviation}} a {{ground-controlled approach}} (GCA), {{is a type}} of service provided by air-traffic controllers whereby they guide aircraft to a safe landing, including in adverse weather conditions, based on primary radar images. Most commonly a GCA uses information from either a Precision Approach Radar (PAR, for precision approaches with <b>vertical,</b> glidepath <b>guidance)</b> or an Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR, providing a non-precision Surveillance radar approach with no glidepath guidance). The term GCA may refer to any type of ground radar guided approach such as a PAR, PAR without glideslope or ASR. When both <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>guidance</b> from the PAR is given, the approach is termed a precision approach.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} a {{study that}} drove {{the development of a}} mathematical expression in the minimum operational performance standards (MOPS) of detect-and-avoid (DAA) systems for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). This equation describes the conditions under which <b>vertical</b> maneuver <b>guidance</b> could be provided during recovery of well clear separation with a non-cooperative VFR aircraft in addition to horizontal maneuver <b>guidance.</b> Although suppressing <b>vertical</b> maneuver <b>guidance</b> in these situations increased the minimum horizontal separation from 500 to 800 feet, the maximum severity of loss of well clear increased in about 35 of the encounters compared to when a vertical maneuver was preferred and allowed. Additionally, analysis of individual cases led to the identification of a class of encounter where vertical rate error had a large effect on horizontal maneuvers due to the difficulty of making the correct left-right turn decision: crossing conflict with intruder changing altitude. These results supported allowing vertical maneuvers when UAS vertical performance exceeds the relative vertical position and velocity accuracy of the DAA tracker given the current velocity of the UAS and the relative vertical position and velocity estimated by the DAA tracker. Looking ahead, these results indicate a need to improve guidance algorithms by utilizing maneuver stability and near mid-air collision risk when determining maneuver guidance to regain well clear separation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBoth {{the design}} process and form of the {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) suboptimal guidance law (3 DSGL) are very complex. Therefore, we propose the use of two-dimensional (2 D) guidance laws to meet the guidance requirements of 3 D space. By analyzing {{the relationship between the}} flight-path angle and its projections on OXY and OXZ planes, we obtain the ideal design requirements of the guidance laws. Based on the requirements, we design a 2 D suboptimal guidance law used in the horizontal plane; combining the 2 D <b>vertical</b> suboptimal <b>guidance</b> law, we create a whole ballistic simulation of six degree-of-freedom. The results are compared with those using other three guidance modes in the case of large windage of the initial azimuth angle. When the proportional navigation guidance (PNG) law is used in the horizontal planes, the landing angle will obviously decrease. With the proposed guidance mode, the large landing angle can be realized and meet the guidance precision requirements. Moreover, the required overload can decrease to meet the control requirement. The effects of the proposed guidance mode are close to that of 3 DSGL despite its very simple form...|$|R
