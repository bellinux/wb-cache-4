5|$|In 1847, Mormon {{farmers from}} the Salt Lake area {{became the first}} people of European descent to settle the Virgin River region. In 1851, the Parowan and Cedar City, Utah areas were settled by Mormons who used the Kolob Canyons area for timber, and for grazing cattle, sheep, and horses. They prospected for mineral deposits, and {{diverted}} Kolob water to irrigate crops in the <b>valley</b> <b>below.</b> Mormon settlers named the area Kolob—in Mormon scripture, the heavenly place nearest the residence of God.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, 1879, a {{group from}} Leadville struck gold in the {{uppermost}} Roaring Fork <b>valley</b> <b>below</b> the pass. Four miles (6.4km) to the west, they established a settlement in the upper Roaring Fork Valley that eventually took the name Independence from the holiday on which it was established. The pass, the lake from which the Roaring Fork rises and another nearby mountain all took that name as well. The Twin Lakes and Roaring Fork Toll Company, established to build a road through to the camps in the lower Roaring Fork Valley, improved the original path over the pass sufficiently enough by 1880 that horses {{could be used for}} the trip.|$|E
5|$|The Germans, too, had {{suffered}} heavy casualties; the 116th Panzer Division, for example, {{had lost its}} offensive capabilities after countless attempts to break the U.S. First Army's encirclement of Aachen. This gave American and British commanders {{a false sense of}} security, believing that the Wehrmacht did not have the strength to launch a counteroffensive. Given their view {{on the state of the}} German armed forces and their need to push to the Rur, the First Army decided to drive German forces out of the Hürtgen Forest—located on the Belgian–German border—in an attempt to take a series of dams which could be used by the Germans to flood the <b>valley</b> <b>below.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ferdinand ordered 400 men {{to enter}} the saps; these men would storm the castle once the mine had been detonated. The {{remainder}} of his cavalry and foot soldiers were {{to wait in the}} fields below. Some sources assert that the fuse was lit at around 1:00 pm, although the 19th-century local historian Heinrich Joseph Floß argued that these sources are mistaken, and that the explosion clearly occurred in the morning. All sources agree that the explosion, with a dreadful crack, propelled chunks of the towers and walls high into the air. Almost half the Godesburg collapsed instantly. According to a newspaper report dated 13 January 1584, debris raining on the <b>valley</b> <b>below</b> damaged several houses, and destroyed some of them completely.|$|E
5|$|The {{defense of}} Lima Site 85 was {{assigned}} to two CIA paramilitary officers who led about 1,000 Hmong soldiers, with 200 men guarding the ridge line and the remaining 800 in the <b>valley</b> <b>below.</b> They were reinforced by a Thai Border Patrol Police battalion of 300 men. In {{the first week of}} 1968, the combined North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces probed Royal Laos Army positions in the area by launching several artillery attacks. On 10January, a Pathet Lao patrol was driven from the area by the Hmong soldiers. Fearing the explosives attached to their equipment could be detonated by incoming artillery rounds, U.S. technicians dismantled the charges and threw them over the cliff.|$|E
5|$|On October 16, Colonel Joseph R. Russ of the US 32nd Infantry Regiment {{took over}} the {{operational}} command from Moses. He was also given the 2nd Battalion of the US 17th Infantry Regiment to reinforce his right wing. After arriving on the battlefield, the US 2nd Battalion managed to wrestle Jane Russell Hill away from the Chinese on October 16, but the Americans soon {{came under heavy fire}} from Chinese machine guns in the <b>valley</b> <b>below,</b> and were forced to withdraw to the slope behind the hill on October 18. The Chinese continued to harass the American positions with small raiding parties and grenade barrages throughout that night. The Koreans fared somewhat better. A joint attack by 2nd Battalion of the ROK 17th Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the ROK 32nd Regiment captured Sniper Ridge and held it against subsequent Chinese counterattacks. For {{the first time since the}} combat began, UN forces had gained firm control of the surface, with the exception of Pike's Peak. On the afternoon of October 17, the 3rd Battalion of the US 17th Infantry Regiment relieved the 2nd Battalion of the US 31st Infantry Regiment on the left wing, while the 1st Battalion of the US 32nd Infantry Regiment was withdrawn from the pacified center.|$|E

5|$|Although the NK 6th and 7th Divisions had massed {{their troops}} {{primarily}} for the attempted breakthrough of the US 25th Infantry Division positions along the Nam and Naktong Rivers during their September offensive, the NK 6th Division continued its attacks on the area. North Korean artillery and mortar fire fell on Battle Mountain, P'il-bong and Sobuk-san, and {{during the period of}} September 1–6 there were strong local attacks and patrols by North Korean troops. The 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry, never succeeded in gaining complete possession of the southern parts of Sobuk-san, which would have given observation into the <b>valley</b> <b>below</b> and into the North Koreans' rear areas. The instability of the 24th Infantry made it necessary for Kean to order Throckmorton to send his only regimental reserve, E Company, north into the 24th Infantry sector along the Haman road to protect the right flank of the 5th Regimental Combat Team. In this position, E Company collected stragglers from the 24th Infantry every night and the next morning sent them back to their units. The US Navy then entered the battle {{in this part of the}} line, its destroyers standing off the south coast gave illumination at night by directing their searchlights against low-hanging clouds on Sobuk-san. One destroyer was on station almost continuously, supporting the ground action with the fire of six 5-inch guns. An artillery aerial observer directed this naval gunfire through the fire direction center.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{approximately}} 20 German infantry and armoured divisions {{trapped in the}} Falaise pocket around 12 were still operating {{with a degree of}} combat-effectiveness. As these formations retreated eastwards they fought desperately to keep the jaws of the encirclement—formed by the Canadians in Trun and St. Lambert, and the Poles and Americans in Chambois—from closing. German movement out of the pocket throughout the night of 19 August cut off the Polish battlegroups on the Mont Ormel ridge. On discovering this Stefanowicz conferred with Koszutski. Lacking sufficient means to either seal the pocket or fight their way clear, the two decided that the only chance of survival for their force was to hold fast until relieved. Although the Polish soldiers on Point 262N could hear movement from the <b>valley</b> <b>below,</b> other than some mortar rounds that landed among the positions of the 8th Infantry Battalion the night passed uneventfully. Without possession of Point 262S the Poles were unable to interfere with the large numbers of German troops slipping past the southern slopes of the ridge. The uneven, wooded terrain, interspersed with thick hedgerows, made control of the ground to the west and southwest difficult by day and impossible by night. As it grew light on 20 August Szydłowski prepared to fulfil his orders of the previous day and organised two companies of his 9th Infantry Battalion, supported by the 1st Armoured Regiment, for an attack across the road towards Point 262S. However, hampered by the wreckage littering the pass the attack soon bogged down in the face of fierce German resistance.|$|E
5|$|Perched {{high above}} the River Seine, an {{important}} transport route, the site of Château Gaillard, in the manor of Andeli, {{was identified as a}} naturally defensible position. In the <b>valley</b> <b>below</b> the site was the town of Grand Andely. Under the terms of the Treaty of Louviers (January 1196) between Richard and Philip II neither king was allowed to fortify the site; despite this, Richard intended to build a castle at Andeli. Its purpose was to protect the duchy of Normandy from Philip II—it helped fill a gap in the Norman defences left by the fall of Château de Gisors and above all Château de Gaillon, a castle which belonged to Philip and used as an advanced French fortification to block the Seine valley—and to act as a base from which Richard could launch his campaign to take back the Norman Vexin from French control. Indeed Les Andelys is located just in front of Gaillon {{on the other side of}} the Seine valley. Richard tried to obtain the manor through negotiation. Walter de Coutances, Archbishop of Rouen, was reluctant to sell the manor as it was one of the diocese's most profitable, and other lands belonging to the diocese had recently been damaged by war. When Philip besieged Aumale in northern Normandy, on the border with Picardy, Richard grew tired of waiting and seized the manor, although the act was opposed by the Church.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} source mentioning {{this specific}} site {{as a place}} of worship is from the 16th century. The previous sites used by Jews for mourning the destruction of the Temple, during periods when access to the city was prohibited to them, lay to the east, on the Mount of Olives and in the Kidron <b>Valley</b> <b>below</b> it. From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the Zionist movement in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence {{at the foot of the}} wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly riot in 1929 in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the Jewish quarter, and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the Six-Day War. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site the Moroccan Quarter was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.|$|E
