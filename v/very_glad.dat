5|$|Although Busoni {{met with}} many other artistic personalities who were also basing {{themselves}} in Switzerland during the war (including Stephan Zweig and James Joyce– the former noting Busoni's extensive drinking) he soon found his circumstances limiting. After {{the end of the}} war, he again undertook concert tours in England, Paris and Italy. In London he met with the composer Kaikhosru Sorabji who played to him his Second Piano Sonata (which he dedicated to Busoni); Busoni was sufficiently impressed to write for Sorabji a letter of recommendation. When Busoni's former pupil Leo Kestenberg, now an official at the Ministry of Culture in the German Weimar Republic, invited him to return to Germany, with the promise of a teaching post and productions of his operas, he was <b>very</b> <b>glad</b> to take the opportunity.|$|E

MGM's refusal to consider Wong for this most high-profile of Chinese characters in U.S. film is remembered today as [...] "one of the most notorious cases of casting discrimination in the 1930s".|$|E

500|$|In {{his late}} teens and early twenties, Murphy worked towards {{a career as}} a rock musician, playing guitar in several bands {{alongside}} his brother Páidi. The Beatles-obsessed pair named their most successful band [...] "The Sons of Mr. Greengenes", after a 1969 song by another idol, Frank Zappa. Murphy sang and played guitar in the band, which he has said [...] "specialised in wacky lyrics and endless guitar solos". In 1996, The Sons of Mr. Greengenes were offered a five-album record deal by Acid Jazz Records, but they did not sign the contract due to Murphy's brother still being in secondary school and the little money involved in ceding the rights to Murphy's compositions to the record label. Murphy confessed that [...] "I'm <b>very</b> <b>glad</b> in retrospect that we didn't sign because you kind of sign away your life to a label and the whole of your music".|$|E

With her neatly-set hair, comfortable, bustling manner, and brilliant smile, she has been dispensing homespun advice – and, of course, those celebrated hotpots – at the Rovers Return for more than a generation." [...] Commenting on her 30th anniversary with the show, Betty Driver said, [...] "It is just amazing that I've been here for 30 years. I suppose I have never really counted up the time I've been with the show, because I still enjoy it so much and am always looking forward rather than back.

500|$|In {{the postwar}} period, Shaw despaired of the British government's coercive {{policies}} towards Ireland, and joined his fellow-writers Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton in publicly condemning these actions. The Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921 {{led to the}} partition of Ireland between north and south, a provision that dismayed Shaw. In 1922 civil war {{broke out in the}} south between its pro-treaty and anti-treaty factions, the former of whom had established the Irish Free State. Shaw visited Dublin in August, and met Michael Collins, then head of the Free State's Provisional Government. Shaw was much impressed by Collins, and was saddened when, three days later, the Irish leader was ambushed and killed by anti-treaty forces. In a letter to Collins's sister, Shaw wrote: [...] "I met Michael for the first and last time on Saturday last, and am <b>very</b> <b>glad</b> I did. I rejoice in his memory, and will not be so disloyal to it as to snivel over his valiant death". Shaw remained a British subject all his life, but took dual British-Irish nationality in 1934.|$|E
500|$|Churchill {{first saw}} Chartwell in July 1921, {{shortly before the}} house and estate were to be auctioned. He {{returned}} the same month with his wife Clementine, who was initially attracted to the property, although her enthusiasm cooled during subsequent visits. In September 1922, when the house had failed to sell at auction, he was offered it for £5,500. He paid £5,000, after his first offer of £4,800, made because [...] "the house {{will have to be}} very largely rebuilt, and the presence of dry rot is a very serious adverse factor", was rejected. The seller was Captain Archibald John Campbell Colquhoun, who had inherited the house in June 1922 on the death of his brother. Campbell Colquhoun had been a contemporary of Churchill's at Harrow School in the 1880s. On completion of the sale in September 1922, Churchill wrote to him; [...] "I am <b>very</b> <b>glad</b> indeed to have become the possessor of [...] "Chartwell". I have been searching for two years for a home in the country and the site is the most beautiful and charming I have ever seen". The sale was concluded on 11 November 1922.|$|E

Harold, Prometesky, and Dermot had each carried one, in case of any disaster, that there might be three chances; but now they were all three laid in my lap--wonderful things, one a little larger than the others, but all curiously apple-like in form, such gifts as a bride has seldom had.|$|R
500|$|Jack Foley of IndieLondon {{rated the}} first episodes four stars out of five, stating that it [...] "made for {{exciting}} viewing {{even if the}} politics and the script sometimes proved laughably gung-ho and naive." [...] On review {{on the first two}} episodes, Jane Simon of The Mirror has said that between the cast, [...] "there's enough shock and awe to make you <b>very</b> <b>glad</b> they're showing this in a double bill." [...] Gerard Gilbert of The Arts Desk dubbed Strike Back as [...] "thin and lightweight next to [...] Spooks", and although [...] "not unexciting", Gilbert did not find the series interesting. Andrea Mullaney of The Scotsman was positive about the casting, and the changes in storyline from the original novel, though the series was aimed [...] "squarely at the blokey viewer who'd rather watch paint dry than a costume drama." [...] Whilst also reviewing Luther and Lewis, John Lloyd of The Financial Times called it [...] "fine for tension," [...] "good on sub-Bond dialogue" [...] and that the story lines make Spooks look true to life. Lloyd also called Richard Armitage [...] "one of the best action men on television." ...|$|E
500|$|Lane {{was born}} near Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, on July 15, 1864, {{the first of}} four {{children}} of Christopher Lane and the former Caroline Burns. [...] Christopher Lane was a preacher who owned a farm outside Charlottetown; when his voice began to fail, he became a dentist. The elder Lane, disliking the island colony's cold climate, moved with his family to Napa, California in 1871, and to Oakland in 1876, where Franklin graduated from Oakland High School. [...] Franklin Lane was hired to work in the printing office of the Oakland Times, then worked as a reporter, and in 1884 campaigned for the Prohibition Party. From 1884 to 1886, he attended the University of California at Berkeley, though he did not graduate. [...] Lane later wrote, [...] "I put myself through college by working on vacation and after hours, and I am <b>very</b> <b>glad</b> I did it." [...] He later received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from the University of California, from New York University, Brown University, and the University of North Carolina. [...] After leaving college, he worked as a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle. In 1889, he was admitted to the California Bar, having attended Hastings Law School.|$|E
500|$|Of the European shows, {{critical}} reaction was generally quite favorable. [...] The Irish Times said Springsteen showing {{no signs of}} age as he neared his 60th birthday, despite taking a spill during his stage antics in rainy Dublin, and remarked upon how [...] "a set that features so many songs about the toughness of life ... can be delivered with such extraordinary verve {{that by the time}} you leave, you’re <b>very</b> <b>glad</b> to be alive." [...] The Independent echoed the sentiment in reviewing the Hyde Park show, writing that he showed [...] "the vigour of a frontman a third of his age" [...] and that [...] "Springsteen's intensity was staggering from first powerful vocal to final thrashed-out chord." [...] The Bath Chronicle saluted Springsteen's performance at Glastonbury, saying [...] "As all the tickets were sold before Springsteen was even confirmed on the bill, he must have known he was facing something very rare for him – the musical equivalent of a sporting 'away match' where not everyone was necessarily a worshipper at the altar of Bruce." [...] They concluded that Springsteen gave [...] "a performance of passion, exuberance, exhilaration and musical majesty" [...] while sticking with his standard tour set list and not resorting to playing many of his better-known hits.|$|E
