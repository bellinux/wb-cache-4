40|$|In {{this paper}} we report our {{experiments}} and {{results for the}} brave new searching and hyperlinking tasks for the MediaEval Benchmark Initiative 2012. The searching task involves finding target <b>video</b> <b>segments</b> based on a short natural language sentence query and the hyperlinking task involves finding links from the target <b>video</b> <b>segments</b> to other related <b>video</b> <b>segments</b> in the collection using a set of anchor <b>segments</b> in the <b>videos</b> that correspond to the textual search queries. To find the starting points in the video, we only used speech transcripts and metadata as evidence source, however, other visual features (for e. g., faces, shots and keyframes) might also affect results for a query. We indexed speech transcripts and metadata, furthermore, the speech transcripts were indexed at speech segment level and at sentence level to improve the likelihood of finding jump-inpoints. For linking <b>video</b> <b>segments,</b> we computed k-nearest neighbours of <b>video</b> <b>segments</b> using euclidean distance. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} {{study was conducted}} to examine the learning experiences between groups of students that were taught with streaming <b>video</b> <b>segments</b> and those that were taught with text materials. Two second-grade classes were used as the intervention group and two second-grade classes were used as the non-intervention group. The intervention group received instruction using streaming <b>video</b> <b>segments</b> in whole group and independent work. The non-intervention group received the same content as the intervention group, but their information was provided through the use of teacher-created flipbooks. Both groups had the same tasks to complete after the lessons. Results of this study indicated students were interested in lessons with imbedded with <b>video</b> <b>segments</b> and showed improved achievement as a result. However, whether <b>video</b> <b>segments</b> can improve the problem-solving ability of young children remains unclear...|$|R

They make plans to go to Coney Island that day, and footage of their excursion is spliced all throughout the film. The footage then cuts to the evening of Friday, May 22, when Jason, Rob's brother, and his girlfriend, Lily, prepare a farewell party for Rob, who will be moving to Japan. Their friend Hud uses the camera to film testimonials during the party.|$|E
25|$|The border {{station at}} Holmec was the {{location}} of an alleged war crime perpetrated by Slovenian TO forces, filmed by the Austrian public broadcasting station ORF. Video footage shows {{a small group of}} YPA soldiers standing or walking slowly with raised hands, holding up a white sheet in an apparent attempt to surrender. Moments later, gunfire is heard and the soldiers fall or jump to the ground. Neither the origin of the gunfire nor its exact effect are clearly visible on the <b>video</b> <b>segment.</b> Slovene officials maintain that the YPA soldiers jumped for cover and were not hit, and that the matter was thoroughly investigated years ago. However, the incident sparked renewed public debate after the footage was shown on Serbian TV station B92 in 2006, with many claiming that the soldiers were shot and killed by Slovenian TO troops and that Slovenia is trying to cover up the affair.|$|E

In response, the Palestine Action Group pointed out earlier reports by the Australian acknowledging that Max Brenner is a brand of the Strauss Group. Harrison responded {{by pointing out that}} Max Brenner's Australian franchine operations are referenced in the Strauss Group's annual report, and argued that the Australian franchisees should hand back their licenses to Strauss to signal their opposition to Strauss's support for the Israeli occupation.|$|E

Grant, Ernest Angley, and Peter Popoff, whom Randi first exposed on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in February 1986. Hearing about his investigation of Popoff, Carson invited Randi onto his late-night TV show without seeing the evidence {{he was going to}} reveal. Carson appeared stunned after Randi showed a brief <b>video</b> <b>segment</b> from one of Popoff's broadcasts showing him calling out a woman in the audience, revealed personal information about her that he claimed came from God, and then performed a laying-on-of-hands healing to drive the devil from her body. Randi then replayed the video, but with some of the sound dubbed in that he and his investigating team captured during the event using a radio scanner and recorder. Their scanner had detected the radio frequency Popoff's wife Elizabeth was using backstage to broadcast directions and information to a miniature radio receiver hidden in Popoff's left ear. That information had been gathered by Popoff's assistants, who had handed out [...] "prayer cards" [...] to the audience before the show, instructing them to write down all the information Popoff would need to pray for them.|$|E
