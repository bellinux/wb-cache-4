5|$|Members of the Regiment faced {{discrimination}} {{during this}} period.

Soldiers of the Regiment faced discrimination in Marysville while <b>visiting</b> <b>from</b> neighboring Camp Beale, as the local businesses refused to serve Filipinos. This was later remedied by the Regiment's commander, who informed the Chamber of Commerce that they were failing {{to cooperate with the}} Army, at which point they changed their business practices. Further instances of discrimination against soldiers of the Regiment were also reported in Sacramento and San Francisco, where they were mistaken for Japanese Americans.|$|E
