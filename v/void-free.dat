Similar to masonry, walls built with gypsum blocks are massive, <b>void-free</b> and of high stability. Because no mortar, sand or plaster are used, the walls are (almost) built without water, like drywalls.

50|$|Oxidation and {{impurities}} in {{the metal}} films affect the diffusion reactions by reducing the diffusion rates. Therefore, clean deposition practices and bonding with oxide removal and re-oxidation prevention steps are applied. The oxide layer removal can be realized by various oxide etch chemistry methods. Dry etching processes, i.e. formic acid vapor cleaning, are preferred based on the minimization of the immersion in fluids and the resulting etching of the passivation or the adhesion layer. Using the CMP process, which is especially for Cu and Al required, creates a planarized surface with micro roughness around several nanometer and enables the achievement of <b>void-free</b> diffusion bonds. Further, a surface treatment for organic removal, e.g. UV-ozone exposure, is possible.|$|E

5000|$|Formally called [...] "encapsulation", potting {{consists}} of immersing the part or assembly in a liquid resin, then curing it. Potting {{can be done}} in a pre-molded potting shell, or directly in a mold. Today it is most widely used to protect semiconductor components from moisture and mechanical damage, and to serve as a mechanical structure holding the lead frame and the chip together. In earlier times it was often used to discourage reverse engineering of proprietary products built as printed circuit modules. It is also commonly used in high voltage products to allow live parts to be placed closer together, so that the product can be smaller. This also excludes dirt and conductive contaminants (such as impure water) from sensitive areas. Another use is to protect deep-submergence items such as sonar transducers from collapsing under extreme pressure, by filling all voids. Potting can be rigid or soft. When <b>void-free</b> potting is required, it is common practice to place the product in a vacuum chamber while the resin is still liquid, hold a vacuum for several minutes to draw the air out of internal cavities and the resin itself, then release the vacuum. Atmospheric pressure collapses the voids and forces the liquid resin into all internal spaces. Vacuum potting works best with resins that cure by polymerization, rather than solvent evaporation.|$|E

This study {{focuses on the}} development of an automated manufacturing system in order to free the operator from intervening in the analysis of the CAD model, planning the deposition path, and then manually setting the welding process parameters. Firstly, the relationship between single bead geometry and welding process parameters is established through an artificial neural network (ANN) model.

40|$|Organic-inorganic hybrid {{perovskite}} {{solar cells}} (PSCs) {{have reached a}} power conversion efficiency of 22. 1 % {{in a short period}} (∼ 7 years), which has been obtainable in silicon-based solar cells for decades. The high power conversion efficiency and simple fabrication process render perovskite solar cells as potential future power generators, after overcoming the lack of long-term stability, for which the deposition of <b>void-free</b> and pore-filled perovskite films on mesoporous TiO 2 layers is the key pursuit. In this research, we developed a sequential dip-spin coating method in which the perovskite solution can easily infiltrate the pores within the TiO 2 nanoparticulate layer, and the resultant film has large crystalline grains without voids between them. As a result, a higher short circuit current is achieved owing to the large interfacial area of TiO 2 /perovskite, along with enhanced power conversion efficiency, compared to the conventional spin coating method. The as-made pore-filled and <b>void-free</b> perovskite film avoids intrinsic moisture and air and can effectively protect the diffusion of degradation factors into the perovskite film, which is advantageous for the long-term stability of PSCs...|$|E

In the fabrication of fiber reinforced phenolic resin matrix composites, volatile management is crucial in producing <b>void-free</b> quality laminates. A commercial vacuum-bag moldable phenolic prepreg system was selected for this study. The traditional single-vacuum-bag (SVB) process was unable to manage the volatiles effectively, resulting in inferior voidy laminates.

The DVB process cure cycle (temperature /pressure profiles) for the selected composite system was designed, with the vacuum pressure application point carefully selected, to avoid excessive resin squeeze-outs and achieve the net shape and target resin content in the final consolidated laminate parts. Laminate consolidation quality was characterized by optical photomicrography for the cross sections and measurements of mechanical properties.

40|$|Wire-feed {{additive}} manufacturing technologies {{have made it}} possible to significantly reduce material waste and energy consumption for fabricating large aerospace metal components that feature high buy-to-fly ratios. This paper presents an innovative path planning strategy using medial axis transformation for the wire-feed {{additive manufacturing}} process. The proposed path planning strategy is able to improve geometrical accuracy and produce <b>void-free</b> deposition by continuously altering the deposition width of the wire-feed process to accommodate the component geometry, while simultaneously minimising the number of interruptions to the deposition process at the component boundary. As a result, both buy-to-fly ratio and energy consumption are improved through reducing material waste. The algorithm for generating the adaptive path is described and validated through application to various typical geometries. Buy-to-fly ratios are calculated for a number of thin-walled complex structures. Savings of more than 27 % in material usage are achieved using adaptive path planning, when compared with non-adaptive methods. The proposed method is tested experimentally through deposition of two metal components. The results demonstrate that the adaptive strategy is capable of generating <b>void-free</b> deposition with improved accuracy at the component boundary using the wire-feed additive manufacturing process...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} process for the <b>void-free</b> filling of sub- 100 nm {{trenches}} with copper or copper-manganese alloy by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Conformally deposited manganese nitride serves as an underlayer that initially chemisorbs iodine. CVD of copper or copper-manganese alloy releases the adsorbed iodine atoms {{from the surface of}} the manganese nitride, allowing iodine to act as a surfactant catalyst floating on the surface of the growing copper layer. The iodine increases the growth rate of the copper and manganese by an order of magnitude. As the iodine concentrates near the narrowing bottoms of features, <b>void-free,</b> bottom-up filling of CVD of pure copper or copper-manganese alloy is achieved in trenches narrower than 30 nm with aspect ratios up to at least 5 : 1. The manganese nitride films also show barrier properties against copper diffusion and enhance adhesion between copper and dielec-tric insulators. During post-deposition annealing, manganese in the alloy diffuses out from copper through the grain boundaries and forms a self-aligned layer that further improves adhesion and barrier properties at the copper/insulator interface. This process provides nanoscale interconnects for microelectronic devices with higher speeds and longer lifetimes...|$|E
