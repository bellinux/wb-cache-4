The size of the free volume elements declined initially, followed by an increasing trend at vapor partial pressures greater than 2. 5 kPa, indicating polymer swelling.

Films were prepared by casting with 3 % in weight of cassava starch, using glycerol as plasticizer (0. 30 g per g of starch), cellulose fibers at a concentration of 0. 30 g of fibers per g of starch and nanoclay (0. 05 g clay per g starch and 0. 10 g clay per g starch).

The temperature sensitive water <b>vapor</b> <b>permeability</b> at soft segment crystal melting point was observed for SMPU coated fabrics. When the experimental temperature reached the soft segment crystal temperature of SMPU, an abrupt change of water <b>vapor</b> <b>permeability</b> of SMPU coated fabrics were observed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{fabricated}} three-layer films, comprising a varying {{content of}} ethylene–vinyl alcohol copoly-mer (EVOH) as the internal layer and blends of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and low-density ethylene grafted with maleic anhydride (LDPE-g-MAH) as the external layers, by a coextrusion blown-film process. We {{chose to use}} blends to promote the adhesion between EVOH and LDPE and {{to reduce the number}} of layers in the coextrusion system. The peel strength increased sharply when the amount of LDPE-g-MAH was greater than 12. 5 wt % and we associate it with the promotion of adhesion between layers brought about by specific interactions between EVOH and LDPE-g-MAH. FT-IR spectroscopic analysis showed an increase in the intensity of the absorbance of the ester band upon increasing the content of LDPE-g-MAH, which indicates that a chemical reaction occurs that promotes adhesion at the interface. The tensile strength did not change significantly with increasing LDPE-g-MAH content, which had a small effect on elongation and modulus in both the machine direction (MD) and transverse direction (TD). Tear strength decreased continuously with in-creasing LDPE-g-MAH content, in both the MD and TD, as a result of the greater ease of crack propagation in the EVOH layer. The oxygen permeability of the three-layer films remained almost constant upon varying the amount of LDPE-g-MAH. These three-layer films all followed the theoretical prediction made by the inverse additivity rule. The water <b>vapor</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of the three-layer films, however, were affected by the degree of hydrogen bonding, which was analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Wide {{usage of}} {{cellular}} foam as low temperature {{thermal insulating material}} warrants good understanding of its thermal and water vapor transmission behavior. An attempt {{has been made to}} experimentally observe the effect of cell shape on heat and mass transfer characteristics of cellular foams. The foam samples used in this study were derived from elastomeric foam The thermal conductivity and water vapor transmission data were taken on foams with three different cell shapes. one having spherical cells and two having elliptical cells, with varied degree of elon-gation. The thermal conductivity measurements on the samples described above were ob-tained using Thin-Heater thermal conductivity apparatus, otherwise known as the ASTM C- 1114 test. The thermal measurements were performed in the temperature range of 35 to 153 &deg;F. The experimental data indicated no significant effect of the cell elongation on thermal conductivity of foam. This could be attributed to the follow-ing: a) the densities of the foam were roughly the same, and therefore conduction heat transfer was not significantly changed; b) the possible decrease in the radiation component of thermal conductivity because of elongated cells was nullified by the increase in transmission of heat attributable to relatively thinner walls resulting from the stretching of the foams during sample preparation. Additionally, the change in the shape of cells could have changed the radiation heat transfer characteristic of the samples.
