5|$|HP sells a <b>virtualization</b> {{technology}} for Itanium called Integrity Virtual Machines.|$|E
5|$|According to Intel, it skips the 45nm process {{technology}} {{and uses a}} 32nm {{process technology}}. It features eight cores and has a 12-wide issue architecture, multithreading enhancements, and new instructions {{to take advantage of}} parallelism, especially in <b>virtualization.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since release 1.8 DragonFly has a <b>virtualization</b> {{mechanism}} {{similar to}} User-mode Linux, allowing a user to run another kernel in the userland. The virtual kernel (vkernel) is run in completely isolated environment with emulated network and storage interfaces, thus simplifying testing kernel subsystems and clustering features.|$|E
5|$|As with Windows 8, all {{certified}} devices must {{ship with}} UEFI Secure Boot enabled by default. Unlike Windows 8, OEMs {{are no longer}} required to make Secure Boot settings user-configurable, meaning that devices may optionally be locked to run only Microsoft-signed operating systems. A supported infrared-illuminated camera is required for Windows Hello face authentication. Device Guard requires a UEFI system with no third-party certificates loaded, and CPU <b>virtualization</b> extensions (including SLAT and IOMMU) enabled in firmware.|$|E
5|$|First {{introduced}} in FreeBSD version 4, jails is a security mechanism and an implementation of operating-system-level <b>virtualization</b> {{that enables the}} user to run multiple instances of a guest operating system {{on top of a}} FreeBSD host. It is an enhanced version of the traditional chroot mechanism. A process that runs within such a jail is unable to access the resources outside of it. Every jail has its own hostname and IP address. It is possible to run multiple jails at the same time, but the kernel is shared among all of them. Hence only software supported by the FreeBSD kernel can be run within a jail.|$|E
5|$|Main {{memory in}} a {{parallel}} computer is either shared memory (shared between all processing elements in a single address space), or distributed memory (in which each processing element has its own local address space). Distributed memory refers {{to the fact that}} the memory is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared memory and memory <b>virtualization</b> combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local memory and access to the memory on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory.|$|E
25|$|Hyp mode (ARMv7 <b>Virtualization</b> Extensions, ARMv8 EL2): A {{hypervisor}} {{mode that}} supports Popek and Goldberg <b>virtualization</b> {{requirements for the}} non-secure operation of the CPU.|$|E
25|$|Hardware {{supported}} <b>virtualization</b> technology.|$|E
25|$|SmartOS: <b>Virtualization</b> {{centered}} derivative from Joyent.|$|E
25|$|Computer <b>virtualization</b> {{refers to}} the {{abstraction}} of computer resources, such as the process of running two or more logical computer systems on one set of physical hardware. The concept originated with the IBM mainframe operating systems of the 1960s, but was commercialized for x86-compatible computers only in the 1990s. With <b>virtualization,</b> a system administrator could combine several physical systems into virtual machines on one single, powerful system, thereby unplugging the original hardware and reducing power and cooling consumption. <b>Virtualization</b> can assist in distributing work so that servers are either busy or put in a low-power sleep state. Several commercial companies and open-source projects now offer software packages to enable a transition to virtual computing. Intel Corporation and AMD have also built proprietary <b>virtualization</b> enhancements to the x86 instruction set into each of their CPU product lines, {{in order to facilitate}} virtual computing.|$|E
25|$|Parallels, Inc. is a {{developer}} of desktop and server <b>virtualization</b> software.|$|E
25|$|Open <b>Virtualization</b> and T6 {{are open}} source {{implementations}} of the trusted world architecture for TrustZone.|$|E
25|$|Parallels Desktop for Mac, by Parallels, is {{software}} providing hardware <b>virtualization</b> for Macintosh {{computers with}} Intel processors.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft Hyper-V, codenamed Viridian and {{formerly}} known as Windows Server <b>Virtualization,</b> is a native hypervisor; it can create virtual machines on x86-64 systems running Windows. Starting with Windows 8, Hyper-V superseded Windows Virtual PC as the hardware <b>virtualization</b> component of the client editions of Windows NT. A server computer running Hyper-V can be configured to expose individual virtual machines {{to one or more}} networks.|$|E
25|$|Remote Desktop <b>Virtualization</b> Host: Enables {{users to}} connect to virtual {{desktops}} by using RemoteApp and Desktop Connection.|$|E
25|$|The VT-X x86 <b>virtualization</b> {{feature is}} used by the Hyper-V and not {{available}} for other solutions as long as Hyper-V is installed.|$|E
25|$|Optional: if the {{processor}} supports hardware-assisted <b>virtualization</b> technology such as AMD-V or Intel-VT, {{it will be}} used. Before March 19, 2010, such a processor was mandatory.|$|E
25|$|VMware {{offers a}} product similar to Parallels called Fusion, {{released}} August 2007. VMware's <b>virtualization</b> product also {{allows users to}} use installations of Windows XP and later under OS X.|$|E
25|$|Virtual PC {{additions}} for guest {{operating systems}} no longer supported have been removed. However, installing Virtual Machine Additions from an older Microsoft <b>virtualization</b> product works for some guest OSes.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, other {{application}} <b>virtualization</b> {{solutions and}} portable application creators, such as VMware ThinApp (for Windows) or RUNZ (for Linux) {{can be used}} to run software from a flash drive without installation.|$|E
25|$|Windows XP Mode (Professional, Ultimate and Enterprise): Requires an {{additional}} 1GB of RAM and additional 15GB of available hard disk space. The requirement for a processor capable of hardware <b>virtualization</b> has been lifted.|$|E
25|$|Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) {{provides}} web-based {{monitoring and}} management tools for Oracle products (and for some third-party software), including database management, middleware management, application management, hardware and <b>virtualization</b> management and cloud management.|$|E
25|$|Released on June 15, 2006, it was {{the first}} {{software}} product to bring <b>virtualization</b> mainstream to Macintosh computers utilizing the Appleâ€“Intel architecture (earlier software products ran PC software in an emulated environment).|$|E
25|$|In October 2015, AVST {{released}} CX-E 8.7. The release provided enhancements to Atom, the context-aware personal assistant, {{which included}} Microsoft Hyper-V support for <b>virtualization</b> and GENBAND EXPERiUS integration to enable {{migration to the}} cloud.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the release}} of Intel-based Macs, {{third-party}} platform <b>virtualization</b> software such as Parallels Desktop, VMware Fusion, and VirtualBox began to emerge. These programs allow users to run Microsoft Windows or previously Windows-only software on Macs at near native speed. Apple also released Boot Camp and Mac-specific Windows drivers that help users to install Windows XP or Vista and natively dual boot between Mac OS X and Windows. Though not condoned by Apple, {{it is possible to}} run the Linux operating system using Boot camp or other <b>virtualization</b> workarounds. Unlike most PCs, however, Macs are unable to run many legacy PC operating systems. In particular, Intel-based Macs lack the A20 gate.|$|E
25|$|ARMv7-A {{architecture}} optionally {{includes the}} divide instructions. The instructions {{might not be}} implemented, or implemented only in the Thumb instruction set, or implemented in both the Thumb and ARM instruction sets, or implemented if the <b>Virtualization</b> Extensions are included.|$|E
25|$|As with Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, in Windows Vista x64, old 16-bit Windows {{programs}} are not supported. If 16-bit software needs to be run in 64-bit Windows Vista, <b>virtualization</b> {{can be used for}} running a 32-bit operating system.|$|E
25|$|Qubes OS is a security-focused desktop {{operating}} system {{that aims to}} provide security through isolation. <b>Virtualization</b> is performed by Xen, and user environments can be based on Fedora, Debian, Whonix, and Microsoft Windows, among other {{operating system}}s.|$|E
25|$|Desktop <b>virtualization</b> (VDI) {{products}} from third-party companies (such as Quest Software vWorkspace, Citrix XenDesktop, Systancia AppliDis Fusion and Ericom PowerTerm WebConnect) provide {{the ability to}} host and centrally manage desktop virtual machines in the data center while giving end users a full PC desktop experience.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Virtualization</b> Host Extensions (VHE). These {{enhancements}} {{improve the}} performance of Type 2 hypervisors by reducing the software overhead associated when transitioning between the Host and Guest operating systems. The extensions allow the Host OS to execute at EL2, as opposed to EL1, without substantial modification.|$|E
25|$|In an OS, {{distributed}} and {{cloud computing}} context, templating refers {{to creating a}} single virtual machine image as a guest operating system, then saving it {{as a tool for}} multiple running virtual machines. The technique is used both in <b>virtualization</b> and cloud computing management, and is common in large server warehouses.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, IBM further {{abstracted}} {{the supervisor}} state from the hardware, {{resulting in a}} hypervisor that enabled full <b>virtualization,</b> i.e. the capacity to run multiple operating systems on the same machine totally independently from each other. Hence the first such system was called Virtual Machine or VM.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Getronics {{announced}} New VS (VSGX), {{a product}} designed to seamlessly run the VS operating system and all VS software on Intel 80x86 and IBM POWER machines under Linux or Unix, using a hardware abstraction layer. The product was a joint commercial effort of Getronics and TransVirtual Systems, developer of the Wang VS <b>virtualization</b> technology that makes the New VS possible. VS software can be run under New VS without program or data conversion. The New VS {{is a combination of}} very specifically configured mainstream PC or PowerPC server hardware running <b>virtualization</b> software. It is interoperable with SCSI-based Wang VS tape and disk drives, which provide a means of restoring VS files from standard backup tapes or copying VS disk drives. Wang networking and clustering are supported over TCP/IP.|$|E
25|$|In {{particular}} hardware abstraction {{does not}} involve abstracting the instruction set, which generally falls under the wider concept of portability. Abstracting the instruction set, when necessary (such as for handling the several revisions to the x86 instruction set, or emulating a missing math coprocessor), is performed by the kernel, or via hardware <b>virtualization.</b>|$|E
25|$|A Mobile Application Management {{platform}} that manages and secures app data through application <b>virtualization.</b> The BlackBerry Dynamics suite of apps includes email, calendar, contacts, tasks, instant messaging, browsing, and document sharing. The BlackBerry Dynamics SDK allows developers {{to utilize the}} platform's security, and add functionality from BlackBerry's other solutions into their applications.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} strategy, and {{the only}} sandbox strategy available in systems that {{do not meet the}} Popek and Goldberg <b>virtualization</b> requirements, is where the operating system is not running user programs as native code, but instead either emulates a processor or provides a host for a p-code based system such as Java.|$|E
