The ERL managed to accomplish this by devising a procedure for preparing Baratol in a form that was easy to cast. In March 1945, Kistiakowsky became part of the Cowpuncher Committee, so-called because it rode herd on the implosion effort.

50|$|In {{a nuclear}} weapon, {{an array of}} {{explosive}} lenses is used to change the several approximately-spherical diverging detonation waves into a single spherical converging one. The converging wave is then used to collapse the various shells (tamper, reflector, pusher, etc.) and finally compresses the core (pit) of fissionable material to a prompt critical state. They are usually machined from a plastic bonded explosive and an inert insert, called a wave-shaper, which is often a dense foam or plastic, though many other materials can be used. Other, mainly older explosive lenses do not include a wave shaper, but employ two explosive types that have significantly different <b>velocities</b> <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> (VoD), which {{are in the range}} from 5 to 9 km/s. The use of the low- and high-speed explosives again results in a spherical converging detonation wave to compress the physics package.

50|$|The {{introduction}} {{of water into}} an explosive is highly undesirable since it reduces the sensitivity, strength, and <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> of the explosive.

Sensitivity, strength, and <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> are reduced by inert materials that reduce the continuity of the explosive mass. When the moisture content evaporates during detonation, cooling occurs, which reduces the temperature of reaction.

40|$|Abstract. For {{nearly a}} century {{experimental}} measurements <b>of</b> the <b>velocities</b> <b>of</b> <b>detonations</b> in gases {{have been found in}} general agreement with those of the Chapman-Jouguet (C-J) hypothesis predicting velocities, relative to the burned gases, equal to the speed of sound in the burned gases. This was further supported by the Zeldovich- von Neumann- Döring (ZND) theories predicting Chapman-Jouguet velocities for detonations in which the shock and reaction zones are separated. However, for a very fast reaction, the shock and reaction regions overlap and the assumptions required for the C-J and ZND theories are no longer valid. Previous work with the direct simulation method established conditions for forcing the reaction and shock regions to coalesce in a detonation wave by means of a very fast exothermic reaction. The resulting detonation velocities were characterized as ultrafast, as they were found to exceed the steady-state velocities predicted by the C-J and ZND theories. Continued investigation into the ultrafast regime has allowed for the further development of this inconsistency with theory by including a heavy non-reacting gas in the mixture. The resulting gaseous mixtures closely followed the C-J predicted behavior for slow reactions, and for very fast reactions were found to produce ultrafast detonations with a substantially greater deviation from C-J behavior...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{outlines}} {{the past and}} contemporary efforts aim to achieve better understanding <b>of</b> the <b>detonation</b> phenomena in gases. In fact, {{the majority of these}} efforts are derived by the persisting demand to understand the detonation wave front, which requires a molecular scope in analyzing the phenomena. In addition, this chapter elucidates the physics of the Boltzmann equation and its connection with DSMC method in the context of non-equilibrium flows. The interest in investigating gaseous detonation come from its tremendous energy conversion rate and the potential of employing the phenomena in future hypersonic propulsion systems through pulse detonation engines. Another important motivation to use a molecular level methodology in simulating gaseous detonations is the lack of understanding of DDT (Deflagration to Detonation Transition). The detonation phenomenon was firstly observed as a "violent chemical reaction" with the discovery and use of explosives in the fifteenth century. In fact, the first explosive known to sustain detonation waves was the gold fulminate; introduced by Oswald Croll in 1608 (Bacon and Rees 2000). However, detonation was not defined and distinguished apart from other forms of combustion until the development of certain diagnostic tools which enabled the measurement <b>of</b> the <b>detonation</b> wave <b>velocity.</b> This was probably done by Abel in 1869 (Abel 1869). The first efforts resulted in defining the range <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> wave <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> several gaseous fuels and its dependency factors were revealed by Berthelot and Vieille between 1881 and 1883 (Berthelot and Vieille 1883). By {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, detonation as a mode of combustion was clearly distinguished from deflagration based on the propagation velocity. The chemical reaction in detonation waves was reasoned to be initiated by the adiabatic compression in the detonation front (Mallard and Chˆ atelier 1883) and (Dixon 1893). Detonation can be defined as a shock wave sustained by a chemical reaction. However, to get deeper understanding of the nature and physics <b>of</b> <b>detonation,</b> sophisticated explanation <b>of</b> its mechanism is mandatory to comprehend. The chemical reaction associated with detonation consumes the combustible material about 103 to 108 faster than in other forms of combustion (i. e. deflagration). The meaning of this ultra-high combustion speed can be appreciated if one compared the energy converted through detonation to a well know energy conversion reference. If a detonation process was initiated into a good solid explosive material, energy is converted at a rate of 1010 watts/square centimeters <b>of</b> its <b>detonation</b> front. A 2 meter square detonation waves gives energy more than the total electric generating capacity of the united states in 2006, which was 1. 075 × 1012 watts. This enormous energy conversion rate has motivated researchers since the early days of the twentieth century to investigate the various aspects <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> theory and application. Since the main property distinguishes detonation from other forms <b>of</b> combustion is <b>velocity,</b> researchers fundamentally were interested to calculate it. L. Chapman and E. Jouguet have formulated a theory to predict the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> one dimensional <b>detonation</b> waves between 1899 and 1905 (Becker 1922). In their work, Chapman and Jouguet treated the detonation front as a discontinuity plane across which the conservation waves of shock waves apply. In the CJ theory, the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> steady <b>detonation</b> is consistent with the conservation conditions. Once the detonation wave is known, and the equation of state of the reaction products is given, the conservation laws determine the final state behind the detonation front. This theory, however, totally disregards the features <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> structure because <b>of</b> the insinuation of the one dimensional, adiabatic flow assumptions. Basically, it yields the possible solution of the steady one dimensional conservation equations that links the equilibrium states of the upstream reactants and downstream products. In order to know the propagation mechanism <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> waves, a more detailed and generalized theory had to be introduced. ...|$|R

40|$|Flames {{propagating}} in obstacle-filled {{channels are}} known to achieve very high speeds of propagation that can approach {{the speed of sound}} of the burnt products. The present paper reports the results of a detailed schlieren photographic study of such high speed flames. The experiments were carried out in two rectangular channels of different cross-section equipped with arrays of periodically spaced obstacles. The mechanisms responsible for the high speed propagation are identified as those which cause intense turbulization of the flame. These include shock-flame interaction, Raleigh-Taylor instabilities in an accelerating flow and autoignition in large recirculating eddies in the wake of obstacles. The transition from defla-gration to detonation (DDT) in obstacle-filled channel as well as the structure and propagation mechanisms of quasi-detonations have also been studied. The results clearly identify the propagation mechanism of quasi-detonation to be one of autoignition by shock reflections.
