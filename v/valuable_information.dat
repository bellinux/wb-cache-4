Culavamsa mentions in detail the arrival and the conquest of the Sinhalese capital Yapahuwa by a minister named Aryacakravarti during the period 1277 to 1283. It also mentions that the minister carried away the Budha’s relic from the capital to Pandyan Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} temples within Phlan, each {{dedicated}} to different gods. Each temple can heal {{those who are}} wounded, poisoned, or afflicted, and can fully restore deceased comrades for a high price. The party can also visit the hiring hall and hire an experienced NPC adventurer to accompany the party.

5|$|Choe's diary {{accounts}} of his travels in China became widely {{printed in the}} 16th century in both Korea and Japan. Modern historians also refer to his written works, since his travel diary provides a unique outsider's perspective on Chinese culture in the 15th century and <b>valuable</b> <b>information</b> on China's cities and regional differences. The attitudes and opinions expressed in his writing represent in part the standpoints and views of the 15th century Confucian Korean literati, who viewed Chinese culture as compatible with and similar to their own. His description of cities, people, customs, cuisines, and maritime commerce along China's Grand Canal provides insight into the daily life of China and how it differed between northern and southern China during the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, {{detailing}} {{the plan of}} attack and command structure for the invasion. Hungary and Bulgaria were promised the Banat and Yugoslav Macedonia respectively and the Romanian army was asked not to take part, holding its position at the countries' border. Internal conflict in Hungary over the invasion plans between the army and Teleki led to the Prime Minister's suicide that same evening.

5|$|The Tube Alloys {{programme}} in Britain and Canada was {{the first}} nuclear weapons project. Due to the high costs, {{and the fact that}} Britain was fighting a war within bombing range of its enemies, Tube Alloys was ultimately subsumed into the Manhattan Project. Despite reaching an agreement with the United States to share nuclear weapons technology, and to refrain from using it against each other, or against other countries without mutual consent, the United States failed to provide complete details {{of the results of the}} Manhattan Project to the United Kingdom. The Soviet Union gained <b>valuable</b> <b>information</b> through its atomic spies, who had infiltrated both the British and American projects.|$|E
5|$|The epitomes of Aurelius Victor (De Caesaribus), Eutropius (Breviarium), Festus (Breviarium), and the {{anonymous}} {{author of the}} Epitome de Caesaribus offer compressed secular political and military histories of the period. Although not Christian, the epitomes paint a favorable image of Constantine, but omit reference to Constantine's religious policies. The Panegyrici Latini, a collection of panegyrics from the late third and early fourth centuries, provide <b>valuable</b> <b>information</b> on the politics and ideology of the tetrarchic period and the early life of Constantine.

Charters, which recorded royal grants of land to individuals and to religious houses, provide further information on Coenred's reign, as does the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, compiled in Wessex at the end of the 9th century. The Chronicles anonymous scribe appears to have incorporated much information recorded in earlier periods. Coenred is also mentioned in two 8th-century hagiographies, those of Saint Wilfrid and Saint Guthlac.|$|E
5|$|After {{most of the}} Colorado River basin {{became part}} of the U.S. in 1846, the bulk of the river's course was still the subject of myths and speculation. Several expeditions charted the Colorado in the mid-19thcentury – one of which, led by John Wesley Powell, was the first to run the rapids of the Grand Canyon. American explorers {{collected}} <b>valuable</b> <b>information</b> that was later used to develop the river for navigation and water supply. Large-scale settlement of the lower basin began in the mid- to late-19thcentury, with steamboats providing transportation from the Gulf of California to landings along the river that linked to wagon roads to the interior. Lesser numbers settled in the upper basin, which was the scene of major gold strikes in the 1860s and 1870s.|$|E
