50|$|Justice Douglas, concurring, {{argued that}} since Baird {{was engaged in}} speech while distributing <b>vaginal</b> <b>foam,</b> his arrest was {{prohibited}} by the First Amendment.|$|E
50|$|Justice White, {{joined by}} Justice Blackmun, {{did not join}} Brennan's opinion but concurred in the {{judgment}} on narrower grounds. White and Blackmun declined to reach {{the issue of whether}} Massachusetts could limit distribution of contraceptives only to married couples. They argued that Massachusetts had asserted an implausible health rationale for limiting distribution of <b>vaginal</b> <b>foam</b> to licensed pharmacists or physicians.|$|E
50|$|Chief Justice Burger dissented alone, {{arguing that}} there were no {{conclusive}} findings available to the Court on the health risks of <b>vaginal</b> <b>foam</b> since that issue had not been presented to the lower courts, and thus no basis for the Court's finding that the Massachusetts statute served no public health interest. Burger also held that the Massachusetts statute independently advanced the state's interest in ensuring couples receive informed medical advice on contraceptives.|$|E
50|$|Nonoxynols {{have been}} used as detergents, {{emulsifiers}} and wetting agents in cosmetics, including hair products, and defoaming agents. Only nonoxynol-9 with 9 repeating ethoxy groups, {{has been used as a}} spermaticide, for <b>vaginal</b> <b>foams</b> and creams, and on condoms.|$|R
5000|$|Nonoxynols {{also known}} as nonaethylene glycol or {{polyethylene}} glycol nonyl phenyl ether are mixtures of nonionic surfactants used as detergents, emulsifiers, wetting agents or defoaming agents. The most commonly discussed compound nonoxynol-9 is a spermicide, formulated primarily {{as a component of}} <b>vaginal</b> <b>foams</b> and creams. Nonoxynol was found to metabolize into free nonylphenol when administered to lab animals. [...] Arkopal-N60, with on average 6 ethylene glycol units is a related used surfactant.|$|R
40|$|Nonoxynol- 9 (N- 9) is {{the most}} common active {{ingredient}} of spermicides. Spermicides containing N- 9 are available in many forms, such as jelly, films, suppositories and foams. The two major problems reported on using N- 9 spermicide were high failure and high irritation rates which were the main causes of its withdrawing from markets and as we know local methods of contraception (condoms and vaginal suppositories) have high acceptability especial in short term use. We tried to modify N- 9 products in a new formula which is safe, and effective. The new preparation based on the addition of low concentrations of zinc acetate salt (Zn (OAC) 2) to N- 9 that reduce the irritation of mucous membranes on frequent use and increase the efficacy of N- 9. The new preparation made in the form of <b>vaginal</b> <b>foaming</b> suppository. Â  It was tested in-vitro and in-vivo. The in-vitro results show a significant increase in efficacy of the combination (Zn (OAC) 2 & N- 9) than N- 9 alone. Additionally, the in-vivo results indicated a significant decrease in failure and irritation rates in the combination than (N- 9 alone) market suppository.

50|$|The authors {{express their}} belief that {{a husband and wife}} should produce as many {{children}} as they can reasonably manage and deplore several reasons some give for avoiding parenthood. They counter with several reasons why parents should seek to have and raise children. They then give suggestions for contraception that they believe are appropriate for Christians (because they are not abortifacient). They recommend, in order of reliability, birth control pills, condoms, diaphragms, <b>vaginal</b> <b>foam,</b> the rhythm method, and coitus interruptus. They recommend against permanent methods, such as vasectomy and having tubes tied.|$|E
40|$|Vaginal {{condition}} {{is a primary}} or secondary infec-tion of the vagina involving Candida species with Candida albicans being a leading cause [1]. This disease condition could be exacerbated by {{a change in the}} normal vaginal ecology [2]. Some agents reported to increase the occurrence of Candida species in the vaginal microbiota include broad spectrum antibiotics, steroids, high dose of estrogen and contraceptives) [3], while conditions predisposing the vaginal conditions include diabetes mellitus, T-cell dys-function which could be congenital or acquired, and preg-nancy. Contraceptives are chemical substances used for birth control measures. Examples include oral contracepti-ves, intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCD) /copper T, injectable contraceptives (Dopoprovera and Noristerate), jellies, creams, <b>foams,</b> <b>vaginal</b> tablets and cervical caps [4].
