50|$|While {{gasoline}} {{internal combustion}} engines are {{much easier to}} start in cold weather than diesel engines, they can still have cold weather starting problems under extreme conditions. For years the solution was to park the car in heated areas. In {{some parts of the}} world the oil was actually drained and heated over night and returned to the engine for cold starts. In the early 1950s the gasoline Gasifier unit was developed, where, on cold weather starts, raw gasoline was diverted to the unit where part of the fuel was burned causing the other part to become a hot vapor sent directly to the intake <b>valve</b> <b>manifold.</b> This unit was quite popular until electric engine block heaters became standard on gasoline engines sold in cold climates.|$|E

40|$|A {{computational}} simulation {{and experimental}} {{work of the}} fluid flow through the pneumatic circuit used in a stretch blow moulding machine is presented in this paper. The computer code is built around a zero-dimensional thermodynamic model for the air blowing and recycling containers together with a non-linear time-variant deterministic model for the pneumatic three stations single acting <b>valve</b> <b>manifold,</b> which, in turn, is linked to a quasi-one-dimensional unsteady flow model for the interconnecting pipes. The flow through the pipes accounts for viscous friction, heat transfer, cross-sectional area variation, and entropy variation. Two different solving methods are applied: the method of characteristics and the Harten-Lax-Van Leer (HLL) Riemann first-order scheme. The numerical model allows prediction of the air blowing process and, more significantly, permits determination of the recycling rate at each operating cycle. A simplified experimental set-up of the industrial process was designed, and the pressure and temperature were adequately monitored. Predictions of the blowing process for various configurations proved {{to be in good}} agreement with the measured results.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a {{drug delivery system}} for chronic pain that can accommodate multidrug protocols. An element {{that is important to}} the function of the system is a customized silicon micromachined <b>valve</b> <b>manifold.</b> Each valve is piezoelectrically actuated and operates by pressing an elon-gated valve seat against a shared glass substrate. The dual-valve substrate has two inlets and one outlet; a piezoresistive pres-sure sensor is embedded in the Si structure near each of these three ports. The sensors, which permit closed-loop control and error monitoring of the flow rate, have a typical sensitivity of 698 ppm/kPa. The 1 × 1. 5 × 3 cm 3 manifold provides modu-lation and mixing capabilities. The manifold is integrated into a stainless steel housing with a total volume of 130 cm 3 and a reservoir volume of 40 cm 3. Two spring-loaded polyethylene reservoirs feed the <b>valve</b> <b>manifold</b> at pressures up to 0. 52 kPa/mL. Benchtop tests of bolus and continuous flow delivery demonstrate flow rates ranging from 2. 30 to 0. 51 mL/h. (Both larger and smaller rates can be achieved by adjusting the parameters of the manifold valves or reservoir springs.) Additional tests suggest that the system can compensate for changes in spinal fluid pressure and that pressure profiles can be used to detect catheter occlusions and disconnects.

40|$|Sample {{preparation}} {{is one of}} the most crucial processes for nucleic acids based disease diagnosis. Several steps are required for nucleic acids extraction, impurity washes, and DNA/RNA elution. Careful sample {{preparation is}} vital to the obtaining of reliable diagnosis, especially with low copies of pathogens and cells. This paper describes a low-cost, disposable lab cartridge for automatic sample preparation, which is capable of handling flexible sample volumes of 10 μl to 1 ml. This plastic cartridge contains all the necessary reagents for pathogen and cell lysis, DNA/RNA extraction, impurity washes, DNA/RNA elution and waste processing in a completely sealed cartridge. The entire sample preparation processes are automatically conducted within the cartridge on a desktop unit using a pneumatic fluid manipulation approach. Reagents transportation is achieved with a combination of push and pull forces (with compressed air and vacuum, respectively), which are connected to the pneumatic inlets at the bottom of the cartridge. These pneumatic forces are regulated by pinch <b>valve</b> <b>manifold</b> and two pneumatic syringe pumps within the desktop unit. The performance of this pneumatic reagent delivery method was examined. We have demonstrated the capability of the on-cartridge RNA extraction and cancer-specific gene amplification from 10 copies of MCF- 7 breast cancer cells.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of chlorinated {{volatile organic compounds}} (CVOCs) in the aquifer underlying a manufacturing facility prompted the initiation of an aggressive voluntary site wide soil and groundwater cleanup. Given {{a large number of}} potential source areas within the plant, delineation of CVOC impacts to the unsaturated zone was performed by the installation of an innovative soil vapor extraction system, rather than performing extensive soil sampling within the operating manufacturing facility. The system was designed with a pneumatically actuated <b>valve</b> <b>manifold</b> system to cycle the 120 extraction points which allowed for delineation of impacts, targeting hot spot source area removal, and overall contaminant reduction while remaining below regulatory discharge requirements, thereby eliminating the need for more costly air treatment. The innovative system design reduced equipment size by 80 % while improving system recovery by operating in the most productive range of the removal curve. The groundwater remediation system, consisting of 6 extraction wells and 7 injection wells, is capable of extracting up to 600 gallons per minute (gpm) of groundwater. Up to 200 gpm of the extracted groundwater is treated by shallow tray air strippers with subsequent discharge via NPDES permitted outfall and re-injection of up to 400 gpm of substrate augmented groundwater into the upgradient portion of the plume. The net loss from the NPDES discharge provides capture and treatment of offsite groundwater downgradient of the site. The groundwater remediation system operates as a closed loop bioreactor allowing downgradient microbial seed to be recycled into the up gradient heart of the plume to increase the rate and effectiveness of CVOC removal via reductive dechlorination. Operations have so far have removed over 900 pounds of CVOCs from the unsaturated zone and over 1500 pounds CVOCs from the groundwater within the treatment zone.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. M. E. thesis. August 2016. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: James Van de Ven. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 153 pages. The {{goal of this}} thesis {{is to develop a}} computationally inexpensive, accurate, and practical mathematical model of a hydraulic reed style check valve. While the modeling of disc style check valves is well represented in literature, reed valve modeling research has focused on applications in air compressors and internal combustion engines, where the working fluid has low density, viscosity, and bulk modulus. However, in a hydraulic system, the fluid – namely oil – is dense, viscous, and stiff, contributing additional physical effects that must be considered. Furthermore, the operating pressure in hydraulic systems is higher than in pneumatic systems, creating additional challenges from a structural perspective. In this thesis, a one degree of freedom hydraulic disc and reed style check valve model were developed using a hybrid analytical, computational, and experimental approach. The disc valve equation of motion was derived from Newton’s second law applied to the disc considering forces including pressure, spring reaction, and drag. Euler- Bernoulli beam theory was used to derive the reed valve equation of motion. In each case, the valve flow rate was modeled as quasi-steady orifice flow using an empirical discharge coefficient. A non-contact method of experimentally measuring check valve position during operation using a laser triangulation sensor (LTS) was developed. An acrylic viewing window was installed in the check <b>valve</b> <b>manifold</b> to allow optical access. To precisely measure position through air, acrylic, and oil, refraction of the laser light was accounted for using Snell’s law. Finally, the disc and reed valve models were validated {{in the context of a}} single cylinder hydraulic piston pump across a range of operating conditions. Pump delivery, which is a measure of volumetric efficiency, and check valve position were chosen as the validation metrics. Experimental results showed that both the disc and reed check valve model accurately predicted the timing of valve opening and closing. The disc valve model predicted pump delivery within 5 % of measured values for all cases while the reed valve model predicted pump delivery within 3 % of measured values for all cases...|$|E
