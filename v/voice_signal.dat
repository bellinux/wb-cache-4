It was extended south to Liss in 1933, and around this time Oakhanger Halt railway station was built as the main station for the Bordon Garrison, until the line's closure in 1969. RAF Oakhanger was built in 1954 {{for the use of}} experimental space communications, when it bounced a <b>voice</b> <b>signal</b> off the moon and received it back. The station was bought out by a private company in 2003 and is now privately run.|$|E
25|$|For audio communications, {{there is}} a common {{agreement}} about the BFO oscillator shift of 1.7kHz. A <b>voice</b> <b>signal</b> is sensitive to about 50Hz shift, with up to 100Hz still bearable. Some receivers use a carrier recovery system, which attempts to automatically lock on to the exact IF frequency. The carrier recovery doesn't solve the frequency shift. It gives better S/N ratio on the detector output.|$|E

Edison discovered that carbon grains, squeezed between two metal plates, had a variable electrical resistance that was related to the pressure. Thus, the grains could vary their resistance as the plates moved in response to sound waves, and reproduce sound with good fidelity, without the weak signals associated with electromagnetic transmitters.|$|E

2500|$|On 3 June 1929 {{the first}} two-way, radiophone {{communication}} {{took place over}} the skies of the Packard Proving Grounds in Utica, (now Shelby Township, Michigan). [...] Heretofore, gasoline powered aircraft caused too much electro-magnetic interference for the weak <b>voice</b> <b>signal</b> {{to be heard over}} the static. [...] Only a strong Morse code signal could be heard. [...] As diesel engines neither have spark plugs, nor spark plug wiring the EM static was greatly reduced and allowed voice communication to be used. The two-way ground to plane voice communication was witnessed by the U.S. Department of Commerce.|$|E

30|$|The mood {{recognition}} module {{is activated}} when the perception system detects musical signals. Audio signals transmitted through a microphone of a robot {{can be either}} musical <b>signals</b> or human <b>voice</b> <b>signals.</b> Thus, the audio signals need to be classified into music and voice, since the system is programmed to process <b>voice</b> <b>signals</b> in the speech emotion recognition module. For the classification of audio signals, we employ the standard method of voice activity detection based on the zero crossing rate (ZCR) and energy [25]. When the audio signals indicate relatively high values in both ZCR and energy, the signals are regarded as musical signals. Otherwise, the signals are categorized as <b>voice</b> <b>signals</b> and submitted to the speech processing module.|$|R

The heart of both the transmitter and the receiver is a microcomputer based on an 8 -bit microprocessor (Inte 1 8085).

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{consists}} of hardware implementation of fast ICA algorithms for mixed speech signals. During experiment we recorded the <b>voice</b> <b>signals</b> {{of three different}} people one by one {{with the help of}} a single mic. After mixing the incoming signals ICA was applied. The observed results were compared with the incoming <b>voice</b> <b>signals</b> in order to know accuracy of the algorithm. In a second experiment we designed an array of mic where different people were talking at the same time. After low pass filtering, amplification and A/D conversion data was recorded serially in a computer through a microcontroller. Again ICA was applied and results were observed by listening the voice through a headphone. The resultant <b>voice</b> <b>signals</b> were very clear...|$|R

50|$|Simple {{additive}} mixers use Kirchhoff's circuit laws to add {{the currents}} {{of two or more}} signals together, and this terminology ("mixer") is only used in the realm of audio electronics where audio mixers are used to add together audio <b>signals</b> such as <b>voice</b> <b>signals,</b> music signals, and sound effects.|$|R
5000|$|T-carrier was {{originally}} developed for voice applications. When <b>voice</b> <b>signals</b> are digitized for transmission via T-carrier, the data stream always includes ample 1 bits to maintain synchronization. (To help this, the μ-law algorithm for digitizing <b>voice</b> <b>signals</b> encodes silence {{as a continuous}} stream of 1 bits.) However, when used for the transmission of digital data, the conventional AMI line code may fail to have sufficient marks to permit recovery of the incoming clock, and synchronization is lost. This happens when {{there are too many}} consecutive zeros in the user data being transported.|$|R
5000|$|In {{circuit-switched}} networks, such as {{the public}} switched telephone network (PSTN), it is desirable to transmit multiple subscriber calls over the same transmission medium to effectively utilize the bandwidth of the medium. [...] TDM allows transmitting and receiving telephone switches to create channels (tributaries) within a transmission stream. A standard DS0 <b>voice</b> <b>signal</b> has a data bit rate of 64 kbit/s. A TDM circuit runs at a much higher signal bandwidth, permitting the bandwidth to be divided into time frames (time slots) for each <b>voice</b> <b>signal</b> which is multiplexed onto the line by the transmitter. If the TDM frame consists of n voice frames, the line bandwidth is n*64 kbit/s.|$|E
50|$|The {{implementation}} of voice encryption {{dates back to}} World War II when secure communication was paramount to the US armed forces. During that time, noise was simply added to a <b>voice</b> <b>signal</b> to prevent enemies from listening to the conversations. Noise was added by playing a record of noise in synch with the <b>voice</b> <b>signal</b> and when the <b>voice</b> <b>signal</b> reached the receiver, the noise signal was subtracted out, leaving the original <b>voice</b> <b>signal.</b> In order to subtract out the noise, the receiver need to have exactly the same noise signal and the noise records were only made in pairs; one for the transmitter {{and one for the}} receiver. Having only two copies of records made it impossible for the wrong receiver to decrypt the signal. To implement the system, the army contracted Bell Laboratories and they developed a system called SIGSALY. With SIGSALY, ten channels were used to sample the voice frequency spectrum from 250 Hz to 3 kHz and two channels were allocated to sample voice pitch and background hiss. In the time of SIGSALY, the transistor had not been developed and the digital sampling was done by circuits using the model 2051 Thyratron vacuum tube. Each SIGSALY terminal used 40 racks of equipment weighing 55 tons and filled a large room. This equipment included radio transmitters and receivers and large phonograph turntables. The voice was keyed to two 16-inch vinyl phonograph records that contained a Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) audio tone. The records were played on large precise turntables in synch with the voice transmission.|$|E

50|$|VOR {{stations}} are fairly short range: the signals are {{line of sight}} between transmitter and receiver and are useful for up to 200 miles. Each station broadcasts a VHF radio composite signal including the navigation signal, station's identifier and voice, if so equipped. The navigation signal allows the airborne receiving equipment to determine a bearing from the station to the aircraft (direction from the VOR station in relation to Magnetic North). The station's identifier is typically a three-letter string in Morse code. The <b>voice</b> <b>signal,</b> if used, is usually the station name, in-flight recorded advisories, or live flight service broadcasts. At some locations, this <b>voice</b> <b>signal</b> is a continuous recorded broadcast of Hazardous Inflight Weather Advisory Service or HIWAS.|$|E
