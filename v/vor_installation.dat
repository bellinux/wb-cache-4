50|$|A VORTAC is a {{navigational aid}} for {{aircraft}} pilots {{consisting of a}} co-located VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) beacon and a tactical air navigation system (TACAN) beacon. Both types of beacons provide pilots azimuth information, but the VOR system is generally used by civil aircraft and the TACAN system by military aircraft. However, the TACAN distance measuring equipment is also used for civil purposes because civil DME equipment is built to match the military DME specifications. Most <b>VOR</b> <b>installations</b> in the United States are VORTACs. The system was designed and developed by Cardion Corp. (RDT&E contract was awarded 28 December 1981).|$|R
