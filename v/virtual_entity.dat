40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} Base Object Models (BOM) as implemented in the University of Central Florida’s (UCF) Virtual Backlot (VB) project. A BOM is a SISO approved form of Reference FOM designed to enable reuse of HLA components. SISO’s BOM Study Group has proposed general BOM design guidelines and federate development methodologies by which reuse capabilities may be designed into an HLA compliant simulation. The VB project is a natural testbed for the BOM paradigm. The VB project applies reuse methods that have roots in the traditional entertainment industry in which physical entities are repeatedly reused. For example, the same physical backlot street may appear in many movies {{with a minimum of}} modification, giving the illusion of different locations (New York, Paris, Rome, etc). It is a goal for the VB that <b>virtual</b> <b>entities</b> be repeatedly reused. These models are specifically designed for a Mixed Reality environment in which a user encounters a physical environment enhanced by the addition of <b>virtual</b> <b>entities.</b> The current VB project is directed towards rapid population of a physical MOUT facility with <b>virtual</b> <b>entities.</b> Ideally, the VB will provide a menu of readily reconfigurable <b>virtual</b> <b>entities</b> for MOUT scenario designers to work with. This paper will discuss aspects of the BOM philosophy that were able to be implemented in the VB as well as areas where the VB diverges from the BOM philosophy. Lessons learned and suggestions for future use are reported. 1...|$|R

5000|$|... where I is {{the total}} current flowing through the tip/sample nanojunction, J is the current density and Aeff is the {{effective}} emission area though which electrons can flow (from now on we will refer to it just as effective area). The most common mistake in CAFM research is {{to assume that the}} effective emission area (Aeff) equals the physical contact area (Ac). Strictly, this assumption is erroneous because in many different tip/sample systems the electrical field applied may propagate laterally. For example, when the CAFM tip is placed on a metal the lateral conductivity of the sample is very high, making (in principle) the whole sample surface area electrically connected (Aeff equals the area covered by the metallic film/electrode). Aeff has been defined as:"the sum of all those infinitesimal spatial locations {{on the surface of the}} sample that are electrically connected to the CAFM tip (the potential difference is negligible). As such, Aeff is a <b>virtual</b> <b>entity</b> that summarizes all electrically relevant effects within the tip/sample contact system into a single value, over which the current density is assumed to be constant." [...] Therefore, when the CAFM tip is placed in contact with a metal (a metallic sample or just a metallic pad on an insulator), the lateral conductivity of the metal is very high, and the CAFM tip can be understood as a current collector (nanosized probestation); on the contrary, if the CAFM tip is placed directly on an insulator, it acts as a nanosized electrode and provides a very high lateral resolution. The value of Aeff when a Pt-Ir coated tip (with a typical radius of 20 nm) is placed on a SiO2 insulating film has been calculated to be typically 50 nm2. The value of Aeff can fluctuate depending on the environmental conditions, and it can range from 1 nm2 in ultra high vacuum (UHV) to 300 nm2 in very humid environments.|$|E
40|$|Artificial Intelligence {{has been}} applied to dynamic games for many years. The {{ultimate}} goal is creating responses in <b>virtual</b> <b>entities</b> that display human-like reasoning in the definition of their behaviors. However, <b>virtual</b> <b>entities</b> that can be mistaken for real persons are yet very far from being fully achieved. This paper presents an adaptive learning based methodology for the definition of players’ profiles, with the purpose of supporting decisions of <b>virtual</b> <b>entities.</b> The proposed methodology is based on reinforcement learning algorithms, which are responsible for choosing, along the time, with the gathering of experience, the most appropriate from a set of different learning approaches. These learning approaches have very distinct natures, from mathematical to artificial intelligence and data analysis methodologies, so that the methodology is prepared for very distinct situations. This way it is equipped with a variety of tools that individually can be useful for each encountered situation. The proposed methodology is tested firstly on two simpler computer versus human player games: the rock-paper-scissors game, and a penalty-shootout simulation. Finally, the methodology is applied to the definition of action profiles of electricity market players; players that compete in a dynamic game-wise environment, in which the main goal is the achievement of the highest possible profits in the market...|$|R

40|$|Computer {{games with}} complex virtual worlds, which are {{populated}} by artificial characters and creatures, {{are the most}} visible application of artificial intelligence techniques. In recent years game development has been fuelled by dramatic advances in computer graphics hardware which {{have led to a}} rise in the quality of real-time computer graphics and increased realism in computer games. As a result of these developments video games are gaining acceptance and cultural significance as a form of art and popular culture. An important factor for the attainment of realism in games is the artificially intelligent behaviour displayed by the <b>virtual</b> <b>entities</b> that populate the games' virtual worlds. It is our firm belief that to further improve the behaviour of <b>virtual</b> <b>entities,</b> game AI development will have to mirror the advances achieved in game graphics. A major contributing factor for these advancements has been the advent of programmable shaders for real-time graphics, which in turn has been significantly simplified by the introduction of higher level programming languages for the creation of shaders. This has demonstrated that a good system can be vastly improved by the addition of a programming language. This thesis presents a similar (syntactic) approach to the definition of the behaviour of <b>virtual</b> <b>entities</b> in computer games. We introduce the term behaviour definition language (BDL), describing a programming language for the definition of game entity behaviour. We specify the requirements for this type of programming language, which are applied to {{the development and implementation of}} several behaviour definition languages, culminating in the design of a new game-genre independent behaviour definition (scripting) language. This extension programming language includes several game AI techniques within a single unified system, allowing the use of different methods of behaviour definition. A subset of the language (itself a BDL) was implemented as a proof of concept of this design, providing a framework for the syntactic definition of the behaviour of <b>virtual</b> <b>entities</b> in computer games. ...|$|R
