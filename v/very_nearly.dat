5|$|Sequences of transits usually repeat every 243 years. After {{this period}} of time Venus and Earth have {{returned}} to <b>very</b> <b>nearly</b> the same point in their respective orbits. During the Earth's 243 sidereal orbital periods, which total 88,757.3 days, Venus completes 395 sidereal orbital periods of 224.701 days each, equal to 88,756.9 Earth days. This period of time corresponds to 152 synodic periods of Venus.|$|E
5|$|Chickenpox was {{commonly}} {{confused with}} smallpox {{in the immediate}} post-eradication era. Chickenpox and smallpox can be distinguished by several methods. Unlike smallpox, chickenpox does not usually affect the palms and soles. Additionally, chickenpox pustules are of varying size due to variations in the timing of pustule eruption: smallpox pustules are all <b>very</b> <b>nearly</b> the same size since the viral effect progresses more uniformly. A variety of laboratory methods are available for detecting chickenpox in evaluation of suspected smallpox cases.|$|E
5|$|Climate models use {{quantitative}} methods {{to simulate the}} interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface and ice. They are used {{for a variety of}} purposes; from the study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system, to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or <b>very</b> <b>nearly</b> balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.|$|E

5|$|George's {{arrangement}} remained current until 1996, when Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published an}} arrangement informed by a cladistic analysis of morphological characteristics. They retained George's subgenera {{and many of}} his series, but discarded his sections. Banksia ser. Abietinae was found to be <b>very</b> <b>nearly</b> monophyletic, and so retained. It further resolved into four subclades, so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four subseries. Banksia sphaerocarpa appeared in the second of these, initially called the ' grossa clade' for its most basal member. As with George's classification, B.grossa and B.micrantha emerged as close relatives of B.sphaerocarpa.|$|E
5|$|On the average, {{space is}} {{observed}} to be <b>very</b> <b>nearly</b> flat (close to zero curvature), meaning that Euclidean geometry is empirically true with high accuracy {{throughout most of}} the Universe. Spacetime also appears to have a simply connected topology, in analogy with a sphere, at least on the length-scale of the observable Universe. However, present observations cannot exclude the possibilities that the Universe has more dimensions and that its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology, in analogy with the cylindrical or toroidal topologies of two-dimensional spaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{individual}} apparent magnitudes {{of the two}} component stars {{cannot be}} directly measured, but their relative brightness has been measured at various wavelengths. They have <b>very</b> <b>nearly</b> equal brightness in the visible light spectrum, with the hotter secondary component generally being {{found to be a}} few tenths of a magnitude brighter. A 2016 measurement gives the magnitude difference between the two stars at a wavelength of 700 nm as 0.00 ± 0.1.|$|E

5|$|The species inhabits a {{strip of}} 25 {{equatorial}} African countries, <b>very</b> <b>nearly</b> ranging from the east to west coasts of the continent. The exact boundaries of this strip are not clearly defined, as the species' territory overlaps with that of other baboon species. In many places, this has resulted in cross-breeding between species. For example, considerable hybridization has occurred between the olive baboon and the hamadryas baboon in Ethiopia. Cross-breeding with the yellow baboon and the Guinea baboon has also been observed. Although this has been noted, the hybrids have not as yet been well studied.|$|E
5|$|When {{presented}} {{with evidence of}} Benedict Arnold's activities, it is reported that Washington remained calm. He did, however, investigate its extent, and suggested {{that he was willing}} to exchange André for Arnold during negotiations with General Clinton over the fate of Major André. Clinton refused this suggestion; after a military tribunal, André was hanged at Tappan, New York on October 2. Washington also infiltrated men into New York in an attempt to capture Arnold. This plan <b>very</b> <b>nearly</b> succeeded, but failed when Arnold changed living quarters prior to sailing for Virginia in December.|$|E

His Rockets won back-to-back championships against the New York Knicks (avenging his college championship loss to Patrick Ewing), and Shaquille O'Neal's Orlando Magic. In 1996, Olajuwon {{was a member of}} the Olympic gold-medal-winning United States national team, and was selected as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. He ended his career as the league's all-time leader in blocks (3,830) and is one of four NBA players to record a quadruple-double.|$|E

5|$|Kościuszko {{subsequently}} helped fortify the American {{bases in}} North Carolina, before {{taking part in}} several smaller operations in {{the final year of}} hostilities, harassing British foraging parties near Charleston, South Carolina. He had become engaged in these operations {{after the death of his}} friend Colonel John Laurens, taking over Laurens's intelligence network in the area. He commanded two cavalry squadrons and an infantry unit, and his last known battlefield command of the war occurred at James Island, South Carolina, on November 14, 1782. In what has been described as the Continental Army's final armed action of the war, he was <b>very</b> <b>nearly</b> killed as his small force was routed. A month later, he was among the Continental troops that reoccupied Charleston following the British evacuation of the city. Kościuszko spent the rest of the war there, conducting a fireworks display on April 23, 1783, to celebrate the signing of the Treaty of Paris earlier that month.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{launched from}} Dartmouth, setting sail on 6 May 1592 after delays due to bad weather. The planned voyage to the West Indies {{was put on}} hold as supplies had already been depleted during the delay. Instead the fleet intended to head towards the Azores to intercept a Spanish treasure fleet or Portuguese carracks heading homeward from the East Indies. Initially Raleigh commanded, but on the following day, 7 May, the fleet was overtaken by Frobisher in the pinnace Disdain. Raleigh was given letters from the Queen ordering his immediate recall to England, and thus Frobisher took command. On 11 May a storm struck just off Cape Finisterre, scattering {{the majority of the}} fleet; three small ships were sunk and Garland <b>very</b> <b>nearly</b> foundered.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{extended}} his lead to 13 seconds when Hamilton lost time due to struggling {{to pass the}} lapped cars of Senna and Glock. Glock attempted to pass Senna around the outside heading into the first corner {{but was unable to}} move ahead. On lap 37, Glock again attempted to overtake Senna but the two cars collided. The incident caused a puncture on Glock's car that <b>very</b> <b>nearly</b> threw him into the wall and forced him to make a pit stop, though his crew were not ready for him and he lost several seconds as the tyres were brought out. Senna remained on the circuit with a damaged front wing, and made a pit stop on the next lap. Sutil overtook Buemi for seventh place on lap 40. Hamilton was eight tenths of a second quicker than race leader Vettel on the same lap and reduced the gap to 11.9 seconds. Hülkenberg's car emitted blue smoke from the rear on the next lap but disappeared on the 42nd lap. It was announced two laps later that Button, Barrichello, Hülkenberg, Kubica, Petrov, Liuzzi, Sutil, Buemi and de la Rosa were under investigation for exceeding the speed limit during the safety car period.|$|E
