25|$|Forest fires: Like {{in other}} {{countries}} with very hot summers and seasonal drying of soils and vegetation, every year {{large areas of the}} Portuguese forest are destroyed. This has an important impact on the economy because many people and industries depend on forestry related activities. It is also a <b>very</b> <b>dramatic</b> ecological problem and a safety issue for the populations.|$|E

25|$|A few of {{the lost}} towns of Virginia have <b>very</b> <b>dramatic</b> stories, and, {{somewhat}} like the early settlers of Jamestown, the residents experienced much hardship. While natural factors doomed Jamestown, they also literally wiped out Boyd's Ferry, which was virtually entirely destroyed by flooding of the Dan River in Halifax County around 1800. That town was rebuilt across the river in a better location, and grew to become the Town of South Boston, which was even an incorporated independent city for over 25 years before the citizens decided to rejoin Halifax County as an incorporated town again in 1995.|$|E
25|$|The cast of Ploning {{is played}} by veteran actors as well as {{newcomers}} to show business. Veteran actress Judy Ann Santos got the title role. Compared to her other roles, which are <b>very</b> <b>dramatic</b> (particularly that of Mara in Mara Clara), her character in the film is seen as mellow and reserved. Numerous comediannes are also cast in the film, such as Gina Pareño (as Intang), Eugene Domingo (as Juaning), Ces Quesada (as Nieves), and Tessie Tomas (as Seling), whose dramatic performances seem weird in contrast to Santos'. The role of Celeste {{is supposed to have}} been given to Iza Calzado but Mylene Dizon took the role instead when scheduling conflicts between the film and Joaquin Bordado were not resolved. Other cast members include newcomers Lukas Agustin (as Siloy), Ogoy Agustin (as Veiling), Cedric Amit (as Digo), and Bodjong Fernandez (as Mou Sei) as well as established actors Ketchup Eusebio (as Badocdoc), Ronnie Lazaro (as Old Veiling), Jojit Lorenzo (as Basit), Tony Mabesa (as Susing), Spanky Manikan (as Tsuy), Crispin Piñeda (as Toting), Meryl Soriano (as Alma), Beth Tamayo (as Divina), and Joel Torre (as Mayor Siloy).|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} the outside world on the {{existence}} of indigenous peoples and their cultures is described as being <b>very</b> <b>dramatic.</b> In Siberia, only 10% of the tribal peoples live a nomadic or semi-nomadic life, compared to 70% 30 years ago. In Brazil – where Survival believes most of the world’s uncontacted tribes, probably more than 50, live – there are about 400 speakers for 110 languages. For authors such as Daniel Everett, this phenomenon represents a fundamental assault on the existence of peoples, as language expresses the way a group of people experience reality in a unique way, and it is a part of our common heritage. Ranka Bjeljac-Babic, lecturer and specialist in the psychology of language, describes an intrinsic and causal link between the threat of biological diversity and cultural diversity. The assault on indigenous customs and traditions is described {{as part of a larger}} assault on life, with its historical roots in colonization. Survival's report Progress can Kill highlights that the invasion of the Americas and Australia by Europeans eliminated 90% of the indigenous population on these continents. The threat of genocide continues.|$|E

25|$|Early spring can {{be quite}} cold, and {{occasionally}} the lowest temperatures of the year can occur in March, as it did at Heathrow Airport on 5 March 2001, 4 March 2006 and 8 March 2011. Temperatures below freezing are not unusual in March, even {{in the south of}} the UK. On the other hand, high temperatures above 30°C are generally rare but can occur on occasion; most recently on 25 May 2012. It was even hotter on 27 May 2005, when 31.9°C was recorded in London. Rarely, the hottest day of the year can be in spring. As stated below, 27 May was the hottest day of the year in 2012 {{in most parts of the}} UK. In Aberdaron, the hottest day of 2011 was very early on in the year on 21 April. Temperatures in March seldom reach 20°C, as they did in 1990, 1993, 2012 and 2017, and this temperature is usually reached for the first time in April or May. Throughout spring, there can be <b>very</b> <b>dramatic</b> temperature swings between day night. On 9 April 2017, night-time temperatures fell to just 3°C at Northolt, but 25°C was reached in the afternoon. Warmth in Spring depends almost entirely on the strength of the sun, and can trigger thunderstorms and downpours.|$|E

[...] "Led Zeppelin's music is <b>very</b> <b>dramatic</b> and very dynamic. [...] That's something we've attempted to do with our style also. I think it definitely affected how we make our music."

500|$|Fielding's plays do not prophesy that he {{will become}} a major novelist, but the {{direction}} of his theatrical career does suggest concerns that increasingly led him away from pure representation [...] Fielding's separation from the theatre was a forced one, but the expulsion was fortunate, freeing him from a relationship and commitment that had always been in some sense against the grain [...] Fielding's way is not really <b>very</b> <b>dramatic,</b> either in novels or in plays; he never developed stage-likely objective correlatives, having reserved his artistic energy for the examining process in which the action is rerun again and again, reviewed, considered, nearly masticated.|$|E

At 11 pm, Juan Perón stepped onto the balcony of the Casa Rosada and addressed the crowd. Biographer Robert D. Crassweller claims that this moment was very powerful because it was <b>very</b> <b>dramatic</b> and recalled many important aspects of Argentine history. Crassweller writes that Juan Perón enacted the role of a caudillo addressing his people in the tradition of Argentine leaders Rosas and Yrigoyen. Crassweller also claims that the evening contained [...] "mystic overtones" [...] of a [...] "quasi-religious" [...] nature.|$|E
500|$|Going {{into the}} fifth season of The X-Files, series creator Chris Carter noted, [...] "we {{knew we were}} going to be hitting these <b>very</b> <b>dramatic</b> marks which were the mythology episodes, and we wanted to lighten, or leaven, the season with quirky episodes." [...] Carter wanted to write a Frankenstein-inspired episode, but found it {{difficult}} to reconcile Mary Shelley's unbelievable tale with the style of the show. To achieve his vision, he wrote a script that blurred the real world with the X-Files reality and that had a distinct fantasy element. Carter combined elements of the original story with fairy tales and elements of folk tales. In order to make the episode [...] "as moving" [...] as possible, Carter sought to echo elements of James Whale's 1931 film version of Frankenstein. He later noted that, by [...] "using modern science, I took an old style, which is black and white, and an old approach, which is a kind of James Whale approach to science fiction, and came up with a story about a love-lorn monster".|$|E
500|$|The cast was {{receptive}} to the finale storyline. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, actor John Noble noted he liked how the story ultimately ended with having the two Walters [...] "perhaps negotiate a truce and put their minds together" [...] through a [...] "very inventive intervention by Peter, who basically took control of destiny and forced his two fathers to look {{each other in the}} eye, as if telling them: Sort it out, gentlemen.'" [...] He later noted, [...] "We finish [...] in a <b>very</b> <b>dramatic</b> place." [...] Joshua Jackson praised the role-reversal of his character with Walter's, [...] "You had Peter wracked with guilt over the circumstances tied to the decision he made [...] and clinging to hope that there might be some way out. I can’t have made a cosmically bad decision! There must be some way to put this right! Which is fascinating, because that’s basically been Walter for as long as we’ve known him. So I loved how Peter ceases to be so stubborn when it comes to Walter, comes to understand him and even begins to see things the way he does." ...|$|E

Another writer commented that in this [...] "grim opera" [...] the <b>very</b> intense <b>dramatic</b> effect of the music {{may be due to}} its generally low-key approach.|$|R
500|$|For {{the second}} season the show was {{nominated}} for five Teen Choice Awards winning four of them, including best drama. It was also nominated for the Favorite Television Drama People's Choice Award. Kelly Rowan won a PRISM Award for Performance in a Drama Series Episode, with Peter Gallagher also getting nominated. Additionally the season finale was nominated for the TV Drama Series Episode award. The introduction of bisexual character Alex, was praised as [...] "an especially charismatic new presence", with the show was praised for its handling of her lesbian relationship with Marissa. However Mischa Barton was criticized for her acting skills in portraying Marissa, alongside other noted flaws including [...] "flavorless plots," [...] and [...] "flat new characters who failed to grab the audience's interest". IGN faulted the move to quickly rekindle the Ryan and Marissa relationship and [...] "abruptly write off Alex and Lindsay, after [...] them a pretty {{big part of the}} show" [...] but commended a [...] "compelling story centering on Ryan's brother Trey coming to town, leading to a <b>very</b> <b>dramatic</b> season finale" [...] Tate Donovan, who played Jimmy, credited a drop in ratings to [...] "the show moving away from the family dynamic to focus more on the kids".|$|E
500|$|Both Ruby and Brax decide Charlie's {{ventilator}} {{should be}} turned off as {{there is nothing more}} the doctors can do for her and Charlie dies. Speaking about her character's exit storyline, Anderson said [...] "When I read the final script for Charlie's exit, I made sure I was in the privacy of my own home. It was written really well – it was a tragic love story and I hope the fans like it." [...] The actress explained that the storyline was great and the writers had done a brilliant job with Charlie and Brax. She also said some fans would be disappointed that the couple did not end up together. Anderson revealed that the series producer had told her that after investing so much in getting Charlie together with Brax, she would not have left the Bay for another reason and killing her off was the best way. Of her reaction to the storyline, Anderson said [...] "I started sobbing! But that was the initial shock. You play this character {{for three and a half}} years and you really empathise with them. You have to love a part of them – it's a little extension of you. So it's just so final, the death. But once I had time to let it sink in, now I'm really, really happy with the ending. It's <b>very</b> <b>dramatic</b> and it's definitely going out with a bang, so to speak!" [...] Anderson departed on screen on 24 January 2012.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Slant Magazine, Alexa Camp {{said the}} music video {{faithfully}} mirrored the song's lyrics and was understated by Del Rey's usual standards. Darwin who opined that the clip recalled Del Rey's short film Tropico (2013), deemed it [...] "a total cinematic gem," [...] and [...] "a gorgeous mashup of retro glamour and modern independence". The visual was also lauded by Complex writer Lauren Nostro who {{called it a}} [...] "stunning, cinematic" [...] and [...] "beautiful" [...] video, and Anna Moslein of Glamour who deemed it [...] "summer-perfect". Zumic's Bradley Bershad described the clip as [...] "a slightly bizarre, <b>very</b> <b>dramatic</b> trip through time and space" [...] and said its noir influences matched the track well, adding that its [...] "old school meets new school" [...] feel continued the musical persona Del Rey had crafted for herself. Bershad's view was shared by Smith who wrote, [...] "It pretty well marries together her continuing play with female sexuality, Hollywood stereotypes and insistence that she is her own creation". While DeGroot commended the video's black-and-white photography and flame imagery which he opined were less pretentious than that of [...] "Jeremy", which [...] "West Coast" [...] was compared to. Matthew Bramlett of TheWrap opined that Del Rey [...] "perfectly encapsulates her 'vintage California rich kid' look" [...] in the video and described the clip as [...] "very chic, with just a twinge of the old Hollywood flair" [...] the singer had embraced in her previous visuals. In a mixed review, Patrick D. McDermott of The Fader called the visual [...] "classic, kind of sad [...] in romantic black and white", but felt it was confusing and [...] "on-brand...a meticulous homage to nothing in particular". While Nelson wrote that the clip failed to enhance the song, but was understated enough not to detract from the music.|$|E
