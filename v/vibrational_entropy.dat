The vibrational entropies of formation span a wide range from - 0. 64 to + 0. 55 kB/atom, and the vibrational entropies of alloying ranged from - 0. 39 to + 1. 0 kB/atom. This range exceeds the range of configurational entropy of a binary alloy, which reaches a maximum value of + 0. 69 kB/atom and a minimum value of 0 k B /atom. The <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of the NiTi martensitic transition was measured using low-temperature calorimetry and inelastic neutron-scattering. The high-temperature B 2 phase of NiTi has a <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> 0. 5 k B /atom larger than the low-temperature martensitic phase. The difference in <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> accounts for the total entropy of the austenitic-martensitic phase transition. Inelastic neutron scattering was used to show that the phonon DOS of V is unchanged between 20 and 1000 °C, inconsistent with the phonon softening expected from thermal expansion.

The metals and alloy that have been studied are U, Ce, and Pd 3 V. Time-of-flight (TOF) inelastic neutron scattering spectra were measured on the three crystalline phases of uranium at temperatures from 50 K to 1213 K. Phonon density of states (DOS) curves were obtained from these spectra. For the α-phase, a large decrease in phonon energies with increasing temperature was observed over the entire temperature range. Analysis of the vibrational power spectrum showed that the phonon softening originates with continuous softening of a harmonic solid, as opposed to vibrations in anharmonic potentials.

However, how a single amino acid substitution in the antigen bonded to HLA affects the response of T cells remains uncertain. Hence, we used molecular dynamics computations to analyze the molecular interactions between peptides, HLA and TCR. We compared immunologically reactive complexes with non-reactive and weakly reactive complexes. MD trajectories were produced to simulate the behavior of isolated components of the various p-HLA-TCR complexes. Analysis of the fluctuations showed that p-HLA binding barely restrains TCR motions, and mainly affects the CDR 3 loops. Conversely, inactive p-HLA complexes displayed significant drop in their dynamics when compared with its free versus ternary forms (p-HLA-TCR). In agreement, the free non-reactive p-HLA complexes showed a lower amount of salt bridges than the responsive ones. This resulted in differences between the electrostatic potentials of reactive and inactive p-HLA species and larger <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropies</b> in non-elicitor complexes.

We have applied this methodology to calculate configurational and vibrational contributions to the entropy of the Ni 3 Al alloy as functions of temperature. We found that the bond proportion effect reduces the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> at the order-disorder transition, while the size mismatch and the bond proportion effects combined do not change the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> at the transition. We also found that the volume increase at the order-disorder transition causes a <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> increase of 0. 08 kB/atom, which is significant when compared to the configurational entropy increase of 0. 27 kB/atom. Our calculations indicate that the inclusion of vibrations reduces in about 30 percent the order-disorder transition temperature determined solely considering the configurational degrees of freedom.

40|$|Abstract. We have {{addressed}} two issues concerning the relative stabilities of various orientations of interstitial clusters in iron {{by making a}} comprehensive comparison between four recent empirical potentials. First, we have investigated the effect of finite temperature on the competition between clusters made of a few dumbbells oriented along 〈 111 〉 or 〈 110 〉. We show by quasi-harmonic calculations that 〈 111 〉 clusters have much larger <b>vibrational</b> formation <b>entropies</b> {{and that they are}} therefore stabilized with respect to 〈 110 〉 clusters at high temperature. Second, we have compared the formation energies of loops with several hundred atoms with Burgers vector 1 1 〈 111 〉 or 〈 100 〉. The 〈 111 〉 loops are found to be always more stable, but th...|$|R
40|$|The classic {{metallurgical}} systems – {{noble metal}} alloys – that have formed the benchmark for various alloy theories, are revisited. First-principles fully relaxed general potential LAPW total energies {{of a few}} ordered structures are used as input to a mixed-space cluster expansion calculation to study the phase stability, thermodynamic properties and bond lengths in Cu-Au, Ag-Au, Cu-Ag and Ni-Au alloys. (i) Our theoretical calculations correctly reproduce the tendencies of Ag-Au and Cu-Au to form compounds and Ni-Au and Cu-Ag to phase separate at T = 0 K. (ii) Of all possible structures, Cu 3 Au (L 12) and CuAu (L 10) {{are found to be}} the most stable low-temperature phases of Cu 1 −xAux with transition temperatures of 530 K and 660 K, respectively, compared to the experimental values 663 K and ≈ 670 K. The significant improvement over previous first-principles studies is attributed to the more accurate treatment of atomic relaxations in the present work. (iii) LAPW formation enthalpies demonstrate that L 12, the commonly assumed stable phase of CuAu 3, is not the ground state for Au-rich alloys, but rather that ordered 〈 100 〉 superlattices are stabilized. (iv) We extract the non-configurational (e. g., <b>vibrational)</b> <b>entropies</b> of formation and obtain large values for the size mismatched systems: 0. 48 kB/atom in Ni 0. 5 Au 0. 5 (T = 1100 K), 0. 37 kB/atom in Cu 0. 141 Ag 0. 859 (T = 1052 K), and 0. 16 kB/atom in Cu 0. 5 Au 0. 5 (T = 800 K). (v) Using 8 atom/cell special quasirandom structures we study the bond lengths in disordered Cu-Au and Ni-Au alloys and obtain good qualitative agreement with recent EXAFS measurements...|$|R
40|$|Recently, Ozawa and Berthier [J. Chem. Phys., 2017, 146, 014502] {{studied the}} configurational and <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropies</b> S_c and S_v from the {{relation}} S_tot=S_c+S_v for polydisperse mixtures of spheres. They noticed that because S_tot/N shall contain the mixing entropy per particle k_B s_m and S_v/N shall not, the configurational entropy per particle S_c/N shall diverge in the thermodynamic limit for continuous polydispersity {{due to the}} diverging s_m. They also provided a resolution for this paradox and related problems-it relies on a careful redefining of S_c and S_v. Here, we note that the relation S_tot=S_c+S_v is essentially a geometric relation in the phase space and shall hold without redefining S_c and S_v. We also note that the total entropy per particle S_tot/N diverges with N →∞ with continuous polydispersity as well. The usual way to avoid this and other difficulties with S_tot/N {{is to work with}} the excess entropy Δ S_tot (relative to the ideal gas of the same polydispersity). Speedy [Mol. Phys., 1998, 95, 169] applied this approach to the relation above and wrote this relation as Δ S_tot=S_c+Δ S_v. This form has flows as well, because S_v/N does not contain the k_B s_m term and the latter is introduced into Δ S_v/N instead. Here, we suggest that this relation shall actually be written as Δ S_tot=Δ_c S_c+Δ_v S_v, where Δ=Δ_c+Δ_v while Δ_c S_c=S_c-k_B N s_m and Δ_v S_v=S_v-k_B N[1 +(V/Λ^d N) +U/N k_B T] with Λ standing for the de Broglie wavelength. In this form, all the terms per particle are always finite for N →∞ and continuous when introducing a small polydispersity to a monodisperse system. We also suggest that the Adam-Gibbs and related relations shall in fact contain Δ_c S_c/N instead of S_c/N...|$|R
