5|$|Along {{with the}} blackmouth {{catshark}} (Galeus melastomus) and the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), the <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> {{is one of}} the most abundant deep-sea sharks in the northeastern Atlantic. It is found individually or in small shoals. Samplings in the Mediterranean have found females outnumbering males across all ages; this imbalance increases in the older age classes. In the Rockall Trough and the Catalan Sea, large adults are found in deeper waters than juveniles, which may serve to reduce competition between the two groups. However, this pattern has not been observed at other sites in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> is a robustly built shark with a {{moderately}} long, broad, flattened snout. The mouth has thin, smooth lips. The upper teeth are small, {{with a narrow}} central cusp and usually fewer than three pairs of lateral cusplets. The lower teeth are much larger, with a strongly slanted, blade-like cusp {{at the top and}} interlocking bases. The five pairs of gill slits are tiny, comparable in size to the spiracles. Both dorsal fins bear stout, grooved spines at the front, with the second much longer than the first and curved. The first dorsal fin originates behind the short and rounded pectoral fins; the second dorsal fin is twice the size of the first and originates behind the pelvic fins. The anal fin is absent. The tail is slender, leading to a long caudal fin with a small lower lobe and a low upper lobe with a prominent ventral notch near the tip.|$|E

5|$|Young <b>velvet</b> <b>bellies</b> feed {{mainly on}} krill and small bony fish, {{transitioning}} to squid and shrimp {{as they grow}} larger. There is evidence that individuals also move into deeper water as they age. This species exhibits a number of adaptations to living in the deep sea, such as specialized T-cells and liver proteins {{for dealing with the}} higher concentrations of heavy metals found there. <b>Velvet</b> <b>bellies</b> often carry a heavy parasite load. It is ovoviviparous, giving birth to litters of six to 20 young every two to three years. This species has virtually no commercial value, but large numbers are caught as bycatch in deepwater commercial fisheries. Although it has been assessed as of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the heavy fishing pressure throughout its range and its slow reproductive rate are raising conservation concerns.|$|R
5|$|Numerous {{parasite}}s {{are known}} for this species, and both juveniles and adults often carry heavy parasite loads. Known internal parasites include the monogenean Squalonchocotyle spinacis, the tapeworms Aporhynchus norvegicus, Lacistorhynchus tenuis, and Phyllobothrium squali, and the nematodes Anisakis simplex and Hysterothylacium aduncum. Some of these parasites use the <b>velvet</b> <b>belly's</b> prey as intermediate hosts and are acquired via ingestion, while others use the shark itself as an intermediate host. The barnacle Anelasma squalicola, an external parasite, attaches to the shark's dorsal spine socket and penetrates deeply into the muscle, in the process often providing an attachment site for a second (and rarely a third) barnacle. Infestation by this barnacle reduces its host's fecundity by impairing {{the development of the}} reproductive organs.|$|R
25|$|Large {{numbers of}} smooth lanternsharks, {{predominantly}} juvenile, are caught incidentally by commercial longline fisheries, {{and to a}} lesser extent in bottom trawls and fixed bottom nets, in the eastern Atlantic and off Japan. This species is one of the three most common sharks caught as bycatch in deepwater fisheries off southern Portugal, along with the <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> lanternshark (E. spinax) and the blackmouth catshark (Galeus melastomus). Most captured smooth lanternsharks are discarded, although some may be sold dried and salted for human consumption or processed into fishmeal. The smooth lanternshark's slow rates of reproduction and growth may render it vulnerable to population collapse under sustained fishing pressure. However, catch rates currently show no evidence of this occurring, which, coupled with the smooth lanternshark's wide geographic range, has led to the IUCN assessing it as of Least Concern.|$|E
500|$|The <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> lanternshark (or simply <b>velvet</b> <b>belly)</b> (Etmopterus spinax) is {{a species}} of dogfish shark in the family Etmopteridae. One {{of the most common}} {{deepwater}} sharks in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> is found from Iceland and Norway to Gabon and South Africa at a depth of [...] A small shark generally no more than [...] long, the <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> is so named because its black underside is abruptly distinct from the brown coloration on the rest of its body. The body of this species is fairly stout, with a moderately long snout and tail, and very small gill slits. Like other lanternsharks, the <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> is bioluminescent, with light-emitting photophores forming a species-specific pattern over its flanks and abdomen. The ventral photophores are thought to function in counter-illumination, which camouflages the shark against predators and prey. The bioluminescent flank markings {{may play a role in}} intraspecific communication.|$|E
500|$|As generalist predators, velvet bellies feed on {{crustaceans}} (e.g. pasiphaeid {{shrimp and}} krill), cephalopods (e.g. ommastrephid squid and sepiolids), and bony fishes (e.g. shads, barracudinas, lanternfishes, and pouts). Sharks off Italy also eat {{small amounts of}} nematodes, polychaete worms, and other cartilaginous fishes. Studies of velvet bellies off Norway and Portugal, and in the Rockall Trough, have found small sharks under [...] long feed mainly on the krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica and the small fish Maurolicus muelleri. As the sharks grow larger, their diets become more varied, consisting mainly of squid and the shrimp Pasiphaea tarda, as well fishes other than M. muelleri. It has been speculated that smaller velvet bellies may be too slow to catch fast-moving cephalopods. The cephalopod diet of adults overlaps {{with that of the}} Portuguese dogfish; the latter species may avoid competition with the <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> by living in deeper water. The bite force exerted by the <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> is only around 1 N.|$|E
500|$|The velvet belly's liver {{accounts}} for 17% {{of its body}} mass, three-quarters of which is oil, making it nearly neutrally buoyant. To deal with the higher concentrations of heavy metals in the deep sea, the <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> has T-cells in its bloodstream that can identify and mark toxic compounds for elimination. These T-cells are produced by a lymphomyeloid gland in its esophagus called a [...] "Leydig's organ", which {{is also found in}} some other sharks and rays. In its liver, specialized proteins are also capable of detoxifying cadmium, copper, mercury, zinc, and other toxic contaminants. The velvet belly's bioluminescence is thought to function in counter-illumination, which eliminates the shark's silhouette and camouflages it from upward-looking predators. Its bioluminescence may also serve a social function, such as finding mates or co-ordinating groups, as the pattern is species-specific. The <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> is an important food of larger fishes such as other sharks; a major predator of this species is the longnosed skate (Dipturus oxyrinchus).|$|E
500|$|The <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> was {{originally}} described as Squalus spinax by Swedish natural historian Carl Linnaeus, {{known as the}} [...] "father of taxonomy", in the 1758 tenth edition of Systema Naturae.

This species was later moved to the genus Etmopterus via the synonymy of Constantine Samuel Rafinesque's Etmopterus aculeatus with Squalus spinax.|$|E
500|$|The {{growth rate}} of the <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> is slow, though faster than some other deep-sea sharks, such as the leafscale gulper shark (Centrophorus squamosus) or the shortspine spurdog (Squalus mitsukurii). Males mature sexually at [...] long and females at [...] long. The average age at {{maturity}} is 4.0 years for males and 4.7 years for females, though four-year-old mature individuals of both sexes have {{been caught in the}} wild, along with immature females over eight years old. Males and females eight and 11 years old, respectively, have been caught in the wild; the potential lifespan of this species has been estimated at 18 years for males and 22 years for females.|$|E
500|$|The {{range of}} the <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> is in the eastern Atlantic, {{extending}} from Iceland and Norway to Gabon, including the Mediterranean Sea, the Azores, the Canary Islands, and Cape Verde. It has also been reported off Cape Province, South Africa.

It is most common at a depth of , though in the Rockall Trough, it is only found at a depth of [...] This species has been reported from as shallow as , and as deep as [...]|$|E
500|$|The dermal denticles {{are thin}} with hooked tips, {{arranged}} without a regular pattern well-separated from one another. The coloration is brown above, abruptly transitioning to black below. There are thin black marks above {{and behind the}} pelvic fins, and along the caudal fin. The <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> possesses numerous photophores that emit a blue-green light visible from [...] away. Varying densities of photophores are arranged in nine patches on the shark's sides and belly, creating a pattern unique to this species: photophores are present along the lateral line, scattered beneath the head but excluding the mouth, evenly on the belly, and concentrated around the pectoral fins and beneath the caudal peduncle. The maximum reported length is , although few are longer than 45cm (18in). Females are larger than males.|$|E
500|$|Throughout their range, {{substantial}} {{quantities of}} velvet bellies are caught as bycatch in bottom trawls meant for shrimp and lobsters, and deepwater longlines meant for other fish. Lacking commercial value, these sharks {{are almost always}} discarded with extremely high mortality, though occasionally they are dried and salted or made into fishmeal. The IUCN has listed the <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> under Least Concern overall, as its population remains stable across much of its range, and it is afforded some protection in the Mediterranean from a 2005 ban on bottom trawling below [...] However, in the northeastern Atlantic it has been assessed as Near Threatened, as its numbers have declined by almost 20% from 1970 to 19982004. The slow reproductive rate of this species limits its capacity to recover from population depletion.|$|E
500|$|In the Mediterranean sea, the Portuguese dogfish {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{deepwater}} sharks along with the blackmouth catshark (Galeus melastomus) and the <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> lantern shark [...] (Etmopterus spinax), and the only shark abundant below a depth of [...] By inhabiting deeper water, Portuguese dogfish in the Mediterranean may reduce competition with the other two species. The smaller size of Mediterranean sharks relative to those from the rest of the world may be due to limited food availability and/or the warmer, saltier environment. Some 87% of the diet of Portuguese dogfish in the Mediterranean consists of cephalopods. Bony fishes are a secondary food source, while immature sharks favor the shrimp Acanthephyra eximia, the most common decapod crustacean in their environment. Unlike in other regions, Mediterranean sharks seldom scavenge.|$|E
500|$|The <b>velvet</b> <b>belly</b> is ovoviviparous, {{with the}} embryos {{hatching}} inside the uterus and being sustained by a yolk sac. The reproductive cycle may be {{two to three}} years long, with ovulation occurring in early autumn, fertilization in the summer (or possibly in the winter if females are capable of storing sperm), and parturition in late winter or early spring. The gestation period is under one year. The litter size is six to 20, with the number of young increasing with female size. At birth, the young measure [...] long. The shark's bioluminescence develops before birth; the yolk sac is fluorescent before any photophores have formed, suggesting the mother transfers luminescent materials to her offspring. The first luminous tissue appears when the embryo is [...] long, and the complete pattern is laid down by the time it is [...] long. At birth, the young shark is already capable of counter-illumination with 80% of its ventral surface luminescent.|$|E
