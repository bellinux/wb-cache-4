5|$|The <b>Vicar</b> of Bullhampton {{is set in}} a {{small town}} in Wiltshire. It {{develops}} three subplots, all connected with Frank Fenwick, the eponymous <b>vicar.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{was then}} {{commissioned}} {{to repair a}} chimney at a local brewery. While working on this, he met a local welder who also knew the <b>vicar</b> of Bolton (Richard Greville Norburn), who wanted some repairs made to Bolton parish church's weathervanes. The <b>vicar</b> drove a 1929Humber limousine and was impressed by Dibnah's AJS motorcycle; the two quickly became friends. The church was the tallest building in Bolton and once Dibnah had repaired the weathervane the <b>vicar</b> asked him to gild it. Dibnah appeared in the local newspaper and the publicity and his friendship with the <b>vicar</b> enabled him to gain more work from the local clergy.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Vicar</b> of Bullhampton is an 1870 {{novel by}} Anthony Trollope. It {{is made up}} of three intertwining subplots: the {{courtship}} of a young woman by two suitors; a feud between the titular Broad church <b>vicar</b> and a Low church nobleman, abetted by a Methodist minister; and the vicar's attempt to rehabilitate a young woman who has gone astray.|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} the <b>vicar</b> and his family heading to a picnic with Squire Thornhill, {{during the course of}} which the <b>vicar</b> notices Thornhill's {{interest}} in his daughter, Olivia. The <b>vicar</b> warns his family that Thornhill is a degenerate young man, but Olivia is seduced and elopes with Thornhill. Secretly, Thornhill arranges a fake marriage ceremony to capitalize on his sexual desires while avoiding the responsibility that would come with the union. Olivia learns the marriage was fake and that she has duped into a form of consensual prostitution with Thornhill, but escapes and returns home. Thornhill decides to take his revenge by having the <b>vicar</b> incarcerated for his debts. While in prison, the <b>vicar</b> learns that the marriage was in fact legitimate; Thornhill's uncle, Sir William, then forces his nephew to apologize to Olivia and fulfill his obligations.|$|E
5|$|The parish, most {{recently}} {{of a central}} church persuasion, and with a strong choral tradition, generally has separate Welsh and English language services. The <b>Vicar</b> (formally priest-in-charge) is currently the Reverend Andrew Loat, appointed in 2014, after an interregnum from 2008, following the retirement of the Reverend Timothy Morgan (2001–2008), the previous <b>vicar.</b> The Venerable Hywel Jones (<b>vicar</b> 1979–1992) had been cleric with pastoral care 2008–2014.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Vicars</b> Choral {{currently}} number twelve men, of whom {{three are}} choral scholars. Since 1348 the College of <b>Vicars</b> {{had its own}} accommodation in a quadrangle converted in the early 15th century to form <b>Vicar's</b> Close. The <b>Vicars</b> Choral generally perform with the choristers, except on Wednesdays, when they sing alone, allowing them to present a different repertoire, in particular plainsong.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vicars</b> {{general and}} episcopal <b>vicars</b> lose their powers sede vacante {{if they are}} not bishops; the <b>vicars</b> that are {{themselves}} bishops retain the powers they had before the see fell vacant, which they are to exercise under the authority of the administrator.|$|R
50|$|On 23 November 1912, the London Mail {{alleged that}} <b>Vicars</b> had allowed a woman {{reported}} to be his mistress to obtain a copy to {{the key to the}} safe and that she had fled to Paris with the jewels. In July 1913 <b>Vicars</b> sued the paper for libel; it admitted that the story was completely baseless and that the woman in question did not exist; <b>Vicars</b> was awarded damages of £5,000. <b>Vicars</b> left nothing in his will to his half-brother Pierce Charles de Lacy O'Mahony, on the grounds that Mahony had repudiated a promise to recompense <b>Vicars</b> for the loss of income caused by his resignation.|$|R
5|$|The philosopher Joseph Glanvill was <b>Vicar</b> of Frome from 1662 to 1666.|$|E
5|$|While {{holding the}} signoria of Florence, Robert of Naples (12771343) had {{the eastern part}} of the Bargello in Florence constructed, where he had his <b>vicar</b> the Count of Battifolle reside. Villani writes in 1316 that Robert's <b>vicar</b> oversaw the {{construction}} of a large part of the new palace, which would suggest Robert's <b>vicar</b> had a great amount of influence in the construction of the eastern addition of the Palazzo del Podestà, including its Magdalen Chapel.|$|E
5|$|After college, Wheelwright {{was ordained}} a deacon on 19 December 1619, and the {{following}} day was ordained a priest in the Anglican Church. On 8 November 1621 he married Mary Storre, the daughter of Thomas Storre, who was the <b>vicar</b> of Bilsby. In 1623, upon {{the death of his}} father-in-law, Wheelwright became the Bilsby <b>vicar</b> and held this position for ten years. His first wife died in 1629, and was buried in Bilsby on 18 May of that year. He soon thereafter married Mary Hutchinson, a daughter of Edward Hutchinson of Alford, and a sister of William Hutchinson, whose wife was Anne Hutchinson.|$|E
50|$|A {{post office}} called <b>Vicars</b> was in {{operation}} between 1904 and 1972. W. L. <b>Vicars,</b> an early postmster, gave the community his name.|$|R
50|$|On 23 November 1912, the Daily Mail {{published}} serious false {{allegations against}} <b>Vicars.</b> The {{substance of the}} article was that <b>Vicars</b> had allowed a woman reported to be his mistress to obtain a copy to {{the key to the}} safe and that she had fled to Paris with the jewels. In July 1913 <b>Vicars</b> successfully sued the paper for libel, who admitted that the story was completely baseless and that the woman in question did not exist. <b>Vicars</b> was awarded damages of £5,000.|$|R
50|$|Judicial <b>vicars</b> are {{to serve}} for a {{specific}} term of office and, unlike <b>vicars</b> general and episcopal <b>vicars,</b> do not cease from office when the diocese is without a bishop, either through the bishop’s death, resignation (having been accepted by the Roman Pontiff), transfer, or privation of office (having been made known to the bishop).|$|R
5|$|After {{considering}} the changed circumstances, the Archbishop of Goa, by a provision issued on 20 February 1795, appointed Minguel José Louis Mendes interim <b>vicar</b> {{of the four}} sub-districts of Mangalore, Barcoor, Onore and Moolki. Some other priests also came to Canara with the new <b>vicar.</b> Those from Goa retained their old prejudices and could not accept the rule of Tipu, openly advocating rebellion against him, writing offensive letters and making offensive speeches. As a result, in 1797, the brief repite enjoyed by the Christians ceased and their persecution recommenced.|$|E
5|$|Birkin becomes {{accepted}} into the Nonconformist family of Mr Ellerbeck the station master (Jim Carter), with whom he dines on Sundays; the hospitality of the chapel congregation is contrasted against the established church, which has consigned the penniless Birkin {{to sleep in the}} church belfry. Ellerbeck's children eventually persuade Birkin to preach a sermon at a nearby Methodist chapel. Birkin also forms an emotional, albeit unspoken, attachment to Alice Keach (Natasha Richardson), the young wife of the <b>vicar.</b> The <b>vicar</b> himself (Patrick Malahide) is portrayed unsympathetically as an obstruction to the work in the church, viewing the medieval painting as symptomatic of the superstition prevalent in the community.|$|E
5|$|In 1499, John de Combe, a precentor of Exeter Cathedral {{and former}} <b>vicar</b> of Crewkerne, founded Crewkerne Grammar School. The school survived until 1904.|$|E
50|$|Bookseller {{and author}} Hedley <b>Vicars</b> Storey {{was born in}} 1870 in Northamptonshire, England. His father admired Captain Hedley <b>Vicars,</b> who fought at Sebastopol, and named his son after the soldier.|$|R
50|$|Ralph founded <b>Vicars</b> Close.|$|R
50|$|From 1403, parish priests were {{appointed}} as <b>vicars,</b> rather than rectors, the rectory having been appropriated by the Dean of St Mary's College, Norwich, which had owned the benefice since about 1361. The following <b>vicars</b> are listed by Blomefield and Parkin.|$|R
5|$|Reginald Pinney {{was born}} in 1863 in Clifton, Bristol, the eldest son of the Reverend John Pinney, <b>vicar</b> of Coleshill, Warwickshire, and his wife, Harriet. His {{paternal}} grandfather was Charles Pinney, a prominent merchant and former mayor of Bristol, whilst his maternal grandfather, John Wingfield-Digby, was a previous <b>vicar</b> of Coleshill; an uncle, John Wingfield-Digby, would later be the Conservative MP for North Dorset. John and Harriet Pinney had five more children, four sons and a daughter, before Harriet's death in 1877. At least one of Reginald's brothers, John, also passed into the Army, joining the Central India Horse.|$|E
5|$|Several {{accounts}} about Murrell's {{activities have}} been preserved, {{either because they}} were reported on by the regional press or because they were passed down in oral tradition. One example focused around a rumour that had spread in nearby Canewdon which claimed that two prominent local women were malevolent witches. One of these individuals was Mary Ann Atkinson, {{the wife of the}} Reverend William Atkinson, the <b>vicar</b> of Canewdon. The other was Eliza Lodwick, a widow who took control of the 500 acre Lambourne Hall following the death of her husband in 1826; on two separate occasions labourers were convicted of stealing from her, while another died accidentally on her property. Locals concerned that these women were witches approached the <b>vicar</b> with their beliefs, but he dismissed them. They subsequently turned to Murrell, asking for his aid in exposing the women as witches. According to claims made in the 1950s by the-then 94-year-old local man Arthur Downes, the Canewdon villagers believed that Murrell could force all of the witches to assemble and dance about the churchyard against their will by whistling. However, the <b>vicar</b> intervened, with locals believing that he was doing so to protect his wife. The <b>vicar</b> himself died in March 1847.|$|E
5|$|Squire Thornhill {{leaves in}} a {{carriage}} with Olivia, whose departure is soon {{reported to the}} rest of the family. Stricken with grief, the <b>vicar</b> heads off to reclaim his wayward daughter. At the end of the marriage ceremony the farmer receives his payment, and the squire and Olivia embrace. The <b>vicar</b> arrives shortly afterwards, but after failing to persuade his daughter to return home with him leaves in despair. Olivia learns later that the marriage was a sham, but continues to live in Thornhill's house until he offers her as a prostitute to an acquaintance of his. Olivia flees in a rage and returns home, where she is reunited with her family. Thornhill, now out for revenge, has the <b>vicar</b> arrested and thrown into jail for unpaid debts.|$|E
50|$|Many of the <b>vicars</b> of St Andrew's Church {{have been}} {{appointed}} bishops after their ministry at St Andrew's. Since 1980, the <b>vicars</b> of St Andrew's have formerly been deans of cathedrals in dioceses in Tasmania, New South Wales and New Zealand.|$|R
40|$|In 1311, Henry VIII {{wants to}} control {{northern}} Italy appointing his <b>vicars</b> in the cities. Most {{of the imperial}} officials, however, are noblemen of the countryside and {{are not able to}} govern effectively. In particular, in Milan and nearby cities, <b>vicars</b> come from France and Savoy and are not related to the communal world. The poor quality of the <b>vicars</b> causes riots and desorders and leads to the crisis in the government of Henry in Lombardy...|$|R
5000|$|Further, all {{of those}} {{promoted}} to positions of authority (<b>vicars</b> general, judicial <b>vicars,</b> episcopal <b>vicars,</b> pastors of parishes and superiors within religious orders) or with teaching responsibilities (rectors of seminaries, professors at seminaries, heads or Catholic universities or professors on the faculties of Catholic colleges and universities who teach subjects involving religion), and all those ordained deacons (and therefore all those who will also later be ordained priests) to take the following [...] "Oath of Fidelity" ...|$|R
5|$|St Mary's {{continues}} to be active as an Anglican parish church. It is the most {{active member of the}} Cross Country Group of Parish Churches which comprises StMary's, StBartholomew's, Church Minshull, StOswald's, Worleston and StDavid's, Wettenhall. The churches share a <b>vicar</b> and three licensed readers. The <b>vicar</b> is RevdPeter Lillicrap. StMary's holds two or three services each Sunday and a service of Holy Communion each Wednesday. The group of churches is also involved with community activities including Praise & Play for pre-school children and their carers, the Holy Disorder youth club and the 1st Darnhall Guides and Brownies. The church is open for visits and private prayers on Wednesday mornings.|$|E
5|$|The Rev. John Richard Armitstead (1829–1919) {{was born}} at Springfields, Bradwall, and succeeded his father as <b>vicar</b> of St Mary's Church, Sandbach in October 1865.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Vicar</b> of Bullhampton was {{published}} serially in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine of Philadelphia in 1869–70. At the same time, an American book edition was issued by J. B. Lippincott & Co.|$|E
25|$|The Cathedral, built between 1235 and 1270, is an aisleless {{building}} of cruciform plan, having a central tower and terminating westwards {{in a massive}} residential castle. The Hall of the <b>Vicars</b> Choral {{was built in the}} 15th century. The <b>vicars</b> choral were laymen (sometimes minor canons) appointed to assist in chanting the cathedral services. At Cashel there were originally eight <b>vicars</b> choral with their own seal. This was later reduced to five honorary <b>vicars</b> choral who appointed singing-men as their deputies, a practice which continued until 1836. The restoration of the Hall was undertaken by the Office of Public Works as a project in connection with the European Architectural Heritage Year, 1975. Through it visitors now enter the site.|$|R
50|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{the style}} is given, by custom, to priests who hold {{positions}} of particular note: e.g. <b>vicars</b> general, episcopal <b>vicars,</b> judicial <b>vicars,</b> ecclesiastical judges, <b>vicars</b> forane (deans or archpriests), provincials of religious orders, rectors or presidents of cathedrals, seminaries or colleges/universities, priors of monasteries, canons, for instance. Monsignors of the grade of Papal chamberlain were formerly styled as The Very Reverend Monsignor, while domestic prelates and protonotaries apostolic were styled The Right Reverend Monsignor. Now, apart from legitimate custom or acquired right, most monsignors are simply styled The Reverend Monsignor. The title is also accorded in the Dominican Order to holders {{of the title}} of Master of Sacred Theology.|$|R
50|$|Incumbents include <b>vicars</b> and rectors.|$|R
