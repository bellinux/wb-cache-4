The very dark hair on its head fell to just below the shoulder-blades or even almost to the waist... Had it been standing, its arms would have reached to a little above its knees; they were therefore long, but its legs seemed to me rather short. I did not see its feet, but I did see some toes which were shaped in a <b>very</b> <b>normal</b> manner... There was nothing repulsive or ugly about its face, nor was it at all apelike.|$|E
500|$|Marina Lambrini Diamandis {{was born}} on 10 October 1985 in Brynmawr, {{and grew up in}} the nearby village of Pandy. She has one older sister. Her Welsh mother and Greek father met at Newcastle University and {{divorced}} when Diamandis was four. Following the divorce, her father returned to Greece but would occasionally visit, while Diamandis remained in a bungalow in Wales with her mother, where she shared a bedroom with her sister; she described her childhood as [...] "simple and idyllic" [...] and [...] "peaceful, <b>very</b> <b>normal,</b> poor".|$|E

Four Weddings and a Funeral director Mike Newell was approached but rejected it to work on Pushing Tin. He said that in commercial terms {{he had made the}} wrong decision, but did not regret it. The producer, Duncan Kenworthy, then turned to Roger Michell, saying that [...] "Finding someone as good as Roger, was just like finding the right actor to play each role. Roger shone out." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Lillian Faderman, [...] "There was {{probably}} no lesbian {{in the four}} decades between 1928 and the late 1960s capable of reading English {{or any of the}} eleven languages into which the book was translated who was unfamiliar with The Well of Loneliness." [...] Although the novel's author, Radclyffe Hall, intended it as an argument for greater tolerance for what she called [...] "sexual inverts", it has often been criticized by lesbian readers for its protagonist's self-hatred and its use of terms like [...] "freak" [...] and [...] "mistake of nature". Barney, as the salon hostess Valérie Seymour, appears in the novel as the symbol of a different attitude. [...] "Valérie, placid and self-assured, created an atmosphere of courage; everyone felt <b>very</b> <b>normal</b> and brave when they gathered together at Valérie Seymour's." ...|$|E
500|$|Johansson {{attended}} PS 41, {{an elementary}} school in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. Growing up, her family {{did not have much}} money. Her parents divorced when she was 13. Johansson was particularly close to her maternal grandmother, Dorothy Sloan, a bookkeeper and schoolteacher; they often spent time together and Johansson considered Sloan her best friend. Interested in a career in the spotlight from an early age, Johansson often put on song-and-dance routines for her family. She was particularly fond of musical theater and jazz hands. She took lessons in tap dance, and states that her parents were supportive of her career choice. Describing her childhood, she says it [...] "was filled with things that I loved to do, and also <b>very</b> <b>normal</b> things: I lived in New York, I have a family life and went to a regular school." ...|$|E
500|$|Brockett next {{introduces}} Stephen to Valérie Seymour, who– {{like her}} prototype, Natalie Clifford Barney– is the hostess {{of a literary}} salon, many of whose guests are lesbians and gay men. Immediately after this meeting Stephen announces she has decided to settle in Paris at 35 Rue Jacob (purchased at Seymour's recommendation), with its temple {{in a corner of}} an overgrown garden. Barney lived and held her salon at 20 Rue Jacob. Stephen is wary of Valérie, and does not visit her salon until after the war, when Brockett persuades her that Mary is becoming too isolated. She finds Valérie to be an [...] "indestructible creature" [...] capable of bestowing a sense of self-respect on others, at least temporarily: [...] "everyone felt <b>very</b> <b>normal</b> and brave when they gathered together at Valérie Seymour's". With Stephen's misgivings [...] "drugged", she and Mary are drawn further into the [...] "desolate country" [...] of Paris gay life. At Alec's Bar– the worst in a series of depressing nightspots– they encounter [...] "the battered remnants of men who...despised of the world, must despise themselves beyond all hope, it seemed, of salvation".|$|E

40|$|Although {{hundreds}} of papers have {{been devoted to}} the geometric and kinematic analysis of compressional tectonic regimes, surprisingly little {{has been written about}} the details of large-scale strain in extended areas. We attempt, by means of quantitative theoretical analysis guided by real geological examples, to establish some ground rules for interpreting extensional phenomena. We have found that large, <b>very</b> low-angle <b>normal</b> faults dominate highly extended terranes, and that both listric and planar normal faults are common components of their hanging walls. The <b>very</b> low-angle <b>normal</b> faults may have displacements from a few kilometres up to several tens of kilometres and we regard their hanging walls as extensional allochthons, analogous (but with opposite sense of movement) to thrust-fault allochthons. Differential tilt between imbricate fault blocks suggests listric geometry at depth, whereas uniformly tilted blocks are more likely to be bounded by planar faults. The tilt direction of imbricate normal-fault blocks within large extensional allochthons is commonly away from the transport direction of these sheets, but in many cases tilts are in the same direction as transport, thus limiting the usefulness of the direction of tilting as a transport indicator. The presence of chaos structure, a structural style widely recognised in the Basin and Range Province, implies large scale simple shear on <b>very</b> low-angle <b>normal</b> faults and does not necessarily form as a result of listric faulting...|$|R

500|$|... "Thank you, mister President-elect, for {{inviting}} me to your inauguration gala. I {{would like to take}} a moment from this very public ceremony to speak of something very personal. It concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and <b>very</b> <b>normal</b> young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E

After the original 39 scripts were exhausted, the series' lead actors, Gerard Cox and Sjoerd Pleijsier, took over writing, adding many new characters and references to Dutch history and popular culture.

[...] Describing her daily routine at this time, she said, [...] "I used to wake up at 5:30 in the morning to get ready for work and I didn't have time to put on make-up or do my hair... It was the type of job where I was alone most of the time so I didn't bother with it." [...] She wanted a different lifestyle, and to make more money, but she was unable to decide what sort of work she wanted to do.

60|$|He was one {{of those}} very natural-minded men with active imaginations who find women the most {{interesting}} things in a full and interesting universe. He was an entirely good man and almost professionally on the side of goodness, his pen was a pillar of the home and he was hostile and even actively hostile to all those influences that would undermine and change--anything; but he did find women attractive. He watched them and thought about them, he loved to be with them, he would take great pains to please and interest them, and his mind was frequently dreaming quite actively of them, of championing them, saying wonderful and impressive things to them, having great friendships with them, adoring them and being adored by them. At times he had to ride this interest on the curb. At times the vigour of its urgencies made him inconsistent and secretive.... Comparatively his own sex was a matter of indifference to him. Indeed he was a <b>very</b> <b>normal</b> man. Even such abstractions as Goodness and Justice had rich feminine figures in his mind, and when he sat down to write criticism at his desk, that pretty little slut of a Delphic Sibyl presided over his activities.|$|E
