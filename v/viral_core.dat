Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules cluster into a bulge in the cell membrane. The vRNA and <b>viral</b> <b>core</b> proteins leave the nucleus and enter this membrane protrusion (step 6). The mature virus buds off from the cell in a sphere of host phospholipid membrane, acquiring hemagglutinin and neuraminidase with this membrane coat (step 7). As before, the viruses adhere to the cell through hemagglutinin; the mature viruses detach once their neuraminidase has cleaved sialic acid residues from the host cell. After the release of new influenza virus, the host cell dies.|$|E

The viral genetic {{material}} is contained in double stranded linear DNA consisting of 202,182 tightly packed base pairs.

40|$|To better {{characterize}} {{the behavior of}} HIV- 1 capsids we developed EURT, for Entry/Uncoating assay based on core-packaged RNA availability and Translation. EURT is an alternative to Blam-Vpr, but as reporter RNA translation relies on core opening, {{it can be used}} to study viral capsids behavior. Our study reveals the existence of two major capsid species, a dead end one in which the viral genome is readily exposed to the cytoplasm and a functional one in which such exposure requires artificial core destabilization. Although reverse transcription drives a faster loss of susceptibility of <b>viral</b> <b>cores</b> to high doses of PF 74, it does not lead to higher exposure of the viral genome, implying that <b>viral</b> <b>cores</b> protect the genome irrespectively of reverse transcription. Lastly, IFNα drifts cores from functional to non-functional species, revealing a novel core-destabilizing activity. This assay sheds new light on the behavior of <b>viral</b> <b>cores</b> inside target cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{first step}} in {{influenza}} viral mRNA synthesis is the endonucleolytic cleavage of heterologous RNAs containing cap 1 (m 7 GpppNm) structures to generate capped primers that are 10 to 13 nucleotides long, which are then elongated to form the viral mRNA chains. We examined the temperature sensitivity of these steps in vitro by using two WSN virus temperature-sensitive mutants, ts 1 and ts 6, which have a defect in the genome RNA segment coding for the viral PB 2 protein. For these experiments, {{it was necessary to}} employ purified <b>viral</b> <b>cores</b> rather than detergent-treated virions to catalyze transcription, as preparations of detergent-treated virions contain destabilizing or inhibitory activities which render even the transcription catalyzed by wild-type virus temperature sensitive. Using purified wild-type <b>viral</b> <b>cores,</b> we found that the rates of endonucleolytic cleavage of capped primers and of overall transcription were similar at 39. 5 and 33 °C, the in vivo nonpermissive and permissive temperatures, respectively. In contrast, the activities of the cap-dependent endonucleases of ts 1 and ts 6 <b>viral</b> <b>cores</b> at 39. 5 °C were only about 15 % of those at 33 °C. The steps in transcription after endonucleolytic cleavage of the capped RNA primer were largely, if not totally, temperature insensitive, indicating that the mutations in the PB 2 protein found in ts 1 and ts 6 virions affect only the endonuclease step. The temperature-sensitive defect is most likely in the recognition of the 5 ′-terminal cap 1 structure that occurs as a required {{first step in}} the endonuclease reaction: the cap-dependent binding of a specific capped primer fragment to ts 1 <b>viral</b> <b>cores</b> was temperature sensitive under conditions in which binding to wild-type <b>viral</b> <b>cores</b> was not affected by increasing the temperature from 33 to 39. 5 °C. Thus, our results establish that the viral PB 2 protein functions in cap recognition during the endonuclease reaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} glycoproteins of {{influenza}} virus, hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA) in the in vitro stimulation of natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity (NCMC) or natural killer activity of human peripheral blood lymphocytes was evaluated with radiolabeled K 562 cells as target cells in an overnight chromium release assay. Three different approaches were used. (i) Purified viral proteins were obtained by extraction with Nonidet P- 40, separation on a sucrose gradient, and further purification by affinity chromatography. Ficoll-Hypaque-purified peripheral blood lymphocytes exposed to HA or NA individually or to a mixture of both significantly increased NCMC (32 to 50 %). (ii) Treatment of HA and NA with their respective homologous antisera or F(ab') 2 antibody abrogated the stimulation of NCMC by these glycoproteins. (iii) Virions treated with proteolytic enzymes resulted in <b>viral</b> <b>cores</b> lacking either HA or NA or both activities. Compared to whole virions, <b>viral</b> <b>cores</b> devoid of HA activity only induced a 50 % increase in NCMC, whereas <b>viral</b> <b>cores</b> lacking HA activity and with traces of NA activity stimulated only 10 % of the NCMC. These results suggest that influenza virus-induced cell-mediated cytotoxicity {{is largely due to}} its glycoproteins...|$|R
50|$|The Orthopox {{virus that}} causes Camelpox behaves very {{similarly}} to the {{virus that causes}} Smallpox. After the virus attaches to a host cell, it injects its <b>viral</b> <b>core</b> (the shell containing its DNA) into the cell's cytoplasm. The virus carries DNA polymerase which is used to transcribe its genes. Eventually, the <b>viral</b> <b>core</b> dissolves, and the genetic material is bare within the cytoplasm. When all of the structural proteins have been produced, viral assembly takes place. The newly formed virus particles can be released during cell lysis, or they can derive a host cell produced membrane and be released via budding.|$|E
50|$|Viral {{replication}} is cytoplasmic. Entry {{into the}} host cell {{is achieved by}} attachment of the viral proteins to host glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which mediates cellular endocytosis of the virus. Fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane releases the <b>viral</b> <b>core</b> into the host cytoplasm. Expression of early-phase genes by viral RNA polymerase begins at 30 minutes post-infection. The <b>viral</b> <b>core</b> is completely uncoated as early expression ends, releasing the viral genome into the cytoplasm. At this point, intermediate genes are expressed, triggering genomic DNA replication by the viral DNA polymerase at approximately 100 minutes post-infection. Replication follows the DNA strand displacement model. Late genes are expressed from 140 min to 48 hours post-infection, producing all viral structural proteins. Assembly of progeny virions begins in cytoplasmic viral factories, producing an spherical immature particle. This virus particle matures into the brick-shaped intracellular mature virion (IMV). IMVs can be released upon cell lysis, or can acquire a second membrane from the Golgi apparatus and bud as extracellular enveloped virions (EEV). In this latter case, the virion is transported to the plasma membrane via microtubules.|$|E
50|$|Mamavirus {{possesses}} its own transcription machinery, and it packages transcription {{proteins in}} its particles. Transcription {{is believed to}} occur in the core particles. The core releases viral DNA and forms a cytoplasmic replication factory where DNA replication begins and transcription of late genes occurs. The replication factory forms around the <b>viral</b> <b>core</b> and expands until it occupies a large fraction of the amoeba cell volume. Later stages of the replication cycle involve partially assembled procapsids undergoing DNA packaging.|$|E
40|$|A {{component}} of streptovaricin complex inhibits the replication of poxvirus. To be effective, the inhibitor must be introduced {{early in the}} replication cycle; it appears to inhibit early messenger ribonucleic acid synthesis by <b>viral</b> <b>cores,</b> thus interfering with all subsequent events.

40|$|SummaryPoxvirus genome {{uncoating}} is a two-step process. First, cytoplasmic <b>viral</b> <b>cores</b> are activated {{and early}} viral genes are expressed. Next, cores are disassembled and the genomes released. This second step depends {{on an early}} viral factor(s) that has eluded identification for over 40 years. We used a large-scale, high-throughput RNAi screen directed against vaccinia virus (VACV) to identify the VACV AAA+ ATPase D 5 as the poxvirus uncoating factor. We show that the ATPase activity of D 5 is required for uncoating. Superresolution microscopy suggests that D 5 acts directly at <b>viral</b> <b>cores</b> for genome release. Thus, the putative helicase D 5 is a multifunctional protein required for genome uncoating and replication. Additionally, in vivo delivery of anti-D 5 siRNAs reduced virus production in a mouse model of VACV infection. These results demonstrate the use of virus-targeting RNAi libraries to investigate viral gene function and suggest therapeutic avenues...|$|R
40|$|Although {{microtubule}} motors mediate intracellular virus transport, {{the underlying}} interactions and control mechanisms remain poorly defined. This {{is particularly true}} for HIV- 1 cores, which undergo complex, interconnected processes of cytosolic transport, reverse transcription, and uncoating of the capsid shell. Although kinesins have been implicated in regulating these events, curiously, there are no direct kinesin-core interactions. We recently showed that the capsid-associated kinesin- 1 adaptor protein, fasciculation and elongation protein zeta- 1 (FEZ 1), regulates HIV- 1 trafficking. Here, we show that FEZ 1 and kinesin- 1 heavy, but not light, chains regulate not only HIV- 1 transport but also uncoating. This required FEZ 1 phosphorylation, which controls its interaction with kinesin- 1. HIV- 1 did not stimulate widespread FEZ 1 phosphorylation but, instead, bound microtubule (MT) affinity-regulating kinase 2 (MARK 2) to stimulate FEZ 1 phosphorylation on <b>viral</b> <b>cores.</b> Our findings reveal that HIV- 1 binds a regulatory kinase to locally control kinesin- 1 adaptor function on <b>viral</b> <b>cores,</b> thereby regulating both particle motility and uncoating...|$|R

The Env polyprotein encodes the surface glycoprotein (SU) and transmembrane glycoprotein (TM). Both SU and TM glycoproteins are heavily glycosylated, a characteristic that scientists believe may mask the B-cell epitopes of the Env glycoprotein giving the virus resistance to the virus neutralizing antibodies.|$|E

These micrographs show mimivirus capsid assembly in the nucleus, acquisition of an inner lipid membrane via budding from the nucleus, and particles similar to those found in many other viruses, including all NCLDV members. These particles are known in other viruses as viral factories and allow efficient viral assembly by modifying large areas of the host cell.|$|E

50|$|The general {{retrovirus}} genome {{consists of}} three genes vital for the invasion, replication, escape, and spreading of its viral genome. These three genes are gag (encodes for structural proteins for the <b>viral</b> <b>core),</b> pol(encodes for reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease), and env (encodes for coat proteins for the virus's exterior). These viral proteins are encoded as polyproteins. In order {{to carry out their}} life cycle, the retrovirus relies heavily on the host cell's machinery. Protease degrades peptide bonds of the viral polyproteins, making the separate proteins functional. Reverse transcriptase functions to synthesize viral DNA from the viral RNA in the host cell's cytoplasm before it entering the nucleus. Integrase guides the integration of viral DNA into the host genome.|$|E

40|$|A {{protein kinase}} was solubilized from whole vaccinia virions {{by using a}} {{solution}} containing deoxycholate, dithiothreitol, and sodium or potassium chloride. The released enzyme was completely dependent on Mg 2 + and was greatly stimulated by added basic proteins such as protamine or histones. Dithiothreitol was also stimulatory, whereas GTP, CTP, UTP, and Pi at concentrations equimolar with ATP {{had little or no}} effect. Attempts to purify the protein kinase were initially unsuccessful, leading us to consider that either the enzyme was extremely labile or that two readily separable components were required for activity. The observation that the material extracted with NP- 40 detergent during the preparation of <b>viral</b> <b>cores</b> stimulated the protein kinase activity of the intact cores supported the second possibility. As the protein kinase, now solubilized from <b>viral</b> <b>cores,</b> was passed through successive DEAE-cellulose columns, it became increasingly dependent for activity on addition of the NP- 40 extract. A 30 - to 40 -fold stimulation of protein kinase activity, which afforded recovery of essentially all starting activity, could be effected by addition of the NP- 40 extract to the partially purified enzyme. The NP- 40 extract was shown to contain a heat stable, trypsin-sensitive protein, whose action could not be duplicated by cyclic nucleotides...|$|R

Our results demonstrate that multiple <b>viral</b> <b>core</b> proteins are determinants of reovirus-induced myocarditis.

Among the <b>viral</b> <b>core</b> proteins, seven species (Vp 154, Vp 73, Vp 63, Vp 52, Vp 48, Vp 42, and Vp 25) were shown to have DNA-binding activities by Southwestern blot analysis. Except for Vp 154 and Vp 25, these DNA-binding proteins showed a specific affinity for the viral genomic DNA.

Three different clones (Vp 73 - 3, Vp 73 - 29,andVp 73 - 42) were obtained and analyzed. ORFs found in these clones all contained characteristic proline-rich motifs.

40|$|AbstractRubella virus (RV) {{infection}} induces {{a variety}} of morphological changes in the host cell including the modification of lysosomes to produce “replication complexes” and the alteration of mitochondrial morphology and distribution. The morphogenesis of RV was further characterized with particular emphasis on the localization of RV core particles. Thin-section electron microscopy (TSEM) studies indicated that RV core-like particles, measuring approximately 33 nm in diameter, were found associated with RV replication complexes. Immunogold-labeling electron microscopy (EM) using monoclonal antibodies to RV capsid proteins confirmed that these particles were <b>viral</b> <b>cores.</b> RV core particles were also detected in association with mitochondria as observed by TSEM and immunogold-labeling EM using monoclonal antibodies to capsid or polyclonal antibodies to RV virions.

40|$|The murine leukaemia virus (MLV) {{gag gene}} encodes a small protein called p 12 that is {{essential}} for the early steps of viral replication. The N- and C-terminal regions of p 12 are sequentially acting domains, both required for p 12 function. Defects in the C-terminal domain can be overcome by introducing a chromatin binding motif into the protein. However, the function of the N-terminal domain remains unknown. Here, we undertook a detailed analysis of the effects of p 12 mutation on incoming <b>viral</b> <b>cores.</b> We found that both reverse transcription complexes and isolated mature cores from N-terminal p 12 mutants have altered capsid complexes compared to wild type virions. Electron microscopy revealed that mature N-terminal p 12 mutant cores have different morphologies, although immature cores appear normal. Moreover, in immunofluorescent studies, both p 12 and capsid proteins were lost rapidly from N-terminal p 12 mutant <b>viral</b> <b>cores</b> after entry into target cells. Importantly, we determined that p 12 binds directly to the MLV capsid lattice. However, we could not detect binding of an N-terminally altered p 12 to capsid. Altogether, our data imply that p 12 stabilises the mature MLV core, preventing premature loss of capsid, and that this is mediated by direct binding of p 12 to the capsid shell. In this manner, p 12 is also retained in the pre-integration complex where it facilitates tethering to mitotic chromosomes. These data also explain our previous observations that modifications to the N-terminus of p 12 alter the ability of particles to abrogat...|$|R
