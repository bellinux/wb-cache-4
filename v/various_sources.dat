40|$|Abstract. Tropospheric carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) was measured through out 2001 using ground-based Fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectrometer at Moshiri (44. 4 °N) and Rikubetsu (43. 5 °N) observatories in northern Japan, which {{are separated by}} 150 km. Seasonal and day-to-day variations of CO are studied using these data, and contributions from <b>various</b> CO <b>sources</b> are evaluated using three-dimensional global chemistry transport model (GEOS-CHEM) calculations. Seasonal maximum and minimum FTIR-derived tropospheric CO amounts occurred in April and September, respectively. The ratio of partial column amounts between the 0 - 4 - and 0 - 12 -km altitude ranges {{is found to be}} slightly greater in early spring. The GEOS-CHEM model calculations generally reproduce these observed features. Further analyses using source-labeled CO model calculations suggest that the observed seasonal variation was caused by a combination of seasonal variations of <b>various</b> <b>source</b> contributions, in addition to a seasonal change in chemical CO loss by OH. A seasonal change in the meteorological fields largely control the changes in <b>various</b> <b>source</b> contributions. The contribution from fossil fuel (FF) combustion in Asia an...|$|R

5|$|Non-musical subjects, both {{religious}} and numerological, influenced Sorabji's music, too, {{and he took}} inspiration from <b>various</b> <b>sources.</b> His Fifth Piano Sonata (Opus archimagicum) is inspired by the tarot, and his Tāntrik Symphony for Piano Alone has seven movements titled after the bodily centres of Tantric and Shaktic yoga. The song Benedizione di San Francesco d'Assisi sets the text of a Catholic benediction. However, Sorabji did not intend the first two of these works to be programmatic, and he heaped scorn on attempts to represent stories or ideologies in music. Nevertheless, some of his works {{have been described as}} programmatic.|$|E
