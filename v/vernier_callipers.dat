40|$|An {{investigation}} is presented {{of a low}} cost approach to the measurement of two and three dimensional objects using a flatbed scanner and image analysis software. Conventional measurement using relatively low cost instruments such as micrometers and <b>vernier</b> <b>callipers</b> can be time consuming and requires operator skills which result in higher overall costs. The increasing resolution and decreasing prices of flatbed scanners introduces the possibility of their use as a low cost alternative to traditional manual measuring. To investigate this, a simple dimensional measurement technique was developed using an unmodified, then a modified, flatbed scanner, a standard PC, and software.

40|$|Mandibular {{range of}} motion (ROM), {{vertical}} and horizontal, is often measured {{as a part of}} a diagnostic assessment of temporomandibular joint disorders. Ln the literature, a fixed ratio between the vertical and the horizontal ROM has been suggested, i. e. 4 : 1. The ratio is frequently used to predict the vertical ROM on the basis of the horizontal ROM and vice versa. However, no scientific data are available to substantiate the ratio suggested. The aim of this study was to determine whether the fixed ratio of 4 : 1 exists and, if so, whether this ratio has a predictive value.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} the dimensions of the distal femoral intercondylar notch (ICN) and the composition and metabolism of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in three dog breeds with different relevant risks to ligament rupture and subsequent osteoarthritis (OA). DesignICN measurements were obtained from the femurs of Golden Retrievers (high risk), Labrador Retrievers (high risk) and Greyhounds (low risk). Femoral condyle width and height, ICN height and width indices, and notch shape index were measured using <b>Vernier</b> <b>callipers</b> in all dogs. Intact ACLs were obtained from the same dog breeds for a study of the impinged areas and were analysed for collagen content, collagen cross-links, and sulphated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 2 and the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) - 1 and - 2. ResultsFemoral condyle width and height and ICN width indices were significantly greater in the low risk compared to the high risk breeds (P< 0. 01 for all parameters). In contrast, the pro (P= 0. 003) and active (P= 0. 007) forms of MMP- 2 and sulphated GAGs (P= 0. 0002) were significantly greater in the impinged areas of the ACLs of the rupture predisposed breeds. ConclusionsImpingement by the ICN on the ACLs of the high risk breeds may result in increased collagen remodelling and increased sulphated GAG deposition, causing reduced structural integrity of the ligament. Altered ACL composition may predispose the ligament to increased laxity leading to joint degeneration and OA. This may have a comparative implication for pathogenesis of ACL rupture in humans...|$|E

40|$|Background: Predicting {{the size}} of unerupted teeth during the mixed {{dentition}} period is {{a critical factor in}} managing the developing occlusion. Different studies found that the combined width of only the four mandibular permanent incisors is not a good predictor of the sum of unerupted mandibular permanent canines and premolars (SPCP). In 2007, Melgaço et al. developed a new method for SPCP by measuring the sum of the mandibular first permanent molars and four mandibular permanent incisors (SMI). Aim: It was aimed to evaluate the accuracy of this new method in comparison with Moyers′ mixed dentition analysis table in contemporary Indian population. Settings and Design: Sixty boys and 60 girls from Gandhinagar district (age ranged from 12 to 14 years) were included. Materials and Methods: The mesiodistal crown widths of all fully erupted teeth were measured with digital <b>vernier</b> <b>callipers</b> and the odontometric values obtained were then subjected to statistical and linear regression analysis. Results: Student′s unpaired t-test gave statistically significant difference between the original values of teeth and the values obtained by Melgaço′s prediction equation as well as Moyers′ mixed dentition analysis table (P < 0. 001). High values of correlation (r = 0. 77) and determination coefficients (r 2 = 0. 59) were found while considering Melgaço′s method. Also, no statistically significant difference was found between the tooth sizes of males and females. Conclusion: From this study, it can be evaluated that Melgaço′s method gives better prediction and a simplified equation Y = 0. 925 X can be suggested for the present population...|$|E

Numerous studies have investigated the association between 2 D: 4 D ratios {{and a range of}} testosterone balance influenced traits and conditions including spatial ability and sexual-orientation although discrepancies exist within the literature. Objectives: To measure and calculate 2 D: 4 D ratios and (Dr-l) values. Establish whether correlations exist between ratios and sexual orientation and spatial abilities. Methods: 65 volunteers participated in this project. Digit measurements were taken using digital <b>vernier</b> <b>callipers.</b> Ethnicity, hand-dominance and sexual-orientation were established through questionnaires. The Santa Barbra solids test assessed spatial ability. Participants were separated according to gender (males n= 26, females n= 39) and further sub-grouped with regards to ethnicity, hand-dominance and sexual-orientation. Results: Digit ratios were significantly lower in male right hand ratios and Dr-l values compared to females. Although consistent with regards to gender, ethnicity appeared to be a significant covariate. 2 D: 4 D ratios {{do not appear to be}} an index of sexual-orientation or spatial abilities. Conclusion: Right hand 2 D: 4 D ratios and Dr-l values are sexually dimorphic. Demographic limitations may be accountable for the lack of correlation between digit ratios and sexual orientation. There are no correlations between digit ratios and spatial abilities. Key Words: 2 D: 4 D, Dr-l, prenatal testosterone, sexual-orientation, spatial abilities, sexual dimorphis...|$|E
30|$|Growth of {{stems and}} leaves were {{measured}} following {{the method of}} Hagen and Spomer (1989) {{at the end of}} the growing seasons 1996, 1997 and 1998. Stem elongation was measured as the distance from the oldest to the youngest green leaf, leaf length and width was measured on the fourth leaf from the apex. The measurements were made with a digital <b>vernier</b> <b>calliper</b> on 10 randomly chosen stems from each treatment plot. The cover of S. acaulis in the rich meadow community was measured by using a 1 x 1  m grid-frame with 100 points in each plot and fixed points in each of the corners of the plots; the same grid-frame was used in each measurement to ensure accuracy (Walker 1996). The cover of S. acaulis was measured once in mid-August in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2001. Biomass was calculated from cover using a scaling factor as in Molau (2010). At the end of each season (late August, 1995 – 2000), the number of mature capsules (hereafter fruits) was inventoried in all plots. Number of fruits was used as a rough estimate of reproductive success as number of fruits and number of seeds has previously been shown to correlate positively in cushions of S. acaulis (Alatalo and Molau 2001).|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate, on a longitudinal basis, the changes in intercanine and intermolar widths form the primary to the early mixed dentition periods. Materials and Methods: A total of 38 children aged 4 - 5 years, with normal occlusion without any proximal caries or any dental anomalies, were selected. The impressions were recorded and casts were prepared. Intercanine and intermolar widths were measured on these dental casts {{with the help of a}} digital <b>vernier</b> <b>calliper.</b> After 3 years follow-up, the impressions were recorded again and dental casts were prepared. Intercanine and intermolar widths were measured again at this stage and were compared with the baseline data using the paired t-test and the chi square test. Results: There is a significant increase in the intercanine (3. 93 + 1. 70 mm) and intermolar width (1. 49 + 1. 77 mm) during the transition period from primary to early mixed dentition in both the arches and both the sexes. The gender-wise comparison showed a greater increase in males than in females, but this was not statistically significant. Conclusion: A thorough knowledge of growth changes during various stages of the mixed dentition period are important for a pediatric dentist to make an accurate diagnosis and treatment planning during preventive and interceptive orthodontics...|$|R
40|$|Atypical {{prenatal}} hormone exposure {{could be}} a factor in the development of transsexualism. There is evidence that the 2 nd and 4 th digit ratio (2 D[*]:[*] 4 D) associates negatively with prenatal testosterone and positively with estrogens. The aim was to assess the difference in 2 D[*]:[*] 4 D between female to male transsexuals (FMT) and male to female transsexuals (MFT) and controls. We examined 42 [*]MFT, 38 [*]FMT, and 45 control males and 48 control females. Precise measurements were made by X-rays at the ventral surface of both hands from the basal crease of the digit to the tip using <b>vernier</b> <b>calliper.</b> Control male and female patients had larger 2 D[*]:[*] 4 D of the right hand when compared to the left hand. Control male’s left hand ratio was lower than in control female’s left hand. There was no difference in 2 D[*]:[*] 4 D between MFT and control males. MFT showed similar 2 D[*]:[*] 4 D of the right hand with control women indicating possible influencing factor in embryogenesis and consequently finger length changes. FMT showed the lowest 2 D[*]:[*] 4 D of the left hand when compared to the control males and females. Results of our study go in favour of the biological aetiology of transsexualism...|$|R
