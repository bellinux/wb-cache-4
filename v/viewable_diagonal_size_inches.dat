50|$|The LG G6 {{utilizes}} a metal chassis {{with a glass}} backing, and is IP68-rated {{for water}} and dust-resistance. It is available in black, white, and silver-color finishes. The G6 features a 1440p FullVision IPS LCD display, with a <b>diagonal</b> <b>size</b> of 5.7 <b>inches.</b> LG stated that it intended for the G6 to be a large-screened phone that would still be compact and feasible for one-handed use; the display uses a 2:1 (marketed as 18:9) aspect ratio that is taller than the 16:9 displays used {{by the majority of}} smartphones. The G6 was also designed with slim bezels, and is slightly smaller in size than the G5. To allow for reinforcement around the corners of the display, the display panel itself has rounded edges. The display also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision high-dynamic-range video.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{response}} to the challenge of providing a large area avionics display for the E- 2 D AHE aircraft. The resulting display design provides a pilot with high-resolution visual information content covering an image area of almost three square feet (Active Area of Samsung display = 33. 792 cm x 27. 0336 cm = 13. 304 ” x 10. 643 ” = 141. 596 square inches = 0. 983 sq. ft x 3 = 2. 95 sq. ft). The avionics display application, design and performance being described is the Primary Flight Display for the E- 2 D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft. This cockpit display has a screen <b>diagonal</b> <b>size</b> of 17 <b>inches.</b> Three displays, with minimum bezel width, just fit within the available instrument panel area. The significant design constraints of supporting an upgrade installation have been addressed. These constraints include a display image size that is larger than the mounting opening in the instrument panel. This, therefore, requires that the Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) window, LCD panel and backlight all fit within the limited available bezel depth. High brightness and a wide dimming range are supported with a dual mode Cold Cathode Fluorescent Tube (CCFT) and LED backlight. Packaging constraints dictated the use of multiple U shaped fluorescent lamps in a direct view backlight design for a maximum display brightness of 300 foot-Lamberts. The low intensity backlight levels are provided by remote LEDs coupled through a fiber optic mesh. This architecture generates luminous uniformity within a minimum backlight depth. Cross-cockpit viewing is supported with ultra-wide field-of-view performance including contrast an...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted in February 2017 in the Village Nipah Panjang 2, Subdistrict Nipah Panjang, Tanjung Jabung Timur Regency, Province of Jambi. The method used is to observe directly the fishing gear used by fishermen. This study aims to produce an Efficient gillnet fishing gear design through {{an assessment of the}} construction of gillnet used by fishermen. The principle of design theory uses the reference formula Sadhori (1984) and Fridman (1986). The results show that the construction of gillnet consists as webbing, upper main line, under main line, float line, sinker line, float, sinker I, sinker II and buoy. Based on the calculation of design formula was obtained distinguish of mesh size, spin of line, number of float and sinker, floats and sinker mounting distance. The spin direction used in the sample as Z-Z, while for the new design it is better to use the opposite spin direction such as Z-S or S-Z. The number of sample float is 701 pieces with a distance of 1 m (mesh <b>size</b> 3 <b>inch)</b> and 401 pieces with a distance of 1 m (mesh <b>size</b> 7 <b>inch).</b> While the recommended number of float is 1567 pieces with a distance of 45 cm (mesh <b>size</b> 3 <b>inch)</b> and 540 pieces with a distance of 75 cm (mesh <b>size</b> 7 <b>inch).</b> The number of sample sinker is 1556 pieces with a distance of 45 cm (mesh <b>size</b> 3 <b>inch)</b> and 160 pieces with a distance of 2, 5 m (mesh <b>size</b> 7 <b>inch).</b> While the recommended amount of sinker is 1923 pieces with a distance of 36 cm (mesh <b>size</b> 3 <b>inch)</b> and 664 pieces with a distance of 60 cm (mesh <b>size</b> 7 <b>inch).</b> The number of buoy sample is 42 pieces (mesh <b>size</b> 3 <b>inch)</b> and 24 pieces (mesh <b>size</b> 7 <b>inch).</b> While the recommended buoy is 41 pieces (mesh <b>size</b> 3 <b>inch)</b> and 14 pieces (mesh <b>size</b> 7 <b>inch...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{overview}} {{of the development of}} two microphone directional arrays for aeroacoustic testing is presented. These arrays were specifically developed to measure airframe noise in the NASA Langley Quiet Flow Facility. A large aperture directional array using 35 flush-mounted microphones was constructed to obtain high resolution noise localization maps around airframe models. This array possesses a maximum <b>diagonal</b> aperture <b>size</b> of 34 <b>inches.</b> A unique logarithmic spiral layout design was chosen for the targeted frequency range of 2 - 30 kHz. Complementing the large array is a small aperture directional array, constructed to obtain spectra and directivity information from regions on the model. This array, possessing 33 microphones with a maximum <b>diagonal</b> aperture <b>size</b> of 7. 76 inches, is easily moved about the model in elevation and azimuth. Custom microphone shading algorithms have been developed to provide a frequency- and position-invariant sensing area from 10 - 40 kHz with an overall target [...] ...|$|R
