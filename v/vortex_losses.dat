40|$|A {{first study}} on the {{continuous}} adjoint formulation for aerodynamic optimization design of high pressure turbines based on S 2 surface governed by the Euler equations with source terms is presented. The objective function is defined as an integral function along the boundaries, and the adjoint equations and the boundary conditions are derived by introducing the adjoint variable vectors. The gradient expression of the objective function then includes only the terms related to physical shape variations. The numerical solution of the adjoint equation is conducted by a finite-difference method with the Jameson spatial scheme employing {{the first and the}} third order dissipative fluxes. A gradient-based aerodynamic optimization system is established by integrating the blade stagger angles, the stacking lines and the passage perturbation parameterization with the quasi-Newton method of Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS). The application of the continuous adjoint method is validated through a single stage high pressure turbine optimization case. The adiabatic efficiency increases from 0. 8875 to 0. 8931, whilst the mass flow rate and the pressure ratio remain almost unchanged.

Turbine similarity design based on the existing air turbine profiles is time saving. Due to totally different thermodynamic properties between organic fluids and air, its influence on turbine performance and loss mechanisms need to be analyzed. This paper numerically simulated a radial turbine under similar conditions between R 245 fa and air, and compared the differences of the turbine performance and loss mechanisms. Larger specific heat ratio of air leads to air turbine operating at higher pressure ratios. As R 245 fa gas constant is only about one-fifth of air gas constant, reduced rotating speeds of R 245 fa turbine are only 0. 4 -fold of those of air turbine, and reduced mass flow rates are about twice of those of air turbine.

40|$|In this master's thesis, I {{present the}} design, fabrication, and {{characterisation}} of superconducting microwave resonators. These resonators are quarter-wavelength coplanar waveguide resonators, operating at resonance frequencies between 4 GHz and 8 GHz. This kind of resonator {{is a key}} component in several applications, ranging from quantum computation devices to parametric amplifiers. Minimising the losses (achieving high internal quality factors) in these resonators is important to maximise performance of the applications they are used for. During the thesis work, we have studied several possible changes to improve the resonator quality. Fabrication of the resonators {{was done in the}} Nanofabrication Laboratory at Chalmers University of Technology, and consist of the following steps: cleaning a sapphire or silicon wafer, depositing a layer of superconducting niobium, photolithography, and etching the waveguide. We then measured the resonators in a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator, at a temperature of 10 mK. The measurements consisted of a power sweep, in order to quantify the quality factor at high and low excitation powers. As an example, the first resonator we fabricated had a quality factor of 4. 3 x 10 ^ 4 at high power (about 10 ^ 5 photons in the resonator), and quality factor of 3. 7 x 10 ^ 4 at the single-photon level. We then investigated different loss mechanisms that we expect to negatively affect the quality factor, and how to reduce this loss. Firstly, to reduce radiation losses and magnetic <b>vortex</b> <b>losses,</b> we reduced the lateral dimensions of the resonator. Secondly, as two-level system (TLS) losses are believed to mainly reside at the surfaces of the materials and interfaces between them, we etched into the substrate to selectively move a part of the TLS away from the resonator. We also studied the effect of the meandering of the resonator on the quality factor, as well as using two different etching gasses. By gathering all this data, we were then able to compare the different combinations to see the effect of the changing parameters. In conclusion, the reduced lateral dimensions and the removal of part of the substrate indeed reduce the losses, as expected from the theory. We also found interesting behaviour with regards to the meandering, namely that having a meandered structure negatively affects the quality factor. Combining all results, we can give a guideline for the fabrication of resonators in the future, which gave us a quality factor up to 4. 9 x 10 ^ 5 at high excitation power, and 3. 0 x 10 ^ 5 at the single photon level...|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional {{numerical}} simulations (RANS and URANS) {{were used}} {{to assess the impact of}} two specific design features, and of aspects of the actual turbine environment, on turbine blade tip loss. The calculations were carried out for a subsonic high pressure turbine stage. The loss mechanism examined is that due to tip clearance vortex mixing. The effects examined were three-dimensional blade stacking, downstream transition duct geometry, and unsteadiness due to an upstream nozzle guide vane. Tip leakage loss changes due to three-dimensional blade stacking (bowing or reverse bowing) are verified to be associated with changes in the magnitude of blade tip loading, which create differences in the leakage flow exit velocities. The effect of a downstream diffusing transition duct on tip leakage losses is small; there was a 3. 6 % increase in tip leakage loss for a 65 % increase in duct exit-to-inlet area ratio compared to a constant area duct. For unsteadiness arising from an upstream nozzle guide vane, it is shown that substantial temporal fluctuations in vortex core velocity and loss generation exist. However, the time average tip leakage loss differed less than 5 % from the tip leakage loss calculated on a steady flow basis. Based on the computations, the mechanism for tip leakage <b>vortex</b> <b>loss</b> in the three different situations examined appears to be similar to that which is seen for an isolated turbine blade. by Steven Mazur.

40|$|Ozone {{observations}} from ozonesondes, the lidars aboard the DC- 8, in situ ozone measurements from the ER- 2, and satellite ozone measurements from Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement III (POAM) {{were used to}} assess ozone loss during the Sage III Ozone Loss and Validation Experiment (SOLVE) 1999 - 2000 Arctic campaign. Two methods of analysis were used. In the first method a simple regression analysis is performed on the ozonesonde and POAM measurements within the vortex. In the second method, the ozone measurements from all available ozone data were injected into a free running diabatic trajectory model and carried forward in time from December 1 to March 15. <b>Vortex</b> ozone <b>loss</b> was then estimated by comparing the ozone values of those parcels initiated early in the campaign with those parcels injected later in the campaign. Despite the variety of observational techniques used during SOLVE, the measurements provide a fairly consistent picture. Over the whole vortex, the largest ozone loss occurs between 550 and 400 K potential temperatures (approximately 23 - 16 km) with over 1. 5 ppmv lost by March 15, the end of the SOLVE mission period. An ozone loss rate of 0. 04 - 0. 05 ppmv/day was computed for March 15. Ozonesondes launched after March 15 suggest that an additional 0. 5 ppmv or more ozone was lost between March 15 and April 1. The small disagreement between ozonesonde and POAM analysis of January ozone loss is found to be due to biases in vortex sampling. POAM makes most of its solar occultation measurements at the vortex edge during January 2000 which bias samples toward air parcels that have been exposed to sunlight and likely do experience ozone loss. Ozonesonde measurements and the trajectory technique use observations that are more distributed within the interior of the vortex. Thus the regression analysis of the POAM measurements tends to overestimate mid-winter <b>vortex</b> ozone <b>loss.</b> Finally, our loss calculations are broadly consistent with other loss computations using ER- 2 tracer data and MLS satellite data, but we find no evidence for the 1992 high mid-January loss reported using the Match technique...|$|R

Because of these vortex dynamic features, the behavior is dierent from the conventional view of the effect of pressure level on mixing of non- uniform flows. More specifically, it is shown, through control volume arguments and axisymmetric computations, that as a strongly swirling ow passes through a pres- sure rise, the mixed-out loss can either decrease or increase, the latter occurring if the deceleration becomes large enough to initiate vortex breakdown. It is further shown that tip vortices in turbines experience pressure rises large enough to cause vortex breakdown. The effect of pressure distribution on tip leakage losses is illustrated through examination of two turbine blades, one designed with a forward loaded tip and one with an aft loaded tip. The computations show a 16 % difference in tip clearance loss between the two, due to the lower pressure rise encountered by the clearance vortex, and hence lower <b>vortex</b> breakdown <b>losses,</b> with the forward loaded blade.

In the second method the ozone measurements from all availableozone data were injected into a free-running diabatic trajectory model and were carried forward intime from 1 December to 15 March. <b>Vortex</b> ozone <b>loss</b> was then estimated by comparing the ozonevalues of those parcels initiated early in the campaign with those parcels injected later in thecampaign. Despite the variety of observational techniques used during SOLVE, the measurementsprovide a fairly consistent picture. Over the whole vortex the largest ozone loss occurs between 550 and 400 K potential temperatures (~ 23 - 16 km) with over 1. 5 ppmv (~ 55 %) lost by 15 March,the end of the SOLVE mission period. An ozone loss rate of 0. 04 - 0. 05 ppmv/day was computed for 15 March. The total column loss was between 44 and 57 DU or 11 - 15 %. Ozonesondes launchedafter 15 March suggest that an additional 0. 5 ppmv or more ozone was lost between 15 March and 1 April...|$|R
40|$|An offline 3 D {{chemical}} transport model (CTM) {{has been used}} to study the evolution of the Antarctic ozone hole during the sudden warming event of 2002 and to compare it with similar simulations for 2000. The CTM has a detailed stratospheric chemistry scheme and was forced by ECMWF and Met Office analyses. Both sets of meteorological analyses permit the CTM to produce a good simulation of the evolution of the 2002 vortex and its breakup, based on O 3 comparisons with Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) column data, sonde data, and first results from the Environmental Satellite–Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (ENVISAT–MIPAS) instrument. The ozone chemical loss rates in the polar lower stratosphere in September 2002 were generally less than in 2000, because of the smaller average active chlorine, although {{around the time of the}} warming, the largest <b>vortex</b> chemical <b>loss</b> rates were similar to those in 2000 (i. e., − 2. 6 DU day− 1 between 12 and 26 km). However, the disturbed vortex of 2002 caused a somewhat larger influence of polar processing on Southern Hemisphere (SH) midlatitudes in September. Overall, the calculations show that the average SH chemical O 3 loss (poleward of 30 °S) by September was ∼ 20 DU less in 2002 compared with 2000. A significant contribution to the much larger observed polar O 3 column in September 2002 was due to the enhanced descent at the vortex edge and increased horizontal transport, associated with the distorted vortex...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of superconducting devices to electromagnetic radiation is a core concept implemented in diverse applications, {{ranging from the}} currently used voltage standard to single photon detectors in astronomy. Suprisingly, a sufficiently high power subgap radiation may stimulate superconductivity itself. The possibility of stimulating type II superconductors, in which the radiation may interact also with vortex cores, remains however unclear. Here we report on superconductivity enhanced by GHz radiation in type II superconducting Pb films {{in the presence of}} vortices. The stimulation effect is more clearly observed in the upper critical field and less pronounced in the critical temperature. The magnetic field dependence of the <b>vortex</b> related microwave <b>losses</b> in a film with periodic pinning reveals a reduced dissipation of mobile vortices in the stimulated regime due to a reduction of the core size. Results of numerical simulations support the validy of this conclusion. Our findings may have intriguing connections with holographic superconductors in which the possibility of stimulation is under current debate. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{frequency}} of days with extreme low (termed ELOs) and extreme high (termed EHOs) total ozone values and their influence on mean values and trends are analyzed for the world's longest total ozone record (Arosa, Switzerland). The results show (a) an increase in ELOs and (b) a decrease in EHOs during the last decades and (c) that the overall trend during the 1970 s and 1980 s in total ozone is strongly dominated by changes in these extreme events. After removing the extremes, the time series shows a strongly reduced trend (reduction {{by a factor of}} 2. 5 for trend in annual mean). Excursions in {{the frequency of}} extreme events reveal "fingerprints" of dynamical factors such as ENSO or NAO, and chemical factors, such as cold Arctic <b>vortex</b> ozone <b>losses,</b> as well as major volcanic eruptions of the 20 th century (Gunung Agung, El Chichón, Mt. Pinatubo). Furthermore, atmospheric loading of ozone depleting substances leads to a continuous modification of column ozone in the Northern Hemisphere also with respect to extreme values (partly again in connection with polar vortex contributions). Application of extreme value theory allows the identification of many more such "fingerprints" than conventional time series analysis of annual and seasonal mean values. The analysis shows in particular the strong influence of dynamics, revealing that even moderate ENSO and NAO events have a discernible effect on total ozone. Overall the approach to extremal modelling provides new information on time series properties, variability, trends and the influence of dynamics and chemistry, complementing earlier analyses focusing only on monthly (or annual) mean values...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} {{that control the}} temperature of the polar lower stratosphere during spring is key to understanding ozone loss in the Arctic polar <b>vortex.</b> Spring ozone <b>loss</b> rates are directly tied to polar stratospheric temperatures by the formation of polar stratospheric clouds, and the conversion of chlorine species to reactive forms on these cloud particle surfaces. In this paper, we study those factors that control temperatures in the polar lower stratosphere. We use the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) /NCAR reanalysis data covering the last two decades to investigate how planetary wave driving of the stratosphere is connected to polar temperatures. In particular, we show that planetary waves forced in the troposphere in mid- to late winter (January-February) are principally responsible for the mean polar temperature during the March period. These planetary waves are forced by both thermal and orographic processes in the troposphere, and propagate into the stratosphere in the mid and high latitudes. Strong mid-winter planetary wave forcing leads to a warmer Arctic lower stratosphere in early spring, while weak mid-winter forcing leads to cooler Arctic temperatures...|$|R
