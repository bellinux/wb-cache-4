30|$|As to the {{integration}} of effort, the connection among agents within a DEE is important. Common methods used to advance integration in ZGC are value co-creation and physical and <b>virtual</b> <b>collocation</b> (Gulati et al., 2012; Puranam et al., 2014). Some connections are visible, while others are invisible and hard to capture. These invisible connections {{are similar to the}} routine details or hidden rules in an organization which are based on formal authority and hierarchy. In DEEs, they are more detailed and complex. We argue that enabling elements such as a supportive culture and intensive use of conferences enhance these connections and therefore, achieve integration of effort.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Although <b>virtual</b> <b>collocation</b> of Service Providers (SPs) {{on top of}} Infrastructure Providers (InPs) via network {{virtualization}} brings various benefits, we posit that operational confidentiality has {{not been}} considered in this network model. We extend and apply the Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) protocol to solving Minimum Disclosure Routing (MDR), that is, enabling an SP to route packets without disclosing routing information to InPs. Our study reveals that MDR can be achieved securely with marginal latency overhead {{with regard to the}} convergence time in well-engineered routing algorithms. Our study sheds light on the path for network virtualization to be used to resolve the challenges for ISPs of today. I...|$|E

This paper describes EXECO, a library providing easy and efficient control of local or remote, standalone or parallel, processes execution, as well as tools designed for scripting distributed computer science experiments or tests on any computing platform, in particular on the Grid' 5000 testbed. EXECO usage is illustrated by two experiments exploring the impact on performances of <b>virtual</b> machines <b>collocation</b> and the performances of virtual machines migrations...|$|R
3000|$|Keller et al. [85] and Fukushima et al. [47] open up {{theoretical}} research directions for intra-InP and inter-InP routing respectively. The inter-InP routing should not disclose routing information to InPs other than intended InPs (i.e minimum disclosure) and also provide operational confidentiality in routing process. MDR offers both minimum disclosure and operational confidentiality among InPs {{but does not}} provide other properties mentioned in Table 4. The intra-InP and inter-InP routing should possess the security requirements, R 6 and R 7 with the consideration of tenants’ <b>virtual</b> network <b>collocation.</b> We pose the following research questions for routing process in the federation by including aforementioned security requirements: How the router maintains routing table using intra-InP and inter-InP routing? How the information (i.e., packets) of different virtual networks of cloud users are separated? How the router will forward the packets of different virtual networks without exposing or compromising?

30|$|Culture {{influences}} {{the actions of}} people (Swidler, 1986). Culture is a critical element in a DEE (Spigel, 2015). The effect of an entrepreneurial culture shapes the actions of people within a DEE, and people sharing the same culture are connected to enforce the integration of effort. Agents in the DEE may not share the system-level goal, but they share the same culture, which is critical to shape the connection among these agents. Meanwhile, intensive conferences link numerous individuals and activities and have positive effects on the emergence of innovations in certain fields (Garud, 2008). Value co-creation and physical plus <b>virtual</b> <b>collocation</b> construct the main connection among agents, while a supportive culture and intensive conferences achieve connection so that the integration of effort is accomplished. Therefore, the supportive elements of culture and conferences are necessary for the integration of effort.|$|E
40|$|Networked {{control systems}} could {{possibly}} constitute {{the next logical}} step in the evolution of control, leading to the convergence of control with communication and computing. A central challenge is that traditional digital control methods cannot be directly applied to such systems. However, if appropriate system abstractions can be engineered, then such methods and theory can still be utilized. Our thesis is that a well designed middleware framework can indeed manufacture such an abstraction of <b>virtual</b> <b>collocation,</b> and thereby, propel the further proliferation of networked control systems. In this thesis, we present such a middleware framework for networked control systems. Central to this framework is Etherware, a message oriented component middleware for such systems. We begin with {{a detailed description of the}} design and architecture of Etherware, and illustrate Etherware based development of networked control systems through a fairly complex traffic control testbed application. Building on the middleware, we addres...|$|E
40|$|In {{a globalized}} world, New Product Development (NPD) becomes crucial for {{organizations}} to increase competitiveness. In order to quickly respond to dynamic customer requirements, the way organizations operate their NPD teams plays a significant role. An efficient operational method not only improves collaboration but also accelerates the NPD process. Thanks to technology innovation, {{information and communication}} technology (ICT) enables organizations to collocate teams virtually. This report comprises two case studies which use qualitative methods― interviews for research. The findings illustrate different perspectives of the NPD process and the diverse organizational structure between an electronic company and a garment manufacturing company. From these two cases, it is concluded {{a number of factors}} which reveal the major differences between physical and virtual teams. Thus, it is suggested organizations should take new product development process, organizational structure and ICT adoption into account when establishing and operationalizing NPD teams. In addition, the results illustrate that the NPD process and team collaboration are positively associated with ICT. Furthermore, both physical collocation and <b>virtual</b> <b>collocation</b> strongly correlate with ICT. Finally, this report reveals that ICT-technology supports the effective functioning of each functional teams...|$|E
40|$|Both organisations and {{individuals}} are using more collaborative work, across geographic, disciplinary and organisational boundaries, leading to {{increased demand for}} Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to support a more effective and efficient distributed collaboration. This thesis presents an empirical study exploring various aspects related to collaborative distance {{in the context of}} innovation projects. It focuses on the investigation of issues related to distance factors that affect collaboration effectiveness and efficiency. A total of 14 focus group interviews, undertaken with 75 participants in a comparative study of 14 project cases, revealed sufficient evidence on distance factors in the context of mixed (face-to-face and online or <b>virtual)</b> <b>collocation</b> modes. The results confirmed the positive role of collaboration technology for compressing geographical and temporal types of distance; other distance types were also bridged, however, other distance types were created. This empirical study aims to enlarge the academic understanding of distance factors by disambiguating their description and deciphering their role in the collaboration process, and clarifying the reasons for the use and improvement of collaboration technology for overcoming collaborative distances. It also confirms that distance factors raise collaboration barriers, and reveals that they disturb the collaboration mechanics by hindering knowledge workers’ capacity to reach a mutual understanding. Such findings have deep implications for the future enhancement of collaboration technology to fill the current gaps in distributed collaboration, also called e-Collaboration...|$|E
