He is a Fulbright Scholar {{pursuing}} a master's degree in student affairs administration at Michigan State University. Outgoing and involved, T.J. is active in several student organizations pertaining to performance art, gender, and social change. He lives with other students in a housing cooperative. His mother lives in a close-knit Armenian community in Cyprus, where the news would surely travel if T.J. transitions. Because his mother opposes his transition, and because he must return to Cyprus for two years due to a travel <b>visa</b> <b>requirement,</b> he has not yet started HRT.|$|E

However, Mexicans entering Canada before 1 December would continue to need a visa. On the same day, Mexican nationals could no longer apply for a visa online and had to apply on paper through a visa application centre. The <b>visa</b> <b>requirement</b> was lifted on 1 December as planned and the issuance of visas to Mexican nationals ceased, although Statistics Canada predicts that the net cost of lifting the <b>visa</b> <b>requirement</b> is over C$262 million in the next decade, which includes the additional immigration enforcement resources and the extra costs of processing asylum claims.|$|E

25|$|Some {{countries}} {{apply the}} principle of reciprocity in their visa policy. A country's visa policy is called 'reciprocal' if it imposes <b>visa</b> <b>requirement</b> against citizens of all the countries which impose visa requirements against its own citizens. The opposite is rarely true: a country rarely lifts visa requirements against citizens of all the countries which also lift visa requirements against its own citizens, unless a prior bilateral agreement has been made.|$|E

25|$|According to {{a report}} from April 2015, the Commission {{dismissed}} notifications by both Bulgaria and Romania of a general <b>visa</b> <b>requirement</b> by Australia. It concluded that the Australian electronic visa 'manual processing' treatment {{should not be considered}} as equivalent to the Schengen visa application procedures and consequently will not be covered by the reciprocity mechanism. In its previous report, the Commission also committed to assessing certain provisions of the US electronic visa system â€” such as the application fee.|$|E

25|$|Saudi Arabia and Qatar have an exit <b>visa</b> <b>requirement,</b> {{particularly}} for foreign workers. This {{is part of}} the kafala system, also present in Lebanon, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Kuwait, and Oman. Consequently, {{at the end of a}} foreign worker's employment period, the worker must secure clearance from their employer stating that the worker has satisfactorily fulfilled the terms of their employment contract or that the worker's services are no longer needed. The exit visa can also be withheld if there are pending court charges that need to be settled or penalties that have to be meted out.|$|E
25|$|The United States Department of Homeland Security {{extended}} {{the scope of}} the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act. , visa waivers do not apply where a person has previously traveled to Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen on or after 1 March 2011 or for those who remain nationals of Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria in addition to the nationality that would otherwise entitle them to a visa waiver. Instead, they are now required to go through the process to obtain a visa. Certain categories such as diplomats, military, journalists, humanitarian workers or legitimate businessmen may have their <b>visa</b> <b>requirement</b> waived by the Secretary of Homeland Security.|$|E
25|$|In October 2014, the British and Irish governments {{signed a}} {{memorandum}} of understanding {{paving the way for}} mutually recognised visas allowing visitors to travel to Britain and Ireland on a single visa.

Subject to a review in 2015, it is proposed to extend the system to all countries by the end of that year. The system will replace the Irish visa waiver programme which currently waives the <b>visa</b> <b>requirement</b> for the nationals of 18 countries if they hold valid UK short-stay visas and enter Ireland directly from the UK.|$|E

25|$|At many {{external}} border crossing points, there are special lanes for EU, EEA and Swiss citizens (as {{well as their}} family members) and other lanes for all travellers regardless of nationality. At some {{external border}} crossing points, {{there is a third}} type of lane for travellers who are Annex II nationals (i.e. non-EU/EEA/Swiss citizens who are exempt from the <b>visa</b> <b>requirement).</b> Although Andorran and San Marinese citizens are not EU or EEA citizens, they are nonetheless able to use the special lanes designated for EU, EEA and Swiss citizens.

25|$|In October 2014, it was {{reported}} that the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the European Union might not be ratified by Bulgaria and Romania unless the <b>visa</b> <b>requirement</b> was lifted for their citizens by Canada. Under Canadian legislation, for a country {{to be added to the}} visa waiver list there should be less than 3% immigration violations and visa refusal rate of less than 3% over 3 years. For Bulgarians the immigration violation rate was 4.4% in 2013 and the average 3 year visa refusal rate was 15.76%. For Romanians the immigration violation rate was 2.7% in 2013 and the average 3 year visa refusal rate was 15%. Even though the thresholds are not absolute, Canadian authorities notified the EU that political manoeuvre is not possible when the difference between the threshold and rates is too big.|$|E
25|$|Mingling of {{visitors}} from many countries, {{some of which}} have poor health care systems still plagued by preventable infectious diseases, can lead to the spread of epidemics. If an outbreak were to occur on the road to Mecca, pilgrims could exacerbate the problem when they returned home and passed their infection on to others. This was more of a problem in the past. One such disease, which has prompted response from the Saudi government, is meningitis as it became a primary concern after an international outbreak following the Hajj in 1987. Due to post-Hajj outbreaks globally of certain types of meningitis in previous years, it is now a <b>visa</b> <b>requirement</b> to be immunised with the ACW135Y vaccine before arrival. Every year, the Saudi government publishes a list of required vaccines for pilgrims, which for 2010 also included yellow fever, polio, and influenza.|$|E
