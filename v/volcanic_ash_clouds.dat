No single system can give a comprehensive description of eruptive activity, and so, a multi-sensor approach is required. This work integrates infrared and microwave <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> retrievals obtained from the geostationary Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) -Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), the polar-orbiting Aqua-MODIS and ground-based weather radar. The expected outcomes are improvements in satellite <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> <b>cloud</b> retrieval (altitude, mass, aerosol optical depth and effective radius), the generation of new satellite products (ash concentration and particle number density in the thermal infrared) and better characterization of volcanic eruptions (plume altitude, total ash mass erupted and particle number density from thermal infrared to microwave). This approach is the core of the multi-platform <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> <b>cloud</b> estimation procedure being developed within the European FP 7 -APhoRISM project. The Mt.

The improvement of the <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> <b>cloud</b> altitude leads to a mean difference between the SEVIRI ash mass estimations, before and after the integration, of about the 30 %. Moreover, the percentage of the airborne “fine” ash retrieved from the satellite is estimated to be about 1 %– 2 % of the total ash emitted during the eruption.

5000|$|A {{series of}} short {{volcanic}} eruptions on a nearly daily basis took place starting December 20, 2016, producing towering <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> <b>clouds</b> and volcanic lightning, changing {{the geography of}} the island. As there are no cameras or monitoring stations {{on the island and}} the area is usually overcast, details were uncertain. However, when the weather became favorable, it was seen that a small vent slightly offshore of Bogoslof's northeast beach had erupted explosively, fracturing the original island in two, and forming a new, smaller island to the northeast. Satellite images of the island showed that by December 25, 2016, the island had fractured into three smaller islands centered on what was thought to be the active vent of the eruption, gaining a net 1.2 acre, compared to its previous area of 71.2 acre. Bogoslof continued to grow in the following weeks, reaching a size of 108.0 acre on January 11, 2017, and merging again into a single island. As of March 11, 2017, Bogoslof is 242 acre in size, having more than tripled in size, and forming into a large circular island around the central vent, and will likely continue to grow. A significant explosive eruption began at Bogoslof volcano at 02:08 UTC on 20 February (17:08 AKST on 19 February). Seismic and infrasound data show a series of short-lived explosive pulses through 02:45 UTC; seismicity has decreased slightly since then. Recent satellite images show a cloud as high as 25,000 ft asl. [...] A May 17 eruption sent ash 34,000 feet into the atmosphere.

40|$|To make {{accurate}} {{volcanic ash}} cloud dispersion forecasts, certain parameters, including the altitude of the volcanic cloud, must be known. There are several methods used for estimating the height of an ash cloud, including correlation with ground-based video, correlation with wind data, cloud-shadow geometry, and the space-borne “ 11 µm brightness temperature” technique. We introduce the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) “CO 2 -slicing ” technique as a method for retrieving volcanic cloud heights from space. This paper compares the heights retrieved from the CO 2 -slicing method with heights estimated by the aforementioned methodologies, as well as height products from the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR).

40|$|The {{forecast}} accuracy of distal <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> <b>clouds</b> {{is important for}} providing valid aviation advice during volcanic ash eruption. However, because the distal part of volcanic ash plume {{is far from the}} volcano, the influence of eruption information on this part becomes rather indirect and uncertain, resulting in inaccurate volcanic ash forecasts in these distal areas. In our approach, we use real-life aircraft in situ observations, measured in the northwestern part of Germany during the 2010  Eyjafjallajökull eruption, in an ensemble-based data assimilation system combined with a volcanic ash transport model to investigate the potential improvement on the {{forecast accuracy}} with regard to the distal volcanic ash plume.
