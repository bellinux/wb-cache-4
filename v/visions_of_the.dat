It telepathically invades Dr. Okun's mind and uses his vocal cords {{to communicate with}} Thomas before launching a psychic attack against him. Thomas sees <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aliens' plans: their entire civilization travels from planet to planet, exterminating all indigenous life and harvesting the planet of all natural resources. After Secret Service agents and military personnel kill the alien, Thomas reluctantly authorizes a nuclear attack; a B-2 Spirit fires a nuclear warhead tipped cruise missile at a saucer positioned above Houston, but the saucer remains intact.|$|E

5|$|A {{man with}} a tattooed tree {{on his chest and}} back is {{introduced}} in the opening minutes of Carnivàles pilot episode, and appears in many other Avataric visions and dreams: in Ben's and Brother Justin's common recurring dreams chasing Henry Scudder in a cornfield, in Ben's microsleep-like visions, in Sofie's <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rape of her mother, and in an extended vision of Brother Justin foreshadowing his dark future. Ben encounters a little boy with a similar tree painted to his chest and back late in Season 1. Brother Justin finds this tree grown on a hill early in Season 2, which prompts him to get his chest and back tattooed accordingly. The tree is also depicted in the show's Gospel of Matthias book, in a painting at the Templar Hall in Loving, New Mexico, and on many images in the room of Templar chaplain Kerrigan. Management and Wilfred Talbot Smith imply the tree's significance for the resolution of Carnivàle.|$|E

He finds that his access to their old computer systems still works, and learns that they may know the whereabouts of his daughter Jordan. Spurred on by several momentary encounters with similarly demonic beings, Black returns to his home town of Seattle, Washington. As he visits the grave of his wife Catherine, he is tranquilised and apprehended by Group members. Waking in captivity, he learns that they seek his help against the same demonic forces he has been encountering—and that Jordan is now a willing initiate of the Group. She has now begun to powerfully manifest <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> future, similar to Black's ability to see the past through others' eyes.|$|E
5|$|Boyer {{observes the}} {{distinction}} between how nonhuman animals can receive political protection {{as individuals and as}} species. He argues that the latter form of protection is motivated by a desire to preserve human experience of the species rather than the experiences of the nonhuman animals themselves. Politically motivated species advocacy, Boyer argues, is highly anthropocentric, as advocates present these animals as sharing in particular revered virtues; as a result, the likes of habitat and genetic health are the focus of advocates, rather than the nonhuman animals themselves. Using the example of polar bear preservation, Boyer illustrates how species advocacy becomes tied up with broader political goals concerning humans and competing <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value of animals. He concludes that the advancement of species advocacy can limit the achievement of animal welfare/rights goals.|$|E

5|$|During {{the events}} of the first tournament, Raiden sees <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> future due to the message he received. Raiden concludes that Liu Kang must win the tournament to save Earthrealm. During the tournament, Liu Kang becomes the only {{remaining}} Earthrealm contender, due in part to Scorpion's murder of Bi-Han, in retaliation for the latter's murder of the Shirai Ryu clan some years earlier. Liu Kang is successful in defeating the Shokan Prince Goro, as well as Shang Tsung. Raiden's amulet, however, cracks, a sign that future events are unchanged. Disappointed with the sorcerer's failure, emperor Shao Kahn orders Shang Tsung's execution, but is convinced otherwise when the sorcerer suggests holding the second tournament in Outworld. Though initially refusing, Raiden relents when tarkatans invade Earth and Shang Tsung threatens to unleash all of Outworld's armies upon Earthrealm.|$|E

Three weeks after arriving, Adi Da said that <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin Mary (that he interpreted as a personification of divine feminine power, or shakti) directed {{him to make a}} pilgrimage to Christian holy sites.

5|$|The World Before the Flood is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1828 and {{currently in the}} Southampton City Art Gallery. It depicts a scene from John Milton's Paradise Lost in which, among a series of <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> future shown to Adam, he sees the world immediately before the Great Flood. The painting illustrates the stages of courtship as described by Milton; {{a group of men}} select wives from a group of dancing women, drag their chosen woman from the group, and settle down to married life. Behind the courting group, an oncoming storm looms, a symbol of the destruction which the dancers and lovers are about to bring upon themselves.|$|E

5|$|Alex and {{the group}} {{discover}} Maggie Adler's plan to fix the temporal tears—transposing onto {{the other side and}} tuning within. Alex repeatedly has <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, including talking with Michael. Alex and Jonas head to a lookout post to unlock a bomb shelter to find another way into the cave. A ghost possesses Jonas and attempts to bargain with Alex, offering to spare her and the rest of her friends if they leave Clarissa behind. Inside the caves, Alex tunes into a rift that sends her into a void. Encountering the possessed Clarissa, Alex is warned that she will die if the rift is closed, but Clarissa will be kept if she goes through the portal. Alex can choose to leave, erasing Clarissa from existence; close the portal herself, trapping her with the ghosts; or, if she has found enough letters from Maggie Adler, Alex can appeal to the crew members directly, convincing them to let Clarissa and her go. The reflection of Alex seen throughout the game is revealed to be Alex from the future. She then loops back to a conversation to Michael, who admits that he and Clarissa are planning to move away from town. Time then corrects.|$|E
5|$|Following her {{resignation}} from Vector in {{the wake}} of her discoveries and the Gnosis Terrorism, Shion allies with underground group Scientia to investigate. Her former co-worker Allen takes her place looking after KOS-MOS. Meanwhile, Canaan, Jr., Jin, chaos, MOMO and Ziggy are investigating a landmass that originated from Lost Jerusalem. They are attacked by Margulis, then the landmass is swallowed with the Elsa in an inverted pocket of hyperspace. Shion meanwhile visits Allen, and sees the demonstration of two new weapons for fighting the Gnosis—T-elos, a battle robot meant to replace KOS-MOS; and Omega, a mech created from the Proto Omega's remains and piloted by Abel. After the test, T-elos' creator Roth Mantel informs Allen that KOS-MOS will be scrapped so development can focus on T-elos. As KOS-MOS's weaponry {{is the only way to}} break into the hyperspace pocket and save the Elsa, Shion leads the group into the facility and rescues KOS-MOS, guided at one point by Abel. During this time, Shion has frequent <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> girl Nephilim, and has blackouts where she is contacted by U-DO. Events are also observed by Wilhelm, who is working with the Testaments to find both Abel and Abel's Ark.|$|E

Garcian travels to Coburn Elementary School near Seattle, Washington and discovers tapes that reveal the school as a front for the UN Party to train children as assassins. The tapes focus on Emir Parkreiner, a gifted killer trained at the school. Garcian learns that Japan uses Coburn to control the vote of the US presidential election. The assassins battle a group of invincible Smiles and all but Garcian are incapacitated. Garcian travels to the Union Hotel where he witnesses <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other members being killed in their rooms.

5|$|Red Chillies Entertainment {{continued}} to work on other projects before finalising the production aspects of Ra.One. After providing the visual effects for My Name Is Khan (2010), the studio focused solely on Ra.One and did not take up any other films. Khan initially approached a number of directors to helm the film, including Aditya Chopra and Karan Johar, but they declined; eventually, Sinha was made the film's director. To prepare the film's premises and characterisation, Sinha spent several months viewing video clips, digital art portals and comic books. Sinha and Khan also watched around 200 superhero films {{from all over the}} world. The storyboards were designed by Atul Chouthmal, who was contracted after he met Khan at Yash Raj Studios. While the former began work on the storyboards, the producers hired a storyboard artist from Hollywood. Chouthmal revealed that Khan and the other artist differed on their <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film, and so he was brought back. Before filming, Khan reportedly took tips from actor Kamal Hassan regarding the production of large-scale films, having been impressed by Hassan's Dasavathaaram (2008).|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Serah is {{the only}} one who remembers Lightning being on Gran Pulse after she is taken to Valhalla, with all the others believing she sacrificed herself to save Cocoon. She {{eventually}} becomes a teacher in the village of New Bodhum, the town she and Snow help build on Gran Pulse, before it is invaded by monsters three years after the fall of Cocoon. Serah is aided by Noel Kreiss, who tells her of Lightning's fate and his own mission. After Serah accepts Noel's offer to be brought to Lightning, the two embark on a journey across time to find her sister. In the process, Serah encounters Caius Ballad, while learning from Paddra Nsu-Yeul that she possesses the same detrimental ability as her to see the future. Despite learning that she would die herself if she continues seeing <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> future, Serah resolves to change the future for everyone's sake. However, after Caius's defeat and returning to Gran Pulse five hundred years in her future, Serah has another vision and dies moments before Gran Pulse is infected by Valhalla's chaos. Serah appears to Lightning in Valhalla as a spirit, telling her she knew that she could have died from her visions but still took the risk regardless. Serah promises Lightning that they will see each other again as long as Lightning promises to remember her. In Lightning Returns, Serah's soul, which has been kept safe within Lightning, is removed and cast away by Bhunivelze. Lumina acts as a shelter for Serah's soul, resulting in the two being similar in appearance. Bhunivelze also creates a false version of Serah to keep Lightning in line. This false Serah, who develops feelings for her 'sister' arrives when Lightning intends to become the protector of the new world and persuades her to accept her vulnerabilities and call for aid. The real Serah reunites with Lightning and her allies, and travels with them to the new world.|$|E

40|$|Given {{previous}} {{reports of}} strong interactions between vision and somatic senses, we investigated whether <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body modulates pain perception.
