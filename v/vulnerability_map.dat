50|$|Disaster risk {{management}} {{was able to}} strengthen the partnership of the Philippines and Australia. The Australian Government introduced two projects that would enhance the capability of the Philippines to withstand climate change and natural disasters. The Australian Government has provided monitory help to strengthen {{the capacity of the}} Philippine technical agencies in assessing preventive measures and actions. Australia also contributed Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology to help the Philippines assess its vulnerability and prepare for future calamities. Also, Australia has collaborated with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in helping the Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) develop a <b>vulnerability</b> <b>map</b> of Metro Manila. The Philippines-Australia Community Assistance Program has created the Microfinance Technokit which guides development organizations on how to properly manage microfinance projects. It also aims to help non-government organizations (NGOs) and communities in developing their own projects. Another is the Proceedings of the National Forum on Community Development which is a collection of best practices from the Program and fellow NGOs. It assisted community-initiated development efforts and focuses on improving the economic development of rural areas. These programs support Australia's goal of helping the Philippines realize its economic potential.|$|E

The vulnerability assessment was validated by means of tracing tests, hydrological, hydrochemical and isotope methods. The hazard map shows the localization of potential contamination sources resulting from human activities, and evaluates those according to their dangerousness. The risk of groundwater contamination depends on the hazards and the vulnerability of the aquifer system.

40|$|Several faults {{exist in}} the {{vicinity}} of Tehran, the capital of Iran such as North Tehran, Ray, Mosha and Kahrizak. One way to assist reducing the damage caused by the earthquake is the production of a seismic <b>vulnerability</b> <b>map.</b> The study area in this research is Tehran, based on the assumption of the activation of North Tehran fault. Degree of Physical seismic vulnerability caused by the earthquake depends on a number of criteria. In this study the intensity of the earthquake, land slope, numbers of buildings’ floors as well as their materials are considered as the effective parameters. Hence, the production of the seismic <b>vulnerability</b> <b>map</b> is a multi criteria issue. In this problem, the main source of uncertainty is related to the experts’ opinions regarding the seismic vulnerability of Tehran statistical units. The main objectives of this study are to exploit opinions of the experts, undertaking interval computation and interval Dempster-Shafer combination rule to reduce the uncertainty in the opinions of the experts and customizing granular computing to extract the rules and to produce Tehran physical seismic <b>vulnerability</b> <b>map</b> with a higher confidence.

40|$|Maps {{illustrating}} the {{different degrees of}} vulnerability within a given area are integral to environmental protection and management policies. The assessment of the intrinsic vulnerability of karst areas is difficult since the type and stage of karst development and the related underground discharge behavior are difficult to determine and quantify. Geographic Information Systems techniques are applied to {{the evaluation of the}} vulnerability of an aquifer in the alpine karst area of the Sette Comuni Plateau, in the Veneto Region of northern Italy. The water resources of the studied aquifer are of particular importance to the local communities. This aquifer must therefore be protected from both inappropriate use as well as possible pollution.

40|$|Groundwater is {{the main}} source of water in arid and {{semi-arid}} regions. Therefore, pollution of groundwater is a major issue because aquifers and the contained groundwater are inherently susceptible to contamination from wastewater and agricultural activities. Aquifer vulnerability has been assessed in the Sana’a basin using the DRASTIC method, based on a Geographic Information System (GIS). The DRASTIC model uses seven environmental parameters (Depth to water, net Recharge, Aquifer media, Soil media, Topography, Impact of vadose zone, and hydraulic Conductivity) to characterize the hydrogeological setting and evaluate aquifer vulnerability. A regional scale aquifer <b>vulnerability</b> <b>map</b> of the basin was prepared using overlay analysis with the aid of GIS.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to facilitate a sustainable regional planning of water resources in karst areas by providing a conceptual framework for an integrative vulnerability assessment.

The approach is illustrated at a field site in northwest Switzerland (Gempen plateau).

40|$|Soil {{samples from}} 31 {{locations}} in the Una river spring catchment were subject to chemical extraction analyses. The data were presented as distribution maps of potentially toxic elements (Al, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn) in the surface soil of the area. To evaluate {{the vulnerability of the}} immediate spring zone of the karst catchment, the <b>vulnerability</b> <b>map</b> was derived from the application of the PI methodology proposed by the European COST Action 620. The PI method used to produce the <b>vulnerability</b> <b>map</b> takes into account the protective cover (P) and the infiltration conditions (I). It is based on the origin-pathway-target model. The π-factor (π = P ´ I) describes the vulnerability in the area, subdivided into 5 classes: π-factor in the range 0 - 1 implies an area of extreme vulnerability, while π-factor in the range 4 - 5 implies an area of very low vulnerability. The extraction procedure for the elements Al, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn, has been applied {{in order to determine the}} potential mobility and redistribution of elements that could influence the groundwater and affect its quality. The applied extraction was the second step of the sequential procedure proposed by TESSIER et al. (1979), i. e. extraction with 1 mol dm- 3 CH 3 COONa/CH 3 COOH buffer (pH 5). The results provide information on the potential mobility of the studied elements, indicating the possibility of their mobilization through changes in pH. Lead shows the greatest amount of mobility, with a mean of 9 % (max. 16 %) extracted under an acidic condition. Manganese follows with a mean of 5 % (max. 11 %) and zinc, copper and aluminium show less than 1 % (mean) mobility. The <b>vulnerability</b> <b>map</b> of the karst area was produced in order to predict potential problem areas of karst aquifers. The Una spring catchment area presents generally low to moderate vulnerability; 8 % of the studied area can be considered as extremely vulnerable according to the PI-methodology. Based on these data it was possible to delineate areas with a low protection cover i. e. combining the <b>vulnerability</b> <b>map</b> of the karst area with the distribution maps of potentially toxic elements, areas considered extremely vulnerable could be identified. </p...|$|E

The test site is characterised by high water table fluctuations, manifested in intermittent lakes and variable drainage divides. A first multi-tracer test (two injections) allowed subdivision of the catchment into zones of different degrees of contribution (‘inner zone’ and ‘outer zone’). For <b>vulnerability</b> <b>mapping,</b> only methods that consider the specific nature of karst aquifers such as heterogeneity and duality of infiltration processes, were selected: EPIK, PI, the ‘Simplified Method’ and the ‘Slovene Approach’. For validation, a second multi-tracer test (four injections) was carried out. The time of first detection and the normalised recovery were used as validation criteria. The results suggest that EPIK and the Simplified Method sometimes overestimate vulnerability, while PI and the Slovene Approach tend to deliver more realistic results, at least during low-flow conditions. The Slovene Approach gives the clearest guidance {{on how to deal}} with hydrologic variability, for example by assigning lower vulnerability to occasionally active sinking surface waters than to permanent ones.
