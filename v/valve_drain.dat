40|$|Abstract: The paper aims to {{highlight}} the pressure and velocity variations on power lines created by water flowing through a cylindrical <b>valve.</b> <b>Drain</b> valve is typical cylindrical bottom of the dam or hydroelectric penstocks. Varieties of dimensions of these valves allow different analyses of the dynamics within them. The valves are able to access water from both sides and different ways of filling and closing action items. This paper presents a method to analyse the influence of parameters on physical-mechanical construction or operation and hence derive dynamic optimal design {{of these types of}} valves. Refer to the more intermediate positions of the piston sealing and visualization power lines and areas of turbulence for each position. Flow simulation allows for three power lines recording the flow velocity values then are the velocity and pressure variations in nine distinct points on each line current. Cylindrical valve characteristics Being performed {{in a wide range of}} sizes, cylinder valve has been tested only on hydraulic losses experimental methods to flow and seal leaked. A dynamic analysis for different valve openings or changes in hydrodynamic parameters under these conditions can give us additional elements on how best to use or design of the valve. Cylinder valve or valve Johnson, named after its inventor...|$|E
30|$|The test {{facility}} consisted of mixer-viscometer, a gas addition system, a cooling system, a liquid charge system, cleaning solvent charge systems, and a data acquisition system. The gas charging system {{consisted of a}} pressurized gas bottle (usually 1800 psi), a pressure regulator, gas cooling bath and a mass flow meter. Operating pressure was preset using the pressure regulator. The gas through the preset pressure regulator was routed through an ice bath to cool it before it was metered. A Porter series 200 mass flowmeter was used to meter the flow rate and total volume of gas added to the vessel. The liquid charging system consisted of a simple funnel through which liquids {{were added to the}} vessel. The liquid charge could also be done using the cleaning system especially if it was desired to add liquid when the vessel was already pressurized. The cleaning and venting system consisted of a pump, bottom <b>valve,</b> <b>drain</b> trough and a vent. The pump could be used to draw liquid from the selected tank and send it to the vessel. The liquid could be a reactant or just cleaning solvent. The bottom valve was used to let in liquids into the vessel or drain from it. The drain trough was used to collect wastes after the experiments. The cooling system consisted of a chiller, the gas temperature control bath and a cooling jacket. The chiller was used to heat, cool or maintain temperature of the vessel contents. The gas temperature bath was intended to pre-cool the gas on hot days when the ambient temperatures were extremely high. The cooling jacket was the main heat exchange point between the chiller and the vessel contents. The shaft magnetic coupling was cooled to prevent heating due to friction. The mixing system consisted of a motor drive, torque sensor, and impeller. The vessel was 3.25 ″ internal diameter, 10 ″ height and rated for a maximum working pressure of 3000 psi. It was equipped with gas inlet and outlet valves, a sampling/drain valve at the bottom, pressure gage, safety/relief valve, and internal thermocouple. A ¼ HP variable speed motor was used to rotate the mixing shaft from 0 to 1900  rpm. A rotary shaft non-contact torque sensor model 01424 was used to measure torque directly from the shaft. A helical-blade impeller with two ¼ pitch blades was used for mixing vessel contents. The helical blades impeller was found to be more sensitive to viscosity change and hydrate formation during the trial tests. It also reduces the formation of a vortex during mixing. The process control and data acquisition system was developed using Factory Talk integrated suite software from Rockwell Automation. The recorded variables were shaft rotational speed, torque on shaft, chiller temperature, gas bath temperature, vessel temperature, vessel pressure, gas injection rate and totalized gas volume. A detailed description of the design, mathematical models, and calibration for this mixer-viscometer is published elsewhere (Bbosa 2015; Bbosa et al. 2017) Fig.  8 shows the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) for the setup. Figure  9 shows the schematic of the in-house mixer-viscometer used in characterization of hydrate slurries. Figure  10 shows the small-scale facility setup.|$|E

The analysis process is a risk-based uncertainty analysis where each variable is modeled using available information and engineering judgement. The uncertainty associated with each variable is represented by a probability distribution (probability density function). Uncertainty exists because of the inherent randomness associated with the distribution of values that a variable may assume, and {{because of a lack of}} knowledge concerning a variable. Engineering judgement and technical information are used to develop the variable probability density functions, but the bounds of the probability density function are based on physical limitations. The uncertainty, described by probability distributions, is propagated through the analysis by Monte Carlo convolution techniques. The corresponding results are developed as a probability distribution and expressed in terms of the corresponding complementary cumulative distribution function (''risk curve'') ...|$|R

50|$|A well-conceived utility structure, the North Pine Pumping Station is a {{small scale}} {{industrial}} building designed to accommodate the operations for water pumping.

In its essential elements, the station follows the standard design principles for pumping stations. It presents from the road as a single storey building with {{the bulk of the}} structure housed below. The intake pumps are located below river level and draw water into the mains for pumping through a series of pipes and valves to the water treatment plant. The basement contains the main plant for the pumping operations including pipes, <b>valves,</b> <b>drains,</b> pits and motors.

40|$|Bacterial {{adhesion}} is {{a crucial}} factor in the pathogenicity of numerous bacterial species. This property plays such a great role in infections of foreign material that removal of the material is the only effective therapy. The electron microscopy studies performed by Christensen have demonstrated that infected foreign material harbors bacteria which are often coated with slime and therefore escape detection by conventional microbiological methods. in view of these properties, enzymatic or physical detachment of adherent bacteria was attempted. 231 specimens {{from a variety of}} materials (catheters, heart <b>valves,</b> <b>drains,</b> bone biopsies) which yielded negative results after 15 days culture in Schaedler medium were either exposed to trypsin or sonicated. Among catheter specimens, 44. 7 % yielded positive bacteriologic results; pathogens recovered included 8. 3 % micrococci, 5. 1 % nongroupable streptococci, 1. 7 % group D streptococci, 2. 9 % Enterobacteria, and 23. 3 % coagulase-negative staphylococci. Among the bone specimens, the improvement in yield was 64. 7 %; except in one case, the pathogens recovered were consistent with previously initiated treatments. This bacterial detachment method should be studied in a larger number of specimens to determine its diagnostic value as compared with conventional techniques...|$|R
40|$|The <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> {{located in}} the bottom of the K-West Basin South Loadout Pit (SLOP) could provide an {{additional}} leak path from the K Basins if the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> were damaged during construction, installation, or operation of the cask loading system. For the K-West Basin SLOP the immersion pail support structure (IPSS) has already been installed, but the immersion pail has not been installed in the IPSS. The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the risk of damaging the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> during the remaining installation activities or operation of the cask loading system. Valve damage, as used in this analysis, does not necessarily imply large amounts of the water will be released quickly from the basin, rather valve damage implies that the valve's integrity has been compromised. The analysis process is a risk-based uncertainty analysis where best engineering judgement is used to represent each variable in the analysis. The uncertainty associated with each variable is represented by a probability distribution. The uncertainty is propagated through the analysis by Monte Carlo convolution techniques. The corresponding results are developed as a probability distribution and the risk is expressed in terms of the corresponding complementary cumulative distribution function (''risk curve''). The total risk is the area under the ''risk curve''. The risk of potentially dropping a cask into or on the IPSS and damaging the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> is approximately 1 x 10 {sup - 4 } to 2 x 10 {sup - 5 } per year. The risk of objects falling behind the IPSS and damaging the valve is 3 x 10 {sup - 2 } to 6 x 10 {sup - 3 } per year. Both risks are expressed as drain value failure frequencies. The risk of objects falling behind the IPSS and damaging the valve can be significantly reduced by an impact limiter and/or installing a gating or plate over the area bounded by the back of the IPSS and the wall of the SLOP. With either of these actions there is a 90 percent confidence that the frequency of <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> failure would be less than 1 x 10 {sup - 6 } per year...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the type}} of waterhammer that kills people. It's {{initiating}} mechanism is much different than the image most engineers have of what causes waterhammer [...] i. e. fast moving steam picking up a slug of condensate and hurling it downstream against an elbow or a valve. Condensation Induced Waterhammer can be 100 times more powerful than this type of waterhammer. Because it does not require flowing steam, it often occurs during relatively quiescent periods when operators least expect it. It's most often initiated by opening a <b>valve,</b> even a <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> to remove condensate. The overpressure from an event can easily exceed 1000 psi. This is enough pressure to fracture a cast iron valve, blow out a steam gasket, or burst an accordion type expansion joint. And, in fact, failure of each of these components in separate condensation induced waterhammer accidents has resulted in operator fatalities. Operators and engineers need to understand this type of waterhammer so they can avoid procedures which can initiate it and designs which are susceptible to it...|$|R
