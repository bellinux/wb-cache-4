A series of rapidly applied developments, brought about by wartime needs, markedly improved the engine's performance and durability. Starting at 1,000hp for the first production models, most late war versions produced just under 1,800hp, and the <b>very</b> <b>latest</b> version as used in the de Havilland Hornet over 2,000hp.

It was clearly emphasised from without that the two main floors of the house were purely for state and family use, and the staff and service areas were confined to the semi-basement and attic floors. This concept of keeping staff and domestic matters out of sight (when not required) was relatively new and had first been employed by Pratt in the design of Coleshill House in Berkshire.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} differences in treatment and in-hospital mortality of early, <b>late,</b> and <b>very</b> <b>late</b> stent thrombosis (ST). BackgroundEarly, <b>late,</b> and <b>very</b> <b>late</b> ST may differ in clinical presentation, management, and in-hospital outcomes. MethodsWe analyzed definite (angiographically documented) ST cases identified from February 2009 to June 2010 in the CathPCI Registry. We stratified events by timing of presentation: early (≤ 1 month), late (1 to 12 months), or <b>very</b> <b>late</b> (≥ 12 months) following stent implantation. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was performed to compare in-hospital mortality for each type of ST after adjusting for baseline comorbidities. ResultsDuring the study period, 7, 315 ST events were identified in 7, 079 of 401, 662 patients (1. 8 %) presenting with acute coronary syndromes. This ST cohort consisted of 1, 391 patients with early ST (19. 6 %), 1, 370 with late ST (19. 4 %), and 4, 318 with <b>very</b> <b>late</b> ST (61. 0 %). Subjects with early ST had a higher prevalence of black race and diabetes, whereas subjects with <b>very</b> <b>late</b> ST had a higher prevalence of white race and a lower prevalence of prior myocardial infarction or diabetes. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in early ST (7. 9 %) compared with late (3. 8 %) and <b>very</b> <b>late</b> ST (3. 6 %, p < 0. 001). This lower mortality for <b>late</b> and <b>very</b> <b>late</b> ST persisted after multivariable adjustment (odds ratio: 0. 53 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 36 to 0. 79] and 0. 58 [95 % CI: 0. 43 to 0. 79], respectively). ConclusionsSignificant differences exist in the presentation and outcomes of early, <b>late,</b> and <b>very</b> <b>late</b> ST. Among patients with acute coronary syndromes who are undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for angiographically documented ST, early ST is associated with the highest in-hospital mortality...|$|R

40|$|Eighteen {{genes of}} Autographa californica {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} are {{necessary}} and sufficient to transactivate expression from the late vp 39 promoter in transient-expression assays in SF- 21 cells. These 18 genes, known as late expression factor genes (lefs), are also required to transactivate the <b>very</b> <b>late</b> promoter of the polyhedrin gene, polh, but expression from this promoter is relatively weak compared with expression from the vp 39 promoter. To further define the factors required for <b>late</b> and <b>very</b> <b>late</b> promoter expression, we first determined that the eighteen lefs were also required for expression from two other major baculovirus promoters: the late basic 6. 9 -kDa protein gene, p 6. 9, and the <b>very</b> <b>late</b> 10 -kDa protein gene, p 10. We next examined {{the effect of the}} <b>very</b> <b>late</b> expression factor 1 gene (vlf- 1), a gene previously identified by analysis of a temperature-sensitive mutant, in the transient expression assay and found that vlf- 1 specifically transactivated the two <b>very</b> <b>late</b> promoters but not the two late promoters. We then surveyed the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus genome for additional genes which might specifically regulate <b>very</b> <b>late</b> gene expression; no additional vlf genes were detected, suggesting that VLF- 1 is the primary regulator of <b>very</b> <b>late</b> gene expression. Finally, we found that the relative contribution of the antiapoptosis gene p 35, which behaves as a lef in these transient-expression assays, depended {{on the nature of the}} other viral genes provided in the cotransfection mixtures, suggesting that other viral genes also contribute to the ability of the virus to block apoptosis...|$|R

This alliance then attacked a disunited and war weakened Assyria, and between 616 BC and 599 BC at the <b>very</b> <b>latest,</b> had conquered its vast empire which stretched from the Caucasus Mountains to Egypt, Libya and the Arabian Peninsula, and from Cyprus and Ephesus to Persia and the Caspian Sea.|$|E
25|$|There {{are very}} few archaeological sources {{contemporaneous}} with Neferefre, a fact which is now seen by Egyptologists, including Miroslav Verner, to witness a very short reign. In particular, as of 2017, only one inscription dated to his rule is known. It was left by the builders of his pyramid on a corner block {{at the end of}} the corridor leading down to the pyramid substructures. The inscription was written on the fourth day of the Akhet season in the year of first occurrence of the cattle count, an event consisting of counting the livestock throughout the country to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied. It is traditionally believed that such counts occurred every two years during the Old Kingdom although recent reappraisals have led Egyptologists to posit a less regular and somewhat more frequent count. Therefore, the inscription is likely to refer to Neferefre's first or second year on the throne, and his third year at the <b>very</b> <b>latest.</b> Finally, a few artefacts dated to Neferefre's rule or shortly after have been uncovered in his mortuary complex and elsewhere in Abusir, such a clay seals bearing his Horus name.|$|E
25|$|Cameron's generalship in New Zealand was, {{with minor}} exceptions, {{of a very}} high standard. In particular, he was a general who welcomed new ideas and {{technology}} and quickly put them into action. Cameron ordered prefabricated, steel-clad gunboats from Australia, which were assembled and finished in New Zealand. Both the gunboats and the army were equipped with the <b>very</b> <b>latest</b> Armstrong artillery, which were light, mobile, very accurate and fired an explosive shell. He appreciated the importance of irregular troops and allowed {{the creation of the}} Forest Rangers, who had their own unique organisation, uniform and lightweight arms including Bowie knives, revolvers and breech-loading carbines. In 1862, the telegram was first introduced to New Zealand, 18 years after its invention by Morse, and in 1863 a military telegraph was built from Auckland to Drury and later extended to the Waikato, allowing rapid communication between the front and Auckland. Cameron was quick to realise the importance of local knowledge and used Gorst, a missionary from the Waikato who spoke the Māori language, as a guide. He also used Waikato Māori who remained loyal to the crown as guides and to man a redoubt at Rangiriri once the Kingites had been defeated. A kūpapa Māori, familiar with the shallow waters of the Waikato Heads was used to guide the first gunboats through the Waikato River shoals. Cameron appreciated the importance of the surface coal seams at Huntly, which he used as fuel for his gunboats and supply steamers.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Stent {{thrombosis}} (ST) {{in clinical}} practice {{can be classified}} according to time of onset as early (0 – 30 days after stent implantation), which is further divided into acute (30 days) and <b>very</b> <b>late</b> (> 12 months). Myocardial reinfaction due to <b>very</b> <b>late</b> ST in a patient receiving antithrombotic therapy is very rare, and potentially fatal. The procedure alone and related mechanical factors seem {{to be associated with}} acute/subacute ST. On the other hand, in-stent neoathero-sclerosis, inflammation, premature cessation of antiplatelet therapy, as well as stent fracture, stent malapposition, un-covered stent struts may play role in late/very late ST. Some findings implicate that the etiology of <b>very</b> <b>late</b> ST of bare-metal stent (BMS) is quite different from those following drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. Case report. We presented a 56 -year old male with acute inferoposterior ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) related to <b>very</b> <b>late</b> stent thrombosis, 9 years after BMS implantation, despite antithrombotic therapy. Thrombus aspiration was successfully performed followed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with implantation of DES into the pre-viously implanted two stents to solve the in-stent restenosis. Conclusion. <b>Very</b> <b>late</b> stent thrombosis, although fortu-nately very rare, not completely understood, might cause myocardial reinfaction, but could be successfully treated with thrombus aspiration followed by primary PCI. <b>Very</b> <b>late</b> ST in the presented patient might be connected with neointimal plaque rupture, followed by thrombotic events...|$|R

After this, in the fourth attack, he conquered the city. He completed his victory over the Hyksos by conquering their stronghold Sharuhen near Gaza after a three-year siege.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Stent {{thrombosis}} {{may occur}} late after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation, and its cause remains unknown. The present study investigated differences of the stented segment between patients {{with and without}} <b>very</b> <b>late</b> stent thrombosis {{with the use of}} intravascular ultrasound. METHODS AND RESULTS: Since January 2004, patients presenting with <b>very</b> <b>late</b> stent thrombosis (> 1 year) after DES implantation underwent intravascular ultrasound. Findings in patients with <b>very</b> <b>late</b> stent thrombosis were compared with intravascular ultrasound routinely obtained 8 months after DES implantation in 144 control patients, who did not experience stent thrombosis for > or = 2 years. <b>Very</b> <b>late</b> stent thrombosis was encountered in 13 patients at a mean of 630 +/- 166 days after DES implantation. Compared with DES controls, patients with <b>very</b> <b>late</b> stent thrombosis had longer lesions (23. 9 +/- 16. 0 versus 13. 3 +/- 7. 9 mm; P< 0. 001) and stents (34. 6 +/- 22. 4 versus 18. 6 +/- 9. 5 mm; P< 0. 001), more stents per lesion (1. 6 +/- 0. 9 versus 1. 1 +/- 0. 4; P< 0. 001), and stent overlap (39 % versus 8 %; P< 0. 001). Vessel cross-sectional area was similar for the reference segment (cross-sectional area of the external elastic membrane: 18. 9 +/- 6. 9 versus 20. 4 +/- 7. 2 mm 2; P= 0. 46) but significantly larger for the in-stent segment (28. 6 +/- 11. 9 versus 20. 1 +/- 6. 7 mm 2; P= 0. 03) in <b>very</b> <b>late</b> stent thrombosis patients compared with DES controls. Incomplete stent apposition was more frequent (77 % versus 12 %; P< 0. 001) and maximal incomplete stent apposition area was larger (8. 3 +/- 7. 5 versus 4. 0 +/- 3. 8 mm 2; P= 0. 03) in patients with <b>very</b> <b>late</b> stent thrombosis compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete stent apposition is highly prevalent in patients with <b>very</b> <b>late</b> stent thrombosis after DES implantation, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of this adverse event...|$|R

[...] Two new wings were added in the first stage, and in the 1820s more wings were added, by this time under the direction of Benjamin Gummow. [...] The interior of the house was as lavish as the exterior, with more Gothic detailing. [...] The hangings for the state bed included [...] of purple damask and [...] of sarsenet (fine silk) trimmed with gold lace.
