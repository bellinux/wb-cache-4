It does not appear to help acute disease, but tentative evidence indicates it might help those with chronic arthritis. Steroids {{do not appear to be}} an effective treatment. NSAIDs and simple analgesics can be used to provide partial symptom relief in most cases. Methotrexate, a drug used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, has been shown to have benefit in treating inflammatory polyarthritis resulting from chikungunya, though the drug mechanism for improving <b>viral</b> <b>arthritis</b> is unclear.|$|E
40|$|NF-kB is a {{transcription}} factor {{involved in the}} control {{of a large number}} of normal cellular and organism processes, such as immune and inflammatory responses, cellular growth and apoptosis. The dysregulation of NF-kB is associated with many disease states such as AIDS and <b>viral</b> infections, <b>arthritis</b> and inflammatory diseases, cancer and also genetic disorders. In this way, targeting NF-kB could be of great interest in order to find new therapeutic agents, mainly anticancer and/or antiinflammatory compounds. Recently, psoralen derivatives able to inhibit NF-kB/DNA interactions and the related IL- 8 gene expression were identified. Several novel psoralenes have been synthesized and evaluated through EMSA assay, in order to establish a Structure-Activity Relationship and to determine the structural determinant required to inhibit the NF-kB/DNA interaction. The binding mode of the compounds has been determined combining docking and 3 D-QSAR studies: initially, 4 putative interaction sites have been identified through molecular docking approach. Then, the most plausible binding site has been selected by means of 3 D-QSAR models...|$|R

The study identified 7 species to cure skin diseases (such as itches, scabies); 5 species for antiseptic (including antibacterial); 4 species for diarrhoea; 3 species for dysentery, urinary infections, snake-bite and inflammations; 2 species for bone fracture/ dislocation, hair related problems, warts, fish poisons, night blindness, wounds/cuts/ burns, rheumatism, diabetes, jaundice, vomiting and insecticide; 1 species as laxative, <b>viral</b> fever and <b>arthritis.</b> The results are encouraging but thorough scientific scrutiny is absolutely necessary before being put into practice...|$|R
40|$|Ovine {{progressive}} pneumonia virus (OPPV) infects {{at least}} one sheep in 81 % of U.

Diagnostic tests that quantify OPPV proviral load in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) provide an additional method for identification of infected sheep and may help to further understanding of the pathogenesis of OPPV-induced disease. In this study, we compared a new OPPV real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay specific for the transmembrane region of the envelope gene (tm) with a competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) using 396 PBL samples and sera from Idaho sheep. The OPPV qPCR had a positive concordance of 96. 2 % ± 2. 3 % and a negative concordance of 97. 7 % ± 2. 5 % compared to the cELISA, with a kappa value of 0. 93, indicating excellent agreement between the two tests. In addition, the presence of tm in the three OPPV qPCR-positive and cELISA-negative sheep and in 15 sheep with different OPPV proviral loads was confirmed by cloning and sequencing. These data indicate that the OPPV qPCR {{may be used as}} a supplemental diagnostic tool for OPPV infection and for measurement of viral load in PBLs of infected sheep...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{diseases}} that {{are caused by}} avian reovirus, which includes, avian arthritis/tenosynovitis, runting-stunting syndrome, and blue wing disease in chickens. Blue wing disease affects young broiler chickens and has an average mortality rate of 10%. It causes intramuscular and subcutaneous hemorrhages and atrophy of the spleen, bursa of Fabricius, and thymus. When young chickens are experimentally infected with avian reovirus, it is spread rapidly throughout all tissues. This virus is spread most frequently in the skin and muscles, {{which is also the}} most obvious site for lesions. [...] Avian arthritis causes significant lameness in joints, specifically the hock joints. In the most severe cases, <b>viral</b> <b>arthritis</b> has caused the tendon to rupture. Chickens that have contracted runting-stunting syndrome cause a number of individuals in a flock to appear noticeably small due to its delayed growth. Diseased chicks are typically pale, dirty, wet, and may have a distending abdomen. Some individuals may display “helicopter-like” feathers in their wings and other feather abnormalities. The virus has also been shown to cause osteoporosis.|$|E

40|$|Five cases (three {{children}} {{and two young}} women) of sterile inflammatory arthritis are described, each preceded by a streptococcal infection. A throat swab from one patient grew group A, beta haemolytic streptococci, and in each case unequivocal evidence of seroreaction to streptococcal antigens was present. The long term outcome in all cases was excellent, though one patient (female, 24 years of age) required prophylactic penicillin for three months. The diagnosis of a definite recent streptococcal infection is sometimes difficult as throat swabs may be negative and the diagnostic serological reaction missed unless antibodies to multiple antigens (particularly antistreptolysin O and DNAase B) are tested. These cases may represent a reactive arthritis and should be distinguished from rheumatic fever, streptococcal septic <b>arthritis,</b> <b>viral</b> arthritides, acute rheumatic diseases such as juvenile chronic arthritis, and a monoarticular presentation of a seronegative spondyloarthropathy...|$|R
40|$|Tumour {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic cytokine that mediates apoptosis, cell proliferation, immunomodulation, inflammation, <b>viral</b> replication, allergy, <b>arthritis,</b> septic shock, insulin resistance, autoimmune diseases, {{and other}} pathological conditions.

At the cellular level, these receptors activate the pathways leading to the activation of transcription factors NF-κB and AP- 1, apoptosis and proliferation, and mitogen activated protein kinases. None of these receptors exhibit any enzymatic activity but the signals are transmitted through the recruitment {{of more than a dozen}} different signalling proteins, which together form signalling cascades.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To gain {{information}} concerning the association between parvovirus B 19 infection and arthritis. METHODS [...] Blood or synovial fluid, or both, from a total of 77 adult patients with various arthropathies (rheumatoid arthritis 13; mechanical arthropathies 11; crystal induced arthritis 13; idiopathic mono/oligoarthritis 25; suspicion of <b>viral</b> <b>arthritis</b> 15) were tested {{for the presence of}} the viral genome and anti-B 19 antibodies. B 19 DNA in blood and synovial fluid was investigated by nested polymerase chain reaction, and anti-B 19 IgM and IgG antibodies were detected in blood by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS [...] A recent parvovirus infection was documented by the presence of anti-B 19 IgM antibodies in the blood of 13 patients. B 19 DNA, together with anti-B 19 IgM and IgG antibodies, were detected in the blood of seven patients who had an acute transient arthritis, putatively of viral origin. Viral DNA was detected in a synovial fluid sample and in the blood of one patient with monoarthritis who had an anti-B 19 IgG response only. CONCLUSIONS [...] The prevalence of anti-B 19 IgG antibody in these patients with various forms of arthritis (63 %) was within the same range as that in the general population (blood donors). However, for the patients with clinical suspicion of <b>viral</b> <b>arthritis,</b> the increased seroprevalence of anti-B 19 IgM and the presence of the B 19 genome point to an association between human parvovirus infections and acute forms of arthritis...|$|E

Recently, low-molecular-weight compounds able to interact with the DNA binding region of NFkB, thus inhibiting NF-kB–DNA interactions and the related IL- 8 gene expression, were identified by structured based virtual screening (VS) procedures. The most active compound selected through VS analysis showed furocoumarin structure, thus a focus library of differently substituted psoralens has been projected and synthesized to determine their activity on NF-kB/DNA interactions and TNF-alpha induced expression of IL- 8. The title compounds present linear furocoumarin scaffold with methyl or tert-butyl substituent in the furan ring, an acetic or propionic residue in the 6 position and an aminoacid residue linked to the carboxylic function through amidic bond. The synthetic route was performed taking advantage of microwave assisted organic protocols, obtaining higher yield and reduced reaction times, if compared to previously reported methods. [3] EMSA evaluation of NF-kB/DNA interactions will be carried out to determine the biological activity of the synthesized compound.

40|$|To {{identify}} cell {{types and}} genes that are differentially expressed during immunopathogenesis of avian reovirus (ARV) -induced <b>viral</b> <b>arthritis</b> (VA), we inoculated arthrotropic strain SI 133 of ARV into 1 -day-old broilers, and examined tissue histology {{as well as}} RNA expression at different days post-inoculation (PI). Using immunohistochemical staining, we detected many CD 68 expressing macrophages {{in and around the}} blood vessels of the arthritic joints. By RT-PCR, we found that expression of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) and bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2) was induced earlier in footpads and hock joints of ARV-infected chickens. By employing suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) technique and RT-PCR, we further identified that small subunit of U 2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U 2 AF(35) or U 2 AF 1) mRNA was differentially induced in the joint of ARV-infected chickens. By in situ hybridization (ISH), mRNA signals of U 2 AF(35) and BMP- 2 were located in chondrocytes within/near the epiphyseal plate and secondary center of ossification, and in epidermal cells and dermal fibroblast-like cells of arthritic joints. In addition, U 2 AF(35) mRNA was expressed in the inflammatory infiltrates of the bone marrow of ARV-infected arthritic joints, while MMP- 2 was mainly detected in chondrocytes. Interestingly, among U 2 AF(35), MMP- 2, and BMP- 2 that were differentially expressed in the joint of ARV-infected chickens, only U 2 AF(35) induction correlated well with arthritic manifestation. Because U 2 AF(35) may assist in mRNA splicing of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines, our results indicated that U 2 AF(35) induction might play an immunopathological role in ARV-induced arthritis.

40|$|The lack of {{expression}} of the Suppressor of Cytokine Signalling- 3 (SOCS 3) or inactivation of the negative regulatory capacity of SOCS 3 {{has been well documented}} in rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> <b>viral</b> hepatitis and cancer. The specific qualitative and quantitative consequences of SOCS 3 -deficiency on IL- 6 -mediated pro- and anti-inflammatory responses remain controversial in vitro and unknown in vivo. Mice with a conditional deletion of SOCS 3 in hematopoietic cells develop lethal inflammatory disease during adult life and develop gross histopathological changes during experimental arthritis, typified by elevated IL- 6 levels. To clarify the nature of the IL- 6 responses in vivo, we generated mice deficient in SOCS 3 (SOCS 3 −/Δvav) or both SOCS 3 and IL- 6 (IL- 6 −/−/ SOCS 3 −/Δ vav) and examined responses in models of acute and chronic inflammation. Acute responses to IL- 1 β were lethal to SOCS 3 −/Δ vav mice but not IL- 6 −/−/SOCS 3 −/Δ vav mice, indicating that IL- 6 was required for the lethal inflammation induced by IL- 1 β. Administration of IL- 1 β to SOCS 3 −/Δ vav mice induced systemic apoptosis of lymphocytes in the thymus, spleen and lymph nodes that was dependent on the presence of IL- 6.

40|$|Glycans are {{a diverse}} group of compounds, which include glycoproteins and glycolipids and are ubiquitously present on cell surfaces. As a result glycan {{interactions}} are responsible for a number of medical conditions such as autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> <b>viral</b> infections and as a cause of inflammation. Fully understanding the structure and function of these compounds requires the use of innovative surface analytical methods for screening large numbers of different glycans against serums, for biomarkers attributed to these illnesses. The main objective of this work was to produce and characterise glycan surfaces with reliable, reproducible and quantitative readouts. However, the complex nature of glycans means that analysis of their interactions on microarray surfaces doesn’t always produce reliable readouts. The surfaces analysed also include commercially available amine coated slides for quality assurance and maleimide slides, which were produced by treating amine coated slides with 6 -maleimidohexanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (‘EMCS’ as denoted by Sigma Aldrich). Thiolated sugars can then react and covalently bond with the maleimide surfaces. Heterogeneous glycan immobilisation within spots is characterised using surface chemical analysis and compared to literature observation. The progress of the project titled “Measurement and Characterisation of Glycans on Surfaces” to date involved producing microarrays of β-D-thioglucose on a maleimide functionalised surface in order to see how phosphate buffered saline affected the surface chemistry and characterisation of the spots on the surface by using time of flight – secondary ion mass spectrometry...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, we {{have studied}} the {{immunological}} processes of joint inflammation that may be targets for future treatment of patients with arthritis. We focus on the immune-modulating properties of interferon-α (IFN-α) and uridine in experimental arthritis. The nucleoside uridine, which is regarded a safe treatment has anti-inflammatory properties notably by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor (TNF) release. Because the inflamed synovium in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterised by pathogenic TNF-production, uridine could potentially be away to ameliorate arthritis. Systemic administration of uridine {{had no effect on}} antigeninduced arthritis (AIA), which is a T-cell dependent model where animals are immunized twice (sensitization) with bovine serum albumin (mBSA), before local triggering of arthritis by intra-articular antigen (mBSA) re-challenge. In contrast, intra-articular administration of uridine clearly down modulated development of AIA in a dose dependent manner and inhibited the expression of synovial adhesion molecules, influx of inflammatory leukocytes and synovial expression of TNF and interleukin 6, but did not affect systemic levels of proinflammatory cytokines or antigen-specific T-cell responses. Local administration of uridine may thus be a viable therapeutic option for treatment of arthritis in the future. Viral double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsRNA), a common nucleic acid found in most viruses, {{can be found in the}} joints of RA patients and local deposition of such <b>viral</b> dsRNA induces <b>arthritis</b> by activating IFN-α. Here we show that arthritis induced by dsRNA can be mediated by IFN-producing dendritic cells in the joint and this may thus explain why viral infections are sometimes associated with arthritis. Earlier, to study the effect of dsRNA and IFN-α in an arthritis model, that like RA, is dependent on adaptive immunity, dsRNA and IFN-α were administered individually during the development of AIA. Both molecules clearly protected against AIA in a type I IFN receptor-dependent manner but were only effective if administered in the sensitization phase of AIA. Here we show that the anti-inflammatory effect of IFN-α is critically dependent on signalling via transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and the enzymatic activity of indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO). The IDO enzyme is produced by plasmacytoid DC and this cell type was critically required both during antigen sensitization and in the arthritis phase of AIA for the protective effect of IFN-α against AIA. In contrast, TGF-β and the enzymatic activity of IDO were only required during sensitization, which indicate that they are involved in initial steps of tolerogenic antigen sensitization. In this scenario, IFN- α first activates the enzymatic activity of IDO in pDC, which converts Tryptophan to Kynurenine, which thereafter activates TGF-β. Common for IDO-expressing pDC, Kyn and TGF-β is their ability to induce development of regulatory T cells (Tregs). We found that Tregs were crucial for IFN-α-mediated protection against AIA, but only in the arthritis phase. In line with this, adoptive transfer of Tregs isolated from IFN-α treated mice to recipient animals in the arthritis phase clearly protected against AIA. The numbers of Tregs were not significantly altered by IFN-α but IFN-α increased the suppressive capacity of Tregs against antigen-induced proliferation. This enhanced suppressive activity of Tregs in the arthritis phase was dependent on the earlier activated enzyme IDO 1 during the sensitization phase of AIA. Thus, presence of IFN-α at the time of antigen sensitization activates the enzymatic activity of IDO, which generates Tregs with enhanced suppressive capacity that upon antigen re-challenge prevents inflammation. We have thus identified one example of how immune tolerance can be developed, that may be a future way to combat autoimmunity...|$|R

40|$|Background: Avian {{reovirus}} (ARV) is {{a member}} of the Orthoreovirus genus in the Reoviridae family. It is the etiological agent of several diseases, among which <b>viral</b> <b>arthritis</b> and malabsorption syndrome are the most commercially important, causing considerable economic losses in the poultry industry. Although a small but increasing number of reports have characterized some aspects of ARV infection, global changes in protein expression in ARV-infected host cells have not been examined. The current study used a proteomics approach to obtain a comprehensive view of changes in protein levels in host cells upon infection by ARV. Methodology and Principal Findings: The proteomics profiles of DF- 1 chicken fibroblast cells infected with ARV strain S 1133 were analyzed by two-dimensional differential-image gel electrophoresis. The majority of protein expression changes ($ 1. 5 fold, p, 0. 05) occurred at 72 h post-infection. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry identified 51 proteins with differential expression levels, including 25 that were upregulated during ARV infection and 26 that were downregulated. These proteins were divided into eight groups according to biological function: signal transduction, stress response, RNA processing, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, and cytoskeleton organization. They were further examined by immunoblotting to validate the observed alterations in protein expression...|$|E

In this study, the nucleotide sequences of the P 10 - and P 17 -encoding genes from 17 field isolates and vaccine strains of ARV isolated over a 23 -year period from distinct geographic locations were analyzed to define phylogenetic profiles and to study sequence variability and genetic evolution. These genes displayed {{the signs of}} {{a high level of}} sequence divergence and have evolved into five distinct lineages, respectively. The P 17 -encoding gene showed higher sequence divergence than that of P 10 -encoding gene. Our results indicated that synonymous substitutions predominate over nonsynonymous substitutions in both genes. Comparison of P 10 and P 17 gene phylograms with those of S-class genes revealed distinct evolutionary patterns, indicating that P 10 and P 17 evolve in an independent manner. Comparative sequence analysis also showed extensive sequence divergence between ARV and other orthoreoviruses.

ARVs are associated with <b>viral</b> <b>arthritis,</b> immunosuppression, and enteric diseases in poultry. The sigma C protein was involved in induction of apoptosis and neutralization antibody. In the present study, sigma C-His protein was expressed in Sf 9 insect cells and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Eight monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against sigma C-His and three mAbs against His were screened from hybridoma cells produced by fusion of splenocytes from immunized mice with NS 1 myeloma cells. Among the eight mAbs against sigma C protein, all belonged to the IgG isotype except three for IgM. It was discovered that all anti-His mAbs were mixtures of IgG and IgM isotypes. mAbs reacted with sigma C-His protein in a conformation-independent manner based on dot blot and western blotting assays. The competitive binding assay indicated that all mAbs recognized the same epitope on sigma C protein that was conserved in different isolates. Compared with the commercial anti-ARV S 1133 polyclonal antibody, mAb (D 15) had universal reactivity to all serotypes or genotypes of ARVs tested.

Microscopically, the main lesion was a multifocal vacuolar degeneration and necrosis of randomly distributed small groups of hepatocytes with presence of apoptotic and multinucleated syncytial cells. Necrotic foci were also found in the lungs as well as a hemorrhagic, granulomatous, and heterophilic cellulitis and myositis of the neck and a generalized depletion and lymphocytolysis of lymphoid organs. At 8 days of age, birds also began to show hock swelling histologically characterized by a fibrinoleucocytic inflammation of the articulation and tendon sheaths, with hyperplasia of the synovial membrane, and lymphoplasmocytic infiltration. PCR and viral culture of livers were positive for ARV. Partial sequencing of the S 1 gene from the virus isolate showed 99. 2 % to 99. 8 % homology with three vaccinal strains (ARV S 1133, 1733, and 2408).

Investigation at the hatchery revealed that chicks were inadvertently administered an S 1133 reovirus vaccine labeled for water administration in 10 - to 17 -week-old chickens.

Methods: The full length of the known variable protein σC and part of the σB encoding genes, were amplified with RT-PCR, using conserved primers. PCR products were sequenced and the sequences were analyzed and aligned with avian reovirus sequences from the Genbank database. Results: The sequences of σC-encoding genes of all the isolated strains indicated their close relationship with the American, Chinese and Indian strains. Taking the American strain S 1133 as a reference, the two Tunisian isolates 97. 1 and 97. 2 showed some nucleotide substitutions. For isolate 97. 1, the substitution was silent whereas for strain 97. 2 the mutation was at the first position of the corresponding codon and induced the substitution of the amino acid encoded. For the σB-encoding gene, the sequences of the Tunisian strains showed mutations at positions two or three of the corresponding codons, inducing substitutions of amino acids at these positions. The phylogenic trees based on σC and σB encoding genes indicated closer relationship between Tunisian, American and Taiwanese isolates of genotype I. Conclusion: Our study describes the genotype of avian reoviruses that are not yet well characterized genetically. The characterization and classification of these viruses might be significant for understanding the epidemiology of malabsorption syndrome and <b>viral</b> <b>arthritis,</b> and improving our knowledge of the genotype of strains circulating in Tunisian flocks. Furthermore, the study of their variable pathogenicity could be extremely important in the choice of the appropriate vaccine strain to control disease...|$|E

40|$|Ross River virus (RRV) is an Alphavirus {{distributed}} throughout Australia. It is transmitted by mosquitoes {{and is known}} to cause moderate to severe disease symptoms in humans. Along with other alphaviruses such as Sindbis virus and Chikungunya virus, RRV is known to cause arthritic symptoms, characterised by muscle and joint inflammation. Several investigations have established the role of macrophage cells and pro-inflammatory host factors {{in the development of}} RRV-induced disease. In this study, we attempted to determine differences between RRV passaged in mammalian and mosquito cells. There is strong evidence that arthropod-borne viruses are able to display enhanced infectivity when passaged into arthropod cell line. We showed that mosquito cell-derived RRV (mos-RRV) was able to replicate to higher titres than mammalian cell-derived RRV. We also showed that mos-RRV failed to induce Type I IFN-associated antiviral responses. The second aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the role of TNF-a, a pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in arthritic diseases, in the development of RRV disease. We treated RRV-infected C 57 BL/ 6 J mice with a commercially available TNF-a inhibitor drug and monitored disease signs. We found that the TNF-a inhibitor does not ameliorate RRV disease (RRVD) symptoms, and that it does not prevent muscle and joint inflammation. We analysed histological sections of muscle and joint tissue of Enbrel-treated and untreated, RRV-infected cells. We also determined and compared host cytokine expression profiles. Finally, we sought to determine the requirement for natural killer (NK) cells in RRV disease. NK cells have been detected in the synovium of RRV-infected patients since early studies, but their role in disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Using a NK-dysfunctional mouse (C 57 BL/ 6 J-Lystbg), we showed that mice lacking a functional NK system are more susceptible to RRV disease than wildtype, C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. We monitored disease symptoms following RRV infection and assessed muscle and joint inflammation in Lystbg and C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. This thesis examines mechanisms of viral infection and immune evasion employed by RRV, as well as into the role of host cells and cytokines in RRVD pathogenesis disease mechanisms. We showed that a functional NK cell system is required for the regulation of RRV-induced muscle and joint inflammation. Our characterisation of the use of a commercial TNF-a inhibitor in RRV-induced disease in mice may provide information on the role of TNF-a in <b>viral</b> <b>arthritis,</b> and may help towards developing safe and effective treatment...|$|E
