25|$|Westinghouse Electric Corporation built Televox in 1926; {{it was a}} {{cardboard}} cutout connected to various devices which users could turn on and off. In 1939, the humanoid robot known as Elektro was debuted at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Seven feet tall (2.1 m) and weighing 265 pounds (120.2kg), it could walk by <b>voice</b> <b>command,</b> speak about 700 words (using a 78-rpm record player), smoke cigarettes, blow up balloons, and move its head and arms. The body consisted of a steel gear, cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin. In 1928, Japan's first robot, Gakutensoku, was designed and constructed by biologist Makoto Nishimura.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{had split}} {{opinions}} on Anniversarys additional features. The stereoscopic 3D effect was alternately praised and dismissed: Matt Miller of Game Informer {{wrote that the}} feature [...] "doesn't add anything to the experience", while Aziz described the feature as [...] "fantastic", considering its use in Anniversary to be more subtle and pleasing than in other games. Aziz also applauded the narrative terminals, although he criticized the Kinect <b>voice</b> <b>command</b> support for being slower in combat than pressing buttons. Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica enjoyed the improvements of the Halo maps in Anniversarys multiplayer mode, but criticized the inability to play said mode via four-person local split screen as in the original game. Reynolds agreed with 343 Industries's choice to use Reach for Anniversarys multiplayer mode, writing that the map pack offered [...] "a smart way of reintroducing players back into the game", as well as commending Halos combat for offering an alternative to contemporary military shooters.|$|E

40|$|Voice assistants like Siri {{enable us}} to control IoT devices {{conveniently}} with <b>voice</b> <b>commands,</b> however, they also provide new attack opportunities for adversaries. Previous papers attack voice assistants with obfuscated <b>voice</b> <b>commands</b> by leveraging the gap between speech recognition system and human voice perception. The limitation is that these obfuscated commands are audible and thus conspicuous to device owners. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to directly attack the microphone used for sensing voice data with inaudible <b>voice</b> <b>commands.</b> We show that the adversary can exploit the microphone's non-linearity and play well-designed inaudible ultrasounds to cause the microphone to record normal <b>voice</b> <b>commands,</b> and thus control the victim device inconspicuously. We demonstrate via end-to-end real-world experiments that our inaudible <b>voice</b> <b>commands</b> can attack an Android phone and an Amazon Echo device with high success rates at a range of 2 - 3 meters...|$|R

500|$|Xbox One's user {{interface}} uses Microsoft's Fluent Design System; previous iterations of the console's software used the Metro design language. The dashboard {{is divided into}} [...] "Home", [...] "Mixer", [...] "Community", [...] "Entertainment", and [...] "Store" [...] sections, with the [...] "Home" [...] page further divided into [...] "blocks" [...] that can display pinned games/apps, {{as well as other}} content. Pressing the Xbox Guide button opens a sidebar with access to common functions such as the friends list, apps, the user's party, and settings. [...] Users can go back to the dashboard while using games or apps using either the Xbox button on their controller or a voice command; up to four apps can run (either actively or in the background) at once, but only one game can run at a time. Use of Kinect enables the ability to control the console via voice commands. Xbox One's voice control capabilities are similar to, albeit richer than those of Xbox 360. The voice assistant Cortana was added in 2016 to provide expanded <b>voice</b> <b>command</b> functionality with natural language recognition.|$|E

The car has {{horizontal}} fins flanking a pair of jet engines, large wheels with low profile tires, as well as sharply angled canopy. This version, as is common with Batmobiles, seems very durable, with low profile armoring, as throughout the show it has taken shots from rocket launchers without any noticeable damage, stood up to high powered demolition machinery without any visible markings {{to the point of}} breaking said machinery, etc. The interior features a <b>voice</b> <b>command</b> system, a video link system, and more, directly routed to the Batcomputer.|$|E
40|$|Paper {{deals with}} the speech {{recognition}} software for controlling computer programs and electric devices by voice. Internet Explorer or any other computer program, which supports special keyboard combinations could be controlled by <b>voice</b> <b>commands.</b> The essential features of the control program are: the possibility to work with any installed in the system speech recognition engine, the possibility to make and to change <b>voice</b> <b>commands</b> and to change reactions to <b>voice</b> <b>commands,</b> the possibility to input the text by spelling. Electric devices could be turned on or turned off by voice with additional USB-based hardware. Speaker dependent projection based recognition algorithm, which was used in Lithuanian speech recognition engine, is described. The accuracy of recognition of ten Lithuanian commands by Lithuanian and English speech recognition engines was checked.

2500|$|The Batmobile's shields {{are made}} of ceramic fractal armor panels. They explode outward when struck by projectiles, {{deflecting}} injurious force {{away from the car}} and its occupants. If Batman must leave the Batmobile {{for an extended period of}} time, he can, through a <b>voice</b> <b>command</b> spoken into a wrist device (specifically, the word [...] "shields"), activate the Batmobile's shielding system. This prevents anyone from tampering with the vehicle while it is left unattended. Bulletproof and fireproof steel armor plates envelop the body and cockpit entirely. While this armor is in place, the vehicle cannot be driven. In Batman the shields were not fully functioning. In reality, a life-size model was built, and the shield activation sequence was created with stop motion animation technology. In Batman Returns, the shields held the same characteristics. However, the design was slimmer and the special effects were provided by computer-generated imagery. In shield mode, a small but powerful bomb can be deployed.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{they rushed}} at him, {{five or six}} of them, and, {{although}} he wounded another man, dragged him from his horse, and, as he lay upon his back, sprang at him to finish him before he could rise. Already their knives and swords were over him, and he was making his farewells to life, {{when he heard a}} <b>voice</b> <b>command</b> them to desist and bind his arms. This was quickly done, and he was suffered to rise from the ground to see before him, not Morella, as he half expected, but a man clad in fine armour beneath his rough cloak, evidently an officer of rank. [...] "What kind of a Moor are you," [...] he asked, [...] "who dare to kill the soldiers of the Holy Hermandad {{in the heart of the}} King's country?" [...] and he pointed to the dead man.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the gifts}} of Zinti lay rather in {{tracking}} and remembering paths and directions than in fighting men, {{so that when he}} heard this order he was afraid and hesitated. But when she saw it, Sihamba turned upon him so fiercely that he feared her more than the watchman, and went at once, so that this man who was half asleep suddenly saw the muzzle of a roer within three paces of his head and heard a <b>voice</b> <b>command</b> him to stand still and silent or die. Thus he stood indeed until he perceived that the new wife of his chief was escaping. Then remembering what would be his fate at the hands of Bull-Head he determined to take his chance of being shot, and, turning suddenly, sped towards the kraal shouting as he ran, whereon Zinti fired at him, but the ball went wide. A cannon could scarcely have made more noise than did the great roer in the silence of the night as the report of it echoed to and fro among the hills.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper proposes an {{interaction}} with mechatronic {{system based on}} <b>voice</b> <b>commands.</b> The goal {{of this research is}} to develop a human-machine interface that could be able to control a mechatronic system by using <b>voice</b> <b>commands.</b> With the use of low features extracted from the <b>voice</b> <b>commands,</b> the system will be trained to recognize specific commands. After the training, the commands are recognized and transferred to the controlled system. Intelligent techniques are used with a combination of Hidden Markov Models and Dynamic Time Wrapping for the training and the recognition. The LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT robotics platform controlled by custom software developed under max/msp program is the evaluation tool of the system. The system is tested with different set of commands and the experimental results show that the interaction is efficient with a number of 92 % of accuracy on <b>voice</b> <b>commands.</b> Index Term [...] Human machine Interaction, Voice control...|$|R
