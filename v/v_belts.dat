30|$|In this paper, {{we first}} discuss the {{development}} of the field of tribology, and highlight some of the main problems encountered in this area, such as lack of systematicness, loose correlation, and inadequate focus on the microscopic perspective. Then, we provide basic formulas of frictional mechanics while considering the friction effect on classical mechanics formulae. In order to carry out the frictional mechanics analysis, we first classify the interface. According to the size analysis of surface films, the manufacturing roughness of the surface, the contact width, and the roller radius of the rolling contact bearing, frictional mechanics has the features of interface mechanics, while interfaces are classified based on {{the presence or absence of}} a medium. Based on the classification, we further analyze the pressure and frictional stress of sliding and rolling friction problems without a medium, such as a slider, wedge key, and <b>V</b> <b>belt.</b> We also analyze problems with a medium, such as journal and rolling contact bearings. By comparing these results with those of classical mechanics without considering friction, we see that (1) friction causes deviations in the result for classical mechanics which does not consider friction, and (2) if the frictional stress and normal pressure affect each other, their interaction should be considered simultaneously. Finally, we summarize the friction problems, namely, sliding and rolling, with and without a medium, and deformed and non-deformed. From our analysis, we propose two conclusions. First, the frictional mechanics problem is a deviation of the classical mechanics problem, and secondly, frictional stress and normal pressure influence each other.|$|R

5000|$|The 431-cubic-inch {{displacement}} 1938-40 Cadillac V16 {{was one of}} {{the last}} new American auto engine designs prior to World War Two. As such, it incorporated some of the latest thinking. Nine main bearings provided a crankshaft main bearing support between each 135 degree opposing pair of cylinders. The square bore and stroke lowered piston speed and promoted crankshaft rigidity, no small matter for an engine with eight cylinders in line per cylinder bank. The side valve engine design was no handicap for the time because the era's typical top engine speed of 3400-3700 rpm provided little opportunity to exploit the high speed breathing efficiency of overhead valves. Luxury car drivers presumably valued smoothness and silence more than high speed power. Hydraulic valve lifters promoted silent running and an absence of periodic adjustment. Unlike most cars of the era, an external oil filter safeguarded the precision valve lifters. Despite the use of side valves, the engine produced as much power as the prior 45 degree V16, and with much less complexity. The earliest engines produced featured an innovative friction wheel drive to the generator. This was soon replaced by a conventional <b>V</b> <b>belt</b> drive. Cadillac claimed that the 1938, 1939, and 1940 Series 90 Sixteen had the best performance of any production car in the world at the time and would accelerate 10-60 in high gear only in 16 seconds.
