5|$|Any {{one-dimensional}} reversible {{cellular automaton}} may be placed into rectangular form, after which its transition rule may be factored into {{the action of}} an idempotent semicentral bigroupoid (a reversible rule for which regions of cells with a single state <b>value</b> <b>change</b> only at their boundaries) together with a permutation {{on the set of}} states. The first-order invariants for the idempotent lifting of the automaton rule (the modified rule formed by omitting the permutation) necessarily behave like the ones for a rectangular band: they have a basis of invariants that flow either leftwards or rightwards at a constant rate without interaction. The first-order invariants for the overall automaton are then exactly the invariants for the idempotent lifting that give equal weight to every pair of states that belong to the same orbit of the permutation. However, the permutation of states in the rule may cause these invariants to behave differently from in the idempotent lifting, flowing non-uniformly and with interactions.|$|E

2500|$|The American scholar Susan Morgan called Mansfield Park {{the most}} {{difficult}} of all Austen’s novels as it features the weakest of all of Austen’s heroines who ends up the most beloved member of the Bertram family. Morgan argued that to understand the novel properly requires understanding of the capacity for characters to change or not to change. Mary Crawford, while possessing some good qualities and having much charm and vivacity is ultimately doomed by her superficiality, materialism and an inability to change. A telling example of Mary’s character occurs when says [...] "Look, where I will, I see that it is so; and I feel that it must be", as she assumes that what she sees before her is all that will ever be, and the possibility of anything else existing does not occur to her. Through not devoid of kindness, Mary has a strong competitive streak that leads her to see love as a game where one party conquers and controls the other, which coupled with her cynicism and narcissism makes her insensitive towards the feelings of others, as she insists that Edmund abandons his clerical career merely it is not prestigious enough for her and her inability to appreciate improvements, as she likes things whole and lacks the discernment to <b>value</b> <b>change</b> in one's moral character and the hard work necessary to bring it about. Price by contrast is unique amongst the Austen heroines in that her story begins when she is 10 and traces her story up to the age 17. When Price is sent to Mansfield Park, her tears at leaving the only home she has ever known, shows her awareness of the past, of who she is and was, and her wish to maintain her identity. Morgan wrote though Price is a flawed heroine, she possesses [...] "…the energy, open to us all, to struggle against selfishness, toward self-knowledge, and that generosity of mind which should illuminate our view of the people around us.". Austen also suggests change can be either for the worse or the better as Price almost succumbs to Henry Crawford’s charm and apparent reformation of character, even though she knows deep down that he is by nature malleable and undependable because he does not feel very much, and therefore whatever his passions are now will be easily replaced. Morgan argued that Price’s principle virtue is that of" [...] growing worth", her ability to understand the world around her, to use her reason, to care about others, to change yet remain true to herself.|$|E

30|$|In each interim or annual {{financial}} statement, FAS 159 requires {{firms to}} disclose their reasons for electing the fair value option for each item. Firms also need to disclose which balance sheet items contain liabilities for which the FVOL has been elected. FAS 159 further requires firms to disclose gains and losses from fair <b>value</b> <b>changes</b> for each income statement line item included in earnings. Generally, gains and losses from <b>changes</b> in fair <b>values</b> for which the FVOL has been elected {{do not need to}} be disclosed separately from other fair <b>value</b> <b>changes</b> in the same line item. As an exception, firms need to separately disclose gains and losses from fair <b>value</b> <b>changes</b> that are attributable to changes in firms’ own credit risk. For example, if a firm’s ability to meet its outstanding debt decreases, the market value of its issued debt decreases simultaneously. On the other hand, if markets assume that a firm’s solvency improved, its liabilities’ market values increase. Such <b>value</b> <b>changes</b> are called DVAs—debt valuation adjustments due to a change in own credit risk.|$|R
