25|$|In {{most cases}} {{involving}} institutional investors, the daily <b>variation</b> <b>margin</b> settlement guidelines for futures call for actual money movement only above some insignificant amount to avoid wiring {{back and forth}} small sums of cash.

30|$|Moreover, {{the bank}} can use reserve capital as <b>variation</b> <b>margin.</b> Note that the {{marginal}} {{cost of capital}} for using capital as a funding source for <b>variation</b> <b>margin</b> is nil, because when one posts cash against <b>variation</b> <b>margin,</b> the valuation of the collateralized hedge is reset to zero and the total capital amount does not change. If, instead, the bank were to post capital as initial margin, then the bank would record a “margin receivable” entry on its balance sheet, which however cannot contribute to capital since this asset is too illiquid and impossible to unwind without unwinding all underlying derivatives. Hence, capital can only be used as VM, while it seems that IM must be borrowed entirely.|$|R

30|$|In {{the present}} paper we apply this {{framework}} to the concrete setup of a bank engaged in bilateral trade portfolios. In this context, the discounted expectation of losses due to the default of counterparties or of the bank itself are respectively known as CVA (credit valuation adjustment) and DVA (debt valuation adjustment). Counterparty risk mitigants include the <b>variation</b> <b>margin</b> (VM), tracking the mark-to-market of client portfolios, and the initial margin (IM) set as a cushion against gap risk, which is the risk of slippage between the portfolio and its <b>variation</b> <b>margin</b> during liquidation periods. The cost of funding cash collateral for the <b>variation</b> <b>margin</b> is known as funding valuation adjustment (FVA), while the cost of funding segregated collateral posted as initial margin is the margin valuation adjustment (MVA). Contra-liability counterparts of the FVA and the MVA arise as the FDA (funding debt adjustment) and the MDA (margin debt adjustment). The contra-liability component of a unilateral CVA is dubbed CVACL.|$|R
50|$|The main {{credit support}} {{documents}} governed by English law are the 1995 Credit Support Annex, the 1995 Credit Support Deed and the 2016 Credit Support Annex for <b>Variation</b> <b>Margin.</b> The English law Credit Support Annexes provide for title transfer collateral, whereas the English law Credit Support Deed {{provides for a}} security interest to be granted over transferred collateral. The 2016 Credit Support Annex for <b>Variation</b> <b>Margin</b> has been specifically introduced to allow parties to comply with their obligations to exchange <b>Variation</b> <b>Margin</b> in accordance with margin regimes around the world, including EMIR in Europe and Dodd-Frank in the United States of America. The English law Credit Support Annexes are Confirmations, and the transactions constituted by them are Transactions, under the Master Agreement and therefore form part of the single agreement together with the Master Agreement. The English law Credit Support Deed, on the other hand, is a separate agreement between the parties.|$|R

40|$|This paper studies how the {{allocation}} of residual losses affects trading and welfare in a central counterparty. I compare loss sharing under two loss-allocation mechanisms - <b>variation</b> <b>margin</b> haircutting and cash calls - and study the privately and socially optimal degree of loss sharing. For losses allocated using <b>variation</b> <b>margin</b> haircuts, I find that trading volume is sensitive {{to the degree of}} loss sharing and to the risk sensitivity of skinin-the-game capital. By contrast, for cash calls, the degree of loss sharing does not affect trading volume but instead affects the chance that a cash call is honoured, which can constrain the recovery of funds. A welfare analysis characterizes the market outcome and compares it with the social optimum...|$|R

3000|$|We {{apply to}} the {{concrete}} setup of a bank engaged into bilateral trade portfolios the XVA theoretical framework of [...] (Albanese and Crépey 2017), whereby so-called contra-liabilities and cost of capital are charged by the bank to its clients, {{on top of the}} fair valuation of counterparty risk, in order to account for the incompleteness of this risk. The transfer of the residual reserve credit capital from shareholders to creditors at bank default results in a unilateral CVA, consistent with the regulatory requirement that capital should not diminish as an effect of the sole deterioration of the bank credit spread. Our funding cost for <b>variation</b> <b>margin</b> (FVA) is defined asymmetrically since there is no benefit in holding excess capital in the future. Capital is fungible as a source of funding for <b>variation</b> <b>margin,</b> causing a material FVA reduction. We introduce a specialist initial margin lending scheme that drastically reduces the funding cost for initial margin (MVA). Our capital valuation adjustment (KVA) is defined as a risk premium, i.e. the cost of remunerating shareholder capital at risk at some hurdle rate.|$|R
