40|$|The aim of my {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to present the process of enlargement of the European Union {{with a view to}} the pre-accession instruments used to help the <b>associated</b> <b>country</b> to enter the union, as well as to present these <b>associated</b> <b>countries</b> so called candidate and potential candidate countries. My thesis is divided into six chapters. The first one describes briefly the history of expansion of the European Communities and the European Union. The second one is about the enlargement process in general. The two following chapters depict the pre-accession instruments { [...] } political, juridical and financial used to support the efforts of the <b>associated</b> <b>countries.</b> Finally the last two chapters present in detail the candidate and the potential candidate countries...|$|R

40|$|A {{necessary}} {{prerequisite for}} achieving the benefits consists in consistent {{implementation of the}} EC regulations in the <b>associated</b> <b>countries</b> and the climate of mutual confidence between both parties. An incomplete harmonisation in the <b>associated</b> <b>countries</b> {{at the time of}} joining the ECs would lead to market deformations with negative consequences for both the business sphere and the consumers within the whole integration formation. The <b>associated</b> <b>countries</b> must be ready not only as regards their legislation, but also in terms of their economic performance. Joining the internal market prematurely, without preparing themselves for the strict competition, would have a very negative impact on industries not ready for the competition. It should be in the interest of each <b>associated</b> <b>country</b> to prepare itself, within the pre-accession strategy for the single internal market to such extent that it will be able of fully participating from the very moment of the accession. Too long transition periods, or protectionist measures taken for the purpose of solving problems arisen after the joining the ECs, would restrict the benefits to be achieved by a smoothly working internal market.
