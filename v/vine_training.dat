25|$|For most of history, {{regional}} tradition largely dictated {{what type}} of <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> would {{be found in a}} given area. In the early 20th century, many of these traditions were codified into specific wine laws and regulations such as the French Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) system. The widespread study and utilization of various training systems began in the 1960s when many New World wine regions were developing their wine industry. Without the centuries of tradition that influenced Old world winemaking and viticulture, vine growers in areas like California, Washington, Australia and New Zealand conducted large scale research into how particular <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> systems, pruning and canopy management techniques impacted wine quality. As research in this area continued into the 21st century, new <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> systems were developed that could be adapted to the desired wine making style the grapes were destined for as well as the labor needs and particular mesoclimate of the vineyard.|$|E
25|$|In {{deciding}} on {{what type of}} <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> system to use, growers will also consider the climate conditions of the vineyard where the amount of sunlight, humidity and wind could have a large impact on the exact benefits the training system offers. For instance, while having a large spread out canopy (such as what the Geneva Double Curtain offers) can promote a favorable leaf to fruit ratio for photosynthesis, it offers very little wind protection. In places such as the Châteauneuf-du-Pape, strong prevailing winds such as le mistral can take the fruit right off the vine so a more condensed, protective <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> system is desirable for vineyards there.|$|E
25|$|The grape {{clusters}} of Mourvèdre are relatively compact, enhancing its susceptibility to mildew, with small thick-skinned berries that {{are high in}} both color and flavor phenolics, particularly tannins. Even though the variety ripens late, {{it has the potential}} to ripen to high Brix sugar levels which can translate into a high alcohol level during fermentation. The vine can also be very vigorous, producing abundant foliage that can shade the grape clusters, affecting canopy management decisions for growers. In Australia and California, many of the oldest plantings of Mourvèdre are bush trained as the vines grows well vertically but the variety can be grown under many different kinds of <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> systems.|$|E

25|$|The 4th-century BC Greek writer Theophrastus left a {{detailed}} record of some Greek influences and innovations in viticulture, {{one of which}} was the study of vineyard soils and their proper match to specific grapevines. Another innovation was the minimization of yields for more intense concentration of flavors and quality, rather than increased quantity. The economics of the time favored high yields for most crops, and intentionally limiting agricultural output was exceedingly uncommon in the ancient world. Theophrastus also detailed the practice of using suckering and plant cuttings for new vineyard plantings. The Greeks also employed <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> with stacked plants for easier cultivation and harvesting, rather than let the grapevines grow untrained in bushes or up trees.|$|E
25|$|Various {{methods of}} <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> were {{introduced}} in Argentina by European immigrants in the 19th and 20th century. The espaldera system combined the traditional method of using three wires to train the vines close to the ground. In the 1950s a new system known as parral cuyano was introduced where vines were trained high off {{the ground with the}} clusters allowed to hang down. This style was conducive to the high yielding varieties of Criolla and Cereza that were the backbone of the bulk wine production industry that arose in response to the large domestic market. In the late 20th century, as the market turned to focus more on premium wine production, more producers switched back to the traditional espaldera system and began to practice canopy management in order to control yields.|$|E
25|$|Grüner Veltliner {{has been}} {{believed}} to {{date back to}} Roman times, with its name being derived from Veltlin (Valtellina) in northern Italy, though ampelographers and wine historians {{have yet to find}} a link between the grape and the Italian commune. The grape is likely indigenous to Austria. The current name appeared in a document {{for the first time in}} 1855; before that time it was known as Weißgipfler. Only by the 1930s was Grüner Veltliner established as the standard name of the grape. Until the Second World War it was regarded as just another Austrian grape. It took Lenz Moser's Hochkultur system of <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> to really get the best out of it, and it expanded quickly in plantation from the 1950s to later become Austria's most planted variety.|$|E

25|$|Pliny was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for <b>training</b> <b>vines</b> up trees in a pergola, noting that the finest wines in Campania all derived from this practice. Due to the dangers in working on and pruning <b>vines</b> <b>trained</b> this way, however, he advised not using valuable slaves but rather vineyard workers hired with a stipulation in their contract to cover grave and funeral expenses. He described some contemporary varieties, recommending Aminean and Nomentan as the best. Ampelographers believe that two white wine varieties mentioned, Arcelaca and Argitis, may be early ancestors to the modern grape Riesling.|$|R

25|$|The Beaujolais {{region has}} one of the highest vine density ratios of any major {{worldwide}} wine region, with anywhere from 9000 to 13,000 vines per hectare. Most vines are trained in the traditional gobelet style, where the spurs of the vines are pushed upwards and arranged in a circle, resembling a chalice. This method has its roots in the Roman style of <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> and has only recently begun to fall out of favor for the guyot method which involves taking a single or double spur and training it out horizontally. Harvest usually occurs in late September and is almost universally done by hand rather than with the use of mechanical harvesters. This is because the Beaujolais wine-making style of carbonic maceration utilizes whole bunches of grape clusters that normally get broken and separated by a mechanical harvester.|$|E
25|$|The {{annual growth}} cycle of grapevines {{is the process}} {{that takes place in}} the {{vineyard}} each year, beginning with bud break in the spring and culminating in leaf fall in autumn followed by winter dormancy. From a winemaking perspective, each step in the process plays a vital {{role in the development of}} grapes with ideal characteristics for making wine. Viticulturalists and vineyard managers monitor the effect of climate, vine disease and pests in facilitating or impeding the vines progression from bud break, flowering, fruit set, veraison, harvesting, leaf fall and dormancy-reacting if need be with the use of viticultural practices like canopy management, irrigation, <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> and the use of agrochemicals. The stages of the annual growth cycle usually become observable within the first year of a vine's life. The amount of time spent at each stage of the growth cycle depends on a number of factors-most notably the type of climate (warm or cool) and the characteristics of the grape variety.|$|E
25|$|At harvest time, AOC {{regulations}} stipulate grapes for Grand Cru vineyard must {{be picked}} {{with a potential}} alcohol level of at least 11 percent, at least 10.5 percent for Premiers Crus and 9.5 percent for AOC Chablis vineyards. Yields in Grands Crus must be limited to 3.3 tons per acre (45 hectoliters per hectare) with a 20% allowance for increased yields. There is no official regulation {{on the use of}} mechanical harvesting, but most Grand Cru producers prefer hand picking because human pickers tend to be more delicate with the grapes and can distinguish better between ripe and unripe bunches. Over the rest of the Chablis region, mechanical harvesting was used by around 80% of the vineyards {{at the turn of the}} 21st century. The traditional style of <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> in Chablis is to have the vine trained low to the ground for warmth with four cordons stretching out sideways from the trunk.|$|E

For high <b>vines</b> <b>trained</b> along wires, the maximum authorised density is 3,000 vines/ha. For pruning methods in the Condado de Huelva, the most common one is the one known as [...] "en vaso", and for the Palomino Fino and Listán de Huelva varieties, the system used is the one known as [...] "vara y pulgar".|$|R
50|$|The {{arrival of}} maize in the 16th century left a {{distinctive}} stamp on viticulture in the region. To maximise production of maize, new regulations banished vines {{to the field}} margins, {{where they would be}} draped over trees and hedges, forcing the vignerons to pick them from tall ladders. Today, you can find some examples of <b>vines</b> <b>trained</b> by the old methods, but most of the Vinho Verde Region is now using modern methods, which give larger and better yield.|$|R
25|$|In France, Grenache is {{most widely}} {{associated}} with the wines of the Rhone and southern France. Its history in the Rhone {{can be traced to}} the influence of Burgundian wine merchants in the 17-18th centuries who were seeking a blending variety to add body and alcohol content to their light body wines. Grenache, with its propensity for high alcohol and high yields, fit those desire nicely and was widely planted in the Châteauneuf-du-Pape and Gigondas and Vacqueyras regions. Today Grenache is most widely planted in the Languedoc-Roussillon region where it is widely blended with Carignan, Cinsaut, Syrah and Mourvèdre. The vine also has sizable plantings in the Drôme department. The vine's strong, hard wood and affinity for bush <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> allows it to thrive in the Mistral influenced southern Rhone regions of Châteauneuf-du-Pape and Gigondas. In Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Grenache noir is the most common variety of the 13 permitted varieties, although some producers in recent years have been using a higher proportion of Mourvèdre. Grenache produces a sweet juice that can have almost a jam-like consistency when very ripe. Syrah is typically blended to provide color and spice, while Mourvèdre can add elegance and structure to the wine.|$|E
2500|$|While closely related, {{the terms}} trellising, pruning and <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> {{are often used}} interchangeably even though they refer to {{different}} things. Technically speaking, the trellis refers to the actual stakes, posts, wires or other structures that the grapevine is attached to. Some vines are allowed to grow free standing without any attachment to a trellising structure. Part of the confusion between trellising and <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> systems {{stems from the fact}} that <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> systems will often take on the name of the particular type of trellising involved. [...] Pruning refers to the cutting and shaping of the cordon or [...] "arms" [...] of the grapevine in winter which will determine the number of buds that are allowed to become grape clusters. In some wine regions, such as France, the exact number of buds is outlined by Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regulations. During the summer growing season, pruning can involve removing young plant shoots or excess bunches of grapes with green harvesting. <b>Vine</b> <b>training</b> systems utilize the practice of trellising and pruning in order to dictate and control a grape vine's canopy which will influence not only the potential yield of that year's crop but also the quality of the grapes due to the access of air and sunlight needed for the grapes to ripen fully and for preventing various grape diseases.|$|E
2500|$|The use of <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> {{systems in}} {{viticulture}} is aimed primarily {{to assist in}} canopy management with finding the balance in enough foliage to facilitate photosynthesis without excessive shading that could impede grape ripening or promote grape diseases. Additional benefits of utilizing particular training systems could be to control potential yields and to facilitate mechanization of certain vineyard tasks such as pruning, irrigation, applying pesticide or fertilizing sprays as well as harvesting the grapes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{subject was}} {{commonly}} painted in Europe between the 16th - 18th centuries, {{and there are}} examples which feature a <b>vine</b> <b>trained</b> up an elm from Italy, the Netherlands, France and England (see the Gallery below). This was partly encouraged by the entry of the imagery into Emblem books, beginning with {{the most popular of}} them all, Andrea Alciatos Emblemata, in which it figures under the title Amicitia etiam post mortem durans (Friendship lasting even after death). This interpretation had been influenced by a first-century CE poem by Antipater of Thessalonica in which a withered plane tree (rather than an elm) recounts how the <b>vine</b> <b>trained</b> about it keeps it green. Alciato was followed in this interpretation by Geoffrey Whitney in England, using Alciatos illustration but accompanied by verses of his own. Others who took up this theme include Jean Jacques Boissard in his Emblemes latins (1588) and the Dutch poet Daniel Heinsius in his Emblemata Amato ria (1607). The latter makes the tree a plane, following the Greek epigram, interpreting it as the sign of undying love. The French version of his Latin poem reads ...|$|R

When he had closed the door of the patio and we were seated, he rang a silver bell that stood upon the table, and a girl, young and fair, appeared from the house, dressed in a quaint Spanish dress.|$|R
5000|$|From the {{agroforestry}} {{point of}} view, perhaps the world's most advanced {{country is the}} Indian state of Kerala, which boasts no fewer than {{three and a half}} million forest gardens...As an example of the extraordinary intensivity of cultivation of some forest gardens, one plot of only [...] was found by a study group to have twenty-three young coconut palms, twelve cloves, fifty-six bananas, and forty-nine pineapples, with thirty pepper <b>vines</b> <b>trained</b> up its trees. In addition, the small holder grew fodder for his house-cow.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{reasons for}} <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> involve {{setting up the}} {{vineyard}} and each individual vine canopy for more efficient labor usage or mechanization. Vines that are trained to have their [...] "fruiting zone" [...] of grape clusters at waist to chest height are easier for vineyard workers to harvest without straining their bodies with excessive bending or reaching. Similarly, keeping the fruiting zone in a consistent spot on each vine {{makes it easier to}} set up machinery for pruning, spraying and harvesting.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the most}} {{pertinent}} purpose {{of establishing a}} <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> system is canopy management, especially dealing with shading, {{there are many other}} reasons that come into play. As members of the Vitis family, grapevines are climbing plants that do not have their own natural support like trees. While grapevines have woody trunks, the weight of a vine's leafy canopy and grape clusters will often bring the vine's cordon or [...] "arms" [...] down towards the ground unless it receives some form of support.|$|E
2500|$|The high {{humidity}} and propensity for harvest rains leads many growers to use open canopy management techniques and trellising {{as well as}} frequent leaf pulling {{in order to keep}} mould and rot at bay. Some examples of <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> systems found in the Hunter including the Scott Henry, Smart-Dyson and V-Trellis. In the Upper Hunter, the Vertical Shoot Positioning (VSP) is often used in areas that have problem with sunburn. [...] Despite the generally wet climate, irrigation is often used in the slightly drier Upper Hunter where the winter and early growing seasons are prone to drought.|$|E

50|$|Grateful {{dependence}} {{of a different}} sort was signified by the French emblem of Gilles Corrozet in his Hecatomographie (1540), where a fruiting vine acknowledges its debt to the little tree that supports it. In the following century an adaptation of the emblem was adopted as printers mark by the House of Elzevir for their press in Leiden.

2500|$|While Grüner Veltliner {{can grow}} {{on a variety}} of {{vineyard}} soils, wine expert Oz Clarke notes that the grape tends to thrive on soils with high loess content. While newer vineyards have been experimenting with a variety of <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> systems, in Austria Grüner Veltliner has been historically trained in the Lenz Moser style developed in the 1920s. Known as the [...] "high culture" [...] or Hochkultur method because of how relatively high (...) the vine trunk is allowed to grow, the goal is to reduce vine density by spacing the vines in wide rows that are 3.5 meters (11.5ft) apart.|$|E
2500|$|Like most New World wine regions, {{there is}} little to no {{government}} restrictions on the type of viticultural practices used in the Hunter Valley. Growers are free to plant whatever grape variety they wish, use any pruning or <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> system, and harvest as large or small of yields as they wish. To that extent, there is a wide range of viticultural practices seen in the Hunter Valley though some commonality does occur. [...] As with many areas of Australia with labour shortages, viticulture in the Hunter is highly mechanised with machine harvesting the norm and experiments in mechanical pruning and leaf pulling also widely practised. Harvest usually takes place from mid-January to early March.|$|E
2500|$|As a cool {{continental}} climate region, {{one of the}} main viticultural threats in Sancerre is springtime frost. Throughout most of the growing season the nearby Loire river to the east and forest to the west help moderate temperatures. Vine growers in the area tend to utilize cordon or single Guyot <b>vine</b> <b>training</b> and tailor their canopy management techniques to whichever style of Sauvignon blanc they are looking to produce. Grassy, herbaceous styles of Sauvignon blanc are more prevalent with large, leafy canopies, while producers wishing to minimize these qualities may need wide, open canopies. In cooler vintages, the growers may need to take the additional measures of leaf plucking and de-budding in order to thin out the canopy and produce more fruit concentrated grapes.|$|E
