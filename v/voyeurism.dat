5|$|The {{painting}} depicts 125 wedding guests. As was customary in the Renaissance period, the brides {{wore black}} and men wore codpieces. <b>Voyeurism</b> is depicted {{throughout the entire}} art work; dancing was disapproved of by the authorities and the church, and the painting {{can be seen as}} both a critique and comic depiction of a stereotypical oversexed, overindulgent, peasant class of the times.|$|E
5|$|The popular {{painting}} shows a {{group of}} 125 wedding guests wearing clothing from the times, presented in the canvas in an apparently chaotic way in an outdoor party surrounded by trees. The brides wore black {{as it was the}} Renaissance period and the men wore codpieces, which were an important part of their clothing at the time. <b>Voyeurism</b> (spying on people engaged in intimate behaviours) is shown throughout the entire work amongst almost all of the people.|$|E
5|$|Blending {{science fiction}} with film noir conventions, Strange Days explores themes such as racism, abuse of power, rape, and <b>voyeurism.</b> Although {{the story was}} {{conceived}} by Cameron around 1986, Bigelow found inspiration after incidents such as the Lorena Bobbitt trial and the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed the Rodney King verdict. The film was shot entirely in the Greater Los Angeles Area {{over a period of}} 77 nights. The film's SQUID scenes, which offer a point-of-view shot (POV), required multi-faceted cameras and considerable technical preparation.|$|E
5|$|S {{is about}} <b>voyeurism</b> {{as it relates}} to {{underground}} films. Interviews with horror film directors and Carol J. Clover, a writer on the horror genre, are weaved between clips from horror films. In the beginning of the film, clips show the directors and Clover commenting on a horror film that is not shown onscreen and with the title not mentioned. The film then moves on to Petty's meetings with Eric Rost (Erik Marcisak), Bill Zebub, and Fred Vogel. He interviews these men and actress Debbie D., while clips from horror films and facts and opinions provided by Clover about the genre are interspersed.|$|E
5|$|Some bathhouses have areas {{designed}} to facilitate impersonal sex. These areasrooms or hallwaysare illuminated {{only by a}} (dim) red exit sign. It is possible to have sex, but not to see with whom. Other bathhouses, such as the Continental Baths in New York or the Club Baths in Washington, D.C., have two or more bunkbeds in close proximity, in a public area. This provides a place to have sex for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated exhibitionism and <b>voyeurism</b> for those so inclined. Baths often have a (porn) TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{shows the}} moment at which Gyges, hiding behind the door, first catches sight of Nyssia's naked body. Candaules lies naked in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes around the door {{to catch a glimpse}} of her. Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a {{vertical}} line cutting off the body of Candaules at the top of his legs, invoking a theme of emasculation at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of <b>voyeurism</b> and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|E

25|$|Bond's book {{of street}} {{photography}} Point and Shoot, {{was published by}} German fine arts publisher Hatje Cantz Verlag, in 2000; many of the images included imitate forms of photography that are derided or taboo, such as <b>voyeurism</b> and paparazzi photojournalism; other images are grainy and suggest surveillance or CCTV images—the photographer is either an intrusive, prying, nuisance, or else reduced to an automaton-like spectator on daily life.|$|E

In the 1990s, Bond was a photojournalist working for British fashion, music, and youth culture magazine The Face. In 1998, his photobook of street fashions in London The Cult of the Street was published. His Point and Shoot (Cantz, 2000), explored the photo-genres of surveillance, <b>voyeurism</b> and paparazzi photojournalism.|$|E
25|$|The Singapore Police Force {{maintains}} a wholesome image {{across the entire}} island and is known for being clean and upright. However the rare and occasional controversies remain debated in the parliament or the courts, some that result in conviction. As a conviction example, <b>voyeurism</b> by male police serviceman on fellow female police officers do happen {{as in the case}} of Abdul Qayyum Mohd Hashim who was imprisoned nine months from 17 March 2016 after 11 charges of taking photographs of a nude female police constable showering and theft of a brassiere.|$|E
25|$|Many {{places have}} laws prohibiting photographing private areas under a person's {{clothing}} without that person's permission. This {{also applies to}} any filming of another within a public restroom or locker room. Some jurisdictions have banned {{the use of a}} telephone with camera functionality within a restroom or locker room in order to prevent this. The United States enacted the Video <b>Voyeurism</b> Prevention Act of 2004 to punish those who intentionally capture an individual's private areas without consent, when the person knew the subject had an expectation of privacy. State laws have also been passed addressing this issue.|$|E
25|$|In India {{after the}} 2012 Delhi gang rape case {{amendments}} {{were made to}} the laws concerning rape with more specific protocols towards the trial proceedings. The new law, Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2013, also defines new crimes such as stalking and <b>voyeurism,</b> expands the definition of rape, and brings higher sentences for punishment of the offenders (such as the death penalty for repeated offenders and for cases resulting in the victim's death). The law was passed by India's Parliament on March 2013, and with the passing of this law, it is also a crime for the police to refuse to open cases for sexual attack allegations.|$|E
25|$|On 19 March 2013, the Indian Parliament {{passed a}} new law {{with the goal of}} more {{effectively}} protecting women from sexual violence in India.

The law makes stalking, <b>voyeurism,</b> acid attacks and forcibly disrobing a woman explicit crimes for the first time, provides capital punishment for rapes leading to death, and raises to 20 years from 10 the minimum sentence for gang rape and rapes committed by a police officer. The new law doesn’t address marital rape, rape committed by the armed forces or rape against men.|$|E
500|$|According to Jayson Rodriguez of MTV, {{the video}} is [...] "a mix of goth bondage-esque <b>voyeurism,</b> {{complete}} with Rihanna's gyrating moves and a raging band that features Travis Barker on the drums." [...] Shortly after the video was released, Slash {{said that he was}} [...] "flattered" [...] that Rihanna had impersonated him in the video, saying [...] "The video is way better with her being me than with me being me...all things considered, it brings an element of sexuality to it that I probably wouldn't have been capable of.

500|$|According to Williams, A Free Ride is a typological {{representative}} of a genre of early pornographic movies that included <b>voyeurism.</b> The film also shows sexual intercourse, fellatio, troilism, and urolagnia. Like the Argentinian film El Satario (c. 1907–15) and the German film Am Abend (c. 1910), A Free Ride begins with simple narrative frames, then shows signs of more conventional cinema for a short period, and finally shows hardcore scenes in a fragmented manner. Author Laurence O'Toole has described early stag films such as A Free Ride as [...] "a muddle of jerky camerawork and slipshod editing". However, like other stag films from the 1910s, this film is of superior quality to the non-commercial pornography which preceded it.|$|E
500|$|On 16 December 2013, {{the one-year}} {{anniversary of the}} rape was commemorated in London with a public {{memorial}} to honor the victim. Speakers included Meera Syal, whose parents are from New Delhi. Speaking of the anger that was expressed {{at the time of}} the rape, she said, [...] "We need to hold onto that anger and demand that the Indian Government enforces all the promised changes of its recent Criminal Law Amendment Act, which changed laws to expand the definition of rape and incorporated new offences including acid attack, sexual harassment, <b>voyeurism</b> and stalking". She also said that activists need to act in solidarity with other organisations to stop violence against women and girls around the world.|$|E

[...] The latter track was previously featured on Come On Pilgrim, and appears on Surfer Rosa as a rerecorded version of the original song. Many of the themes explored on previous recordings are revisited on Surfer Rosa; however, unlike on the band's later albums, the songs in Surfer Rosa are not preoccupied with one overarching topic.|$|E
500|$|The film explores {{controversial}} themes such as racism, {{abuse of}} power, and rape. <b>Voyeurism</b> {{is also a}} major element due to the protagonist's extensive use of SQUID technology. The fact that the film was directed by a woman was even more controversial, with film critic Michael Mirasol noting that had Strange Days been directed by a man, these scenes would likely have been criticized as sexist and misogynistic. Nevertheless, Bigelow insisted that the film does not glorify violence {{and that it has}} a positive purpose. According to her, [...] "I wanted to treat 'the system' fairly, because if it's the enemy, then we're the enemy, since by not changing it we're reproducing it... The film ends in a strong insistence on hope. Ultimately it's humanity - not technology - that takes us into the next century and the next millennium." ...|$|E
500|$|Du Bois {{frequently}} promoted African-American artistic {{creativity in}} his writings, {{and when the}} Harlem Renaissance emerged in the mid-1920s, his article [...] "A Negro Art Renaissance" [...] celebrated {{the end of the}} long hiatus of blacks from creative endeavors.Horne, Malika, [...] "Art and Artists", in Young, pp. 13–15.Lewis, p. 475 (article). His enthusiasm for the Harlem Renaissance waned as he came to believe that many whites visited Harlem for <b>voyeurism,</b> not for genuine appreciation of black art.Lewis, p. 480. Du Bois insisted that artists recognize their moral responsibilities, writing that [...] "a black artist is first of all a black artist." [...] He was also concerned that black artists were not using their art to promote black causes, saying [...] "I do not care a damn for any art that is not used for propaganda." [...] By the end of 1926, he stopped employing The Crisis to support the arts.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Dr. No—and {{unconnected}} with the book itself—Bernard Bergonzi, in the March 1958 issue of Twentieth Century, attacked Fleming's work, saying that it contained [...] "a strongly marked streak of <b>voyeurism</b> and sado-masochism" [...] and that the books showed [...] "the total lack of any ethical frame of reference". The article also compared Fleming unfavourably to John Buchan and Raymond Chandler in both moral and literary measures. The writer Simon Raven, while appreciating Bergonzi had produced a [...] "quiet and well-argued article", thought that the critic's conclusion was naïve, and asked [...] "Since when has it been remarkable in a work of entertainment that it should lack a specific 'ethical frame of reference'?" [...] Raven continued, saying Fleming [...] "by reason of his cool and analytical intelligence, his informed use of technical facts, his plausibility, sense of pace, brilliant descriptive powers and superb imagination, provides sheer entertainment such as I, who must read many novels, am seldom lucky enough to find".|$|E
500|$|Review {{aggregator}} Metacritic {{shows an}} average score rating of 76 out of 100 {{for both the}} PS2 and Xbox versions, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Marc Saltzman of CNN wrote: [...] "Unlike Hollywood horror movies that often get worse with each new sequel ("," [...] for example), Konami's scary Silent Hill series gets better -- and creepier -- with age." [...] Video game magazine Game Informer praised Silent Hill 4: The Room, stating that its [...] "disarming <b>voyeurism,</b> bizarre camera angles, and exceptionally well-placed tension is what the series {{has been trying to}} do all along, but The Room is the first entry to do it right." [...] According to a reviewer for Edge magazine, [...] "ook at it one way, and it's a choking journey with unprecedented attention to unease and psychological horror, a game framed with unparalleled sophistication. From another angle, it's just a clunky PSone throwback, with all the design wit of a dodo." [...] The New York Times found it completely lacking in [...] "true terror." ...|$|E
500|$|True Blue {{also made}} social impact through its music videos, as author John E. Semonche {{observed}} {{in his book}} Censoring Sex that Madonna pushed the envelope {{of what could be}} shown on television which resulted in increase of her popularity. The music video for [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] was a subject of analysis among scholars for its concept of the stereo-typical male gaze and <b>voyeurism.</b> She appeared as a stripper in the video, who escapes with a young boy from the strip parlour in the end. MTV had some reservations initially before airing the video, which was later resolved after a meeting with Warner Officials. Feminist writer Susan Bordo reacted negatively to the video, saying that the leering and pathetic men in the cubicles and Madonna's escape with the boy is [...] "cynically and mechanically tacked on [...] a way of claiming trendy status for what is just cheesecake—or, perhaps, pornography". Author Donn Welton pointed out that the usual power relationship between the [...] "voyeuristic male gaze and object" [...] is destabilized by the portrayal of the male patrons of the peep show as leering and pathetic.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Popular Mechanics named The Truman Show {{as one of}} the 10 most prophetic {{science fiction}} films. Journalist Erik Sofge argued that the story {{reflects}} the falseness of reality television. [...] "Truman simply lives, and the show's popularity is its straightforward <b>voyeurism.</b> And, like Big Brother, Survivor, and every other reality show on the air, none of his environment is actually real." [...] He deemed it an eerie coincidence that Big Brother made its debut a year after the film's release, and he also compared the film to the 2003 program The Joe Schmo Show: [...] "Unlike Truman, Matt Gould could see the cameras, but all of the other contestants were paid actors, playing the part of various reality-show stereotypes. While Matt eventually got all of the prizes in the rigged contest, the show's central running joke was in the same existential ballpark as The Truman Show." [...] Weir declared, [...] "There has always been this question: Is the audience getting dumber? Or are we filmmakers patronizing them? Is this what they want? Or is this what we're giving them? But the public went to my film in large numbers. And that has to be encouraging." ...|$|E
500|$|Of Etty's two {{original}} works {{exhibited at}} the RA in 1830, The Storm, inspired by Psalm 22, attracted little interest and was dismissed by The Gentleman's Magazine—typically a staunch supporter of Etty's work—as [...] "a sad failure". The other painting exhibited was Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed, which was to prove {{one of the most}} controversial works of Etty's career. Candaules is based on a story from Herodotus in which king Candaules arranges for his servant Gyges to spy on his wife Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Gyges is discovered and at Nyssia's behest kills Candaules, marries Nyssia and rules the kingdom in his stead. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia removes the last of her clothes. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty aimed for the viewer to feel the same sense of <b>voyeurism</b> and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge.|$|E
500|$|Critics have {{identified}} various major themes in Tenebrae. In interviews {{conducted during the}} film's production, the usually somewhat reticent Argento offered his candid views on the thematic content of the film. As biographer Maitland McDonagh noted in Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento, [...] "...Argento {{has never been more}} articulate and/or analytical than he was on the subject of Tenebrae." [...] Film scholar William Hope considers the film to be devoid of classical narrative progression, and states that the characters [...] "lack a narrative function or purpose, existing only to be killed in a spectacular fashion, their death hardly moving the narrative on at all. Traditional cause and effect are seemingly forgotten or actively ignored". According to James Gracey, author of a book about Argento's work, with Tenebrae Argento [...] "explores some of his most reoccurring themes and preoccupations, such as Freudian psychology, sexual deviancy, repressed trauma, <b>voyeurism,</b> audience spectatorship and the fetishisation of violence and death." [...] Water is often associated visually with Neal; in almost all his scenes his appearance is followed or accompanied by a shot of water. Later, this device is used repeatedly as a clue to the ultimate killer's identity – Neal himself.|$|E
500|$|The {{video is}} {{structured}} as a cinematic peep show and <b>voyeurism</b> that portrays Madonna as a stripper. According to Mondino, the peep show {{was his idea}} since at that time, [...] "we were into a period where we were experimenting [...] some kind of freedom about the body, about sexuality and stuff". He {{wanted to have a}} [...] "naive and sweet" [...] feel with the portrayal of a boy waiting outside for Madonna. They built the set from scratch, including the frontal part with the ticket booth. Although it looked fake, Mondino liked it saying [...] "I like the fakeness of it. I haven't seen it for a long time, but when I saw it once again, I said, 'It's so naïve'. It's kind of badly done, which I like, compared to today. We didn't have the same equipment, people are more skillful today, but there's something sweet about it." [...] Madonna was initially asked by him to wear a black wig, and the initial reaction to the whole wardrobe was positive. But Madonna wanted Mondino's opinion on the whole ensemble, who replied that she would look better as a blonde. So the wig was kept for the initial scenes of the video only.|$|E
500|$|Although {{none of his}} {{features}} display graphic sex scenes, sexuality in Kubrick's films is usually depicted outside matrimonial relationships in hostile situations. Baxter states that Kubrick explores the [...] "furtive and violent side alleys of the sexual experience: <b>voyeurism,</b> domination, bondage and rape" [...] in his films. He further points out that films like A Clockwork Orange are [...] "powerfully homoerotic", from Alex walking about his parents' flat in his Y-fronts, one eye being [...] "made up with doll-like false eyelashes", to his innocent acceptance of the sexual advances of his post-corrective adviser Deltroid (Aubrey Morris). British critic Adrian Turner notes that Kubrick's films appear to be [...] "preoccupied with questions of universal and inherited evil", and Malcolm McDowell referred to his humor as [...] "black as coal", questioning his outlook on humanity. Although {{a few of his}} pictures were obvious satires and black comedies, such as Lolita and Dr. Strangelove, many of his other films also contained less visible elements of satire or irony. His films are unpredictable, examining [...] "the duality and contradictions that exist in all of us". Ciment notes how Kubrick often tried to confound audience expectations by establishing radically different moods from one film to the next, remarking that he was almost [...] "obsessed with contradicting himself, with making each work a critique of the previous one".|$|E
500|$|Jeffrey and Sandy attend Dorothy's nightclub act, {{in which}} she sings [...] "Blue Velvet," [...] and leave early so Jeffrey can sneak into her {{apartment}} to snoop. He hurriedly hides in a closet when she returns home. However, Dorothy, wielding a knife, discovers him and threatens to kill him. Believing his curiosity is merely sexual and aroused by his <b>voyeurism,</b> Dorothy makes Jeffrey undress at knife-point and begins to fellate him before their encounter is interrupted by {{a knock at the}} door. Dorothy hides Jeffrey in the closet. From there he witnesses the visitor, Frank Booth, inflict his bizarre sexual proclivities—which include inhaling an unidentified gas, dry humping, and sadomasochism—upon Dorothy. Frank is an extremely foul-mouthed, violent man whose orgasmic climax is a fit of both pleasure and rage. He continually refers to her as [...] "Mommy" [...] and to himself as both the [...] "Daddy" [...] and the [...] "Baby," [...] who [...] "wants to fuck." [...] Frank has kidnapped Dorothy's husband and son to force her to perform sexual favors; to [...] "Do it for van Gogh." [...] When Frank leaves, a sad and desperate Dorothy tries to seduce Jeffrey again and demands that he hit her, but when he refuses, she tells him to leave. When Jeffrey moves to leave, she asks him to stay, though he leaves anyway.|$|E
500|$|Since the mid-1930s, Widmerpool's {{political}} leanings {{have been}} generally to the left, (possibly {{as a result}} of [...] his brief association with the radical Gypsy Jones in the late 1920s). In 1945 he becomes a Labour Member of Parliament during the postwar Attlee government and eventually receives (unspecified) minor ministerial office in the administration. He {{is also one of the}} backers of a left-leaning magazine, Fission, through which he hopes to propagate his economic and political views. He is an assiduous promoter of good relations with eastern European countries and is suspected by some of a secret communist allegiance. After losing his parliamentary seat in the 1955 General Election Widmerpool continues to promote east–west friendship and trade and is thought to have become wealthy as a result. Doubts as to his motives remain and rumours connect him with Burgess and Maclean. In 1958, Widmerpool is appointed a life peer and takes his seat in the House of Lords. His eastern European activities again arouse suspicion, questions are asked in parliament and it seems likely that he will be charged with spying but the investigation is dropped without explanation. His marriage to Pamela is disintegrating; for years he has tolerated her constant infidelities and she publicly accuses him of <b>voyeurism.</b> After Pamela's sudden death in 1959, Widmerpool leaves the country to take up an academic post in California.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} five books (Casino Royale, Live and Let Die, Moonraker, Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love) Fleming {{received}} broadly positive reviews. That began to change in March 1958 when Bernard Bergonzi, in the journal Twentieth Century, attacked Fleming's work as containing [...] "a strongly marked streak of <b>voyeurism</b> and sado-masochism" [...] and wrote that the books showed [...] "the total lack of any ethical frame of reference". The article compared Fleming unfavourably with John Buchan and Raymond Chandler on both moral and literary criteria. A month later, Dr. No was published, and Fleming received harsh criticism {{from a number of}} reviewers who, in the words of Ben Macintyre, [...] "rounded on Fleming, almost as a pack". The most strongly worded of the critiques came from Paul Johnson of the New Statesman, who, in his review [...] "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism", called the novel [...] "without doubt, the nastiest book I have ever read". Johnson {{went on to say that}} [...] "by the time I was a third of the way through, I had to suppress a strong impulse to throw the thing away". Although Johnson recognised that in Bond there [...] "was a social phenomenon of some importance", this was seen as a negative element, as the phenomenon concerned [...] "three basic ingredients in Dr No, all unhealthy, all thoroughly English: the sadism of a schoolboy bully, the mechanical, two-dimensional sex-longings of a frustrated adolescent, and the crude, snob-cravings of a suburban adult." [...] Johnson saw no positives in Dr. No, and said, [...] "Mr Fleming has no literary skill, the construction of the book is chaotic, and entire incidents and situations are inserted, and then forgotten, in a haphazard manner." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{in many of}} Argento's films, {{which tend}} to eroticize the murder of {{beautiful}} women, gender, sexuality and power are major issues foregrounded by the film. The fictional novel within the film is described as being [...] "about human perversion {{and its effects on}} society". Male and female sexual deviancy are a central theme, with the victims being sexually liberated women who the first killer – conservative TV presenter Cristiano Berti – refers to as [...] "filthy, slimy perverts". The first victim is a sexually promiscuous shoplifter, and his next two are the lesbian reporter and her bisexual lover. Berti murders the comparatively normal Maria only because she inadvertently discovers his twisted compulsion. His [...] "moral crusade" [...] is inspired by – and in his mind given credibility by – Neal's novel. Neal's own motivations for becoming a killer are revealed in [...] "Freudian flashbacks". As summarized by McDonagh, these flashbacks [...] "expose how the misogyny evident in his books actually stems from being sexually humiliated by a beautiful woman in his youth." [...] McDonagh also notes that Tenebrae expands on the themes of sexuality and transvestitism found in Argento's earlier films, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, The Cat o' Nine Tails, Four Flies on Grey Velvet (1972), and Deep Red (1975), but believes that Tenebraes [...] "overall sensuality sets it apart from Argento's other gialli." [...] She says that the film's sexual content and abundant nudity make it [...] "the first of Argento's films to have an overtly erotic aspect", and further notes that [...] "Tenebrae is fraught with free-floating anxiety that is specifically sexual in nature." [...] Gracey notes that in several scenes the victims gaze directly into the camera, which demonstrates Argento's [...] "preoccupation with <b>voyeurism</b> and spectacle".|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented, [...] "If 2001's Britney was a {{transitional}} album, capturing Spears {{at the point}} when she wasn't a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, In the Zone, is where she has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman." [...] Erlewine compared Spears to her peer Christina Aguilera, explaining that both equated maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs, but while Aguilera [...] "comes across like a natural-born skank, Britney is {{the girl next door}} cutting loose at college, drinking and smoking and dancing and sexing just a little too recklessly, since {{this is the first time}} she can indulge herself." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated, [...] "For a girl who's always seemed too sexed-up for her age, In the Zone finds Britney finally filling her britches, so-to-speak. Her little girl coquettishness actually works now—maybe because, at 21, she's finally a woman." [...] Jason King of Vibe said the album showcased a transformed Spears, [...] "no longer a girl, and all the woman any man can handle." [...] In 2009, Amy Schriefer of NPR listed the album on The 50 Most Important Recordings of the Decade list. Calling it [...] "a primer on the sound of pop in the '00s", she deemed Spears as the ideal vehicle for a futuristic sound, since she was still trying to break away from her teen pop past. Schriefer praised [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Everytime", and also stated, [...] "While the decade's history of celebrity obsession, paparazzi <b>voyeurism</b> and conflicted constructions of female sexuality and motherhood are written on Spears' body, the decade's history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work." ...|$|E
