2500|$|In late 1939, the View-Master was {{introduced}} at the New York World's Fair (marked [...] "Patent Applied For"). It {{was intended as}} an alternative to the scenic postcard, and was originally sold at photography shops, stationery stores, and scenic-attraction gift shops. The main subjects of the first View-Master reels were Carlsbad Caverns and the Grand Canyon. The View-Master was marketed through the photo-finishing, postcard, and greeting-card company, Sawyer's,Inc. The partnership led to the retail sales of View-Master viewers and disks. The patent on the <b>viewing</b> <b>device</b> was issued in 1940, on what came to be called the ModelA viewer. Within a very short time, the View-Master took over the postcard business as Sawyer's biggest and most profitable product area. [...] The company continued to make other photographic products, however, including about 30million postcards per year and about 1.5million photographic greeting cards per year.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. Aims To {{establish}} whether lower resolution, lower cost <b>viewing</b> <b>devices</b> {{have the potential}} to deliver mammographic interpretation training. Methods On three occasions over eight months, fourteen consultant radiologists and reporting radiographers read forty challenging digital mammography screening cases on three different displays: a digital mammography workstation, a standard LCD monitor, and a smartphone. Standard image manipulation software was available for use on all three devices. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) were used to determine the significance of differences in performance between the <b>viewing</b> <b>devices</b> with/without the application of image manipulation software. The effect of reader’s experience was also assessed. Results Performance was significantly higher (p<. 05) on the mammography workstation compared to the other two <b>viewing</b> <b>devices.</b> When image manipulation software was applied to images viewed on the standard LCD monitor, performance improved to mirror levels seen on the mammography workstation with {{no significant difference between the}} two. Image interpretation on the smartphone was uniformly poor. Film reader experience had no significant effect on performance across all three <b>viewing</b> <b>devices.</b> Conclusion Lower resolution standard LCD monitors combined with appropriate image manipulation software are capable of displaying mammographic pathology, and are potentially suitable for delivering mammographic interpretation training. Key points • This study investigates potential devices for training in mammography interpretation. • Lower resolution standard LCD monitors are potentially suitable for mammographic interpretation training. • The effect of image manipulation tools on mammography workstation viewing is insignificant. • Reader experience had no significant effect on performance in all <b>viewing</b> <b>devices.</b> • Smart phones are not suitable for displaying mammograms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{emerging}} SVC standard enables {{partial extraction}} and decoding of video bitstreams, and thus allows various <b>viewing</b> <b>devices</b> to adapt their video reception and playback according to devices capability and network performance. This desirable feature, however, {{comes with a}} caveat: the parts of a bitstream needed for providing good quality playback at different devices may differ significantly depending on the visual characteristics of video programs, the quantization and dependency settings of SVC encoders {{as well as the}} display formats of <b>viewing</b> <b>devices.</b> In this paper, we present the results of our preliminary investigation on the intricate relations among these factors. We discovered a set of constraints on the setting of quantization parameters and the choices of reference layers for inter-layer dependencies that ensures good rate-distortion trade-offs and regular bitstream extraction paths. We called these constraints, the adaptation rules for inter-layer encoding, and their resulting outputs, the well-adapted layers/bitstreams. We further discovered that bitstream extraction by different <b>viewing</b> <b>devices</b> follow predictable paths if the SVC bitstream is well-adapted and the playback process extracts a complete set of interdependent network abstraction layer (NAL) units in every refinement step. These regular extraction paths enabled us to develop an efficient bitstream extraction algorithm based on local optimization of rate-distortion ratios. The experimental results using standard testing sequences confirmed our findings...|$|R
