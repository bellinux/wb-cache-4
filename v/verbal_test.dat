As of 2014, Alexander and the DRLRL had developed a linguistic counterpart to the TORR, the <b>verbal</b> <b>Test</b> of Relational Reasoning (vTORR), and testing of a version of the original TORR for elementary students, called the TORR Junior is currently underway.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the {{relationship}} between proprioceptive and <b>verbal</b> <b>tests</b> on personality in both sexes separately due to existing proprioceptive differences in fine motor behavior between men and women in our previous studies [1, 2, 3]. Material and methods. 114 middle-aged participants from Belarus completed <b>verbal</b> <b>tests</b> (personality: Eysenck's EPQ, Big Five in Hromov's Russian adaptation, and Rosenberg's Self-esteem) together with Proprioceptive Diagnostics of Temperament and Character (by Tous). Complementary information, such as tests of time perception, was collected and used in correlative and ANOVA analyses with the use of SPSS v. 19. Results. The relationship between proprioceptive variables in personality and individual differences, time perception and the results of <b>verbal</b> <b>tests</b> were determined for each sex subgroup and discussed. ANOVA results reflected the corresponding differences and similarities between men and women in the variables of each test. Time perception was found to be significantly correlated to all five dimensions of the Big Five Test in both sexes, and both had a significant relationship to the same variables of the DP-TC test. Conclusions. Time perception can be used as an indirect indicator of personality. Existing individual and personality differences should be taken into account in coaching and education to obtain more effective results...|$|R

50|$|Later studies {{established}} {{the validity of}} the test as a sensitive tool. Many early comparisons with other intelligence tests found moderate to high correlation coefficients. As a nonverbal test it was not expected to have a high correlation with <b>verbal</b> <b>tests,</b> but the correlation is at least moderately positive.|$|R
50|$|The {{computer-based}} verbal sections assess reading comprehension, critical reasoning, {{and vocabulary}} usage. The <b>verbal</b> <b>test</b> is {{scored on a}} scale of 130-170, in 1-point increments (Before August, 2011 the scale was 200-800, in 10-point increments). In a typical examination, each verbal section consists of 20 questions to be completed in 30 minutes. Each verbal section consists of about 6 text completion, 4 sentence equivalence, and 10 critical reading questions. The changes in 2011 include a reduced emphasis on rote vocabulary knowledge and the elimination of antonyms and analogies. Text completion items have replaced sentence completions and new reading question types allowing for the selection of multiple answers were added.|$|E
50|$|Claude M. Steele and Joshua Aronson {{conducted}} the first experiments showing that stereotype threat can depress intellectual performance on standardized tests. In one study, {{they found that}} black college students performed worse than white students on a <b>verbal</b> <b>test</b> when the task was framed {{as a measure of}} intelligence. When it was not presented in that manner, the performance gap narrowed. Subsequent experiments showed that framing the test as diagnostic of intellectual ability made black students more aware of negative stereotypes about their group, which in turn impaired their performance. Stereotype threat effects have been demonstrated for an array of social groups in many different arenas, including not only academics but also sports, chess and business.|$|E

50|$|The WAIS-R, {{a revised}} {{form of the}} WAIS, was {{released}} in 1981 and consisted of six verbal and five performance subtests. The <b>verbal</b> <b>tests</b> were: Information, Comprehension, Arithmetic, Digit Span, Similarities, and Vocabulary. The Performance subtests were: Picture Arrangement, Picture Completion, Block Design, Object Assembly, and Digit Symbol. A verbal IQ, performance IQ and full scale IQ were obtained.|$|R
50|$|The {{best way}} to see if anomic aphasia has {{developed}} is by using verbal as well as imaging tests. The {{combination of the two}} tests seem to be most effective, since either test done alone may give false positives or false negatives. For example, the <b>verbal</b> <b>test</b> is used {{to see if there is}} a speech disorder, and whether it is a problem in speech production or in comprehension. Patients with Alzheimer's disease have speech problems that are linked to dementia or progressive aphasias which can include anomia. The imaging test, mostly done using MRI scans, is ideal for lesion mapping or viewing deterioration in the brain. However, imaging cannot diagnose anomia on its own because the lesions may not be located deep enough to damage the white matter or damage the arcuate fasciculus. However, anomic aphasia is very difficult to associate with a specific lesion location in the brain. Therefore, the combination of speech tests and imaging tests has the highest sensitivity and specificity.|$|E

5000|$|Robert Yerkes and a {{committee}} of six representatives developed two intelligence tests; the Army Alpha test and the Army Beta test to help the United States Military screen incoming soldiers for [...] "intellectual deficiencies, psychopathic tendencies, nervous intangibility, and inadequate self-control". [...] The Alpha test was a <b>verbal</b> <b>test</b> for literate recruits and was divided into eight test categories, which included: following oral directions, arithmetical problems, practical judgments, synonyms and antonyms, disarranged sentences, number series completion, analogies and information, whereas the Beta test was a nonverbal test used for testing illiterate or non-English speaking recruits. The Beta test did not require those being tested to use written language, but rather the examinees completed tasks by using visual aids. The Beta Intelligence test was divided into seven subtests, which included: [...] "Test 1- assessed the ability of army recruits to trace {{the path of a}} maze; Test 2- assessed the ability of cube analysis; Test 3-assessed the ability of pattern analysis using an X-O series; Test 4- assessed the ability of coding digits with symbols; Test 5- assessed the ability of number checking; Test 6-assessed the ability of pictorial completion; and Test 7- assessed the ability of geometrical construction".|$|E

5000|$|The WSC task is a <b>verbal</b> <b>test</b> of perceptual {{implicit}} memory. In {{this task}} a participant is {{presented with the}} first few letters of a word and {{asked to complete the}} word stem with the first word that they can think of. The participants are usually unaware that they have to complete these tasks using words that they have previously seen. An example of a WSC task would be presenting the word [...] "lettuce" [...] {{in such a way that}} a participant was not aware that this word would be useful later. After a given time the participant would be given the word stem [...] "LET____" [...] and asked to complete it with the first word that comes to mind. Participants are using their implicit memory if they complete the word stem with the previously presented word, in this case lettuce. To construct a WSC task for a study, researchers will usually use a thesaurus to generate a large pool of words, including both general words and the words to be primed. With the use of a dictionary, this pool of words is slowly reduced to a smaller amount. Using information from pilot testing the smaller pool is shrunken to the desired number of word stems for the test.|$|E
5000|$|In England, {{studies by}} the National Literacy Trust have shown girls score {{consistently}} higher than boys in all scholastic areas from the ages of 7 through 16, with the most striking differences noted in reading and writing skills. In the United States, historically, girls lagged on standardized tests. In 1996 the average score of 503 for US girls from all races on the SAT <b>verbal</b> <b>test</b> was 4 points lower than boys. In math, the average for girls was 492, which was 35 points lower than boys. [...] "When girls take the exact same courses," [...] commented Wayne Camara, a research scientist with the College Board, [...] "that 35-point gap dissipates quite a bit." [...] At the time Leslie R. Wolfe, president of the Center for Women Policy Studies said girls scored differently on the math tests {{because they tend to}} work the problems out while boys use [...] "test-taking tricks" [...] such as immediately checking the answers already given in multiple-choice questions. Wolfe said girls are steady and thorough while [...] "boys play this test like a pin-ball machine." [...] Wolfe also said although girls had lower SAT scores they consistently get higher grades than boys across all courses in their first year in college. By 2006 girls were outscoring boys on the verbal portion of the United States' nationwide SAT exam by 11 points. A 2005 University of Chicago study showed that a majority presence of girls in the classroom tends to enhance the academic performance of boys.|$|E

In this paper, we assessed the performance of Asian-American women on a <b>verbal</b> <b>test,</b> {{a situation in which the}} valence of the stereotypes associated with the same two identities (i. e.

To examine this issue, a study was conducted to investigate whether stereotype threat's adverse effects are reduced when a Black experimenter administers a <b>verbal</b> <b>test</b> to Black participants. We further examined the question of whether Black participants have a subjective awareness of stereotype threat. Results showed that when a Black experimenter gave a <b>verbal</b> <b>test</b> to Black participants, they did not suffer the typical performance decrements associated with stereotype threat.
