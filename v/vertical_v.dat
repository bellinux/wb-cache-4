40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new and more {{efficient}} approach for computing the well known structure called Principal Partition of a graph. The Principal Partition Problem is to find for each #kappa#, the collection of all sets X which maximize vertical stroke X vertical stroke -#kappa#*r(X) over the subsets of the edges of a graph whose rank is given by r(.). Our approach is based on implicitely finding a suitable partition of the vertex set, this differs from the conventional approaches reported in the literature to date. This approach results in an algorithm for this problem, which runs in O(vertical stroke E parallel <b>V</b> <b>vertical</b> stroke " 2 log" 2 <b>vertical</b> stroke <b>V</b> <b>vertical</b> stroke) time for unweighted graphs and O(vertical stroke E parallel <b>V</b> <b>vertical</b> stroke " 3 log <b>vertical</b> stroke <b>V</b> <b>vertical</b> stroke) for weighted graphs.

50|$|Group cohesion, as a scientifically studied {{property}} of groups, is {{commonly associated with}} Kurt Lewin and his student, Leon Festinger. Lewin defined group cohesion as the willingness of individuals to stick together, and believed that without cohesiveness a group could not exist. As an extension of Lewin’s work, Festinger (along with Stanley Schachter and Kurt Back) described cohesion as, “the total field of forces which act on members {{to remain in the}} group” (Festinger, Schachter, & Back, 1950, p. 37). Later, this definition was modified to describe the forces acting on individual members to remain in the group, termed attraction to the group. Since then, several models for understanding the concept of group cohesion have been developed, including Albert Carron’s hierarchical model and several bi-dimensional models (<b>vertical</b> <b>v.</b> horizontal cohesion, task v. social cohesion, belongingness and morale, and personal v. social attraction). Before Lewin and Festinger, there were, of course, descriptions of a very similar group property. For example, Emile Durkheim described two forms of solidarity (mechanical and organic), which created a sense of collective conscious and an emotion-based sense of community.|$|E

It had a wing of similar form to the T 19, with a centre section with a constant chord centre section and outboard taper on both edges plus ailerons with extended curved trailing edges. Its span, though, was increased by 2.50 m. The forward V cabane struts joining the centre section to upper fuselage longerons were {{similar to those of the}} T 19, but the T 23 had a pair of single rear struts more like those of the T 21. The parasol wing was a typically Junkers cantilever structure requiring no outboard struts on the T 2E, but on the T 23D the lower wing was mounted below the fuselage and braced to the upper one by a pair of <b>vertical</b> <b>V</b> struts near the lower wing tips. The lower wing had a span only 77% that of the upper one, increasing the total wing area by 57% and adding 75 kg to the structural weight.|$|E

40|$|Sea {{surface wind}} speed (SSW) is {{retrieved}} mainly from 37 GHz <b>vertical</b> (<b>V)</b> and horizontal (H) brightness temperature of AMSR/AMSR-E by a graphical method. The retrieval {{is restricted to}} no rain condition, since the brightness temperature of 37 GHz is saturated under rainy condition, SSW obtained from 37 GHz has a large anisotropic feature depending on an angle difference between antenna direction and wind direction. Its anisotropic feature is corrected by using two data from 37 and 10 GHz, since 10 GHz data are less anisotropic. Even under rainy condition, 10 and 6 GHz data are not saturated, so wind speed {{will be able to}} be retrieved by using those horizontal data. Retrieval accuracy of wind speed using 10 and 6 GHz will become worse than using 37 GHz, since a sensitivity of 10 and 6 GHz to wind speed is not so strong. 2.
