This work is directed towards the development of a fault-free model of the pneumatic subsystem of the air brake system. This model can be used in brake control and diagnostic applications.

The long-term objective is to develop a model-based, performance-based diagnostic system that will automate enforcement inspections and help in monitoring the condition of the air brake system.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a mathematical model for an air brake system in the presence of leaks. Brake systems in trucks are crucial for ensuring the safety of vehicles and passengers on the roadways. Most trucks in the US are equipped with S-cam drum brake systems and they are sensitive to maintenance. Brake defects such as leaks are a major cause of accidents involving trucks. Leaks in the air brake systems affect braking performance drastically by decreasing the peak braking pressures attained and also increasing the time required to attain the same, thereby resulting in longer stopping distances. Hence {{there is a need for}} detecting leaks in an air brake system. In this thesis, a mathematical model for an air brake system in the presence of leaks is developed with a view towards developing an automatic leak detection system in the near future. The model developed here builds on an earlier research at Texas A&M University in which a "fault free" model of an air brake system is developed, i. e., a mathematical model of an air brake system that predicts how the pressure in the brake chamber evolves as a function of the brake pedal input when there are no leaks in the air brake system. In order to develop a model for an air brake system in the presence of leaks, one must characterize a "leak". A leak may be characterized by the location and its size. Since the pipes are short, the location of the leak does not significantly affect the evolution in the brake pressure as much as its size. For this reason, "effective area" of the leak was chosen as a characteristic of the leak. It was estimated by fitting an empirical relation for leak with leak flow measurement data. The supply pressure and effective area of leak comprised the inputs to the model along with the displacement of the foot pedal (treadle <b>valve</b> <b>plunger).</b> The model was corroborated with the experimental data collected using the setup at Texas A&M University...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the development of a model-based diagnostic system for air brake systems that are widely used in commercial vehicles, such as trucks, tractor-trailers, buses, etc. The performance of these brake systems is sensitive to maintenance and hence they require frequent inspections. Current inspection techniques require an inspector to go underneath a vehicle to check the brake system for possible faults, such as leaks, worn brake pads, out-of-adjustment of push rods, etc. Such inspections are time consuming, labor intensive and difficult to perform on vehicles with a low ground clearance. In this context, the development of an onboard/ handheld diagnostic tool for air brakes would be of significant value. Such a tool would automate the brake inspection process, thereby reducing the inspection time and improving the safety of operation of commercial vehicles. In this dissertation, diagnostic schemes are developed to automatically detect two important and prevalent faults that can occur in air brake systems ?????? leaks and out-of-adjustment of push rods. These diagnostic schemes are developed based on a nonlinear model for the pneumatic subsystem of the air brake system that correlates the pressure transients in the brake chamber with the supply pressure to the treadle valve and the displacement of the treadle <b>valve</b> <b>plunger.</b> These diagnostic schemes have been corroborated with data obtained from the experimental facility at Texas A&M University and the results are presented. The response of the pneumatic subsystem of the air brake system is such that it can be classified as what is known as a ??????Sequential Hybrid System??????. In this dissertation, the term ??????hybrid systems?????? is used to denote those systems whose mathematical representation involves a finite set of governing ordinary differential equations corresponding to a finite set of modes of operation. The problem of estimating the push rod stroke is posed as a parameter estimation problem and a transition detection problem involving the hybrid model of the pneumatic subsystem of the air brake system. Also, parameter estimation schemes for a class of sequential hybrid systems are developed. The efficacy of these schemes is illustrated with some examples...|$|E

5000|$|Anderson's career took off, however, in 1944, when {{he joined}} Duke Ellington's {{orchestra}} at the Earle Theater in Philadelphia. He quickly became {{a central part of}} Ellington's sound. Anderson was capable of playing in a number of jazz styles, but is best remembered as a high-note trumpeter. He had a big sound in all registers, but could play in the extreme high register (up to triple C) with great power (he was able to perform his high-note solos without a microphone, while other members of a big band were usually amplified for their solos). Wynton Marsalis called him [...] "one of the best" [...] high-note trumpeters. More than just a high-note trumpeter, though, Anderson was also a master of half <b>valve</b> and <b>plunger</b> mute playing. He played with Ellington's band from 1944 to 1947, from 1950 to 1959, and from 1961 to 1971, with each break corresponding to a failure to lead his own big band.|$|R

Although {{they have been}} widely used for decades, there are many issues regarding the fluid dynamics of the pump that have not been fully investigated. A project was conducted at Sandia National Laboratories to develop unimproved understanding of the fluid dynamics inside a sucker rod pump. A mathematical flow model was developed to predict pressures in any pump component or an entire pump under single-phase fluid and pumping conditions. Laboratory flow tests were conducted on instrumented individual pump components and on a complete pump to verify and refine the model. The mathematical model was then converted to a Visual Basic program to allow easy input of fluid, geometry and pump parameters and to generate output plots. Examples of issues affecting pump performance investigated with the model include the effects of viscosity, surface roughness, <b>valve</b> design details, <b>plunger</b> and <b>valve</b> pressure differentials, and pumping rate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Bicycle {{configuration}} is not {{as large}} as those of motorcycles or automobiles, while it indeed composes a complicated dynamic system. People’s requirements on comfortability, controllability and safety grow higher as {{the research and development}} technologies improve. The shock absorber affects the vehicle suspension performances enormously. The absorber takes the vibration energy and releases it at a suitable time, keeping the wheel under a proper contact condition with road surface, maintaining the vehicle chassis stability. Suspension design for mountain bicycles is more difficult than that of city bikes since it encounters dynamic variations on road and loading conditions. Riders need a stiff damper as they exert to tread on the pedals when climbing, while a soft damper when they descend downhill. Various switchable shock absorbers are proposed in markets, however riders have to manually switch them among soft, hard and lock positions. This study proposes a novel design of the bicycle shock absorber, which provides automatic smooth tuning of the damping coefficient, from a predetermined lower bound to theoretically unlimited. An automatic quick releasing valve is involved in this design so that it can release the peak pressure when the suspension fork runs into a square-wave type obstacle and prevent the chassis from damage, avoiding the rider skeleton from injury. This design achieves the automatic tuning process by innovative <b>plunger</b> <b>valve</b> and fluidic passage arrangements without any electronic devices. Theoretical modelling of the damper and spring are established in this study. Design parameters of the valves and fluidic passages are determined. Relations between design parameters and shock absorber performances are discussed in this paper. The analytical results give directions to the shock absorber manufacture...|$|R
