40|$|The {{contribution}} of <b>vacations</b> to people’s life satisfaction and Quality of Life (QOL) has recently attracted substantial attention among tourism researchers. Yet, most QOL scales {{do not include}} vacations: 7 % explicitly measure <b>vacations</b> whereas 42 % only include items relating to <b>vacations</b> within the broader Leisure domain. Leisure and <b>vacations,</b> however, differ substantially in nature with leisure referring to regular home-based activities and <b>vacations</b> being infrequent leisure activities away from home. As {{a consequence of the}} common amalgamation of <b>vacations</b> with leisure, there is limited knowledge about the specific {{contribution of}} <b>vacations</b> to people’s QOL. The present study (1) presents empirical evidence for the contribution of <b>vacations</b> to QOL, (2) determines the extent of this contribution, and (3) investigates variation in the extent to which <b>vacations</b> contribute to the QOL of different people. Results indicate that <b>vacations</b> contribute to the QOL of the majority of people, are as important a QOL domain as Leisure and People, and that QOL means different things to different people at different points in their life, representing an individual and dynamic concept...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the historical development of}} children's organized <b>vacationing,</b> focusing on <b>vacationing</b> {{of children from}} the Primorska region which had a special status between the two world wars.

There is a special mention of the importance of the pioneer organization and <b>vacationing</b> during the time of Fascism.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{cultural}} significance of family <b>vacations</b> {{and the role}} that these <b>vacations</b> play in {{the social construction of}} the family. Based on a series of semistructured interviews with members of families living in Ontario, Canada, the article examines the meanings and experiences associated with family <b>vacations</b> for parents of school aged children. Family <b>vacations</b> were seen as a form of escape from the pressures of everyday life, even though they involved organizational and emotional work, especially for mothers. Family <b>vacations</b> were valued as an opportunity for family togetherness and for improving patterns of family communication. Of particular importance was the long-term goal of creating memories that would enhance family cohesion and construct and support a positive sense of family. The findings indicate that the cultural meanings associated with family <b>vacations,</b> at least for these Canadian families, may be different in some important ways from other forms of tourism...|$|R
