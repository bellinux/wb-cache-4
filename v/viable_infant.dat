40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{publication}} of Swiss {{guidelines for the}} care of infants at the limit of viability (22 - 25 completed weeks) was followed by increased survival rates in the more mature infants (25 completed weeks). At the same time, considerable centre-to-centre (CTC) differences were noted. OBJECTIVES: To examine the trend of survival rates of borderline <b>viable</b> <b>infants</b> over a 10 -year-period and to further explore CTC differences. DESIGN: Population-based, retrospective cohort study. SETTING: All nine level III neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and affiliated paediatric hospitals in Switzerland. PATIENTS: 6532 preterm infants with a gestational age (GA) < 32 weeks born alive between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Trends of GA-specific delivery room and NICU mortality rates and survival rates to hospital discharge were assessed. For CTC comparisons, centre-specific risk-adjusted ORs for survival were calculated in three GA groups: A: 23 0 / 7 to 25 6 / 7 weeks (n= 976), B: 26 0 / 7 to 28 6 / 7 weeks (n= 1943) and C: 29 0 / 7 to 31 6 / 7 weeks (n= 3399). RESULTS: Survival rates of infants with a GA of 25 completed weeks which had improved from 42 % in 2000 / 2001 to 60 % in 2003 / 2004 remained unchanged at 63 % over the next 5 years (2005 - 2009). Statistically significant CTC differences have persisted and are not restricted to borderline <b>viable</b> <b>infants.</b> CONCLUSIONS: In Switzerland, survival rates of infants born at the limit of viability have remained unchanged over {{the second half of the}} current decade. Risk-adjusted CTC outcome variability cannot be explained by differences in baseline demographics or centre case loads...|$|R

40|$|A {{cohort of}} 6, 254 pregnancies {{surviving}} at least 20 weeks of gestation was identified through pregnancy testing and follow-up at three Kaiser Permanente medical offices in northern California in 1981 - 82.

40|$|Pregnancy may {{aggravate}} {{the natural}} history of an intracranial tumour, and may even unmask a previously unknown diagnosis. Here we present a series of seven patients who had brain tumours during pregnancy. The aim of this case series is to characterize the current perioperative management and to suggest evidence based guidelines for the anaesthetic management of pregnant females with brain tumours. This is a retrospective study. Information on pregnant patients diagnosed with brain tumours that underwent caesarean section (CS) and/or brain tumour resection from May 2003 through June 2008 was obtained from the Department of General Anaesthesia and the Rose Ella Burkhardt Brain Tumour & Neuro-Oncology Centre (BBTC) at the Cleveland Clinic, OH, USA. The mean age was 34. 5 years (range 29 - 40 years old). Six patients had glioma, two of whom had concomitant craniotomy and CS. Six cases had the tumour in the frontal lobe. Four cases were operated on under general anaesthesia and three underwent awake craniotomy. The neonatal outcomes of the six patients with elective or emergent delivery were six <b>viable</b> <b>infants</b> with normal Apgar scores. Pregnancy was terminated in the 7 th patient. In conclusion, good knowledge of the variable anesthetic agents and their effects on the fetus is very important in managing those patients...|$|R
40|$|Background: An {{accident}} or a catastrophic disease may occasionally lead to brain death (BD) during pregnancy. Management of brain-dead pregnant patients needs to follow special strategies {{to support the}} mother {{in a way that}} she can deliver a viable and healthy child and, whenever possible, also be an organ donor. This review discusses the management of brain-dead mothers and gives an overview of recommendations concerning the organ supporting therapy. Methods: To obtain information on brain-dead pregnant women, we performed a systematic review of Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). The collected data included the age of the mother, the cause of brain death, maternal medical complications, gestational age at BD, duration of extended life support, gestational age at delivery, indication of delivery, neonatal outcome, organ donation of the mothers and patient and graft outcome. Results: In our search of the literature, we found 30 cases reported between 1982 and 2010. A nontraumatic brain injury was the cause of BD in 26 of 30 mothers. The maternal mean age at the time of BD was 26. 5 years. The mean gestational age at the time of BD and the mean gestational age at delivery were 22 and 29. 5 weeks, respectively. Twelve <b>viable</b> <b>infants</b> were born and survived the neonatal period. Conclusion: The management of a brain-dead pregnant woman requires a multidisciplinary team which should follow available standards, guidelines and recommendations both for a nontraumatic therapy of the fetus and for an organ-preserving treatment of the potential donor...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess {{pregnancy}} outcomes of women treated with a novel neuraminidase inhibitor, laninamivir, during pregnancy. Methods A retrospective review of pregnancy outcomes of 112 pregnant women who were given laninamivir for treatment of influenza was performed. Possible adverse events, including miscarriages, preterm birth, foetal malformation and any neonatal morbidity requiring treatment, were assessed. Results Seventeen, 39, 46 and 10 women were administered a single inhaled dose of 20 or 40 mg of laninamivir at gestational week (GW) 3 - 11, 12 - 21, 22 - 36 and 37 or more, respectively. One (1. 8 %) of 56 women with laninamivir at GW < 22 experienced miscarriage at GW < 12. The remaining 111 women gave birth to 111 <b>viable</b> <b>infants</b> but at preterm (GW < 37) in nine (8. 8 %) of 102 women with laninamivir at GW < 37. Three (2. 7 %) of the 111 newborns had malformations: forefoot varus deformity, foot polydactyly and cleft lip in one each born to a mother taking laninamivir atGW 6, 17 and 21, respectively. Five neonates (4. 5 %) were small for gestational age. Eleven (9. 9 %), five (4. 5 %) and no neonates required phototherapy for jaundice, transient respiratory supports for respiratory distress syndrome (n = 2) or transient tachypnoea of the newborn (n = 3), and glucose administration for hypoglycaemia, respectively. Conclusions Although this study included a small number of study women and no control women, the results suggested that maternal exposure to laninamivir did not increase the rate of adverse pregnancy and foetal outcomes.

40|$|HYPOTHESIS: Emergency cesarean {{sections}} in trauma patients are not justified {{and should be}} abandoned. SETTING AND DESIGN: A multi-institutional, retrospective cohort study was conducted of level 1 trauma centers. METHODS: Trauma admissions from nine level 1 trauma centers from January 1986 through December 1994 were reviewed. Pregnant women who underwent emergency cesarean sections were identified. Demographic and clinical data were obtained on all patients undergoing a cesarean section. Fetal distress was defined by bradycardia, deceleration, or lack of fetal heart tones (FHTs). Maternal distress was defined by shock (systolic blood pressure < 90) or acute decompensation. Statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of the 114, 952 consecutive trauma admissions, more than 441 pregnant women required 32 emergency cesarean sections. All were performed for fetal distress, maternal distress, or both. Overall, 15 (45 %) of the fetuses and 23 (72 %) of the mothers survived. Of 33 fetuses delivered, 13 had no FHTs and none survived. Twenty infants (potential survivors) had FHTs and an estimated gestational age (EGA) of {{greater than or equal}} to 26 weeks, and 75 % survived. Infant survival was independent of maternal distress or maternal Injury Severity Score. The five infant deaths in the group of potential survivors resulted from delayed recognition of fetal distress, and 60 % of these deaths were in mothers with mild to moderate injuries (Injury Severity Score < 16). CONCLUSIONS: In pregnant trauma patients, infant viability is defined by the presence of FHTs, estimated gestational age {{greater than or equal to}} 26 weeks. In <b>viable</b> <b>infants,</b> survival after emergency cesarean section is acceptable (75 %). Infant survival is independent of maternal distress or Injury Severity Score. Sixty percent of infant deaths resulted from delay in recognition of fetal distress and cesarean section. These were potentially preventable. Given the definition of fetal viability, our initial hypothesis is invalid...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{report a}} case of a {{habitual}} aborter that had a pregnancy reach near term and successfully delivered a viable female infant. Design: Report of a unique case of a G 10 P 1 that was successfully able to maintain a pregnancy by maintaining serum levels of estradiol and progesterone at or above 200  pg/dL and 25  ng/dL respectively. This case provides a benchmark for exogenous support of estradiol and progesterone throughout pregnancy. Setting: A private advanced reproductive center. Patient: 39 -year-old G 10 P 1091 diagnosed to have antiphospholipid syndrome but continued to have continuous miscarriages despite accepted treatment. In addition, 8 products of conception were sent for cytogenetic testing and all were found to be normal.

40|$|This {{conference was}} {{prompted}} by the prosecution of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, who ran an abortion clinic in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Dr. Gosnell was convicted in May of 2013 of charges arising from the killing of <b>viable</b> <b>infants</b> born in his clinic, the negligent death of an adult patient, and the systematic disregard of regulations governing the performance of abortions in Pennsylvania. One question proposed for our consideration is whether Dr. Gosnell is an “outlier,” a description offered by the National Abortion Federation following Gosnell’s indictment. Presumably, one might {{want to know whether}} Gosnell was typical of abortion providers because it could shed light on contested questions concerning the justification for new abortion regulations. If Gosnell is uncharacteristic of abortion providers, one might argue, then his prosecution does not suggest the need for additional oversight. In this short essay, on the other hand, I argue that whether or not we can currently identify more providers like Gosnell, and there may well be some, his dangerous medical practice was a foreseeable consequence of the unsupervised market for abortion services in which he operated. Dr. Gosnell was able to routinely violate Pennsylvania law because Pennsylvania health officials decided access to abortion should be prioritized over monitoring compliance with regulations designed {{to ensure the safety of}} abortion procedures. Prioritizing access over safety is an ironic development in the history of abortion rights activism. A key argument for recognizing a constitutional right to abortion was that legalization would promote safety by ensuring that abortions were performed by licensed medical professionals subject to oversight by the state, a premise undermined by the laissez-faire practices of Pennsylvania officials. Any concern that oversight of abortion clinics might unnecessarily restrict access can be adequately addressed through the familiar principle of general applicability. There should be no question that states can properly enforce against abortion clinics regulations applied generally to other medical facilities presenting comparable risks to health...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the blood group antibody, anti-P, produced by p or Pk individuals may cause abortion early in pregnancy.

40|$|Secondary {{recurrent}} miscarriage (RM) {{is defined}} as three or more consecutive pregnancy losses after delivery of a <b>viable</b> <b>infant.</b> Previous reports suggest that a firstborn male child is associated with less favourable subsequent reproductive potential, possibly due to maternal immunisation against male-specific minor histocompatibility antigens. In a retrospective cohort study of 85 cases of secondary RM we aimed to determine if secondary RM was associated with (i) gender of previous child, maternal age, or duration of miscarriage history, and (ii) increased risk of pregnancy complications. Fifty-three women (62. 0 %; 53 / 85) {{gave birth to a}} male child prior to RM compared to 32 (38. 0 %; 32 / 85) who gave birth to a female child (p= 0. 002). The majority (91. 7 %; 78 / 85) had uncomplicated, term deliveries and normal birth weight neonates, with one quarter of the women previously delivered by Caesarean section. All had routine RM investigations and 19. 0 % (16 / 85) had an abnormal result. Fifty-seven women conceived again and 33. 3 % (19 / 57) miscarried, but {{there was no significant difference}} in failure rates between those with a previous male or female child (13 / 32 vs. 6 / 25, p= 0. 2). When patients with abnormal results were excluded, or when women with only one previous child were considered, there was still no difference in these rates. A previous male birth may be associated with an increased risk of secondary RM but numbers preclude concluding whether this increases recurrence risk. The suggested association with previous male birth provides a basis for further investigations at a molecular level...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background This report {{describes}} a patient counseling approach and non-surgical management of a dichorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancy where {{delivery of the}} second twin followed the delivery of the first by 110 days. Case presentation An early transvaginal sonogram at 19 1 / 2 weeks suggested cervical dilation with protruding amniotic membranes. Tocolytic and antibiotic therapy was initiated; no cerclage was placed. Spontaneous rupture of membranes and cord prolapse occurred 48 h later, resulting in delivery of a stillborn female infant. Conservative management was offered after counseling for possible risks associated with maternal sepsis, need for extended hospitalization, potential for hysterectomy and death. The cervix appeared closed after delivery and the umbilical cord was ligated, with subsequent spontaneous cord retraction in utero. Reassuring fetal status was observed for twin B without evidence of contractions or chorioamnionitis. A <b>viable</b> male <b>infant</b> (2894 g) was delivered vaginally at 35 1 / 2 weeks. Conclusions This report outlines a counseling approach useful for patients with premature delivery of one twin, and presents application of conservative obstetrical management principles for the aftercoming twin even when delivery interval is extreme. </p...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous rupture of the renal {{collecting}} {{system is a}} rare but serious complication of pregnancy. We report a case of nontraumatic left renal calyceal rupture in a pregnancy which ultimately progressed to preterm delivery. A 29 -year-old primigravida with a remote history of urolithiasis presented with left flank pain, suprapubic pain, and signs of preterm labor at 33 weeks of gestation. The patient was believed to have urolithiasis, although initial renal ultrasound failed to demonstrate definitive calculi. After a temporary improvement in flank pain with medication, the patient experienced acute worsening of her left flank pain. Urology was consulted and further imaging was obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was consistent with bilateral hydronephrosis and rupture of the left renal calyx. Given the patient’s worsening pain {{in the setting of}} left calyceal rupture, the urology team planned for placement of a left ureteral stent. However, before the patient could receive her stent, she progressed to active labor and delivered a <b>viable</b> female <b>infant</b> vaginally. Following delivery, the patient’s flank pain resolved rapidly and spontaneously, so no surgical intervention was performed. A summary of the literature and the details of this specific clinical situation are provided...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background We {{present a}} case of monochorionic-triamniotic {{pregnancy}} that developed after embryo transfer following in vitro fertilization (IVF). Methods After controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and transvaginal retrieval of 22 metaphase II oocytes, fertilization was accomplished with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Assisted embryo hatching was performed, and two embryos were transferred in utero. One non-transferred blastocyst was cryopreserved. Results Fourteen days post-transfer, serum hCG level was 423 mIU/ml and subsequent transvaginal ultrasound revealed a single intrauterine gestational sac with three separate amnion compartments. Three distinct foci of cardiac motion were detected and the diagnosis was revised to monochorionic-triamniotic triplet pregnancy. Antenatal management included cerclage placement at 19 weeks gestation and hospital admission at 28 weeks gestation due to mild preeclampsia. Three <b>viable</b> female <b>infants</b> were delivered via cesarean at 30 5 / 7 weeks gestation. Conclusions The incidence of triplet delivery in humans is approximately 1 : 6400, and such pregnancies are classified as high-risk for reasons described in this report. We also outline an obstetric management strategy designed to optimize outcomes. The roles of IVF, ICSI, assisted embryo hatching and associated laboratory culture conditions on the subsequent development of monozygotic/monochorionic pregnancy remain controversial. As demonstrated here, even when two-embryo transfer is employed after IVF the statistical probability of monozygotic multiple gestation cannot be reduced to zero. We encourage discussion of this possibility during informed consent for the advanced reproductive technologies. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Nestlé {{combined}} cow’s {{milk with}} grain and sugar {{to produce a}} substitute for breast milk. Moreover, he and his friend Jean Balthasar Schnetzler, a scientist in human nutrition, removed the acid and the starch in wheat flour because they were difficult for babies to digest. Initially called [...] "kindermehl" [...] (children flour), his product had an advantage over Liebig's [...] "soup for infants" [...] {{in that it was}} much easier to prepare, only needing to be boiled prior to feeding, and it soon proved to be a <b>viable</b> option for <b>infants</b> who were unable to breast feed. People quickly recognized the value of the new product and soon Farine Lactée Henri Nestlé (Henri Nestlé's Milk Flour in French) was being sold in much of Europe. By the 1870s, Nestlé's Infant Food, made with malt, cow's milk, sugar, and wheat flour, was selling in the US for $0.50 a bottle.|$|R
