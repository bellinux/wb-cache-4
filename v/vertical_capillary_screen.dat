40|$|Background: Lead has {{significant}} neuro-toxic effects, particularly for young children. Voluntary screening of pre-school aged children for elevated blood lead levels {{has been an}} important part of the lead management program in the mining town of Broken Hill (NSW, Australia) since 1991, where lead remains a significant public health issue for young children despite average blood lead levels having fallen by two-thirds. The annual proportion of children screened declined to 0. 39 in 2008. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of changing to <b>capillary</b> <b>screening</b> and linking screening with existing routine health programs on participation in blood lead screening by young children in the community. Methods: We used a before-after study. Screening rates were determined from routinely collected service data and analysed using cross-sectional and cohort analyses. Results: The proportion of children screened annually increased from 0. 39 in 2008 to 0. 75 in 2012, with the greatest increases among 11 - 23 and 48 - 59 month old children. The proportion of children screened at least once by 24 months increased from 0. 63 for children born in 2007 to 0. 98 for children born in 2010. Attendance stabilized after <b>capillary</b> <b>screening</b> was introduced, and increased markedly after screening was offered at immunization. Conclusions: Changing from venous to <b>capillary</b> <b>screening</b> stabilized attendance and improving convenience was associated with dramatically increased screening. Linking screening with well-accepted mainstream child health programs is an effective strategy to improve participation in blood lead screening programs.

Further, the accumulation of thermal energy within LAD channels can lead to the loss of sub-cooled propellant conditions and result in feed system cavitation during propellant outflow. Therefore, the fundamental question addressed by this program was: "To what degree is natural convection in a cryogenic liquid constrained by the <b>capillary</b> <b>screen</b> meshes envisioned for LADs. ?"Testing was first conducted with water as the test fluid, followed by LN 2 tests. In either case, the basic experimental approach was to heat the bottom of a cylindrical column of test fluid to establish stratification patterns measured by temperature sensors located above and below a horizontal screen barrier position. Experimentation was performed without barriers, with screens, and with a solid barrier. The two screen meshes tested were those typically used by LAD designers, " 200 x 1400 " and " 325 x 2300 ", both with Twill Dutch Weave.

40|$|The {{flow rate}} of powder {{in an open}} <b>vertical</b> <b>capillary</b> subject to {{transverse}} acoustic vibration is predicted using an explicit equation by considering the intermittent arrest and stasis of particles subject to acceleration in a field. The analysis rests solely on physical quantities that are easily measured by experiment. The calculation is supported by measured flow rate and by direct observation using high speed photography. Increasing the horizontal component of acceleration of a particle should not influence rate of descent but the overall time of flight is increased both by re-initiation of descent after collision at the wall and by fixed stationary periods on each cycle. Since flow stops when acoustic vibration stops, the vibrating tube is a valve that provides computer-controlled powder flow metering, mixing and dispensing. The valve is capable of adjusting the flow rate with a ratio of minimum to maximum flow rate of 0. 1.

40|$|Second {{generation}} solid freeforming devices {{will have}} the capability to render both shape and the spatial arrangement of composition directly from a computer file. In order to build three-dimensional functional gradients in selective laser sintering it is necessary to have a computer-controlled mixing and dispensing system. We report such a system based on the horizontal acoustic vibration of <b>vertical</b> <b>capillary</b> tubes that provides both switching and flow rate control. An orchestra of such tubes can be constructed to deposit a multi-component system onto a building platform. Our concern is the initiation of flow. It requires an “attack” waveform to break the domes that provide flow arrest and release the potential energy of powder above the dome. The intensity of attack also influences the mass that flows out before a new dome forms, i. e., the response time of the valve. Neither the extension to vibration caused by ringing nor the wave amplitude account for the over-run of the valve. Much better correlation is obtained with acceleration and with calculated kinetic energy of horizontally vibrating particles. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Episodic or {{intermittent}} flow, {{under constant}} influx conditions, {{has been observed}} under a number of scenarios in unsaturated flow systems. Flow systems characterized by a porous media underlain by a macropore, as well as discrete fracture networks, have been cited in recent literature as examples of systems that can exhibit episodic outflow behavior. Episodic outflow events are significant because relatively large volumes of water can move rapidly through an unsaturated system, carrying water and possibly contaminants to depth greatly ahead of a diffusive wetting front. In this study, we examine the modeled behavior of water flow through a sand column underlain by a <b>vertical</b> <b>capillary</b> tube {{in order to assess}} to potential for rapid vertical water movement, and compare the results to conventional modeling approaches and with experimental data from the literature.

It was also found that a good agreement between the theory and experiment could be found if the porous media was contained inside a glass tube so that inflow could only occur from below and not from the sides of the filter. In order to model the insertion of media without this tube, a combination of a horizontal and a <b>vertical</b> <b>capillary</b> model was needed.

Measurements were performed to investigate the dynamics of bubble coalescence under well-defined laboratory conditions. Air and pure aqueous solutions of alginate (no surfactants) were the phases. The bubbles were formed from two <b>vertical</b> <b>capillaries,</b> under constant flow conditions. The coalescence process was recorded with a fast video and then image analysed, to evaluate the bubble growth, bubble expansion rate, the first bubble touch, bubble contact time T, bubble coalescence efficiency E. Three control parameters were tested. The bubble size D on contact was set by the spacing between the capillaries (D= 1 and 1. 5 mm). The bubble approach velocity V was controlled by the gas input (V= 0. 031 - 39 mm/s). The liquid viscosity μ was adjusted by the alginate content (μ= 1. 2 - 10. 3 mPas). It was found that the bubble contact time T monotonously increases with the liquid viscosity, passing through three stages: initial rise (low μ, coalescence), then jump (intermediate μ, transient region), and finally forming a plateau (high μ, non-coalescence). In the coalescent regime, the bubble contact time monotonously decreases with the bubble approach velocity obeying a power law, which for a typical 1 mm bubble reads: T~V - 0. 85. The difference in the bubble size did not change the coalescence pattern qualitatively, but only quantitatively in a modest manner. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{particular}} {{configuration of}} a <b>vertical</b> <b>capillary</b> tube for which S is the equilibrium interface between two fluids {{in the presence}} of a downward pointing gravitational field was investigated. S is the graph a function u whose domain is the (horizontal) cross section gamma of the tube. The mean curvature of S is proportional to its height above a fixed reference plane and lambda is a prescribed constant and may be taken between zero and pi/ 2. Domains gamma for which us is a bounded function but does not extend continuously to d gamma are sought. Simple domains are found and the behavior of u in those domains is studied. An important comparison principle that has been used in the literature to derive many of the results in capillarity is reviewed. It allows one to deduce the approximate shape of a capillary surface by constructing comparison surfaces with mean curvature and contact angle close to those of the (unknown) solution surface. In the context of nonparametric problems the comparison principle leads to height estimates above and below for the function u. An example from the literature where these height estimates have been used successfully is described. The promised domains for which the bounded u does not extend continuously to the boundary are constructed. The point on the boundary at which u has a jump discontinuity will be the vertext of a re-entrant corner having any interior angle theta pi.

40|$|The {{application}} of <b>capillary</b> <b>screen</b> liquid acquisition devices to space-based cryogenic propulsion systems {{is expected to}} necessitate thermodynamic conditioning in order to stabilize surface tension retention characteristics. The present results have been obtained {{in the framework of}} the research of low gravity condensation-flow processes for conditioning cryogenic liquid acquisition devices. The following system is studied: On the top of a subcooled horizontal disk, a liquid film condenses from the ambient saturated vapor. The liquid is forcedly removed at the disk edge, and there is an outward radial flow of the film. Stationary regimes of the flow are uncovered such that (i) the gravity is negligible, being eclipsed by the capillary forces; (ii) the film thickness is everywhere much smaller than the disk radius; and (iii) the slow-flow lubrication approximation is valid. A nonlinear differential equation for the film thickness {{as a function of the}} radial coordinate is obtained. The (two-dimensional) fields of velocities, temperature and pressure in the film are explicitly determined by the radial profile of its thickness. The equilibrium is controlled by two parameters: (i) the vapor-disk difference of temperatures and (ii) the liquid exhaust rate. For the flow regimes with a nearly uniform film thickness, the governing equation linearizes, and the film interface is analytically predicted to have a concave-up quartic parabola profile. Thus, perhaps counter-intuitively, the liquid film is thicker at the edge and thinner at the center of the disk...|$|R

Controlled wetting-drying of these blocks, collected from a dam reservoir, mimics field ponding-desiccation conditions of the topsoil layer subject to caustic solar radiation, high temperature and wind, typical in the Batinah region of Oman. In 1 -D analytical modelling of a transient Richards’ equation for vertical evaporation, the {{method of small perturbations}} is applied, assuming that the relative permeability is Avery-anov’s 3. 5 -power function of the moisture content and capillary pressure is a given (measured) function. A linearized advective dispersion equation is solved with respect to the second term in the series expansion of the moisture content as a function of spatial coordinates and time. For a single block of a nite thickness we solve a boundary value problem with a no- ow condition at the bottom and a constant moisture content at the surface. Preliminary comparisons with theta-, TDR- probes measuring the moisture content and temperature at several in-block points are made.

A preset counterpressure was applied to the liquid meniscus when its temperature changed from a reference temperature (30 °C) to the temperature of interest. The magnitude of the counterpressure was adjusted such that the meniscus remained at the same height, thus compensating the change of the surface tension. One advantage of the counterpressure method over the height method consists of avoiding the uncertainty due to a possible variation of the capillary diameter along its length. A second advantage is that the equilibration time due to the capillary flow of the highly viscous supercooled water can be shortened. For both the counterpressure method and the height method, the actual results are relative values of surface tension with respect to the surface tension of water at the reference temperature. The combined relative standard uncertainty of the relative surface tensions is {{less than or equal to}} 0. 18 %. The new data between - 26 and + 30 °C lie close to the IAPWS correlation for the surface tension of ordinary water extrapolated below 0. 01 °C and do not exhibit any anomalous features...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{technique is}} described whereby {{a wide variety}} of interfacial phenomena is observed. The system investigated is the one component carbon tetrachloride liquid-vapor system. The principal part of the apparatus is a <b>vertical</b> <b>capillary</b> which opens squarely at the top into a liquid reservoir. A vapor phase is created in the capillary so that it supports the liquid phase above it. Movie photography techniques are used to document the interfacial behavior in the capillary and also document the nature of bubble formation and detachment at the capillary mouth. Studies on very rapidly moving interfaces reveal that deformation of a bubble can be caused by inertial forces acting on it from the liquid phase above. Bubble deformation also occurs when rapidly growing bubbles reattach to the previously detached rising bubble. Movies of the action inside the capillary reveals phase fragmentation occurs in the nature of alternating but short-lived slugs of liquid and vapor. Phase fragmentation also occurs when vapor phase growth begins at a vapor nucleate entrapped in the liquid phase of the capillary. Experimental methods are employed to retard the interfacial movement so that its motion is not readily perceivable to the naked eye. Movie documentation reveals that the retarded interface responds to inherent fluctuations of the system. Fluctuations of a much higher frequency are also noted. Experiments are conducted whereby the retarded interface is slowly disturbed by increasing the heat input to the heat bath around the capillary. Studies of bubble detachment reveals that the bubble undergoes a necking action at the capillary mouth prior to detachment. For slowly forming bubbles, the surface force holding the neck to the capillary mouth can be equated to the buoyancy force acting on the detaching bubble...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} both {{pressure}} and temperature {{on the specific}} volume of carbon tetrachloride was determined using a new experimental technique. An apparatus, called a capillary pycnometer, was constructed which enabled extension of existing data on liquid densities into the superheated region. In brief, the apparatus consisted of a spherical quartz bulb attached to a long uniform section of capillary tubing in such manner as to enable superheating of the liquid contained in the bulb. Specific volume data were obtained by noting changes in level of the liquid meniscus in the (<b>vertical)</b> <b>capillary</b> caused by changes in either pressure or temperature in the bulb. Data were taken along four isotherms (69. 83 °C, 76. 53 °C, 82. 23 °C, and 88. 03 °C) under conditions of increasing pressure (falling meniscus) as well as decreasing pressure (rising meniscus). No hysteresis in the results was obtained for pressures ranging from 418 mm Hg to 1104 mm Hg. The maximum superheat reported {{in this study is}} 13. 1 °C (obtained at 88. 03 °C and 718 mm Hg), although values as high as 42 °C were obtained during normal operation of the apparatus. Since the pycnometer system devised yielded only relative density values, it was necessary to obtain one absolute value to convert the other changes observed into absolute values. The data of Gibson and Loeffler were used for this purpose; in particular, a value of 1. 49558 grams per cubic centimeter at 69. 83 °C was chosen. Thus, the data reported here can be no more accurate, on an absolute basis, than that reported by Gibson and Loeffler; however, an error analysis reveals that the data obtained here, treated on a relative basis, is superior to any yet reported...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic wetting and {{absorption}} of water droplets on heterogeneous surfaces, including paper, was studied. The {{objective was to}} elucidate the role of surface heterogeneities on wetting and absorption properties of paper. To better understand the phenomena, wetting on glass slides with a controlled level of heterogeneity was investigated. Also, partially hydrophobized glass capillaries were used to simulate capillary penetration into the pores on sized paper. Dynamic wetting on paper followed a power law model with a lower rate than wetting on a smooth surface. The chemical composition of the paper surface {{did not affect the}} wetting dynamics, which was mainly affected by surface roughness in a micron scale. The super-hydrophobic properties of the sized papers were due to air entrapment in the micron-scale roughness on the surface. Wetting and {{absorption of}} water droplets on sized paper occurred in different time scales. A pseudo-equilibrium contact angle was reached at the end of wetting just before absorption of water droplets. Increasing the surface coverage of the hydrophobic domains on paper by sizing increased the pseudo-equilibrium contact angle and delayed absorption into paper. This delay was related to partial dissolution of the surface sizing polymers in the water droplets on the surface. The equilibrium contact angle of water droplets on partially hydrophobized glass slides was a linear function of a characteristic dimension of the hydrophobic domains and the length of the three phase contact line. The dynamic rise of water in partially hydrophobized <b>vertical</b> <b>capillaries</b> followed two mechanisms. First, capillary rise was a function of the dynamic contact angle, changing with the velocity of the contact line. Second, local changes of the advancing contact angle due to the heterogeneities on the capillary walls lowered the capillary rise velocity. The stick (pause) and jump of the contact line was another effect of the hydrophobic domains. Capillary rise dynamics was a function of the advancing contact angle of water droplets measured on a flat glass slide with the same coverage of hydrophobic domains...|$|R
40|$|Microfeeding of {{dry powder}} excited by {{ultrasonic}} vibration {{makes use of}} relatively simple equipment and {{can be applied to}} solid freeforming and pharmaceutical dosing. The nozzle was a <b>vertical</b> glass <b>capillary</b> and four configurations for ultrasonic actuation were investigated: Type I had a piezoelectric transducer ring bonded to the base of a cylindrical water-containing vessel containing an axial nozzle; Type II had a piezoelectric transducer ring attached to the sidewall of the vessel; Type III used direct mechanical connection to the glass wall of the capillary to give nominally longitudinal vibration; and Type IV also used direct connection to the glass tube but arranged to give progressive wave vibration. The experimental results show that all four configurations realized powder microfeeding and dosing but the characteristics, in terms of minimum flow rate, dependence on voltage amplitude and uniformity of dose varied considerably. The discharge of particles was observed by a high-speed camer...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD), gas-liquid mass transfer in upward Taylor flow through <b>vertical</b> circular <b>capillaries</b> was studied. To save computational resources and time, the numerical simulations were carried out in a moving frame of reference attached to Taylor bubbles. Three consecutive Taylor bubbles were used to mimic the behavior of Taylor flow in an infinitely long capillary. Steady-state solutions of concentration fields were obtained to describe gas transfer from Taylor bubbles to the liquid phase. The liquid-phase volumetric mass-transfer coefficient, K(L) a, was investigated {{as a function of}} various parameters, including the liquid-film length, liquid-slug length, liquid-film thickness, bubble rise velocity, liquid-phase diffusivity, capillary diameter, and gravity. One fitted equation, expressed with three dimensionless numbers, was developed to quantify the relationship between K(L) a and the above parameters. The examples show that the equation could predict K(L) a well. The contributions of the cylindrical bodies and hemispherical caps of Taylor bubbles on the overall mass transfer were studied separately...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} Phase 2 SBIR program was to develop and demonstrate a practically insoluble coating for nickel-based superalloys for Stirling engine heat pipe applications. Specific technical objectives of the program were: (1) Determine the solubility corrosion rates for Nickel 200, Inconel 718, and Udimet 72 OLI in a simulated Stirling engine heat pipe environment, (2) Develop coating processes and techniques for <b>capillary</b> groove and <b>screen</b> wick structures, (3) Evaluate the durability and solubility corrosion rates for <b>capillary</b> groove and <b>screen</b> wick structures coated with an insoluble coating in cylindrical heat pipes operating under Stirling engine conditions, and (4) Design and fabricate a coated full-scale, partial segment of the current Stirling engine heat pipe for the Stirling Space Power Convertor program. The work effort successfully demonstrated a two-step nickel aluminide coating process for groove wick structures and interior wall surfaces in contact with liquid metals; demonstrated a one-step nickel aluminide coating process for nickel screen wick structures; and developed and demonstrated a two-step aluminum-to-nickel aluminide coating process for nickel screen wick structures. In addition, the full-scale, partial segment was fabricated and the interior surfaces and wick structures were coated. The heat pipe was charged with sodium, processed, and scheduled to be life tested for up to ten years as a Phase 3 effort...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{experimentally}} {{investigate how}} the impregnation of porous media can be forced using the initial kinetic energy of an impacting drop. We {{focus on the}} scale of a single pore – either hydrophilic or hydrophobic– and thus study the impact of a single drop falling on <b>vertical</b> cylindrical <b>capillary</b> tubes. This experimental configuration therefore differs from the impregnation of a porous media because of the finite volume of the drop and its initial kinetic energy. We observe different limit regimes: at low impact velocity, we recover the classical results for impregnation. The liquid does not impregnate the hydrophobic pore while it is totally sucked into the hydrophilic one. At high impact velocities, the drop is broken in two parts: one part spreads {{at the top of the}} surface while an isolated slug is trapped within the pore. We determine the critical speeds for these regimes and obtain a full phase-diagram for our observations. We also stress the characteristics of impregnating slugs namely their volume and their motion within the pores...|$|R
40|$|The classic {{description}} of capillary rise {{given by the}} Washburn equation was recently questioned {{in the light of}} experimental evidence for a velocity dependent dynamic contact angle at a moving contact line. We present a systematic investigation of the capillary rise dynamics of glycerol and aqueous glycerol solutions in <b>vertical</b> glass <b>capillaries</b> of various radii. For pure glycerol, the results of our experiments are in almost perfect agreement with the predictions of the Washburn equation using independently measured values for the liquid and capillary parameters. For aqueous glycerol solutions we observe discrepancies between the theoretical expectations and the experimental results, which are increasing with the water content of the solution. A thorough analysis, combined with scaling arguments, allows us to conclude that dynamic contact angle effects alone cannot provide a consistent explanation for these discrepancies. Rather, they can be perfectly accounted for if the mixture flowing in the capillary would have an effective, increased viscosity (in respect to the nominal value). We suggest and briefly discuss various mechanisms that could contribute to this observed behavior. ...|$|R
