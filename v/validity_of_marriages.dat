50|$|Before 1842, doubts were {{expressed}} regarding the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> in New Zealand. Maori {{had their own}} marriage practices and immigrants to New Zealand from England, Scotland, Ireland, and other countries were of various Christian denominations, other religions, and non-believers. The immigrants brought with them a variety of marriage practices. Marriages were performed by officiating ministers of various denominations while other people simply declared themselves married. All marriages were considered common-law marriages under English common law but doubts arose because common law marriages were not recognised in England and Wales following the 1753 English Marriage Act, the first statutory legislation in England and Wales to require a formal ceremony of marriage.|$|E

50|$|Albrecht married Countess Maria (Marita) Franziska Juliana Johanna Draskovich de Trakostjan (1904-1969) on 3 September 1930 in Berchtesgaden. Daughter of Count Dionys Draskovich and Princess Juliana von Montenuovo (a {{great-granddaughter}} of Marie-Louise of Austria, sometime Empress of the French), {{she belonged}} to a family of the Croatian nobility known since 1230 and made Imperial counts in 1631. Although Albrecht's father allowed the wedding, a Wittelsbach family council concluded that the marriage was non-compliant with the dynasty's marital tradition {{as set out in}} its historical house laws, and the names of the couple's four children were excluded from the Almanach de Gotha. In 1948, however, a juridical consultation advised that the head of the house has sole authority to determine the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> within the House of Wittelsbach, prompting Crown Prince Rupprecht to recognize Albrecht's marriage as dynastic on 18 May 1949.|$|E
5000|$|The Hague Convention that harmonizes {{different}} marriage laws, the Convention on the Celebration and Recognition of the <b>Validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>Marriages,</b> {{was concluded}} at The Hague on 14 March 1978 and entered into force on 1 May 1991. Article 9 of the Convention holds that, “A marriage validly entered into {{under the law}} of the State of celebration or which subsequently becomes valid under that law shall be considered as such in all Contracting States, subject to the provisions of this Chapter.” In short, one Contracting State must recognize a marriage legally performed in another contracting state. Currently only three states (Australia, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) have ratified the Convention. [...] Another three (Egypt, Finland, and Portugal) have signed it. [...] One of the reasons that the Convention may have so few Contracting States is that states have long observed the principle of comity which has been defined in the United States as the “recognition that one nation allows within its territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation, having due regard both to the international duty and convenience and to the rights of its own citizens who are under the protection of its laws.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The Radical Party (Spanish: Partido Radical) of Chile was a Chilean {{political}} party. It {{was formed}} in 1863 in Copiapó by a split in the Liberal Party. Not coincidentally, it was formed shortly after {{the organization of the}} Grand Lodge of Chile, and it has maintained a close relationship with Chilean Freemasonry throughout its life. As such, it represented the anticlericalist position in Chilean politics, and was instrumental in producing the [...] "theological reforms" [...] in Chilean law in the early 1880s. These laws removed the cemeteries from the control of the Roman Catholic Church, established a civil registry of births and death in place of the previous recordkeeping of the church, and established a civil law of matrimony, which removed the determination of <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> from the church. Prior to these laws, it was impossible for non-Catholics to contract marriage in Chile, and meant that any children they produced were illegitimate. Non-Catholics had also been barred from burial in Catholic cemeteries, which were virtually the only cemeteries in the country; instead, non-Catholics were buried in the beaches, and even on the Santa Lucia Hill in Santiago, which, in the 19th century, functioned as Santiago's dump.|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the different ways}} that clandestine marriages were reproved {{in the writings of}} reformists and for what purposes. Medieval doctors had already demonstrated that a clandestine marriage was morally bad and canonically prohibited, even if they had had to recognize its validity to strengthen the consensualist theory of sacrament. In order to prove marriage was an honorable way to salvation for the laity, the theologian Jean Raulin argued that clandestine marriages were as devilish as adultery or fornication. Erasmus reproved the troubles that arose from the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> contracted without family consent or by having sex after betrothal. The two of them wanted to defend the marriage sacrament and reorder society. But Erasmus’s calling into question the sacramentality and indissolubility of clandestine marriages opened the way for Lutheran questioning of the scholastic theory of marriage: it is no sacrament but a civil contract, and parental approval is necessary to create it...|$|E
40|$|Transgendered {{individuals}} and their families face legal risks that most families do not, at least in part, because state laws are often unclear about whether or under what conditions transgendered individuals are permitted to marry the individuals whom they love. Challenges to the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> involving the transgendered may arise {{under a variety of}} circumstances, ranging from cases in which individuals may have hidden or may not even have known that they were transgendered until after their marriages, to cases in which the individuals had already transitioned and had explained their personal histories to their partners before they were married. Where such marriages are contested, a number of issues may have to be resolved including the validity of the marriage, parental status, and who should have custody of or visitation with any of the children raised by the parties. This Article focuses on the spousal and parent-child relationships of transgendered individuals. Regrettably, much of the law is still unclear. While most states specifyr the conditions under which a transgendered individual can have his or her birth certificate modified to reflect his or her self-identified sex, states have been much less clear about how local marriage laws apply to transgendered individuals. In many states, there is no express policy with respect to whether a transgendered person will only be permitted to marry someone of the opposite sex of his or her self-identified sex or, instead, someone of the opposite sex of his or her birth sex. Current law in most states is intolerable, either because it fails {{to take into account the}} actual lives of the transgendered, or because it is simply indeterminate...|$|E
