2500|$|Another leading {{officer who}} stayed loyal to Diệm was Colonel Cao Văn <b>Viên,</b> {{commander}} of the airborne brigade. <b>Viên</b> had been unaware of the plot, and the generals had discussed whether to assassinate him during their planning phase because they {{knew he was a}} Diệmist. However, Đính, who played mahjong with Viên's wife, convinced Minh to not have <b>Viên</b> liquidated, and promised that <b>Viên</b> would not oppose the coup. Đính's prediction that <b>Viên</b> would acquiesce was incorrect. <b>Viên</b> [...] "broke down completely" [...] and took off his insignia and handed it to Minh in resignation. He was then taken into custody, and sentenced to death. <b>Viên</b> had planned with Diệm to allow the president to take refuge at his home {{in the event of a}} coup, but the offer was moot as rebels surrounded Viên's house after taking him into custody. <b>Viên</b> narrowly avoided execution and was released and returned to command after the coup. General Khang, the {{commander of the}} marine brigade, was also put under arrest for remaining loyal to Diệm, as was the head of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force Đỗ Khắc Mai, and the national police chief.|$|R

The Olympia performance convinced a skeptical Paul Mauriat to work with Mireille, and songwriter André Pascal joined forces to develop her into a successful act. Together they wrote new modern material for her: Mon crédo, <b>Viens</b> dans ma rue, La première étoile and many other hit songs. Her first album En Direct de L'Olympia, on the Barclay label, was released in 1966. Highly acclaimed, along with the singles and EP's from it, the album made her a star outside France.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accumulation}} area ratio of a glacier, AAR, is {{the percentage of}} a glacier that is a snow-covered accumulation zone {{at the end of}} the summer melt season. [...] This percentage for large Alaskan glaciers is between 60 and 70 for non-calving glaciers, 70-80 for moderately calving glaciers and up to 90 for very high calving rate glaciers. By using {{accumulation area}} ratio (AAR) data for Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers, Pelto (1987) and <b>Viens</b> (1995) produced models showing that climate acts as a first-order control on the advance/retreat cycle of calving glaciers during most of the advance retreat cycle, but there are climate insensitive periods as well. [...] Pelto (1987) examined the terminus behavior of 90 Alaskan glaciers and found that the terminus behavior of all 90 were correctly predicted based on the AAR and calving rate.|$|E

50|$|General <b>Viên</b> {{met with}} Gen. Trần Văn Đôn, the new South Vietnamese Defense Minister, on April 16 and advised him that ARVN troops {{would no longer}} fight. To Australian Army Brigadier Ted Serong, this {{was a sign that}} Gen. <b>Viên</b> himself was abandoning the fight. But Maj. Gen. Homer D. Smith felt that <b>Viên</b> and the JGS staff were working very hard to {{reconstitute}} forces which had fled and wanted to continue to fight. On April 21, Gen. <b>Viên</b> issued a statement that said he would not resign and intended to stay and fight. On April 27, <b>Viên</b> helped brief members of the National Assembly on what was likely to happen once the city fell. Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ later said he called Gen. <b>Viên</b> on April 27 and offered to lead a tank column so that they could open the road to the west and help {{tens of thousands of people}} flee the city, but Gen. <b>Viên</b> dissuaded him. Viên's next actions are unclear. Some accounts say that Gen. <b>Viên</b> then resigned, telling President Trần Văn Hương that he could not serve under Gen. Dương Văn Minh (who had returned to the country in 1968 and would be named President on April 27). But other versions of the fall of Saigon have Gen. <b>Viên</b> leaving Vietnam on April 28 without resigning, leaving the JGS in turmoil.|$|R

Her song about the prayers of seamen (<b>Viens</b> à nous, Dieu tutélaire– [...] "Pray, O mighty God, calm with thy smile both sky and sea") and God's reply of [...] "let dangers be scorned" [...] ends with a rallying-cry (Courage!… du courage!) to the Sicilians to rebel against the occupiers. When the governor enters, the crowd calms down. Henri, just released from prison, assures Hélène how deeply he despises the governor. Overhearing this, Montfort orders Hélène to leave and then, alone with Henri, offers him a powerful position with his men {{as long as he}} stays away from Hélène.

Viên's political position remained unstable, however. Several times in 1969 and 1970, Prime Minister Trần Văn Hương advised Thiệu to replace <b>Vien</b> with Lt. Gen. Đỗ Cao Trí.|$|R
