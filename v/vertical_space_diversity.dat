Two combining techniques, maximal ratio combining (MRC) and selection combining(SC), are considered.

The obtained formula overcomes {{the limitations of}} the earlier work, which has been limited only to deriving the symbol error rate(SER) of QAMwith two branch MRC <b>space</b> <b>diversity.</b> The formula for SC <b>space</b> <b>diversity</b> is obtained by averaging the symbol error probability of M-ary QAM in an AWGN channel over the distribution of the maximum signal-to-noise ratio among all of the diversity channels for SC <b>space</b> <b>diversity.</b> No analysis for QAM with SC <b>space</b> <b>diversity</b> has been reported yet.

40|$|Meta-heuristics {{have already}} been used {{extensively}} for the successful solution {{of a wide range}} of real world problems. A few industrial engineering examples include inventory optimization, production scheduling, and vehicle routing, all areas which have a significant impact on the economic success of society. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to predict which meta-heuristic from the multitude of algorithms available, will be best to address a specific problem. Furthermore, many algorithm development options exist with regards to operator selection and parameter setting. Within this context, the idea of working towards a higher level of automation in algorithm design was born. Hyper-heuristics promote the design of more generally applicable search methodologies and tend to focus on performing relatively well on a large set of different types of problems. This thesis develops a heterogeneous meta-hyper-heuristic algorithm (HMHH) for single-objective unconstrained continuous optimization problems. The algorithm development process focused on investigating the use of meta-heuristics as low level heuristics in a hyper-heuristic context. This strategy is in stark contrast to the problem-specific low level heuristics traditionally employed in a hyper-heuristic framework. Alternative low level meta-heuristics, entity-to-algorithm allocation strategies, and strategies for incorporating local search into the HMHH algorithm were evaluated to obtain an algorithm which performs well against both its constituent low level meta-heuristics and four state- of-the-art multi-method algorithms. Finally, the impact of diversity management on the HMHH algorithm was investigated. Hyper-heuristics lend themselves to two types of diversity management, namely solution <b>space</b> <b>diversity</b> (SSD) management and heuristic <b>space</b> <b>diversity</b> (HSD) management. The concept of heuristic <b>space</b> <b>diversity</b> was introduced and a quantitative metric was defined to measure heuristic <b>space</b> <b>diversity.</b> An empirical evaluation of various solution <b>space</b> <b>diversity</b> and heuristic <b>space</b> <b>diversity</b> intervention mechanisms showed that the systematic control of heuristic <b>space</b> <b>diversity</b> has a significant impact on hyper-heuristic performance.

In contrast to conventional subcarrier-based <b>space</b> <b>diversity,</b> it is shown that the proposed technique can be implemented using only one discrete Fourier transform block and the same weighting coefficients for the whole OFDM symbol.

A radar rain reflectivity data base obtained {{during the summer}} of 1973 is injected into a modeling program and the attenuation along parallel earth-satellite paths are obtained for a conglomeration of azimuths. Statistics are separated into two groupings: one pertaining to earth-satellite paths oriented in the northwest-southeast and the other in the northeast-southwest quadrants using a fixed elevation angle of 45 deg. The latter case shows fading to be greater with a degraded <b>space</b> <b>diversity</b> suggesting rain cells to be elongated along this direction. Cell dimensions are analyzed for both sets of quadrants and are found to have average values larger by 2 km in the northeast-southwest quadrants; a result consistent with the fade and <b>space</b> <b>diversity</b> results.

40|$|Abstract — In {{wireless}} communication systems, signal <b>space</b> <b>diversity</b> techniques are usually adopted to combat channel fading by exploiting time diversity, frequency diversity, spatial diversity {{or a combination}} of them. Most existing schemes to achieve signal <b>space</b> <b>diversity</b> are based on linear constellation spreading. In this paper, we propose a novel nonlinear signal <b>space</b> <b>diversity</b> technique based on maximum distance separable (MDS) codes. The new technique provides a design flexibility for almost any number of diversity channels and desired diversity orders. We also propose a simple and suboptimal diversity channel selection (DCS) decoding for our new scheme. DCS decoding can greatly reduce the decoding complexity at a cost of marginal performance loss relative to the optimal detection while keeping the diversity order. Simulation results show that with the same throughput but a lower decoding and implementation complexity, our scheme can have superior performance than the optimal linear spreading schemes over either independent fading or additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels.

An important design goal is to maximize the level of <b>space</b> <b>diversity</b> that a code can achieve.

To design codes with higher bandwidth efficiency, we develop an algebraic rank theory to ensure full <b>space</b> <b>diversity</b> for PP quadrature and amplitude modulated (QAM) codes for any positive integer. The theory provides the most general sufficient condition of full <b>space</b> <b>diversity</b> so far. It includes the BPSK binary rank theory as a special case.
