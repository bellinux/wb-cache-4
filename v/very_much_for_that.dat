60|$|The {{case was}} to come up early in July, and I {{spent most of my}} time, to the {{detriment}} of other affairs, in preparing for it. I was greatly hampered in my work by my client, who filled my office with his tobacco-smoke and that of his friends, and he took it <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> granted <b>that</b> he was going to win the suit. Fortune had always played into his hands, he said, and I had no little difficulty in convincing him that matters had passed from his hands into mine. In this I believe I was never entirely successful. I soon found, too, that he had no ideas whatever on the value of discretion, and it was only by repeated threats of absolute failure that I prevented our secret tactics from becoming the property of his sporting fraternity and of the town.|$|R

60|$|With {{a war in}} prospect, and {{belonging}} to a regiment that had an unusual number of officers detailed on special duty away from the regiment, my hopes of being ordered to West Point as instructor vanished. At the time of which I now write, officers in the quartermaster's, commissary's and adjutant--general's departments were appointed from {{the line of the}} army, and did not vacate their regimental commissions until their regimental and staff commissions were for the same grades. Generally lieutenants were appointed to captaincies to fill vacancies in the staff corps. If they should reach a captaincy in the line before they arrived at a majority in the staff, they would elect which commission they would retain. In the 4th infantry, in 1844, at least six line officers were on duty in the staff, and therefore permanently detached from the regiment. Under these circumstances I gave up everything like a special course of reading, and only read thereafter for my own amusement, and not <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> until the war was over. I kept a horse and rode, and staid out of doors most of the time by day, and entirely recovered from the cough which I had carried from West Point, and from all indications of consumption. I have often thought that my life was saved, and my health restored, by exercise and exposure, enforced by an administrative act, and a war, both of which I disapproved.|$|E
6000|$|For {{a moment}} Mr. Tom did not speak. Then, {{determined}} {{to go through with}} what he had come to do, which was to make himself acquainted with this girl, he said: [...] "I do not wish to discuss anything that is painful to you, but Mrs. Easterfield and I are <b>very</b> <b>much</b> disturbed <b>for</b> fear <b>that</b> in some way your visit to Broadstone created some misunderstanding or disagreeable feeling between you and your uncle.

"I doubt <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{if some of}} {{them know}} how to drive a nail, for the matter of that," [...] said Courtland, still good-humoredly, [...] "but that's the fault of a system older than themselves, which {{the founders of the}} Republic retained.

This is definitely {{one of the most beautiful}} states in the Union. I’m also delighted to have this opportunity to talk to this group in particular. You are all very aware that our country has gone through a difficult financial crisis and that we are still only beginning to make our way back from its impact. There have been many changes in financial regulation designed to reduce the risk of a recurrence of such a traumatic event. My goal today is to describe changes in the U. S. tax code that I believe will make such a crisis less likely to occur. And before going further, let me note that these remarks reflect my views, not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System or on the Federal Open Market Committee. My starting point is the Dodd-Frank Act. It’s less than a year old, having been passed in July of 2010. But, even in that short time, it already seems clear that it is the single most important piece of legislation related to the U. S. financial system to be passed in at leas...|$|E

25|$|The Pelagornithidae had {{extremely}} thin-walled bones widely pneumatized {{with the}} air sac extensions of the lungs. Most limb bone fossils are <b>very</b> <b>much</b> crushed <b>for</b> <b>that</b> reason. In life, the thin bones and extensive pneumatization enabled the birds to achieve large size while remaining below critical wing loadings. Though 25kg/m2 (5lb/ft2) {{is regarded as the}} maximum wing loading for powered bird flight, there is evidence that bony-toothed birds used dynamic soaring flight almost exclusively: the proximal end of the humerus had an elongated diagonal shape that could hardly have allowed for the movement necessary for the typical flapping flight of birds; their weight thus cannot be easily estimated. The attachment positions for the muscles responsible for holding the upper arm straightly outstretched were particularly well-developed, and altogether the anatomy seems to allow for an ability of holding the wings rigidly at the glenoid joint unmatched by any other known bird. This is especially prominent in the Neogene pelagornithids, and less developed in the older Paleogene forms. The sternum had the deep and short shape typical of dynamic soarers, and bony outgrowths at the keel's forward margin securely anchored the furcula.|$|R

25|$|Bass player John Arliss {{initially}} took Andes' place. California {{was still}} in the line-up, but he had suffered a head injury from a horse riding accident and was unable to tour. Bass player Al Staehely was recruited by Locke and Cassidy, and they toured briefly before deciding that they had to add a guitar player to do the music justice. Al's brother, John Christian (Chris) Staehely, auditioned for the band and was quickly brought on board, departing the Texas rock group Krackerjack. The Staehelys, Cassidy and Locke recorded the 1972 album Feedback in Columbia/Epic's Hollywood studios. It was a different turn for the group, showing more of a country rock influence pervading their jazzier tendencies, but it only met with a mild commercial response, also reaching No.63 in the charts. The tour for Feedback proceeded <b>very</b> well <b>for</b> <b>much</b> of <b>that</b> year, but with musical roots that went different directions, eventually both Cassidy and Locke left the lineup. The Staehely brothers recruited Stu Perry to play drums. While the tour was well received critically, Spirit disbanded in mid-1973. The brothers would release their own album, Sta-Hay-Lee, in 1973.|$|R

This was communicated to her by Mrs. Lyddell, and she could not {{discover}} from whence he wrote; she supposed from London, unless he was still detained in Devonshire. She looked forward greatly to his coming, as there was so much to hear about Gerald; and she felt, as if she wanted something pleasant, <b>very</b> <b>much</b> indeed; <b>for,</b> now <b>that</b> Lionel was gone, she found what a companion, interest, and occupation he had been, and missed him <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> The constraint with all the others, except Clara, was wearisome: and Clara, though never ceasing to talk, and very affectionately, was anything but a companion, while poor Caroline kept more than ever aloof, and had a flightiness of spirits--a sort of gaiety of manner--which, to Marian, seemed to be assumed. This was more especially the case, after there was an idea of fixing the marriage for some time in the autumn, and arrangements were talked over. Marian began to have little doubt that she was secretly unhappy, and grew more and more tender in feeling towards her; while, by an effect of contraries, her manner became more frigid and severe, in proportion to the warmth within.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to explore how medical care is {{delivered}} to older people in assisted living (AL) settings and to suggest ways for improving it. Design and Methods: We present a review of the limited research available on health care for older AL residents and on building testable models of better ways to organize primary health care and other health services for AL residents. Results: AL resi-dents are frequently frail older persons who need good chronic care. The predominant care models today do not respond adequately to this challenge. Medical care for AL residents is currently practiced <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like <b>that</b> <b>for</b> persons living in the com-munity. The potential for using the aggregation of patients has not been effectively tapped. We review some managed care models from other elements of long-term care to look <b>for</b> ways <b>that</b> might be adapted. However, the current funding approach emphasizes living settings rather than inherent client characteristics. Implications: A research agenda might include ways to improve communication be-tween AL and medical providers and to get AL staff more actively involved in daily care. Research sup-port might produce the data necessary to entice the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services into changing its current reimbursement policies to create a climate better suited to delivering good chronic disease care in AL facilities...|$|R
40|$|Langmuir monolayers {{consist of}} {{amphiphilic}} molecules at the air-water interface {{and can be}} modeled as two-dimensional fluids. Earlier experiments [D. J. Olson, G. G. Fuller, J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 89 (2000) 187 - 207] on 4 : 1 contraction and 4 : 1 expansion flows have been simulated using an integral constitutive equation of the K-BKZ type, suitably modified to account for strain-thickening in the planar extensional viscosity. The model {{has been used to}} fit linear viscoelastic data (G' and G '') and the shear viscosity (eta(S)), while the amount of strain-hardening is assumed, due to lack of experimental data. The simulations are in good agreement with the experiments on Newtonian monolayers. which show no vortices in the contraction but large inertial vortices in the expansion. For the viscoelastic monolayer (a poly-octadecyl methacrylate or PODMA), the opposite is true. The contraction flow shows vortices, while in the expansion flow the Vortex activity is substantially reduced compared with the Newtonian one. The viscoelastic behavior is well captured by the model, provided that Substantial strain-thickening is exhibited by the monolayer in planar extension. The latter behavior is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a branched LDPE melt, which also shows big vortices due to strain-hardening in planar as well as in uniaxial extension.

6000|$|The other {{qualification}} {{necessary for}} all pastors, {{if they will}} not be [...] "blind, ignorant, greedy, drunken dogs," [...] &c., is, [...] "to know the depths of Satan." [...] This is harder than the former; that a poor gentleman ought not to be parson, vicar, or curate of a parish, except he be cunninger than the devil. I am afraid {{it will be difficult to}} remedy this defect for one manifest reason, because whoever had only half the cunning of the devil, would never take up with a vicarage of £10 a-year, [...] "to live on at his ease," [...] as my Lord expresseth it; but seek out for some better livelihood. His Lordship is of a nation <b>very</b> <b>much</b> distinguished <b>for</b> <b>that</b> quality of cunning (though they have a great many better) and I think he was never accused for wanting his share. However upon a trial of skill I would venture to lay six to four on the devil's side, who must be allowed to be at least the older practitioner. Telling truth shames him, and resistance makes him fly: But to attempt outwitting him, is to fight him at his own weapon, and consequently no cunning at all. Another thing I would observe is, that a man may be [...] "in the depths of Satan," [...] without knowing them all, and such a man may be so far in Satan's depths as to be out of his own. One of the depths of Satan, is to counterfeit an angel of light. Another, I believe, is, to stir up the people against their governors, by false suggestions of danger. A third is to be a prompter to false brethren, and to send wolves about in sheep's clothing. Sometimes he sends Jesuits about England in the habit and cant of fanatics, at other times he has fanatic missionaries in the habits of ----. I shall mention but one more of Satan's depths, for I confess I know not the hundredth part of them; and that is, to employ his emissaries in crying out against remote imaginary dangers, by which we may be taken off from defending ourselves against those which are real and just at our elbows.|$|R
