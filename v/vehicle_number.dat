40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This study {{investigated}} the effects of different response strategies, vehicle location strategies and <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers</b> on response times in a simulated Emergency Medical Services system. The simulation was a computer model using discrete-event simulation and the model was based on Western Cape Emergency Medical Services operations in Cape Town. The study objectives were to (i) create the simulation model, (ii) determine the best-performing combination of explanatory factors and (iii) {{determine the effect of}} increasing <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers</b> on response time performance. The simulation model took into account incident arrival rates, incident and hospital spatial distributions, <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers</b> and dispatch practices in the modelled system. Verification and validation of the simulation model utilised a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. The validated simulation model was changed in two ways: (i) the response strategy was changed to either single or two-tier (the response model factor) and (ii) the vehicle location strategy was changed to either dynamic or static (the vehicle location factor). This yielded four individual models each representing one combination of these factors. Each simulation model was run for a simulated period of seven days. Output data were analysed using multivariate analysis of variance in order to identify differences in response time between the factor combinations. A single-tier model using dynamic vehicle locations produced the best response performance. This model was run repeatedly, increasing <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers</b> incrementally with each run to assess the effect of increased <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers</b> on response time performance. A doubling of <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers</b> resulted in an 14 % {{increase in the number of}} responses meeting the national performance target for high acuity incidents, while a seven-fold increase in <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers</b> increased this to 15 %. No further performance increases were seen beyond this with increased <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers.</b> A 2 % performance increase for lower acuity incidents was seen with the same increase in <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers.</b> In the system modelled, increasing <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers</b> should not be expected to realise anything more than small improvements in response time performance, at a high operational cost. Fine-grained dynamic deployment of vehicles in anticipation of system demand appears to be a more important determinant of response performance than <b>vehicle</b> <b>numbers</b> alone...|$|R

25|$|The six {{traditional}} counties {{remain in}} use for some purposes, including the three-letter coding of <b>vehicle</b> <b>number</b> plates, the Royal Mail Postcode Address File (which records counties in all addresses {{although they are}} no longer required for postcoded mail) and Lord Lieutenancies (for which the former county boroughs are also used). There are no longer official 'county towns'. However the counties are still very widely acknowledged, for example as administrative divisions for sporting and cultural organisations.|$|E
25|$|In September 2011, the UK Rail Safety and Standards Board issued Railway Group Standard GM/RT2453 (issue two), {{which made}} some {{alterations}} to the TOPS classes allocated to {{various types of}} locomotive and multiple unit. This extended the number ranges for certain types of locomotive or multiple unit where there was otherwise a danger of available class numbers running out.

25|$|The current {{standard}} for Malaysian number plates were originally derivatives of pre-1932 number plate formats in the United Kingdom, first issued after {{the introduction of}} motorised vehicles in the 1900s during British rule. Number plates are typically issued and are formatted similarly for any motorised vehicle that runs on rubber tyres, including most road-legal private, commercial and industrial vehicles, motorcycles, emergency vehicles, and selected heavy equipment (such as agricultural tractors, truck-mounted cranes and backhoe loaders). With the exception of those issued for taxis, vehicle dealers and diplomats, all <b>vehicle</b> <b>number</b> plates in Malaysia have white characters on black background for both front and rear plates, regardless of the vehicle type.|$|E

2500|$|From 1951–2, Australian {{automobiles}} were {{to adopt}} a broad scheme across all states and territories for <b>vehicle</b> <b>number</b> plates. Both NSW and Victoria had previously issued plates with 2-letters, 3-digits, white on a black background. However, while implemented, this was not entirely popular as some states and territories preferred their own identity reflected on their vehicles instead.

2500|$|If {{a vehicle}} was {{initially}} allocated a twelve digit number {{according to the}} old UIC regulations, and using the second digit as a balancing number (which, however, was only {{to be found in}} directories), then a TSI compliant number was assigned to the vehicle from 2008.

2500|$|As {{the first}} new {{locomotive}} series following {{the development of the}} first draft revised system, the Re 450 series was classified partially in accordance with that draft; what would have been the locomotive numbers under the old system (10500ff) were replaced by sequential numbers (000 ff), and the number of axles was still prepended to the <b>vehicle</b> <b>number</b> in the old fractional form (Re 4/4 450000 ff). [...] Upon the delivery of the first Re 460 locomotives in 1991, [...] a corresponding classification style was used.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, the Swiss Federal Railways {{introduced}} a new classification and numbering system, which combined the old series classification, build type number and <b>vehicle</b> <b>number,</b> but was used at its inception only for new vehicles (the first one being the Re 450). [...] The standard gauge private railways of Switzerland soon followed {{the example of the}} Swiss Federal Railways, and agreement was reached as to the allocation of number ranges. [...] The narrow gauge railways have largely retained the old system for locomotives, railcars and passenger carriages, but there have been some minor individual additions to the old system.|$|E

2500|$|In 1992, {{the first}} draft revised system was itself {{comprehensively}} revised into a Draft '92. [...] Under the latter draft, the indication of the numbers of a vehicle's axles in fractional form was abandoned, but the designation of the traction type was retained. [...] The old <b>vehicle</b> <b>number</b> system was completely replaced with new sequential numbers beginning with 000. [...] The new numbering {{was supposed to take}} into account all vehicles that, as at 1988, were still in service with the Swiss Federal Railways. [...] But that principle was inadvertently ruled out, and therefore not followed, in the assignment of new numbers.|$|E
2500|$|A Eurosceptic, Bennett was {{a member}} of The Drive the Flag {{campaign}} founded by Leeds businessman Peter Rogers, to allow national flags on <b>vehicle</b> <b>number</b> plates, in the face of proposed government legislation which would have only allowed the European Union (EU) symbol on the number plates. In December 2001, the Government announced that it planned to permit the display of the Union flag as well as the national flags of England, Scotland and Wales vehicle numberplates in the UK. This was implemented on 27 April 2009 with the caveat that drivers who chose {{to take advantage of this}} dispensation need to display a [...] "GB sticker" [...] on their vehicles when driving abroad.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, it {{was decided}} to {{standardise}} on a colour which became known as Rail Blue. Introduced in 1965, and also known as [...] "Monastral Blue", the colour was defined by British Standards BR28/6001 (Airless spray finish) and BR28/5321 (Brush finish). [...] It was a dark, greyish blue tone which hid the effects of dirt well. The colour often appears inaccurately in photographs, generally appearing brighter and bluer than the real colour. In the early years the colour faded quite badly, becoming lighter and paler with time although this problem had been overcome by the late 1970s. United Kingdom paint code RAL5020 ("Ocean Blue") is a good match to Rail Blue. There is also a British Standard paint colour BS381C 114 called Rail Blue which was introduced in 1964. The new British Rail [...] "double arrow" [...] symbol on locomotives (or leading vehicle as was the case on multiple unit stock) and the <b>vehicle</b> <b>number</b> and other ancillary markings written in the Rail Alphabet typeface were other integral parts of the livery.|$|E
