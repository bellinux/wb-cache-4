30|$|In Forslund et al. (2011) it is {{investigated}} how {{the relative}} effect of work practice and <b>vocational</b> class-room <b>training</b> {{is affected by}} the aggregate unemployment rate. The study uses Swedish data from 1999 to 2005, and like Lechner & Wunch (2009 >) they use a matching estimator that enables control for both the composition of unemployed and activation types. They find a negative locking-in effect and positive programme effects for both types of activation and that both effects are larger for the <b>vocational</b> class-room <b>training.</b> This implies that in the short run work practice is more effective, whereas <b>vocational</b> class-room <b>training</b> is more effective in the longer run. When the effects are correlated with the unemployment rate the article finds that the relative effectiveness of <b>vocational</b> class-room <b>training</b> increases in the unemployment rate. Like in Lechner & Wunch (2009) this is related to a decreasing locking-in effect when unemployment increases.|$|R

D 	The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} <b>vocational</b> skills <b>training</b> on the on-task participation and comments made by individuals with dual diagnoses during treatment sessions. The study began with a Vocational Skills/Cleaning group (treatment phase) in which researchers tracked on-task and off-task comments made by group members during the first and last ten minutes of <b>vocational</b> skills <b>training.</b> For the remaining time, participants were presented with a cleaning activity and the degree of participation in the identified activity was recorded. Next, the researcher measured the on-task and off-task comments made during the Typical Group/Psycho Social Rehab (PSR) phase involving the usual group discussions that were the common habilitative approach at the facility. Results showed that both on-task comments and on-task participation increased and were maintained above the normative levels during <b>vocational</b> skills <b>training.</b> The study also assessed two specific target behaviors for one group member who engaged in elopement and door slamming at high rates during typical group sessions. Both elopement and door slamming decreased during the treatment phase of the intervention providing additional support for the use of <b>vocational</b> skills <b>training</b> in congregate settings for adults with dual diagnoses...|$|R
