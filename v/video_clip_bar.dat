40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a system that}} takes audio signals of any song sung by a singer as the input and automatically generates a music <b>video</b> <b>clip</b> in which the singer appears to be actually singing the song. Although music <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> have gained the popularity in video streaming services, not all existing songs have corresponding <b>video</b> <b>clips.</b> Given a song sung by a singer, our system generates a singing <b>video</b> <b>clip</b> by reusing existing singing <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> featur-ing the singer. More specifically, the system retrieves short fragments of singing <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> that include singing voices {{similar to that in}} target song, and then concatenates these fragments using a technique of dynamic program-ming (DP). To achieve this, we propose a method to extract singing scenes from music <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> by combining vo-cal activity detection (VAD) with mouth aperture detection (MAD).

This paper proposes a content-based retrieval strategy of sports <b>video</b> <b>clip</b> in which visual and auditory features and text information are extracted to locate similar <b>video</b> <b>clips.</b> Because in sports game play scenes are concerned and interested for most audiences, a long sport video is first automatically segmented into play segments and time-out segments based on audio feature in compressed domain. And then we obtain similar <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> based on sliding shot window algorithm and equivalence relation theory. Finally similar <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> are ranked by visual factor and order factor in terms of longest common sequence (LCS). The experimental results showed that the proposed method could effectively and efficiently retrieve similar <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> corresponding with a query clip in a sports video of TV program...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: E-learning has {{acquired}} a prime place in many discussions recently. A number of research efforts {{around the world are}} trying to enhance education and training through improving e-learning facilities. This paper briefly explains one such attempt aimed at designing a system to support <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> in e-learning and explains how profiles of the presenters in <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> can be used to improve the usefulness of e-learning systems. The system proposed is capable of storing educational <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> with their semantics and retrieving required <b>video</b> <b>clip</b> segments efficiently on their semantics. The system creates profiles of presenters appearing in the <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> based on their facial features and uses these profiles to partition similar <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> into logical meaningful segments. The paper also discusses one of the main problems identified in profile construction and presents a novel algorithm to solve this problem...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Video</b> <b>clip</b> {{retrieval}} plays {{a critical}} role in the content-based video retrieval. Two major concerns in this issue are: (1) automatic segmentation and retrieval of similar <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> from <b>video</b> database; (2) similarity ranking of similar <b>video</b> <b>clips.</b> In this paper, motivated by the maximal matching and optimal matching in graph theory, a novel approach is proposed for <b>video</b> <b>clip</b> retrieval based on matching theory. To tackle the clip segmentation and retrieval, the retrieval process is divided into two phases: shot-based retrieval and clip-based retrieval. In shot-based retrieval, a shot is temporally partitioned into several sub-shots based on motion content. The similarity among shots is measured according to the color content of sub-shots. In clip-based retrieval, candidates of similar <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> are selected by modeling the continuity of similar shots. Maximal matching based on Hungarian algorithm is then adopted to obtain the final similar <b>video</b> <b>clips.</b> To rank the similarity of the selected <b>video</b> <b>clips,</b> four different factors: visual similarity, granularity, interference and temporal order of shots are taken into consideration. These factors are modeled by optimal matching based on Kuhn-Munkres algorithm and dynamic programming. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is effective and efficient in retrieving and ranking similar <b>video</b> <b>clips...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recently, <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> {{have become}} very popular online. Massive influx of <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> has created an urgent need for video search engines to {{facilitate}} retrieving relevant clips. Different from traditional long <b>videos,</b> a <b>video</b> <b>clip</b> is a short video often expressing a moment of significance. Due to high complexity of video data, efficient <b>video</b> <b>clip</b> search from large databases {{turns out to be}} very challenging. We propose a novel <b>video</b> <b>clip</b> representation model called Bounded Coordinate System (BCS), which is the first single representative capturing the dominating content and content changing trends of a <b>video</b> <b>clip.</b> It summarizes a <b>video</b> <b>clip</b> by a coordinate system, where each of its coordinate axes is identified by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and bounded by the range of data projections along the axis. The similarity measure of BCS considers the operations of translation, rotation and scaling for coordinate system matching. Particularly, rotation and scaling reflect the difference of content tendencies. Compared with the quadratic time complexity of existing methods, the time complexity of measuring BCS similarity is linear. The compact video representation together with its linear similarity measure makes real-time search from <b>video</b> <b>clip</b> collections feasible. To further improve the retrieval efficiency for large video databases, a two-dimensional transformation method called Bi-Distance Transformation (BDT) is introduce...|$|R

We manipulated the original <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> as follows: either we reduced {{the speed of}} a real-time <b>video</b> <b>clip</b> four times or we increased {{the speed of a}} slow-motion <b>video</b> <b>clip</b> four times. The <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> were cut down to the essential fragment {{to be able to come}} to a correct decision. This resulted in two identical <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> for each situation, 60 <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> in real time (mean duration 3.08  s) and the same 60 <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> in slow motion (mean duration 12.32  s). The same information was present in both video speed conditions, only the temporal dynamics were modulated. The <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> are MP 4 files (720 × 406 pixels), with good quality and with the background sound removed. Two independent and experienced ex-international referees, still involved as referee match observers for UEFA, determined the reference decisions based on the rules established by Law 12 : Foul and Misconduct (FIFA, 2016). Both modes (real time and slow motion) were available to determine the reference decisions. These two referees were able to view the clips multiple times and they knew the decisions that had been made by the original referees during the game. As an expert panel, both referees made independent evaluations first and then discussed the <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> with the UEFA chief refereeing officer to resolve any disagreement. They reached the following consensus decisions (reference decisions): 4 = no foul; 2 = foul with no card; 36 = foul with yellow card; and 18 = foul with red card.|$|R

Music usually has a more limited role in movies, used in certain scenes throughout the movie to evoke or enhance particular emotions. On the contrary, in music <b>videos</b> <b>clips,</b> emotions are much more dependent on the characteristics of the audio and video than on the plot or the semantics of the speech.
