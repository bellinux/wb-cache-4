5|$|While the {{aerospace}} industry {{is one of the}} primary users of gas tungsten arc welding, the process is used {{in a number of other}} areas. Many industries use GTAW for welding thin workpieces, especially nonferrous metals. It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles, and is also frequently employed to weld small-diameter, thin-wall tubing such as those used in the bicycle industry. In addition, GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass welds for piping of various sizes. In maintenance and repair work, the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies, especially components made of aluminum and magnesium. Because the weld metal is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most open arc welding processes, a vast assortment of welding filler metal is available to the welding engineer. In fact, no other welding process permits the welding of so many alloys in so many product configurations. Filler metal alloys, such as elemental aluminum and chromium, can be lost through the electric arc from <b>volatilization.</b> This loss does not occur with the GTAW process. Because the resulting welds have the same chemical integrity as the original base metal or match the base metals more closely, GTAW welds are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods, making GTAW the welding procedure of choice for critical operations like sealing spent nuclear fuel canisters before burial.|$|E
25|$|Many of the fission {{products}} volatilized {{are the same}} ones volatilized in non-fluorinated, higher-temperature <b>volatilization,</b> such as iodine, tellurium and molybdenum; notable differences are that technetium is volatilized, but caesium is not.|$|E
25|$|Chlorides {{remaining}} after <b>volatilization</b> {{may also}} be separated by solubility in water. Chlorides of alkaline elements like americium, curium, lanthanides, strontium, caesium are more soluble than those of uranium, neptunium, plutonium, and zirconium.|$|E
25|$|<b>Volatilization</b> of PCBs in {{soil was}} thought to be the primary source of PCBs in the atmosphere, but {{research}} suggests ventilation of PCB-contaminated indoor air from buildings is the primary source of PCB contamination in the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Post-depositional {{decomposition}} and ammonia <b>volatilization</b> of penguin guano {{also plays}} an important role in the evolution of ornithogenic sediments in the cold and arid environment of Antarctica (McMurdo Sound of the Ross Sea region, East Antarctica).|$|E
25|$|Nitrogen is {{released}} into the air because of ammonia <b>volatilization</b> and nitrous oxide production. The combustion of fossil fuels is a large human-initiated contributor to atmospheric nitrogen pollution. Atmospheric deposition (e.g., {{in the form of}} acid rain) can also affect nutrient concentration in water, especially in highly industrialized regions.|$|E
25|$|Pickleweed {{is used in}} Phytoextraction, it {{is highly}} {{effective}} at removing selenium from soil, which is absorbed by the plant and then released into the atmosphere to be dispersed by prevailing winds. Pickleweed (Salicornia bigelovii) {{has been found to}} have average <b>volatilization</b> rates 10-100 times higher than other species.|$|E
25|$|Urea {{is usually}} spread at rates of between 40 and 300kg/ha but rates vary. Smaller {{applications}} incur lower losses due to leaching. During summer, urea is often spread just before or during rain to minimize losses from <b>volatilization</b> (a process wherein nitrogen is {{lost to the}} atmosphere as ammonia gas).|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{decomposition}} of concrete produces water vapor and carbon dioxide, which may further react with the metals in the melt, oxidizing the metals, {{and reducing the}} gases to hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The {{decomposition of}} the concrete and <b>volatilization</b> of its alkali components is an endothermic process. Aerosols released during this phase are primarily based on concrete-originating silicon compounds; otherwise volatile elements, for example, caesium, can be bound in nonvolatile insoluble silicates.|$|E
25|$|Sidestream tobacco smoke, or exhaled {{mainstream}} smoke, {{is particularly}} harmful. Because exhaled smoke exists at lower temperatures than inhaled smoke, chemical compounds undergo changes {{which can cause}} them to become more dangerous. As well, smoke undergoes changes as it ages, which causes {{the transformation of the}} compound NO into the more toxic NO2. Further, <b>volatilization</b> causes smoke particles to become smaller, and thus more easily embedded deep into the lung of anyone who later breathes the air.|$|E
25|$|Fire {{may cause}} changes in soil {{nutrients}} {{through a variety}} of mechanisms, including oxidation, <b>volatilization,</b> erosion, and leaching by water. Temperatures must be very high, however, to cause a significant loss of nutrients, which are often replaced by organic matter left behind in the fire. Also, the minerals which were formerly part of slowly decaying plant matter become more soluble and available in the ash. Charcoal is able to counteract some nutrient and water loss because of its absorptive properties.|$|E
25|$|Some samples {{contained}} {{a small amount}} of metallic melt (less than 0.5%), composed of silver and indium (from the control rods). A secondary phase composed of chromium(III) oxide was found in one of the samples. Some metallic inclusions contained silver but not indium, suggesting a sufficiently high temperature to cause <b>volatilization</b> of both cadmium and indium. Almost all metallic components, with the exception of silver, were fully oxidized; however even silver was oxidized in some regions. The inclusion of iron and chromium rich regions probably originate from a molten nozzle that did not have enough time to be distributed through the melt.|$|E
25|$|The {{mass was}} found to be homogeneous, {{primarily}} composed of molten fuel and cladding. The elemental constitution was about 70wt.% uranium, 13.75wt.% zirconium, 13wt.% oxygen, with the balance being stainless steel and Inconel incorporated into the melt; the loose debris showed somewhat lower content of uranium (about 65wt.%) and higher content of structural metals. The decay heat of corium at 224 minutes after scram was estimated to be 0.13W/g, falling to 0.096W/g at scram+600 minutes. Noble gases, caesium and iodine were absent, signifying their <b>volatilization</b> from the hot material. The samples were fully oxidized, signifying the presence of sufficient amounts of steam to oxidize all available zirconium.|$|E
25|$|DDT is a {{persistent}} organic pollutant that is readily adsorbed to soils and sediments, which can act both as sinks and as long-term sources of exposure affecting organisms. Depending on conditions, its soil half-life can range from 22 days to 30 years. Routes of loss and degradation include runoff, <b>volatilization,</b> photolysis and aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation. Due to hydrophobic properties, in aquatic ecosystems DDT and its metabolites are absorbed by aquatic organisms and adsorbed on suspended particles, leaving little DDT dissolved in the water. Its breakdown products and metabolites, DDE and DDD, are also persistent and have similar chemical and physical properties. DDT and its breakdown products are transported from warmer areas to the Arctic by the phenomenon of global distillation, where they then accumulate in the region's food web.|$|E
25|$|Several {{reactions}} {{occur between}} {{the concrete and}} the corium melt. Free and chemically bound water is released from the concrete as steam. Calcium carbonate is decomposed, producing carbon dioxide and calcium oxide. Water and carbon dioxide penetrate the corium mass, exothermically oxidizing the non-oxidized metals present in the corium and producing gaseous hydrogen and carbon monoxide; large amounts of hydrogen can be produced. The calcium oxide, silica, and silicates melt and are mixed into the corium. The oxide phase, in which the nonvolatile fission products are concentrated, can stabilize at temperatures of 1300–1500°C for a considerable period of time. An eventually present layer of more dense molten metal, containing fewer radioisotopes (Ru, Tc, Pd, etc., initially composed of molten zircaloy, iron, chromium, nickel, manganese, silver, and other construction materials and metallic fission products and tellurium bound as zirconium telluride) than the oxide layer (which concentrates Sr, Ba, La, Sb, Sn, Nb, Mo, etc. and is initially composed primarily of zirconium dioxide and uranium dioxide, possibly with iron oxide and boron oxides), can form an interface between the oxides and the concrete farther below, slowing down the corium penetration and solidifying within a few hours. The oxide layer produces heat primarily by decay heat, while the principal heat source in the metal layer is exothermic reaction with the water released from the concrete. Decomposition of concrete and <b>volatilization</b> of the alkali metal compounds consumes {{a substantial amount of}} heat.|$|E
500|$|The {{chemistry}} of zinc {{is dominated by}} the +2 oxidation state. When compounds in this oxidation state are formed, the outer shell s electrons are lost, yielding a bare zinc ion with the electronic configuration 3d10. In aqueous solution an octahedral complex, [...] is the predominant species. The <b>volatilization</b> of zinc in combination with zinc chloride at temperatures above 285°C indicates the formation of , a zinc compound with a +1 oxidation state. No compounds of zinc in oxidation states other than +1 or +2 are known. Calculations indicate that a zinc compound with the oxidation state of +4 is unlikely to exist.|$|E
500|$|The astatine-containing {{cyclotron}} {{target is}} heated to {{a temperature of}} around 650°C. The astatine volatilizes and is condensed in (typically) a cold trap. Higher temperatures of up to around 850°C may increase the yield, {{at the risk of}} bismuth contamination from concurrent <b>volatilization.</b> Redistilling the condensate may be required to minimize the presence of bismuth (as bismuth can interfere with astatine labeling reactions). The astatine is recovered from the trap using one or more low concentration solvents such as sodium hydroxide, methanol or chloroform. Astatine yields of up to around 80% may be achieved. Dry separation is the method most commonly used to produce a chemically useful form of astatine.At via the 209Bi (α,2n)211At reaction | journal=Applied Radiation and Isotopes|volume=47 |issue=2|pages=135–143 |doi=10.1016/0969-8043(95)00285-5|subscription=yes}} ...|$|E
500|$|On a {{molecular}} scale, {{there are two}} main competing reaction processes involved in the degradation of cellulose, or wood fuels, in wildfires. [...] When there is a low amount of moisture in a cellulose fiber, <b>volatilization</b> of the fuel occurs; this process will generate intermediate gaseous products that will ultimately be the source of combustion. [...] When moisture is present—or when enough heat is being carried away from the fiber, charring occurs. The chemical kinetics of both reactions indicate that there is a point at which the level of moisture is low enough—and/or heating rates high enough—for combustion processes become self-sufficient. Consequently, changes in wind speed, direction, moisture, temperature, or lapse rate at different levels of the atmosphere can {{have a significant impact on}} the behavior and growth of a wildfire. Since the wildfire acts as a heat source to the atmospheric flow, the wildfire can modify local advection patterns, introducing a feedback loop between the fire and the atmosphere.|$|E
2500|$|This {{design of}} {{incinerator}} has 2 chambers: a primary chamber and secondary chamber. [...] The primary chamber in a rotary kiln incinerator {{consists of an}} inclined refractory lined cylindrical tube. The inner refractory lining serves as sacrificial layer to protect the kiln structure. This refractory layer needs to be replaced from time to time. Movement of the cylinder on its axis facilitates movement of waste. In the primary chamber, there is conversion of solid fraction to gases, through <b>volatilization,</b> destructive distillation and partial combustion reactions. The secondary chamber is necessary to complete gas phase combustion reactions.|$|E
2500|$|Monsanto has {{requested}} {{approval for a}} stacked strain that is tolerant of both glyphosate and dicamba. The request includes plans for avoiding herbicide drift to other crops. Significant damage to other non-resistant crops occurred from dicamba formulations intended to reduce <b>volatilization</b> drifting when sprayed on resistant soybeans in 2017. The newer dicamba formulation labels specify to not spray when average wind speeds are above [...] to avoid particle drift, average wind speeds below [...] to avoid temperature inversions, and rain or high temperatures are {{in the next day}} forecast. However, these conditions typically only occur during June and July for a few hours at a time.|$|E
2500|$|As noted above, {{treating}} metals-containing sediments with HCl liberates metal ions {{into the}} acid solution {{that were previously}} bound up with AVS. After treatment these are present in solution, along with any metals that were initially unbound to AVS (due to insufficient AVS in the sediment to [...] "mop up" [...] all the metal ions). The concentrations of metals in the acid solution can be measured {{by a number of}} analytical chemistry methods, including atomic emission spectrometry, atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), or mass spectrometry. These are known as [...] "simultaneously extracted metals" [...] because they are the metals liberated from the sediment while the <b>volatilization</b> of sulfide is occurring. Metals extracted from sediment by digestion, or with a different acid than HCl are not simultaneously extracted metals. By correcting appropriately for dilution, the SEM concentration in the sediment can be determined.|$|E
2500|$|The British Geological Survey {{reported}} {{the amount and}} distribution of PAH compounds including parent and alkylated forms in urban soils at 76 locations in Greater London, UK. The study showed that parent (16 PAH) content ranged from 4 to 67mg/kg (dry wt soil) and an average PAH concentration of 18mg/kg (dry wt soil) whereas the total PAH content (33 PAH) ranged from 6 to 88mg/kg and fluoranthene and pyrene were generally the most abundant PAH. Benzopyrene (BaP) the most toxic of the parent PAH is widely considered a key marker PAH for environmental assessments; the [...] normal background concentration of BaP in the London urban sites was 6.9mg/kg (dry wt soils). London soils contained more stable 4-6 ring PAH which were indicative of combustion/pyrolytic sources such as coal/oil burning and traffic sourced particulates. However, the overall distribution also suggested that the PAHs in London soils had undergone weathering and been modified {{by a variety of}} pre-and post-depositional processes such as <b>volatilization</b> and microbial biodegradation.|$|E
6000|$|... 614. The {{power or}} force which makes {{combustible}} gas or vapour abandon its elastic state {{in contact with}} a solid, that it may cover the latter with a thin stratum of its own proper substance, is considered as being neither attraction nor affinity. It is able also to extend liquids and solids in concrete laminæ {{over the surface of}} the acting solid body, and consists in a repulsion, which is developed from the parts of the solid body by the simple fact of attenuation, and is highest when the attenuation is most complete. The force has a progressive development, and acts most powerfully, or at first, in the direction in which the dimensions of the attenuated mass decrease, and then {{in the direction of the}} angles or corners which from any cause may exist on the surface. This force not only causes spontaneous diffusion of gases and other substances over the surface, but is considered as very elementary in its nature, and competent to account for all the phenomena of capillarity, chemical affinity, attraction of aggregation, rarefaction, ebullition, <b>volatilization,</b> explosion, and other thermometric effects, as well as inflammation, detonation, &c. &c. It is considered as a form of heat to which the term native calorie is given, and is still further viewed as the principle of the two electricities and the two magnetisms.|$|E
60|$|Now, compare a plant, thus contemplated, with an animal. In the former, the {{productive}} energy exhausts itself, {{and as it}} were, sleeps in the product or 'organismus'--in its root, stem, foliage, blossoms, seed. Its balsams, gums, resins, 'aromata', and all other bases of its sensible qualities, are, it is well known, mere excretions from the vegetable, eliminated, as lifeless, from the actual plant. The qualities are not its properties, but the properties, or far rather, the dispersion and <b>volatilization</b> of these extruded and rejected bases. But in the animal it is otherwise. Here the antecedent unity--{{the productive}} and self-realizing idea--strives, with partial success to re-emancipate itself from its product, and seeks once again to become 'idea': vainly indeed: for in order to this, it must be retrogressive, and it hath subjected itself to the fates, the evolvers of the endless thread--to the stern necessity of progression. 'Idea' itself it cannot become, but it may in long and graduated process, become an image, an ANALOGON, an anti-type of IDEA. And this [Greek: eidolon] may approximate to a perfect likeness. 'Quod est simile, nequit esse idem'. Thus, in the lower animals, we see this process of emancipation commence with the intermediate link, or that which forms the transition from properties to faculties, namely, with sensation. Then the faculties of sense, locomotion, construction, as, for instance, webs, hives, nests, &c. Then the functions; as of instinct, memory, fancy, instinctive intelligence, or understanding, as it exists in the most intelligent animals. Thus the idea (henceforward no more idea, but irrecoverable by its own fatal act) commences the process of its own transmutation, as 'substans in substantiato', as the 'enteleche', or the 'vis formatrix', and it finishes the process as 'substans e substantiato', that is, as the understanding.|$|E
50|$|Ammonia <b>volatilization</b> {{reduces the}} {{economic}} efficiency of agricultural cropping systems. Either yield {{will be reduced}} or additional costs will be incurred from additional nitrogen fertilizer. The amount of ammonia <b>volatilization</b> depends on several environmental factors, including temperature, pH, and the soil water content. Additionally, the amount of surface residue and time between urea application and precipitation are also critical. Generally speaking, <b>volatilization</b> will be lower when urea is applied during the wetter and cooler conditions that generally occur in early spring (March and April). However, drying surface soil and rising temperatures as spring progresses increases the probability of ammonia <b>volatilization.</b> Ideally, a manager should attempt to apply nitrogen immediately before a moderate rain event (0.1 inch), allowing urea to dissolve and move into the soil. However, {{this is not always}} possible. The soil’s pH also has a strong effect on the amount of <b>volatilization.</b> Specifically, highly alkaline soils (pH~8.2 or higher) have proven to increase urea hydrolysis. One study has shown complete hydrolysis of urea within two days of application on such soils. In acidic soils (pH 5.2) the urea took twice as long to hydrolyze. Surface residues, such as thatch and plant stubble exhibit increased urease activity. Soils that have high organic matter content also tend to have higher urease concentrations. More urease results in greater hydrolysis of urea and ammonia <b>volatilization,</b> particularly if urea fails to move into the soil.|$|E
