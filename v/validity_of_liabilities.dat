40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} <b>validity</b> and <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> a Swedish {{translation}} of the Post Hospitalization Behavior Questionnaire (PHBQ) in children in Sweden. METHODS: The PHBQ was translated using a back-translation method. The subjects were 340 children, ages 2 - 13 y, admitted for elective surgery or diagnostic procedure with anaesthesia. The results were analysed using exploratory factor analysis with principal component analysis with Oblimin rotation. The fit to data was examined using confirmative factor analysis with a good measure of fit for the model (p> 0. 09 for all factors). RESULTS: Five factors emerged as being most consistent: general anxiety-withdrawal, eating disturbances, separation anxiety, regression-aggression and sleep anxiety. A panel of child psychologists confirmed the face <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> factors. Internal consistency (Chronbach's alpha) was adequate (0. 75 - 0. 87) for subscales and excellent for total score (0. 93). Children less than 5 y old had higher scores than older children (mean 0. 046 +/- 0. 018 vs - 0. 0089 +/- 0. 014, p< 0. 001). There were no gender differences. CONCLUSION: The results support a conclusion that a five-factor model better fits data from Swedish children than the original six-factor model...|$|R

40|$|Pigovian {{taxation}} of externalities {{has limited}} appeal if the tortfeaser has insufficient resources {{to pay the}} damage when it occurs. To defend Pigovian taxation {{in the presence of}} judgement-proof agents, its proponents point at the many institutions extending liability to third parties. Yet {{little is known about the}} <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> Pigou's analysis in this context. The paper analyses the costs and benefits <b>of</b> extended <b>liability</b> and investigates whether full internalization is called for in the presence of agency costs between potential tortfeasers and providers of guarantees. Its contribution is two-fold. It first shows that the better the firms' corporate governance and the stronger their balance sheet, the more closely taxes should track the corresponding externality. It then develops the first analysis <b>of</b> extended <b>liability</b> when guarantors themselves may be judgement-proof, and the extension <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> may give rise to further externalities. Relatedly, it derives the curvature of the optimal taxation of externalities in a multi-plant firm. Copyright © 2009 The Review of Economic Studies Limited. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{self-administration}} {{model is}} the primary non-clinical approach for assessing the reinforcing properties of novel compounds. Given the now frequent use of rats in self-administration studies, {{it is important to}} understand the predictive <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the rat self-administration model for use in abuse liability assessments. This review of 71 drugs identifies high concordance between findings from rat self-administration studies and two clinical indicators <b>of</b> abuse <b>liability,</b> namely reports <b>of</b> positive subjective-effects and the DEA drug scheduling status. To understand the influence of species on concordance we compare rodent and non-human primate (NHP) self-administration data. In the few instances where discrepancies are observed between rat data and the clinical indicators <b>of</b> abuse <b>liability,</b> rat self-administration data corresponds with NHP data in the majority of these cases. We discuss the influence of genetic factors (sex and strain), food deprivation state and the study design (acquisition or drug substitution) on self-administration study outcomes and highlight opportunities to improve the predictive <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the self-administration model...|$|R

40|$|Florida law is {{currently}} unclear {{on the issue}} of whether a professional may rely upon a limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clause in a professional services contract. Limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses are common in business contracts, especially in construction, a field that includes many professionals such as engineers and architects. While Florida has historically enforced limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses in professional services contracts, recent cases have cast doubt on whether the clauses are enforceable. If the Florida Supreme Court establishes that professionals cannot rely upon these clauses, it will be taking a position contrary to the majority of states, including New York, California, and Texas, all of which enforce limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses with varying degrees of restriction. This Note argues that Florida should not prohibit professionals from using limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses. These clauses do not violate public policy when, as already required by Florida law, the clauses are stated clearly, ensuring that both parties to the contract are aware of their existence. Permitting professionals to continue to rely upon limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses honors the contracting parties’ freedom of contract. Additionally, limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses provide an efficient method for parties to allocate risk...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how {{the absence of}} insurance in the past led to some special maritime liability law principles such as 'general average' (i. e., losses or expenses shared by all the parties to a maritime adventure) and the limitation <b>of</b> shipowners' <b>liability.</b> In the absence of insurance, these principles served the function of insurance mostly for shipowners. As commercial marine insurance is now widely available, these principles have lost their justification and may in fact interfere with the most important goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law i. e., deterrence from negligence. The thesis thus recommends their abolition. The thesis further argues that when insurance is easily available and affordable to the both parties to a liability claim, the main goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law should be deterrence as opposed to compensation. This is exactly {{the case with the}} maritime cargo liability claims where both cargo owners and shipowners are invariably insured. As a result, the sole focus <b>of</b> cargo <b>liability</b> law should be and, to a great extent, is deterrence. On the other hand, in the vessel-source oil pollution liability setting, pollution victims are not usually insured. Therefore, oil pollution liability law has to cater both for compensation and deterrence, the two traditional goals <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law. The final question the thesis addresses is whether the deterrent effect <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law is affected by the availability <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance. Contrary the popular belief the thesis attempts to prove that the presence <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance is not necessarily a hindrance but can be a complementary force towards the realization of deterrent goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law...|$|R

The canonical Shavell model predicts that, {{despite the presence of}} some ex ante moral hazard (care-reduction by insureds), liability insurance will generally raise welfare because its risk-spreading gains will likely be larger than its adverse effects on precautionary activities. We discuss the numerous features <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance contracts that are designed to reduce ex ante moral hazard, and examine the evidence of their effects. Most studies conclude that these features work reasonably well, so that liability insurance probably does not generate substantial ex ante moral hazard. Its effects on ex post moral hazard (the increased tendency of victims to sue in the presence of insurance) are not as clear, however, and the welfare consequences of increased litigation are ambiguous, for reasons we explain.
