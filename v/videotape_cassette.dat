50|$|S-VHS video {{cassette}} recorders (VCRs) and cassette tapes are nearly identical in appearance and operation, and backward compatible with VHS. Older VHS VCRs cannot play back S-VHS recordings at all, but can record onto an S-VHS tape {{in the basic}} VHS format. Newer VHS VCRs, depending upon their specification, offered a feature called S-VHS quasi-playback or Super Quasi-Play Back, abbreviated to SQPB. SQPB lets basic VHS players view (but not record) S-VHS recordings, though reduced to the lesser VHS quality. This feature is useful for viewing S-VHS camcorder recordings which used either the full-size S-VHS <b>videotape</b> <b>cassette</b> or the smaller S-VHS-C <b>videotape</b> <b>cassette.</b>|$|E
5000|$|One {{other major}} {{consequence}} of the Betamax technology's introduction to the U.S. was the lawsuit Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios (1984, the [...] "Betamax case"), with the U.S. Supreme Court determining home videotaping to be legal in the United States, wherein home <b>videotape</b> <b>cassette</b> recorders were a legal technology since they had substantial noninfringing uses. This precedent was later invoked in MGM v. Grokster (2005), where the high court agreed that the same [...] "substantial noninfringing uses" [...] standard applies to authors and vendors of peer-to-peer file sharing software (notably excepting those who [...] "actively induce" [...] copyright infringement through [...] "purposeful, culpable expression and conduct").|$|E
5000|$|In February 1983, {{the band}} {{released}} the album Uspavanka za Radmilu M. (Lullaby for Radmila M.). Bregović intended to release Uspavanka za Radmilu M. as Bijelo Dugme's farewell album and {{to dismiss the}} band after the tour. The album was recorded in Skopje and featured Vlatko Stefanovski (guitar), Blagoje Morotov (double bass) and Arsen Ereš (saxophone) as guest musicians. The songs [...] "Ako možeš zaboravi" [...] ("Forget, if You Can"), [...] "U vrijeme otkazanih letova" [...] ("In the Time of Canceled Flights"), [...] "Polubauk polukruži poluevropom" [...] ("Half-Spectre is Half-Haunting Half-Europe", the title referring to the first sentence of The Communist Manifesto) and [...] "Ovaj ples dame biraju" [...] ("Ladies' Choice") featured diverse sound, illustrating various fazes in the band's career. The album's title track is the only instrumental track Bijelo Dugme ever recorded. Unlike the band's previous album, Uspavanka za Radmilu M. was not followed by a large promotion in the media. The release of the album {{was followed by the}} release of the <b>videotape</b> <b>cassette</b> Uspavanka za Radmilu M., which featured videos for all the songs from the album. It was the first project of the kind in the history of Yugoslav rock music. The videos were directed by Boris Miljković and Branimir Dimitrijević [...] "Tucko". The video for the song [...] "Ovaj ples dame biraju" [...] was the first gay-themed video in Yugoslavia.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the design, validation, {{and implementation of}} the education material The world of malaria: let´s learn to handle it in the community. Methods: The development of the educational material was carried out in the urban area of Buenaventura (main city in the Colombian Pacific coast) in 1995. The design was {{based on the results of}} a knowledge, beliefs, and practices study in the city. By using the PRECEDE- PROCEED MODEL strategy, community groups were brought together with the research team to design the materials. Results: The educational materials were designed according to cultural and ethnographic characteristics of the population studied. These materials are table games, comics, <b>videotapes</b> and <b>cassettes,</b> magazines, altogether in a black bag called «The world of malaria: let´s learn to handle it in the community». Conclusions: This innovative educational material shows that interventions in public health should be based on results from scientific projects, because control strategies are based on local realities...|$|R
40|$|Often {{times it}} is {{desirable}} to record events such as lectures, training sessions, and meetings {{so that they may}} be reviewed later. Current techniques for creating such recordings, such as video cameras and tape recorders, are inadequate because they fail to capture enough of the essence of an event. Attempting to use multiple media to capture more of an event results in a cumbersome collection of <b>videotapes,</b> audio <b>cassettes,</b> and papers that is difficult or impossible to play back in a synchronized manner. In addition, such analog recordings are difficult to browse. The main reason for these difficulties is that the media exist largely in isolation from one another. This research describes a digital solution for capturing events while preserving as much of the event as possible. Multiple media are captured digitally as separate, but associated, time-correlated streams. Because the streams are kept separate and represented digitally, there are opportunities for utilizing sophisticated searching and browsing techniques, and flexible distribution paradigms. Th...|$|R
50|$|Because {{the live}} {{wraparound}} sequences for Nightmare Theatre was shot on half-inch <b>videotape,</b> the master <b>cassettes</b> were regularly recycled by the program's producers for economical reasons.

The only introduction from Nightmare Theatre known to exist—about two minutes worth of footage—has been saved for posterity on the J.P. Patches: Memories video and the J.P. Patches DVD Collection. A few audio clips have survived as well, recorded by young fans with portable tape recorders during its original run, which have recently surfaced on the Internet.|$|R
50|$|A {{library is}} a {{collection}} of sources of information and similar resources, made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing. It provides physical or digital access to material, and may be a physical building or room, or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, <b>cassettes,</b> <b>videotapes,</b> DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, and other formats. Libraries range in size from a few shelves of books to several million items. In Latin and Greek, the idea of a bookcase is represented by Bibliotheca and Bibliothēkē (Greek: βιβλιοθήκη): derivatives of these mean library in many modern languages, e.g. French bibliothèque.|$|R
50|$|The current {{collection}} of books and bound periodicals totals over 328,000 volumes, 32% in science, 21% in engineering, 24% in humanities, and 23% in social sciences. It has over 23,000 volumes in Arabic and over 300,000 volumes in English and subscribes to approximately 1,500 periodicals. In addition, there are some 490,000 research reports on microfiche and 63,000 documents in other media, including more than 25,000 educational films and 38,000 reels of journal back issues on microfilm. Audiovisual materials are provided through a well-equipped audio-visual (AV) department with a collection consisting principally of motion pictures, filmstrips, <b>videotapes,</b> and audio <b>cassettes.</b> These AV materials {{can be used in}} the library auditorium which is also used for seminars, lectures, short courses, theses defense, and other presentations.|$|R
50|$|During {{the legal}} {{proceedings}} concerning the Andijan events initiated on September 20, 2005, the Deputy Solicitor General of the Republic accused Tadjibayeva of anti-government activity under the false {{name of a}} human rights activist. Mutabar Tadjibayeva was invited to an international conference on human rights protection in Dublin fixed on October 8, 2005. She was {{expected to make a}} speech at the conference on the Andijan events. However, on October 7, 2005, Mutabar Tadjibayeva was arrested by security officers of the Ministry of Interior of Uzbekistan on a charge of deceptive practices. After the arrest the house of Tadjibayeva was searched and her personal affairs were confiscated. Despite the fact that only Mutabar Tadjibaeva in person was incriminated, the members of the ‘’Fiery Hearts Club’’ were searched as well, besides all the documents and materials (<b>videotapes,</b> audio <b>cassettes,</b> etc.) were confiscated too. For 10 days Mutabar was being detained in temporary detention facilities of Ferghana region. Later on, she was kept in other pretrial detention facilities for 4 months and underwent numerous interrogations. During the investigation Mutabar had finally learnt the reasons of her arrest. It was human rights activity against the interests of administrative officials and the ‘’Fiery Hearts Club’s’’ governing.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on a community's {{desires and}} needs, public {{libraries}} may offer many other resources {{and services to}} the public. In addition to print books and periodicals, most public libraries today have {{a wide array of}} other media including audiobooks, e-books, CDs, <b>cassettes,</b> <b>videotapes,</b> and DVDs. In 2015, certain libraries started to stock general materials for borrowing, such as pots, pans, sewing machines, and similar household items in order to appeal to a larger population. Collections of books and academic research related to the local town or region are common, along with collections of works by local authors. Libraries' storage space and lending systems may be used to lend a wide range of materials, including works of art, cake pans, seeds, tools and musical instruments. Similar to museums and other cultural institutions, libraries may also host exhibits or exhibitions.|$|R

50|$|Also, countless educational, medical, industrial, and promotional videotapes {{produced}} {{from the late}} 1950s up to the mid-1980s were also transferred to film stock (usually 16 mm film) for widespread distribution, using either an EBR or CRT recorder. This was done due to VCRs and VTRs then not being commonplace in most schools, hospitals, boardrooms, and other institutional settings, due to their high cost and the multitudes of proprietary (and incompatible) open-reel, cartridge, & <b>cassette</b> <b>videotape</b> formats {{in the early years}} of industrial-market videotape recorders starting in the mid-to-late 1960s. But 16 mm projectors were widely available at the time in such settings, making distribution of such video productions on 16 mm film more practical. One company that specialized in the transfer of videotape-originated programming to 16mm film in the 1970s and 1980s was Image Transform, a company that specialized in and developed its own technologies for video-to-film transfer. Such transfers were the case until the mid-1980s, when the VCR became affordable enough (and much more standardized in the form of VHS and Betamax) to be adopted in such institutional settings on a widespread basis.|$|R
50|$|U-matic is an {{analogue}} recording videocassette format first shown by Sony in prototype in October 1969, and {{introduced to the}} market in September 1971. It {{was among the first}} video formats to contain the <b>videotape</b> inside a <b>cassette,</b> as opposed to the various reel-to-reel or open-reel formats of the time. Unlike most other cassette-based tape formats, the supply and take-up reels in the cassette turn in opposite directions during playback, fast-forward, and rewind: one reel would run clockwise while the other would run counter-clockwise. A locking mechanism integral to each cassette case secures the tape hubs during transportation to keep the tape wound tightly on the hubs. Once the cassette is taken off the case, the hubs are free to spin. A spring-loaded tape cover door protects the tape from damage; when the cassette is inserted into the VCR, the door is released and is opened, enabling the VCR mechanism to spool the tape around the spinning video drum. Accidental recording is prevented by the absence of a red plastic button fitted to a hole on the bottom surface of the tape; removal of the button disabled recording.|$|R

To conduct a feasibility study of a multi-media catalogue envisaged as a publication listing film strips, tape recordings and other non-book materials. Main Topics : Variables A record is made of institutions' two main sources of audio-visual aid material, other than the British National Film Catalogue. A list of 24 types of materials is given (e. g. 35 mm film <b>cassettes,</b> <b>videotapes,</b> maps, etc.) and respondents are asked to mark off on a prepared grid whether their institutions keep/borrow/do not use each type of material listed, and also to record place material is kept - e. g. library. (If material is both kept and borrowed, respondents are asked to state this). Data also include: who controls materials used - teachers, librarian, administrative staff etc., where material is recorded (3 categories), completeness of information recorded (3 -point scale), how recorded (i. e. by author, title or subject), whether there is subject access, if so, whether by classification scheme, word arrangement or other and whether this arrangement is on shelf, in list or on cards. Whether the user's attention is drawn particularly to this material, if so, how. Finally, whether there is any one material that respondent finds unduly difficult to obtain (he is asked to specify).

40|$|During th,e era of analog technology, musical {{works were}} stored by {{encoding}} {{the works in}} a physical medium, such as music <b>cassettes,</b> <b>videotapes,</b> vinyl records {{and other forms of}} magnetic tapes. Reproduction of any musical work from those media would result in deterioration in quality of the reproduced music. This was {{a direct result of the}} inherent nature of analog technology. At that time, music piracy, which typically took the form of the unauthorized reproduction of music into records or cassettes which were then illegally sold for commercial gains, was a phenomenon which was not as serious as it is today. The deterioration in quality upon subsequent reproductions of analog works and the limitations of reproduction equipment served as a natural obstacle to widespread music piracy. All these were to change with the advent of digital technology, which allowed the means of reproducing an unlimited number of perfect copies very speedily, without any loss (n the quality of the reproduced music. CD and DVD burners became a common feature and contributed to the incidence of music piracy. At the same time, further developments in digital technology and the Internet have made it possible for Internet users to access, reproduce and store Internet contents. The music industry is currently undermined by the availability of file sharing of music services over the Internet using peer-to-peer technology. Peer-to-peer technology enables Internet users to exchange fifes with each other directly or through an intermediary server. In the light of the current serious state of music piracy worldwide and, also, in Malaysia, this paper examines the legal weapons which are available in Malaysia to combat music piracy, both in the physical and digital world. It also discusses the efforts of the Malaysian Government and music organizations in the country to curb the incidence of music piracy...|$|R
