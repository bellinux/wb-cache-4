40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} advantages of collocation method is the possibility of dealing with nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) as well as PDEs with <b>variable</b> <b>coefficients.</b> A numerical solution based on a Jacobi collocation method is extended to solve nonlinear coupled hyperbolic PDEs with <b>variable</b> <b>coefficients</b> subject to initial-boundary nonlocal conservation conditions. This approach, based on Jacobi polynomials and Gauss-Lobatto quadrature integration, reduces solving the nonlinear coupled hyperbolic PDEs with <b>variable</b> <b>coefficients</b> to a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equation which is far easier to solve.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of nonlinear pulse propagation in an averaged dispersion-managed soliton system {{is governed by}} a <b>variable</b> <b>coefficient</b> nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE). For a special set of parameters the <b>variable</b> <b>coefficient</b> NLSE is completely integrable. The same <b>variable</b> <b>coefficient</b> NLSE is also applicable to optical fiber systems with phase modulation or pulse compression. For such <b>variable</b> <b>coefficient</b> NLSE, solitary waves have been computed earlier in the literature either by the inverse scattering transform or the Bäcklund transformation. The Hirota bilinear method is shown to be applicable here too, and this modified format is employed to compute the exact bright and dark soliton solutions and the periodic waves solutions. The analysis is also extended to the coupled <b>variable</b> <b>coefficient</b> NLSEs. The merit of the Hirota bilinear approach is demonstrated clearly as periodic and solitary waves are obtained even for nonintegrable coupled systems. The validity of the new solutions is verified directly and independently by the software Mathematica. © 2005 The Physical Society of Japan. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
