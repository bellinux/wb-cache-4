A most narrow stand for a great Nation to base itself on! A stand which, with all the Corn-Law Abrogations conceivable, I do not think will be capable of enduring.|$|R

60|$|Peace {{had been}} made after the Crimean war, and {{everybody}} hoped {{it was going to}} last, when <b>very</b> <b>sad</b> <b>news</b> came from India. You know I told you the English people had gone to live in India, and had gradually gained more and more lands there, so that they were making themselves rulers and governors over all that great country. They had some of the regiments of the English army to help them to keep up their power, and a great many soldiers besides--Hindoos, or natives of India, who had English officers, and were taught to fight in the English manner. These Hindoo soldiers were called Sepoys. They were not Christians, but were some of them Mahommedans, and some believed in the strange religion of India, which teached people to believe in a great many gods--some of them very savage and cruel ones, according to their stories, and which forbids them many very simple things. One of the things it forbids is the killing a cow, or touching beef, or any part of it.|$|E

50|$|Aubrey {{learns that}} Surprise is {{to return to}} England to be sold or scrapped, <b>very</b> <b>sad</b> <b>news.</b> Maturin is in a mood to gamble at cards. Wray loses their piquet games, betting more than the cash he has on hand, and thus owes Maturin, who asks for naval favors in return, like a ship for recently-promoted Pullings. Before {{despatching}} Surprise to England, Ives asks Aubrey to take the Adriatic convoy up to Trieste. There he meets Captain Cotton of HMS Nymphe, who has just rescued the escaped prisoner-of-war, Lieutenant Charles Fielding. Maturin removes a bullet from Fielding, who is a brave man, but also a very jealous one. He hears the rumour of Aubrey's liaison {{with his wife and}} refuses to return to Malta on Surprise, challenging Aubrey to a duel when they next meet on land. On this return journey Captain Dundas, commanding HMS Edinburgh, tells Aubrey of a French privateer, which Aubrey then captures with Dryad in convoy. The chase delays Surprise into port, two days behind Babbington's sloop Dryad, so the news of Lieutenant Fielding's rescue has begun to circulate. Maturin speeds to Mrs Fielding's house, but she is not home. Lesueur and Boulay, a double agent on the Governor's staff, arrive to kill her, as she is of no more use to them, and have already killed Ponto. Instead, Maturin quietly listens to their conversation until they leave. When she arrives, he takes her aboard the Surprise, saving her life.|$|E
50|$|The {{summer of}} 1991 saw the club {{installed}} as favourites for the Conference title alongside Colchester United. There was some <b>very</b> <b>sad</b> <b>news</b> when former player Kevin Durham {{died of a}} brain haemorrhage whilst on holiday. Wycombe's share of the gate receipts from the Conference Championship shield against his club Barnet were donated to a fund for his son. Martin O'Neill made two hugely influential signings, bringing in defender Jason Cousins from Brentford and goalkeeper Paul Hyde, a £15,000 signing from Hayes The season started with seven successive wins but it all came crashing down in September with two successive home defeats. The first, a 1-0 reverse to Macclesfield Town was surrounded in controversy after John Timmons scored the winner after handling the ball. Both Mickey Nuttell and Jason Cousins were sent off and referee Royston Osbourne had been escorted from the pitch. Disaster was to follow a week later when title rivals Colchester United made the journey to Buckinghamshire in dreadful conditions. In driving rain and gale-force winds, and an ugly atmosphere which saw Police on horseback on the pitch, the visitors took an early second half lead through Nicky Smith but were soon pegged back by a Steve Guppy equaliser. The game seemed destined for a draw when in the last minute Colchester goalkeeper Scott Barrett's goal kick caught on the wind, bounced once over Hyde and into the top corner of the net. It was a massive blow but Martin O'Neill's men recovered and kept pace with their full-time adversaries. The return match in December was also one to forget, with the U's winning 3-0.|$|E

40|$|A gentle {{giant of}} {{learning}} and inspiration peacefully passed away on August 19, 2012 at home in Los Angeles, {{at the age of}} 76 years. Om’s academic accomplishments speak for them-selves. But they don’t convey the gleam that was always in his eye, nor his infectious smile. He only had positive things to say and was always encouraging. He was a great man, whose profound learning, humility and gentle approach to others will be a lifelong source of inspiration to those who knew him. The entire sarcoidosis community is mourning the passing of a true friend and academic teacher. For those of us lucky enough to know him, his passing is <b>very</b> <b>sad</b> <b>news.</b> For those of you who had not met him, you have missed a great opportunity. Om always spoke with a calm reassurance, yet he was very passionate about many things. Many of us have our favourite Om stories, but they mostly centre around how he encouraged us. Om Sharma was truly a great clinician and teacher, who not only added new knowledge to the mysteries of sarcoidosis, but kept news of this disease important for patients and physicians outside the field. His persona embodied the best qualities of a mentor, and of a wonderful and generous friend. Beside his professional merits we would like to stress Om Sharma’s outstanding commitment towards his patients...|$|E
