40|$|During rapid {{high-temperature}} events, like {{a terrorist}} attack with radiological dispersal device, radiological material will be released into the environment. In these scenarios, the ratio between parent and daughter nuclides {{can be used for}} nuclear forensic investigations to determine the age of the used radioactive source. We have used fast laser heating to produce aerosols of a material often found in radioisotope thermoelectric generators. To investigate the behaviour of SrTiO 3, we have recreated pure and mixed samples, mimicking several parent-to-daughter ratios. By combining scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis with Raman spectroscopy, we were able to distinguish different elements and phases present in the aerosols. Two types of aerosols have been identified: individual aerosols from a few micrometre to a few tens of micrometre and agglomerates of smaller aerosols from a few hundred nanometre to a few micrometre. The bigger aerosols, formed from mechanically expelled liquefied material, showed a parent-to-daughter ratio that stays close to the value that would be anticipated by the initial composition of the material, but in the agglomerates, formed from <b>vaporised</b> <b>material,</b> the presence of the daughter elements reduces significantly due to differences in the condensation behaviour.

40|$|Pulsed wave fibre lasers are {{becoming}} a popular industrial tool in microprocessing due to their many positive features, such as high beam quality, high reliability and high productivity, which are fundamental to machining small, precise features of industrial applications. However, the lasers’ use in the machining of ultra-precise features, such as small holes, is hindered {{by the fact that}} commercial pulsed wave fibre lasers commonly operate with pulse durations in the nanosecond regime. Such long pulse durations mean that the material is thermally removed, which results in the production of a melted layer and thermal damage in the bulk material. Consequently, the typical thermal defects of the melting regime, such as spattering of recast material around the hole, taper, heat-affected zone and poor hole circularity, are found in materials machined with these lasers. This paper proposes a design for an innovative nozzle that combines the high productivity of nanosecond fibre lasers with an improvement in the quality of the machined holes by reducing the spatter production in titanium laser percussion drilling. The innovative nozzle is based on the suction effect created by the Venturi principle that prevents the deposition of melted and <b>vaporised</b> <b>material</b> on the workpiece surface. The influence of the nozzle configuration and shielding gas on hole quality is investigated after the laser percussion drilling of 0. 5 mm-thick titanium sheets, in which the process conditions that allow maximum productivity are used. The innovative nozzle produces a remarkable decrease in spatter on the entrance hole surface without affecting the other quality features, such as hole diameter, circularity and taper, while preserving the high productivity obtainable with a standard nozzle...|$|E

The high power of the discharge, above 5 kilowatts {{for less than a}} microsecond, can melt and <b>vaporise</b> <b>materials.</b> Thin-film resistors may have their value altered by a discharge path forming across them, or having part of the thin film vaporized; this can be problematic in precision applications where such values are critical.|$|R
40|$|Single, {{double and}} {{multiple}} Q-switch Nd:YAG laser pulses {{are used to}} <b>vaporise</b> <b>material</b> from solid steel samples and to induce a plasma. The material ablation of different pulse bursts, emission intensities of iron lines and electron temperatures and densities are determined. Material ablation is found to increase with multiple pulses compared to single pulses of fixed total energy as well as electron temperatures and densities. Line intensities can be increased {{by a factor of}} about two using double pulses. Quantitative microchemical analysis of low-alloy steel is performed with single and double pulses. The analytical performance is improved by the double-pulse technique...|$|R
5000|$|A hot-wire foam cutter {{is a tool}} used to cut {{polystyrene}} foam and similar materials. The device consists of a thin, taut metal wire, often made of nichrome or stainless steel, or a thicker wire preformed into a desired shape, which is heated via electrical resistance to approximately 200°C. As the wire is passed through the material to be cut, {{the heat from the}} wire <b>vaporises</b> the <b>material</b> just in advance of contact.|$|R
40|$|A concave-shaped {{bearing element}} {{is made by}} vacuum coating with a {{diffusion}} barrier layer (3) followed by a dispersion alloy bearing layer (4). The thickness of both these layers is thicker at the centre (5) and reduces towards the edge (6). The thickness of the bearing layer is given by: D/d = (2 Ro/ 2 R+Ro) + 1, where D is the thickness at the centre (5), d the thickness at the edge (6), R is the radius of the element, and Ro is a constant of 20 - 60 mm. The bearing dispersion alloy {{is made up of}} Al, Pb, Cd, Sn, Zn, Ni, Cu, pref. 15 - 35 % Sn, 0. 1 - 3 Cu and balance Al. The components in the alloy are mainly in metallic form with only a small fraction in oxide, nitride or carbide form. The diffusion barrier layer is made up of Ni, Ni/Sn, Ni/Cu, Ni/Cr, Ti or titanium nitride. The coatings are produced in a vacuum with the <b>vaporising</b> <b>material</b> at a fixed distance of 150 - 350 mm from the element and a condensation rate of at least 80 nm/sec is established. Alternatively, there can be relative movemen t between the vapour source and the element with the normal at point (5) always being plus or minus 45 deg., pref. plus or minus 22 deg. with the line joining point (5) and the vapour source. The coating processes may be carried out in a reactive gas such as oxygen, nitrogen or hydrocarbon compounds and/or plasma activated gas.

50|$|Meteors become visible between about 75 to 120 km above Earth. They usually {{disintegrate}} at altitudes of 50 to 95 km. Meteors have {{roughly a}} fifty {{percent chance of}} a daylight (or near daylight) collision with Earth. Most meteors are, however, observed at night, when darkness allows fainter objects to be recognized. For bodies with a size scale larger than 10 cm to several meters meteor visibility {{is due to the}} atmospheric ram pressure (not friction) that heats the meteoroid so that it glows and creates a shining trail of gases and melted meteoroid particles. The gases include <b>vaporised</b> meteoroid <b>material</b> and atmospheric gases that heat up when the meteoroid passes through the atmosphere. Most meteors glow for about a second.|$|R
5000|$|Perlite softens when {{it reaches}} {{temperatures}} of [...] Water trapped {{in the structure of}} the <b>material</b> <b>vaporises</b> and escapes, and this causes the expansion of the material to 7-16 times its original volume. The expanded material is a brilliant white, due to the reflectivity of the trapped bubbles. Unexpanded ("raw") perlite has a bulk density around 1100 kg/m3 (1.1 g/cm3), while typical expanded perlite has a bulk density of about 30-150 kg/m3 (0.03-0.150 g/cm3).|$|R
40|$|In laser {{percussion}} drilling, {{a series}} of laser pulses with specified energies and durations irradiate the workpiece surface to gradually heat, melt, and <b>vaporise</b> <b>material</b> until a hole with-required depth-and-diameter-is-achieved. Despite being the quickest technique for producing small diameter holes, laser percussion drilling regularly suffers from difficulties in controlling the hole quality such as hole circularity, hole taper and recast layer. Therefore, {{in order to produce}} holes to a specific requirement at minimum cost and time, it is crucial to fully understand the effects of each parameter on hole quality. In this research, a new mathematical model for multiple pulsed laser drilling is developed to predict the hole depth, hole taper, and recast layer thickness, and to investigate the effects of key laser parameters on hole dimensions. The new model accounts for recoil pressure, melt ejection, O 2 assist gas effects, as well as solidification of the melt. The development of-the new model is divided into two stages; pulse on stage where interaction between laser beam-material takes place, and pulse off stage where solidification of the melt is modelled. Governing equations are established from heat conduction, energy, and mass equations at the solid-liquid and liquid-vapour interfaces with appropriate boundary and initial conditions. Analytical solutions are derived by using Mathematica 7 software as a tool to solve the system of non-linear equations. To validate the model, experimental work has been conducted and the measured results are compared to those calculated from the model. It is shown that the new model gives a good prediction of the hole depth and acceptable prediction of the recast layer thickness. Laser peak power and pulse width are shown to have a significant influence over the drilled hole quality whereas the changes due to pulse frequency are less pronounced.

40|$|The laser {{has given}} {{manufacturing}} industry a new tool. When the laser beam is focused it can generate {{one of the}} world's most intense energy sources, more intense than flames and arcs, though similar to an electron beam. In fact the intensity is such that it can <b>vaporise</b> most known <b>materials.</b> The laser material processing industry has been growing swiftly as the quality, speed and new manufacturing possibilities become better understood. In the fore of these new technologies {{is the process of}} laser cutting. Laser cutting leads because it is a direct process substitu­ tion and the laser can usually do the job with greater flexibility, speed and quality than its competitors. However, to achieve these high speeds with high quality con­ siderable know how and experience is required. This information is usually carefully guarded by the businesses concerned and has to be gained by hard experience and technical understanding. Yet in this book John Powell explains in lucid and almost non­ technical language many of these process wrinkles concerning alignment, cornering, pulsing, water jets, material properties, cutting speeds as well as tricks with surface coating and much much more. It is a book which managers and technicians in laser job shops and laser processing facilities would be foolish not to read...|$|R
