500|$|Early cricketers {{played in}} their {{everyday}} clothes and had no protective equipment such as gloves or pads. A 1743 painting of a game in progress at the Artillery Ground depicts two batsmen and a bowler dressed alike in white shirt, breeches, white knee-length stockings and shoes with buckles. The wicket-keeper wears the same clothes {{with the addition of}} a waistcoat. An umpire and scorer wear three-quarter length coats and tricorn hats. Apart from the shirts and stockings, none of the clothes are white and no one wears pads or gloves. The ball is bowled underarm along the ground, as in bowls, at <b>varying</b> <b>speed</b> towards a wicket consisting of two stumps mounted by a single crosspiece. The batsman addresses the delivery with a bat that resembles a modern hockey stick, this shape being ideal for dealing with a ball on the ground. The modern straight bat evolved in the 1760s after bowlers began to [...] "give the ball air" [...] by pitching it. As a result, [...] "the game changed completely and evolved from its pioneering phase into what may be termed its pre-modern phase".|$|E
500|$|Before {{entering}} battle, {{players can}} choose {{a certain number}} of characters to use in the battle from a roster of up to 46 characters. [...] The roster grows as the game progresses and more characters are recruited, and the number of characters able to be used varied between battles. [...] During battle, players have access to two species: the humanoid Beorc and the shape-shifting Laguz. Beorc use weapons and magic, while Laguz use close-quarters melee attacks. Laguz have a gauge which fills up during battle, filling at <b>varying</b> <b>speed</b> depending on their status and whether they are under attack. When the gauge is full, they transform into their animal form for a set number of turns, becoming far more powerful than Beorc characters. However, they are unable to attack while in human form, and are vulnerable until they transform again. [...] The time between transformations can be shortened using special items. Playable Beorc characters are each assigned a character class. These classes affect a character's skills and how far they can move on the battlefield. [...] Some classes are exclusive to certain characters: for example, the Ranger class and its skills are exclusive to Ike. Laguz characters also have different movement speeds and strengths depending on their transformed form.|$|E

40|$|The {{stability}} of car-following was examined utilizing a newly developed recorder {{of the distance}} between cars. Eight undergraduate and graduate school students (seven men, one woman) joined this experiment. At <b>varying</b> <b>speeds,</b> the drivers followed the lead car under the instructions of maintaining a 15 m distance between cars, maintaining the distance by counting one second mentally, and then again maintaining the distance by counting the beats on a metronome set at one-second intervals. Results showed the most {{stability of}} driving under the instruction of the metronome with one-second intervals at <b>varying</b> <b>speeds.</b> Similar results were achieved under the instructions of the metronome with three-second intervals at <b>varying</b> <b>speeds.</b> Introducing a device which provides a driver with an objective count seems {{to be effective in}} the maintenance of a stable distance between cars...|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to lighting, electric motors (analogous to generators operating in reverse, or using a current to spin a magnet to perform work) became {{extremely important to}} industry. Speed control of early DC motors limited their use. [...] Frank J. Sprague developed the first successful DC motor (ca. 1886) by solving the problem of <b>varying</b> <b>speed</b> with load. [...] Within a few years DC motors were used in electric street railways. In 1888, a Serbian immigrant, Nikola Tesla, a former employee of Edison's, patented an AC induction motor and licensed it to the Westinghouse Corporation. Electric motors eventually replaced steam engines in factories around the nation as they required neither complex mechanical transmissions from a central engine nor water sources for steam boilers in order to operate.|$|E
2500|$|At 16:15 on 6 October, TheSullivans sortied {{with the}} {{carriers}} and protected them during raids against targets on Formosa and the Ryukyus. On {{the evening of}} the 12th, as the planes returned to the carriers, radar spotted the first of many Japanese aircraft coming down from the north. For the next six hours, approximately 50 to 60 Japanese aircraft subjected the American task force to continuous air attacks. Nearly 45minutes after sunset, TheSullivans sighted a [...] "Betty," [...] coming in low on the starboard side, and took it under fire. During the next 15minutes, the formation to which TheSullivans was attached shot down three planes; between 18:56 and 19:54, the destroyer herself took five planes under fire. <b>Varying</b> <b>speed</b> between 18 and , the formation undertook eight emergency maneuvers.
