40|$|In many countries, {{including}} those in the European Union, Japan, Australia, and China, labeling is required for foods that contain genetically modified material. Other countries, including the United States, do not require mandatory labeling of GM foods. The United States, however, does allow firms to voluntarily label their products as non-GM. This {{raises the question of}} whether a mandatory <b>labeling</b> or <b>voluntary</b> <b>labeling</b> policy is more efficient. Proponents of <b>voluntary</b> <b>labeling</b> policies say they are less expensive, because only the firms that wish to label their products must incur the labeling costs. In a mandatory labeling regime, all firms would need to incur additional costs, whether the costs are due to product testing, label design, segregation, mistakes in labeling, etc. Many proponents of mandatory labeling of GM foods say that consumers have a "right to know" what they are eating and proponents claim that governments should mandate labels for foods made through genetic modification. This paper presents empirical evidence on consumers' value for foods with positive (i. e. this food is made with genetic engineering) labels versus and for foods with negative (i. e. this food is made without genetic engineering) labels. The positive label is likely to occur under a mandatory <b>labeling</b> <b>system,</b> while the negative label is likely to occur in a voluntary system. Thus, we present evidence on the consumer value of different labeling policies. We estimate values using a laboratory auction experiment performed on 142 randomly chosen adult consumers in the Des Moines, IA, and Saint Paul, MN, areas, grouped in 8 experimental units. They participated in a random nth-price auction experiment, in which they bid on three familiar neutral food items (an oil, a processed food, and a fresh food) that may be genetically modified. Experimental units are randomly assigned to the labeling treatment (i. e., food items with accurate GM food labels versus no food labels). Using statistical design and econometric analysis, this paper will estimate the average value of food label regimes to consumers. This will be measured as the difference in the auction price of a particular food item with and without a GM food label. We present evidence that shows that a <b>voluntary</b> <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> elicits the same consumer reaction as a mandatory <b>labeling</b> <b>system.</b> Because a <b>voluntary</b> <b>labeling</b> policy would be less expensive to implement, this paper provides evidence that the United States should not abandon the current <b>voluntary</b> <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> for a mandatory one. This information could be useful to U. S. public policy makers who must decide on GM food labeling legislation. Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} ‘environmental consumption’ helps in {{developing}} {{an interest in}} eco-labels. This is a shift away from traditional command and control measures imposed by governments towards market governance which is a self-regulatory new environmental policy instrument, eco-labelling. Taken into consideration of this eco-labels potentiality to attain sustainability, various eco-labelling schemes have been introduced since early 90 ’s. Ecolabels is a <b>voluntary</b> <b>labelling</b> <b>systems</b> for food and consumer products. They are a form of sustainability measurement directed at consumers, intended {{to make it easy}} to take environmental concerns into account when shopping. Some labels quantify pollution or energy consumption by way of index scores or units of measurement; others simply assert compliance with a set of practices or minimum requirements for sustainability or reduction of harm to the environment. The EU Ecolabel is a <b>voluntary</b> product <b>label.</b> It was established in 1992 to encourage businesses to market products and services that meet high standards of environmental performance and quality. The labels are awarded according to environmental criteria set by the member states of the EU with involvement of industry and consumer and environmental NGOs European Commission of Environment. These criteria cover the whole life cycle of a product, from the extraction of raw materials, through manufacture, distribution, use and disposal of the product. These assessment criteria are not generic and specific products and services have their own criteria. There is a significant body of legislation that has been assembled to back up the EU Eco Label which has been periodically reviewed since 1992 to keep the text up to date and ensure that lessons learned in the implementation of ecolabel schemes are incorporated. The EU Ecolabel is part of a broader EU Action Plan on Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy adopted by the European Commission on 16 July 2008, which also links the Flower to other EU policies such as Green Public Procurement (GPP) and Ecodesign of Energy Using products...|$|R

Interestingly, both <b>labelling</b> <b>systems</b> have resulted in very little, if any, additional consumer choice. Using an analytical model, we show that the coexistence of GM and non-GM products at the retail level depends on the labelling policy, consumer perceptions, and the type of product.

5000|$|The 1992 United States presidential {{election}} saw Bill Clinton choose Senator Al Gore as his vice presidential running mate. This decision disturbed many democrats and music industry professionals, including Klein, because Gore's wife, Tipper Gore, with Susan Baker, had co-founded the Parents Music Resource Center. The PMRC had initiated senate hearings in 1985 on [...] "potentially harmful lyrics", spearheading a five-year effort that by 1990 had successfully forced {{the recording industry}} to implement a <b>voluntary</b> identification and <b>labeling</b> <b>system</b> to warn parents about music containing explicit lyrics.

40|$|Abstract:- Actually, in the {{agri-food}} sector {{there has been}} the springing up of <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>labelling</b> <b>systems</b> used as instruments for environmental communication and useful to obtain a commercial feed-back of eco-sustainable management. The result is a large variety and it becomes extremely difficult and complex for the operators to choose the most effective label able to explain the values of their environmental involvement {{and the application of}} the operating modes of the chosen <b>labelling</b> <b>system.</b> This paper proposes the results of an exploratory survey, carried out through a suitable questionnaire, built up by us, on variables concerning the implementation of environmental labels in small and medium enterprises of agri-food. In order to have a survey as general as possible, this questionnaire has been proposed to some Sicilian companies of various sizes, located in the provinces of Catania and Syracuse. The aim of the analysis is to investigate what are the steps of the production cycle, mandatory and voluntary regulations in the company, type of packaging used, voluntary eco-labelling and certification applied in the considered companies, kind of end-users, category of environmental impacts during different stages of production cycles in the diverse classes of companies interviewed. The answers obtained have been elaborated through the Rough Sets approach, a method of data analysis that allows us, through an easily understandable language, to describe relations in terms of decisional rules (if…, then…), among a series of attributes relating the different managerial and organizational problems and the critical points regarding the subject discussed. Some examples of such rules are shown in this paper as tables in order to point out the most interesting results obtained.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{determine}} the response of manufacturers and retailers to voluntary UK front of package (FOP) schemes through food product innovations. Design/methodology/approach – A food innovation database (Global New Products Database) was used to track all food products released in the UK from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2008. Meal, bakery and breakfast cereal products were classified into two groups, according to whether the food category was targeted by the Food Standard Agency (FSA) for FOP labelling. Analysis includes descriptive statistics and cross-tabulations of factors such as product category, type of FOP scheme, company, and year. Findings – Private label brands dominate food innovations in the UK. The use of FOP labels is selective among companies and across food categories. Guideline daily allowance (GDA) labelling is more widely adopted than the traffic light <b>labelling</b> <b>system</b> (TLS). Both systems have been more broadly adopted in target food categories when compared to non-target food categories. Research limitations/implications – The database used to conduct this research provides detailed data on food product innovations released in the UK. However, this is not linked to sales data and therefore cannot be used to analyse changes in consumption due to FOP <b>labelling</b> <b>systems.</b> Nevertheless, the response of food manufacturers and retailers in their innovation strategies is a critical piece to understanding how <b>voluntary</b> <b>labelling</b> polices may impact public health.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{represents}} the practical implementation of some guidelines {{developed in the}} context of a published book entitled “Product-Oriented Environmental Management System (POEMS). Improving Sustainability and Competitiveness in the Agri- Food Chain with Innovative Environmental Management Tools”. Nowadays, companies show growing interest in the most suitable instrument of environmental communication for the characteristics of their products (and the related sector) could be. This aspect becomes particularly important in the agri-food compartment where the products features are the result of the interaction among very different subsystems, from the farming to the transformation and marketing processes. Over time, in this sector, a huge number of <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>labelling</b> schemes <b>systems,</b> used as instruments of environmental communication, have sprung up. Consequently it becomes extremely difficult for the operators to choose the most suitable label for their needs. In this context these guidelines were established with the aim of representing an innovative tool which, through the evaluation of key aspects of the environmental impacts of a product, can support the Small and Medium sizes enterprises (SMEs) in their choice of the most suitable environmental label for their own product; they can also enhance their communication strategies and their visibility in the market. The company chosen for carrying out the implementation of these guidelines belongs to the Sicilian pistachio industrial sector and it is typical for its size and market within the Sicilian economic system.

40|$|This paper studies how {{information}} disclosed by <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>labels</b> creates incentives for firms {{to invest in}} environmentally-friendly production technologies. I develop a model with differentiated products and imperfectly-informed consumers. Consumers care about the environmental characteristics of goods (for example, how they were produced), but cannot directly observe these product characteristics. Firms differ in their abilities to develop "clean" technologies, but have no incentive to do so absent government regulation or a policy that provides information to consumers. A scheme of <b>voluntary</b> <b>labels,</b> awarded to firms that achieve some chosen level of environmental friendliness, gives some firms enough incentive to develop clean technologies, while others choose to produce "dirty" goods. Each consumer is individually ineffective in reducing aggregate environmental damage but consumers purchase products according to how they privately value environmental quality. I parameterize {{the relationship between the}} environmental quality consumers experience privately from their own consumption of a product and the intensity of its environmental damage.
