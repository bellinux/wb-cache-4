50|$|Carl Strandlund, an {{engineer}} with 150 patents, {{came up with}} the idea for enameled steel prefabricated homes during World War II, when he worked for a Chicago company that made <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> <b>products,</b> initially kitchenware, but later, architectural paneling used on some gas stations and restaurants, in particular, early White Castle outlets. After a conversation with Wilson Wyatt, director of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), he set up the Lustron Corporation in 1947 with the help of $12 million ($ in modern dollars) in federal loans. President Harry S Truman, who had appointed Wyatt, was concerned about the possible shortage of housing, as many men were due to leave the military in the coming years with the war over, yet there had been virtually no new residential construction since it had started in 1941.|$|R
40|$|The housing {{shortage}} in the United States {{at the close}} of World War II led President Truman and his National Housing Expediter, Wilson W. Wyatt, Sr., to enact the Veteran's Emergency Housing Act. Enacted in the spring of 1946, one goal of the V. E. H. A. was to encourage the production of prefabricated and factory-built housing units. The Lustron Homes Corporation, founded by Carl Strandlund, was a subsidiary of Chicago <b>Vitreous</b> <b>Enamel</b> <b>Products</b> Company which received over $ 37 million from the Federal Government between 19461950, in order to manufacture standardized all-steel houses. This creative project explores the wartime and postwar housing situation across the country, and specifically, in Louisville, Kentucky. An interview with Wilson W. Wyatt, Sr. is included. The production, assembly, and sales practices of the Lustron Homes Corporation are explored through research, and through an interview with the regional salesman who represented Kentucky.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> is a glassy coating {{formed on}} a metal {{substrate}} by firing at temperatures above 800 °C. The quality of <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> coating depends on the pre-treatment of the steel substrate surface {{and the quality of}} enamel slip. The main aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the composition of the steel substrate surface after firing with double finish, to explain the effect of steel substrate surface pre-treatment (blasting, acid pickling) on forming the phase interface of the steel substrate – vitreous coating system, and on its final microhardness, fracture strength and the adhesive properties of the coating. To achieve these aims, the following experimental methods were used: Mössbauer spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron analyzer, and EDAX. Based on the chemical composition of the initial enamel slip and the firing technology, the metal- enamel system interface exhibited various ratios of layers of magnetite, hematite, nonstoichiometric wüstite, and crystals of faylite. The measuring results indicate that the quality and age of enamel slip influences the brittle fracture properties of <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> coating...|$|R

You’ve probably seen the stuff: tables, saucepans, jugs, kettles …and exterior murals with enamel’.
