Influence of core NA and <b>V-parameter</b> on MI has been investigated numerically. It shows that core NA has larger influence on MI for fibers with smaller core-cladding-ratio, and the influence of core NA on threshold is more obvious when the amplifiers are pumped at 915 nm. The dependence of threshold on <b>V-parameter</b> revealed that the threshold increases linearly as <b>V-parameter</b> decreases when <b>V-parameter</b> is larger than 3. 5, and the threshold shows exponentially increase as <b>V-parameter</b> decreases when <b>V-parameter</b> is less than 3. 5. We also discussed the effect of linewidth on MI, which indicates that the influence of linewidth can be neglected for linewidth smaller than 1 nm when the fiber core NA is smaller than 0. 07 and fiber length is shorter than 20 m. Fiber amplifiers with different core NA were experimentally analyzed, which agreed with the theoretical predictions. Comment: 6 pages, 11 figure...|$|E

Numerical investigations demonstrate that an endlessly single-mode PCF with improved large mode area can be realised by introducing higher index {{material in the}} cladding region. Here we discuss how the <b>V-parameter</b> and effective mode area of the PCF can be improved by manipulating the cladding region rather than the core region itself. Moreover, the influence of doping levels with respect to confinement loss, chromatic dispersion and bending loss of the proposed PCF is also investigated by employing the full-vectorial finite element method (FEM) ...|$|E

The fibers are tested under continuous 60 Co-irradiation and pulsed irradiation. All measurements are performed at about 850 nm wavelength and room temperature. Due to different power distributions in SM-fibers with different V-parameters, the influence of radiation induced attenuation in the fluorine doped silica cladding is examined and the dependence of this attenuation on the fluorine concentration is shown.

This allows for systematic investigations on isolated parameters influencing the complex behavior of MI. A maximum MI threshold of 2 kW could be demonstrated for the tested fibers, which represents a new record output power for narrow linewidth fiber amplifiers. The MI threshold was found to sensitively depend on the <b>V-parameter</b> for large V-parameters (> 2), but to be robust for smaller V-parameters.

40|$|The {{beam quality}} factor M- 2 of {{multimode}} fiber lasers using coiling technique is studied {{based on the}} fiber bend loss theory. M- 2 is obtained through calculating bend loss and intensity change of different modes in a multimode fiber. The influence of bend-induced field deformation on M- 2 is evaluated. Relationship of M- 2 to coiling radius is studied for the multimode fiber lasers. It is shown that M- 2 keeps almost unchanged in some range of the coiling radius. The performance of mode selection is compared between fibers with the same <b>V-parameter</b> but different NA values.

30|$|In this paper, a {{hexagonal}} shape {{photonic crystal}} fiber (H-PCF) {{has been proposed}} as a gas sensor of which both micro-structured core and cladding are organized by circular air cavities. The reported H-PCF has a single layer circular core which {{is surrounded by a}} five-layer hexagonal cladding. The overall pretending process of the H-PCF is completed by using a full vectorial finite element method (FEM) with perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary condition. All geometrical parameters like diameters and pitches of both core and cladding regions have fluctuated with an optimized structure. After completing the numerical analysis, it is clearly visualized that the proposed H-PCF exhibits high sensitivity with low confinement loss. The investigated results reveal the relative sensitivity of 56.65 % and confinement loss of 2.31 × 10 - 5 dB/m at the 1.33 -μm wavelength. Moreover, effective area, nonlinearity, and <b>V-parameter</b> of the suggested PCF are also briefly described.|$|E

In this case the polarization is not analyzed. It is advisable to use in measurements {{two parts of the}} spectral line wing. It is well known that, in the magnetographic measurements using a spectrograph, an algebraic addition of different-polarity magnetic fluxes occures that fill the spectrograph entrance aperture. For filter magnetographs, the role of such an aperture is played by a limiting resolution determined under ground conditions by the "atmosphere-telescope" system. In a variety of observing programs involving the magnetic field topology, of the position and shape of the neutral line separating regions of different magnetic polarity is important. The above-mentioned factor leads to a serious uncertainty of these parameters deducible from magnetograms. For instance, parts of a neutral line with t [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] - Electromagnetic wave {{propagation}} inside one-dimensional photonic crystal fiber is numerically characterized by computing <b>V-parameter,</b> cladding index and effective mode profiles. Dependence on these parameters on geometrical {{structure of the}} fiber reflects the design tolerance, and corresponding modal characteristics. Air-hole spacing and periodicity are varied to observe the effect on V-parameter; along with effective core radius, which {{is a function of}} periodicity, is modified to see the effect on cladding index and effective mode profiles. Results obtained from empirical relations method are compared with analytical formula of Nielsen and Mortensen. Periodicity of the structure is regarded as numerically equal to the central wavelength of the desired range throughout the computation. Refractive index of the core is taken as independent of operating wavelength. Simulated parameters have critical importance to estimate the characteristics of photonic crystal fiber which will help the design engineers to study the performance at 870 nm, 1330 nm and 1550 nm...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} {{methods of}} the magnetic field measurement, based on {{an analysis of the}} relation between the Stokes <b>V-parameter</b> and the first derivative of the total line profile intensity, were modified by applying a linear integral operator L̂ to the both sides of this relation. As the operator L̂, the operator of the wavelet transform with DOG-wavelets is used. The key advantage of the proposed method is an effective suppression of the noise contribution to the line profile and the Stokes parameter V. The efficiency of the method has been studied using the model line profiles with various noise contributions. To test the proposed method, the spectropolarimetric observations of the A 0 -type star α^ 2 CVn, young O-type star θ^ 1 Ori C and A 0 supergiant HD 92207 were used. The longitudinal magnetic field strengths for these stars calculated by our method appeared to be in a good agreement with those determined by other methods. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

Optical supercontinuum generation in the proposed fiber using a 1064 nm pump source with peak power of 1 kW has been also presented. Finite difference time domain method (FDTD) has been employed to examine the optical properties such as fiber birefringence, mode field, <b>V-parameter,</b> walk-off and optical nonlinearity, while the Split-step Fourier method is used to solve the nonlinear Schrodinger equation felicitating the study of supercontinuum generation. Simulation results indicate that horizontal input pulse yields superior continuum in comparison {{to that of the}} vertically polarized input. However, the broadening of the continuum is about 1450 nm in case of horizontally polarized input light whereas it is approximately 2350 nm for vertically polarized.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of {{acoustic}} mode confinement on Stimulated Brillouin Scattering in optical waveguides that consist of a guiding core embedded in a solid substrate. We find that SBS can arise due to coupling to acoustic modes in three different regimes. First, the acoustic modes may be guided by total internal reflection; in this case the SBS gain depends directly on the degree of confinement of the acoustic mode in the core, which is in turn determined by the acoustic <b>V-parameter.</b> Second, the acoustic modes may be leaky, but may nevertheless have a sufficiently long lifetime to have a large effect on the SBS gain; the lifetime of acoustic modes in this regime depends not only on the contrast in acoustic properties between the core and the cladding, but is also highly dependent on the waveguide dimensions. Finally SBS may occur due to coupling to free modes, which exist {{even in the absence of}} acoustic confinement; we find that the cumulative effect of coupling to these non-confined modes results in significant SBS gain. We show how the different acoustic properties of core and cladding lead to these different regimes, and discuss the feasibility of SBS experiments using different material systems...|$|E
40|$|Microstructured {{optical fibers}} (MOFs) {{are one of}} the most {{exciting}} recent developments in fiber optics. A MOF usually consists of a hexagonal arrangement of air holes running down the length of a silica fiber surrounding a central core of solid silica or, in some cases air. MOFs can exhibit a number of unique properties, including zero dispersion at visible wavelengths and low or high effective nonlinearity [3]-[17], By varying the size of the holes and their number and position, one can also design MOFs with carefully controlled dispersive and modal properties. In this paper, we analyze and modeling the behavior of the photonic crystal fiber (PCF) by using in the first step a propagator method based on the BPM method. With our BPM software, the electric field contour of the fundamental mode of PCF was demonstrated. We also used it to see the variation of the effective index; an effective index model confirms that such a fiber can be single mode for any wavelength. It would make a study of photonic crystal fibers, and a study of the numerical simulation methods allow the simulation of optical properties and has modeled the propagation of light in this fiber type. After that we use the <b>V-parameter</b> because it offers a simple way to design a photonic crystal fiber (PCF), by basing in a recent formulation of this parameter of a PCF, we provide numerically based empirical expression for this quantity only dependent on the two structural parameters, the air hole diameter and the hole-to-hole center spacing.
