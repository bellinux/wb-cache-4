40|$|Abstract. Electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> are {{high-power}} load {{after they}} are accessed to the grid. Therefore it may result in the redistribution of the grid load, {{which leads to the}} change of the power flow and the grid loss increases. The load model of <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> is established in a typical distribution network model in this paper. The impact on the distribution network power flow after the electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> accessed to the grid is calculated. And then some measures to reduce the network loss are brought up, which are proved by relational calculation cases...|$|R
