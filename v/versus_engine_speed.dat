40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the {{performance}} and emission characteristics of a conventional four cylinder spark ignition (SI) engine operated on hydrogen and gasoline are investigated experimentally. The compressed hydrogen at 20 MPa has been introduced to the engine adopted to operate on gaseous hydrogen by external mixing. Two regulators {{have been used to}} drop the pressure first to 300 kPa, then to atmospheric pressure. The variations of torque, power, brake thermal efficiency, brake mean effective pressure, exhaust gas temperature, and emissions of NOx, CO, CO 2, HC, and O 2 <b>versus</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> are compared for a carbureted SI engine operating on gasoline and hydrogen. Energy analysis also has studied for comparison purpose. The test results have been demonstrated that power loss occurs at low speed hydrogen operation whereas high speed characteristics compete well with gasoline operation. Fast burning characteristics of hydrogen have permitted high speed engine operation. Less heat loss has occurred for hydrogen than gasoline. NOx emission of hydrogen fuelled engine is about 10 times lower than gasoline fuelled engine. Finally, both first and second law efficiencies have improved with hydrogen fuelled engine compared to gasoline engine. It has been proved that hydrogen is a very good candidate as an engine fuel. The obtained data are also very useful for operational changes needed to optimize the hydrogen fueled SI engine design...|$|E

The primary focus of this investigation is to parameterize the {{air induction}} system into three components, namely the diffuser, plenum, and runners, and to determine the internal geometric parameters most dominant for power generation with the goal of designing an air induction system to generate maximum performance for a given restricted internal combustion engine. This was accomplished through theoretical calculations; engine simulation and modeling using GT-Power; computational fluid dynamics modeling using SolidWorks Flow Simulation; and finally building a prototype of the final configuration for experimentation on an engine dynamometer. It was determined through these simulations that a symmetric air induction design featuring a 6. 0 ° diffuser angle, 0. 54 L plenum volume, and 5 " runner lengths proved to sustain an evenly distributed 19 % greater mass flow rate than the previous design, generating a 4. 8 % increase in power output and sustaining 95 % of peak torque output for 1000 RPM longer than the previous design.

The increase in pmax is about 0.9 MPa at 1, 500 rpm and 0.6 MPa at 2, 460 rpm passing through 0 MPa both at about 1, 900 and 2, 800 rpm. The noticeable increase in Tmax is about 60 K at 1, 500 rpm and 40 K at 2, 460 rpm passing through 0 K both at 1, 900 and 2, 800 rpm. These increases in pmax and Tmax are tolerable, as they are still below the allowable pressure and temperature of the conventional engine. Similar observations for the changes of brake efficiency and bsfc <b>versus</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> for operation under constant and variable compression ratios are shown in Figure 12. If the compression ratio is constant, the brake thermal efficiency varies between 36 % and 32.9 % passing through a maximum value of 37.3 % at an engine speed of 1, 900 rpm. In case of varying compression ratio (between 16.4 and 19.3 for maximum torque), the efficiency changes between 37.6 % at 1, 500 rpm and 36.5 % at 2, 460 rpm. In addition to gains in brake torque and efficiency, the figure shows {{a decrease in the}} bsfc over an engine speed ranging from 4.6 % at 1, 500 rpm to 2.7 % at 2, 460 rpm passing through 0 % both at 1, 900 and 2, 800 rpm.|$|E

50|$|To {{maximize}} acceleration, the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> of {{an automobile}} {{must be kept}} near that where maximum power is developed. For this reason, vehicles utilize transmissions; as the vehicle's speed increases such that the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> exceeds {{the speed at which}} maximum power is developed, the driver shifts to a higher (numerically lower ratio) gear, which reduces <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and allows continued acceleration.|$|R
5000|$|Overall, reduced <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> {{has benefited}} the sport {{because there is}} more racing, fewer {{accidents}} and breakdowns and racing fans get more value for their time and money invested in watching races.

40|$|The <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} signals in the engine management system of a combustion engine. The signal is used to control the fuel injection, estimate the engine torque, and to generate reference values. Combustions in the cylinders result in the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> oscillating around a momentary average, and many applications are depending on stable estimates of this average <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and the average acceleration. This thesis provides a signal model based method to estimate the momentary average <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and acceleration. The estimation of momentary average <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and acceleration is complicated by imperfections in the process of measuring the <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b> Limited accuracy in the measurements causes quantization distortion in the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> signal. The effects of these errors are investigated and quantified. A signal model representing the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> is developed and used to estimate the momentary average and acceleration using a Kalman filter. The regular Kalman filter cannot provide estimates with low noise levels at steady state and at the same time be fast enough to track the signal during transient behavior. This problem is overcome by extending the Kalman filter with a change detection algorithm. While this signal model based method gives a satisfying result, it is computationally complex. To evaluate its performance, it is compared to a moving average FIR filter, which is computationally less expensive but does not succeed as well as the signal model based method in filtering out all oscillations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) simulation to investigate the in-cylinder flow characteristics of 2 D combustion chamber for a hydrogen-fuelled four-stroke internal combustion engine.

The <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> was varied from 1000 to 3000 rpm, the range of equivalent ratio from 0. 6 to 1. 0 and the crank angle from 0 to 720 degrees in this study. The effect of the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and equivalence ratio on the flow-field characteristics and volumetric efficiency are investigated in the motoring condition. The increase of <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> gives a more efficient diffusion process for hydrogen and gives a more homogeneous air–fuel mixture structure.
