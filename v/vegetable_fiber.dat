25|$|Unlike other {{fruits and}} vegetables, where {{nutritional}} content such as vitamin C is diminished upon cooking, processing of tomatoes increases {{the concentration of}} bioavailable lycopene. Lycopene in tomato paste is up to four times more bioavailable than in fresh tomatoes. The reason is that in raw plant foods, lycopene is insoluble in water and is tightly bound to <b>vegetable</b> <b>fiber.</b> Processed tomato products such as pasteurized tomato juice, soup, sauce, and ketchup contain a higher concentration of bioavailable lycopene compared to raw tomatoes.|$|E
25|$|Bifrenaria are {{comparatively}} {{easy to grow}} orchids. They {{should be}} preferably potted on well drained <b>vegetable</b> <b>fiber</b> because their roots and pseudobulbs rot easily when kept humid for long periods. One of three different environments is needed depending on the species' origin to successfully grow these plants. The larger species need more light than the others. The smaller species from Southeast Brazil may be cultivated at the same medium temperature but under less than 10-20% luminosity. Bifrenaria from the Amazon Forest require higher and more constant temperature and humidity than other species. All species need most water and fertilizer during their active growth season.|$|E

The most popular contemporary dance, called kilalaky, is performed in a line and originated among Bara cattle rustlers. The specific style of musical accompaniment, also known as kilalaky, is performed on djembe, kabosy, electric guitar, bass guitar, drum kit and [...] keyboard. Bagzana and Tsiliva are considered among the most popular performers of kilalaky. The most typical musical instrument among the Bara is the lokanga, a fiddle with three strings made of goat gut or <b>vegetable</b> <b>fiber.</b>|$|E
