40|$|If any one {{policy has}} characterised the Conservative {{government}} in Britain since 1979 it is privatization. Although the policy was first canvassed in the United States, by the early 1990 s Britain had become the world leader and privatization the country's most <b>visible</b> <b>export</b> (1). Moreover, transport industries were very much {{at the forefront of}} the Thatcher revolution in industrial ownership and organisation. This paper firstly defines what is meant by privatization. Secondly, it assesses the economic reasons for privatization. Thirdly, it outlines the main privatizations that have occurred in the British transport market and assesses their impact. Fourthly, the applicability of the British experiment to other countries, particularly in the developing world, is considered. It is concluded that a necessary pre-requisite to privatization is commercialisation and as a result emphasis in many developing countries will be on reforming public enterprise rather than on out and out privatization...|$|E
40|$|This {{special issue}} focuses on India as an {{emergent}} and major global economy. The various articles selected for this issue provide an interesting set of perspectives that {{are facing the}} nation with the world’s second largest population. For macromarketing scholars, the issues addressed in this special issue are retail marketing developments; cultural issues concerning the most <b>visible</b> <b>export</b> of India, the ‘‘Bollywood’ ’ films; consumption choices in this growing economy; {{the rise of the}} middle class amid conditions of pov-erty; the gradual displacement of family businesses; and, finally, the branding of India for international travelers and cultural afi-cionados. Collectively, these articles make a significant contribution to the macromarketing literature. From a marketing standpoint, the story of resurgent India and the beginnings of a modern consumer economy begins in the early 1990 s. That is, in spite of many challenges and some failed experiments, India is moving forward rather rapidly, and there are many critical signs of progress on several fronts. As observed by many, India is a land of contradictions and contrasts. While many languages are spoken in this nation, it is still able to act as a unified body politic and projects a unique national culture. Although nobody claims the country has reached a state of economic bliss, for poverty still haunts India, one can say that things are looking up and India is moving closer to self-sufficiency in some key sectors (e. g., agriculture) and is a global player in others (e. g., IT and software pro-duction). With an annual growth rate between 7 percent and 9 percent, India seems to be forging ahead. Other factors key to our analysis are the rise of the transnational elite and the emerging global Indian consumer, the large segment of youthful productive population, an inflow of foreign capital, and advancement of living conditions...|$|E

Its <b>visible</b> <b>exports</b> amount {{to more than one}} fourth of the total output of the "monetized" part of the Kenyan economy. Moreover, the Kenyan export picture is much more varied than that of most African economies. Primary products account for only about half its exports; the remaining half, manufactures, are destined about equally to Kenya's East African Community (EAC) partners and {{to the rest of the}} world. Even within its exports of manufactures, Kenya's situation is complex, for the products which it exports to the developed world bear almost no resemblance to those it exports to its neighbors; and there are interesting differences between the exports to its EAC partners and those to other African and Middle Eastern destinations. These differences are explored and the general tenor of my doubts about Kenya's future as an exporter of manufactures is presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Maldives {{is a small}} island-atoll {{developing}} country dominated by the Indian Ocean. It has many of the typical characteristics associated with island developing countries. Island-atoll developing countries "face difficult development decisions in a world economy that has changed little {{to respond to the}} aspirations of the smallest states" (Connell, 1986 : 41). Smaller geographical size implies limited land based natural resource availability (see Tisdell and Fairbairn, 1983; Tisdell, 1987). The limited land based natural resource availability limits the foreign exchange earnings from their potential exports. Furthermore, even if diversification is possible, which is questionable, small size coupled with economies of scale in transport (brought about as a result of geographic isolation), production and marketing, limits the degree of diversification (Fairbairn and Kakazu, (1985). Also geographic isolation coupled with smallness is a disincentive to overseas investment. In addition, international financial institutions are not geared {{to the size of the}} smaller island states. Thus fluctuations in foreign exchange earnings from <b>visible</b> <b>exports</b> are quite high which makes the task of budgeting at all levels from government to the household precarious (Dommen, 1980) ...|$|R
40|$|Exporting {{is vital}} for both {{companies}} and a country. In the UK, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) data indicates that 135. 2 billion of <b>visible</b> <b>exports</b> and 122. 8 billion of invisible exports were earned in 1994 (see Central Statistics Office data for more details). The government spent nearly 200 {{million in the same}} period for the Overseas Trade Services export promotion. Unfortunately, a large gap exists in the academic literature concerning ways to evaluate export promotion policies and communication. This study addresses this issue and reports on an investigation which has been undertaken to evaluate ways in which government export assistance is promoted to companies and to concentrate on the methods of communication of these services. The proposed methodological approach that was used to undertake this research was in three stages. First, in the desk research stage, information was gathered on existing evaluation procedures. Co-operation had already been obtained from the Joint Directorate of Overseas Trade Services, involving access to certain internal reports. Second, empirical data were collected from a sample of UK companies to determine managers' perceptions towards the effectiveness of government export advertising, whether firms' assistance requirements were being met, and if they were being communicated with effectively. Third, interviews were carried out to obtain opinions from managers in order to add a qualitative dimension to the statistics generated from the postal survey. The findings indicate that the government's advertising of export assistance has not been effective. Conclusions are provided for policy makers together with recommendations for researchers to build on this study...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{some aspects of}} spatial reorganization in the Sugar Industry of Barbados. More specifically, it focuses on location allocation problems for sugar cane in both short term and future situations. The problems relate to the method of allocating canes between farms and factories, and to the reorganization of the factory system. The objective of the thesis {{is to create an}} efficient method of sugar cane allocation, and to arrive at location decisions for a reduced number of factories given increased efficiency in the industry as a desirable goal. [...] The methodology used is linear programming. This technique allows the utilization of scarce resources as effectively as possible, given the peculiar constraints of individual situations. Allocation solutions are found for the harvests of 1973 and 1974. The results yield valuable insights into the scheduling aspects of allocation, implications regarding locational advantage of the various estates and cane producing peasant farms, as well as a partial pricing structure for the industry. [...] From the allocation results the scope of the thesis develops to embrace the whole issue of centralization within a historical and contemporary context. Four factories are taken as the optimal number for an improved system and optimum locations are found for them as well as the resultant changed allocations. [...] The rationale for the thesis comes from the crucial importance of the sugar industry in the economy of the island with a contribution of over 50 % of the value of all <b>visible</b> <b>exports,</b> from the sale of sugar and by products. More importantly the industry is currently going through a period of crisis and if massive reorganization in all facets of its structure is not undertaken then collapse seems inevitable in the very near future. The thesis therefore suggests new approaches to some managerial aspects of reorganization, and the possible implications of any such changes for the entire Sugar Industry of Barbados...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston University. The {{economic}} {{problem of}} Greece {{is basically the}} persistent imbalance between resources and population. Previous attempts to establish the Greek economy on a long-run, sound economic basis by developing the domestic resources of the country fell short of their objective. In the past, the rate of resources utilization through capital investment, technological improvements, and institutional changes has been inadequate to support the growing population at a rising scale of living. Furthermore, post-war population growth may dissipate the economic gains achieved by foreign aid and may lead again to a new economic relapse. In Chapter I a concept of demographic equilibrium is developed which substitutes for the natural subsistence of the Malthusian equilibrium the concept of conventional subsistence and takes into consideration the attitudinal aspects of the people {{with regard to the}} scale of living. The objective of economic development is accepted as the establishment of conditions of demographic equilibrium achieved by a rate of resources utilization higher than the rate of population increase that results in a rising scale of living in accordance with desired standards. The approach in this study is historical and statistical. The objective is to analyze the direction which economic progress has taken in the past and to observe to what extent previous attempts were successful or unsuccessful in altering the course of economic change under a continuously growing population. Present developments are better understood when they are observed through conclusions drawn from past experience. The importance of natural resources is emphasized in Chapter II. The belief held among geographers that Greece constitutes an integral part of a world region termed AEgeis, a region occupying the greatest part of the eastern Mediterranean basin, cannot be explained without the presence of limited domestic resources on the Greek peninsula. These limited resources forced the surplus population to colonize and contributed to an economic prosperity based principally on transport-commerce- service activities. In the long history of Greece, the economic prosperity of the Greek peninsula was externally conditioned, depending on the changing economic significance of the region. In Chapter III a statistical analysis is conducted concerning the extent and nature of Greece's dependence on foreign trade. The propensity to trade and the per capita trade of Greece are the highest in the world. Measurements reveal that most of the increase in trade was necessary for the support of a growing population at an almost stationary scale of living. The persisting imbalance between population and domestic resources is also evidenced by a chronic trade deficit. Increasing visible imports were not met by a corresponding increase in <b>visible</b> <b>exports.</b> The deficit was met by invisible exports and borrowing. Furthermore, the chronic trade deficit indicates that Greece has never passed the borrowing stage. A cyclical trade disequilibrium was superimposed on the secular trade deficit. Measurements show that both <b>visible</b> and invisible <b>export</b> receipts are relatively more elastic than import expenditures. The nature of Greece's trade dependence is further explained by the monocultural character of the economy and the fact that Greece is a small buyer and seller in world trade. Post-war foreign aid has contributed little in moderating this monocultural economy. Furthermore, World War II has created some unfavorable conditions for Greek trade. As the balance of payments is a limiting factor {{on the size of the}} investment program, high trade dependence seriously restricts the prospects for economic development, and the population factor assumes paramount importance. Further evidence of the persistent imbalance between resources and population is offered in Chapter IV. The Greek economy is investigated during the period of free migrations and trade (1828 - 1920). The population of Greece increased from 753, 000 to 5, 017, 000. About two-thirds of the increase came from territorial acquisitions. Excess birth rates and some net immigration account for the remainder. Economic conditions in the domestic economy remained practically stagnant. Limited land, a feudal-like land tenure, primitive methods in production, and lack of capital restricted employment opportunities in agriculture. Manufacturing was largely a household operation. Foreign capital, borrowed by the government on heavy terms, was mostly spent on unproductive undertakings and led the country into default. Close correlation was found between the increase in population and imports. Percentwise, <b>visible</b> <b>exports</b> declined, while emigrant remittances and shipping earnings rose in importance. Migratory movements were almost continuous, especially with Greeks settled along the Anatolian littoral. Extensive emigration, especially overseas, at the turn of the century was more than offset by repatriation and the influx of refugees, even before the compulsory exchange of minorities in the Balkans. It is most likely that the scale of living did not improve after the third default of the country in the 1890 's. This likelihood, together with the extensive overseas emigration, strongly suggests that conditions of demographic equilibrium were not established. The 1920 's witnessed a mass in-migration of refugees and the first inter-war attempt toward economic adjustment. This is the subject of Chapter V. Population increased qy about 1, 450, 000 to approximately 6, 472, 000 in 1931. About 300 million 1947 - 49 U. S. dollars of foreign capital entered the country. Yet, this reconstruction scheme was not successful. The refugee settlement, the agrarian reform, and rising excess birth rates resulted in uneconomic parcelation of the land and small-scale subsistence farming. Extensive cultivation accounts for the largest part of the increase in agricultural production. The growing imbalance between capital-resources and population is evidenced by the increase in labor-absorbing lines of farm production. Despite progress, manufacturing fell short of taking care of the large urban underemployment. Furthermore, manufacturing exports comprised a very small fraction of total commodity exports. A balanced budget, a stabilized currency, and a restored monetary and credit mechanism were an economic bonanza. The depression of the 1930 's put an early end to this first scheme. Greece fell into default again. Per capita real income never reached pre-World War I levels during the 1920 's. Even with milder or no cyclical effects at all, it is problematic whether the Greek economy would be able to export an adequate surplus to meet foreign loan obligations, much less maintain a rising scale of living. Chapter VI deals with the policy for economic autarchy of the 1930 's, which constitutes the second inter-war attempt toward economic adjustment. Total gross investments, mostly forced savings through bootstrap-like operations, are estimated at between 600 and 700 million 1947 - 49 dollars. Agriculture proper received first and most attention. The weighted index of agricultural production, 1928 : 100, averaged 211 in 1937 - 38. Despite the drive for intensive production, extensive cultivation accounts for most of the increase in output. The animal-vegetable ratio showed marked signs of declining. The gains in greater output were largely the result of high tariffs. An increase in industrial production was not followed by a corresponding increase in employment. During the 1930 's population increased by about 950, 000 to 7, 345, 000 in 1940 because of high excess births. Measurements estimate that Greece had a 1, 424, 000 "surplus" agricultural population. Most likely, per capita income did not reach pre-World War II levels. Deterioration of nutritional standards through a fall in the animal-vegetable ratio at the consumption level and inferior manufactured goods domestically produced behind high tariffs most probably have taken place. International accounts were balanced and employment opportunities increased, but the policy for economic autarchy fell short of establishing conditions of demographic equilibrium. The subject of Chapter VII concerns the third attempt toward economic adjustment through post-war foreign aid. Widespread destruction, guerrilla warfare, and political instability delayed economic recovery. Finally, by 1952 economic conditions were improved, and the first post-war stable government came into power. However, prospects for maintaining conditions of demographic equilibrium are not encouraging. From over 2 billion dollars of foreign aid, only about 450 raillion were invested in long-run developmental projects. The drastic cut in foreign aid for 1953 - 54 and the limited availability of capital from domestic and foreign sources emphasize again the importance of population. In the past, continuous population increase has underscored and aggravated the economic difficulties of Greece. Post-war vital statistics indicate that the population of Greece is increasing rapidly, from 10 to 12 per thousand annual rate on the 1951 population census of 7, 631, 000. Fertility decline depends on the slow process of demographic transition. Emigration on an adequate scale is neither easily attainable nor acceptable on general grounds. At the same time, a higher scale of living is not only socially desirable but regarded as a matter of social justice. The ensuing relative deprivation may result in widely spread social unrest with corresponding political and ideological implications. In the final chapter (VIII) a summary of the findings is made, together with the following concluding remarks: The present rate of resources utilization may prove to be inadequate to support the rapidly increasing post-war population at a rising scale of living. Even prospects brighter than those of the present with respect to availability of capital and the renewal of foreign aid for the continuation of the development program, or to the integration of Greece into a European economy do not justify the absence of attempts on the part of the government to control future population growth...|$|R
