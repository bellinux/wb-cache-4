5|$|The {{chemotherapy}} regimen {{depends on}} the tumor type. Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), even relatively early stage disease, is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation. In SCLC, cisplatin and etoposide are most commonly used. Combinations with carboplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, <b>vinorelbine,</b> topotecan, and irinotecan are also used. In advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided the person is well enough for the treatment. Typically, two drugs are used, of which one is often platinum-based (either cisplatin or carboplatin). Other commonly used drugs are gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetrexed, etoposide or <b>vinorelbine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} {{refers to}} the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome. In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby lymph nodes during surgery to assist staging. If stage II or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival by 5% at five years. The combination of <b>vinorelbine</b> and cisplatin is more effective than older regimens. Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. Chemotherapy before surgery in NSCLC that can be removed surgically also appears to improve outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Vinca {{alkaloids}} {{are derived}} from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus (formerly known as Vinca rosea). They bind to specific sites on tubulin, inhibiting the assembly of tubulin into microtubules. The original vinca alkaloids are natural products that include vincristine and vinblastine. Following {{the success of these}} drugs, semi-synthetic vinca alkaloids were produced: <b>vinorelbine</b> (used in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer), vindesine, and vinflunine. These drugs are cell cycle-specific. They bind to the tubulin molecules in S-phase and prevent proper microtubule formation required for M-phase.|$|E

50|$|Cisplatin in {{combination}} with raltitrexed has shown an improvement in survival similar to that reported for pemetrexed {{in combination}} with cisplatin, but raltitrexed is no longer commercially available for this indication.

For patients in whom cisplatin cannot be used, carboplatin can be substituted but non-randomised data have shown lower response rates and high rates of haematological toxicity for carboplatin-based combinations, albeit with similar survival figures to patients receiving cisplatin.|$|E

50|$|Vincaminol (C20H26N2O2) is a {{chemical}} {{that is a}} part of the Vinca alkaloid group, which were discovered in the 1950s by a Canadian scientist and are derived from Vinca minor (periwinkle). Vincaminol is not as well known as some of the other Vinca alkaloids such as vinblastine, <b>vinorelbine,</b> vincristine, and vindesine, which are the four main, medically useful Vinca alkaloids.|$|E
5000|$|Vinblastine and vincristine, {{chemotherapy}} medications used {{to treat}} several types of cancers, {{are found in the}} plant and are biosynthesised from the coupling of the alkaloids catharanthine and vindoline. [...] The newer semi-synthetic chemotherapeutic agent <b>vinorelbine,</b> used in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, can be prepared either from vindoline and catharanthine or from the vinca alkaloid leurosine, in both cases via anhydrovinblastine.|$|E
50|$|Vinblastine is {{a highly}} potent drug which also has serious side effects {{especially}} on the neurological system. Therefore, new synthetic analogues were developed {{with the goal of}} obtaining more efficient and less toxic drugs. The stereochemical configurations at C-20', C-16' and C-14' in the velbanamine portion are critical and inversion leads to loss of activity. The C-16' carboxymethyl group is important for activity since decarboxylated dimer is inactive. Structural variation at C-15'- C-20' in the velbanamine ring is well tolerated. The upper skeletal modification of vinblastine gave <b>vinorelbine</b> which shows comparable activity as that of vinblastine. Another analogue prepared was the difluoro derivative of <b>vinorelbine</b> which showed improved in vivo antitumor activity. It was discovered that fluorination at C-19' position of <b>vinorelbine</b> dramatically increased the in vivo activity. Most of the SAR studies involve the vindoline portion of bis-indole alkaloids because modification at C-16 and C-17 offers good opportunities for developing new analogues. The replacement of the ester group with an amide group at the C-16 resulted in the development of vindesine. Similarly replacement of the acetyl group at C-16 with L-trp-OC2H5, d-Ala(P)-(OC2H5)2, L-Ala(P)-(OC2H5)2 and I-Vla(P)-(OC2H5)2 gave rise to new analogues having anti- tubulin activity. Also {{it was found that the}} vindoline's indole methyl group is a useful position to functionalize potentially and develop new, potent vinblastine derivatives. A new series of semi-synthetic C-16 -spiro-oxazolidine-1,3-diones prepared from 17-deacetyl vinblastine showed good anti-tubulin activity and lower cytotoxicity. Vinglycinate a glycinate prodrug derived from the C-17-OH group of vinblastine showed similar antitumor activity and toxicity as that of vinblastine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vinorelbine</b> was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in the United States in 1994.

The wholesale price in the developing world as of 2014 is between 18.10 and 42.82 USD per 50 mg vial. This amount in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about 139.00 pounds.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} dimeric {{alkaloids}} formed from two distinct monomers, {{such as the}} vinca alkaloids vinblastine and vincristine, which are formed from the coupling of catharanthine and vindoline. [...] The newer semi-synthetic chemotherapeutic agent <b>vinorelbine</b> {{is used in the}} treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer.

5000|$|Vinflunine {{is a novel}} {{fluorinated}} vinca alkaloid {{currently in}} Phase II clinical trials, which in preclinical studies exhibited superior antitumor activity to <b>vinorelbine</b> and vinblastine. Vinflunine block mitosis at the metaphase/anaphase transition, leading to apoptosis. Vinflunine is a chemotherapy drug used to treat advanced transitional cell bladder and urothelial tract cancer. It is also called Javlor. It is licensed {{for people who have}} already had cisplatin or carboplatin chemotherapy.|$|E
50|$|A phase III {{clinical}} trial {{was carried out}} on 493 histology or cytology-confirmed stage IIIB and IV NSCLC patients with a life expectancy >3 months.

The addition of Endostar to the standard chemotherapeutic regimen in these advanced NSCLC patients resulted in significant and clinically meaningful improvement in response rate, median time to progression, and clinical benefit rate compared with the chemotherapeutic regimen alone.|$|E

5000|$|Health: Several {{critical}} metals or minerals are toxic or reprotoxic.

Thus, toxic and cancer-causing platinum is also widely used in cancer chemotherapy in the form of carboplatin and cisplatin, both cytotoxins combined with other molecules, including for example gemcitabine (GEM), <b>vinorelbine</b> (VIN), docetaxel (DOC) and paclitaxel (PAC).|$|E
50|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} {{refers to}} the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome.

50|$|Also in 2004, Harran and {{co-workers}} reported a dimeric small molecule that mimics the proapoptotic protein Smac (see mitochondrial regulation in apoptosis). This molecule mimics the N-terminal linear motif Ala-Val-Pro-Ile. Uniquely, the dimeric structure of this peptidomimetic {{led to a}} marked increase in activity over an analogous monomer. This binding cooperativity results from the molecule's ability to also mimic the homodimeric structure of Smac, which is functionally important for reactivating caspases. Smac mimetics of this type can sensitize an array of non-small-cell lung cancer cells to conventional chemotherapeutics (e.g. Gemcitabine, <b>Vinorelbine)</b> both in vitro and in mouse xenograft models.|$|E
