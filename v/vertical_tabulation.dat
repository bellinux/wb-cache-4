50|$|Many {{printers}} supported ASA {{carriage control}} characters which provided a limited {{degree of control}} over the paper, by specifying how far to advance the paper between printed lines. Various means of providing <b>vertical</b> <b>tabulation</b> were provided, ranging from a paper carriage control tape loop to fully electronic (software-controllable) tab simulation.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the control}} codes area (the C0 range), the Spectrum mostly uses {{proprietary}} controls, such as INK and PAPER to control foreground and background colour. However, the common [...] and [...] code points {{are the same}} as in ASCII. Cursor-down (0x0A, ASCII Line Feed) can be simulated with 32 spaces printed with OVER 1 (transparent overprint) and cursor-up 0x0B (ASCII <b>Vertical</b> <b>Tabulation)</b> can be simulated with 32 backspaces. The system ROM has a fault which prevents cursor-right at 0x09 (c.f. ASCII Horizontal Tabulation) from working.|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} report is given of exact (numerical) solutions of the laminar-boundary-layer equations for the Prandtl number range appropriate to liquid metals (0. 003 to 0. 03). Consideration {{is given to}} the following situations: (1) forced convection over a flat plate for the conditions of uniform wall temperature and uniform wall heat flux, and (2) free convection over an isothermal <b>vertical</b> plate. <b>Tabulations</b> of the new solutions are given in detail. Results are presented for the heat-transfer and shear-stress characteristics; temperature and velocity distributions are also shown. The heat-transfer results are correlated in terms of dimensionless parameters that vary only slightly over the entire liquid-metal range. Previous analytical and experimental work on low Prandtl number boundary layers is surveyed and compared with the new exact solutions...|$|R
50|$|The {{intention}} {{was to have the}} printers be programmed with control characters to set and clear the stops: ISO 6429 includes the codes 136 (Horizontal Tabulation Set), 137 (Horizontal Tabulation with Justification) and 138 (<b>Vertical</b> <b>Tabulation</b> Set). In practice, settable tab stops were rather quickly replaced with fixed tab stops, de facto standardized at every multiple of 8 characters horizontally, and every 6 lines vertically. A printing program could send zero or more tabs to get to the closest tab stop above and left of where it wanted to print, then send line feeds and spaces to get to the final location. Tab characters simply became a form of data compression.|$|E
