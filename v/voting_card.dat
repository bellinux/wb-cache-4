25|$|Taylor {{had been}} outspoken in his {{opposition}} to the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) and other trade agreements that he argues would hurt his district, which has suffered from the closing of textile, furniture, and other plants when production has been moved abroad where labor costs are cheaper. However, he failed to register a vote during final approval of the agreement by the House, which passed 217–215. According to GOP aides, Taylor cast a no vote with a deactivated <b>voting</b> <b>card.</b> The glitch registered with the House Clerk's office, but Taylor had left the House floor and aides said attempts to locate him during the 62-minute vote were unsuccessful.|$|E
60|$|We {{trip over}} these trivial repetitions and exactitudes at every turn, only {{they are too}} trivial even for conversation. A man named Williams did walk into a strange house and murder a man named Williamson; {{it sounds like a}} sort of infanticide. A {{journalist}} of my acquaintance did move quite unconsciously from a place called Overstrand to a place called Overroads. When he had made this escape he was very properly pursued by a <b>voting</b> <b>card</b> from Battersea, on which a political agent named Burn asked him to vote for a political candidate named Burns. And when he did so another coincidence happened to him: rather a spiritual than a material coincidence; a mystical thing, a matter of a magic number.|$|E

50|$|The {{election}} was marred with irregularities. The principle of secrecy of vote was not respected. In many cases local chiefs {{were in charge}} of distributing <b>voting</b> <b>cards,</b> chiefs who simultaneously were campaigning for Barry Diawadou (the electoral law demanded that local committees be formed with representatives of all parties for the sake of distributing <b>voting</b> <b>cards).</b> On many occasions, the ballot for Barry Diawadou was attached to the <b>voting</b> <b>cards.</b> At the <b>voting</b> stations, PDG representatives were chased away or physically abused in many locations. With the PDG representatives gone, the fraud could go on without limitations. The irregularities were most widespread in Futa Jalon, the stronghold of Barry Diawadou.|$|R

In addition, when as players passed his/her home state space, he/she earns a <b>vote</b> <b>card</b> while landing exactly on the space earns two cards (similar to passing [...] "Go" [...] in Monopoly). If an opposing player lands on another's home state space, he has to allow that player to blindly steal one of his <b>vote</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mexico has {{a general}} electoral census. Any citizen of age 18 or greater {{must go to}} an electoral office in order be {{registered}} into the electoral census. Citizens receive a <b>voting</b> <b>card</b> (credencial de elector con fotografía), issued by the National Electoral Institute (INE) (from 1990 until 4/2014 it was called Federal Electoral Institute) that must be shown to vote in any election. The <b>voting</b> <b>card</b> {{also serves as a}} national identity document.|$|E
50|$|Voting in Belgium {{is done by}} paper voting or {{electronic}} voting on a computer {{depending on the place}} of voting. A few weeks before the actual election, every Belgian older than 18 receives a <b>voting</b> <b>card</b> with the details of where and when to vote. The voting cards are sent by the municipal administration to all of the municipality's inhabitants based on the national population register. Voting bureaus are usually in schools. On polling day, always a Sunday, a volunteer at the voting bureau checks the voter in. After taking the voter's electronic identity card and <b>voting</b> <b>card,</b> the volunteer issues a magnetic card to operate the voting machine. After the voter has finished, the volunteer verifies that the magnetic card was used to cast a valid vote, then returns the voter's ID and <b>voting</b> <b>card,</b> now stamped as proof of having voted.|$|E
50|$|The term InterHash {{specifically}} {{refers to}} the World InterHash. Attendees vote for bidding Hash kennels to choose where the succeeding InterHash will be held. It is an Olympic-style election where voters have to rank each candidate on their <b>voting</b> <b>card.</b> During the ballot counting {{at the end of}} each round the votes initially allocated to the bidder with the lowest score are redistributed according to the second preference marked on the <b>voting</b> <b>card</b> and so on. The winner is declared once a bidder has gathered more than 50% of the votes overall.|$|E

25|$|After being {{informed}} that <b>voting</b> <b>cards</b> were being {{sold in the}} capital, Kabul, an Afghan working for the BBC posed as a potential buyer and was offered one thousand <b>voting</b> <b>cards</b> on the spot, for $10 (£6) per card. Samples provided were all authentic with the name, photo and home details of the voter on them. Other parties also offered to sell the BBC investigators thousands of votes, and some sellers have even been arrested by the authorities.|$|R
2500|$|A flourishing {{black market}} in voter {{registration}} cards has also sprung {{up across the}} south of Afghanistan where they were being sold for £6 to £18 each. The Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan (FEFA), an independent election monitoring organisation, had also collected evidence of election fraud, particularly in the voter registration process. The monitoring group found that in many places people were being issued multiple <b>voting</b> <b>cards,</b> that <b>voting</b> <b>cards</b> were often issued for children, and that stacks of <b>voting</b> <b>cards</b> were given to men who falsely claimed that they were for women in their households. Long lists of imaginary female relatives {{were found to have}} been concocted during an attempt to update the electoral roll. In Kandahar, [...] "Britney Jamilia Spears" [...] appeared among the names registered. FEFA found that multiple registrations of a single person were taking place in at least 40% of all centers in one phase of the registration drive, and in one case, investigators found that about 500 <b>voting</b> registration <b>cards</b> were given to just one individual in Badghis province.|$|R

50|$|Junta {{cards are}} drawn and El Presidente is elected, if necessary. Each player's {{vote in the}} Chamber of Deputies as well as {{influence}} and <b>vote</b> <b>cards</b> are used. An errata later clarified that if a player declines a nomination votes may be recast {{with the exception of}} <b>vote</b> <b>cards</b> which are discarded. El Presidente retains his or her position until the event of assassination, a successful coup, or resignation. All three events have the effect of liquidating the President's assets and delivering his cash to his assassin or successor.|$|R

50|$|Although the CURP is the de jure {{official}} identification document in Mexico, the Instituto Nacional Electoral's <b>voting</b> <b>card</b> is {{the de facto}} {{official identification}} and proof of legal age for citizens of ages 18 and older.|$|E
50|$|Most adults {{need the}} CURP code too, {{since it is}} {{required}} for almost all governmental paperwork like tax filings and passport applications. Most companies ask for a prospective employee's CURP, <b>voting</b> <b>card,</b> or passport rather than birth certificates.|$|E
50|$|A <b>voting</b> <b>card</b> {{is sent to}} each {{registrant}} {{shortly before}} any elections. The individual {{does not need to}} take the card to the polling station, instead it serves to remind individuals of the details they had provided to the electoral register.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, {{the court}} heard a {{petition}} concerning the election held on 13 June 1998 {{of a member}} of parliament for the Electoral district of Mansfield. The petitioner was the former sitting member representing the Liberals whilst the Labor candidate was declared elected. The petition alleged that a how to <b>vote</b> <b>card</b> was handed out by Labor party workers to voters for the One Nation Party (ONP), which directed second preferences to Labor. The how to <b>vote</b> <b>card</b> was a Labor authorised card rather than an ONP authorised card. In the circumstances of the dispute, the court dismissed the petition.|$|R
5000|$|Each player not {{in exile}} {{has the ability}} to draw and play [...] "Junta" [...] <b>cards,</b> direct the <b>votes</b> he {{controls}} via cabinet positions, influence, and <b>vote</b> <b>cards</b> on the President and the budget votes, carry out the abilities listed on his influence cards and cabinet positions, command his troops during a coup, and manage his money. In all votes, each player commands one vote representing himself and whatever votes he can garner from influence or <b>voting</b> <b>cards.</b> The only exception is the Presidential election after a successful coup in which each rebel player commands one and only one vote.|$|R
50|$|Dublin City Council apologised {{after using}} an {{out-of-date}} electoral register file to generate polling information cards; {{this resulted in}} 35,000 voters and deceased people receiving incorrect information about where to <b>vote.</b> <b>Cards</b> were regenerated using the correct data.|$|R
50|$|Although {{primarily}} {{intended to}} substitute {{for a series of}} registration numbers (IMSS, RFC, IFE), the CURP has failed to replace any of these, which continue to use their own code-generation protocols. Nevertheless, the IFE <b>voting</b> <b>card</b> now contains both the IFE code and the CURP code.|$|E
50|$|The 2010 presidential {{elections}} were criticized by opposition leaders and independent observers for various missteps in democratic practice. Reported issues included the inappropriate influence of traditional leaders, ballot and <b>voting</b> <b>card</b> shortages at polling stations, inaccurate electoral lists and a misappropriation of resources {{by the state}} for Compaore's re-election campaign.|$|E
5000|$|The votes {{executed}} {{are called}} [...] "Proxy Votes" [...] because the shareholder usually does {{not attend the}} meeting and instead sends instructions - a proxy appointment - for a third party, usually {{the chairman of the}} meeting to vote shares in accordance with the instructions given on the <b>voting</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E
