5|$|President Barack Obama set {{the goal}} of {{bringing}} 1 million plug-in electric <b>vehicles</b> <b>on</b> the road by 2015. However, considering the actual slow rate of PEV sales, as of mid-2012 several industry observers have concluded that this goal is unattainable. In September 2014 Governor of California Jerry Brown signed a bill, the Charge Ahead California Initiative, that sets a goal of placing at least 1 million zero-emission vehicles and near-zero-emission <b>vehicles</b> <b>on</b> the road in California by January 1, 2023.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995, the City Council {{voted to}} remove parking from {{the grounds of}} City Hall. Previously, the {{landscaped}} yard surrounding the building had been paved to allow the city council members to park their <b>vehicles</b> <b>on</b> site. That month also marked the 100th birthday of the structure.|$|E
5|$|The Golden Age of Trucking Museum {{featured}} {{a collection of}} historic trucks, cars and other items related to the trucking operation, with a special focus on trucking in the 1950s. Many of the historic <b>vehicles</b> <b>on</b> display were noted for their rarity or otherwise unique quality. These include the first registered car in Connecticut, a 1902 Merry Oldsmobile, and a 1928 Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company five-to-seven ton dump truck, one of only 55 Pierce-Arrow trucks produced. The displays included a 1916 Mack Paddy Wagon, a 1929 Diamond T truck, a 1931 Ford Model AA Service Car, a 1936 Ford Roadster Deluxe and a Model T Ford Tank Truck. A 1953 Fageol moving van with original owner's banner was located near some surreys and carriages. Other early period <b>vehicles</b> <b>on</b> display included a 1912 Autocar two-cylinder transit bus, a 1914 Trumbull, a 1915 Barker, and a 1917 Republic Model 10 1-ton express and a 1920 3 ½ ton Model AC Mack.|$|E
50|$|In Taiwan (administered by the Republic of China), when {{at least}} two {{vehicles}} reach a T intersection without a working traffic light, the <b>vehicle</b> <b>on</b> the side road is to yield to any other <b>vehicle</b> straight <b>on</b> the main road.

5|$|A {{total of}} 1,486,929,267 {{vehicles}} {{have used the}} crossing as of 31 March 2014. The highest recorded daily usage was 181,990 <b>vehicles</b> <b>on</b> 23 July 2004; since then traffic levels have decreased. From April 2013 to March 2014, 49,645,356 vehicles used the crossing: a daily average of 136,015 vehicles. The total income for the financial year ended 31 March 2012 was £72,147,091, while the corresponding figure for the following financial year was £80,331,662. A 2016 report by Highways England suggested the crossing is used around 50 million times a year.|$|E
5|$|As of 2009, {{the most}} heavily trafficked {{segments}} of NY31 lie {{in and around the}} city of Rochester. The busiest of these, from Interstate590 (I-590) to NY65 in the eastern suburb of Brighton, carries in excess of 40,000 vehicles per day on average. Two other segments—between South and Woodbury Avenues in downtown Rochester and from NY65 to French Road in Brighton and Pittsford—have traffic volumes in excess of 30,000 <b>vehicles.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, the portion of NY31 in the Oneida County town of Vernon between the Vernon Downs racetrack and Youngs Road handles just 910 cars per day on average, making it the least-traveled segment of the route.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} state's {{maintenance}} of M-117, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadway. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of <b>vehicles</b> <b>on</b> a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that between 1,392and 1,986vehicles used the highway per day.|$|E

5|$|Hoping {{to attract}} a {{proposed}} ZAP electric vehicle manufacturing plant {{to the city of}} Franklin, Kentucky, Beshear issued an executive order permitting low-speed <b>vehicles</b> <b>on</b> many Kentucky roads in August 2008. The state also offered the company $48 million in tax incentives, contingent upon its delivering a promised 4,000 jobs. Construction of the proposed plant stalled, however, when GE Capital, a primary investor, pulled out of the project. ZAP officials maintained their intention to build the plant, but said they would also consider other states' proposals if they could not replace the $125 million commitment from GE.|$|E
5|$|In June 1981, new once-weekly routes linking Horsham to Steyning and Cranleigh/Ewhurst to Brighton were introduced, {{the second}} to replace a {{withdrawn}} Southdown Motor Services service. To improve profits on the Brighton route, beer was carried from the Sussex Brewery near Edburton to public houses along the route alongside passengers. The scheduled service operations of coach firm McCann's were acquired, together with three <b>vehicles,</b> <b>on</b> 1 November 1982, although some were withdrawn a year later.|$|E
5|$|M-137 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of <b>vehicles</b> <b>on</b> a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that 4,868vehicles used the highway daily. No section of M-137 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|M-34 is an east–west state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the southeastern region of the US state of Michigan. It has a western terminus near Osseo on M-99 and runs through forest and farm lands to its eastern terminus at Business US Highway 223 (BUS US223) and M-52 in Adrian. The highway serves a number of smaller communities {{in the area and}} intersects two US Highways while carrying between 4,200 and 11,300 <b>vehicles</b> <b>on</b> a daily basis.|$|E
5|$|M-80 has {{not been}} listed on the National Highway System (NHS) by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). The NHS is a network of {{highways}} important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. MDOT's annual surveys of the traffic counts are used to compute a value called the annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a measurement {{of the number of}} <b>vehicles</b> <b>on</b> a road for any given day of the year. The survey from 2009 showed that 2,803vehicles used the western section between I-75 and Gaines Highway, with 61trucks included in the count. The eastern section was used by 1,657vehicles and 61trucks.|$|E
5|$|Seattle Transit {{general manager}} Lloyd Garber said that demand for parking {{was higher than}} {{expected}} {{and that it was}} too early to analyze ridership; after the first week of service, Seattle Transit began surveying riders to determine whether motorists had been lured by the new service. The study determined that 75 percent of surveyed patrons had switched from their personal automobiles, and that Blue Streak was responsible for a decrease of 400 <b>vehicles</b> <b>on</b> Interstate 5 at rush hour. By late October, demand at the Northgate park and ride prompted the State Highway Department to offer funding for an auxiliary lot.|$|E

5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks traffic volumes {{along the}} roads it maintains. These volumes are {{expressed}} {{as the average}} annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measurement {{of the number of}} <b>vehicles</b> <b>on</b> a stretch of roadway for any average day of the year. For the 2008 survey, traffic volume was 3,604vehicles per day, with 437commercial vehicles in the tally. In 2009, the numbers increased to 8,252vehicles total and 1287commercial vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Ploče is {{the second}} largest cargo seaport in Croatia, mostly serving Bosnia and Herzegovina, along with some local and {{regional}} users. The port {{is administered by the}} Port of Ploče Authority, with Luka Ploče d.d. as the primary concessionaire. Subcontractors that operate the liquid cargo terminal facilities are Naftni Terminali Federacije d.o.o. and Luka Ploče Trgovina d.o.o., while passenger and vehicle transit is handled by Jadrolinija. Jadrolinija ferries sail between Ploče and Trpanj on the Pelješac peninsula and the D415 state road. In 2009, the ferry line carried annual average daily traffic of 143 vehicles. During summer the volume increased to 383 <b>vehicles</b> <b>on</b> average.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{meetings}} involving Wooten, Barbey, Edmund Herring (Wooten's superior as commander of I Corps), Colonel Merian C. Cooper from the Fifth Air Force, and Air Commodore Joe Hewitt from the RAAF, reached agreement, or at least compromise, on many points. Wooten wanted at least 10 days' reserve rations. This meant that some stores {{would have to be}} transported in bulk, and not pre-loaded on trucks as Barbey initially wanted. Loading the stores onto trucks was an inefficient use of shipping space, but permitted quick unloading of the LSTs, as the trucks could simply be driven off. The 9th Division did not have sufficient trucks for this, but 200 trucks earmarked for the US Advanced Base at Lae were borrowed from USASOS. Barbey would not allow loaded <b>vehicles</b> <b>on</b> the tank decks of the LSTs, as this was a fire hazard, so bulk stores were carried there instead.|$|E
