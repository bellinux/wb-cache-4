40|$|Rabies {{control in}} {{terrestrial}} wildlife reservoirs {{relies heavily on}} an oral rabies vaccine (ORV). In addition to direct ORV delivery to protect wildlife in natural habitats, vaccine corridors have been constructed to control the spread; these corridors are often developed around natural barriers, such as rivers, to enhance the effectiveness of vaccine deployment. However, {{the question of how}} to optimally deploy ORV around a river (or other natural barrier) to best exploit the barrier for rabies control has not been addressed using mathematical models. Given an advancing epidemic wave, should the vaccine be distributed on both sides of barrier, behind the barrier, or in front of it? Here, we introduce a new mathematical model for the dynamics of raccoon rabies on a spatially heterogeneous landscape that is both simple and realistic. We demonstrate that the vaccine should always be deployed behind a barrier to minimize the recurrence of subsequent epidemics. Although the oral rabies vaccine is sufficient to induce herd immunity inside the <b>vaccinated</b> <b>area,</b> it simultaneously creates a demographic refuge. When that refuge is in front of a natural barrier, seasonal dispersal from the vaccine corridor into an endemic region sustains epidemic oscillations of raccoon rabies. When the vaccine barrier creates a refuge behind the river, the low permeability of the barrier to host movement limits dispersal of the host population from the protected populations into the rabies endemic area and limits subsequent rabies epidemics...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to measure the transmissibility of Type A H 5 N 1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in mixed populations of backyard and small-scale commercial chickens in Java. An approach adapted from infection tree reconstruction was used to trace affected chickens and households in neighborhoods (RTs) in which HPAI had been diagnosed by Indonesia’s surveillance system. Of the 41 outbreaks studied, 15 were in RTs participating in a mass vaccination program. The study found that backyard chickens were free range, visiting a mean 4. 2 households. Commercial poultry were present within the village in nearly half of the outbreaks, although they were affected in only 7. 3 %. The distance from the index to the closest unaffected household was significantly greater than that from the index to the closest affected. Mean morbidity was 80. 9 ± 28. 8 %, mortality 77. 6 ± 27. 7 %, and case fatality 97. 3 ± 12. 3 %. There was significant risk for outbreaks to occur in households where Muscovy ducks, non-commercial chickens, broilers and geese were kept, but there was not a significant risk associated with keeping pigeons or ducks (Anatidae family not including Muscovy). Introduction of new birds to a household flock was most frequently documented to have led to the introduction of the disease to an RT, while contact between birds from different household flocks was most frequently documented to have contributed to spread. Transmission between birds within flocks was significantly higher than transmission between flocks, between birds within flocks in <b>vaccinated</b> <b>areas</b> was significantly lower than in unvaccinated areas, and between flocks in <b>vaccinated</b> <b>areas</b> was significantly lower than in unvaccinated areas.

40|$|Emergency {{vaccination}} is {{an effective}} control strategy for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemics in densely populated livestock areas, but results in a six-month waiting period before exports can be resumed, incurring severe economic consequences for pig exporting countries. In the European Union, a one-month waiting period has been discussed based on negative test results in a final screening. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the risk of exporting FMD-infected pig carcasses from a vaccinated area: (1) directly after final screening and (2) after a six-month waiting period. A risk model has been developed to estimate the probability that a processed carcass was derived from an FMD-infected pig (Pcarc). Key variables were herd prevalence (PH), within-herd prevalence (PA), and the probability of detection at slaughter (PSL). PH and PA were estimated using Bayesian inference under the assumption that, despite all negative test results, = 1 infected pigs were present. Model calculations indicated that Pcarc was on average 2. 0 × 10 - 5 directly after final screening, and 1. 7 × 10 - 5 after a six-month waiting period. Therefore, the additional waiting time did not substantially reduce Pcarc. The estimated values were worst-case scenarios because only viraemic pigs pose a risk for disease transmission, while seropositive pigs do not. The risk of exporting FMD via pig carcasses from a <b>vaccinated</b> <b>area</b> can further be reduced by heat treatment of pork and/or by excluding high-risk pork products from export...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractOral mass {{vaccination}} (OMV) {{is considered}} as an efficient strategy for controlling {{classical swine fever}} (CSF) in wild boar. After the completion of vaccination, the presence of antibodies in 6 – 12  month-old hunted wild boars was expected to reflect a recent CSF circulation. Nevertheless, antibodies could also correspond to the long-lasting of maternal antibodies. This paper relates an experience of surveillance which lasted 4  years {{after the completion of}} OMV in a formerly <b>vaccinated</b> <b>area,</b> in north-eastern France (2010 – 2014). First, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the serological data collected in 6 – 12  month-old hunted wild boars from 2010 up to 2013, using a spatial Bayesian model accounting for hunting data autocorrelation and heterogeneity. At the level of the whole area, seroprevalence in juvenile boars decreased from 28 % in 2010 – 2011 down to 1 % in 2012 – 2013, but remained locally high (above 5 %). The model revealed the existence of one particular seroprevalence hot-spot where a longitudinal survey of marked animals was conducted in 2013 – 2014, for deciphering the origin of antibodies. Eleven out of 107 captured piglets were seropositive when 3 – 4  months-old, but their antibody titres progressively decreased until 6 – 7  months of age. These results suggest piglets were carrying maternal antibodies, few of them carrying maternal antibodies lasting until the hunting season. Our study shows that OMV may generate confusion in the CSF surveillance several years after the completion of vaccination. We recommend using quantitative serological tools, hunting data modelling and capture approaches for better interpreting serological results after vaccination completion. Surveillance perspectives are further discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to vaccine efficacy studies, {{there is a}} pressing need to evaluate vaccine effectiveness {{in a way that}} takes into account the limitations of health care systems in certain settings. An attempt to reach this objective was exemplified by a vaccination campaign against serogroup C meningococci in the federal state of Santa Catarina, in Brazil. A polysaccharide vaccine against serogroup C meningococci was administered to all individuals between 6 months and 14 years of age in March, 1996, in the municipalities that had the highest incidence of meningococcal disease in the previous year. All cases of the disease due to this serogroup observed in Santa Catarina during a 1 -year period before and after the vaccination were included in the analysis. The cumulative incidence rate ratio was calculated for the unvaccinated compared to the <b>vaccinated</b> <b>area.</b> As a second step, the ratio of this quantity for the period before and after the vaccination, i. e. the ratio of the rate ratios (RRR), was calculated. One minus RRR was used to estimate the vaccine effectiveness. In the general population, the vaccine effectiveness was 74. 3 % (95 % confidence intervals 52. 7 % to 99. 6 %). In children 6 months to 14 years, vaccine effectiveness was 93. 1 % (85. 2 % to 100 %). Vaccine effectiveness could not be confirmed within more specific age bands, probably {{due to the lack of}} statistical power. It is concluded that group C meningococcal vaccine is effective in reducing the occurrence of meningococcal disease in children 6 months to 14 years of age, and that the ratio of rate ratios (RRR) in a useful method to evaluate vaccine effectiveness...|$|E

40|$|Oral {{vaccination}} as {{a method}} of rabies eradication in the field was first started in Switzerland in 1978 and after 1984 several other EU countries followed this practice. Due to oral vaccination some European countries are now rabies-free in terrestrial animals. In Slovenia, after the first experimental oral vaccination and study of vaccination models from 1988 - 1992, the spring-autumn campaigns have been carried out since 1995. The model of oral vaccination of wildlife requires 16 - 20 baits per km 2 in the vaccination area. The baits were distributed by plane. They were dispersed from a height of 300 - 500 m. The aeroplanes' paths were 1000 metres apart. In the vaccination campaigns two vaccines were used. Lysvulpen®, produced by the Bioveta company at the Czech Republic, was laid down in the southwestern part of the country, and Fuchsoral®, produced by the German company Impfstoffwerk Dessau-Tornau, was placed {{in the eastern part of}} Slovenia. A rapid decline of rabies was evidenced from 1995 to 1999, when the oral vaccination program in the whole territory using the aircraft baits distributing system was practiced. In 1999, only 6 rabies cases were laboratory-confirmed, whereas in 1995, 1089 rabies cases were documented. Of the 14 rabies cases detected in 1998, 12 were found as an island in a circle with a radius of 30 km in the centre of the <b>vaccinated</b> <b>area.</b> In 2000 and 2001, rabies incidence increased again, so it was decided to change the baits distribution system in the year 2001.

40|$|Cystic {{echinococcosis}} (CE) is {{an important}} zoonotic disease caused by the cestode parasite Echinococcus granulosus. It occurs {{in many parts of}} the world where pastoral activities predominate, including the Rio Negro province of Argentina. Although CE control activities have been undertaken in the western regions of Rio Negro for more than two decades, the disease continues to remain prevalent in both the human and livestock animal populations. Vaccination of animal intermediate hosts of CE with the EG 95 vaccine may provide a new opportunity to improve the effectiveness of CE control measures, although data are lacking about field application of the vaccine. Evaluate the impact of EG 95 vaccination in sheep on the transmission of Echinococcus granulosus in a field environment. Two trial sites were established in western Rio Negro province within indigenous communities. Vaccination of lambs born into one trial site was introduced and continued for 6 years. Prior to initiation of the trial, and at the end of the trial, the prevalence of CE in sheep was determined by necropsy. Weaned lambs received two injections of EG 95 vaccine, approximately one month apart, and a single booster injection one year later. Vaccination was not implemented at the second trial site. A total of 2725 animals were vaccinated in the first year. Animals from this cohort as well as age-matched sheep from the control area were evaluated by necropsy. Introduction of the vaccine led to a statistically significant in the number and size of hydatid cysts in comparison to the situation prior to the introduction of the vaccine, or compared to CE prevalence in the control area where the vaccine was not applied. The prevalence of infection in the <b>vaccinated</b> <b>area</b> was also significantly reduced by 62 % compared to the re-intervention level, being lower than the prevalence seen in the control area, although the difference from the control area after the intervention was not significant possibly due to limitations in the numbers of animals available for necropsy.

We conducted a post-vaccination campaign, household-level survey about knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding diarrhea and cholera in areas targeted and not targeted for cholera vaccination. Respondents in <b>vaccinated</b> <b>areas</b> {{were more likely to}} have received cholera education in the previous 6 months (33 % v. 9 %; p = 0. 04), to know signs and symptoms (64 % vs. 22 %; p = 0. 02) and treatment (96 % vs. 50 %; p = 0. 02) of cholera, and to be aware of cholera vaccine (48 % vs. 14 %; p = 0. 02).

Here we demonstrate the feasibility of aerial delivery of this live vaccine in bait form to an M. bovis-infected wild possum population, and subsequently assess vaccine uptake and field efficacy. Pre-trial studies indicated a resident possum population at very low density (5 baits available per possum. Blood sampling conducted two months later provided some evidence of vaccine uptake. A necropsy survey conducted one year later identified a lower prevalence of culture-confirmed M. bovis infection and/or gross TB lesions among adult possums in <b>vaccinated</b> <b>areas</b> (1. 1 % prevalence; 95 % CI, 0 - 3. 3 %, n = 92) than in unvaccinated areas (5. 6 %; 0. 7 - 10. 5 %, n = 89); P = 0. 098. Although not statistically different, the 81 % efficacy in protecting possums against natural infection calculated from these data is within the range of previous estimates of vaccine efficacy in trials where BCG vaccine was delivered manually. We conclude that, with further straightforward refinement to improve free-choice uptake, aerial delivery of oral BCG vaccine is likely to be effective in controlling TB in wild possums.

40|$|Despite a high {{coverage}} with measles vaccines {{in parts}} of West Africa, epidemics of measles occur with reduced severity in an increasing proportion of older {{children who have been}} vaccinated. We examined the effect of exposure to natural measles on immunity in vaccinated children. Our study was carried out in 1992 during an epidemic of measles in Niakhar, a rural area of Senegal with about 27 000 inhabitants who mostly live in compounds that include several households; within each household people live in different huts. Vaccine coverage in Niakhar was 81 % at the time of our study. We measured haemagglutinin-inhibiting antibody at exposure and twice thereafter (after 4 - 5 weeks and at 6 months) in 36 vaccinated and 87 unvaccinated children. The frequency of measles and subclinical measles - defined as a four-fold or greater rise in antibody titre without clinical signs or symptoms - was related to intensity of exposure according to whether the index case was in the same hut, household, or compound. Clinical measles occurred in 20 (56 %) of 36 unvaccinated children and in one (1 %) of 87 vaccinated children. Subclinical measles occurred in 39 (45 %) of 86 vaccinated who were exposed to measles and in four (25 %) of 16 unvaccinated children. The frequency was inversely related to pre-exposure antibody concentrations in subclinical cases increased on average by 45 -fold and remained raised for at least 6 months. Increased antibody titre after subclinical measles may be common in vaccinated children in West Africa where the intensity of exposure is high. As measles vaccination coverage increases, the circulation of wild measles will decrease, and vaccine-induced antibody is less likely to be boosted. Thus, new epidemics, albeit milder in form, may occur in <b>vaccinated</b> <b>areas</b> which should be recognised in campaigns to eradicate measles. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute, fever causing {{viral disease}} that affects {{domestic}} animals and humans. In Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), this pathology {{is not well}} documented. No epidemic of the RVF has not been reported but sera samples collected in six provinces surveyed from 2005 to 2006 revealed 14 % of apparent prevalence and, high apparent prevalence (20 %) of antibodies against RVF virus was reported in Katanga Province during the same survey; this serological evidence was associated with abortions cases in Cattle (Mulumba et al. 2009). Livestock immunisation is important for control of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) epidemics; however immunisation of susceptible domestic animals in endemic countries does not protect animals against the clinical disease but prevents the propagation of virus to human population through reduction of the amplification degree in host animals. The humoral immunity is sufficient for protection for animals {{as well as for}} humans. The infection caused by RVFV leads to neutralisation of the immunity of the animal (Barnard 1979). Various immunological studies have been made on the characterisation of immune response during RVFV epidemics but, until now several studies have been concentrated on the response of the innate immune particularly based on signal interferon system than the response of the adaptive immune and cell mediated humoral immune. The available information on the immune response related to RVFV does not seem to provide enough information on various mechanisms of the response immune system. The aim of the study is based on mechanism of immune response system including protective effect of immunisation against RVFV. In addition, epidemiological and molecular studies will be assessed. As a matter of fact, following studies will be conducted: •	 evaluation of the immunological protection against Rift Valley fever in vaccinated and non- vaccinated cattle using IgG and IgM ELISAs in Katanga Province •	 assessment of cellular response to Rift Valley fever disease in vaccinated and naturally infected cattle •	 molecular characterisation of RVFV strains circulating in vaccinated and non vaccinated cattle •	 assessment of protective effect related to vaccinal strains in cattle, using a longitudinal survey. The studies will be carried out Northern Katanga Province within two areas, one with historyof circulation of RVFV and other without history RVFV circulation. Whole blood, spleen, liver, lymph node will be collected as target tissues from cattle carcasses. In addition, goats and sheeps samples will be collected alongside from each area in order to clarify the disease situation. Serological tests based on the detection of Ig M and Ig G will be used. DIVA tests, LAMP, and IHC techniques will be used.

40|$|ABSTRACT In three {{separate}} experiments, an avirulent Pasteurella multocida vaccine {{was administered to}} separate groups of turkeys by the following routes: ocular (conjunctival sac), nostril, palatine cleft, oral, drinking water, cloacal, intradermal, feather follicle and wing web. All groups were challenged with a virulent P- 1059 P. multocida strain 2 to 5 weeks post vaccination. Under the conditions of these experiments, {{the results suggest that}} a favorable immunogenic response of some kind occurred in all groups except those vaccinated by the nostril and cloacal routes. In the latter two groups there was little or no evidence of a favorable response. Turkeys vaccinated by the stick-wing-web method exhibited an excellent immunogenic response, but a large cheesy mass at the site of vaccination would probably result in condemnation of the <b>vaccinated</b> wing <b>areas</b> of some turkeys at the time of slaughter. This method uses little vaccine, is accurate, easy and rapid and, presumably, may have an application in nations where edible food of any kind is a primary objective. In a fourth experiment, the virulent P- 1059 challenge strain mentioned above was used as the vaccinating agent and was administered to separate groups of turkeys by the same various routes mentioned in the foregoing. One hundred percent of the turkeys exposed by the feather follicle route were dead within 48 hours and 90 % to 100 % of the groups exposed by the ocular, palatine cleft, intradermal and stick-wing-web routes were dead by the fourth day. The lowest mortality during a given number of days was in the groups exposed by the nostril and cloacal routes. Under the conditions of the fourth experiment, the results suggest that the eye is a possible route of infection under natural conditions, and that scratches and puncture wounds to the skin and crushed feather follicles, when accompanied by virulent P. multocida containing material, may possibly serve as portals of entry...|$|R

In the present study, we expressed Sm-TSP- 2 at high yield and in soluble form in E. coli without the need for a solubility enhancing fusion partner. We also expressed in E. coli a chimera called Sm-TSP- 2 / 5 B, which consisted of Sm-TSP- 2 fused to the immunogenic 5 B region of the hookworm aspartic protease and vaccine antigen, Na-APR- 1. Sm-TSP- 2 formulated with alum/CpG showed significant reductions in adult worm and liver egg burdens in two separate murine schistosomiasis challenge studies. Sm-TSP- 2 / 5 B afforded significantly greater protection than Sm-TSP- 2 alone when both antigens were formulated with alum/CpG. The enhanced protection obtained with the chimeric fusion protein was associated with increased production of anti-Sm-TSP- 2 antibodies and IL- 4, IL- 10 and IFN-c from spleen cells of vaccinated animals. Sera from 666 individuals from Brazil who were infected with S. mansoni were screened for potentially deleterious IgE responses to Sm-TSP- 2. Anti-Sm-TSP- 2 IgE to this protein was not detected (also shown previously for Na-APR- 1), suggesting that the chimeric antigen Sm-TSP- 2 / 5 B could be used to safely and effectively <b>vaccinate</b> people in <b>areas</b> wher...|$|R
40|$|Background: Immunization {{coverage}} {{levels in}} Guatemala have {{increased over the}} last two decades, but national targets of ≥ 95 % have yet to be reached. To determine factors related to undervaccination, Guatemala’s National Immunization Program conducted a user-satisfaction survey of parents and guardians of children aged 0 – 5 years. Variables evaluated included parental immunization attitudes, preferences, and practices; the impact of immunization campaigns and marketing strategies; and factors inhibiting immunization. Methods: Based on administrative coverage levels and socio-demographic indicators in Guatemala’s 22 geographical departments, five were designated as low-coverage and five as high-coverage areas. Overall, 1194 parents and guardians of children aged 0 – 5 years were interviewed in these 10 departments. We compared indicators between low- and high-coverage areas and identified risk factors associated with undervaccination. Results: Of the 1593 children studied, 29 (1. 8 %) were determined to be unvaccinated, 458 (28. 8 %) undervaccinated, and 1106 (69. 4 %) fully <b>vaccinated.</b> In low-coverage <b>areas,</b> children of less educated (no education: RR = 1. 49, p = 0. 01; primary or less: 1. 39, p = 0. 009), older (aged> 39 years: RR = 1. 31, p = 0. 05), and single (RR = 1. 32, p = 0. 03) parents {{were more likely to have}} incomplete vaccination schedules. Similarly, factors associated with undervaccination in high-coverage areas included the caregiver’s lack of education (none: RR = 1. 72, p = 0. 0007; primary or less: RR = 1. 30, p = 0. 05) and single marital status (RR = 1. 36, p = 0. 03), as well as the child’s birth order (second: RR = 1. 68, p = 0. 003) ...|$|R
40|$|Contagious ecthyma {{is caused}} by the orf virus, {{a member of the family}} Poxviridae, genus Parapoxvirus. Morbidity in {{affected}} sheep flocks is approximately 100 %, while mortality varies between 1 % and 10 %. A live attenuated vaccine was produced by the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise ‘G. Caporale’. Quality control was performed in accordance with the European Pharmacopoeia. A wild virus strain was attenuated through serial passages on primary chicken embryo fibroblast tissue cultures. The virus suspension was treated according to standard procedures and freeze dried. The immunising dose was 1 ml containing 104, 5 TCID 50, administered intramuscularly. The safety of the vaccine was successfully tested by intramuscular inoculation of 20 susceptible sheep and 20 lambs with the routine dose, 10 times the immunising dose and two normal doses administered at seven-day intervals. The efficacy of the vaccine was tested using three groups of susceptible animals. The first group included 10 lambs and the second 10 adult sheep; the animals were immunised intramuscularly with 1 ml of the reconstituted vaccine. The third group, used as controls, included five sheep and five lambs. Serological reactivity was monitored by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The animals were challenged 30 days later with a pathogenic strain administered intradermally along the labial <b>area.</b> <b>Vaccinated</b> animals did not show any clinical signs of disease, whereas all the controls developed typical signs of contagious ecthyma. To confirm the efficacy of the vaccine, a field trial was conducted in four flocks affected by the disease. The trial showed that the vaccine was able to block the normal course of the disease and induce rapid recovery...|$|R
40|$|Background: There {{are large}} {{variations}} in vaccination coverage, not only {{between high and}} low-income countries but also across low income countries and within low income countries. The reasons behind these variations are only sketchily understood. In particular, the current understanding of demand for childhood vaccinations is limited. Due to inadequate vaccination coverage {{more than one million}} children die annually from vaccine preventable diseases. Objective: The study set out to examine demand for childhood vaccinations from an economic perspective: to identify caretakers` perceptions of potential costs and benefits of vaccinating a child, and to examine the association between these perceptions and caretakers` decision making for childhood vaccination. Furthermore the study seeks to identify variables associated with caretakers` perception of benefits of vaccinating a child. Methods: The study was cross sectional, used structured questionnaires and employed a two stage cluster sampling technique. Respondents were caretakers of children at the age 18 - 59 months, in total 635 respondents were included in the study. The study was conducted in two traditional authorities in Thyolo district, Malawi. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the variables of study. Logistic regression analyses (univariate and multivariate) were conducted to measure the association between predicted explanatory variables from economic theory and decision making for childhood vaccination, and {{to examine the relationship between}} predicted explanatory variables and perceived benefits. Results: 96. 1 percent of the respondents reported to fully have vaccinated their youngest child in the age 18 – 59 months for all routine EPI vaccinations. The large majority of caretakers scored the measured benefits of vaccinating a child to be high, while they to a large extent were divided in their perceptions of costs. A large share of caretakers had to travel substantial distances to vaccinate their children. Incorrect knowledge of vaccination schedule (OR = 2. 95 (CI 0. 97 – 8. 99) P= 0, 06), fear for severity of side effects (OR= 3. 8 (CI 0. 89 - 16. 17) P= 0. 07), distrust in information on vaccination (OR= 27. 55 (CI 5 - 149) P= 0, 00) and giving birth at home (OR= 2. 52 (CI = 1. 18 - 5. 39) P= 0. 02) were found to be determinants for vaccination default (not having fully vaccinated youngest eligible child for all EPI routine vaccinations) in the univariate analysis. Not any of these determinants remained significant in the multivariate regression analysis (p-value < 0. 05). Distrust in received information (OR= 27. 52 CI (6 – 131) P= 0. 00) and being aware of less than two side effects (OR= 2. 32 (CI 1. 15 - 4. 68) P= 0. 019) were found to be determinants for limited perceived benefits (scoring the preventive effect of vaccination as limited) in the multivariate analysis. Discussion and conclusion: The study documents and points to the possibility and necessity of achieving high vaccination coverage in areas where many caretakers need to travel long distances to reach vaccinations, and where a large number of caretakers perceive the traveling and waiting time as long. The study suggests that high level of trust in information and in vaccinators may be an essential explanatory factor; in the way that trust facilitates positive perceived benefits which again make caretakers seek childhood vaccinations even though there are considerable costs involved. The study, however, does not provide the final explanation for why caretakers in the study <b>area</b> <b>vaccinate</b> their children, and nevertheless for why caretakers vaccinate or do not vaccinate their children in other areas. More emphasis should be devoted to demand for childhood vaccinations, both in research and in policy making...|$|R
