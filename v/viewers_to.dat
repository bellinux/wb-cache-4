50|$|The three subgenres of Modern Allegorism include whimsical, inspirational/spiritual, and paradoxical. These subgenres {{describe}} the mechanism {{through which the}} artist conveys the message. Whimsical modern allegories use humor in a non-critical fashion <b>to</b> encourage the <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> question their own perspectives and behavior. Inspirational/spiritual modern allegories attempt <b>to</b> inspire the <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> believe in their own abilities and trust their innate gifts. Paradoxical modern allegories position common elements {{in ways that are}} contrary <b>to</b> the <b>viewer's</b> expectation in order <b>to</b> encourage the <b>viewer</b> <b>to</b> evaluate the commonplace and see their own preconceptions in a new light.|$|R

5|$|According to Jesse Stommel of Bright Lights Film Journal, {{the lack}} of {{explicit}} violence in the film forces <b>viewers</b> <b>to</b> question their own fascination with violence that they {{play a central role}} in imagining. Nonetheless—citing its feverish camera moves, repeated bursts of light, and auditory pandemonium—Stommel asserts that it involves the audience primarily on a sensory rather than an intellectual level.|$|E
5|$|Cloud Gate is {{described}} as a transformative, iconic work. It is similar to many of Kapoor's previous works in the themes and issues it addresses. While the sculpture's mirror effects are reminiscent of fun-house fairground mirrors, they also have a more serious intent; they help dematerialize this very large object, making it seem light and almost weightless. Cloud Gate is considered Kapoor's most ambitious use of complex mirrored form dynamics. Kapoor challenges his <b>viewers</b> <b>to</b> internalize his work through intellectual and theoretical exercise. By reflecting the sky, visiting and non-visiting pedestrians and surrounding architecture, Cloud Gate limits its <b>viewers</b> <b>to</b> partial comprehension at any time. The interaction with the viewer who moves to create his own vision gives it a spiritual dimension. The sculpture {{is described}} as a disembodied, luminous form, which is also how his earlier 1000 Names (197980) was described when it addressed the metaphysical and mystical.|$|E

5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth {{who is able to}} control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed <b>viewers</b> <b>to</b> be able to see themselves as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E
5|$|Anton Meyer is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC medical drama Holby City, played by actor George Irving. He {{appeared in the}} series from its first episode, broadcast on 12 January 1999, until series four, episode 46, broadcast on 20 August 2002. His role in the show is that of consultant cardiothoracic surgeon {{and head of the}} cardiothoracic surgery department at Holby General. Irving had considerable input in creating the character, who was initially envisioned by the series producers as an Iranian surgeon named Hussein. At Irving's suggestion, Meyer became Hungarian, an emigrant to Britain following the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Little of the backstory created for Meyer was ever revealed on-screen, as part of a deliberate bid to present the character as enigmatic, allowing <b>viewers</b> <b>to</b> project their own imagination onto him.|$|E
