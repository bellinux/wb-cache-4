In order to mimic a typical matrix composition, various salts of aluminum, manganese, copper, magnesium, sodium, and lead were used in microgram amounts. Changes in spectra and <b>vapor</b> <b>release</b> <b>rate,</b> along with aging of the tubes in the repetitive temperature cycles, were observed. Compared to the unmodified pyrocoated tubes, the presence of Ir or Rh causes {{a significant reduction in}} the vaporization efficiency, especially for microgram amounts of copper and aluminum introduced as nitrates, and manganese introduced as a sulfate. The vaporization efficiency, for magnesium and sodium as chlorides, and for lead as a sulfate, remained unchanged. Interestingly, the aging of the tubes was accompanied by partial restoration of the spectral characteristics for unmodified tubes. For example, with unmodified pyrocoated tubes, the vaporization spectrum, appearing {{as a consequence of the}} decomposition of aluminum nitrate, consisted of Al 2 O bands overlapped by Al atomic lines. In the freshly modified tubes, intensities of those lines and bands were substantially reduced, and in this case, the dominance of AlO molecules was observed. The efficiency of vaporization of aluminum species increased in the aged modified tubes. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the modified surfaces for the new and aged tubes indicated that aging of the tubes is accompanied by the destruction of the pyrocoating, formation of pyrographite shells around the areas where the modifier was electrodeposited, and finally, complete substitution of the metal on the graphite surface by pyrographite debris...|$|E

This model is finalized to quantify the <b>vapor</b> mass <b>release</b> <b>rate,</b> from the pool to the surrounding air, caused by pool liquid heating consequent of radiative and convective heat transfer phenomena between flame (and eventually other high temperature bodies) and pool. The lumped parameters grid theory is employed to model the pool heat transfer and vapor generation phenomena.

After an approximate first validation of a model stand-alone version, it was implemented inside ECART. The model validation was carried out by comparison with references data and experimental pool fire test results performed by the model developer’s team. The maximum burning rate, the pool fire duration and the development of phases I (growth - transitory period corresponding to fire development), II (steady-state period corresponding to fully developed fire, with an about invariable burning rate) and III (exhaustion - transitory period preluding the end of fuel, during which both the size of flames and the burning rate decreased continuously up to fire extinction) are mainly analyzed.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{suggested}} for simulation of transient sample <b>vapor</b> composition and <b>release</b> <b>rate</b> during vaporization of analytes in electrothermal (ET) atomizers for AAS. The approach {{is based on}} the Langmuir theory of evaporation of metals {{in the presence of a}} gas at atmospheric pressure, which advocates formation of mass equilibrium in the boundary layer next to the evaporation surface. It is suggested in this work that in ET atomizers the release of atoms and molecules from the boundary layer next to the dry residue of the analyte is accompanied by spreading of the layer around the sample droplets or crystals. Thus, eventually, the vapor source forms an effective area associated with a monolayer of the analyte. In particular, for the case of a metal oxide analyte as discussed in the work, the boundary layer contains the species present in thermodynamic equilibrium with oxide, which are metal atoms and dimers, oxide molecules and oxygen. Because of an excess of Ar, the probability of mass and energy exchange between the evolved gaseous species is low, this substantiates independent mass transport of each type of species from the boundary layer and through absorption volume. Diffusion, capture by Ar flow and gas thermal expansion is considered to control <b>vapor</b> transport and <b>release</b> <b>rate.</b> Each specific flow is affected by secondary processes occurring in collisions of the evolved molecules and atoms with the walls of graphite tube. Diffusion of oxygen containing species out of the boundary layer is facilitated by annihilation of oxygen and reduction of oxide on the graphite surface, while interaction of metal vapor with graphite slows down transport of atomic vapor out of the atomizer. These assumptions are used as the basis for the presentation of the problem as a system of first order differential equations describing mass and temperature balance in the atomizer. Numerical solution of the system of equations provides the simulation of temporal composition of the sample constituents in condensed and gas phase in the atomizer according to chemical properties of the analyte and experimental conditions. The suggested approach avoids the description of atomization processes via kinetic parameters such as activation energy, frequency factor, surface coverage or reaction order...|$|R

At the high <b>release</b> <b>rate,</b> egg to adult survivorship for B. argentifolii was 8 % and parasitism was 23 %. The net reproductive rates (R 0) for B. argentifolii populations in the absence of E. formosa ranged from 18. 01 – 26. 12, indicating a rapidly increasing population. Net repro-ductive rates for whitefly populations subject to wasp releases were 1. 54 for the low <b>release</b> <b>rate</b> greenhouses and 2. 11 for the high <b>release</b> <b>rate</b> greenhouses, indicat-ing substantially reduced B. argentifolii population growth. The low <b>release</b> <b>rate</b> provided better control of B. argentifolii than the high <b>release</b> <b>rate.</b> This differ-ence was attributed to higher levels of mortality of whiteflies at the low <b>release</b> <b>rate</b> in the first 5 – 6 weeks of the growing period. We suggest that mutual interfer-ence may also have affected observed levels of mortal...|$|R
40|$|Barium and lithium <b>vapors</b> were <b>released</b> from {{sounding}} rockets in the thermosphere {{and observed}} from aboard the NASA Convair 990 {{at an altitude}} of 40, 000 ft. The purpose of the releases was to (1) check out observational and operational procedures associated with the large high altitude barium release from a Scout rocket (BIC); (2) develop an all-weather technique for observing chemical releases; (3) evaluate methods of observing daytime releases, and (4) investigate the possibilities of observations from a manned satellite. The initial analysis indicates that the previous limitations on the usage of the <b>vapor</b> <b>release</b> method have been removed by the use of the aircraft and innovative photographic techniques. Methods of analysis and applications to the investigation of the thermosphere are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus <b>release</b> <b>rates</b> from sediments were {{compared}} at two localities of Jordan Reservoir (Czech Republic) during the year. The <b>release</b> <b>rates</b> measured by incubation method were {{an order of}} magnitude higher comparing to the <b>release</b> <b>rates</b> calculated from phosphorus gradient in pore-water. A rapid decomposition of freshly settled seston at the sediment surface or just above the sediment was suggested to explain the differences...|$|R
