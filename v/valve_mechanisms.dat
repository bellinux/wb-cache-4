50|$|Rotary valves are {{potentially}} highly suitable for high-revving engines, {{such as those}} used in racing sportscars and F1 racing cars, on which traditional poppet valves with springs can fail due to valve float and spring resonance and where the desmodromic valve gear is too heavy, large in size and too complex to time and design properly. Rotary valves could allow for a more compact and lightweight cylinder head design. They rotate at half engine speed and lack the inertia forces of reciprocating <b>valve</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This allows for higher engine speeds, offering approximately perhaps 10% more power. The 1980s MGN W12 F1 engine used rotary valves but never raced. Between 2002 and 2004 the Australian developer Bishop Innovation and Mercedes-Ilmor tested rotary valves for a F1 V10 engine.|$|E

50|$|The rear fuselage, {{beginning}} {{just behind}} the open cockpit and {{the trailing edge of}} the wing, was built around four longerons. These connected, via four steel members in the wing centre section, to the engine mountings. The fuselage tapered rearwards to a mid set tailplane and fin. The rudder and separate elevators were both balanced. Ahead of the wing leading edge, the 530 kW (710 hp) Hispano-Suiza 9Vbs nine cylinder radial engine was enclosed by a long chord cowling with small superimposed fairings, two per cylinder, for the <b>valve</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and drove a three blade propeller. The H 100 had a pair of floats close in length to that of the fuselage and fitted with mid-length steps and water rudders at the stern. They were made from védal, duralumin plated with pure aluminium to improve their salt water resistance. Each float was mounted by five streamlined struts, two outwards and upwards to the wing and three upwards to the lower fuselage. This arrangement left the central fuselage to carry bombs if required. The H 110 carried a pair of Darne 7.5 m (0.295 in) calibre machine guns, mounted in the wings just above the floats and firing outside the propeller disc.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The article {{describes}} the method of reliability improvement of the valveactiating gear of the cylinder block head. Materials and Methods: The method of the dimensional analysis was used for definition of the possible travel of hydro compensator <b>valve</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in the new and used cylinder heads of ZMZ 406 motor. The method is based on micrometer research and precise calculations. Results: The hydro compensator travel in the <b>valve</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of new motor cylinder heads of ZMZ- 406 engine is 2. 3 mm with maximum deviations of ± 0. 15 mm. An estimation of dimensional chain was calculated for the rational methods of recovery. The limit values of surface wear were used as the limits of component links. The values were obtained using micrometer researches of used heads of cylinder blocks. When the best combination of wear, possible hydrocompensator travel is 1. 98 mm, and when the worst one minus is 0. 74 mm, that is, the hydrocompensator travel {{is not enough to}} compensate for the wear of component parts. Discussion and Conclusions: The authors of the article propose four ways to improve efficiency of <b>valve</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> As a criterion for selecting a method of repair is proposed to use the total value of the valve. Sinkage for the proposed methods, hydrocompensator travel after repair is from 1. 57 to 2. 36 mm, which corresponds to the hydrocompensator travel of the new motor cylinder heads...|$|E
40|$|The {{function}} of a valve is to alter or regulate a flow or movement, and/or render it unidirectional. The body's <b>valve</b> <b>mechanisms</b> would constitute a fascinating study in themselves {{if for no other}} reason than for the variety of which Mother Nature has availed herself. Some are thought of commonly in terms of 2 -way flow (laryngeal cords, lips, nasal turbinates) while most are thought of as being associated with 1 -way flow (iris, external nares, cricopharyngeal or upper esophageal sphincter, all the heart valves, venous valves, pylorus, sphincter of Oddi, ileo-caecal valve, urethral sphincters). Some are active (anal sphincters) and some passive (valve of the coronary sinus). [ [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Na+ and K+ {{channels}} {{are essential to}} neural signaling, but our current knowledge at the atomic level is mainly limited to the conducting mechanism of K+. Unlike a K+ channel having four equivalent K+-binding sites in its selectivity filter, a NaK channel has a vestibule in the middle part of its selectivity filter, and can conduct both Na+ and K+ ions. However, the underlying mechanism for non-selective ion conduction in NaK remains elusive. Here we find four small grottos connecting with the vestibule of the NaK selectivity filter, which form a vestibule-grotto complex perpendicular to the filter pore with a few water molecules within it. It is shown that {{two or more of}} the water molecules coming to the vestibule to coordinate the cation are necessary for conducting both Na+ and K+ ions, while only one water molecule in the vestibule will obstruct ion permeation. Thus, the complex with the aid of interior water movement forms a dynamic hydration valve which is flexible in conveying different cations through the vestibule. Similar exquisite hydration <b>valve</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are expected to be utilized by other non-selective cation channels, and the results should shed new light on the importance of water in neural signaling...|$|E
40|$|Photosynthesis is an {{important}} driver of ecosystem sustainability {{in the face of}} climate change. Monocotyledonous crop species with C 4 photosynthesis such as maize (Zea mays L; corn) and sugar cane are crucial for future food security and biofuel crop requirements, while C 4 pasture grasses such as Paspalum are central to natural ecosystems. The global demand for corn will exceed that for wheat and rice by 2020, making it the world&#x 27;s most important crop. Light-driven photosynthesis supports plant biomass production, but plants have also evolved safety <b>valve</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that attenuate the absorption of potentially lethal levels of excess light. The array of survival responses that enables leaves to evade photoinhibition is complex and involves chloroplast and leaf movement as well as the molecular rearrangements that facilitate thermal energy dissipation. Here we report a novel morphological mechanism that allows C 4 monocotyledonous leaves to regulate photosynthesis independently on each surface with respect to incident light allowing better adaptation to water deficits and light stress. We show that under abaxial illumination as occurs when monocotyledonous leaves curl in response to water stress the stomata close and photosynthetic metabolism shuts down on the adaxial surface of C 4 leaves but these parameters increase in function to the abaxial surface. We discuss how this regulation confers a survival advantage to the C 4 relative to C 3 leaves which are unable to regulate their dorso-ventral functions in relation to light...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} new {{endoscopic}} approach to the correction of a myelomeningocele-like defect in fetal sheep. Methods: The fetuses of 9 pregnant ewes, with an average gestational age of 115 days, were subjected to a 3. 0 x 2. 0 cm removal of the skin over the lumbar spine, performed through hysterotomy. The uterus was closed, and three 5 -mm endoscopic cannulas, without <b>valve</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> were inserted. In the pilot phase (2 animals), we initially worked exclusively in the amniotic fluid space. In the study phase, we partially withdrew the fetus from the amniotic fluid to completely expose its back. By simply allowing air to enter the amniotic cavity (without gas injection), a working space was created using a uterine lift device. The skin around the defect was dissected, and a biosynthetic cellulose material was applied to cover the area. A continuous suture of the skin was performed to completely hide the material. Results: The combined air/fluid space allowed the skin to be successfully closed in 6 out of 7 cases in the study phase. All fetuses were alive {{at the end of}} the procedures. Time to complete the endoscopic part of the procedure fell from 3 to 1 h by the end of this series. Premature birth occurred in 2 of the 4 cases allowed to continue with the pregnancy. Conclusion: A new gasless fetoscopic surgery technique was developed as an alternative to current techniques used for fetal endoscopic surgery. Copyright (C) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper investigates {{efforts for}} {{controlling}} damping force during the aircraft landing on aircraft carrier. Since flow through restricted opening ensures damping in any system, {{the role of}} a variable orifice is significant. A new self-energized <b>valve</b> <b>mechanism</b> is conceptualized to control the damping force and a mathematical model for energy absorption and then dissipation by means of hydro-pneumatic arresting system is presented. The equation of motion is nonlinear and non-homogenous in nature and has been solved using Taylor's series expansion. Numerical simulation is carried out to extract the performance parameters. The model is capable of predicting the dynamic behavior of the arrester system for variable mass and velocity of landing aircraft. The area of orifice is controlled by self-energized <b>valve</b> <b>mechanism</b> as against contemporary constant run-out control valve.
