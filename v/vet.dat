40|$|The avian acute leukemia virus E 26 encodes {{a fusion}} protein between viral Gag and the {{cellular}} transcription factors cMyb and cEts 1 (p 68). <b>vEts</b> {{on its own}} transforms more mature erythroid cells. We have compared the properties of <b>vEts</b> and cEts 1 (p 68). <b>vEts</b> interacts preferentially with an antibody that recognizes the active conformation of the DNA-binding domain. The DNA-binding activity of <b>vEts</b> is particularly sensitive to incubation conditions for band-shift assays, phosphorylation and modification by sulphydryl-specific reagents. Increased sensitivity is due to loss of a protective function of cEts 1 C-terminal sequences. cEts 2 has a related C-terminal sequence with a similar role. These {{results suggest that the}} <b>vEts</b> DNA-binding domain is more accessible to protein-protein interactions and to regulatory mechanisms. Indeed, <b>vEts</b> DNA binding is preferentially inactivated by oxidizing conditions in-vivo. We suggest that the 'open' conformation of the <b>vEts</b> DNA-binding domain favours interactions with other proteins or DNA and facilitates transformation...|$|R

5|$|The period did {{lead to some}} {{reform of}} {{internal}} Society statutes, such as in 1823 and 1831. The most important change there was the requirement that the Treasurer publish an annual report, along {{with a copy of}} the total income and expenditure of the Society. These were to be sent to Fellows at least 14 days before the general meeting, with the intent being to ensure the election of competent Officers by making it readily apparent what existing Officers were doing. This was accompanied by a full list of Fellows standing for Council positions, where previously the names had only been announced a couple of days before. As with the other reforms, this helped ensure that Fellows had a chance to <b>vet</b> and properly consider candidates. The Society's financial troubles were finally resolved in 1850, when a government grant-in-aid of £1,000 a year was accepted. This was increased to £4,000 in 1876, with the Society officially acting merely as the trustee for these funds, doling them out to individual scientists. This grant has now grown to over £47million, some £37million of which is to support around 370 fellowships and professorships.|$|E
