40|$|The {{beef and}} veal market {{organization}} regime {{is going to be}} strongly reformed by the Mid Term Review (MTR) agreed by the Presidency compromise on 26 June 2003. Actually, the {{beef and veal}} supporting aid-system based on various types of direct farmers’ premia will be turned to a single farm payment. Options for partial decoupling can also be applied even regionally depending on member states decision. For Italian beef and <b>veal</b> <b>sector</b> decoupling is a critical issue. The different Italian livestock production systems and the lower financial support because of a partial application of Agenda 2000 make decisions about decoupling a hardly task. Effects of different decoupling options have been analyzed joint to national ceiling reduction. A positive mathematical programming model has been calibrated on the beef and <b>veal</b> <b>sector</b> of Veneto Region. Results show that a decrease in livestock numbers and farmers’ income is mitigated when partial decoupling is applied. A reduction in young cattle price may further compensate the negative impact of decoupling...|$|E
40|$|The 2003 {{reforms of}} the Common Agricultural Policy of the Euro-pean Union allowed for {{discretionary}} implementation among member states. Discretion was allowed {{with respect to the}} timing and the degree of decoupling of policy support. Differences among member states were particularly apparent in the European beef and <b>veal</b> <b>sector.</b> Using weekly data from 2003 to 2009, we assess the consequences of different national implementation strategies of the reforms on market integration for young calves, which are intensively traded in the European Union. Time series properties are analyzed with a range unit-root test after which a multivariate cointegration model is estimated. We find that the calf markets in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Spain are integrated and tightly interrelated as evidenced by both short and long-run price transmis-sion. We also find strong statistical support for the hypothesis that decoupling reduced calf price levels. Additionally, we ascertain that the outbreak of the Blue Tongue disease induced a structural change in parts of the EU calf market. Using counterfactual scenarios, we provide an indication of the cost involved with granting member states such a high degree of discretion in implementation. We conclude that the national markets studied here belong to a common market. [...] 2003 CAP reform,calf market,decoupling,EU,market integration,price transmission...|$|E
40|$|To improve {{animal health}} and welfare of veal calves, since 1997, the European Union made {{mandatory}} the provision of a minimum daily amount (50 to 250 g) of fibrous feed in addition to the milk replacer diet. However more recently, the high costs of milk replacer ingredients have become an economic incentive {{to increase the amount of}} fibrous feed provided to the calves as partial substitute of the milk replacer. Solid feed provision has been shown to decrease abnormal behaviours such as oral stereotypes and improving calves rumination and rumen development. Moreover, increasing labour cost and herd sizes of the Italian <b>veal</b> <b>sector</b> have supported a growing interest by the calf producers towards the mechanization of the solid feed delivery. The main purpose of this paper is to show how the implementation of mechanized feeding systems can improve feed intake control, feeding rate and delivery efficiency if compared to the manual delivery of the solid portion of calves diet. Indeed, manual feeding is the most diffused system in veal calves dairy farm but exhibits many disadvantages in terms of distribution homogeneity and labour costs for the livestock farm. The study focuses on the results of an electric self-propelled prototype tested in a veal calves farm, allowing mixing of all solid feed ingredients and control of the weight of the feed delivered to each manger. It is shown how nutritional homogeneity can be improved, reducing deviations by a factor of 4 with respect to manual delivery in the case of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber. Additionally it is shown how single ration quantity variability can be reduced from over 30 % in the case of manual delivery to less than 10 % in the case of mechanized delivery...|$|E
40|$|Dit rapport beschrijft de resultaten van een kwaliteitsprogramma voor de {{analyses}} van biologische monsters op de aanwezigheid van residuen van beta-agonisten gericht op de bepaling van clenbuterol. Vier Nederlandse laboratoria, waarvan drie deelnemen aan het officiele Nationale Residu Controle Programma en het officiele laboratorium voor de Stichting Kwaliteitsgarantie van de Vleeskalver Sector (SKV), nemen deel aan dit onderzoek. Uit de resultaten kan geconcludeerd worden dat deze groep laboratoria resultaten voortbrengt die zowel op kwalitatief als op kwantitatief gebied goed overeenkomen. Zowel de binnen - als tussen-laboratoria variaties zijn acceptabel.

40|$|Objectives To {{quantify}} {{associations between}} antimicrobial use and acquired resistance in indicator Escherichia coli {{over a period}} of time which involved sector-wide antimicrobial use reductions in broilers and pigs (years 2004 – 14), veal calves (2007 – 14) and dairy cattle (2005 – 14). Prevalence estimates of resistance were predicted for a hypothetical further decrease in antimicrobial use. Methods Data reported annually for the resistance surveillance programme in the Netherlands were retrieved. Two multivariate random-effects logistic models per animal sector were used to relate total and class-specific antimicrobial use (as defined daily dosages per animal per year, DDDA/Y) with the probability of E. coli resistance to a panel of 10 antimicrobial agents. Results Positive dose–response relationships (ORs) were obtained from all models. Specific resistance phenotypes were more often associated with total antimicrobial use than with class-specific use. The most robust associations were found in pigs and veal calves. Resistance to historically widely used antimicrobials (e. g. penicillins, tetracyclines) was, in relative terms, less influenced by drug use changes over time than resistance to newer or less prescribed antimicrobials (e. g. third-/fourth-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones). In pigs and veal calves, prevalence estimates for the most common resistance phenotypes were projected to decline ∼ 5 %– 25 % during 2014 – 16 if total antimicrobial use reduction reached 80 %; projections for poultry and dairy cows were more modest. Conclusions Epidemiological evidence indicated that drug use history and co-selection of resistance are key elements for perpetuation of resistance. Data suggest that recent Dutch policies aimed at reducing total use of antimicrobials have decreased E. coli resistance in the pig and <b>veal</b> calf production <b>sectors</b> while the impact on the dairy cattle and poultry sectors is less clear. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The Flemish {{veal calf}} {{industry}} is a niche market, which is specialized in rearing dairy, mixed breed or Belgian Blue calves on an iron deficient milk powder diet {{in order to produce}} white veal meat. The sector is for 90 % integrated, implicating a rigid economical approach of production characteristics, diseases and treatment. Veterinary costs are kept at a minimum and therefore diagnostic efforts and non-antimicrobial preventive measures (e. g. vaccinations) are not performed. Objective data on causes of morbidity and mortality in the Flemish <b>veal</b> <b>sector</b> are lacking and data from other countries with similar industries is limited as well. Preliminary results on the first 7 farms of an extensive longitudinal survey are currently available. One round per farm was surveyed, with a total number of 2458 calves. Data on morbidity (individual and group treatments) and mortality were daily recorded. In total 478 calves (19 %) were treated individually at least once. The main reason for individual treatment was bovine respiratory disease (BRD) (64 %). Other reasons were diarrhea (13 %), otitis (8 %), polyserositis (6 %), arthritis (5 %), necrobacillosis (2 %), omphalitis (0. 7 %), neurological disease (0. 4 %) and miscellaneous diseases (1. 5 %). A typical age related distribution of morbidity was seen on all farms, with diarrhea (week 1 - 3) shortly after arrival, followed by respiratory problems (week 2 - 7) with the peak incidence at 4 weeks after arrival. The average number of individual treatment days per production round was 334. 4 days with 4. 5 days per treated calf. Antimicrobial treatments of the entire group were performed on average 7 times per production round. Overall mortality was 5. 2 % (127 calves). Three important causes of mortality were identified: pneumonia (25 %), polyserositis (20 %) and acute ruminal acidosis/ruminitis (15 %). Polyserositis is a pathology that only recently emerged on these farms, which is mainly characterised as a peritonitis without any visible primary source, with or without pleuritis or pericarditis. In most cases pneumonia was present as well. Other causes of mortality were enterotoxaemia (7 %), diarrhea (6 %), omphalitis (4 %), euthanasia due to arthritis (4 %), perforating abomasal ulceration (3 %), neurological disease (3 %) and necrobacillosis (2 %). Mortality was higher in the Belgian Blue calves than in the mixed breed and the dairy breed. Next to the three main causes of mortality, enterotoxaemia in the Belgian Blue breed is a disease of high significance, because it causes mortality {{at the end of the}} production cycle, when animals have a high economic value. Further research on the etiologic agents, the pathological mechanisms and risk factors involved in these diseases is needed in order to create an evidence based preventive approach of veal production. With the issues of antibiotic resistance and animal welfare, such an approach can no longer be delayed...|$|E
