After Eliot's death, Valerie dedicated her time to preserving his legacy, by editing and annotating The Letters of T. S. Eliot and a facsimile of the draft of The Waste Land. Valerie Eliot died on 9 November 2012 at her home in London.|$|E

These observations suggest that the stenotele nematocytes are produced normally by dif-ferentiation from the interstitial cells in the body column of nem- 4 hydra, but that they are somehow prevented from migrating into the tentacles in this strain...|$|R

40|$|Industrial {{relations}} in Ireland have been {{governed by a}} system of social partnership for {{the past twenty years}} (Roche 2007 a). At the centre of this system are national social agreements that aim to control pay increases and launch social and economic initiatives. In the mid-nineties, there was concern that the social partnership regime was too centralised, by-passing relations between employees and management inside organisations. In an effort to address this concern, a big push was made to establish enterprise partnerships in organisations (Teague and Donaghey 2004). A flurry of activity occurred on the matter, creating the promise of the highly successful shared understanding between unions and employers at the national level being replicated inside organisations (Teague 2005). Ten years later this activity has slowed down if not petered out altogether: none of the parties, particularly the trade unions, appear to be working actively on the topic.

2500|$|Admiral Tryon was {{concerned}} that the normal system of signalling between ships would become unworkable in real war conditions. To send a signal required hoisting a flag sequence, waiting for all ships to raise flags to confirm they had seen and understood, and then lowering the initial flags to signal everyone to carry it out. [...] The signals book had grown to hundreds of pages describing the many possible flag combinations and <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> knew them all. In a real battle this process might take too much time, or might be entirely impossible if enemy fire had destroyed the masts from which the flags must fly, or smoke made them impossible to read. Instead, Tryon proposed a simple signal, using the letter-flags T and A, which simply instructed captains to follow their leader. Other flag signals might be used additionally as circumstances allowed, but once the initial order was given, the ships simply had to follow the movements of their leaders. A few, basic, single flag signals were designated for particular movements, which would simply be flown without needing acknowledgement. This was {{a radical departure from}} contemporary practice, in which all movements were precisely signalled from the flagship and acknowledged by their recipients. Opinion was fiercely divided about it, for instance The Times newspaper considered it [...] "unsound in theory and perilous in practice", whilst Rear-Admiral William Kennedy on the East Indies station declared following experiments with it that [...] "the officers commanding thoroughly appreciated the idea which would be invaluable in time of war".|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} dual {{optimization}} concept of predicting optimal sequences {{as well as}} optimal folds of off-lattice protein models {{in the context of}} multi-scale modeling. We validate the utility of the recently introduced hidden-force Monte Carlo optimization algorithm by finding significantly lower energy folds for minimalist and detailed protein models than previously reported. Further, we also find the protein sequence that yields the lowest energy fold amongst all sequences for a given chain length and residue mixture. In particular, for protein models with a binary sequence, we show that the sequence-optimized folds form more compact cores than the lowest energy folds of the historically fixed, Fibonacci-series sequences of chain lengths of 13, 21, 34, 55, and 89. We then extend our search algorithm to use UNRES, one of the leading united-residue protein force fields. Our combined fold and sequence optimization on three test proteins reveal an inherent bias in UNRES favoring alpha helical structures even when secondary structure prediction clearly suggests only beta sheets besides random coil, and <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> helices. <b>One</b> test in particular, a triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet protein domain, demonstrates that by permutations of its sequence UNRES re-folds this structure into a perfect alpha helix but, in fact, the helix is just an artefact of the force field, the structure quickly unfolds in all-atom state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulation.

Only {{in the past few}} years has there been a broad general concern about energy cost and supply. When petroleum prices increased by a factor of 3 to 4 in just a few months, we all became aware of the importance of, and our dependence on energy supplied by other countries; and we became aware that many energy resources are nonrenewable-once used, they are gone forever.

40|$|In the {{tradition}} of just war theory two assumptions have been taken pretty much for granted: first, that {{there are quite a}} lot of justified wars, and second, that there is a moral inequality of combatants, that is, that combatants participating in a justified war may kill their enemy combatants participating in an unjustified war but not vice versa. I will argue that the first assumption is wrong and that therefore the second assumption is virtually irrelevant for reality. I will also argue, primarily against Jeff McMahan, that his particular thesis about the moral inequality of “just” and “unjust combatants” is an analytical truth which, however, does hardly apply to anything (there are few if any “unjust combatants” as he defines them).
