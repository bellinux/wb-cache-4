50|$|Once at optimum temperature, the {{thermostat}} controls {{the flow of}} engine coolant to the radiator so that the engine continues to operate at optimum temperature. Under peak load conditions, such as driving slowly up a steep hill whilst heavily laden on a hot day, {{the thermostat}} will be approaching fully open because the engine will be producing near to maximum power while the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> flow across the radiator is low. (The <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> flow across the radiator has a major effect {{on its ability to}} dissipate heat.) Conversely, when cruising fast downhill on a motorway on a cold night on a light throttle, the thermostat will be nearly closed because the engine is producing little power, and the radiator is able to dissipate much more heat than the engine is producing. Allowing too much flow of coolant to the radiator would result in the engine being over cooled and operating at lower than optimum temperature, resulting in decreased fuel efficiency and increased exhaust emissions. Furthermore, engine durability, reliability, and longevity are sometimes compromised, if any components (such as the crankshaft bearings) are engineered to take thermal expansion into account to fit together with the correct clearances. Another side effect of over-cooling is reduced performance of the cabin heater, though in typical cases it still blows air at a considerably higher temperature than ambient.|$|E

Additionally, lift across the entire chord of the primary airfoil is greatly increased as the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> leaving its trailing edge is raised, from the typical non-flap 80% of freestream, {{to that of the}} higher-speed, lower-pressure air flowing around {{the leading edge of the}} slotted flap. Any flap that allows air to pass between the wing and the flap is considered a slotted flap. The slotted flap was a result of research at Handley-Page, a variant of the slot that dates from the 1920s, but wasn't widely used until much later. Some flaps use multiple slots to further boost the effect.|$|E

50|$|Registers vary in size {{with the}} {{heating and cooling}} {{requirements}} of the room. If a register is too small, the HVAC system will need to push air through the ducts {{at a faster rate}} in order to achieve the desired heating or cooling. This can create rushing sounds which can disturb occupants or interfere with conversation or work (such as sound recording). The <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> through a register is usually kept low enough so that it is masked by background noise. (Higher ambient levels of background noise, such as those in restaurants, allow for higher air velocities.) On the other hand, air velocity must be high enough to achieve the desired temperature. Registers are a critical part of the HVAC system. If not properly installed and tightly connected to the ductwork, air will spill around the register and greatly reduce the HVAC system's efficiency. Ideally, a room will have both heating and cooling registers. In practice, cost considerations usually require that heating and cooling be provided by the same register. In such cases, heating most often takes precedence over cooling, and registers are usually found close to the floor.|$|E

50|$|Renata Limited, a {{prominent}} pharmaceutical company in Bangladesh, tried out {{a pilot project}} {{trying to find out}} whether they could use the Earth Air Tunnel technology to complement the conventional air conditioning system. Concrete pipes with a total length 60 feet (~18¼m), inner diameter 9 inches, (~23 cm) outer diameter 11 inches (~28cm) were placed at a depth of 9 feet (~2¾m) underground and a blower of 1.5 kW rated power was employed. The underground temperature at that depth was found to be around 28 °C. The mean <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> in the tunnel was about 5 m/s. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the underground heat exchanger thus designed was poor ranging from 1.5-3. The results convinced the authorities that in hot and humid climates, it is unwise to implement the concept of Earth-Air heat exchanger. The cooling medium (earth itself) being at a temperature approaching that of the ambient environment happens to be the root cause of the failure of such principles in hot, humid areas (parts of Southeast Asia, Florida in the U.S. etc.). However, investigators from places like Britain and Turkey have reported very encouraging COPs-well above 20. The underground temperature seems to be of prime importance when planning an Earth-Air heat exchanger.|$|E

If {{the ground in}} which the pipe is laid has high points - such as Hi1, 2 etc. and low points between them such as Lo1, 2 etc., then if the pipe is filled from the top, and was empty, the pipe fills OK as far as Hi1. If the water flow velocity is below the rising <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> bubbles ref, then water trickles down to the low point Lo2 and traps the remaining air between Hi1 and Lo2. As more water flows down, the upward leg Lo2 to Hi2 fills up. This exerts a pressure on the trapped air of either H2 m of water (WG = water gauge) or H1, whichever is less. If H2 is greater than H1, {{then you have a}} full air lock, and the water level in the up leg Lo2 to Hi2 stops at H1 and no further water can flow. If H1 is greater than H2, then some water can flow, but the full pipe hydraulic head H3 will not be reached and so flow is much less than expected. If there are further undulations, then the back pressure effects add together. Obviously long pipelines over fairly level, but undulating land, are bound to have many such high and low points. To avoid air or gas lock, automatic vents are fitted which let air or gas out when above a certain pressure. They may also be designed to let air in under vacuum. There are many other design considerations for design of water pipeline systems e.g.|$|E
5000|$|Cyclorotors {{can produce}} lift and thrust at high advance ratios, which, in theory, would enable a {{cyclogyro}} aircraft to fly at subsonic speeds well exceeding those of single rotor helicopters. Single rotor helicopters {{are limited in}} forward speed {{by a combination of}} retreating blade stall and sonic blade tip constraints. As helicopters fly forward, the tip of the advancing blade experiences a wind velocity that is the sum of the helicopter forward speed and rotor rotational speed. This value cannot exceed the speed of sound if the rotor is to be efficient and quiet. Slowing the rotor rotational speed avoids this problem, but presents another. In the traditional method of the composition of velocity it is easy to understand that the velocity experienced by the retreating blade has a value that is produced by the vector composition of the velocity of blade rotation and the freestream velocity. In this condition it is evident that in presence of a sufficiently high advance ratio the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> on the retreating blade is low. The flapping movement of the blade changes the angle of attach. It is then possible for the blade to reach the stall condition. In this case it is necessary that the stalling blade increases the pitch angle to keep some lift capability. This risk puts constraints on the design of the system. An accurate choice of the wing profile is necessary and careful dimensioning of the radius of the rotor for the specified speed range. Slow speed cyclorotors bypass this problem through a horizontal axis of rotation and operating at a comparatively low blade tip speed. For higher speeds, which may become necessary for industrial applications, it seems necessary to adopt more sophisticated strategies and solutions. A solution is the independent actuation of the blades which have been recently patented and successfully tested for naval use [...] by use on hydraulic actuation system. In the aeronautic domain similar solutions appear difficult, because of the necessity of maintaining a low ratio between weight and thrust. One solution has been proposed by the Austrian inventor Meinhard Schwaiger with his turbomachine patent. The horizontal axis of rotation always provides an advancement of the upper blades, that produce always a positive lift by the full rotor. These characteristics could help overcome two issues of helicopters: their low energy efficiency and the advance ratio limitation.|$|E
