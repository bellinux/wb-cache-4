5|$|In 2011, {{a council}} {{gardening}} scheme created a horticultural landscape {{next to the}} southern end of the M32. The project included planting of red poppies, cornflowers, and marigolds. A spokesman said they hoped it would enhance the <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> motorway and provide additional habitats for wildlife including bees and butterflies. The gardens were well-received by locals and led to a city-wide project called Meadow Bristol, to grow similar meadows elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Berkeley House on Piccadilly {{was named}} after John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton who had {{purchased}} its land, and that surrounding it, shortly after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660. In 1696, the Berkeley family sold the house and grounds to the 1st Duke of Devonshire (who renamed it Devonshire House) on the proviso that the <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{rear of the house}} should not be spoiled. Berkeley Square was laid out {{to the rear of the}} house in the 1730s; because of the conditions of sale, houses were only built on the east and west sides of it. The west side still has various mid-18th century buildings along it, while the east side now contains offices including Berkeley Square House.|$|E

5|$|Henry Fownes Luttrell, {{who married}} Margaret, Alexander's daughter, {{and took the}} Luttrell name, moved to Dunster in 1747. The couple {{redesigned}} and redecorated the castle in a Rococo style, including the extensive use of the recently invented and highly fashionable wallpaper. Henry Luttrell raised the ground height of the Lower Ward between 1764 and 1765 to extend the New Way all {{around to the front}} of his mansion, adding additional ornamental towers onto the inside of the Great Gatehouse in the process. A folly, Conygar Tower, was constructed by architect Richard Phelps to improve the <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> castle, and a larger park of 141 hectares (348acres) was built just to the south of the castle, requiring the eviction of a number of tenant farmers.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Johansson debuted on Broadway in {{a revival}} of A <b>View</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bridge, which won her a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress.

5|$|Most {{moments in}} which there is a fantastic {{occurrence}} constitute a change in point of <b>view,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> omniscient narrator to a specific character with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events from the perspective of the slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E

5|$|The Helix has {{traditionally}} been known for offering {{a panoramic view of}} the New York skyline. While local zoning laws prohibit the construction of high-rise buildings that would obstruct sight-lines from higher points in town, as of June 2013 construction of a new residential building partially blocked the <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lower portion of the roadway. As of 2015, the Helix is considered by the PANYNJ to have a working life-span of ten years.

5|$|The {{development}} team {{hoped the}} new title {{would appeal to}} both newcomers and fans of the series, be accessible and introduce the franchise to a broader audience.

The team also considered {{that because of the}} change in audience tastes and the introduction of new video game platforms, altering the game's perspective to first-person was a correct decision. Turning it into a first-person game was the first design choice made by the team, who hoped allowing players to <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> agent's perspective directly would make the game more immersive for players.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of Chester Cathedral gives {{a warm and}} mellow appearance because of the pinkish colour of the sandstone. The proportions appear spacious because the <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west end of the nave to the east end is unimpeded by a pulpitum and the nave, although not long, is both wide and high compared with many of England's cathedrals. The piers of the nave and choir are widely spaced, those of the nave carrying only the clerestory of large windows with no triforium gallery. The proportions are made possible partly because the ornate stellar vault, like that at York Minster, is of wood, not stone.|$|E

5|$|The third {{prototype}} {{made its}} maiden flight in early 1948, but {{the pace of}} the flight testing was leisurely with only 7 hours and 40 minutes completed by 30 November, over half of which were connected with air show performances. Testing concluded in March 1949 when the officer in charge concluded that there was no further purpose to the tests. While the Firecrest was faster than the Firebrand, and gave its pilot a much better <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cockpit, it was otherwise disappointing, with test pilot and naval aviator Captain Eric Brown claiming that the Firecrest was even less manoeuvrable than the sluggish Firebrand, while the powered ailerons gave lumpy controls, leading to instability in turbulent air.|$|E
