The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the condition of cold chain equipment, practices adopted for cold chain maintenance and knowledge of the <b>vaccinators.</b> Methods: It was a cross-sectional study conducted in 20 UHCs of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC). Cold chain equipment were observed with regards to their condition, along with the practices adopted by <b>vaccinators</b> for cold chain maintenance. A pre-designed and pre-tested questionnaire was used to interview the <b>vaccinators</b> regarding their knowledge and awareness regarding cold chain practices, management and handling. Data were entered and analyzed using Epi Info v 3. 5. 1. Simple proportions were calculated. Results: Absence of separate stabilizer for deep freezers and ILRs (85 %), ill-maintained temperature-record register, lack of criss-cross pattern of ice packs in deep freezer (65 %), presence of things other than ice packs in deep freezer (10 %) and things other than vaccines in ILR (10 %) indicate poor cold chain maintenance. In addition to this, expired vaccines in ILR (5 %), vaccines in the "unusable" stages of VVM (15 %), lack of emergency contact number nearby in case of cold chain failure (85 %), lack of inverter (85 %), lack of generator (85 %) and failure to note time of reconstitution on the vaccine vial at the time of vaccination (25 %) indicate poor cold chain practices. Lack of knowledge of defrosting of ILR and deep freezer (45 %), lack of knowledge about Shake test (40 %), lack of knowledge of temperature range to be maintained in deep freezer (70 %) and in ILR (15 %) indicate poor knowledge of <b>vaccinators.</b> Conclusion: Cold chain maintenance and practices need improvement.

At length this commission delivered itself of its final report, a very sensible one in an enormous blue-book, which if adopted would practically have continued the existing Vaccination Acts with amendments. These amendments provided that in future the public <b>vaccinator</b> should visit the home of the child, and, if the conditions of that home and of the child itself were healthy, offer to vaccinate it with glycerinated calf lymph. Also they extended the time during which the parents and guardians were exempt from prosecution, and in various ways mitigated the rigour of the prevailing regulations.

40|$|Participatory {{research}} on vaccination of village poultry against Newcastle disease (ND) {{was carried out}} in the village of Disaneng, in the North West Province of South Africa. Three application methods for ND Inkukhu(R) vaccine were shown to induce sufficient levels of immunity in back-yard poultry when correctly administered. These are eye-droplet administration to individual fowls, in-feed and in-water administration to small flocks. After a community meeting and group discussion to select methods of vaccination, only 2 of the 3 methods were chosen; the individual administration of droplets into the eyes was considered to be too impractical because back-yard fowls are difficult to catch. Visual and practical training material was prepared and presented to volunteer <b>vaccinators</b> (n = 23). <b>Vaccinators</b> were then required to register all the poultry owners in their ward who wished to have poultry vaccinated. Once an indication of the number of chickens to be vaccinated had been made available, ND Nobilis Inkukhu(R) vaccine was supplied to <b>vaccinators</b> free of charge. Community <b>vaccinators</b> were responsible for the organisation of the vaccination campaign, including storage and preparation of vaccine for application. All 9 wards in the village were initially involved with a total of 482 households, owning 6141 chickens, participating. This represented slightly in excess of 60 %of the fowls in the area. Involvement in a 2 nd round of vaccinations, 1 month later, was far poorer with only 211 households owning a total of 1636 chickens participating. Serum samples were collected from vaccinated fowls using systematic random sampling and tested for circulating antibodies. The levels of protection varied, with no significant difference found between in-feed and in-water vaccine administration. Volunteer <b>vaccinators</b> were found to be unreliable, easily demotivated, did not keep good records and left the project when offered permanent employment. Contacting them to make arrangements for delivering vaccine was difficult and time consuming. Structured interviews indicated that deaths in poultry and the attitude of the owners probably contributed to the demotivation of the volunteers used as community <b>vaccinators.</b> It was concluded that volunteers are not the ideal choice for vaccination of village poultry against Newcastle disease...|$|R

60|$|Private practice, thus protected, would itself protect individuals, {{as far as}} such {{protection}} is possible, against the errors and superstitions of State medicine, which are at worst no worse than the errors and superstitions of private practice, being, indeed, all derived from it. Such monstrosities as vaccination are, as we have seen, founded, not on science, but on half-crowns. If the Vaccination Acts, instead of being wholly repealed as they are already half repealed, were strengthened by compelling every parent to have his child vaccinated by a public officer whose salary was completely independent {{of the number of}} vaccinations performed by him, and for whom there was plenty of alternative public health work waiting, vaccination would be dead in two years, as the <b>vaccinator</b> would not only not gain by it, but would lose credit through the depressing effects on the vital statistics of his district of the illness and deaths it causes, whilst it would take from him all the credit of that freedom from smallpox which is the result of good sanitary administration and vigilant prevention of infection. Such absurd panic scandals as that of the last London epidemic, where a fee of half-a-crown per re-vaccination produced raids on houses during the absence of parents, and the forcible seizure and re-vaccination of children left to answer the door, can be prevented simply by abolishing the half-crown and all similar follies, paying, not for this or that ceremony of witchcraft, but for immunity from disease, and paying, too, in a rational way. The officer with a fixed salary saves himself trouble by doing his business with the least possible interference with the private citizen. The man paid by the job loses money by not forcing his job on the public as often as possible without reference to its results.|$|E
60|$|A {{magistrate}} has laws to administer: a censor {{has nothing}} {{but his own}} opinion. A judge leaves the question of guilt to the jury: the Censor is jury and judge as well as lawgiver. A magistrate may be strongly prejudiced against an atheist or an anti- <b>vaccinator,</b> just as a sanitary inspector may have formed a careful opinion that drains are less healthy than cesspools; but the magistrate must allow the atheist to affirm instead of to swear, and must grant the anti-vaccinator an exemption certificate, when their demands are lawfully made; and in cities the inspector must compel the builder to make drains and must prosecute him if he makes cesspools. The law may be only the intolerance of the community; {{but it is a}} defined and limited intolerance. The limitation is sometimes carried so far that a judge cannot inflict the penalty for housebreaking on a burglar who can prove that he found the door open and therefore made only an unlawful entry. On the other hand, it is sometimes so vague, as for example {{in the case of the}} American law against obscenity, that it makes the magistrate virtually a censor. But in the main a citizen can ascertain what he may do and what he may not do; and, though no one knows better than a magistrate that a single ill-conducted family may demoralize a whole street, no magistrate can imprison or otherwise restrain its members on the ground that their immorality may corrupt their neighbors. He can prevent any citizen from carrying certain specified weapons, but not from handling pokers, table-knives, bricks or bottles of corrosive fluid, on the ground that he might use them to commit murder or inflict malicious injury. He has no general power to prevent citizens from selling unhealthy or poisonous substances, or judging for themselves what substances are unhealthy and what wholesome, what poisonous and what innocuous: what he CAN do is to prevent anybody who has not a specific qualification from selling certain specified poisons of which a schedule is kept. Nobody is forbidden to sell minerals without a licence; but everybody is forbidden to sell silver without a licence. When the law has forgotten some atrocious sin--for instance, contracting marriage whilst suffering from contagious disease--the magistrate cannot arrest or punish the wrongdoer, however he may abhor his wickedness. In short, no man is lawfully at the mercy of the magistrate's personal caprice, prejudice, ignorance, superstition, temper, stupidity, resentment, timidity, ambition, or private conviction. But a playwright's livelihood, his reputation, and his inspiration and mission are at the personal mercy of the Censor. The two do not stand, as the criminal and the judge stand, in the presence of a law that binds them both equally, and was made by neither of them, but by the deliberative collective wisdom of the community. The only law that affects them is the Act of 1843, which empowers one of them to do absolutely and finally what he likes with the other's work. And when it is remembered that the slave in this case is the man whose profession is that of Eschylus and Euripides, of Shakespear and Goethe, of Tolstoy and Ibsen, and the master the holder of a party appointment which by the nature of its duties practically excludes the possibility of its acceptance by a serious statesman or great lawyer, it will be seen that the playwrights are justified in reproaching the framers of that Act for having failed not only to appreciate the immense importance of the theatre as a most powerful instrument for teaching the nation how and what to think and feel, but even to conceive that those who make their living by the theatre are normal human beings with the common rights of English citizens. In this extremity of inconsiderateness it is not surprising that they also did not trouble themselves to study the difference between a censor and a magistrate. And it will be found that almost all the people who disinterestedly defend the censorship today are defending him on the assumption that there is no constitutional difference between him and any other functionary whose duty it is to restrain crime and disorder.|$|E

40|$|Background: Current WHO best {{infection}} control practices for injections {{do not address}} the use of hub cutters due to insufficient evidence on safety and efficacy. Objective: To {{assess the impact of}} the use of hub cutters on 1) the frequency of needle-stick injuries (NSIs) and other blood exposures among workers and 2) the volume of sharps waste in a mass vaccination campaign setting. Methods: During yellow fever vaccination in Ghana, we conducted a cohort study on the use of hub cutters. We compared two groups—one group using hub cutters and a control group—for the occurrences of NSIs and the volume of sharp waste produced. Results: In the control arm, <b>vaccinators</b> used 284 482 syringes in 825 vaccination sessions. In the group using hub cutter, <b>vaccinators</b> used 397 079 syringes in 1599 sessions. Among <b>vaccinators,</b> the rate of NSI was not significantly (p= 0. 14) different between the hub cutter users (0. 15 / 10 000 syringes) and the control group (0. 04 / 10 000). Factors such as workload, lack of organization and pressure seemed to have influence the occurrence of NSIs. With all the limitations of the work, the volume of sharp waste per 10 000 syringes was 0. 24 m 3 in the hub cutter users and 0. 41 m 3 in the control group—a reduction of 41. 2 %. <b>Vaccinators</b> found hub cutters easy to use and safe. Use of hub cutter was not associated with increased duration of work. Conclusion: The use of hub cutters did not increase the risk of NSIs.

WHO and UNICEF embarked on a programme to develop and introduce these devices in 1987. We report on a field trial in Karachi, Pakistan, of the SoloShot (SS) plastic disposable syringe, which has a metal clip in the syringe barrel to prevent second-time withdrawal of the plunger. A conventional disposable syringe (CS) was used as a comparison. We observed 48 <b>vaccinators</b> giving 2400 injections with the SS and 1440 with the CS; 98. 7 % of SS performed as designed.

40|$|Transmission of {{bloodborne}} pathogens {{by means}} of unsafe injection practices is a significant public health problem in developing countries. Although the overall proportion for immunization is low among injections, unsafe immunization practices affect mostly infants, a population with an increased likelihood of becoming hepatitis B virus carriers. This study estimated the prevalence of unsafe injection among <b>vaccinators</b> working at the peripheral level in northwestern China {{and the risk of}} HBV infections among infant vaccinees, and analyzed factors contributing to the most prevalent unsafe practice: the reuse of a non-sterilized reusable syringe among infants. A knowledge-attitude-practice survey was conducted in which 180 peripheral <b>vaccinators</b> selected by multi-stage cluster sampling in each of four provinces and one autonomous region completed a self-administered questionnaire. The lack of observational data for assessing the validity of the self-reported practices made the study prone to systematic respondent bias that may have skewed the results towards underestimation of unsafe practices. The minimum estimate of the percentage of peripheral <b>vaccinators</b> reusing a syringe and/or needle without sterilization between infants was 7. 2 - 55. 0 %, whereas the percentage of those disposing of used disposable syringes and needles inappropriately was 8. 9 - 23. 3 % by province. According to a model-based estimate, the annual number of HBV infections among 100, 000 fully immunized children due to unsafe immunization injection was at least 135 - 3120. An insufficient supply of syringes and the attitude to justify reuse were significantly associated with the unsafe reuse of a reusable syringe in most part of the area studied. Introduction of auto-disable syringes may contribute to curb the unsafe practices, but the development of safe collection and disposal procedures for used syringes and needles is prerequisite. Sufficient supply of equipment as well as training, supervision, and monitoring targeting specifically on the risk behaviors and concerned attitudes are essential for behavior changes among the <b>vaccinators.</b> Immunization programs Infant Injections Hepatitis B China...|$|R
40|$|A social {{strategy}} was tested for implementing Newcastle disease (ND) vaccination and biosecurity improvements among free-ranging chicken at village level in Tanzania. In addition to training the local poultry <b>vaccinators,</b> data recorders and poultry-keepers, the strategy involved training and empowering {{leaders at the}} district, ward and village level. The trainings covered poultry health, management, and marketing of village chickens, {{with an emphasis on}} ND vaccination and improving biosecurity against avian influenza (AI), The study sites included villages in one ward in each of three each three districts (Iringa, Mtwara-Mikindani, and Mvomero) of mainland Tanzania. Ninety-six local leaders at district level and 101 leaders at ward levels were trained. In addition, 196 farmers (households) were trained, as well as 86 <b>vaccinators</b> and 26 data recorders. Data recorders were also trained as poultry first aid workers. ND vaccination was conducted by the <b>vaccinators,</b> supervised by their local leaders with technical assistance from veterinarians. A total of 158, 343 village chickens were vaccinated in three rounds of vaccination three months apart. The training and empowerment of local leaders and local implementers was the key element for success as it fostered the feeling of local ownership of the program and prevented conflicts with other development activities within the villages. We conclude that most animal health programs will increase their odds of success by involving local leaders and by addressing the current challenges facing the farmers.
