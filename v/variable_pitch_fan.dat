50|$|A <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fan</b> is a {{mechanism}} used to vary the fan pitch {{similar to that}} of a variable-pitch propeller. Variable pitch fans are also used in some other applications, such as industrial.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{solution is to}} fit a <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fan.</b> Scheduling the pitch of the fan blades has no impact upon {{the position of the}} fan working lines, but can be used to move the surge line upwards, to improve fan surge margin.|$|E
40|$|Two V/STOL {{propulsion}} concepts {{were evaluated}} {{in a common}} aircraft configuration. One propulsion system consists of cross coupled turboshaft engines driving <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fans.</b> The other system is a gas coupled combination of turbojet gas generators and tip turbine fixed <b>pitch</b> <b>fans.</b> Evaluations were made of endurance at low altitude, low speed loiter with equal takeoff fuel loads.

50|$|A geared, <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fan,</b> {{replaced}} {{the first stage}} of the low pressure (LP) compressor. A modest fan pressure ratio, consistent with the high bypass ratio, meant a low fan tip speed could be employed. A low hot jet velocity was another major design feature.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s, Rolls-Royce/SNECMA {{tested a}} M45SD-02 {{turbofan}} fitted with <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fan</b> blades to improve handling at ultra low fan pressure ratios {{and to provide}} thrust reverse down to zero aircraft speed.

40|$|Two {{types of}} lift/cruise fan {{technology}} aircraft were conceptually designed. One aircraft used turbotip fans pneumatically interconnected to three gas generators, {{and the other}} aircraft used <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fans</b> mechanically interconnected to three turboshaft engines. The components of each propulsion transmission system were analyzed and designed to the depth necessary to determine areas of risk, development methods, performance, weights and costs.

The lift/cruise fan thrust vectoring hoods, which are applicable to either aircraft configuration, were also evaluated to assure a low cost/low risk approach...|$|R
50|$|The engine {{combines}} an Astazou-derived {{centrifugal compressor}} {{with up to}} three axial compressor stages (depending on the version of the engine), driven by a common driveshaft. The fan section is composed of a unique <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fan</b> and fixed stator blades mounted {{at the front of}} the engine. Blade pitch is varied by a hydraulic piston mounted in the fan hub, while the fan itself is powered via a reduction gear from the main driveshaft.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fan</b> will {{facilitate}} low pressure ratio fan operability. Rolls-Royce {{will work with}} Industria de Turbo Propulsores to test IP turbine technologies that will go into the UltraFan. In Dahlewitz near Berlin, Rolls-Royce has built a power rig simulating loading conditions in flight, sized for [...] gear systems; and recruits 200 engineers. The ratio of the initial test gear will approach 4:1 and thrust could be up to [...] The specially constructed test rig is an €84 million ($94 million) ­investment.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the concept}} took {{over three years}} to refine, the NOTAR system is simple in theory and works to provide some {{directional}} control using the Coandă effect. A <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fan</b> is enclosed in the aft fuselage section immediately forward of the tail boom and driven by the main rotor transmission. This fan forces low pressure air through two slots {{on the right side}} of the tailboom, causing the downwash from the main rotor to hug the tailboom, producing lift, and thus a measure of directional control. This is augmented by a direct jet thruster and vertical stabilisers.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the preliminary {{design of a}} stability augmentation system for a NASA V/STOL research and technology airplane. This stability augmentation system is postulated as the simplest system that meets handling qualities levels for research and technology missions flown by NASA test pilots. The airplane studied in this report is a T- 39 fitted with tilting lift/cruise fan nacelles and a nose fan. The propulsion system features a shaft interconnecting the three <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fans</b> and three power plants. The mathematical modeling is based on pre-wind tunnel test estimated data. The selected stability augmentation system uses variable gains scheduled with airspeed. Failure analysis of the system illustrates the benign effect of engine failure. Airplane rate sensor failure must be solved with redundancy...|$|R
50|$|<b>Variable</b> <b>pitch</b> axial <b>fans</b> - The blades {{on these}} axial fans are {{manually}} adjustable {{to permit the}} blade angle to be changed. This allows operation over a much wider range of volume/pressure relationships. The blades are adjusted periodically to optimize efficiency by matching the blade pitch to the varying conditions for the application. These fans are often used in mining applications.|$|R
40|$|The design, fabrication, {{and testing}} of two {{experimental}} propulsion systems for powered lift transport aircraft are given. The under the wing (UTW) engine was intended for installation in an externally blown flap configuration and the over the wing (OTW) engine for use in an upper surface blowing aircraft. The UTW engine included <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> composite <b>fan</b> blades, main reduction gear, composite fan frame and nacelle, and a digital control system. The OTW engine included a fixed <b>pitch</b> <b>fan,</b> composite fan frame, boilerplate nacelle, and a full authority digital control.

50|$|On 26 February 2014, Rolls-Royce {{detailed}} its Trent future developments. The Advance is {{the first}} design could be ready {{from the end of}} the 2010s and aim to offer at least 20% better fuel burn than the first generation of Trents. Next is the UltraFan, which could be ready for service from 2025, a geared turbofan with a <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fan</b> system, promising at least 25% improvement in fuel burn. The Advance bypass ratio should exceed 11:1 and its overall pressure ratio 60:1, while the geared/variable pitch UltraFan aims for a 15:1 bypass ratio and 70:1 overall pressure ratio.|$|E
50|$|The {{most visible}} {{characteristic}} of the W.9 was torque compensation and directional control by using blown air rather than a tail propeller. A <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fan</b> cooled the engine; the heated air and engine exhaust passed through the long hollow tailboom and exhausted to port. Foot pedals controlled the fan pitch. Of more importance, however, was the hydraulically-powered shaft-driven tilting rotor hub with rotational speed variation to give automatic collective pitch control. Development of the rotor system resulted in a tilting hub combined with cyclic pitch control of each blade to minimize control forces. Manual control of collective pitch {{was added to the}} automatic collective pitch change system to provide precise vertical control in hover and the ability to cushion a landing from an autorotative descent.|$|E
50|$|NOTAR, {{an acronym}} for NO TAil Rotor, is a {{helicopter}} anti-torque system that eliminates {{the use of the}} tail rotor on a helicopter. Although the concept took some time to refine, the NOTAR system is simple in theory and provides antitorque the same way a wing develops lift by using the Coandă effect. A <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fan</b> is enclosed in the aft fuselage section immediately forward of the tail boom and is driven by the main rotor transmission. To provide the sideways force to counteract the clockwise torque produced by a counterclockwise-spinning main rotor (as seen from above the main rotor), the variable-pitch fan forces low pressure air through two slots {{on the right side of}} the tailboom, causing the downwash from the main rotor to hug the tailboom, producing lift and thus a measure of antitorque proportional to the amount of airflow from the rotorwash. This is augmented by a direct jet thruster which also provides directional yaw control, with the presence of a fixed-surface empennage near the end of the tail, incorporating vertical stabilizers.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} test procedure for the QCSEE (quiet, clean, short-haul experimental engine). The engines designed for the YC- 14 and YC- 15 STOL aircraft, both use a very low fan pressure ratio to keep jet-flap noise about 3 dB below total system noise. Other noise reducing features discussed are the low tip speed fans and a carefully selected number of fan blades and vanes with adequate spacing between them. Attention is also given {{to the development of}} a low emissions combustor, and reduction of fan frame weight, through the use of graphite/epoxy material. The YC- 15 engine also employs <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fans</b> to provide thrust reversal, thus saving weight. Finally, it is noted that the tests have proven that the engines could be configurated to meet the needs of a powered lift system without excessively compromising performance or weight...|$|R
40|$|A flight {{simulation}} {{program was}} conducted on the flight simulator for advanced aircraft (FSAA). The flight simulation was a part of a contracted effort to provide a lift/cruise fan V/STOL aircraft mathematical model for flight simulation. The simulated aircraft is a configuration of the Lift/Cruise Fan V/STOL research technology aircraft (RTA). The aircraft was powered by three gas generators driving three fans. One lift fan was installed in the nose of the aircraft, and two lift/cruise fans at the wing root. The thrust of these fans was modulated to provide pitch and roll control, and vectored to provide yaw, side force control, and longitudinal translation. Two versions of the RTA were defined. One was powered by the GE J 97 /LF 460 propulsion system which was gas-coupled for power transfer between fans for control. The other version was powered by DDA XT 701 gas generators driving 62 inch <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fans.</b> The flight control system in both versions of the RTA was the same...|$|R
50|$|<b>Variable</b> <b>pitch</b> {{on-the-fly}} axial <b>fans</b> - These {{are similar}} to “Variable Pitch Axial Fans” except they include an internal mechanism that allows the blade pitch to be adjusted while the fan rotor is in motion. These versatile fans offer high-efficiency operation at many different points of operation. This instantaneous blade adjustment capability is an advantage that is possible with axial fans only.|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{computer}} simulations of the under-the-wing engine were constructed {{to develop the}} dynamic design of the controls. The engine and control system includes a <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fan</b> and a digital electronic control. Simulation results for throttle bursts from 62 to 100 percent net thrust predict that the engine will accelerate 62 to 95 percent net thrust in one second...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} test {{results of the}} final under-the-wing engine configuration are presented. One hundred and six hours of engine operation were completed, including mechanical and performance checkout, baseline acoustic testing with a bellmouth inlet, reverse thrust testing, acoustic technology tests, and limited controls testing. The engine includes a <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fan</b> having advanced composite fan blades and using a ball-spline pitch actuation system...|$|E
40|$|Tests {{conducted}} {{to develop the}} technology necessary to meet the unique reverse-thrust performance requirements of a <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fan</b> propulsion system are discussed. The losses and distortion associated with the air entering the fan and core compressor {{from the rear of}} the engine, the direction of fan blade pitch rotation for best reverse-thrust aeroacoustic performance, and engine response and operating characteristics during forward- to reverse-thrust transients are among the factors studied. The test results of several scale fan models as well as a full-size <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fan</b> engine are summarized. Results show the following: a flared exhaust nozzle makes a good reverse-thrust inlet; acceptable core inlet duct recovery and distortion levels in reverse flow were demonstrated; adequate thrust levels were achieved; forward- to reverse-thrust response time achieved was better than the goal; thrust and noise levels strongly favor reverse through feather pitch; and finally, flight-type inlets make the establishment of reverse flow more difficult...|$|E
50|$|McDonnell Douglas {{developed}} the NOTAR (NO TAil Rotor) system, which eliminates having any rotating parts {{out in the}} open. The NOTAR system uses a <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> ducted <b>fan</b> driven by the helicopter's powerplant, but the ducted fan is mounted inside the fuselage ahead of the tail boom, and the exhaust passes through the tail boom to the end, where it is expelled out one side. This creates a boundary layer which causes the downwash from the main rotor to hug the tail boom according to the Coandă effect. This creates a force which cancels out the main rotor torque and provides directional control. The advantages of the system {{are similar to the}} Fenestron system discussed above.|$|R
40|$|The {{noise level}} of an uncoventional {{propulsion}} {{system for the}} next generation of subsonic, long-range transport aircraft is discussed. The desired noise level may be achieved by: (1) a fixed geometry, high bypass ratio turbofan with a geared two-stage fan and advanced acoustic treatment or (2) a moderate bypass ratio turbofan with a <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> two-stage <b>fan,</b> <b>variable</b> primary and duct nozzles, and advanced acoustic treatment. The geared fan system meets the noise goal with minimum economic penalty. Comparison of the noise levels at takeoff and landing in combination with the economic penalties required to achieve the lower noise levels at specific noise measuring stations, indicate that both area reduction and current certification prodedures should be used to ascertain the point of diminishing returns in establishing future noise goals...|$|R
40|$|Low speed {{wind tunnel}} tests were {{conducted}} to assess four methods for attaining thrust modulation for V/STOL aircraft. The four methods were: (1) fan speed change, (2) fan nozzle exit area change, (3) <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> rotor (VPR) <b>fan,</b> and (4) {{variable inlet guide vanes}} (VIGV). The interrelationships between inlet and thrust modulation system were also investigated using a double slotted inlet and thick lip inlet. Results can be summarized as: (1) the VPR and VIGV systems were the most promising, (2) changes in blade angle to obtain changes in fan thrust have significant implications for the inlet, and (3) both systems attained required level of thrust with acceptable levels of fan blade stress...|$|R
40|$|A {{low speed}} {{wind tunnel test}} of a fixed lip inlet with engine, was performed. The inlet was close coupled to a Hamilton Standard 1. 4 meter, <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fan</b> driven by a lycoming T 55 -L- 11 A engine. Tests were {{conducted}} with various combinations of inlet angle of attack freestream velocities, and fan airflows. Data were recorded to define the inlet airflow separation boundaries, performance characteristics, and fan blade stresses. The test model, installation, instrumentation, test, data reduction and final data are described...|$|E
40|$|A <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fan</b> {{actuation}} system was designed which incorporates a remote nacelle-mounted blade angle regulator. The regulator drives a rotating fan-mounted mechanical actuator through a flexible shaft and differential gear train. The actuator incorporates a high ratio harmonic drive {{attached to a}} multitrack spherical cam which changes blade pitch through individual cam follower arms attached to each blade trunnion. Detail design parameters of the {{actuation system}} are presented. These include the following: design philosophies, operating limits, mechanical, hydraulic and thermal characteristics, mechanical efficiencies, materials, weights, lubrication, stress analyses, reliability and failure analyses...|$|E
40|$|A {{full scale}} inlet test {{was to be}} done in the NASA-ARC 40 ' X 80 ' WT to {{demonstrate}} satisfactory inlet performance at high angles of attack. The inlet was designed to match a Hamilton-Standard 55 inch, <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>fan,</b> driven by a Lycoming T 55 -L- 11 A gas generator. The test was installed in the wind tunnel on two separate occasions, but mechanical failures in the fan drive gear box early in each period terminated testing. A detailed description is included of the Model, installation, instrumentation and data reduction procedures...|$|E
40|$|A 1. 294 {{pressure}} ratio, 725 ft/sec tip speed, <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> {{low noise}} <b>fan</b> {{was designed and}} tested in the NASA Glenn 9 - by 15 -foot Wind Tunnel. The design included a casing treatment that used recirculation to extend the fan stall line and provide an acceptable operating range. Overall aerodynamic experimental results are presented for this low tip speed, low noise fan without casing treatment as well as using several variants of the casing treatment that moved the air extraction and insertion axial locations. Measurements were made to assess effects on performance, operability, and noise. An unusual instability was discovered near the design operating line and is documented in the fan operating range. Measurements were made to compare stall margin improvements as well as measure the performance impact of the casing treatments. Experimental results {{in the presence of}} simulated inlet distortion, via screens, are presented for the baseline and recirculation casing treatment configurations. Estimates are made for the quantity of recirculation weight flow based on limited instrumentation in the recirculation system along with discussion of results and conclusion...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} research {{involving an}} in-service {{failure of a}} “variable pitch in motion” fan’s blade bearing. <b>Variable</b> <b>pitch</b> in motion <b>fans</b> rotate at a constant speed, with the changing blade angle varying the load. A pitch-change mechanism facilitates the change in blade angle. A blade bearing supports each blade enabling it to rotate. The author observed that as the fan aerodynamic stage loading progressively increased, so did the rate of blade-bearing wear. The reported research addressed two separate, but linked, needs. First, the ongoing need to increase fan pressure development capability required an increase in fan loading. This increase was {{within the context of}} an erosive operating regime which systematically reduced fan pressure development capability. The second need was to identify the root cause of blade-bearing failures. The author addressed the linked needs using a computational analysis, improving the rotor inflow aerodynamic characteristics through an analysis of the inlet box and design of inlet guide vanes to control flow nonuniformities at the fan inlet. The results of the improvement facilitated both an increase in fan-pressure-developing capability and identification of the root cause of the blade-bearing failures...|$|R
