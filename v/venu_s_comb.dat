40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} novel {{classification}} of frogs {{in the family}} Mantellidae, based on published phylogenetic information and on a new analysis of molecular data. Our molecular tree for 53 mantellid species is based on 2419 base pairs of the mitochondrial 12 S rRNA, 16 S rRNA, tRNAVal and cytochrome b genes, and of the nuclear rhodopsin gene. Because the genus Mantidactylus Boulenger sensu lato is confirmed to be paraphyletic with respect to Mantella Boulenger, and is highly diverse in morphology and reproductive biology, we propose to partition Mantidactylus into seven genera by elevating four subgenera to genus rank (Blommersia Dubois, Guibemantis Dubois, Spinomantis Dubois, and Gephyromantis Methuen) and creating two new genera (Boehmantis gen. n. and Wakea gen. n.). In addition, we create the new subgenera Boophis (Sahona) subgen. n., Gephyromantis (Duboimantis) subgen. n., G. (Vatomantis) subgen. n., and Mantidactylus (Maitsomantis) subgen. n. The following species are transferred to Spinomantis, based on their phylogenetic relationships: <b>S.</b> elegans (Guibé) <b>comb.</b> n. (formerly in Mantidactylus subgenus Guibemantis); <b>S.</b> bertini (Guibé) <b>comb.</b> n. and <b>S.</b> guibei (Blommers-Schlösser) <b>comb.</b> n. (both formerly in Mantidactylus subgenus Blommersia); <b>S.</b> microtis (Guibé) <b>comb.</b> n. (formerly in Boophis Tschudi). Within Boophis, the new B. mandraka species group and B. albipunctatus species group are established. Boophis rhodoscelis (Boulenger) is transferred to the B. microtympanum group. The following five species are revalidated: Mantidactylus bellyi Mocquard and M. bourgati Guibé (not junior synonyms of M. curtus (Boulenger)); M. cowanii (Boulenger) (not syn. M. lugubris (Duméril)); M. delormei Angel (not syn. M. brevipalmatus Ahl); Mantella ebenaui (Boettger) (not syn. M. betsileo (Grandidier)). The new classification accounts for recent progress {{in the understanding of}} the phylogeny and natural history of these frogs, but it is still tentative for a number of species. Future modifications may be necessary, especially as concerns species now included in Gephyromantis and Spinomantis. Full article published online at: [URL]...|$|R

40|$|In {{this issue}} of the Links we have {{interwoven}} essays from the MCS and Nursing councils. Why? In the MCS field VAD coordinators play a very important role, no less important than in the transplant field, as Eric Hobson from Philadelphia explains in his essay. With the increased complexity of VAD systems and the large amount of information created, stored and potentially available for analysis, bioengineers have stepped into the forefront in the MCS field. On the other hand, classic nursing tasks such as dressing change are reduced with the current systems, due to lower driveline infection rates than with extracorporeal or implantable pulsatile systems, and will be eliminated altogether with transcutaneous energy transfer in the future. So, we are following the role changes in the MCS field—from nursing to management and from dressing change to data analysis. One such example is provided by a bioengineer from our center, Friedrich Kaufmann. He writes in particular about sound analysis to detect pump thrombosis. Since last year, we no longer perform pump exchange before getting positive results of sound analysis (in particular for HeartWare HVAD) and technical data from the pumps. This analysis is documented and stored electronically in the official patient file. Pamela <b>S.</b> <b>Combs</b> calls it "shared decision-making " in her essay, and {{this is the only way}} to translate different information about the new system—“machine-human interaction”—into a decision. However, there is no shared responsibility in such a case: the decision to exchange the pump or not remains strictly the domain of the operating surgeon...|$|R

This paper {{is based on}} the previous checklist by Florschütz-de Waard & Florschütz (1979), publications since that time, on the extensive holdings of the New York Botanical Garden, the Institute of Systematic Botany, Utrecht, and other herbaria, and on recent field work.

Two new species are described: Anaptomecus temii sp. n. and A. levyi sp. n...|$|R
50|$|In 1955, Kevin and Faith Carlson are {{travelling}} {{through the}} country {{when they see a}} meteorite strike over the next hill. On investigation, they discover an alien spacecraft manned by insectoid beings. The Carlsons race to the nearest town to report what they've seen, but the local sheriff insists that a military plane has crashed. The sheriff takes the Carlsons back to the impact site, where they find a team of U. <b>S.</b> Army scientists <b>combing</b> through a wrecked airplane. Kevin notices that the hands of the army personnel are all deformed in the same unusual way, and so are the sheriff's. He and Faith quietly leave the site and return to town, but they cannot convince anyone that something strange is happening.|$|R
40|$|Four new small-celled naviculoid diatom species {{belonging}} to the genera Adlafia, Chamaepinnularia, Mayamaea, and Microcostatus were found during {{a survey of the}} non-marine diatom flora of the South Shetland Islands and James Ross Island (Maritime Antarctic Region). Following both light and scanning electron microscopy, the following species were described as new: Adlafia submuscora sp. nov., Mayamaea josefelsteri Kopalová, Nedbalová & Van de Vijver sp. nov., Microcostatus australoshetlandicus sp. nov. and Chamaepinnularia antarctica sp. nov. The new species are compared to other morphologically similar species from Europe, South America and the (sub-) Antarctic region. Data on their ecology and biogeography are included. In addition, the morphology, biogeography and taxonomic position of two other small-celled naviculoid diatoms, Craticula glaberrima (W. & G. <b>S.</b> West) nov. <b>comb.</b> and Sellaphora nana (Hustedt) Lange-Bertalot et al. are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} reconstructions of Phoebichnus trochoides and Schaubcylindrichnus (Palaeophycus) heberti {{created as}} part of this thesis allow us to fully understand and characterize the three-dimensional morphology and palaeobiology of these common taxa. Three-dimensional reconstructions demonstrate that P. trochoides is a large stellate burrow composed of numerous long galleries produced by a deposit feeding organism. This study reports {{for the first time that}} the central zone is composed of stacked disk-shaped layers of highly bioturbated sediment, the radial burrows are composed of a sand-rich lining of pelleted annuli surrounding an active sand-rich fill, and the presence of subtle conical features above the radial galleries that are inferred to result from collapse cone feeding. Reconstructions of heberti demonstrate that the thick walled burrows are composed of sand-rich annular rings, are a broad U-shape, and may be either clustered or isolated. Our observations show that the morphology of heberti is inconsistent with the generic diagnosis of Palaeophycus, but is morphologically comparable to Schaubcylindrichnus, and is herein synonymised with Schaubcylindrichnus to create <b>S.</b> heberti <b>comb.</b> nov. The three-dimensional reconstructions have revealed a number of hitherto unknown morphological elements to both taxa which has facilitated new interpretations of the trace-makers behaviour. The data improves the taxonomic understanding of both P. trochoides and S. heberti which require significant taxonomic change and emendation of diagnoses at the species and genus level...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEight pestalotioid fungi were {{isolated}} from the Restionaceae growing in the Cape Floral Kingdom of South Africa. Sarcostroma restionis, Truncatella megaspora, T. restionacearum and T. spadicea are newly described. New records include Pestalotiopsis matildae, Sarcostroma lomatiae, Truncatella betulae and T. hartigii. To resolve generic affiliations, phylogenetic analyses were performed on ITS (ITS 1, 5. 8 S, ITS 2) and part of 28 S rDNA. DNA data support the original generic concept of Truncatella, which encompasses Pestalotiopsis species having 3 -septate conidia. The genus Sarcostroma is retained as separate from Seimatosporium. Taxonomic novelties: Pestalotiopsis matildae (Richatt) S. Lee & Crous comb. nov., Truncatella betulae (Morochk.) <b>S.</b> Lee& Crous <b>comb.</b> nov., Sarcostroma restionis S.
