40|$|Abstract We {{describe}} {{the use of}} parametric representations of Boolean predicates to encode data-space constraints and significantly extend the capacity of formal verification. The constraints are used to decompose <b>verifications</b> <b>by</b> sets of case splits and to restrict <b>verifications</b> <b>by</b> validity conditions. Our technique is applicable to any symbolic simulator. We illustrate our technique on state-of-the-art Intel (R) designs, without removing latches or modifying the circuits in any way. ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{specialised}} formal methods {{exist for}} specifying and verifying real-time systems. We propose extending a traditional method {{in order to}} model time with a pattern. In order to carry out <b>verification</b> <b>by</b> model-checking, we demonstrate a new instance of a pattern for real-time modelling. The former pattern is useful to carry out <b>verification</b> <b>by</b> theorem proving. The equivalence with the previous version is studied, and interesting properties for model-checking are reviewed. Finally we report on an experimental case-study...|$|R
