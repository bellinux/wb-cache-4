50|$|Microphallus turgidus {{exclusively}} uses Potamopyrgus antipodarum as {{the intermediate}} host, {{and the final}} hosts are waterfowl. Embryonated Microphallus turgidus eggs are ingested from sediment and hatch in the snail's gut, penetrate the intestine, and migrate to the gonads and digestive gland. Following successful establishment, the parasite then undergoes asexual reproduction, replacing much of the host's reproductive tissue and digestive gland, which results in complete sterilization of the snail. The first <b>visible</b> <b>parasite</b> developmental stages (blastocercariae) are detectable after approximately 75 days post-exposure and metacercariae are common by 90 days post-exposure at 16 °C in the lab. The life cycle continues through a secondary intermediate host, such as the glass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio, and is completed when the shrimp infected by the metacercariae are consumed by waterfowl or mammals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: Rodents are {{considered}} as reservoirs of various zoonotic diseases including helminthic infections. The current study aimed {{to evaluate the}} prevalence of helminth infections in rodents, in Boyer-Ahmad district, Southwestern Iran. Methods: Overall, 52 rodents were captured from various areas of the district by Sherman live traps. The animals were then euthanized and dissected. During necropsy, each organ was examined macroscopically for presence of any cyst or <b>visible</b> <b>parasite.</b> The gastrointestinal tract was removed and their contents were evaluated for larva or adult worms. Trichinella larvae in the rodents’ muscles were investigated by both digestion and pathological methods. Results: Twenty-eight (53. 8 %) of the trapped rodents were male. The rodents were including 25 (48. 1 %) Meriones persicus, 1 (1. 9 %) Calomyscus bailwardi, 1 (1. 9 %) Arvicola terresterris, 7 (13. 5 %) Rattus rattus, 8 (15. 4 %) R. norvegicus, and 10 (19. 2 %) Apodemus sylvaticus. Of them, 38 (73. 0 %) were infected {{with at least one}} helminth. Collected rodents were infected with Hymenolepis diminuta (50 %), Hymenolepis nana fraterna (28. 8 %), Skrjabinotaenia sp. (15. 4 %), Anoplocephalidae sp. (15. 4 %), Cysticercus fasciolaris (5. 8 %), Trichuris muris (36. 5 %), Aspiculuris tetraptera (15. 4 %), Syphacia sp. (5. 7 %), Rictularia sp. (15. 4 %), Trichostrongylus sp. (3. 8 %), and Gongylonema sp. (3. 8 %). M. persicus was the most (84 %) infected rodent, yet the differences between rodent genus and helminth infectivity were not statistically significant (P > 0. 05). Conclusion: The rodents in Boyer-Ahmad district are infected with different helminths infections that some of them are recognized as threat to human health...|$|E

40|$|Production of {{nitric oxide}} by macrophages is {{believed}} to be an important microbicidal mechanism for a variety of intracellular pathogens, including Toxoplasma gondii. Mice with a targeted disruption of the inducible nitric oxide synthase gene (iNOS) were infected orally with T. gondii tissue cysts. Time to death was prolonged compared with parental controls. Histologic analysis of tissue from infected mice showed scattered small foci of inflammation with parasites in various tissues of iNOS−/− mice, whereas tissue from the parental C 57 BL/ 6 mice had more extensive tissue inflammation with few <b>visible</b> <b>parasites.</b> In particular, extensive ulceration and necrosis of distal small intestine and fatty degeneration of the liver was seen in the parental mice at day 7 postinfection, as compared with the iNOS−/− mice where these tissues appeared normal. Serum interferon γ and tumor necrosis factor α levels postinfection were equally elevated in both mouse strains. Treatment of the parental mice with a NO synthase inhibitor, aminoguanidine, prevented early death in these mice as well as the hepatic degeneration and small bowel necrosis seen in acutely infected control parentals. These findings indicate that NO production during acute infection with T. gondii can kill intracellular parasites but can be detrimental, even lethal, to the host...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of the zoonoses caused by L 3 Anisakidae larvae lies in the repercussion that this parasite 22 exerts on food safety and quality. EU legislation recommends fish operators to do visual inspection of the 23 whole fish abdominal cavity and gut to control the risk of <b>visible</b> <b>parasites,</b> thus ensuring that no 24 contaminated fish reach the consumers. The accuracy of the above visual inspection method should fall 25 on a well-tested statistical significance {{between the number of}} observable parasites in the abdominal 26 cavity and the number of parasites in the edible part of the fish (i. e., musculature). The aim of this study 27 was to analyse this statistical significance, and the efficacy of the washing practice to remove Anisakis 28 spp. from gut. To carry out this work, 322 fresh individuals of Micromesistius poutassou and 230 of 29 Scomber scombrus were necropsied within 12 hours and 48 hours post-capture. Then, descriptive 30 statistics, correlation and regression analyses were used to evaluate the significant statistical relationship 31 between the number of anisakid larvae found in the gut and musculature of both fish species. 32 Additionally, livers and gonads of 25 fresh specimens of Merluccius merluccius were vigorously washed 33 under tap water, and examined under stereomicroscope looking for Anisakis spp. larvae. Results 34 evidenced the low efficiency of visual inspection of gut parasites as a commonly recommended method 35 for predicting nematode larvae in the flesh of fish. Therefore, a direct-invasive inspection of musculature 36 is stressed as the only criteria with scientific merit for accurately detecting contaminated fishes by 37 anisakids. Moreover, fresh European hake liver and gonads showed at least one larva remained inside the 38 tissue after washing vigorously under tap water. Results suggested that critical control points at Hazard 39 Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) programmes should be reviewed to improve the risk of 40 anisakid-induced allergies and gastrointestinal anisakiasis among consumers.

40|$|Trichomonas vaginalis, a {{flagellate}} protozoan parasite {{commonly found}} in the human genitourinary tract, is transmitted primarily by sexual intercourse. Diagnosis is usually by in vitro culture method and staining with Giemsa stain. There are laboratories that use Gram stain as well. We compared the use of modified Field's (MF), Giemsa, and Gram stains on 2 axenic and xenic isolates of T. vaginalis, respectively. Three smears from every sediment of spun cultures of all 4 isolates were stained, respectively, {{with each of the}} stains. We showed that MF staining, apart from being a rapid stain (20 s), confers sharper staining contrast, which differentiates the nucleus and the cytoplasm of the organism when compared to Giemsa and Gram staining especially on parasites from spiked urine samples. The alternative staining procedure offers in a diagnostic setting a rapid stain that can easily visualize the parasite with sharp contrasting characteristics between organelles especially the nucleus and cytoplasm. Vacuoles are more clearly <b>visible</b> in <b>parasites</b> stained with MF than when stained with Giemsa. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Toxoplasma gondii {{infection}} causes toxoplasmosis, {{an infectious}} disease with worldwide prevalence. The limited efficiency of drugs against this infection, their {{side effects and}} the potential appearance of resistant strains make the search of novel drugs an essential need. We examined Eurycoma longifolia root extract and fractions as potential sources of new compounds with high activity and low toxicity. The main goal {{of this study was}} to investigate the anti- T. gondii activity of crude extract (TACME) and four fractions (TAF 273, TAF 355, TAF 191 and TAF 401) from E. longifolia, with clindamycin as the positive control. Methods In vitro toxoplasmacidal evaluation was performed using Vero cells as host for T. gondii. Light microscopy technique was used to study in situ antiparasitic activity. Results Significant anti- T. gondii activity was observed with clindamycin (EC 50 [*]=[*] 0. 016 μg/ml), follow by TAF 355 (EC 50 [*]=[*] 0. 369 μg/ml) and TAF 401 (EC 50 [*]=[*] 0. 882 μg/ml). Light microscopy revealed that most Vero cells were infected after 3 h of exposure to T. gondii. After 36 h of exposure to the E. longifolia fraction, the host Vero cells showed no <b>visible</b> intracellular <b>parasite</b> and no remarkable morphological changes. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that TAF 355 and TAF 401 fractions may be the sources of new anti- T. gondii compounds. </p...|$|R
40|$|Local {{cellular}} {{responses to}} cutaneous infection with Leishmania mexicana amazonensis {{were examined in}} susceptible (BALB/c) and resistant (C 57 BL/ 6) mouse strains by immunocytochemical and electron microscopic studies. Infection during the first 8 wk in both animal strains was characterized by progressively enlarging lesions, epidermal thickening and ulceration, and accumulation of eosinophils and Ia+ infected macrophages. Healing of C 57 BL/ 6 mouse lesions began after 12 wk of infection and was associated with local influx of both Th (L 3 T 4 +) and T cytotoxic/suppressor (Lyt- 2 +) cells into the dermis, and Ia antigen expression on epidermal keratinocytes. T lymphocyte infiltration was marked and intracellular parasites were scarce by 21 wk of C 57 BL/ 6 infection. Similarly, granulomas in C 57 BL/ 6 livers contained L 3 T 4 + and Lyt- 2 + T lymphocytes and no <b>visible</b> intracellular <b>parasites</b> by 21 wk of infection. In contrast, BALB/c mouse lesions continued to enlarge and never healed. Throughout the entire course of infection, T lymphocyte influx into the heavily infected dermis was minimal. Keratinocyte Ia expression was absent in BALB/c lesions. BALB/c livers were heavily infected by 18 wk of cutaneous infection, with few demonstrable T lymphocytes. A systemic absence of T cells could not be demonstrated in BALB/c mice. Both L 3 T 4 + and Lyt- 2 + T cells {{were found in the}} peripheral blood in normal numbers in both mouse strains. Our results support the role of T cells as important local effector cells in the healing response of murine cutaneous leishmaniasis. We suggest that local T lymphocyte infiltration may provide lymphokines, particularly IFN-gamma, that can activate infected macrophages to destroy the intracellular parasites. Alternatively, T cells may play a cytotoxic role, killing infected macrophages and allowing local humoral factors to destroy released extracellular parasites...|$|R

40|$|Fungi {{that are}} {{unrelated}} to the mycobiont species frequently colonize lichens. Some of these fungal colonists are described lichenicolous fungi, lichen parasites and pathogens that produce recognizable morphological characters, while others apparently produce no noticeable structures. Here we apply the single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique to directly assess the abundance of different fungi in lichens. Twenty-eight lichen thalli were chosen, some with and some without externally <b>visible</b> symptoms of <b>parasite</b> infection, and these were subjected to total DNA extraction. PCR was conducted with fungal-specific primers for the ITS region of ribosomal DNA. Single strands of the products were separated on native acrylamide gels. The majority of lichen specimens, both infected and those without symptoms, displayed more than one band in the stained gels. In one case, 14 bands were detected using SSCP. Some of these bands apparently represent other neighbouring lichens in the habitat, but many are apparently non-lichen-forming. Since few lichenassociated fungi have been cultured and sequenced, {{it is difficult to}} know if SSCP bands represent obligate lichenicolous fungi, other asymptomatic lichen parasites, or fungi not obligately associated with lichens, but our results indicate that large numbers of non-lichen-forming fungi commonly co-occur with lichens in nature. For specimens of the filamentous lichens Cystocoleus ebeneus and Racodium rupestre we used cloned sequences to compare the number of sequences obtained by the SSCP method to the number obtained by direct sequencing of thallus extracts, and we generally found that more sequences could be detected by SSCP than could be seen by direct sequencing...|$|R
40|$|Background: Primates are {{important}} reservoirs for human diseases, but their infection status and disease dynamics {{are difficult to}} track in the wild. Within the last decade, a macaque malaria, Plasmodium knowlesi, has caused disease in hundreds of humans in Southeast Asia. In order to track cases and understand zoonotic risk, {{it is imperative to}} be able to quantify infection status in reservoir macaque species. In this study, protocols for the collection of non-invasive samples and isolation of malaria parasites from naturally infected macaques are optimized. Methods: Paired faecal and blood samples from 60 Macaca fascicularis and four Macaca nemestrina were collected. All animals came from Sumatra or Java and were housed in semi-captive breeding colonies around West Java. DNA was extracted from samples using a modified protocol. Nested polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were run to detect Plasmodium using primers targeting mitochondrial DNA. Sensitivity of screening faecal samples for Plasmodium was compared to other studies using Kruskal Wallis tests and logistic regression models. Results: The best primer set was 96. 7 % (95 % confidence intervals (CI) : 83. 3 – 99. 4 %) sensitive for detecting Plasmo-dium in faecal samples of naturally infected macaques (n = 30). This is the first study to produce definitive estimates of Plasmodium sensitivity and specificity in faecal samples from naturally infected hosts. The sensitivity was signifi-cantly higher than some other studies involving wild primates. Conclusions: Faecal samples can be used for detection of malaria infection in field surveys of macaques, even when there are no <b>parasites</b> <b>visible</b> in thin blood smears. Repeating samples from individuals will improve inferences of the epidemiology of malaria in wild primates...|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the ICON project (Integrated Assessment of Contaminant Impacts on the North Sea), common dab (Limanda limanda) from seven offshore sampling areas in the North Sea, Icelandic waters and the western Baltic Sea were examined in 2008 for the presence of externally <b>visible</b> diseases and <b>parasites</b> (EVD), macroscopic liver neoplasms (tumours) (MLN) and histopathological liver lesions (LH). Methodologies applied followed standardised ICES and BEQUALM protocols. The EDV results revealed pronounced spatial variation, with dab from the central and northern North Sea sampling areas showing the highest disease prevalence. MLN were recorded only in North Sea dab from the German Bight, Firth of Forth and Ekofisk at a low prevalence. LH results revealed a dominant prevalence of non-specific, mostly inflammatory, lesions and a low prevalence of early toxicopathic non-neoplastic lesions, tumour pre-stages (foci of cellular alteration) and liver tumours. For the analysis and assessment of spatial variation of EVD, a Fish Disease Index (FDI) was calculated for individual dab, summarising data on the presence/absence of EDV, their severity grades, effects on the host and compensating for effects of length, sex and season. FDI data confirmed that the health status of North Sea dab from the offshore areas Dogger Bank, Ekofisk and Firth of Forth was significantly worse than in dab from the German Bight, Icelandic areas and the western Baltic Sea. An assessment of the disease data following ICES/OSPAR criteria was accomplished by applying established numeric background (BAC) and ecological assessment criteria (EAC) for EDV, MLN and LH. The combined assessment of the three disease categories indicated that health effects classified as unacceptable were rare and mainly affected dab from the North Sea. Based on the findings of the present study, it is recommended to monitor wild fish diseases in the context of assessing the impact of hazardous substances and other stressors on the marine environment.
