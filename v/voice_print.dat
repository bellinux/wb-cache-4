This information was verified and confirmed on the same day by a German newspaper. Unnamed American intelligence officials stated that sensors that traced the path of the missile, shrapnel patterns in the wreckage, <b>voice</b> <b>print</b> analysis of separatists' conversations in which they claimed credit for the strike, and photos and other data from social media sites all indicated that Russian-backed separatists had fired the missile.|$|E
5000|$|Each speaker {{recognition}} {{system has}} two phases: Enrollment and verification. During enrollment, the speaker's voice is recorded and typically {{a number of}} features are extracted to form a <b>voice</b> <b>print,</b> template, or model. In the verification phase, a speech sample or [...] "utterance" [...] is compared against a previously created <b>voice</b> <b>print.</b> For identification systems, the utterance is compared against multiple voice prints {{in order to determine}} the best match(es) while verification systems compare an utterance against a single <b>voice</b> <b>print.</b> Because of the process involved, verification is faster than identification.|$|E

50|$|In {{biometric}} security systems, capture is {{the acquisition of}} or the process of acquiring and identifying characteristics such as finger image, palm image, facial image, iris print or <b>voice</b> <b>print</b> which involves audio data and the rest all involves video data.|$|E
50|$|As {{biometrics}} {{become more}} and more prominent as a recognized means of positive identification, their use in security systems increases.

5000|$|Speaker {{recognition}} {{is a pattern}} recognition problem. The various technologies used to process and store <b>voice</b> <b>prints</b> include frequency estimation, hidden Markov models, Gaussian mixture models, pattern matching algorithms, neural networks, matrix representation, Vector Quantization and decision trees. Some systems also use [...] "anti-speaker" [...] techniques, such as cohort models, and world models. Spectral features are predominantly used in representing speaker characteristics.|$|R
50|$|Biometric {{authentication}} authenticates individuals {{by identifying}} their physiological or behavioral characteristic. The physiological features include {{but are not}} limited to fingerprint, hand geometry, retina scan, iris Scan, signature dynamics, keyboard dynamics, <b>voice</b> <b>print,</b> and facial scan. The most widely used biometric authentication nowadays is the fingerprint method.|$|E

50|$|Call centers use IVR {{systems to}} {{identify}} and segment callers. The ability to identify customers allows services to be tailored according to the customer profile. The caller can be given the option {{to wait in the}} queue, choose an automated service, or request a callback. The system may obtain caller line identification (CLI) data from the network to help identify or authenticate the caller. Additional caller authentication data could include account number, personal information, password and biometrics (such as <b>voice</b> <b>print).</b> IVR also enables customer prioritization. In a system wherein individual customers may have a different status, the service will automatically prioritize the individual's call and move customers to the front of a specific queue.|$|E
50|$|Spock and Chief Medical Officer Leonard McCoy confront Captain Kirk with Spock's {{evidence}} and Spock's concern that assassination attempts {{will be made}} on Lt. Riley and Captain Kirk. Kirk confesses that he is unsure if Karidian is Kodos and he is unwilling to make such an accusation without proof. A further complicating factor is that Kirk has started {{falling in love with}} Lenore. However, after Riley is poisoned and left in a coma, and the ship is almost damaged by an overloading phaser left in Kirk's quarters, Kirk decides to confront Karidian by having him read the sentence Kodos pronounced before each execution so that he can compare Karidian's <b>voice</b> <b>print</b> with that of Kodos stored in the computer. Even after he obtains a near match, however, Kirk is still unwilling to make such a damning accusation.|$|E

After confirming his <b>voice</b> <b>print,</b> retina scan and blood DNA sample, the security computer grants him access.

He congratulates the Trell on their work and prepares to fulfil his lifelong vision, but then they’re interrupted by news that the incoming spacecraft is about to land. Zarodnix doesn’t care and gives the Trell permission to arrest the occupants or kill them, whatever they prefer. Aboard Haspira’s ship, Rosto informs Straxus that they’re about to land, but the Time Lord panics and insists that the Marshal take them back up into space. Unfortunately none of the controls are working and it’s not long before the ship settles on the surface. Straxus appears genuinely terrified and Rosto can’t understand why he’s so frightened.|$|E
