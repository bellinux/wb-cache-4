50|$|Volunteers at KUNM {{have played}} a central role in the {{functioning}} of the station over the years. In 1987 recently hired Station Manager Tim Singleton made it known that the station's Morning and Afternoon Freeform programs were to be replaced with more standard NPR-style jazz and classical programming, including nationally-syndicated programming produced outside of New Mexico. The response of the volunteers was an 18-month strike, with strong community support, and accompanying first amendment and other legal actions against the University of New Mexico. A settlement was reached in the Fall of 1988, that included a re-vamped Radio Board with a significant amount of say on programming changes, and a <b>Volunteer</b> <b>Agreement</b> that clarifies <b>volunteer</b> rights at the station.|$|R

5000|$|The clock bells ring every {{quarter of}} an hour during the daytime and Great Peter strikes the hour. The change ringing bells are not {{currently}} rung, following the termination of the ringers' <b>volunteer</b> <b>agreements</b> in October 2016. York Minster became the first cathedral in England to have a carillon of bells with the arrival of a further twenty-four small bells on 4 April 2008. These are added to the existing [...] "Nelson Chime" [...] which is chimed to announce Evensong around 5.00 pm each day, giving a carillon of 35 bells in total (three chromatic octaves). The new bells were cast at the Loughborough Bell Foundry of John Taylor & Co, where all of the existing minster bells were cast. The new carillon is a gift to the minster. It will be the first new carillon in the British Isles for 40 years and first hand played carillon in an English cathedral. Before Evensong each evening, hymn tunes are played on a baton keyboard connected with the bells, but occasionally anything from Beethoven to the Beatles may be heard.|$|R
40|$|The Clark County {{stewardship}} database is {{the only}} one of its kind among all Nevada counties. Funding for this database from Clark County is vital to maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of Clark County cultural resources. Two programmers were hired to design and implement a relational database for the CSSP. During this quarter, a system was designed in ACCESS and has accomplished the following: • Store personnel information and required documentation on volunteer site stewards. Names of all 3 52 stewards were inputted and fully populate the database. Ethics Statements and <b>Volunteer</b> <b>Agreements</b> unique to each steward are recorded. • House confidential archaeological site information such as site type, location, and archaeological data for each site that may benefit scientific understanding of Clark County history and prehistory. All site monitoring units (several hundred) were input. Site Monitoring Reports, Impact Reports and pertinent site data gathered from October 1, 2007 through the present are added. Addition of all reports and data obtained from September 30, 2007 back to December, 2004 when the CSSP was implemented are currently under way. • Planned queries and reports specific to agency needs are being developed...|$|R

40|$|Objectives – Interviews with {{library staff}} and volunteers were {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the use}} of volunteers in UK public libraries via a case study of the Walter Gardiner Photographic Project, a digitisation project based in Worthing Library, to inform future guidelines on volunteer usage and to make recommendations to existing practice. Methods – Fourteen semi-structured interviews were carried out to explore the perceptions and experiences of both staff and volunteers of the project. All interviews were fully transcribed and then coded to identify emergent themes. Results – Key positives for volunteers were professional training, good time management and organization by staff, the friendliness and approachability of staff, and the informal nature of the volunteering. Enjoyment of the work and forming close relationships with others were key motivating factors. For staff, the completion of work which would have otherwise been impossible was the most positive outcome. Problem areas identified by volunteers were lack of contact time with project staff and feeling isolated from other library staff. For project staff, a lack of professionalism on behalf of some volunteers was the primary negative. Key issues to emerge were the need {{to strike a balance between}} formal and informal management, the need for good integration between the volunteers and host organization, and the importance of acknowledging the nature of the voluntary commitment. Conclusions – The project proved overall to be a successful example of using volunteers in public library projects with good examples of volunteer recruitment, training, and management being demonstrated. Areas of conflict that did arise stemmed from differing expectations of levels of service between staff and volunteers. Clarification on these expectations through a written <b>volunteer</b> <b>agreement</b> is advocated for further projects...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objectives}} of the project were to assess heavy metal flows on livestock farms {{and to develop a}} strategy to reduce heavy metal inputs into animal manures. For the experiments 20 farms with animal husbandry in various regions of Germany were selected. On the farms the inputs and outputs of the elements copper and zinc, as well as lead, cadmium, chromium and nickel were balanced at the stable level. The effect of abatement measures was evaluated using a calculation tool for stable balances. It is shown, the main input pathways for heavy metals into animal manures are, apart from copper disinfectants, feeding stuffs and feed supplements. Home grown feeds are the major source of heavy metal input into the stable because they are fed in large quantities. However, the heavy metal content of the home grown feeds in particular of roughages for ruminants is low. Purchased feed stuffs (supplementary feeding stuffs and complete feeding stuffs) were found to have a higher content of heavy metals (due to supplementation with trace elements) compared to home grown feeds. Thus, pig and poultry husbandry rather than ruminant husbandry is susceptible to heavy metal accumulation of manures. Heavy metals are cycling within the farm which is of importance when discussing the environmental impact. The turnover within the farm can hardly be controlled by the farmer. Thus, effective strategies have to be targeted at the inputs, e. g. the purchased feed stuffs. A main option to reduce the heavy metal input is to lower the trace element concentrations in supplementary feed stuffs either by legislation of maximum threshold values (e. g. EG 1334 / 2003) or by <b>volunteer</b> <b>agreements</b> of the feed industry and agriculture. In addition, the absorption of copper and zinc by the animals should be improved using better absorbable trace element compounds and phytase. (orig.)

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to examine the type of activities as well as the challenges faced by befrienders supporting persons with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Twenty-nine volunteers befriending an equal number of families with children with ASD participated in this study. Content analysis was applied on visit logs (n = 465) completed by befrienders during a nine month period, supplemented by thematically analysed evidence derived from semi-structured interviews with befrienders {{at the end of their}} <b>volunteering</b> experience. In <b>agreement</b> with our expectations, findings indicate a variation in the type, number and location of activities as well as the challenges of befrienders, depending on the level of ability of persons with ASD. Befrienders in both groups were mostly involved in leisure activities, had greater social interaction with the high functioning autistic group and carried out more structured 1 : 1 activities with individuas with low functioning autism. Interestingly, befrienders in both groups did not differ significantly on their reported challenges. The implications of this befriending service as a means of social support for families with persons with ASD are discussed...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{diagnosis}} of subacute subarachnoid hemorrhage {{is important because}} rebleeding may occur with subsequent life-threatening hemorrhage. Our aim {{was to determine the}} sensitivity of the 3 D double inversion recovery sequence compared with CT, 2 D and 3 D FLAIR, 2 D T 2 *, and 3 D SWI sequences for the detection of subacute SAH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 25 patients with a CT-proved acute SAH. Brain imaging was repeated between days 14 and 16 (mean, 14. 75 days) after clinical onset and included MR imaging (2 D and 3 D FLAIR, 2 D T 2 *, SWI, and 3 D double inversion recovery) after CT (median delay, 3 hours; range, 2 – 5 hours). A control group of 20 healthy volunteers was used for comparison. MR images and CT scans were analyzed independently in a randomized order by 3 blinded readers. For each subject, {{the presence or absence of}} hemorrhage was assessed in 4 subarachnoid areas (basal cisterns, Sylvian fissures, interhemispheric fissure, and convexity) and in brain ventricles. The {{diagnosis of}} subacute SAH was defined by the presence of at least 1 subarachnoid area with hemorrhage. RESULTS: For the diagnosis of subacute SAH, the double inversion recovery sequence had a higher sensitivity comparedwith CT (P. 001), 2 D FLAIR (P. 005), T 2 * (P. 02), SWI, and 3 D FLAIR (P. 03) sequences. Hemorrhage was present for all patients in the interhemispheric fissure on double inversion recovery images, while no signal abnormality was noted in healthy <b>volunteers.</b> Interobserver <b>agreement</b> was excellent with double inversion recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the double inversion recovery sequence has a higher sensitivity for the detection of subacut...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy {{may result}} in dryness of the skin even when no other change can be detected. We {{describe}} a system for recording the electrical conductance of skin {{as a measure of}} sweat gland function. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 22 normal <b>volunteers</b> close <b>agreement</b> was obtained between measurements obtained from comparable sites {{on both sides of the}} chest. Measurements were subsequently made in 38 patients treated by radiotherapy to one side of the chest for tumours of the breast or lung using one of five different fractionation schedules. Simultaneous readings were obtained from both sides of the chest with the non irradiated side acting as a control. RESULTS: A dose response relationship was demonstrated: five patients who received the equivalent total dose of 15 Gy in 2 -Gy fractions showed no change in conductance. Sixteen out of 23 who received an equivalent total dose of 42 - 46 Gy in 2 -Gy fractions had a greater than 22 % reduction in mean skin conductance compared with that of the control areas despite the skin appearing normal in the large majority. Marked changes in skin conductance were seen after higher total doses. In a prospective study 18 women receiving breast irradiation underwent weekly readings during treatment. A mean reduction of 40 % in skin conductance was noted by the end of the second week of treatment prior to any clinical evidence of radiation change. Skin conductance returned to normal in 44 % of patients by 6 months. In the remainder, those patients who showed the greatest reduction in skin conductance during treatment demonstrated the least recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in sweat gland function can be detected and quantified in skin which may otherwise appear normal. Differences may so be demonstrated between areas treated using different fractionation schedules and the method may be applied to the detection during radiotherapy of unusually sensitive patient...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{accuracy and}} noise properties {{of a novel}} time-resolved, three-dimensional, three-directional phase contrast sequence with variable velocity encoding (denoted 4 D-vPC) on a 3 Tesla MR system, and to investigate potential benefits and limitations of variable velocity encoding with respect to depicting blood flow patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 4 D PC-MRI sequence was modified to allow variable velocity encoding (VENC) over the cardiac cycle in all three velocity directions independently. 4 D-PC sequences with constant and variable VENC were compared in a rotating phantom with respect to measured velocities and noise levels. Additionally, comparison of flow patterns in the ascending aorta was performed in six healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Phantom measurements showed a linear relationship between velocity noise and velocity encoding. 4 D-vPC MRI presented lower noise levels than 4 D-PC both in phantom and in <b>volunteer</b> measurements, in <b>agreement</b> with theory. <b>Volunteer</b> comparisons revealed more consistent and detailed flow patterns in early diastole for the variable VENC sequences. CONCLUSION: Variable velocity encoding offers reduced noise levels compared with sequences with constant velocity encoding by optimizing the velocity-to-noise ratio (VNR) to the hemodynamic properties of the imaged area. Increased VNR ratios could be beneficial for blood flow visualizations of pathology in the cardiac cycle. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Government-trained health {{promotion}} volunteers are {{a type of}} community-based health organization in Japan. This study aimed to develop a scale to measure the degree of support from public health nurses to promote {{health promotion}} volunteer autonomy (support scale). A cross-sectional study was conducted. Among public health nurses working in 19 municipalities with health promotion volunteers in Niigata Prefecture, a total of 200 supporting health promotion volunteers {{at the time of}} the study were studied. The measurements of this study were as follows: Public health nurse attributes; details of their support to promote health promotion volunteer autonomy; their attitudes toward health promotion volunteer training; and levels of health promotion volunteer autonomy with such support. The number (rate) of valid responses was 140 (70. 0 %). As a result of factor analysis, a support scale consisting of the following 4 factors and 31 items was developed: “support to promote health promotion volunteers’ communication with the government and community”; “support to enhance the significance and joyfulness of health promotion volunteer activities”; “Support to increase awareness, knowledge and skills of self-directed activities”; and “the provision of a basis for health promotion <b>volunteer</b> activities and <b>agreement</b> with superiors and colleagues”. Its validity and reliability were confirmed in each factor overall. The validity and reliability of the support scale developed in the study were generally favorable; therefore, it is likely to be sufficiently applicable...|$|R
