40|$|As {{a result}} of a study {{conducted}} concerning the guidance in the exercises by using the <b>vaulting</b> <b>box,</b> with junior high school students as objects, the following conclusions were obtained. 1. In the case {{of the students in the}} first and second year grades, the height of the <b>vaulting</b> <b>box</b> was most appropriate at 90 cm. In the case of the third year grade students, the successful rate was found highest, when the <b>vaulting</b> <b>box</b> was as high as 105 cm. In respect to the distance between the <b>vaulting</b> <b>box</b> and the beatboard, 30 cm, as compared with 70 cm, was found to bring a higher success. 2. In regard to the physical conditions of the examinees, the successful group displayed particularly higher values in the 50 m run, vertical jumping and the back muscular strength than those of the unsuccessful group. 3. In point of the techniques involved, the following findings became apparent. (1) The successful group had a slightly faster speed in the preliminary run and steps, as compared with that of the unsuccessful group, while in reference to jumping, the result was quite the contrary. (2) While the successful group was noticed to be able to raise the center of gravity when stepping, the unsuccessful group did not show that they were able to do it. (3) The respective differences shown in the angles formed by the beatboard and the body at the time of arriving at and leaving the beatboard were seen to be less in value with the successful group as compared with those manifested by the unsuccessful group...|$|E

50|$|Located {{northwest}} of Pompeii, Boscoreale was {{the location of}} a large Roman villa, the Villa della Pisanella, that was buried by volcanic ash following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. The villa was unearthed during several archaeological seasons, confirming the hypothesis of a villa rustica covering 1000 square metres with clearly defined residential sector and farm buildings. The villa was discovered in 1876, but it was only on April 13 1895 that the remains of a <b>vaulted</b> <b>box</b> containing the treasure was discovered in the wine-pressing room of the villa. The box contained silver tableware consisting of 102 items and a leather bag full of coins to the value of a thousand gold aurei.

2500|$|During the {{approach}} the pole vaulter sprints {{down the runway}} {{in such a way}} as to achieve maximum speed and correct position to initiate takeoff at the end of {{the approach}}. Top class vaulters use approaches with 18 to 22 strides, often referred to as a [...] "step" [...] in which every other foot is counted as one step. The run-up to the vaulting pit begins forcefully with the vaulter running powerfully in a relaxed, upright position with knees lifted and torso leaning very slightly forward. The head, shoulders and hips are aligned, the vaulter increasing speed as the body becomes erect. The tip of the vaulting pole is angled higher than eye level until three paces from takeoff, when the pole tip descends efficiently, amplifying run speed as the pole is planted into the <b>vault</b> <b>box.</b> The faster the vaulter can run and the more efficient their take-off is, the greater the kinetic energy that can be achieved and used during the vault.|$|R

50|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the gazebo was gone. Later, during the 1970s, the park underwent a $60,000 restoration. New trees, flowers, and shrubs were planted. New lights crafted to look like antique gas lamps were placed in the park. A new steel 3/4 size replica of the original gazebo built by Bradley Iron Works was placed on the site. This restoration was made possible by the Dubuque Jaycees who made a large financial contribution to the City of Dubuque. Also the Dubuque Jaycees had put together a time capsule using a donated grave <b>vault.</b> <b>Boxes</b> were handed out to the public who were asked to place items in the boxes and return to the Park when they would be placed in the time capsule. Once the <b>boxes</b> filled the <b>vault</b> it was sealed and buried right next to the southern side of the gazebo under the rock with the plaque that explains it is not to be opened for 100 years. That opening is set for the year 2076.|$|R

50|$|Owen {{was led to}} {{the belief}} that {{original}} manuscripts were hidden in iron boxes buried beneath or close to the River Wye at Chepstow Castle. After a fruitless search in caves near the castle in September 1909, he returned late the following year and excavated the river bed a few hundred yards above the castle in the belief that a rift in the river bed held a vault containing 66 lead-lined boxes. The search attracted widespread media interest, and up to 24 men were employed to dig out the mud and shore up the sides.

40|$|Today in the United States, {{virtually}} every commercial bank makes safe deposit services {{available for a}} small fee, either through a department of the bank or through a subsidiary or affiliated safe deposit company. Never before has the demand for safe deposit services been so great. More than ever before, Americans are turning to safe deposit companies and bank safe deposit vaults for the storage of their assets. This increased demand has caused increased concern among legislators and bankers about whether to regulate further the day-to-day affairs of the safe deposit business. Increased use of safe deposit <b>vaults</b> and <b>boxes</b> will predictably lead to more litigation concerning the rights and responsibilities of banks and their customers. It is therefore important to examine {{the legal status of}} the relationship of the bank to its safe deposit customer.

50|$|The {{causes of}} an {{elevation}} of the intracranial pressure are best understood using the Monro-Kellie doctrine. The Monro-Kellie doctrine reduces the cranial <b>vault</b> to a <b>box</b> with rigid walls. This box contains three elements: brain, intracranial blood and cerebrospinal fluid. The sum of volumes of these three elements is constant. An increase in one should cause a decrease in {{one or both of}} the remaining two, thereby preventing {{an elevation of}} the intracranial pressure.A compensatory mechanism involves the movement of cerebrospinal fluid from the cranial vault towards the spinal cord. The volume of blood in the cranial vault is auto-regulated by the brain, and will therefore not decrease that easily.|$|R
50|$|A safe deposit box, {{sometimes}} known erroneously as {{a safety}} deposit box, is an individually secured container, usually held within a larger safe or bank <b>vault.</b> Safe deposit <b>boxes</b> are generally located in banks, post offices or other institutions. Safe deposit boxes are used to store valuable possessions, such as gemstones, precious metals, currency, marketable securities, important documents (e.g. wills, property deeds, or birth certificates), or computer data, that need protection from theft, fire, flood, tampering, or other perils. In the United States, neither banks nor the FDIC insure the contents. An individual can purchase insurance for the safe deposit box in order to cover e.g. theft, fire, flooding or terrorist attacks.|$|R

40|$|Juno, a NASA New Frontiers mission, {{plans for}} launch in August 2011, a 5 -year cruise (including a flyby of Earth in October 2013 for a gravity boost), and 14 months around Jupiter after {{arriving}} in August 2016. The spinning (2 RPM), solar-powered Juno will study Jupiter from a highly elliptical orbit, in which the spacecraft (for about 6 hours once every 11 days) dives down over the north pole, skims the outermost atmosphere, and rises back up over the south pole. This orbit allows Juno avoid most of the intense particle radiation surrounding the planet and provides an excellent platform for investigating Jupiter's polar magnetosphere. Part of the exploration of Jupiter's polar magnetosphere will involve remote sensing of the far-ultraviolet H and H 2 auroral emissions, plus gases such as methane and acetylene which add their absorption signature to the H 2 emissions. This hydrocarbon absorption {{can be used to}} estimate the energy of the precipitating electrons; since more energetic electrons penetrate deeper into the atmosphere and the UV emissions they produce will show more absorption. Juno will carry an Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) to make spectral images of Jupiter's aurora. UVS is a UV imaging spectrograph sensitive to both extreme and far ultraviolet emissions in the 70 - 205 ~nm range that will characterize the morphology and spectral nature of Jupiter's auroral emissions. Juno UVS consists of two separate sections: a dedicated telescope/spectrograph assembly and a <b>vault</b> electronics <b>box.</b> The telescope/spectrograph assembly contains a telescope which feeds a 0. 15 -m Rowland circle spectrograph. The telescope has an input aperture 40 Ã 40 ~mm 2 and uses an off-axis parabolic primary mirror. A flat scan mirror situated at {{the front end of the}} telescope (used to target specific auroral features at up to Â± 30 Â° perpendicular to the Juno spin plane) directs incoming light to the primary. The light is then focused onto the spectrograph entrance slit, which has a 'dog- bone' shape 6 Â° long, in three 2 Â° sections of 0. 2 Â°, 0. 05 Â°, and 0. 2 Â° width (projected onto the sky). Light entering the slit is dispersed by a toroidal grating which focuses the UV bandpass onto a curved microchannel plate (MCP) cross delay line (XDL) detector with a solar blind UV- sensitive CsI photocathode, which makes up the instrument's focal plane. Tantalum shielding surrounds the detector assembly to protect the detector and the adjacent detector electronics from high-energy electrons. The main electronics box is located in the Juno vault. Inside are two redundant high-voltage power supplies (HVPS), two redundant low-voltage power supplies, the command and data handling (C&DH) electronics, heater/actuator activation electronics, scan mirror electronics, and event processing electronics. An overview of the UVS design and scientific performance will be presented...|$|R
