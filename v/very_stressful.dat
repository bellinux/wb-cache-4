Defeating a stage's boss will earn the player its special weapon, which can be selected and used at will {{throughout the rest of}} the game. Mega Man 3 introduces new gameplay elements such as Mega Man's canine sidekick Rush and the ability to slide along the ground. Unlike with the first two installments of the series, artist and designer Keiji Inafune has considered the creation of Mega Man 3 to be <b>very</b> <b>stressful</b> due to time constraints and his own increased responsibilities during its development.|$|E

However, the Chavchavadze family suffered another devastating blow when Ilia's brother, Constantine, was killed during the Dagestani raid on Kakheti. Ilia expressed his anguish and grief in one of his first short-poems called Sorrow of a Poor Man. In addition to his personal problems, the political situation in Georgia worsened under the harsh authority of the Russian Empire, which played a destructive role to the nation and its culture.|$|E

He also said there were times when he and the crew had just three hours of sleep in four days, but however pointed out that he had best hands on deck for the project and he is grateful for that. The film production team on set was made up of about a hundred people; Co-ordinator, Oge Ogu noted that one of the major challenges during filming was co-ordinating and managing the extras to fit into the director's vision, as the crowd often span into hundreds of people.|$|E

Michelle Frey, executive editor at Knopf, contacted Paolini {{and his family}} to ask if they were interested in having Knopf publish Eragon.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] was filmed in Los Angeles and {{directed}} by Wendy Morgan, who Roberts described as [...] "focused and passionate". The singer continued to say that because of this, she felt comfortable with her immediately. The music video and production was featured on the Through Nicola's Eyes webisodes, in which Roberts stated that she found {{the production of the}} music video <b>very</b> <b>stressful.</b> Talking about the experience in an interview with MTV News, Roberts stated that [...] "I'm nervous and I'm dreading the night before... I know I'm going to be like losing half a stone in weight overnight, so I'm {{going to have to get}} myself into the zone." [...] Roberts attributed her stress on the set of the video to her time with Girls Aloud, as she had always recorded music videos with four other members; this was the first time she had performed on her own. This meant that critical responses would only be aimed only at her. During the video shoot, Roberts further discussed the anxiety of a solo career claiming pressure from Morgan was making her feel uncomfortable. During the production, Roberts feared that feeling uncomfortable whilst shooting could have an overall negative effect on the video, explaining [...] "You've got to be strong and be professional and get through it, obviously enjoy it, but if you feel uncomfortable, you can't look uncomfortable otherwise it's not going to work".|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} 2000s Pryce starred {{and participated in}} a variety of movies, such as The Affair of the Necklace (2001), Unconditional Love (2002), What a Girl Wants (2003), and Terry Gilliam's aborted project, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote. While the success of some of these films was variable, the 2001 London stage {{production}} of My Fair Lady and his portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins was acclaimed by observers. This production turned out to be <b>very</b> <b>stressful</b> for Pryce because Martine McCutcheon, who portrayed Eliza Doolittle, was sick during much of the show's run. McCutcheon was replaced by her understudy Alexandra Jay, who would also fall sick hours before a performance, forcing her understudy, Kerry Ellis, to take the lead. Pryce was understandably upset and on her first night introduced Ellis to the audience before the show by saying [...] "This will be your first Eliza, my second today and my third this week. Any member of the audience interested in playing Eliza can find applications at the door. Wednesday and Saturday matinee available." [...] Pryce ended up dealing with four Elizas during the course of 14 months. Despite the difficulty, the show was nominated for four Laurence Olivier Awards on 2001: Best Actress in a Musical for Martine McCutcheon, Outstanding Musical Production, Best Theatre Choreographer and Best Actor in a Musical for Pryce. Pryce lost to Philip Quast, although ironically McCutcheon won in her category having played fewer performances than any of her understudies. Pryce did express interest in doing My Fair Lady in New York, but when asked if he would do it with McCutcheon he said that [...] "there's as much chance of me getting a date with Julia Roberts as doing My Fair Lady in New York with Martine McCutcheon." ...|$|E

40|$|Trends within midlife {{professionals}} suggest {{individuals are}} increasingly seeking opportunities for career transitions, {{and are often}} searching for careers that are more intrinsically motivated, individually meaningful and self-congruent.

The traditional approach to career transition is based on a competence framework either focusing on retraining or applying transferrable skills. This approach might not be most appropriate for corporate professionals over the age of 35. A strength-based approach is therefore being proposed in this paper as an alternative approach. Phenomenological research involving six professionals between the ages of 35 - 54 who have gone through the midlife career transition will be utilised to identify common experiences, and investigate what role strengths may play in managing ones career transition...|$|R

These guidelines are ideally aimed at improving safety and reducing fatigue at work, but also the overall lifestyle of employees. In some cases, physical changes in the work environment also followed these studies, including changes in the design of signal box lighting, seating and signalling equipment.|$|R

40|$|For {{people that}} end up {{developing}} dementia {{it can be a}} <b>very</b> debilitating, <b>stressful</b> and isolating experience not just for themselves but also for their family and friends. Dementia results in a decline in memory as well as language, perception, personality and cognitive skills. 1, 2 Many people who develop dementia end up in long-term care facilities, as they often require high-level care that can no longer be provided by family and friends. This is predominately due to behaviours such as verbal and physical aggression, agitation, vocalisations and wandering. Commonly coined challenging behaviours, behaviours of concern, behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) or need driven behaviours, such behaviours can lead to injuries to the afflicted resident, other residents, staff and family. With population ageing set to rise, the prevalence of dementia is expected to increase dramatically. Projections in Australia for example, estimate that the number of people with dementia will more than double in the next 30 years, 2 leading to a considerable impact on the health care system and subsequently the quality of care available.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective: Human {{exposure}} to environmental noise increases {{day to day}} and noise is currently a <b>very</b> important <b>stressful</b> factor. One of the common sources of noise is transportation vehicles. Undesirable impacts of traffic persuaded governments to set rules for the problem and when civil planners and road engineers decide to construct highways, they must {{be sure that the}} related standards and rules have been met. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the rate of noise pollution in crowded areas of Yasuj. Materials and Methods: Noise measuring was done by using B&K Sound Level Meter (model 2230). Noise descriptors (Leq, Max, Min) were measured for 10 minutes of any hour during daytime and night in selected areas (11 stations). One station was also selected as reference point and noise measurement was carried out for the whole week in this station. Results: Leq was found to be 72 ± 4. 4 dB (Max) and 65. 4 ± 7 dB (Min). Recorded maximum and minimum noise was 99. 7 dB (at 17 - 18 o'clock) and 34 dB (at 4 - 5 o'clock), respectively. Conclusion: Comparing the findings of this study with standard scales indicates that Yasuj is experiencing high noise pollution...|$|R
