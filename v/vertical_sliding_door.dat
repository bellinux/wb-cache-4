50|$|The south, {{east and}} west {{elevations}} are notable for full height pilasters marking out bays which to {{the southern part of}} the building are punctuated by smaller pilasters which terminated in a lower cornice that is now removed. The smaller pilasters define the loading dock openings - three to the west, five to the south and six to the east. A continuous concrete ledge projects around the southern third of the building below the dock openings. Eleven original large timber braced-and-ledged <b>vertical</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> remain to these openings providing access to the dock within. Rainwater heads and downpipes run down these elevations.|$|R
50|$|RMS Columba was {{the last}} of three car ferries built in 1964 by Hall, Russell & Company, Aberdeen for the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Secretary of State for Scotland ordered a trio of {{near-identical}} car ferries for the Western Isles. They were chartered to David MacBrayne Ltd and were all equipped to serve as floating nuclear shelters, in the event of national emergency. This included <b>vertical</b> <b>sliding</b> watertight <b>doors</b> that could seal off the car deck, immediately aft of the hoist. Columba {{was the last}} of the three to enter service.|$|R
50|$|The Moulding Shed and Borax Plant extends {{well into}} the road reserve area beside the modern bitumen road {{at the front of}} the complex. The Moulding Shed has a frame of timber poles and has a gabled roof clad with {{corrugated}} iron. It includes storage and loading areas and has a tiny office in one corner. Two kilns with tongue and groove lining with steam pipes set into the ceiling and small covered chimneys are in the Moulding Shed. The Borax Plant is a large steel framed and steel sided box with <b>vertical</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> at each end adjacent to the Moulding Shed. It has a series of large pipes at points around the structure and a large borax tank on the top. There are the remains of rails in the floor and narrow gauge rails which lead from this building once led through the gate and under the road to the railway station. The railway has gone but small sections of the line remain and a few timber sleepers can be seen in the tunnel. 3. The Switching Shed is beside the pathway leading to the sheds and veneer mill from the Office. It is a small square timber building set on a concrete slab and has a skillion roof.|$|R
50|$|The Secretary of State for Scotland {{ordered a}} trio of {{near-identical}} car ferries for the Western Isles. Hall, Russell & Company of Aberdeen won the contract to build them, ahead of fifteen other British yards. The new ferries were initially chartered to David MacBrayne Ltd, and were all equipped to serve as floating nuclear shelters, {{in the event of}} national emergency. This included <b>vertical</b> <b>sliding</b> watertight <b>doors</b> that could seal off the car deck, immediately aft of the hoist. Hebrides, the first of the trio, was launched on 20 November 1963, entered service on 15 April 1964 and served Calmac until 14 November 1985.|$|R
50|$|The Secretary of State for Scotland {{ordered a}} trio of {{near-identical}} car ferries for the Western Isles. Hall, Russell & Company of Aberdeen won the contract to build them, ahead of fifteen other British yards. The new ferries were initially owned by the Scottish Office and resistered in Leith. They were chartered to David MacBrayne Ltd and were all equipped to serve as floating nuclear shelters, {{in the event of}} national emergency. This included <b>vertical</b> <b>sliding</b> watertight <b>doors</b> that could seal off the car deck, immediately aft of the hoist. Clansman, the second of the trio, was launched on 16 January 1964 and entered service on 5 June 1964.|$|R
50|$|The smaller {{carriage}} barn on {{the east}} {{is similar to the}} barn. It is a sawn post-and-beam building on a fieldstone foundation with tongue-and-groove <b>vertical</b> siding and <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> at each gabled end. Inside a stairway leads to the second floor. The smaller privy between the house and barns is more like the former, clapboard-sided with a beaded plank door on an original hand-wrought Suffolk latch. Its walls are sided with plaster on accordion lath.|$|R
50|$|A <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> {{operator}} (or <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> opener or automatic <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> operator) is {{a device}} that operates a <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> for pedestrian use. It opens the door automatically, waits, then closes it.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> {{contain a}} motor and {{activation}} system to open them. These are called <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> operators. Automatic <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> are {{commonly found in}} offices and shop entrances. These doors contain a magnetic locking mechanism that automatically unlocks during emergencies.|$|R
50|$|A <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> {{is a type}} of door {{which opens}} {{horizontally}} by sliding, usually parallel to a wall. <b>Sliding</b> <b>doors</b> can be mounted either on top of a track below or be suspended from a track above and some types 'disappear' in a wall when slid open. There are several types of <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> such as pocket doors, Arcadia doors, and bypass <b>doors.</b> <b>Sliding</b> <b>doors</b> are commonly used as shower doors, glass doors, screen doors, wardrobe doors or in vans.|$|R
50|$|Generation III {{examples}} of the Town & Country with only the passenger side <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> (vs. both rear <b>sliding</b> <b>doors)</b> were only offered for 1996.|$|R
50|$|Procons {{develops}} and manufactures {{components for}} {{the assembly of}} <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> and is currently the Nordic leader {{in the production of}} <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> steel profiles.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuel tank}} access door was {{installed}} {{on the right side}} for all versions sold internationally, however, for the LHD models, and the <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> was on the right side, care needed to be taken to avoid opening the <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> when fuel was being added to the fuel tank. An interlock prevented the <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> from opening too far when the fuel filler door was open.|$|R
40|$|Numerically {{controlled}} {{milling machine}} modified to make head reciprocate. Modification accomplished by removal of original milling head from machine and by mounting <b>vertical</b> <b>slide</b> in its place. <b>Vertical</b> <b>slide</b> driven {{up and down}} by connecting rod bolted off-center to drive pulley. Pulley driven by belt from variable-speed electric motor. Milling-machine head then attached to <b>vertical</b> <b>slide.</b> Mechanism allowed independent control of reciprocating surface speed through variation of speed of electric motor...|$|R
25|$|Automatic <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> {{are open}} and closed either by power, spring, or by a sensor. This {{eliminates}} the need for a person to open or close a door by turning a doorknob or pressing up against a bar on the <b>door</b> itself. Automatic <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> are commonly found at entrance and exits of supermarkets, department stores, and airport terminals. In 1954, Dee Horton and Lew Hewitt co-invented the automatic <b>sliding</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
50|$|The mount/demount {{mechanism}} {{consists of}} the duckhead, swing arm, and <b>vertical</b> <b>slide.</b> The duckhead {{is at the bottom}} end of the <b>vertical</b> <b>slide.</b> The duckhead is uniquely shaped, like a tapered bill, to fit next and surround the rim of a wheel. It can either be made of metal or plastic. The duckhead mounts and demounts the tire from the wheel. The swing arm moves left and right. The purpose of the swing arm is to move the duck head near or away from the rim. The last component of the mount/demount mechanism is the <b>vertical</b> <b>slide.</b> The <b>vertical</b> <b>slide</b> moves up and down so that the duck head can fit onto the rims of different size wheel widths. The <b>vertical</b> <b>slide</b> has a spring and locking handle above the swing arm to set the duckhead and maintain a stable position around the rim.|$|R
5000|$|Automatics: {{automatic}} <b>door</b> operators, <b>sliding</b> <b>doors,</b> {{swing doors}} and revolving <b>doors,</b> automatically operated <b>sliding</b> glass panel partitions ...|$|R
50|$|To {{compensate}} {{for the lack of}} a driver's side <b>sliding</b> <b>door,</b> the edge of the driver's door was extended rearward six inches (152 mm), as {{it was not possible to}} create a driver's side <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> with the current body shell. When the Windstar was being designed in the early 1990s, Ford claimed that a driver's side <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> was not noted as a key feature indicated by focus groups; also at that time, minivans with that feature had sold very poorly.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} used {{to operate}} a <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> is called <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> gear. There are two standard types, top hung or bottom rolling systems. Both types {{do not have a}} perfect seal. To reduce air- and smoke-tightness and sound insulation, brush seals are commonly used.|$|R
50|$|A single {{compartment}} (with toilets) at the no.1 end of {{the carriage}} was reserved for ladies; {{at the opposite end}} of each car three compartments were reserved for smokers, with brass spitoons recessed into the floor. <b>Sliding</b> <b>doors</b> were fitted at every third compartment along the hallway, with an additional <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> to separate the five non-smoking from the single ladies' compartment. The partitions fitted with <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> were full-height and fitted with luggage racks overhanging the seats, while partitions between back-to-back seats were lower.|$|R

50|$|Opens {{normally}} like {{a traditional}} van <b>sliding</b> <b>door,</b> but unlike most <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> where the track ison {{the exterior of}} the vehicle, this type has it inside and {{on the side of the}} door itself. This allows the exterior to remain clean in design and yet the <b>door</b> can <b>slide</b> past the trailing edge of the car. However, this design is very unusual and can only be found on the Mitsubishi RVR (Space Runner, not ASX). Invented by Mitsubishi Motors, it was designed because the RVR is a short car compared to the size of the siding door, making it incapable of having a track on {{the exterior of the}} car. Thus, the inner-track mechanism was used so the <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> can <b>slide</b> open wide enough to let passengers enter and exit the car easily. The new Mitsubishi EK Wagon/Nissan Otti also uses this type of <b>sliding</b> <b>door,</b> but has it only on one side while the driver's side door of the back seats is a normal hinge <b>door.</b> The <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> of the EK wagon is also electric-powered.|$|R

50|$|A typical ryokan has a {{relatively}} large entrance hall, with couches and chairs where guests can sit and talk; a modernized ryokan often has a television in the hall as well. Guest rooms are constructed using traditional Japanese methods: flooring is tatami, and <b>doors</b> are <b>sliding</b> <b>doors.</b> Even if the inn uses hinged doors for security, it usually opens into a small entranceway where guests can take off their shoes before stepping onto the tatami floor, which would be separated by a <b>sliding</b> <b>door.</b> Many ryokan rooms also feature a porch or balcony, also set off with a <b>sliding</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
