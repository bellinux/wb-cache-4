40|$|Does bank {{instability}} push borrowers to use crowdfunding as {{a source}} of external finance? We identify stressed banks and link them to a unique, manually constructed sample of 157 new ventures seeking equity crowdfunding. The sample comprises projects from all German equity crowdfunding platforms since 2011, which we compare with 200 <b>ventures</b> <b>that</b> do not use crowdfunding. Crowdfunding is significantly more likely for new <b>ventures</b> <b>that</b> interact with stressed banks. Innovative funding is thus particularly relevant when conventional financiers are facing crises. But crowdfunded ventures are generally also more opaque and risky than new <b>ventures</b> <b>that</b> do not use crowdfunding...|$|R

40|$|While {{bootstrap}} {{strategies are}} widely used in entrepreneurial ventures, both scholars and practitioners have presented conflicting views on the relation between these strategies and venture development. This paper empirically investigates the impact of bootstrap strategies used at startup on venture development. For this purpose, we use a longitudinal database comprising data from both questionnaires and financial accounts of 214 new <b>ventures.</b> Findings demonstrate <b>that</b> the impact of bootstrap strategies on venture growth is either non-existent or positive. Specifically, new <b>ventures</b> <b>that</b> use more owner funds, employ more interim personnel, incite customers to pay more quickly and apply for more subsidy programs all exhibit higher growth over time. Moreover, <b>ventures</b> <b>that</b> use the buildings of others create more value compared to <b>ventures</b> <b>that</b> own their buildings, without demonstrating differences in growth. Finally, <b>ventures</b> <b>that</b> use more finance {{from family and friends}} do not exhibit differences in growth, but they create consistently less value over time. We discuss the managerial and policy implications of these results and suggest avenues for future research. entrepreneurial finance; bootstrap strategies; startups; venture development; growth...|$|R
5|$|In 1907, Barnette {{was accused}} of embezzling money from the Fairbanks bank he operated, and he was sued {{by the man who}} had funded the <b>venture</b> <b>that</b> led to the {{founding}} of Fairbanks. During the lawsuit, it was revealed that Barnette had been convicted of larceny in Oregon. As his legal bills added up, Barnette decided to lease the Fairbanks Daily News to a group of local businessmen. On June 15, 1908, Barnette ended the lease agreement by selling the newspaper to J. Harmon Caskey and Henry Roden. That same year, the campaign to elect Alaska's first delegate to Congress was under way, and one of the candidates, Jack Corson, purchased one-third of the newspaper. Corson's campaign manager promptly was named the editor of the Daily News, and the paper switched to actively supporting Corson's candidacy.|$|E
5|$|On January 8, 2007, the {{operating}} rights to D.C. United {{were sold to}} D.C. United Holdings, a newly formed group <b>venture</b> <b>that</b> included real estate developer Victor MacFarlane, founder of MacFarlane Partners, and William H.C. Chang, chairman of Westlake International Group. Other investors included D.C. United president Kevin Payne and Blue Devil Development, headed by former Duke basketball players Brian Davis and Christian Laettner. In April 2009, Victor MacFarlane sold {{his share of the}} team to his partner William Chang after two stadium proposals had fallen through. In October 2009, Chang also bought out Davis and Laettner to fully control the team. Chang {{is also one of the}} primary investors of Major League Baseball's San Francisco Giants. In July 2012, Erick Thohir and Jason Levien, minority owners of the Philadelphia 76ers National Basketball Association franchise, joined Chang as partners. Thohir and Levin stated their primary goals are to make United a global brand and build a soccer-specific stadium for the club.|$|E
5|$|The 2005–06 season saw {{a number}} of changes to the make-up of Asia League. In the off-season, the Golden Amur withdrew from the league due to {{financial}} trouble. At {{the same time it}} was announced that Kangwon Land was showing interest in entering a team in the league. However, only a few weeks later, they withdrew their application because it was felt their team wasn't strong enough to enter the league. The league also revised the limits on the number of imports some teams were allowed to have. Halla and the Ice Bucks were both allowed to carry an additional import player while the two Chinese teams were permitted two more import players. It was announced in July 2005 that Anyang Halla Winia would change their name to Anyang Halla. In late July, the league announced that Kangwon Land had acquired some imports and strengthened the team. They had applied again and were expected to enter the league that season. As well another new team, the Nordic Vikings, was expected to join the league. The Nordic Vikings were a Swedish-Chinese joint <b>venture</b> <b>that</b> saw the team based in Beijing. As part of the venture, Swedish players were also sent to the two existing Chinese teams. This brought the league to its high point of nine teams. Even though there were more teams than in the previous season the league reduced the number of games from 42 to 38, which resulted in an uneven schedule. For example, the Korean teams played nine games against each other, while playing four games against the teams from Japan and China except the Nordic Vikings, whom they played five times. At the end of the regular season, the Nippon Paper Cranes had captured first place for a {{second year in a row}} with 95 points. While the Cranes had a very strong showing in the point rankings, the top goal scorer was Song Dong-hwan from Anyang Halla with 31. Derek Plante led in assists with 47 and overall points with 75. The top six teams advanced to the playoffs with the top two teams, the Cranes and Halla, receiving a bye to the semi-finals. In the first round, Kokudo swept the Ice Bucks while Oji Paper defeated the Vikings three games to one. In the second round Kokudo faced Halla, who were making their playoff debut. Kokudo won that series three games to one. On the other side, the Cranes faced off against Oji Paper and swept them in three games. The final was again the Cranes vs Kokudo and once again Kokudo emerged victorious, claiming the title for the second year in a row. Kokudo had three players claiming the three top points spots for the playoffs. Joel Prpic was the top goal scorer with nine, Kiyoshi Fujita had the most assists with 12 and Takahito Suzuki had the most points with 18. Kikuchi Naoya won MVP of the year for the second time and Young Guy of the Year went to Masahito Nishiwaki of the Cranes.|$|E

40|$|Analysis of {{a sample}} of 253 joint <b>venture</b> {{announcements}} suggests <b>that</b> joint <b>ventures</b> tend to be announced when the parent firms' performance is deteriorating. However, the parent firms earn positive abnormal returns around the announcement date. There is considerable cross-sectional variation {{in the stock market}} reaction to joint venture announcements.

The stock market reacts positively to joint <b>ventures</b> <b>that</b> involve pooling of complementary resources. Joint <b>ventures</b> <b>that</b> are carried out by firms with high levels of free cash flow are received negatively, indicating that the stock market penalizes joint <b>ventures</b> <b>that</b> are susceptible to managerial misalignment.
