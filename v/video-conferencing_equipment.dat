40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine diabetes-related {{behavioral}} and psychosocial outcomes as well as patient satisfaction with the Telemedicine for Reach, Education, Access, and Treatment (TREAT) model. Methods TREAT employs telemedicine services provided by an endocrinologist at an urban area in partnership with a diabetes educator in a rural area, working together with patients and primary care providers (PCPs). Thirty-five patients with type 2 diabetes were referred by PCPs and received glycemic management and education in the TREAT model. A diabetes educator operated the <b>video-conferencing</b> <b>equipment,</b> remained with the patient to receive and review plan communicated by the endocri-nologist during the visit, coordinated services, adminis...|$|E
40|$|During the experiment, 28 “interviewers ” each interviewed two {{different}} “applicants, ” where one was deceptive {{and the other}} told the truth. Half of the interviews were done face-to-face and half using desktop <b>video-conferencing</b> <b>equipment.</b> When forced to compare and choose who was more honest between the two applicants, interviewers were accurate in their choice. A significant direct effect of medium on detection of deception was not found. However, communication medium affected perceived eye contact and mental workload, {{both of which were}} found to significantly affect detection accuracy. This study will be of interest to companies beginning to use videoconferencing for job interviews and to scholars engaged in research on person perception in the video context...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{begins with}} a {{discussion}} of using multimedia technologies for education and teleconsultation using PC-based <b>video-conferencing</b> <b>equipment.</b> An overview is provided of the G 7 (i. e., an informal forum of the seven major industrialized democracies) Global Healthcare Applications Project (GHAP), which aims at improving the quality and cost efficiency of health care delivery through telematics (remote access) tools. The paper then describes 2 of the 10 GHAP sub-projects, the Medical Image Reference Center (MEDIREC) and the International Online Academy (IOA). The objectives of MEDIREC are to support clinical activities, contribute to medical education and training, and facilitate medical research. Proposed reference centers would include clinical and pathological images (still and moving) and typical, rare, and difficult to diagnose cases. IOA provides the means for high quality, structured, and certified education and continuing education. (Contains 13 references.) (MES...|$|E
40|$|IN PAST COLUMNS, we {{have talked}} about the Net {{generation}} and how our educational systems need to accommodate this generation of learners. In light of this growing population and their learning needs, let’s talk about learning space. If asked to define learning space, most faculty would speak of formal spaces, such as class-rooms or the nursing learning lab. If the same question were posed {{to members of the}} Net generation, you would be told that learning spaces are all locations where learning takes place. These locations can be virtual or physi-cal and they encompass informal locations such as the local Starbucks coffeehouse (1, p. 12. 4). This makes sense. The Net generation takes advantage of any digital network, includ-ing the wireless access at Starbucks. In the digitally networked world, almost any space outside the classroom can be viewed as an informal learning space. Hall-ways, courtyards, and dormitories are exam-ples. What we must think about, as faculty, is the need to reconceptualize these spaces and consider their instructional implications (2, p. 16). Even the design of classrooms as learning spaces needs to be reconsidered. As Strauss so aptly points out, universities have spent the last decade making classrooms smart in hopes that “smarter classrooms will somehow produce better learning ” (3, p. 13). Strauss recommends that “our focus must be on getting smart teachers and students to use smart tools in a learning space that enables them to learn as individuals everywhere, all the time ” (3, p. 17). Learning Spaces Revisited So, let’s explore some ideas about learning space in the evolv-ing academic setting. The first and probably most important idea is the “emergence of spaces designed around human rather than technological needs ” (4, p. 10). For many years, we filled our classrooms with technology to support the teaching process, such as LCD projectors, computers, and <b>video-conferencing.</b> Frequently, the <b>equipment</b> did huddleboards, lightweight portable white-boards, to generate ideas that are then con-verted to digital images. You can view these classrooms by visitin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – To {{provide the}} same {{classroom}} experiential learning for local and remote students, the BAE department at UGA has developed an "extended classroom " facility whereas all involved (teachers- local or remote; students- local or remote) can hear, see and otherwise interact with each other. Furthermore, in real time, all local and remote participants can annotate their personal versions of classroom activities being recorded into searchable multimedia files that they can take home to review and modify. This report documents engineering instructional needs from the departmental, faculty and student viewpoints and describes {{the integration of the}} software "NetSupport Manager " and "Silicon Chalk " in the delivery of a Machine Vision course and a Java Programming course. This report also describes the adaptation of our <b>video-conferencing</b> <b>equipment</b> into this system so that symmetry is achieved between local and remote sites allowing easy switching between originating teaching sites during any given class session...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the telegenetics {{component of the}} SIGN project. Telegenetics is a subfield of telemedicine applied to clinical genetics. In the SIGN project, telegenetics aims to provide remote genetic services in the cross-border region of Italy and Slovenia. More specifically, {{the goal is to}} develop remote genetic services in areas without them and to provide best expertise in clinical genetics without the need to travel large distances (patients or professionals). The major telegenetics activities within the SIGN project are the development of remote genetic services: for genetic counseling, for expert to expert communication, and for communication between the partners of the project. To accomplish the activities, these major tasks had to be done: testing and selection of <b>video-conferencing</b> <b>equipment</b> and software for secure data sharing and exchange; development of work protocols; end-user education; installation, configuration and testing of necessary hardware, software and developed protocols; and evaluation of user satisfaction (both patients and genetic service providers). The preliminary evaluation results show promising user-satisfaction. They also highlight areas where further improvement of the remote services is possible...|$|E
40|$|Decisions in {{surgical}} oncology {{are increasingly}} being made by multi-disciplinary teams (MDTs). Although MDTs have been widely accepted as the preferred model for cancer service delivery, the process of decision making has not been well described {{and there is little}} evidence pointing to the ideal structure of an MDT. Performance in surgery has been shown to depend on non-technical skills, such as decision making, as well as patient factors and the technical skills of the healthcare team. Application of this systems approach to MDT working allows the identification of factors that affect the quality of decision making for cancer patients. In this article we review the literature on decision making in surgical oncology and by drawing from the systems approach to surgical performance we provide a framework for understanding the process of decision making in MDTs. Technical factors that affect decision making include the information about patients, robust ICT and <b>video-conferencing</b> <b>equipment,</b> a minimum dataset with expert review of radiological and pathological information, implementation and recording of the MDTs decision. Non-technical factors with an impact on decision making include attendance of team members at meetings, leadership, teamwork, open discussion, consensus on decisions and communication with patients and primary care. Optimising these factors will strengthen the decision making process and raise the quality of care for cancer patients...|$|E
