5|$|According to the Polish chronicler Jan Długosz, Stephen did not {{celebrate}} his victory; instead, he fasted for forty days on bread {{and water and}} forbade anyone to attribute the <b>victory</b> <b>to</b> him, insisting that credit be given only to the Lord.|$|E

5|$|After {{breaking}} his own Miami Heat single-season scoring record, Wade gave the jersey he wore in that night's <b>victory</b> <b>to</b> 8-year-old Michael Stolzenberg, an avid Heat fan that {{had his hands}} and feet removed surgically due to a bacterial infection. Wade stated that he knew Stolzenberg previously and wished to add to his collection of Heat memorabilia. Wade has been known for visiting other sick children, usually in private to avoid placing himself in the media spotlight.|$|E
5|$|After {{those two}} wins, Alabama had a 63 record {{heading into the}} final {{two weeks of the}} regular season. In the second-to-last week, the Crimson Tide were defeated, 2614, by Mississippi State. In the final week of the season, Alabama faced {{traditional}} in-state rival Auburn in the annual Iron Bowl game. Reversing the outcome of the previous year's game, Alabama eked out an upset 3117 <b>victory</b> <b>to</b> end the regular season.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} Brisbane International in January 2013, he {{dedicated}} the <b>victory</b> <b>to</b> his friend Ross Hutchins {{who had been}} diagnosed with cancer in December 2012. Hutchins confirmed that Murray’s victory salute after this win was a sign to him.|$|E

5|$|Domenicali insisted {{there were}} no team orders {{and that it was}} Massa who chose to allow Alonso past. Alonso reaffirmed Domenicalli's {{statement}} and admitted he was surprised when Massa slowed and claimed that he felt Massa had a gearbox issue. FIA reporter Lars Osterlind investigated the incident and sent a 160-page report to the World Motor Sport Council which concluded that Alonso should be given a five-second time penalty which would hand the <b>victory</b> <b>to</b> Massa. He also wanted a suspended penalty on the loss of Ferrari's Drivers' and Constructors' points scored in the event. At the World Motor Sport Council meeting held in Paris on 8 September, the tribunal elected to uphold the $100,000 fine imposed on Ferrari, decided that no further action would be taken against the team, and that Formula One's Sporting Working Group would review the rule that prohibited team orders. In December, the FIA announced the rule on team orders would be revoked because it was difficult to enforce. Parallels were made between the race and the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix where Barrichello was ordered by Ferrari to concede the event's <b>victory</b> <b>to</b> Schumacher on its final lap.|$|E
5|$|He was a {{relative}} late-comer to competitive running: {{in his late}} teens, scouts from a local athletics club suggested that his cycling stamina might translate to running and invited him to compete. He won the race and was spurred on by the <b>victory</b> <b>to</b> start taking the sport seriously and focus on running. Zersenay was adamant that his early years in cycling {{had given him a}} firm foundation for endurance running.|$|E

5|$|In the finale, a giant papier-mâché puppet of Colbert ("Fearzilla") {{was brought}} on stage to symbolize his superiority.

5|$|In {{the fourth}} match, Samoa Joe was pitted against Chris Sabin.

5|$|Later {{that day}} in the United States, word of Senna's death reached Talladega, Alabama where NASCAR was running the Winston Select 500 at Talladega Superspeedway. ESPN, which {{televised}} the San Marino Grand Prix for the American audience, had race commentator Bob Jenkins relay word to the viewers during the race. During the postrace festivities, race winner Dale Earnhardt (who would meet a similar fate seven years later) dedicated the <b>victory</b> <b>to</b> Senna.|$|E

On 20 August, Mido made a disappointing debut for Zamalek, wasting a second-half penalty as Zamalek threw away their lead to suffer a late 2–1 home <b>victory</b> <b>to</b> Petrojet in the Egyptian Premier League.|$|E
5|$|On 7 May 2016, Thistle secured their Premiership {{status with}} a 2–0 away <b>victory</b> <b>to</b> Kilmarnock, with goals coming from Steven Lawless and Kris Doolan.

5|$|Pre-election public-opinion polls {{had promised}} <b>victory</b> <b>to</b> the communists. Thus the total {{defeat of the}} PZPR and its {{satellite}} parties {{came as a surprise}} to all involved: after the first round of elections, it became evident that Solidarity had fared extremely well, capturing 160 of 161 contested Sejm seats, and 92 of 100 Senate seats. After the second round, it had won virtually every seat—all 161 in the Sejm, and 99 in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|San Marino {{once had}} the {{smallest}} population of any UEFA country, until the May 2013 election of Gibraltar.
