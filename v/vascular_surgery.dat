40|$|Purpose: Access site {{complications}} following peripheral vascular intervention (PVI) {{are associated}} with prolonged hospitalization and increased mortality. Prediction of access site complication risk may optimize PVI care; however, there is no tool designed for this.

Methods: The Society for <b>Vascular</b> <b>Surgery’s</b> <b>Vascular</b> Quality Initiative database yielded 27, 997 patients who had undergone PVI at 131 North American centers.

25|$|It is {{relatively}} unusual (25% {{of the total}} number of cases) for cholesterol emboli to occur spontaneously; this usually happens in people with severe atherosclerosis of the large arteries such as the aorta. In the other 75% it is a complication of medical procedures involving the blood vessels, such as <b>vascular</b> <b>surgery</b> or angiography. In coronary catheterization, for instance, the incidence is 1.4%. Furthermore, cholesterol embolism may develop after the commencement of anticoagulants or thrombolytic medication that decrease blood clotting or dissolve blood clots, respectively. They probably lead to cholesterol emboli by removing blood clots that cover up a damaged atherosclerotic plaque; cholesterol-rich debris can then enter the bloodsteam.|$|E
25|$|Surgery is {{an ancient}} medical {{specialty}} that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, a perforated ear drum). Surgeons must also manage pre-operative, post-operative, and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards. Surgery has many sub-specialties, including general surgery, ophthalmic surgery, cardiovascular surgery, colorectal surgery, neurosurgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, oncologic surgery, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, podiatric surgery, transplant surgery, trauma surgery, urology, <b>vascular</b> <b>surgery,</b> and pediatric surgery. In some centers, anesthesiology {{is part of the}} division of surgery (for historical and logistical reasons), although it is not a surgical discipline. Other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, but are not considered surgical sub-specialties per se.|$|E
