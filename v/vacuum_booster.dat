25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1940 Oldsmobile offered totally {{different}} styling during a single model year. The top of the line 1948 Oldsmobile 98 drew heavily from the Futuramic styling concept that would be used on all 1949 Oldsmobiles. Standard equipment on 98s included a solenoid starter, fender skirts, E-Z-l rearview mirror, and foam rubber seat cushions. The 98s also included front and rear bumper guards, <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> pump, plastic radiator ornament, dual horns, dual sun visors, and cigarette lighter. Deluxe equipment added front and rear floor mats, Deluxe steering wheel, wheel trim rings, rear seat armrests, and hydraulic window, seat and top controls on all convertibles. Upholstery was either broadcloth or leather. The standard tire size was 6.50 x 16. With the introduction of new postwar styling Custom Cruiser 98 was renamed the Futuramic 98. The Custom Cruiser name would be revived to denote full-size Oldsmobile station wagons in 1971. The new styling was apparently popular with a record 65,235 98s sold, exceeding the number of 90s sold in 1940 for {{the first time}}.|$|E
2500|$|In 1947 {{the top of}} {{the line}} Custom Cruiser 98 again had three body styles. This was the last year for the 98 1942 prewar body. All 98s had the {{straight}} eight engine.

25|$|ESC uses a {{hydraulic}} modulator {{to assure that}} each wheel receives the correct brake force. A similar modulator is used in ABS. ABS needs to reduce pressure during braking, only. ESC additionally needs to increase pressure in certain situations and an active <b>vacuum</b> brake <b>booster</b> unit may be utilized {{in addition to the}} hydraulic pump to meet these demanding pressure gradients.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fuzzy longitudinal control system with car-following speed ranging from 0 to 120 km/h, thereby achieving the main functions of both {{adaptive cruise control}} (ACC) and Stop&Go control. A fuzzy longitudinal controller is synthesized by inputting the difference of the actual relative distance and the safe distance obtained from the preceding vehicle, and the relative speed, and then outputting the pulse-width-modulation (PWM) signal to control the output forces of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>boosters.</b> With {{the use of the}} high-level controller from dSPACE, the fuzzy control law is easily and rapidly implemented using Matlab/Simulink for the experimental car, and the controller's parameters can be changed and updated by analyzing data based on the relative distance using Lidar, the speed of the host vehicle, the opening of the throttle and the position of the braking pedal. For the sake of safe driving, experimental results are conducted by simulating the various possible car-following conditions for the ACC and Stop&Go controllers, thereby obtaining virtually relative distances and speeds to tune the controller's parameters and ensure the safety of the controller. Several car following experiments are conducted to show that the proposed fuzzy longitudinal controller is capable of achieving the requirements of comfort and safety, and giving a satisfactory performance at high and low speed conditions...|$|R

50|$|The master {{cylinder}} is located behind the driver’s side dashboard {{mounted on the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster.</b> The pressure inside of the {{master cylinder}} is created by a primary and secondary piston. These are pushed by the output rod of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> to compress fluid within its primary and secondary chambers (hydraulic pressure). The hydraulic pressure is translated through the brake lines to the brake calipers. When the brake fluid is pushed through the brake lines, the master cylinder chambers are replenished by the reservoir (attached {{to the top of}} the master cylinder).|$|E
5000|$|To {{show the}} {{capabilities}} of the Bendix Corporation. the new car would incorporate many of the Bendix products such as the famed Bendix Startex system, Scintilla magnetos, Stromberg carburetors, Pioneer instruments and Bragg-Kliesrath <b>vacuum</b> brake <b>boosters.</b> With General Motors, however, as a shareholder in the company and U.S. automakers his main clientele, Bendix feared that his car would be seen as competition to his biggest clients. The top-secret program was set up with a [...] "dummy" [...] company designation, the [...] "Steel Wheel Corporation". The SWC designation on the project was intended to further disguise the true intentions of the project.|$|R
50|$|A {{microwave}} power module consists of a solid state power amplifier, which drives a <b>vacuum</b> power <b>booster,</b> typically a traveling wave tube. The {{high voltage power supply}} required by the TWT is provided by an electronic power conditioner. In pulsed-mode MPMs, the power conditioner provides a pulsed high voltage that is triggered by a trigger input. MPMs also include a microcontroller, which is responsible for controlling the operation of the module, such as making sure the various power supply voltages come up in the appropriate sequence to prevent damage to the TWT. It also reports the module status, including the various voltages, currents and temperatures.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum {{may be used}} to power, {{or provide}} {{assistance}} to mechanical devices. In hybrid and diesel engine motor vehicles, a pump fitted on the engine (usually on the camshaft) is used to produce vacuum. In petrol engines, instead, vacuum is typically obtained as a side-effect of the operation of the engine and the flow restriction created by the throttle plate, but may be also supplemented by an electrically operated vacuum pump to boost braking assistance or improve fuel consumption. This vacuum may then be used to power the following motor vehicle components: <b>vacuum</b> servo <b>booster</b> for the hydraulic brakes, motors that move dampers in the ventilation system, throttle driver in the cruise control servomechanism, door locks or trunk releases.|$|R
50|$|Many older {{vehicles}} used vacuum-powered windshield wipers. Loss of {{manifold vacuum}} when {{the engine was}} working hard, or at wide open throttle, necessitated using a <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> pump which was usually part of the fuel pump.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> or vacuum servo {{is used in}} {{most modern}} {{hydraulic}} brake systems which contain four wheels. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> is attached between the master cylinder and the brake pedal and assists the braking force applied by the driver. These units consist of a hollow housing with a movable rubber diaphragm across the center, creating two chambers. When attached to the intake manifold of the engine or the vacuum pump, the pressure in both chambers of the unit is lowered. The equilibrium created by the low pressure in both chambers keeps the diaphragm from moving until the brake pedal is depressed. A return spring keeps the diaphragm in the starting position until the brake pedal is applied.|$|E
50|$|As an {{improvement}} to Pars, the 16V utilizes solid disc brakes on rear wheels, {{but unlike the}} ELX which is equipped with an advanced ABS/EBD, the 16V model uses the same <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster,</b> master cylinder, distributor, and hydraulic lines as the standard Pars.|$|E
5000|$|The VAZ-2103 is a deluxe compact sedan car (small class, {{passenger}} car, model 3 in Soviet classification), {{produced by}} AvtoVAZ and introduced in 1972. Better {{known as the}} Lada outside of its native Russia, it was a localized version of the Fiat 124 Special built under license and tailored for the Soviet and Eastern European market. The 2103 differs from the VAZ-2101 exterior, with four headlights, moldings {{on the sides of}} the body and large rear lights. Its main difference - the more powerful [...] straight four. In addition, this model is distinguished by the presence of <b>vacuum</b> brake <b>booster</b> and self-adjusting rear brakes, [...] "sport" [...] instrument panel with rev counter and a dashboard clock.|$|R
40|$|The Hybrid Propulsion Demonstration Program (HPDP) {{program was}} formed to mature hybrid {{propulsion}} technology to a readiness level sufficient to enable commercialization for various space launch applications.

The HPDP has successfully conducted four tests of the 250, 000 pound thrust hybrid rocket motor at NASA's Stennis Space Center. This paper documents the test series...|$|R
50|$|The B4's 1495 {{kilogram}} mass is {{slowed by}} 294mm ventilated front disc brakes and twin-pot floating calipers and 290mm ventilated rear discs and single-pot floating calipers. An increased diameter <b>vacuum</b> assisted tandem <b>booster</b> gives reduced pedal effort though relatively firm braking feel (see graph). The system is diagonally linked to maintain {{safety in the}} event one line should fail, and front and rear pressure control valve are used to balance braking force to suit weight distribution. Maximum braking deceleration from 100 km/h is 0.99g with a 39.4 metre stopping distance.|$|R
50|$|In 1947 {{the top of}} {{the line}} Custom Cruiser 98 again had three body styles. This was the last year for the 98 1942 prewar body. All 98s had the {{straight}} eight engine. Standard 98 equipment included safety glass, spare wheel and tire, dual horns, <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> pump, cigarette lighter, and a solenoid starter system. Upholstery was either custom broadcloth or leather. Standard tire size was 7.00 in by 15 in. An electric clock was standard in 1947. A record 37,140 98s were sold in 1947.|$|E
50|$|In 1947 more {{models were}} offered on the low-priced Special 60 series {{than the other}} two Oldsmobile series. The 8-cylinder engine {{returned}} to the Special 60 series and there were again 66 and 68 versions of each body style offered. Standard equipment included: safety glass, spare wheel and tire, dual horns, <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> pump and cigarette lighter. The standard interior fabric was tan mixture cloth. Standard tire size was 6.00 x 16 inches. Horsepower grew to 100 for the six and 110 for the eight. It also had a 37 ft turning circle.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> {{was invented}} in 1927 {{in order to provide}} a shorter {{stopping}} distance. Vacuum boosters provide brake assist for the driver by multiplying the force out of the booster creating more than the force that was used to push on the brake pedal. The booster works by pulling the air out of the booster chamber with a pump creating a low pressure system inside. When the driver steps on the brake pedal, the input rod on the booster is pushed in which lets atmospheric pressure into the booster. This, in turn, pushes the diaphragm toward the master cylinder.|$|E
50|$|The vacuum can be {{generated}} in two distinct methods, dependent {{on the type of}} internal combustion engine, or other motive force (as in electric vehicles). In naturally-aspirated petrol engines, the manifold vacuum is used, whereas in turbo charged, diesel engines, and electric/hybrid vehicles a separate vacuum pump is used (or in certain high altitude places, naturally-aspirated vehicles are not capable of producing enough <b>vacuum</b> for the <b>booster.</b> The <b>vacuum</b> pump can be driven mechanically (from the engine) or by means of an electric motor. The vacuum is transferred to the servo along non-collapsible vacuum lines, and is stored in the servo by using a non-return valve.|$|R
40|$|A {{new class}} of compact and {{lightweight}} S-band 1 kW traveling-wave tube (TWT) is being developed for a microwave power module (MPM) {{that will be used}} for phased antenna array radar applications. The proposed S-band MPM provides a tenfold peak power increase compared to state-of-the-art S-band MPMs. In this paper, the design of the <b>vacuum</b> power <b>booster</b> TWT part of the MPM is presented. The compact and lightweight S-band TWT is driven by a 6 kV, 0. 9 A electron beam. The amplifier is predicted by large-signal simulations to generate over 1 kW at S-band with 25 dB saturated gain and over 40 % efficiency. The stability from unwanted oscillations has been investigated. To suppress the oscillations, the helix circuit has been coated with carbon composite material. The coaxial input and output antennas have been fabricated. For efficiency enhancement, a multi-stage depressed collector (MDC) has been designed using a 3 D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulator, VORPAL. The collector design makes use of a current loop based on a feedback mechanism for effective design process. The integrated designs of a helix circuit, an electron gun, a periodic permanent magnet (PPM), antennas, and a collector are presented. </p...|$|R
50|$|The Zil-111 was a {{limousine}} {{produced by the}} Soviet car manufacturer ZiL in 1958-1967. It was the first post-war limousine designed in the Soviet Union. After tests with the shortlived prototype ZIL-Moscow in 1956, which gained {{a place in the}} Guinness Book of Records as the largest passenger car in the world, the ZIL-111 was introduced from ZIL in 1958. The body style was in the American tradition of the time and resembled the mid-1950s cars built by Packard, an American luxury automobile manufacturer, although, apart from the similar styling, the car was an original design and had nothing in common with them, except in general layout. The interiors were trimmed with top quality leather and broadcloth and decorated with thick pile carpet and polished wooden fittings. It featured a comprehensive ventilation and heating system and a 5-band radio, all of which could be controlled from the rear, electric windows, vacuum-operated screen wash, windshield and front door window defrosting. It was powered by a 6.0 L V8 engine producing 200 hp connected to an automatic transmission (similar to that of Chrysler's PowerFlite and influenced by it, but different in design) giving a top speed of 170 km/h, hydraulic drum brakes with a <b>vacuum</b> servo <b>booster,</b> coil and wishbone IFS. The car won a top prize at the Brussels Expo World Fair in 1958.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> or vacuum servo {{is used in}} {{most modern}} {{hydraulic}} brake systems which contain four wheels. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> is attached between the master cylinder and the brake pedal and multiplies the braking force applied by the driver. These units consist of a hollow housing with a movable rubber diaphragm across the center, creating two chambers. When attached to the low-pressure portion of the throttle body or intake manifold of the engine, the pressure in both chambers of the unit is lowered. The equilibrium created by the low pressure in both chambers keeps the diaphragm from moving until the brake pedal is depressed. A return spring keeps the diaphragm in the starting position until the brake pedal is applied. When the brake pedal is applied, the movement opens an air valve which lets in atmospheric pressure air to one chamber of the booster. Since the pressure becomes higher in one chamber, the diaphragm moves toward the lower pressure chamber with a force created by {{the area of the}} diaphragm and the differential pressure. This force, in addition to the driver's foot force, pushes on the master cylinder piston. A relatively small diameter booster unit is required; for a very conservative 50% manifold vacuum, an assisting force of about 1500 N (200n) is produced by a 20 cm diaphragm with an area of 0.03 square meters. The diaphragm will stop moving when the forces {{on both sides of the}} chamber reach equilibrium. This can be caused by either the air valve closing (due to the pedal apply stopping) or if [...] "run out" [...] is reached. Run out occurs when the pressure in one chamber reaches atmospheric pressure and no additional force can be generated by the now stagnant differential pressure. After the run out point is reached, only the driver's foot force can be used to further apply the master cylinder piston.|$|E
50|$|Power brakes are {{a system}} of {{hydraulics}} used to slow down or stop most motor vehicles. It uses a combination of mechanical components to multiply the force applied to the brake pedal by the driver into enough force to actuate the brakes and stop a vehicle that can weigh several tons. The brake pedal {{is connected to the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>booster</b> which is the first step of the force multiplication. The booster passes the force to the master cylinder which compresses a liquid and forces it through the brake lines to the brakes themselves. The liquid that is pushed into the brakes activates the brake calipers which in the case of disc brakes, push against the brake rotor causing friction that slows and eventually stops the rotation of the vehicles wheels. In drum brakes, pistons push two shoes against the brake drum accomplishing the same effect.|$|E
40|$|A low cost, {{small size}} and mass, low heater power, durable {{high-performance}} barium dispenser thermionic cathode {{has been developed}} that offers significant advancements in the design, manufacture, and performance of the electron sources used in vacuum electronic devices [...] such as microwave (and millimeter wave) traveling-wave tubes (TWT's) [...] and in display devices such as high-brightness, high-resolution cathode ray tubes (CRT's). The lower cathode heater power and the reduced size and mass of the new cathode {{are expected to be}} especially beneficial in TWT's for deep space communications, where future missions are requiring smaller spacecraft, higher data transfer rates (higher frequencies and radiofrequency output power), and greater electrical efficiency. Also expected to benefit are TWT's for commercial and government communication satellites, for both low and geosynchronous Earth orbit, with additional benefits offered by lower cost and potentially higher cathode current loading. A particularly important TWT application is in the microwave power module (MPM), which is a hybrid microwave (or millimeter wave) amplifier consisting of a low-noise solid state driver, a <b>vacuum</b> power <b>booster</b> (small TWT), and an electronic power conditioner integrated into a single compact package. The attributes of compactness and potentially high electrical efficiency make the MPM very attractive for many commercial and government (civilian and defense) applications in communication and radar systems.
