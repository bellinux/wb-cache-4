5|$|While the {{merchant}} marine was technologically outdated, and slower {{than that of}} the First World, it still attracted a consistent <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo.</b> The reason for the technological backwardness of {{the merchant}} marine were First World induced boycotts of Soviet shipping. This led the Soviet Union to become isolated from the international shipping industry, and skip over such important innovations as shipping containers. Under Mikhail Gorbachev's rule the Soviet Union became the largest buyer of new ships in the world. Because of the size of its navy, the Soviet Government advocated for the traditional freedoms of the sea.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II and the Paris Peace Treaties, Rijeka {{became a}} part of Croatia and Yugoslavia. This {{provided}} the Port of Rijeka with a new market and sparked further development. A bulk cargo terminal was completed in 1967, followed by warehouses in Škrljevo in 1978. In 1979, a container terminal in Sušak, a phosphate terminal in Rijeka and a timber terminal in Bršica were added. Joining them were a livestock terminal in Bršica and a general cargo terminal with a roll-on/roll-off ramp in the Bakar area in 1982 and 1983 respectively. The greatest <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> was recorded in 1980, when 20.2million tonnes, including 13.1million tonnes of liquid cargo, were transported. The port suffered another period of stagnation in the 1990s due to the Croatian War of Independence, when a portion of the port's shipping switched to Trieste and Koper. Since 1996, the volume of operations of the Port of Rijeka has again been gradually growing.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{the economy}} of Liverpool was centred on the city's port and {{manufacturing}} base, although a smaller proportion of total employment is today derived from the port. Nonetheless the city {{remains one of the}} most important ports in the United Kingdom, handling over 32.2m tonnes of cargo in 2008. A new multimillion-pound expansion to the Port of Liverpool, Liverpool2, is scheduled to be operational from the end of 2015, and is projected to greatly increase the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> which Liverpool is able to handle. Liverpool is also home to the UK headquarters of many shipping lines including Japanese firm NYK and Danish firm Maersk Line, whilst shipping firm Atlantic Container Line has recently invested significant amounts in expanding its Liverpool operations, with a new headquarters currently under construction. Future plans to redevelop the city's northern dock system, in a project known as Liverpool Waters, could see £5.5bn invested in the city over the next 50 years, creating 17,000 new jobs.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} New Orleans {{contrasts}} significantly with {{the histories of}} other cities that {{became part of the}} Confederate States of America. Because it was founded by the French and owned by Spain for a time, New Orleans had a more cosmopolitan culture and diverse population. Only 13 percent of the 1810 population was Anglo-American. The census population of that time was made up of mostly French speaking refugees from the Haitian Revolution, the French and Indian War, and French and Spanish Creoles along with some smuggled slaves. New Orleans also benefited more by the Industrial Revolution, international trade, and geographical position. Its position by the mouth of the Mississippi River, which drained {{an important part of the}} United States, made New Orleans one of the most significant transportation centers in the early United States before the establishment of railroad and road systems. Of particular significance were the inventions of the steamboat and the cotton gin. Before the steamboat, keelboat men bringing cargo downriver would break up their boats for lumber in New Orleans and travel overland back to Ohio or Illinois to repeat the process. Steamboats had enough power to move upstream against the current of the Mississippi, making two-way trade possible between New Orleans and the cities in the interior river network. With the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, which greatly expanded international trade, and the development of the cotton gin, cotton became a valuable export product, adding to the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> moved through the city.|$|E
25|$|Chennai Port, {{formerly}} known as Madras Port, is the second largest container port of India, behind the Nhava Sheva Port, and the largest port in the Bay of Bengal. It is the third oldest port among the 13 major ports of India with official port operations beginning in 1881, although maritime trade started much earlier in 1639 on the undeveloped shore. It is an artificial and all-weather port with wet docks. Once a major travel port, it become a major container port in the post-Independence era. The port remains a primary reason for the economic growth of Tamil Nadu, especially for the manufacturing boom in South India, and has contributed greatly {{to the development of}} the city. It is due of the existence of the port that the city of Chennai eventually became known as the Gateway of South India. The port has become a hub port for containers, cars and project cargo in the east coast of India. From handling a meagre <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> in the early years of its existence, consisting chiefly of imports of oil and motors and the export of groundnuts, granite and ores, the port has started handling more than 60 million tonnes of cargo in recent years. In 2008, the port's container traffic crossed 1 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). It is currently ranked the 86th largest container port in the world and there are plans to expand the capacity to about 140 million tonnes per annum. It is an ISO 14001:2004 and ISPS-certified port and has become a main line port having direct connectivity to more than 50 ports around the world.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold. First, I want to make it clear the source of {{competitiveness}} of Japanese main container ports. Second, I will specify the course of suitable container port policy in Japan. In general, there are three sources of competitiveness of container ports, that is, industrial agglomeration and <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargoes</b> as the result of it, supply chain networks, especially, networks of shipping lines and stevedoring system in container port. Now, Japanese main container ports have lost the first source of competitiveness of container ports, namely, <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargoes</b> and networks <b>of</b> shipping lines of these ports are weakening. The result clearly show that Japanese main container ports can not depend to increase container cargoes throughput on only efficient stevedoring system in port as the third source of competitiveness of container port. Therefore, Japanese government should, at first, support to strengthen supply chain networks as short-term policy and secondly promote to reagglomerate or regenerate the cluster of manufacturing industry as long-term policy...|$|R

500|$|The act {{of hiring}} a ship to carry cargo is called chartering.

In a time charter the vessel is hired for a set period of time, to perform voyages as the charterer directs. In a bareboat charter the charterer acts as the ship's operator and manager, taking on responsibilities such as providing the crew and maintaining the vessel. Finally, in a contract of affreightment or COA, the charterer specifies a total <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> to be carried in a specific time period and in specific sizes, for example a COA could be specified as [...] of JP-5 in a year's time in [...] shipments.
