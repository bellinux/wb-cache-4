5000|$|The motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>component</b> {{manufacturing}} {{industry in the}} U.S. has experienced robust growth due to increased demand and vehicle sales. The stability and highly-integrated North American supply chain has also been particularly beneficial to suppliers, contributing to growth in both jobs and investments in the United States. Many suppliers located in the U.S. import and export vehicle parts and components within the North American market. Depending on supply chain logistics, parts are often exported to be combined with other parts, then imported back to the U.S. for final vehicle assembly.|$|E

50|$|While all spaceplanes {{have used}} {{atmospheric}} lift for the reentry phase, none {{to date have}} succeeded in a design that relies on aerodynamic lift for the ascent phase in reaching space (excluding a mother ship first stage). Efforts such as the Silbervogel and X-30/X-33 have all failed to materialize into a vehicle capable of successfully reaching space. The Pegasus winged booster has had many successful flights to deploy orbital payloads, but since its aerodynamic <b>vehicle</b> <b>component</b> operates only as a booster, and not operate in space as a spacecraft, it is not typically {{considered to be a}} spaceplane.|$|E

40|$|Selective {{testing of}} {{aircraft}} or other vehicular components without requiring disassembly {{of the vehicle}} or components was accomplished by using a portable guide apparatus. The device consists of a broadband noise source, a guide to direct the acoustic energy, soft sealing insulation to seal the guide to the noise source and to the <b>vehicle</b> <b>component,</b> and noise measurement microphones, both outside the vehicle at the acoustic guide output and inside the vehicle to receive attenuated sound. By directing acoustic energy only to selected components of a vehicle via the acoustic guide, {{it is possible to}} test a specific component, such as a door or window, without picking up extraneous noise which may be transmitted to the vehicle interior through other components or structure. This effect is achieved because no acoustic energy strikes the vehicle exterior except at the selected component. Also, since the test component remains attached to the <b>vehicle,</b> <b>component</b> dynamics with vehicle frame are not altered...|$|E
