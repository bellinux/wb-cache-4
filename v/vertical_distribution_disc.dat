The protected layer evolutional characteristics of vertical stress, vertical displacement and pressure relief affection which coal pillar affected were analyzed. The results show that: (1) Coal pillar affected zone is high stress concentrated zone. Because of coal pillar width influence, trended <b>vertical</b> stress <b>distribution</b> is from “v shape” to “partial saddle shape”; tendency <b>vertical</b> stress <b>distribution</b> is “flat <b>disc</b> shape”. Vertical stress is non-linear with coal pillar width, vertical stress is most concentrated when coal seam reserved 20 m coal pillar, <b>vertical</b> stress <b>distribution</b> is from “single peak shape” to “double peak shape”. (2) Coal pillar affected zone is low strain region. Coal pillar decreases protected layer overall deformation, not just reduce deformation of coal pillar affected zone.

The <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution</b> pattern was calculated from the data of the tags attached to six individuals. We indicated that current electronic tag technology is able to collect information from fish for estimating input parameters to models regarding its <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution</b> pattern. We found that the fish distribution in the tropical Atlantic had a large peak in the shallowest water layer at depths less than 10 m.

40|$|Many {{marine species}} spend {{part of their}} {{development}} in upper layers of the water column, where they may be exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR). For many of these species, light {{is one of the}} key environmental clues which triggers behaviorally-mediated adjustments in <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution.</b> We incubated planktonic larvae of the crab Cyrtograpsus altimanus in column-like aquaria to study their responses with/without UVR (under a solar simulator) and with/without a potential prey (the dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense). Their <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution</b> was recorded and used to evaluate the combined effects of UVR and the presence of the dinoflagellate on larval behavior. When UVR was absent, most larvae showed a tendency to swim upwards and to aggregate near the surface, regardless of the dinoflagellate presence. However, UVR inhibited this tendency and induced a repellent effect, which resulted in a more homogeneous <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution</b> of larvae. A. tamarense did not affect the <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution</b> of larvae. These results suggest that UVR-triggered, quick adjustments in <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution</b> might be an important strategy for C. altimanus larvae to cope with high solar radiation, which typically occur during the hatching season...|$|R
40|$|Volcanic ash soil {{contains}} large {{stocks of}} organic matter per unit area. A large proportion {{of organic matter}} is stored in the subsoil; therefore, {{a thorough understanding of}} its <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution</b> is needed to predict the effects of change in climate and land use. Faunal bioturbation is often cited as the dominant process that affects the <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution</b> of organic matter. An additional but often overlooked process is change in the volume of the soil. Such change might affect the <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution</b> of organic matter by changing the position of the soil surface, which can affect the soil-forming processes related to depth, such as weathering, decomposition, bioturbation and rooting. We calculated the change in volume with geochemical mass balance equations, and showed the effect of change in soil volume on the <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution</b> of organic matter using a dynamic model. Then we evaluated the plausibility of the model concept with an independent model for parameter identification and through a model sensitivity analysis. Results show that volume change is a major soil-forming process that determines the <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution</b> of organic matter in volcanic ash soil as the active bioturbation zone moves upwards in response to soil thickening...|$|R

40|$|A central goal {{of ecology}} is to {{understand}} the causes of spatial and temporal variation in the composition and structure of ecological communities. One way a species distribution may vary within its range is through changes in its <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution.</b> Variation in <b>vertical</b> <b>distributions</b> can influence local species abundance, which in turn can determine species ranges {{and the structure of}} communities. For my dissertation research, I investigated latitudinal gradients of rocky intertidal community structure along 5500 km of coastline in the northeast Pacific Ocean. The spatially explicit design of this study allows the explicit answering of many ecological questions at a fine resolution for a large suite of species across their geographic range. By mapping the x, y, and z coordinates of intertidal species at cm scale accuracy, I determined the distribution patterns for abundance, vertical extent, and upper vertical limit of species across their range. I find the abundant center distribution, ramped south distribution and non-directional distribution are the most common distribution patterns. The distribution patterns are consistent for the majority of species between abundance, vertical extent and upper vertical limit. Next, I test the explicit hypothesis that <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution</b> of species varied progressively with latitude using linear regressions, which examined the relationship between community similarity and the <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution</b> of species. For many of the abundant species of intertidal invertebrates and algae that constitute those communities, sites that have a similar <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution</b> of species also have a similar community structure. Finally, I focus on central California to determine how the <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution</b> of species is explained by environmental factors. Of the nine abiotic factors investigated, reef slope, rock color, solar incidence, rock hardness and reef length explained the variability of species' upper limit. These abiotic factors influence the temperature of the reef which relates to desiccation stress. Whereas the vertical extent of species is explained by aspects of the reef's geomorphology that influences the abundance and reach of mobile consumers such as reef slope and rugosity. Across 32 &# 778; of latitude, species' <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution</b> change in relation to abiotic forces and underlie the community structure patterns within the rocky intertidal...|$|R
