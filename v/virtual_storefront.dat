With this commonplace use of electronic money, you might assume that paper payments are shrinking, and perhaps the predictions of a cashless society, which have persisted since the 1960 s, will come true.

40|$|Consumer {{behavior}} in online shops {{has not yet}} been the subject of many research projects. We know little about the demographics of online customers and even less about the factors influencing their decision to buy. Initial research results show that - in online commerce too - trustworthiness of suppliers is the factor which most influences willingness to buy (see [6]). And, of course, practitioners do market research both by questionnaires and server statistics. Most well-known online shops such as Amazon. com, Dell Computers, Streamline Inc. gain competitive advantage by systematically gathering data from customers, analyzing it and using it to shape their <b>virtual</b> <b>storefronts,</b> product ranges etc. This data is most often proprietary and not available to outsiders.

40|$|E-tailing {{is gaining}} {{momentum}} in Australia as traditional retailers are moving towards {{the adoption of}} a clicks and bricks strategy. Electronic retailing or E-tailing can be described as selling goods to customers directly through electronic means. Although this Business-to-Consumer phenomenon is not new, it is helping retailers to conduct business online with <b>virtual</b> <b>storefronts</b> and to reach local and global customers who are disadvantaged by geographical and other distinct barriers. This chapter starts by detailing the current state of e-tailing with supporting statistical figures from recent research with a specific emphasis on Australia. Overall growth in Internet accessibility rates across Australia clearly demonstrate e-tailing’s importance to online customers. Literature review once again proves the fact that Internet not only creates opportunities for retailers but also poses many challenges. Further discussion provides an understanding of the suitability of the retailing channel for different products and services. This study then analyses the usability of Australia’s top twenty-five retailers’ websites focussing on website usability factors, such as navigation, searchability, purchasing, layout and clarity, information content, and web browser compatibility. Australia’s e-tailing initiatives might be lagging behind most developed markets, however recent research indicates that there is a significant growth in this online activity and it will continue to attract more and more online customers in the coming years as retailers jump on the e-tailing bandwagon...|$|R
40|$|Context is the surroundings, circumstances, environment, background, or {{settings}} which determine, specify, or {{clarify the}} meaning of an event.

40|$|Internet {{technology}} has {{allowed for a}} higher degree of decoupling between the information-intensive sales process and the physical process of inventory management than its brick-and-mortar counterpart. As a result, some Internet retailers choose to outsource inventory and back-end operations to focus on the sales/marketing aspects of e-commerce. Nonetheless, many retailers keep fulfillment capabilities in-house. In this paper, we identify and empirically test factors that persuade firms to integrate inventory and fulfillment capabilities with <b>virtual</b> <b>storefronts.</b> Based on the extant literature and previous research in e-commerce, we formulate nine theoretical predictions. We then use data from a sample of over 50 public Internet retailers to test whether empirical data are consistent with these hypotheses. Finally, given the strategic importance and financial magnitude of the inventory investment decision, we analyze the effect of this decision on the economic success of Internet retailers during the period of study. We find that there are many circumstances in which it is prudent to own fulfillment capabilities and inventory. Empirical data are consistent with hypotheses that this tendency is higher for older firms selling small, high-margin products, offering lower levels of product variety, and facing lower demand uncertainty. We also discover that firms making inventory ownership decisions that are consistent with an empirical benchmark derived from environmental and strategic factors are less likely to go bankrupt than those making inconsistent inventory choices.

2500|$|The Humble Store is an {{extension}} of the sales system developed for managing the Humble Bundles. It offers the capabilities of the payment and customer services that they had created for the various Bundles to independent developers as an alternate marketplace for these titles. According to Joshua Knoles of the Humble Bundle team, they [...] "wanted to create something that would allow developers to easily sell their games through their own web site as well as provide a painless buying experience for purchasers". Once developers have signed on with the Humble Store, they are given a widget that they can include on their web site which allows users to purchase the game (the Humble Store was usually inaccessible unless one directly searched for the widget for a particular game). In some cases, such as with [...] and Sportsfriends, the developers used the Humble Store to provide tier rewards during their crowd funding phase using sites like Kickstarter. As with the Bundles, once purchased the buyer has access to all software titles from the store at any time. Ben Kuchera of [...] "Penny Arcade Reports" [...] compares the Humble Store as a potential competitor to <b>virtual</b> <b>storefronts</b> like Steam, offering a more personable level of service to developers and customers than these larger systems. In July 2016, Humble Bundle created its Gamepages service that offered developers that are already using the widget dedicated website space to allow them to sell and advertise their game, avoiding the need to secure this website space on their own.|$|R

Looking at security from a distributed point of view makes this elephant seem much bigger! The growth of the Internet (see chapter 2) is also not very comforting to computer security specialists. Companies want to start utilising the Internet for their business transactions, while the man on the street wants to use it for what they deem necessary or convenient. It {{is becoming more and more}} common placed to buy items from <b>virtual</b> <b>storefronts</b> by making use of the Internet. [17, 20, 23] Literature, as well as the World Wide Web has supplied us with information [34] regarding the "war" between the IT Security Professional and the hacker community. It is quite surprising to see the large number of hacker sites on the Internet [15, 16, 21] that publish information regarding hacked sites, as well as tools and techniques that can assist almost anyone in accomplishing some of these sometimes, daring feats. If this information is studied and if we keep in mind that some of the more serious hacking attempts are being kept secret for reasons like loss of business or credibility, it might be deduced that the hacker community is always a step or two ahead of Security Professionals. It is the purpose of this thesis to present a model that will ensure secure, anonymous communication across the Internet This model is not aimed at replacing current technologies. It merely attempts to provide an alternative method for safe communication across public networks, like the Internet. The model will make use of a number of existing technologies in conjunction with one another to achieve its goal of secure, anonymous communication. The technologies that will be used and how will be discussed briefly in this chapter...|$|R
40|$|As {{collaborative}} virtual environments (CVEs) {{are more}} widely used, participant access to CVE objects and information becomes a significant concern. In <b>virtual</b> reality games, <b>storefronts,</b> classrooms, and laboratories for example, {{the need to}} control access to spaces and objects is integral {{to the security of}} activities in these virtual realms. However, limited access controls are typically available in CVEs. Often, these mechanisms are course-grained, only protecting against movements by unauthorized participants into specific areas. In answer to this deficiency, we offer a discretionary access control (DAC) system based on the traditional concepts of users and groups, and tailored to the needs of a CVE. Our system, called WonderDAC, includes the ability to restrict movement into areas, as well as control interactions with objects. A basic WonderDAC prototype has been implemented within the Project Wonderland CVE...|$|R
