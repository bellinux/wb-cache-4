40|$|Objective. This paper {{describes}} {{the prediction of}} spinal forces in car occupants during <b>vertical</b> <b>vibrations</b> using a numerical multi-body occupant model. Background. An increasing {{part of the population}} is exposed to whole body vibrations in vehicles. In literature, <b>vertical</b> <b>vibrations</b> and low back pain are often related to each other. The cause of these low back pains is not well understood. A numerical human model, predicting intervertebral forces, can help to understand the mechanics of the human spine during <b>vertical</b> <b>vibrations.</b> Methods. Numerical human and seat models have been used. Human model responses have been validated for <b>vertical</b> <b>vibrations</b> (rigid and standard car seat condition) : simulated and experimental seat-to-human frequency response functions have been compared. The spinal shear and compressive forces have been investigated with the model. Results. The human model seat-to-pelvis and seat-to-T 1 frequency response functions in the rigid seat condition and all seat-to-human frequency response functions in the standard car seat condition approach the experimental results reasonably. The lumbar and the lower thoracic spine are subjected to the largest shear and compressive forces. Conclusions. The human model responses correlate reasonable with the volunteer responses. The predicted spinal forces {{could be used as a}} basis for derivation of hypothetical mechanisms and better understanding of low back pain disorders. Relevance In order to solve the problem of whole body vibration related injuries, knowledge about the interaction between human spinal vertebrae in <b>vertical</b> <b>vibrations</b> is required. This interaction cannot be measured in volunteer experiments. This paper {{describes the}} application of a numerical human model for prediction of spinal forces, that could be used as a basis for derivation of hypotheses regarding low back pain disorders. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|The {{more than}} 180 {{international}} peer reviewed studies about whole body vibration training show quite a variance in training results even in studies {{which seem to}} be comparable on first sight. This {{is partly due to}} device specific differences (e.g. side alternation vs. <b>vertical</b> <b>vibration,</b> large differences in training amplitudes and used frequencies) which makes the results of studies difficult to compare. In addition many study designs seem not to incorporate the basic rules of adaptation of the training intensity to the individual as described in modern training methodology. Further more the precise training parameters are mostly described only incompletely. As a result, it can often not be distinguished weather a negative outcome is related to vibration training itself or mainly to a lack of adaptation of the training to the abilities of the trainee.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{advanced}} patch-clamp recording techniques in brain slices, such as simultaneous recording from multiple neurons and recording from dendrites or presynaptic terminals, demands slices {{of the highest}} quality. In this context {{the mechanics of the}} tissue slicer are an important factor. Ideally, a tissue slicer should generate large-amplitude and high-frequency movements of the cutting blade in a horizontal axis, with minimal <b>vibrations</b> in the <b>vertical</b> axis. We developed a vibroslicer that fulfils these in part conflicting requirements. The oscillator is a permanent-magnet-coil-leaf-spring system. Using an auto-resonant mechano-electrical feedback circuit, large horizontal oscillations (up to 3 mm peak-to-peak) with high frequency (≈ 90 Hz) are generated. To minimize <b>vertical</b> <b>vibrations,</b> an adjustment mechanism was employed that allowed alignment of the cutting edge of the blade with the major axis of the oscillation. A vibroprobe device was used to monitor <b>vertical</b> <b>vibrations</b> during adjustment. The system is based on the shading of the light path between a light-emitting diode (LED) and a photodiode. Vibroprobe monitoring revealed that the vibroslicer, after appropriate adjustment, generated <b>vertical</b> <b>vibrations</b> of < 1 µm, significantly less than many commercial tissue slicers. Light- and electron-microscopic analysis of surface layers of slices cut with the vibroslicer showed that cellular elements, dendritic processes and presynaptic terminals are well preserved under these conditions, as required for patch-clamp recording from these structures...|$|R

50|$|The {{cylinder}} piston {{arrangement of the}} dashpot, i.e. the Lower Spring seat and the axle box guide is not fully sealed due to the limitation of the design and practical applicability. Its design provides that when a <b>vertical</b> <b>vibration</b> occurs during {{the movement of the}} railway coach, the axle box guide moves down. The downward movement of the Axle box guide puts pressure on the oil in the lower spring seat. The oil rushes up. However, since there are holes in the guide cap, the oil passes through these holes into the hollow body of the axle box guide. This helps in dampening the vertical vibrations. The axle box guide displaces the oil in the lower spring seat and pushes it upwards. Since, only part quantity of oil is able to move up in the hollow portion of the axle box guide, the balance displaced oil moves up.|$|E
50|$|Three {{civilian}} Electras {{were lost}} in fatal accidents between February 1959 and March 1960. Following the third crash the FAA restricted the maximum speed of Electras until the cause could be determined. After an extensive investigation, two of the crashes (in September 1959 and March 1960) {{were found to be}} caused by insufficiently strong engine mounts, unable to damp a whirling motion that could affect the outboard engines. When the oscillation was transmitted to the wings, a severe <b>vertical</b> <b>vibration</b> escalated until the wings were torn from the aircraft. The company implemented an expensive modification program, labelled the Lockheed Electra Achievement Program or LEAP, in which the engine mounts and wing structures supporting the mounts were strengthened, and some wing skins replaced with thicker material. All the surviving Electras of the 145 built at that time were modified at Lockheed's expense at the factory, the modifications taking 20 days for each aircraft. The changes were incorporated in subsequent aircraft as they were built.|$|E
50|$|We have no {{hesitation}} in affirming, {{that of all}} the timber bridges patented in this country, there are none, in point of strength, economy (in which we include ultimate durability), facility of repair, and uniformity of action, to be preferred before this plan of bridge lately patented by Mr. D. C. McCallum, of Oswego, engineer or ways and structures on the New York and Erie railroad.The bridge shown in elevation (see image) has been built lately for the New York and Erie railroad, at Lanesboro', over the Susquehanna river, in the place of one built by ourselves, several years since, under the orders, and according to the plan of the chief engineer of that road, but which proved unequal to the duty imposed upon it; and its removal became a matter of necessity.We objected to the plan of the original bridge, built in that locality, as we have ever done to any plan of bridge in which the attempt was made to unite the independent systems of arch and truss, and make toe stability of the bridge dependent upon their uniformity of action. In this plan of Mr. McCallum, the two principles are not independent as heretofore; but the action of the arch in the upper chord is made {{an integral part of the}} truss itself; and instead of two systems acting unequally, and to the ultimate injury of the structure, we have the best features of both united in a manner which admits of entire uniformity of action.In the construction of bridges for railroad purposes, two prominent difficulties have long been discovered, viz., a lack of sustaining principle towards the ends of the trusses and near the abutments, and an entire absence in many cases of a proper counteracting principle to prevent <b>vertical</b> <b>vibration</b> by a moving load.

40|$|Two virtual {{models of}} the ŠKODA 21 Tr low-floor {{trolleybus}} intended for the investigation of vertical dynamic properties during the simulation of driving on an uneven road surface are presented in the article. In order to solve analytically <b>vertical</b> <b>vibrations,</b> the trolleybus model formed by the system of four rigid bodies with seven degrees of freedom coupled by spring-damper elements is used.

The present physics-based, quantitative effort represents an initial systematic study on the UH- 60 A Black Hawk hub accelerations. The NASA/Army UH- 60 A Airloads Program flight test database was used. A 'maneuver-effect-factor (MEF) ', derived using the roll-angle and the pitch-rate, was used. Three neural network based representation-cases were considered. The pilot floor <b>vertical</b> <b>vibration</b> was considered {{in the first case}} and the hub accelerations were separately considered in the second case. The third case considered both the hub accelerations and the pilot floor <b>vertical</b> <b>vibration.</b> Neither the advance ratio nor the gross weight alone could be used to predict the pilot floor <b>vertical</b> <b>vibration.</b> However, the advance ratio and the gross weight together could be used to predict the pilot floor <b>vertical</b> <b>vibration</b> over the entire flight envelope. The hub accelerations data were modeled and found to be of very acceptable quality. The hub accelerations alone could not be used to predict the pilot floor <b>vertical</b> <b>vibration.</b> Thus, the hub accelerations alone do not drive the pilot floor <b>vertical</b> <b>vibration.</b> However, the hub accelerations, along with either the advance ratio or the gross weight or both, could be used to satisfactorily predict the pilot floor <b>vertical</b> <b>vibration.</b> The hub accelerations are clearly a factor in determining the pilot floor <b>vertical</b> <b>vibration...</b>|$|E
30|$|Figure  7 shows that, with an {{increase}} in vehicle suspension damping, the <b>vertical</b> <b>vibration</b> of the car body decreases at a frequency lower than 1  Hz and increases above 1  Hz.

40|$|This study {{determined}} how backrest inclination and {{the frequency}} and magnitude of <b>vertical</b> seat <b>vibration</b> influence vibration discomfort. Subjects experienced <b>vertical</b> seat <b>vibration</b> at frequencies in the range 2. 5 to 25 Hz at vibration magnitudes in the range 0. 016 to 2. 0 ms^- 2 r. m. s. Equivalent comfort contours were determined with five backrest conditions: no backrest, and with a stationary backrest inclined at 0 degree (upright), 30, 60 and 90 degree. Within all conditions, the frequency of greatest sensitivity to acceleration decreased with increasing vibration magnitude. Compared to an upright backrest, around the main resonance of the body, the vibration magnitudes required to cause similar discomfort were 100 % greater with 60 -degree and 90 -degree backrest inclinations and 50 % greater with a 30 -degree backrest inclination. It is concluded that no single frequency weighting provides an accurate prediction of the discomfort caused by <b>vertical</b> seat <b>vibration</b> at all magnitudes and with all backrest conditions.

30|$|In {{order to}} analyze the {{vibration}}, due to the natural vibration analysis of at-ground structure, {{the first and second}} frequency of vertical overall bend vibration is 32.9 and 62.4  Hz separately and at 88.2, 91.4, 97.2  Hz, there is frame’s local <b>vertical</b> <b>vibration.</b> So, the vibration peaks of frame’s center and bottom’s center are existed at this frequency. From the second vertical bend modal (62.4  Hz), the frame’s local <b>vertical</b> <b>vibration</b> modal appeared. So, before about 50  Hz, because of the overall <b>vertical</b> <b>vibration</b> of at-ground structure, the acceleration values of frame’s center and bottom’s center are nearly equal and between 50 and 100  Hz, and the acceleration of frame’s center is much bigger than bottom’s center acceleration based on the frame’s local <b>vertical</b> <b>vibration.</b> Therefore, the frame’s <b>vertical</b> <b>vibration</b> is high frequency (compared with the bottom’s vibration).|$|E
