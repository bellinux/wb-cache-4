The moving objects has been developed as a specific research area of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Most of the techniques {{have been used for}} performing the vehicle movement detection and prediction process. This type of work is a lack of analysis in predicting the moving <b>vehicles</b> <b>location</b> in current {{as well as in the}} future. Existing methods are using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) for finding optimal paths in moving objects. Within the previous technique, there’s no guarantee for fulfillment to finding a vehicle optimal path and also still now wants to improvement for choosing optimal path. To beat the disadvantage in the existing method, during this paper, to propose moving <b>vehicle</b> <b>location</b> prediction algorithm is an Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) and Feed Forward Back Propagation Neural Network (FFBNN). During this proposed algorithm is used for compute vehicle optimal path and selected optimal paths are given to the FFBNN to accomplish the training process. The trained FFBNN is then used to find the vehicle moving from the current location. By combining ABC algorithm and FFBNN, the moving <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>location</b> is predicted more efficiently. The outcomes of the FFBNN-ABC algorithm are compared with results of previous method, such as FFBNN-GA, FFBNN-PSO. The evaluation result shows that the proposed technique more accurate than other algorithms...|$|R
40|$|A radio <b>location</b> <b>method</b> for code-division multiple-access (CDMA) {{microcellular}} networks is investigated. The method discussed {{focuses on}} the use of time difference of arrival (TDOA) estimates for deriving the position of a mobile unit in a CDMA system, where the transmitted signal is received by several base stations (BSs). The TDOA estimates are obtained by using a delay-lock loop. A similar method is used in the global position system (GPS), but its performance in an urban microcellular propagation environment has not been previously studied. Simulation results are given for different radio propagation environments. I.

40|$|Considering {{features}} of <b>vehicle</b> license plate <b>location</b> <b>method</b> which commonly used, {{in order to}} search a consistent location for reference images with license plates feature in multidimensional parameter space, a new algorithm of geometric location is proposed. Geometric location algorithm main include model training and real time search. Which not only adapt the gray-scale linearity and the gray non-linear changes, but also support changes of scale and angle. Compared with the mainstream locating software, numerical results shows under the same test conditions that the position deviation of geometric positioning algorithm is less than 0. 5 pixel. Without {{taking into account the}} multidimensional parameter space, Geometric positioning algorithm position deviation is less than 1. 0 pixel and angle deviation is less than 1. 0 degree taking into account the multidimensional parameter space. This algorithm is robust, simple, practical and is better than the traditional method...|$|R
