40|$|Hydrological {{processes}} occurring {{within the}} vadose zone, especially in heterogeneous soils and tills {{typical of the}} Canadian shield, are not well understood. This research investigates {{the importance of the}} vadose zone in a small headwater basin (Harp 4 - 21) in the Canadian shield with respect to the generation of stream runoff quantity and quality during episodic rainfall and snowmelt events. The study focused specifically on: ﬁrstly the effect of variable antecedent moisture conditions on water-table and stream response, secondly, the significance of the stored <b>vadose</b> <b>water</b> in water extracted from a rising water-table, and thirdly the significance of preferential flowpathways in the vadose zone as a means of rapidly rotating, stored <b>vadose</b> <b>water</b> to the stream during runoff events. The instrumentation of the Harp 4 - 21 basin includes three v-notch weirs along the stream, numerous piezometers and wells, several soil lysimeters, and three tensiometer nests. Much of the data used in this study was obtained from five sites located along a hillslope transect. Soil water content at each of the hillslope sites was accurately determined using time domain reflectometry (TDR), whereas water table elevations were measured using both electronic water level tapes and calibrated rod ﬂoats. Preferential flowpath data was derived from ﬂow gauging and chemical analyses of water samples. Results obtained from the near-stream and lower slope reaches of the hillslope transect indicated that soil water content in the vadose zone is maintained at a high level of saturation by shallow water-table depths. Further analysis of simultaneously measured soil water content and depth to water—table data clearly showed that the existence of a thick essentially saturated zone overlying the water table (capillary fringe) was responsible for the large and rapid water-table responses observed during many of the nine studied precipitation events. On a basin scale, the seasonal variability of the area in which the capillary fringe extended to the ground surface was largely responsible for the observed trend in basin yield (runoff volume/ rainfall volume) for the nine runoff events. Chemical tracing results using silica, pH and DOC showed that the large <b>vadose</b> <b>water</b> reservoir in the near-stream and lower slope areas was a dominant component in water extracted from a rising water-table during most precipitation events. Silica results from the near-stream vadose zone showed that only the massive groundwater recharge associated with spring snowmelt could completely replace the <b>vadose</b> <b>water</b> reservoir with shorter residence time snowmelt/rainfall water. The rapid routing of stored near-stream capillary fringe <b>vadose</b> <b>water</b> through preferential pathways (macropores, soil pipes) was a significant source of runoff to the stream during runoff events. The presence of soil pipes, along with the significant <b>vadose</b> <b>water</b> reservoir in near-stream and lower slope areas are sufficient to explain the large phreatic/vadose water component typically identified in two component flow separation models, and constitutes the basis of a physically-based conceptual runoff model for the Harp 4 - 21 basin...|$|E

Although rhizons are primarily designed for soil moisture sampling, under suitable conditions water abstraction has been successful. <b>Vadose</b> <b>waters</b> have low pH of 3. 7 - 6. 2, mainly caused by the infiltration of acid atmospheric precipitations, rich on sulphates and nitrates and other components, which are subsequently involved in the formation and crystallization of salts.

40|$|We {{put forward}} a general {{conceptual}} model of CO 2 behaviour in the vadose zone of karst aquifers, based on physical principles of air flow through porous media and caves, combined with a geochemical interpretation of cave monitoring data. This ‘Gibraltar model’ links fluxes of water, air and carbon through the soil with the porosity of the vadose zone, the circulation of ground air and the ventilation of caves. Gibraltar hosts many natural caves whose locations span the full length and vertical range of the Rock. We report results of an 8 -year monitoring study of carbon in soil organic matter and bedrock carbonate, dissolved inorganic carbon in <b>vadose</b> <b>waters,</b> and gaseous CO 2 in soil, cave and ground air. Results show that the regime of cave air CO 2 results from the interaction of cave ventilation with a reservoir of CO 2 -enriched ground air held within the smaller voids of the bedrock. The pCO 2 of ground air, and of <b>vadose</b> <b>waters</b> {{that have been in}} close contact with it, are determined by multiple factors that include recharge patterns, vegetation productivity and root respiration, and conversion of organic matter to CO 2 within the soil, the epikarst and the whole vadose zone. Mathematical modelling and field observations show that ground air is subject to a density-driven circulation that reverses seasonally, as the difference between surface and underground temperatures reverses in sign. The Gibraltar model suggests that cave air pCO 2 is not directly related to CO 2 generated in the soil or the epikarstic zone, as is often assumed. Ground air CO 2 formed by the decay of organic matter (OM) washed down into the deeper unsaturated zone is an important additional source of pCO 2. In Gibraltar the addition of OM-derived CO 2 is the dominant control on the pCO 2 of ground air and the Ca-hardness of waters within the deep vadose zone. The seasonal regime of CO 2 in cave air depends on the position of a cave in relation to the density-driven ground air circulation pattern which is itself determined by the topography, {{as well as by the}} high-permeability conduits for air movement provided by caves themselves. In the steep topography of Gibraltar, caves in the lower part of the Rock act as outflow conduits for descending ground air in summer, and so have higher pCO 2 in that season. Caves in the upper Rock have high pCO 2 in winter, when they act as outflow conduits for rising currents of CO 2 -enriched ground air. Understanding seasonal flows of ground air in the vadose zone, together with the origins and seasonal regimes of CO 2 in cave air underpins robust interpretation of speleothem-based climate proxy records...|$|R

The study {{is based on}} the inverse modeling of highly defined soil column experiments and subsequent scenario modeling comparing different climate projections for a defined arid region. In arid regions, groundwater resources are prone to depletion due to excessive water use and little recharge potential. Especially in sand dune areas, groundwater recharge is highly dependent on vadose zone properties and corresponding <b>water</b> fluxes. Nevertheless, <b>vadose</b> zone <b>water</b> fluxes under arid conditions are hard to determine owing to, among other reasons, deep vadose zones with generally low fluxes and only sporadic high infiltration events. In this study, we present an inverse model of infiltration experiments accounting for variable saturated nonisothermal water fluxes to estimate effective hydraulic and thermal parameters of dune sands. A subsequent scenario modeling links the results of the inverse model with projections of a global climate model until 2100. The scenario modeling clearly showed the high dependency of groundwater recharge on precipitation amounts and intensities, whereas temperature increases are only of minor importance for deep infiltration. However, simulated precipitation rates are still affected by high uncertainties in the response to the hydrological input data of the climate model. Thus, higher certainty in the prediction of precipitation pattern is a major future goal for climate modeling to constrain future groundwater management strategies in arid regions...|$|R

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the study of}} fluid circulation of the Stromboli island using a dense coverage of self-potential (SP) and soil CO 2 data. A marked difference exists between the northern flank and the other flanks of the island. The northern flank exhibits (1) a typical negative SP/altitude gradient not observed on the other flanks, and (2) higher levels of CO 2. The general SP pattern suggests that the northern flank is composed of porous layers through which <b>vadose</b> <b>water</b> flows down to a basal water table, {{in contrast to the}} other flanks where impermeable layers impede the vertical flow of <b>vadose</b> <b>water.</b> In the Sciara del Fuoco and Rina Grande-Le Schicciole landslide complexes, breccias of shallow gliding planes may constitute such impermeable layers whereas elsewhere, poorly permeable, fine-grained pyroclastites or altered lava flows may be present. This general model of the flanks also explains the main CO 2 patterns: concentration of CO 2 at the surface is high on the porous north flank and lower on the other flanks where impermeable layers can block the upward CO 2 flux. The active upper part of the island is underlain by a well-defined hydrothermal system bounded by short-wavelength negative SP anomalies and high peaks of CO 2. These boundaries coincide with faults limiting ancient collapses of calderas, craters and flank landslides. The hydrothermal system is not homogeneous but composed of three main subsystems and of a fourth minor one and is not centered on the active craters. The latter are located near its border. This divergence between the location of the active craters and the extent of the hydrothermal system suggests that the internal heat sources may not be limited to sources below the active craters. If the heat source strictly corresponds to intrusions at depth around the active conduits, the geometry of the hydrothermal subsystems must be strongly controlled by heterogeneities within the edifice such as craters, caldera walls or gliding planes of flank collapse, as suggested by the correspondence between SP^CO 2 anomalies and structural limits. The inner zone of the hydrothermal subsystems is characterized by positive SP anomalies, indicating upward movements of fluids, and by very low values of CO 2 emanation. This pattern suggests that the hydrothermal zone becomes self-sealed at depth, thus creating a barrier to the CO 2 flux. In this hypothesis, the observed hydrothermal system is a shallow one and it involves mostly convection of infiltrated meteoric water above the sealed zone. Finally, on the base of CO 2 degassing measurements, we present evidence for the presence of two regional faults, oriented N 41 ‡ and N 64 ‡, and decoupled from the volcanic structures...|$|E

The isotopic composition of water stable isotopes (δ 18 O and δ 2 H) in water and sediment samples, from the area where desiccation crack networks prevail, indicated subsurface evaporation down to ~ 3. 5 m below land surface, and vertical and lateral preferential transport of water, following erratic preferential infiltration events.

40|$|Coastal {{ecosystems}} lie at {{the forefront}} of sea level rise. We posit that before the onset of actual inundation, sea level rise will influence the species composition of coastal hardwood hammocks and buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus L.) forests of the Everglades National Park based on tolerance to drought and salinity. Precipitation is the major water source in coastal hammocks and is stored in the soil vadose zone, but <b>vadose</b> <b>water</b> will diminish with the rising water table as a consequence of sea level rise, thereby subjecting plants to salt water stress. A model is used to demonstrate that the constraining effect of salinity on transpiration limits the distribution of freshwater-dependent communities. Field data collected in hardwood hammocks and coastal buttonwood forests over 11 years show that halophytes have replaced glycophytes. We establish that sea level rise threatens 21 rare coastal species in Everglades National Park and estimate the relative risk to each species using basic life history and population traits. We review salinity conditions in the estuarine region over 1999 – 2009 and associate wide variability in the extent of the annual seawater intrusion to variation in freshwater inflows and precipitation. We also examine species composition in coastal and inland hammocks in connection with distance from the coast, depth to water table, and groundwater salinity. Though this study focuses on coastal forests and rare species of South Florida, it has implications for coastal forests threatened by saltwater intrusion across the globe...|$|E

Detailed outcrop and petrographic examination of dolostone breccias and host rock reveals that palaeokarst was formed and affected by two distinct cycles of sea level change. A relative transgression resulted in deposition of lagoonal, ooid shoal, and shallow subtidal facies as sea level rose.

40|$|The {{quantification}} of <b>vadose</b> zone <b>water</b> fluxes in arid regions poses many difficulties due to {{low water}} input, coupled thermal and isothermal processes, {{spatial and temporal}} highly variable meteorological conditions and measurement deficits regarding spatial and temporal resolutions as well as measurement errors. Nevertheless, water flux processes in the vadose zone have to be understood and quantified as they govern rates of direct groundwater recharge. To quantify <b>vadose</b> zone <b>water</b> fluxes under controlled conditions, laboratory soil column experiments were developed that mimic atmospheric and soil water conditions {{as they can be}} expected in arid regions. The experimental setup allowed to measure water content and temperature distribution within a 92 cm deep soil profile in high temporal and spatial resolution. At the top of the column, a head space with controllable air stream, water input and applied temperature accounted for the simulation of changing atmospheric conditions. At the column bottom, temperature and outflow pressure were applied to obtain a temperature gradient within the column and water discharge under controlled pressure conditions. By applying different initial and boundary conditions, soil water dynamics and temperature distributions were studied for two different sands. Water content profiles, that were measured with a TDR “Taupe” cable, showed almost uniform infiltration fronts for steady-state experiments. Subsequent experimental runs indicated the high impact of irrigation amount and intensity on water infiltration, evaporation and redistribution within the sands. Obviously, only single irrigations exceeding potential evaporation and lasting long enough to infiltrate deeper than 20 cm, could account for discharge {{at the bottom of the}} column, depending on successively applied irrigations. According to the experiments, a numerical model was set up in Hydrus- 1 D, simulating coupled water, vapor and temperature fluxes in variably-saturated media (Šimunek et al., 2009). Hydraulic and thermal soil parameters, which are implemented into the model, were calibrated with experimental data of water content and temperature profiles at different times as well as transient water discharge and evaporation. Amongst the calibrated parameters, those controlling high saturated flow were less sensitive than those controlling evaporation and drainage, whereas highest sensitivities were obtained for the air entry pressure of the retention function of Brooks and Corey (1964). With the calibrated model, predictive scenario modeling was performed representing annual changing soil moisture conditions to identify parameters of primary importance for possible groundwater recharge in arid regions. The predictive modeling emphasized the high importance of single precipitation amounts on deep infiltration and percolation which can induce groundwater recharge. For annually low precipitation amounts, the residual water content of the ambient soil mainly determined percolation processes. Vapor fluxes, induced by temperature gradients, played a major role in total water fluxes under low saturated conditions. The laboratory experiments were a good tool for first estimates of <b>vadose</b> zone <b>water</b> fluxes under arid conditions and were essential for the model setup and calibration. Based on the calibrated model further predictions upon vertical water fluxes and deep percolation for critical meteorological conditions could be made. By this, the model offers a valuable tool for groundwater management issues, especially regarding smart field observation and measurement schemes and initial predictions on soil water states for expected future hydrological and microclimatological changes...|$|R
40|$|Ephemeral channel {{transmission}} loss represents an important groundwater-surface water exchange in arid and semiarid regions and is potentially a signi ficant source of recharge at the basin scale. However, {{identification of the}} processes and dynamics that control this exchange is a challenging problem. Specifically, data on the proportion of runoff {{transmission loss}}es that escape from near-channel transpiration and wetted channel evaporation to become deep groundwater recharge are difficult to obtain. This issue was addressed through coordinated field research and modeling within the USDA-ARS Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) located in the San Pedro River Basin of south eastern Arizona. Recharge was estimated using several independent methods which included a reach water balance approach, with near-channel ET estimated using sap flux and micrometeorological measurements; geochemical methods such as chloride mass balance; modeling of changes in groundwater level or microgravity measurements; and <b>vadose</b> zone <b>water</b> and temperature transport modeling.

40|$|The {{environmental}} isotope oxygen- 18 {{and natural}} water chemistry {{were used to}} identify both the percent individual source component and mechanisms responsible for generating summer surface storm runoff in a small Precambrian Shield catchment. In addition, variations in radon gas (Rn- 222) concentration in both surface and groundwaters were monitored {{in order to gain}} additional information not obtainable through use of the above stated tracers. Results indicate that the percent component contribution and the mechanism(s) responsible for stormflow generation within the study basin are largely dependent upon antecedent basin conditions and physical storm characteristics. Generally speaking, shortly after initiation of precipitation under any given antecedent condition a piston flow type mechanism operates delivering pre-event water (primarily phreatic zone water) to the stream channel. Rapid throughflow of water occurs during intense precipitation events as well as during wet antecedent conditions. The composition of throughflow is largely composed of event water. Under wet antecedent conditions throughflow is generally a mixture of event and pre-event waters. In this case pre-event <b>water</b> is primarily <b>vadose</b> zone <b>water...</b>|$|R
