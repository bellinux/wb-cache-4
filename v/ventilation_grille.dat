5|$|On 23 November 1984, during {{renovation}} works, {{the station}} suffered a severe fire which burned out the northbound Victoria line platform. It {{is believed that}} the fire was caused by smoking materials being pushed through a <b>ventilation</b> <b>grille</b> into a storeroom where they set several materials on fire. This caused the Victoria line between Warren Street and Victoria to be suspended until 18 December the same year. This incident also led to a smoking ban being introduced on trains in July 1984.|$|E
5000|$|The clochard {{does not}} work work, he carries out obligations. Everyone has his fiddle, or his [...] "defense" [...] (his way to fend for himself) {{that he will not}} give up to anyone else, and he jealously guards the secret. The clochard gets by during the night and often sleeps during the day {{wherever}} he is taken by fatigue, on a bench, a <b>ventilation</b> <b>grille,</b> even on the pavement or on the paths along the Seine Le Royaume d'Argot p260 ...|$|E
50|$|The {{fire started}} in a {{materials}} store {{at the south}} end of the northbound Victoria line platform, which was being used by contractors working on the modernisation of the station. It gutted the northbound Victoria line platform tunnel and the passages leading off it. The adjacent northbound Bakerloo line platform suffered smoke damage, as did the escalator tunnel and the booking hall. Other areas of the station were undamaged. The most likely cause of the fire was a smoker discarding smoking materials through a <b>ventilation</b> <b>grille</b> into the materials store, which ignited rags or paint thinner.|$|E

50|$|Visually, class P5b {{could be}} {{distinguished}} from a boxcab P5a by having a lower row of <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles</b> {{on the sides of}} the superstructure, and by having outside brake cylinders on the trucks.|$|R
50|$|To create {{sufficient}} {{room with}} the ZT 3 the hull was raised somewhat; the roof plates on the sides and front sloped towards {{the apex of the}} vehicle where a cast rotatable cupola provided the commander some height to observe his surroundings, in what was otherwise a very low and sleek construction. The gun was placed {{to the right of the}} driver with to its left a co-axial 7.5 mm machine-gun. There was an ammunition stock of eighty shells and 1200 bullets. As the position of the normal air intake was now occupied by the gun, a large roof <b>ventilation</b> <b>grille</b> was present above the third crew member, the gunner/loader. The fighting compartment was very cramped. No radio was present.|$|E
50|$|After World War II {{the former}} {{magazine}} was extended, possibly in 1948, {{the year of}} the dedication of the World War II Honour Board. The extension involved knocking down the east wall of the magazine, and adding a timber section on stumps, with the front door being reused in the north elevation of the extension. A narrow timber dining room was also added along the north elevation of the brick magazine, so that from the road the original brick structure is not visible. However the 1887 brick magazine building is still intact, complete with its original six narrow windows and their timber shutters. A timber coved ceiling, probably original, still exists in the old magazine section, along with a decorative <b>ventilation</b> <b>grille,</b> although a new ceiling extends partway into the old magazine section from the 1940s timber extension. During the 1950s the old floor and its square copper nails was replaced.|$|E
50|$|In 1935 {{the church}} was {{relocated}} when its site was acquired by the Jefferson County Board of Education {{to make room for}} construction of a new white-only segregated school that was to be built through a New Deal program. The school board bought the site at East Meeting Street and Lake Drive from an African-American Missionary Baptist congregation, and traded that property to the Christ Temple AME Zion congregation in exchange for the AME Zion church's site, so the new school could be built on the former AME Zion church property. The church's building was moved to the new site and rebuilt; the rebuilt building included parts of the 1888 building, but likely contained some new materials and elements. It is a single-story gable-front church building on a brick foundation, with weatherboard siding and a metal-covered roof. It has an arched recessed entranced with two-pane square windows on either side. There is a wood <b>ventilation</b> <b>grille</b> above the entrance at the gable point of the facade.|$|E
5000|$|VDNKh {{was opened}} on 1 May 1958. The name stands after Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy [...] (abbreviated VDNKh). The station {{features}} pylons faced with white marble {{and decorated with}} circular <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The ZT 4s {{differ from}} the [...] "ZT 1" [...] in having large <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles</b> at the sides and by a changed back, without stowage box, with a {{different}} rear-light and a shortened exhaust pipe.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of their commissioning, the Gem 4/4s were painted red with silver <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles.</b> Between 1986 and 1987, the livery was revised as follows: grey-brown frame, red body with bilingual logo and the cantonal shield of Graubünden.|$|R
50|$|The hall is {{accessed}} {{from both}} Quay Street and {{the rear of}} the office via a small foyer with double silky oak doors that open into the large hall. The hall floor is timber and the walls are sheeted and have a timber skirting. Acoustic sheets are attached at a high-level of the back wall. The coved ceiling consists of a grid of large, square sheets with timber cover strips, hanging fluorescent lights, and a long central feature panel <b>ventilation</b> <b>grille.</b> At the western end of the hall is a raised stage with proscenium accessed by stairs at either side. The stage is flanked by a small room either side; one contains a kitchen with original joinery, benchtop, sink, tapware, and tiled splashback, the other is a small backstage room with a set of timber stairs and provides access to the stage wing. The doors in the hall are clear-finished silky oak and the paint scheme throughout the hall appears to be original. Doors at the western end open out onto a short flight of concrete stairs into the concreted yard.|$|E
50|$|A major {{mid-cycle}} refresh débuted at the April 1986 Turin Motor Show. Changes {{were made}} to the exterior and interior of the car. Outside there were more modern, enveloping bumpers—the front one with provisions for integrated fog lights; the redesigned grille and bonnet bore a family resemblance to the flagship Thema. Also new were the <b>ventilation</b> <b>grille</b> on the C-pillar and full-wheel hubcaps. Inside new seats, new instrumentation and air conditioning system.The 1986 range included seven models, two of them all-new: 1.3, 1.5, 1.5 Automatica, 1.6, 1.6 i.e., 4WD, diesel and turbo ds. 1.3 and 1.5 models had revised intake and exhaust system, fuel cut-off, a new carburettor and breakerless ignition. The diesel versions had also received some minor engine updates, and the turbo diesel had been renamed turbo ds.The new Prisma 1.6 i.e. used a version of the 1585 cc twin-cam engine equipped with Weber-Marelli IAW integrated electronic ignition and fuel injection system, developing 108 PS. In comparison to the carburetted Prisma 1600—which remained on sale as Prisma 1.6—further changes had been made: the cylinder head had been rotated 180°, bringing the exhaust side to the front for better cooling, and the whole engine was canted forward 18° to lower its centre of gravity.|$|E
5000|$|France, however, {{had such}} a dearth of modern tanks {{that it could not}} afford to forget the twelve pre-series vehicles. In January 1936 they were taken into use with the 4th Cuirasssiers, at first fitted with gun turrets removed from Renault FTs and then with the APX1 turret also used for the Char D2s, armed with an SA34 47 mm gun. By 1937 the growing {{production}} of more modern tanks allowed the AMC 34 hulls to be shipped from France to Morocco to be used by the 1e Régiment Chasseurs d'Afrique, which received them on 15 December 1937. They were at the time the most modern armoured vehicles in the colonies, but were refitted with the two-man APX2 turret. It took many months before 25 mm guns could be fitted as well; until that time the tanks drove around with just the 7.5 mm machine guns. The tanks used the ER 28 short wave radio (all AMCs were supposed to have radio sets); also a better protected fuel tank at the back was installed together with a safer horizontal <b>ventilation</b> <b>grille</b> on the back engine deck. In November 1939 the AMC 34 was replaced by the [...] "H 39"; three vehicles were taken by 5 RCA and used for driver training. These and the other nine vehicles do not appear on the armistice control lists, so they were either already scrapped in the summer of 1940 or hidden.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe need of {{increasing}} both energy saving and acoustic insulation has leaded {{to the design}} of lowest air permeability frames resulting in the worsening of indoor air quality. Moreover, sometime in several civil-use existing buildings (i. e. schools or houses, historical buildings) mechanical ventilation systems cannot be installed due to non-removable constraints. In these cases, passive <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles</b> are a cheap and effective solution for the ventilation. This work deals with an in-depth experimental analysis about the air permeability values measured over a set of passive <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles</b> available on the market. Obtained results often showed performances very far to those declared. This is not due to multiplicity of involved parameters affecting their behaviour rather to a lack of standardized test methods...|$|R
50|$|Kurskaya (Курская) is {{a station}} on the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line of the Moscow Metro. It is named for the Kursky railway station located nearby. Designed by L. M. Polyakov and {{completed}} in 1938, the station has tiled walls and gray marble pylons with sconce light fixtures and circular <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{the bank}} {{contains}} fine decorative elements. It has plaster ceilings with elaborately decorated plaster cornices, ceiling roses and beam encasings. Timber work includes finely carved and turned stairs, and panelled cedar doors with ventilated fanlights. The public banking area contains a particularly impressive richly carved counter inset with <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of timber buildings built in North Queensland have traditionally relied on use of elevation, verandahs, and cross ventilation from windows to keep them cool. More elaborate conventions included regulating fanlights, ceiling vents and louvered openings {{on both sides of}} the roof or in gable ends. The second Innisfail court house incorporates these more common ventilation features with more advanced techniques. Plans and sections showing extensions to the building in 1933 reveal an elaborate ventilation system to cope with Innisfail's hot and humid climate. The system featured latticed ventilation spaces in the ceiling that delivered hot air into pipes in the ceiling and out through a cupola-shaped ventilation fleche in a decorative casing on the court house roof. Although not in use since the building's removal from Innisfail in 1988, the necessary elements of the ventilation system are still present in the ceiling. Bell (1984:178) confirms that intact examples of ceiling ventilation such as this are rare, as many have been removed or destroyed during installation of electric lights or ceiling fans. At floor level in the courtroom the lowest wallboards were hinged so they could be opened to increase airflow. Fanlights, sash windows and louvres assisted with ventilation. In 1934 a <b>ventilation</b> <b>grille</b> was installed behind the Judge's Bench and casement windows installed in the Jury's Room. Although electric fans were first installed in 1938, and by 1990 there were 18 fans in the building, these upgrades have not affected the material fabric of the system.|$|E
40|$|A {{program of}} {{experimental}} fires {{has been carried}} out to assess fire containment and other fire hazards in lavatory and cargo compartments of wide-body jet aircraft by evaluation of ignition time, burn-through time, fire spread rate, smoke density, evolution of selected combustible and toxic gases, heat flux, and detector response. Two tests were conducted: one involving a standard Boeing 747 lavatory and one involving a simulated DC- 10 cargo compartment. A production lavatory module was furnished with conventional materials and was installed in an enclosure. The ignition load was four polyethylene bags containing paper and plastic waste materials representive of a maximum flight cabin waste load. Standard aircraft ventilation conditions were utilized and the lavatory door was closed during the test. Lavatory wall and ceiling panels contained the fire spread during the 30 -minute test. Smoke was driven into the enclosure primarily through the <b>ventilation</b> <b>grille</b> in the door and through the gaps between the bifold door and the jamb where the door distorted from the heat earlier in the test. The interior of the lavatory was almost completely destroyed by the fire...|$|E
50|$|The shop {{is intact}} and by its display space, working area and {{strongroom}} {{has the potential}} to demonstrate {{the way in which the}} business of a small manufacturing jeweller of the period was run.The large timber <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles</b> beneath the windows also show adaptation to the needs of a tropical climate.|$|R
50|$|Loco 2302 {{was given}} <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles</b> like those on Classes 11-12-21-27 as a test. These were mounted high on each side. The {{original}} openings were blanked in and each {{fitted with a}} porthole. No other Class 23s were ever had these. 2302 retained this arrangement {{until the end of}} its service life.|$|R
50|$|Like {{almost any}} {{locomotive}} class, the Little Joes were occasionally involved in wrecks. One such, in 1966, {{resulted in the}} E78 being rebuilt (back east in the Milwaukee Shops) to a slightly different appearance from the other 11 units, due {{to the use of}} a pair of stainless steel side <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles</b> intended for use on EMD F-units.|$|R
50|$|The general ward {{buildings}} are two storey I-shaped masonry buildings with hipped corrugated iron roofs. The red-brown English-bond face brick walls are relieved with banding at sill and floor levels, contrasting lintels and multi-paned sash and frame windows. Subtle {{differences between the}} construction periods of the pairs of wards {{is evident in the}} joinery treatment, window shutter details and <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{types of}} objects {{naturally}} suit or even require openwork, which allows {{a flow of}} air through screens, censers or incense burners, pomanders, sprinklers, <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles</b> and panels, and various parts of heating systems. For exterior screens openwork designs allow looking out, but not looking in. For gates {{and other types of}} screens, security is required, but visibility may also be wanted.|$|R
50|$|When the Argyle Line {{was opened}} in 1979, Glasgow Cross station was not reopened, being {{replaced}} by the new Argyle Street station to the west. Today {{it is now a}} ghost station and at surface level the only evidence of its existence are decorative <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles</b> on the traffic island, between Trongate and London Road, whilst at track level there is a widening of the formation.|$|R
50|$|Full {{production}} {{started in}} 1965, continuing to 1976 with loco EF64 79. Minor variations within the class included the discontinuation {{of the cab}} <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles</b> above the marker lights from EF64 46 onward. Locos EF64 1 to 12 and EF64 29 to 55 were equipped with train-heating generators for passenger use, and are distinguishable by the train heating indicator lights next to the cab doors. The DT120A/DT121A bogies were virtually identical to those used on the Class EF70.|$|R
40|$|The {{store is}} {{situated}} on an extremely narrow block. The large timber <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles</b> beneath the windows show {{adaptation to the}} needs of a tropical climate. The shop was brilliantly lit with electric light, had expensive and fashionable fittings and two striking semicircular display windows made of curved plate glass. These windows are the only known example of this type in Queensland. Information taken from: Environmental Protection Agency, 2006, retrieved 21 April 2008, from www. epa. qld. gov. a...|$|R
5000|$|Smolenskaya has square, {{white marble}} columns with fluted corners, {{decorative}} cornices, and <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles</b> concealed behind ornamental sconces. At {{the end of}} the platform is a bas-relief by G.I. Motovilov entitled [...] "The Defenders of Russia," [...] which depicts soldiers of the Red Army in battle. The architects of the station were Igor Rozhin and G. P. Yakovlev. At 50 m below the surface, Smolenskaya was the deepest station on the line until Park Pobedy opened in 2003.|$|R
5|$|Militants {{continued}} to {{fire at the}} SSG commandos from <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles</b> in the basement. During the firefight, Abdul Rashid Ghazi {{was shot in the}} leg and was asked to surrender. However, militants in the room fired back at the SSG, and Ghazi was killed in the crossfire. Other reports say that Ghazi came out of a bunker to surrender, only to be shot by his own forces. The fighting continued until all the personnel trapped in the basement either surrendered or were killed.|$|R
50|$|The station {{opened in}} 1938, its {{architect}} was Alexey Dushkin. The station features {{red and yellow}} marble arches resting on low pylons faced with black Armenian marble. The spaces between the arches are partially filled by decorative <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles</b> and ceiling tracery. Each arch is flanked {{by a pair of}} bronze sculptures by Matvey Manizer depicting the people of the Soviet Union, including soldiers, farmers, athletes, writers, aviators, industrial workers, and schoolchildren. There are a total of 76 sculptures in the station.|$|R
50|$|Lyall's Jewllery Shop is a small, single story shop {{constructed}} of rendered brick. It has an unusually fine shop front with a recessed entrance between two large display windows of curved plate glass, above ornate timber <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles.</b> Panels of small, coloured glass panes are above the windows. Another large display window glazed with flat glass {{is to the}} side of the shop. There is a gas light over the doorway. The original cedar panelled doors survive, as do sash windows in the side and rear walls.|$|R
50|$|It was {{designed}} by S. Kravets, Yu. Kolesnikova, and G. Golubev and opened on 1 May 1958. The station was originally planned to be as heavily decorated as previous stations, but the design was modified due to Khrushchev's opposition to unnecessary decorative elements. As a result, Alexeyevskaya has surprisingly clean lines for a station built in the 1950s. Its octagonal pylons are white marble with green stripes, and the arches, ceiling, and <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles</b> are painted white. Lighting comes from restrained yet elegant chandeliers.|$|R
50|$|Avtovo's {{unique and}} highly ornate design {{features}} columns faced with ornamental glass manufactured at the Lomonosov factory. Although {{the original plan}} envisaged using glass {{on all of the}} columns in the station, white marble was substituted on some due to time constraints. This marble was supposed to be temporary, but it has never been replaced. The walls are faced with white marble and adorned on the north side by a row of ornamental <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles.</b> At the end of the platform a mosaic by V.A. Voronetskiy and A.K. Sokolov commemorates the Leningrad Blockade (1941-1944) during the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|The VL2C further {{upgraded}} {{the light}} source to 600 W, {{driven by an}} APS600-X lamp PSU. The internal ventilation system was accordingly redesigned to better cool the head—especially the colour / gobo wheels and the beam iris leaves were upgraded for better heat resistance. The speed of the cooling fan was also increased—which led to some complaints (especially from TV studios) about noise. Detachable, external baffles were designed to cover the <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles</b> {{in the side of}} the luminaire's Upper Enclosure (UPE), in order to deal with this issue; but could occasionally cause overheating in warm environments, leading to lamp shutdown.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{design of the}} Rex included a variety of ornate features; the designer is not known but it {{is assumed to be}} the work of Mollo and Egan who collaborated with Nye on other cinema interiors. The Rex interior featured stylised floral stucco friezes around the dining room, a striking decorated foyer ceiling rose, and the nautical flavour set by Nye's dining room porthole windows was continued with the addition of scallop shell-shaped light fittings and stucco waves in the auditorium. The main screen itself was surrounded by an ornate proscenium, with Art Deco floral designs obscuring the <b>ventilation</b> <b>grilles.</b>|$|R
