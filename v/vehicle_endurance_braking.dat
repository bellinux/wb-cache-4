40|$|Abstract – The solar-powered {{autonomous}} {{underwater vehicle}} (SAUV) was designed for long-endurance missions, such as monitoring, surveillance, or station-keeping, where real-time bi-directional communications to shore are critical. In April 2006, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Division Newport, Falmouth Scientific Inc. (FSI), and Autonomous Undersea Systems Institute (AUSI) conducted a 30 -day, long-endurance test using SAUV II primarily {{to demonstrate that the}} vehicle is capable of conducting long-term oceanographic data collection and to validate the vehicle’s mechanical integrity. This test also served to evaluate possible anomalies and risk-reduction measures for future production-level vehicles. A key part of this long-endurance test was the logging of the SAUV II charge and discharge rates under different sky and weather conditions with the vehicle under varied energy load situations—data {{that can be used to}} assess <b>vehicle</b> <b>endurance</b> and help establish future mission capabilities of the SAUV II.

40|$|Preliminary {{performance}} analysis and conceptual design are described {{for a class}} of unmanned airplanes possessing multi-day endurance capability. A mixed-mode electric power system incorporates solar cells for daytime energy production and a non-regenerative H 2 - 02 fuel cell to supply energy for night flight. The power system provides energy for all onboard systems, including propulsion., payload, and avionics.

Initial calculations for summertime, high-altitude flight (above 40, 000 ft (12 km)) at moderate latitude (31 deg N) indicate that mission endurance of several days may be possible for configurations having wing loadings on the order of 0. 9 to 1. 3 lb/ft(exp 2).

They allow for the prolonged presence of scientific instruments in the ocean, enabling the collection of samples for several weeks or {{months at a time}} for {{a fraction of the cost}} of research vessels. These vehicles share common characteristics and constraints with other cyber-physical systems that include concerns for vehicle safety, a limited energy supply, the optimization and trade-off of resources, sporadic communication, and operation in extremely constrained environments.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a variety of High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) conceptual designs for two operationally useful missions (hurricane science and communications relay) and compare their performance and cost characteristics. Sixteen potential HALE UAV configurations were initially developed, including heavier-than-air (HTA) and lighter-than-air (LTA) concepts with both consumable fuel and solar regenerative (SR) propulsion systems. Through an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) down select process, the two leading consumable fuel configurations (one each from the HTA and LTA alternatives) and an HTA SR configuration were selected for further analysis. Cost effectiveness analysis of the consumable fuel configurations revealed that simply maximizing <b>vehicle</b> <b>endurance</b> can lead to a sub-optimum system solution. An LTA concept with a hybrid propulsion system (solar arrays and a hydrogen-air proton exchange membrane fuel cell) was found to have the best mission performance; however, an HTA diesel-fueled wing-body-tail configuration emerged as the preferred consumable fuel concept because of the large size and technical risk of the LTA concept.

40|$|Currently a 50 gram micro quad rotor {{vehicle is}} being {{developed}} in collaboration with Daedalus Flight Systems. Optimization of the design at this scale requires a systematic study {{to be carried out}} to investigate the factors that affect the <b>vehicles</b> performance. <b>Endurance</b> of hovering <b>vehicles</b> at this scale is severely limited by the low efficiencies of their propulsion systems and rotor design and optimization has been performed in the past in an attempt to increase endurance, but proper coupling of the rotor with the motor has been lacking. The current study chose to investigate the factors that had the greatest effect on the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>endurance</b> through analysis of the propulsion system. Therefore, a coupled aerodynamic and structural analysis was carried out that incorporated low Reynolds number airfoil table lookup in order to predict micro rotor performance. A parametric study on rotor design was performed further determine the effect of different rotor designs on hover performance. The experiments performed showed that airfoil camber had the biggest impact on rotor efficiency and other factors such as leading edge shape, number of blades, max camber location, and blade planform taper only had negligible influence on performance. Systematic studies of the interactions between micro rotor blades operating in close proximity to each other were performed {{in order to determine the}} changes in rotor efficiency that might occur in a compact quad rotor design. Tests done on the effect of rotor separation demonstrated that there is a negligible interaction between rotors operating near each other. Brushless motors were also tested systematically and characterized by their torque, rpm, and efficiency. It was found that the maximum efficiency of the motors tested was only 60 %, which has significant effects on the efficiency of the coupled system. A method for rotor and motor coupling was also established that utilized the motor efficiency curves and the known torque and rotational speed of the rotors at their operating thrust.

40|$|The thesis investigates {{a method}} to {{estimate}} the forward velocity and heading rate of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Through relatively new technologies small AUVs {{are now able to}} mount a Forward Looking Sonar (FLS) on the vehicle's nose. This can be used for obstacle avoidance and feature based navigation. The sensor {{can also be used to}} estimate motion of the AUV, which can be useful for undersea navigation. The thesis focuses on a template matching technique used in computer vision. Two sequential sonar images are compared with the goal of finding the rotation and translation that best correlates the first to the second sonar image. The transformation which maximizes the correlation coefficient is then converted to forward velocity and heading rate through motion analysis. Experimentation shows that the method provides accurate estimates for both the forward velocity and heading rate of the AUV. Accuracy of the estimates for forward velocity was at the limitation of the resolution of the sonar. Using velocities estimated through image processing applied to FLS images entirely with software, the weight and energy resources currently required by standard measurement techniques could be used to increase the <b>vehicles</b> <b>endurance</b> or for additional payload capacity. Another benefit would be the reduction in acoustic and electrical interference with the FLS and side scan sonar, which would improve the vehicle's obstacle avoidance and mine-hunting capability. The vehicle could become more flexible in its capability to support additional roles vice specific missions. This method holds the promise for permitting smaller AUVs with a FLS to navigate undersea more accurately. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R

The hydraulic dampers in conventional suspension systems are mainly designed with the orifices of the piston; however, the vibration energy will be transferred into waste heat. In recent years, conventional vehicles with internal combustion engines and hybrid vehicles are used commonly. However, with the gradual depletion of fossil fuels, electric vehicles are developing. For this reason, the research focuses on recycling energy from the suspension of vehicles to improve the <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>endurance.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop a semi-active suspension control system with an energy harvesting system. Instead of the fixed orifices in conventional vehicles, an adjusting damping force method with variable resistance circuits system is studied for the semi-active suspension control system. Thus, we are able to develop semi-active control to improve the riding comfort. The energy harvesting system contains a hydraulic gear motor and a DC generator. When vehicles vibrate, the hydraulic damper serves as a hydraulic pump to compress the oil and drive the hydraulic motor. At the same time, the hydraulic motor drives the generator to generate electricity which will be stored in a battery. In this study, the test rig is the quarter-car system. We first design the novel hydraulic suspension system combining with the energy harvesting system. The simulation of dynamic mathematical model will be performed and analyzed by MATLAB/Simulink. Besides that, the semiactive control by the fuzzy sliding mode controller will be realized in the hydraulic suspension system with energy harvesting system.

Vehicles specifically designed for hover flight have their own possible applications, including the formation of high gain airborne phased antenna arrays. With this specific application in mind, the Cornell Autonomous Flying Vehicle (AFV) team sought to produce a four rotor hovering vehicle capable of eventual untethered acrobatic autonomous flights. The mechanical design of the AFV included both {{the selection of a}} battery-motor-gearing-prop combination for efficient thrust production and the design of a lightweight yet sufficiently stiff vehicle structure. The components chosen were selected from the variety of brushless motors, battery technologies and cell configurations, and fixed pitch propellers suited to use in a four rotor hovering vehicle. The vehicle structure settled upon achieved a high degree of stiffness with minimal weight through the use of thin walled aluminum compression members supported by stranded steel cable. In addition to an efficient mechanical design, the vehicle also required onboard control and inertial navigation. In order to evaluate a variety of potential vehicle sensor, actuator, estimation, and control scenarios, a fully configurable nonlinear simulation of vehicle and sensor dynamics was also constructed. For the current iteration of the vehicle, a square root implementation of a Sigma Point Filter was used for estimation while a simple Linear Quadratic Regulator based on the nonlinear vehicle dynamics linearized about hover provided vehicle control. Sensory feedback on the current vehicle included an onboard inertial measurement unit and a human observer, to be eventually replaced by GPS or an indoor equivalent. While a hardware failure prevented the completion of a full range of tests, the team was able to complete a hands-free hover test that demonstrated the capabilities of the vehicle.
