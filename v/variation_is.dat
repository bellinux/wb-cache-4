5|$|Mutual {{intelligibility}} {{among these}} ASL varieties is high, and the <b>variation</b> <b>is</b> primarily lexical. For example, {{there are three}} different words for English about in Canadian ASL; the standard way, and two regional variations (Atlantic and Ontario), {{as shown in the}} videos on the right. Variation may also be phonological, meaning that the same sign may be signed in a different way depending on the region. For example, an extremely common type of <b>variation</b> <b>is</b> between the handshapes /1/, /L/, and /5/ in signs with one handshape.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature in}} the non-dipolar part of the secular <b>variation</b> <b>is</b> a westward drift {{at a rate of}} about 0.2 degrees per year. This drift is not the same everywhere and has varied over time. The globally averaged drift has been westward since about 1400 AD but eastward between about 1000 AD and 1400 AD.|$|E
50|$|<b>Variations</b> <b>are</b> nested in brackets, {{and also}} usually {{assigned}} letters. The first branch (<b>variation</b> A) <b>is</b> the main branch.|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} anisotropic, plasma-fluid <b>variations</b> <b>was</b> used to {{investigate}} the unknown origin of the power spectra of interstellar electron fluctuations inferred by Armstrong, Cordes, and Rickett (1981). The modeled electron <b>variations</b> <b>are</b> interpreted as density components of an anisotropic stationary mode of nonlinear magnetogasdynamics-tangential pressure balances. It is suggested that the wavenumber spectra of electron <b>variations</b> <b>are</b> identical to the spectra of the convecting velocity fields {{over a wide range}} of wavenumbers...|$|R
50|$|Dvořák's Symphonic <b>Variations</b> <b>are</b> {{among the}} three most {{frequently}} played of all sets of orchestral variations, along with Brahms's Variations on a Theme by Haydn and Elgar's Enigma Variations. Hubert Parry's Symphonic <b>Variations</b> <b>were</b> doubtlessly influenced by Dvořák's example.|$|R
5|$|During 1997–1999, Conservation International {{conducted}} {{a survey of the}} coral reef in the area. According to the survey, the coral diversity is relatively low, but fish species <b>variation</b> <b>is</b> rich. Some species found during the survey include Pogonoperca ocellata, Chaetodon gardneri, Chaetodon xanthocephalus, Centropyge flavipectoralis, Genicanthus caudovittatus, Halichoeres cosmetus, Stethojulis albovittatus, Scarus enneacanthus, Scarus scaber and Zebrasoma desjardinii.|$|E
5|$|The Adler <b>variation</b> <b>is</b> {{named after}} the game Adler–Maróczy, played at the 1896 Budapest tournament. White is ready to return the e5-pawn {{in order to develop}} his pieces on their best squares, i.e. the d5-square for the Nb1, the f3-square for the Ng1 and the a1–h8 {{diagonal}} for the Bc1.|$|E
5|$|The Fajarowicz <b>variation</b> <b>is</b> said to {{have its}} origins in the chess circles from Leipzig, with the first {{important}} game being H.Steiner–Fajarowicz at the 1928 Wiesbaden tournament. In this variation, Black makes no immediate effort to regain the gambit pawn, preferring to concentrate on active piece play and tactical tricks.|$|E
50|$|Many {{footwork}} <b>variations</b> can <b>be</b> done {{independently of}} the partner. The three most common footwork <b>variations</b> <b>are</b> single, double, and triple time.|$|R
50|$|Intra-author <b>variations</b> <b>are</b> {{the ways}} in which one author's texts differ from each other. Inter-author <b>variations</b> <b>are</b> {{the ways in}} which {{different}} authors' writing varies. Two texts by one author do not necessarily vary less than texts by two different authors.|$|R

5|$|The Fianchetto <b>Variation</b> <b>is</b> often reached via {{transposition}} {{from other}} openings.

5|$|Tropical glaciers {{are located}} between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, {{in the region}} that lies 23° 26′ 22″ north or south of the equator. Strictly, a {{tropical}} glacier is located within the astronomical tropics; the area where the annual temperature <b>variation</b> <b>is</b> less than the daily variation, and is within the oscillation area of the Intertropical Convergence Zone.|$|E
5|$|Within the UK, {{the most}} common <b>variation</b> <b>is</b> to use lamb instead of mutton. Gloucester Squab pie did not require lamb and {{suggests}} any leftover meat could be used. Other ingredients can be included, for example Agatha Christie produced a variant which included hard-boiled eggs and another recipe took the concept of serving with clotted cream and adds cream to thicken.|$|E
30|$|The {{follow-up}} test {{into the}} artifact-like features revealed that these {{variations in temperature}} and discontinuities remain present. If these <b>variations</b> <b>were</b> due to experimental setup, the surface temperature profile should have changed when it was rotated. If the <b>variations</b> <b>were</b> due to sample preparation, then the surface temperature profile would also have changed. The follow-up test showed that the surface temperature profile remained constant leading {{to the conclusion that}} these <b>variations</b> <b>are</b> the result of a microstructural defect in the specimen.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Annual and {{seasonal}} variations of individual weights of dominant species of aquatic insects in Breitenbach, Germany, are described and the probable reasons of <b>variations</b> <b>are</b> discussed. <b>Variations</b> <b>are</b> not correlated in different species, and {{there appears to}} be no uniform explanation of the phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{performed}} both intra- and interspecific {{comparisons of}} the Otx gene in the sea urchin to investigate DNA variations within the enhancer elements. Intraspecific comparisons within Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus showed that indel <b>variations</b> <b>were</b> rare within the Otx enhancer, whereas SNP <b>variations</b> <b>were</b> found uniformly within the whole test region. A similar pattern of DNA <b>variation</b> <b>was</b> observed in comparisons between closely related species. On the other hand, both nucleotide substitution and indel <b>variations</b> <b>were</b> at high levels between distant species. Additionally, the regions corresponding to the Otx enhancer in two related species showed substantial activities during development. Our results suggest {{the possibility that a}} stabilizing selection has occurred during the evolution of the Otx gene enhancer in the sea urchin that maintains its expression pattern...|$|R
5|$|A {{central point}} of debate on GWA studies {{has been that}} most of the SNP {{variations}} found by GWA studies are associated with only a small increased risk of the disease, and have only a small predictive value. The median odds ratio is 1.33 per risk-SNP, with only a few showing odds ratios above 3.0. These magnitudes are considered small because they do not explain much of the heritable variation. This heritable <b>variation</b> <b>is</b> known from heritability studies based on monozygotic twins. For example, it is known that 80-90% of variance in height can be explained by hereditary differences, but GWA studies only account for a minority of this variance.|$|E
5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects {{the upper part of}} the main sequence in the region of class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars in this part of the instability strip that intersects {{the upper part of the}} main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this <b>variation</b> <b>is</b> difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E
5|$|A {{prerequisite}} for natural selection {{to result in}} adaptive evolution, novel traits and speciation {{is the presence of}} heritable genetic variation that results in fitness differences. Genetic <b>variation</b> <b>is</b> the result of mutations, genetic recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However, many mutations in non-coding DNA have deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, a majority of mutations in humans are slightly deleterious.|$|E
40|$|Significant {{opportunities}} for energy savings are {{identified in the}} hot and warm water system of a kraft pulp mill. Short-term variations in the process are studied {{in order to identify}} and quantify the influences of these variations on the energy-saving opportunities. Daily and ten-minute averages of measured data are used as varying input data in a heat exchanger network with fixed heat transfer areas. When the short-term <b>variations</b> <b>are</b> considered, the total energy savings are decreased by about 10 %. The steam-saving opportunities correspond to at least 5 % of the mill’s total steam use, when the short-term <b>variations</b> <b>are</b> considered. At least 65 % of the influences of short-term <b>variations</b> <b>are</b> detected already when the seasonal <b>variations</b> <b>are</b> considered...|$|R

50|$|WR 1 is {{slightly}} variable {{and given the}} designation V863 Cassiopeiae. The total amplitude of the <b>variations</b> <b>is</b> only 0.09 magnitudes at visual wavelengths. The <b>variations</b> <b>are</b> well-defined with a period of 16.9 days, but the light curve is not sinusoidal and its shape may vary. The <b>variations</b> have <b>been</b> ascribed to a dense asymmetric stellar wind and co-rotating interacting regions in ejected material.|$|R
5|$|HIV-1 {{infection}} causes chronic ongoing {{inflammation and}} production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, the HIV genome may be vulnerable to oxidative damages, including breaks in the single-stranded RNA. For HIV, {{as well as for}} viruses generally, successful infection depends on overcoming host defensive strategies that often include production of genome-damaging reactive oxygen. Thus, Michod et al. suggested that recombination by viruses is an adaptation for repair of genome damages, and that recombinational <b>variation</b> <b>is</b> a byproduct that may provide a separate benefit.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Pablo Jayat {{and colleagues}} {{reviewed}} {{the members of}} the Akodon boliviensis species group, including A.spegazzinii, in Argentina. They could not find clear differentiation in either morphological or molecular characters between animals belonging to A.alterus, A.leucolimnaeus, A.spegazzinii, and A.tucumanensis, and consequently concluded that they all represent a single species. Although genetic <b>variation</b> <b>is</b> relatively high within A.spegazzinii, there is no clear geographic structure among haplotypes from different regions. The next year, Ulyses Pardiñas and colleagues concluded that A.oenos, which had formerly, and incorrectly, been placed in the A.varius species group, was in fact another synonym of A.spegazzinii. The proliferation of scientific names for this one species occurred because of the terseness of the original description of A.spegazzinii, and a lack of large samples and of appreciation of the substantial variation occurring within A.spegazzinii.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} {{to play the game}} with just two players (one per team) by having each player move on two boards. Analogously to simultaneous chess, this way of playing the game is referred to as simultaneous bughouse. It can also be played with just one clock by playing the boards in a specific order (WhiteA, WhiteB, BlackB, BlackA) and pressing the clock after each move. This <b>variation</b> <b>is</b> suitable for play by mail.|$|E

40|$|Ultraviolet optical {{observations}} of the BL Lacertae object, PG 1553 + 11, indicate that significant color <b>variations</b> <b>are</b> associated with the luminosity variations seen in the ultraviolet and the optical regions of the spectrum.

5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{will only}} cause evolution {{if there is}} enough genetic variation in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common hypothesis was blending inheritance. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural selection implausible. The Hardy–Weinberg principle provides the solution to how <b>variation</b> <b>is</b> maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. The frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant {{in the absence of}} selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.|$|E
5|$|No {{subspecies}} are recognised, and {{the degree}} of geographic <b>variation</b> <b>is</b> unclear. Adult male birds which breed on the mainland have been reported as having lighter upperparts and underparts than their Tasmanian relatives, and females are said to be browner, but these differences may also result from worn plumage. Furthermore, migration across the Bass Strait by some birds obfuscates the issue. Mainland and Tasmanian birds are the same size. Ornithologists Richard Schodde and Ian Mason argued that the poor quality of museum collections and partially migratory habits meant that discrete subspecies could not be distinguished {{on the basis of the}} observed variation within the species.|$|E
5|$|Sea snakes are {{generally}} reluctant to bite, {{and are usually}} considered to be mild-tempered, although <b>variation</b> <b>is</b> seen among species and individuals. Some species, such as P. platurus, which feed by simply gulping down their prey, {{are more likely to}} bite when provoked because they seem to use their venom more for defense. Others, such as Laticauda, use their venom for prey immobilization; these snakes are often handled without concern by local fishermen, who unravel and toss them back into the water barehanded when the snakes become entangled in fishing nets. Species reported as much more aggressive include Aipysurus laevis, Astrotia stokesii, Enhydrina schistosa, Enhydrina zweifeli, and Hydrophis ornatus.|$|E
