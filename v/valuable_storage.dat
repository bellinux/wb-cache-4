50|$|Leopard geckos {{also have}} the ability to voluntarily detach their tails if it is attacked, grabbed by the tail, bitten during copulation, or nipped by another during feeding. This is called caudal {{autotomy}}. After autotomy the tail can continue to twitch for as long as 30 minutes, allowing the gecko to escape from its predator. The tail is large and at least in one related species (Christinus marmoratus) {{it has been reported that}} the tail-less fleeing gecko makes for a quicker getaway. Fractures in the tailbone allow the tail to separate easily and rapid vasoconstriction allows the gecko to suffer minimal blood loss. This detaching of the tail causes a high level of stress on the gecko due to the loss of the <b>valuable</b> <b>storage</b> of fat it once had. It will start to regenerate its tail immediately because it is needed for survival. A lost tail may increase the chance of sickness in the gecko and in some cases kill it, but this is very rare. Regenerated tails often retain similar colors to the original tail there will most likely be a wide variance from the vibrancy and patterns of the original, however, they are often smooth and lack the rigid qualities and length of a normal tail. The tail will also be shorter and often fatter than the previous tail.|$|E

40|$|Managing power {{generation}} from wind is conceptually straightforward: generate and sell as much electricity as possible when prices are positive, {{and do nothing}} otherwise. However, this strategy leads to curtailment when wind energy exceeds the transmission capacity or when prices are negative, and possible revenue dilution when current prices are low but are expected to increase in the future. Electricity storage provides a means to alleviate these problems, and also enables the purchase of electricity from the market for later resale. But the presence of storage and transmission capacity complicates the management of electricity generation from wind. Much is unknown about the management of such a generation plus storage and transmission system, for instance, how complex the optimal management of such a system is, how <b>valuable</b> <b>storage</b> is, and how relevant it is to include different factors—such as negative prices, the buying option, and future information.

40|$|The {{specific}} {{high energy}} and power capacities of rechargeable lithium metal (Li 0) batteries are {{ideally suited to}} portable devices and are <b>valuable</b> as <b>storage</b> units for intermittent renewable energy sources. Lithium, the lightest and most electropositive metal, would be the optimal anode material for rechargeable batteries {{if it were not}} for the fact that such devices fail unexpectedly by short-circuiting via the dendrites that grow across electrodes upon recharging. This phenomenon poses a major safety issue because it triggers a series of adverse events that start with overheating, potentially followed by the thermal decomposition and ultimately the ignition of the organic solvents used in such devices. In this thesis, we developed experimental platform for monitoring and quantifying the dendrite populations grown in a Li battery prototype upon charging under various conditions. We explored the effects of pulse charging in the kHz range and temperature on dendrite growth, and also on loss capacity into detached “dead” lithium particles. Simultaneously, we developed a computational framework for understanding the dynamics of dendrite propagation. The coarse-grained Monte Carlo model assisted us in the interpretation of pulsing experiments, whereas MD calculations provided insights into the mechanism of dendrites thermal relaxation. We also developed a computational framework for measuring the dead lithium crystals from the experimental images. ...|$|R
40|$|Thermostatically {{controlled}} electrical loads {{can provide}} <b>valuable</b> energy <b>storage</b> and are prime candidates for fast acting demand response (DR) {{that can be}} used to mitigate highly variable renewable power generation and limited availability of ramping resources. When conventional thermostats are retrofitted for real-time price DR control, significant control errors can arise, particularly in the form of dispatch control drift. This paper identifies the underlying causes and presents a new residential thermostat design that enables accurate aggregate load control. The new design gives rise to linear time-invariant models of aggregate load control and demand response, which facilitate the design of highly accurate load-based regulation services for electricity interconnections. Detailed simulation and performance studies coupling a residential house and feeder models are presented to show how consumer comfort and cost savings are achieved and how energy use is impacted for cities in three different climatic zones. During peak times, the new thermostat imparts the entire residential load an energy demand elasticity of about 10 % to 25 %. Larger demand elasticities could be achieved by extending the control strategy to other residential thermostatic loads. The proposed thermostat design can operate in the real-time distribution capacity auction system and can provide all the benefits associated with transactive systems, and in particular facilitate increased integration of renewable resources...|$|R

Although as of January 2000 GenBank contained over 220, 000 entries of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from plants, most publicly available plant ESTs are derived from vegetative tissues and relatively few ESTs are specifically derived from developing seeds.

40|$|The programmatic, {{facility}} and criticality safety support staffs at the LLNL Plutonium Facility {{worked together to}} successfully develop and implement a project to process legacy (DNFSB Recommendation 94 - 1 and non-Environmental, Safety, and Health (ES&H) labeled) materials in storage. Over many years, material had accumulated in storage that lacked information to adequately characterize the material for current criticality safety controls used in the facility. Generally, the fissionable material mass information was well known, but other information such as form, impurities, internal packaging, and presence of internal moderating or reflecting materials were not well documented. In many cases, the material was excess to programmatic need, but such a determination was difficult with the little information given on MC&A labels and in the MC&A database. The material was not packaged as efficiently as possible, so it also occupied much more <b>valuable</b> <b>storage</b> space than was necessary. Although safe as stored, the inadequately characterized material posed a risk for criticality safety noncompliances if moved within the facility under current criticality safety controls. A Legacy Item Implementation Plan was developed and implemented {{to deal with this}} problem. Reasonable bounding conditions were determined for the material involved, and criticality safety evaluations were completed. Two appropriately designated glove boxes were identified and criticality safety controls were developed to safely inspect the material. Inspecting the material involved identifying containers of legacy material, followed by opening, evaluating, processing if necessary, characterizing and repackaging the material. Material from multiple containers was consolidated more efficiently thus decreasing the total number of stored items to about one half of the highest count. Current packaging requirements were implemented. Detailed characterization of the material was captured in databases and new ES&H container labels applied. In many cases, legacy material that was inspected was determined to be excess to programmatic needs and it was then either processed to meet the DOE- 3013 -STD or designated as TRU waste and disposed of accordingly. During FY 2003 through FY 2004 approximately 1600 items were opened and the items processed if necessary, repackaged and newly labeled with ES&H labels. As of April, 2005, there are only 32 non-ES&H labeled items in existence within the Plutonium Facility. Due to a consolidated effort in dealing with the legacy items, the problems associated with storage of these items at LLNL has been substantially abated. The paper will discuss the background, implementation, and results of the SNM Legacy Items Implementation Project. Benefits and Lessons Learned will be identified...|$|E

In order to establish the role of the confinement size we have studied the microscopic dynamics of molecular hydrogen stored in the nanocages of clathrate hydrates of two different dimensions. We have found that by varying the size of the pore the diffusive mobility of confined hydrogen can be modified in both directions, i. e. reduced or enhanced compared to that in the bulk solid at the same temperatures. In the small cages with a mean crystallographic radius of 3. 95 the confinement reduces diffusive mobility by orders of magnitude. In contrast, in large cages with a mean radius of 4. 75 hydrogen molecules displays diffusive jump motion between different equilibrium sites inside the cages, visible at temperatures where bulk H 2 is solid.

30|$|The {{reduction}} {{or absence}} of the bristle type trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves and the glumes defines the glabrous phenotype in rice. This trait has been considered as selectively neutral, with neither a known selective advantage nor disadvantage. However, in areas where rice culture remains manual, the glabrous trait is fairly valued since the lack of trichomes reduces skin irritation and itching among workers during harvesting, threshing, drying and milling of rice ([Rutger and Mackill 2001]; Makenzie et al.[1987]). In the U.S., cultivation of glabrous varieties has been an important part of the rice industry. Initially valued for hand harvesting and threshing because they cause less itching, the glabrous varieties became more prized due to their higher bulk density compared with pubescent varieties ([Rutger and Mackill 2001]). The higher bulk density due to the close packing of the glabrous kernels saves <b>valuable</b> space during <b>storage</b> and transportation (Varnamkhasti et al.[2008];[Rutger and Mackill 2001]).

Among surface techniques allowing the observation of the entire storage complex, it has by far the greatest vertical and lateral resolution and it can provide a full 3 D view of the reservoir and overburden. However, in our experience, theoretical applicability of seismic acquisition for CO plume tracking has often been challenged by the geology: High rock stiffness, heterogeneity, large depths, or low porosity in a storage site are not favorable factors. Moreover, there is uncertainty on the minimum levels of detectability. CO might mix either homogeneously or create patches of variable saturation, and this {{can result in a}} large variability on the expected seismic signal, especially for saturations lower than 50 %. We investigate the seismic signal expected for a location in the Gippsland Basin, Victoria, Australia.

Log files have become a standard part of large applications and are essential in operating systems, computer networks and distributed systems. Log files are often the only way to identify and locate an error in software, because log file analysis is not affected by any time-based issues known as probe effect. This is opposite to analysis of a running program, when the analytical process can interfere with time-critical or resource critical conditions within the analyzed program. Log files are often very large and can have complex structure. Although the process of generating log files is quite simple and straightforward, log file analysis could be a tremendous task that requires enormous computational resources, long time and sophisticated procedures.

These unique properties make CNTs potentially <b>valuable</b> as hydrogen <b>storage,</b> superconductors, drug delivery and other end-use applications. Catalytic decomposition of methane is a promising method for producing hydrogen and CNTs simultaneously for several reasons: economic, high yield of products, {{and ease of}} control. Unfortunately, {{the presence of a}} metal catalyst in the CNTs product after reaction causes a negative impact on the quality of CNTs including reducing the electrical resistivity, density, tensile strength and structural properties of the nano tubes which can lead to the reduction of CNTs performance in many applications. Process optimization is needed to produce hydrogen and CNTs with the best quality by varying the reaction time to observe the influence of reaction time {{on the quality of the}} CNTs produced through the catalytic decomposition of methane. Production of CNTs was performed in a Gauze reactor at 700 °C, 1 atm with methane as a feed was about 315 ml/min.

The diameter of CNTs produced by a longer reaction time were greater, and it can be concluded that the longer the time reaction, the worse the quality of the CNTs produced.

In the teaching process, a variety of media information integrating text, graphics/images, audio and even video technologies can stimulate the learner’s interest in learning and improve the quality of teaching. In distance education, the greatest advantage of images is their figurativeness. Many of the contents of teaching will appear “dry” and boring if they are only expressed in words, and the expression will become very “rich and colorful” with images. In the so-called a picture wins thousands of words, image teaching is conducive to fully activate the classroom learning atmosphere and inject vitality into teaching [1]. In network distance education, due to various factors, remote network education will be limited by different specifications in the image transmission process, resulting in a large amount of noise in the image, which causes a large amount of noise in the image, causes the pixel features in the original educational resource image to change, makes the color of the distance education resource image visually error, and leads to distortion of the image setting. The above situation will make students’ attention divergence, less interest in learning, and lack of positive learning motivation [2]. If the image cannot be set reasonably and the image noise is reduced, the image information transmitted in the distance education will be inaccurate, and the image will lose the meaning of the demonstration, which will make the students unable to understand the deep meaning of the image information description and reduce the teaching effect and quality [3]. Only by filtering the noise signal in the image to ensure that the image <b>storage</b> <b>valuable</b> information is accurately displayed can it play an important role in network distance learning. Therefore, this study uses image processing technology to achieve distance education image correction.|$|R
40|$|Mega {{structures}} for CO 2 storage, {{such as the}} Utsira formation in the North Sea, could theoretically supply CO 2 storage capacity for several countries {{for a period of}} several decades. Their use could increase the cost-effectiveness of CCS in a region while minimizing opposition from the public to CO 2 storage. However, this will not only depend on their potential available capacity to store CO 2 flows but also on the cost effectiveness of such an option within national portfolios of mitigation measures. This article shows key results of a research project aiming to assess the potentials and costs of storing CO 2 in the Utsira formation for the time period 2015 – 2050. Countries included in the analysis are Denmark, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The starting point of the analysis are the national MARKAL and TIMES models developed for each country together with the 27 region Pan European TIMES model (PET). In the models scenarios, assumptions and parameters that are not country dependent (e. g. costs related with CO 2 capture technology development) have been harmonized. The results indicate that with stringent climate targets, CCS appears as a key mitigation option in the national portfolio of measures. Within the CCS portfolio, storage of CO 2 in the Utsira formation can indeed be a cost effective option for North Europe and it represents a <b>valuable</b> CO 2 <b>storage</b> option at the regional level. For instance, the United Kingdom will profit from the comparably short transport distance to Utsira while the Netherlands utilise the Utsira formation due to limited domestic low cost storage fields {{and the use of the}} country as a regional hub for CO 2. In Germany and Denmark, the competitiveness of CO 2 storage in Utsira is determined by the availability of domestic onshore saline aquifers. If these aquifers are not used, Utsira gains as competitive storage option. The main limitation for the common use of the Utsira formation appears, from a modeling point of view, to be the maximum annual injection rate for CO 2 that has been assumed in the project (150 Mt CO 2 /yr) ...|$|R
5000|$|Seagrass are a {{group of}} about 60 {{angiosperm}} species that have adapted to an aquatic life, and can grow in meadows along the shores of all continents except Antarctica. Seagrass meadows form in maximum depths of up to 50m, depending on water quality and light availability, and can include up to 12 different species in one meadow. These seagrass meadows are highly productive habitats that provide many ecosystem services, including sediment stabilization, habitat and biodiversity, better water quality, and carbon and nutrient sequestration. [...] The current documented seagrass area is 177,000 km2, but is thought to underestimate the total area since many areas with large seagrass meadows have not been thoroughly documented. Most common estimates are 300,000 to 600,000 km2, with up to 4,320,000 km2 suitable seagrass habitat worldwide. Although seagrass makes up only 0.1% of the area of the ocean floor, it accounts for approximately 10-18% of the total oceanic carbon burial. Currently global seagrass meadows are estimated to store as much as 19.9 Pg (gigaton, or billion tons) of organic carbon. Carbon primarily accumulates in marine sediments, which are anoxic and thus continually preserve organic carbon from decadal-millennial time scales. High accumulation rates, low oxygen, low sediment conductivity and slower microbial decomposition rates all encourage carbon burial and carbon accumulation in these coastal sediments. Compared to terrestrial habitats that lose carbon stocks as CO2 during decomposition or by disturbances like fires or deforestation, marine carbon sinks can retain C for much longer time periods. Carbon sequestration rates in seagrass meadows vary depending on the species, characteristics of the sediment, and depth of the habitats, but on average the carbon burial rate is approximately 138 g C m−2 yr−1. Seagrass habitats are threatened by coastal eutrophication, increased seawater temperatures, increased sedimentation and coastal development, and sea-level rise which may decrease light availability for photosynthesis. Seagrass loss has accelerated over the past few decades, from 0.9% per year prior to 1940 to 7% per year in 1990, with about 1/3 of global loss since WWII. Scientists encourage protection and continued research of these ecosystems for organic carbon <b>storage,</b> <b>valuable</b> habitat and other ecosystem services.|$|R
