40|$|The Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VKM) has, at {{the request}} of the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, {{assessed}} the risk of specified doses of L-arginine and arginine alpha-ketoglutarate in <b>food</b> <b>supplements.</b> VKM concludes that: • In adults (≥ 18 years), the specified doses of 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500 and 6000 mg/day of arginine in <b>food</b> <b>supplements</b> are considered unlikely to cause adverse health effects. The dose 6800 mg/day may represent a risk of adverse health effects. • In adolescents (14 to < 18 years), the specified doses 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500 mg/day L-arginine in <b>food</b> <b>supplements</b> are considered unlikely to cause adverse health effects, whereas the doses 6000 and 6800 mg/day may represent a risk of adverse health effects. • In children (10 to < 14 years), the specified doses 3000 and 3500 mg/day L-arginine in <b>food</b> <b>supplements</b> are considered unlikely to cause adverse health effects, whereas the doses 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500, 6000 and 6800 mg/day may represent a risk of adverse health effect.
