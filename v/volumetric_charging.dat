40|$|Traditional {{analysis}} of distribution grid user’s reaction to tariffs assumes {{a low price}} sensitivity {{and a lack of}} alternative technologies to grid connection. This is radically changing with two technology breakthroughs: (1) Photovoltaics (PV) enable domestic and commercial consumers to self-produce energy; (2) Batteries allow self-producers to set both their grid energy and capacity parameters. Contributing to the state of the art, the grid cost recovery problem is modelled as a non-cooperative game between consumers. In this game, the availability and costs of new technologies (such as PV and batteries) strategically interact with tariff structures. Four states of the world for user’s access to new technologies are distinguished and three tariff structures are evaluated. The assessed distribution network tariff structures are: energy <b>volumetric</b> <b>charges</b> with net-metering, energy <b>volumetric</b> <b>charges</b> for both injection and withdrawal, and capacity-based charges.

The framework of our analysis is founded in a unified electrical conductivity and self-potential petrophysical model. This model {{is based on}} an explicit dependence of these properties on porosity, water saturation, temperature, brine salinity, cementation and saturation (Archie) exponents and the <b>volumetric</b> <b>charge</b> density per unit pore volume associated with the clay fraction. This model is consistent with empirical laws widely used to interpret self-potential logs according to the two limiting cases corresponding to a clean sand and a pure shale. We present a finite element calculation of the self-potential signal produced by sand reservoirs interstratified with shale layers. For layered strata normal to the well, we demonstrate that the 3 -D Poisson equation governing the occurrence of self-potentials in a borehole can be simplified to a 2 -D axisymmetric partial differential equation solved at each depth providing a common self-potential reference can be defined between these different depths. This simplification is very accurate as long as the vertical salinity gradients are not too strong over distances corresponding to the borehole diameter. The inversion of borehole data (self-potential, resistivity and density well logs, incorporating information derived from neutron porosity and gamma-ray log data) is performed with the Adaptive Metropolis Algorithm (AMA). We start by formulating an approximate analytical solution for the six model parameters (water saturation, porosity, the two Archie's exponents, the pore water conductivity and the <b>volumetric</b> <b>charge</b> density of the diffuse layer). This solution is used for the AMA algorithm to converge in less than 60 iterations at each depth for the real case study.

However, the atomic structures of the nano objects are typically not available or they are solid state entities. Because of that, the researchers have to investigate such nano systems by generating models of the nano objects {{in a manner that}} the existing software be able to carry the simulations. In addition, it should allow generating composite objects with complex shape by combining basic geometrical figures and embedding biological macromolecules within the system. Results Here we report the Protein Nano-Object Integrator (ProNOI) which allows for generating atomic-style geometrical objects with user desired shape and dimensions. Unlimited number of objects can be created and combined with biological macromolecules in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format file. Once the objects are generated, the users can use sliders to manipulate their shape, dimension and absolute position. In addition, the software offers the option to charge the objects with either specified surface or <b>volumetric</b> <b>charge</b> density and to model them with user-desired dielectric constants. According to the user preference, the biological macromolecule atoms can be assigned charges and radii according to four different force fields: Amber, Charmm, OPLS and PARSE. The biological macromolecules and the atomic-style objects are exported as a position, charge and radius (PQR) file, or if a default dielectric constant distribution is not selected, it is exported as a position, charge, radius and epsilon (PQRE) file. As illustration of the capabilities of the ProNOI, we created a composite object in a shape of a robot, aptly named the Clemson Robot, whose parts are <b>charged</b> with various <b>volumetric</b> <b>charge</b> densities and holds the barnase-barstar protein complex in its hand.

40|$|Water utility {{pricing and}} {{investment}} planning involves decisions on (1) {{when and how}} much to invest in additional capacity, and (2) the determination of fixed <b>charges,</b> <b>volumetric</b> <b>charges,</b> and connection fees for several classes of customers with different patterns of use and demand characteristics. These decisions have to be reached under certain political, financial, and administrative constraints. Given the complexity of the issue, the traditional approach for water utility management has relied on financial rather than economic criteria, with little attention being given to the complementary nature of the services provided by water and wastewater utilities. Conventional practices, therefore, produces inefficiency and less than optimal proportionality in capacity design between the water supply and wastewater treatment systems. Recognizing the drawbacks of conventional practices and the limitations of earlier studies, a theoretical framework for optimum rate design and capacity expansion for a combined water supply-wastewater treatment system has been produced in this research. Several variations of the model have been presented to deal with the specific problems of: (a) administrative and social constraints; (b) financial recovery; (c) the determination of connection fees; and (d) <b>volumetric</b> <b>charges</b> for different classes of customers. In general, practical alternatives to the traditional approach can be classified into (i) marginal cost pricing schemes; and (ii) constant price-capacity expansion strategies. The short-run marginal cost includes the marginal supply cost, marginal treatment cost, and the marginal environmental damage cost; the constant real price is a weighted average of that present value of short-run marginal costs and the marginal annual benefits of additional capacity in both systems. While marginal cost pricing-capacity expansion policy tends to maximize the present value of the social net benefits associated with water utility services, it is not a feasible alternative to conventional practices. The resulting variation in prices overtime is neither administratively feasible nor politically acceptable. The constant (real) price and capacity expansion strategy, on the other hand, seems to overcome most of the deficiencies with the traditional approach, and the shortcomings of marginal cost pricing policy. Finally, a practical procedure for the implementation of constant (real) pricing-capacity expansion strategy has been suggested in this study. N/A 350 p...|$|R

The former is easier to implement but does not stimulate water-saving technical change. A 15 % cut in agricultural water supplies (permitting a 79 % increase in non-agricultural use) raise farmer incomes and has moderate negative effects on consumer welfare and production; a 30 % cut causes disproportionately larger negative effects, including large increases in the agricultural trade deficit. Efficient market-based allocations yield higher production and avoid unequal water access, associated with the inefficient alternative of forcing half the farmers to cut their use. However, water sales to farmers at prices reducing demand by 15 - 30 % lead to 20 - 35 % declines in farmer incomes.

In Germany abstraction fees exist only for groundwater and only in some states, and their proceeds go into the general state budget. Mexico also charges for water abstraction and returns proceeds to utilities, but not to industries. Outside the OECD countries few countries charge water abstraction fees. Where they are applied the level of fees tends to be nominal, such as in Morocco, or enforcement is partial, such as for groundwater abstraction fees in Jordan. In almost all countries that have introduced abstraction fees agriculture, the major water user worldwide, is exempted from abstraction fees.

The aquifers of the Lower Jordan River Basin, a region of prime importance for the country, are exploited well beyond their sustainable rate. In 1997, Jordan's officials designed a new water strategy, with emphasis on demand-management instruments. Water pricing policies, and notably the bylaw no. 85 of 2002, were deemed to assist in controlling agricultural groundwater abstraction with the ambitious task of taking the abstraction rate close to the annual recharge. While much hope has been placed in such strategies, this paper argues that substantial increases in <b>volumetric</b> <b>charges</b> would not result in major water savings but would further decrease the income from low-value or extensive crops. A shift towards highvalue crops would raise water productivity but would also entail a transfer of wealth to the government and to wealthier entrepreneurs. It is therefore essential that negative incentives be accompanied by positive measures offering attractive alternatives (market opportunities, subsidies for modernization, technical advice, etc.) and exit options with compensation.

40|$|Surface layers for {{crystals}} of triglycinesulphate, deutered triglycinesulphate, tin tiohypodiphosphate, lead germanate, antimony chalkohenide material {{are considered}} in the paper aiming at the complex investigation of pyroelectrical and emission properties of surface layers for crystals of TGS group. The comparative investigation of the given properties of TGS group crystals, which are dielectrics with properties of ferroelectrics-semiconductors Sn* 002 P* 002 S* 006, Pb* 005 Ge* 003 O* 001 * 001 KHGS- 2 is also {{the aim of the}} paper. Pyroelectrical characteristics of surface layers have been investigated. The role of a surface layer in the process of the screening for the spontaneous polarity has been established. A layer with the inverse polarity in TGS crystals has been detected in the field of the phase transition. The influence of semiconducting properties on the character of the P* 00 c distribution has been detected. The influence of semiconducting properties of ferroelectrics has been developed. The methodology represented makes it possible to determine the presence of layers of a <b>volumetric</b> <b>charge</b> in a crystal and layers, the polarity of which differs from the polarity of the main volume of a crystal. The methodology makes it possible to estimate the thickness of these layers. The paper results may find their field of application in pyroreceivers, targets of pyrovideoconesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|The charge {{transport}} in zinc-oxide piezosemiconductive nanowires under purely vertical compressive or tensile strains is investigated. For simplicity, {{only the}} additional band bending originated by the piezoelectric charges has been accounted for. Moreover, a constant <b>volumetric</b> piezoelectric <b>charge</b> density is assumed, distributed within a maximum distance δ piezo {{from the two}} junctions between the metal ends and the nanowire. Examples demonstrate that the carrier concentration, the energy conduction band proﬁle, and the current–voltage characteristics signiﬁcantly depend on δ piezo. Therefore, we propose the use of currentvoltage measurements to obtain information on δ piezo in strained piezosemiconductors...|$|R
