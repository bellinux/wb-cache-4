5|$|Modern western vegetarianism {{was founded}} in the United Kingdom in 1847 with the world's first Vegetarian Society. It has {{increased}} markedly {{since the end of}} World War II, when there were around 100,000 vegetarians in the country. By 2003 there were between 3 and 4 million vegetarians in the UK, one of the highest percentages in the Western world, while around 7 million people claim to eat no red meat. By 2015, 11 of 22 restaurant chains studied by the <b>Vegan</b> Society had at least one <b>vegan</b> main course on their menu, though only 6 of these explicitly labelled them as <b>vegan</b> dishes. Top-end vegetarian restaurants remain relatively few, though they are increasing rapidly: there were some 20 in Britain in 2007, rising to 30 in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Gardein (a {{portmanteau}} {{of garden}} and protein) {{is a product}} line of meat-free foods made by Garden Protein International in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada. In November 2014, Pinnacle Foods purchased Gardein for $154 million. Founder Yves Potvin stayed on with the company, and has stated that the buy-out assisted Gardein to access more capital and expand manufacturing facilities to Hagerstown. All Gardein products are <b>vegan,</b> and they are certified by <b>Vegan</b> Action. Most of Gardein's products are certified Kosher pareve by Kosher Check (The Orthodox Rabbinical Council of BC). In 2014, they added gluten-free beefless products to their range {{in response to the}} expanding gluten allergy market.|$|E
5|$|Gardein {{received}} several awards in 2014, including PETA's Product of the Year, the Libby Award for PETA's 'Best Seasonal <b>Vegan</b> Food,' the 'Foodie Award' by the Vegetarian Times, and the National Restaurant Association's Food and Beverage Innovations (FABI) Awards for their Fishless Fillets.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 2009, Mills {{opened a}} <b>vegan</b> {{restaurant}} called VBites at Hove Lagoon, Hove, Sussex. Mills {{is quoted as}} saying that she intends it to be the first in a worldwide chain of <b>vegan</b> restaurants. Whilst promoting the restaurant, Mills gave an interview to the BBC, stating that she'd been very proactive in the building stages and now that it was open, would give as much time to it as she could – working it around her charity work. In May 2013 she sold the restaurant premises to local record producer Fatboy Slim and opened a new, enlarged VBites in East Street in Brighton.|$|E
5|$|Tabbouleh is a Levantine <b>vegan</b> dish (sometimes {{considered}} a salad) traditionally made of tomatoes, finely chopped parsley, mint, bulgur and onion, and seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, and salt. Some Israeli {{variations of the}} salad use pomegranate seeds instead of tomatoes.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{ingredients}} used {{can include}} yogurt, buttermilk, raisins, dates, walnuts, hazelnuts, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg among others. Lemon juice {{may be used}} on the avocado to prevent browning from occurring. Avocado cake can be prepared as a vegetarian and <b>vegan</b> dish. Chocolate cake and pancakes can be prepared with avocado as an ingredient in the batter.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} from his hip surgery, Costello returned to active competition at age 56. The {{fact that he}} was able to recover from such a major injury is credited to his almost-fanatical style of healthy living. As a devout <b>vegan,</b> Costello credited his meat-free diet with his recovery, as well as the remarkable shape he was in for a man of his age.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{became a}} {{successful}} dry-goods merchant, traveling regularly to Alexandria, Damascus, and Beirut to buy flour and other basic foodstuffs {{to sell in}} Jerusalem. In 1927 one of Angel's customers, the Trachtenberg Bakery in Bayit <b>VeGan,</b> went bankrupt. Angel decided {{to pay off the}} bakery's debts and assume ownership, bringing in his father Avraham and three brothers as partners. A few years later, two of his brothers, Leon and Refael, left to open their own bakery in Haifa.|$|E

Carrot soup can be prepared as a <b>vegan</b> food, and can also be prepared as a bisque.|$|E
5|$|When the {{hospital}} {{moved to new}} and more modern headquarters in the Bayit <b>Vegan</b> neighborhood in 1980, Schwester Selma moved along with it.

5|$|Animal-sourced foods (meat, fish, shellfish, fowl, eggs, dairy) provide zinc. The {{concentration}} of zinc in plants {{varies with the}} level in the soil. With adequate zinc in the soil, the food plants that contain the most zinc are wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds (sesame, poppy, alfalfa, celery, mustard). Zinc {{is also found in}} beans, nuts, almonds, whole grains, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and blackcurrant. Plant phytates interfere with zinc absorption, so people consuming a vegetarian or <b>vegan</b> diet may need to increase zinc intake.|$|E
5|$|At certain dates, food may be set {{out as a}} {{sacrifice}} to {{the spirits of the}} deceased or the gods, such as during the Qingming Festival. This may include slaughtered animals, such as pigs and ducks, or fruit. Another form of sacrifice involves the burning of Joss paper, or Hell Bank Notes, on the assumption that images thus consumed by the fire will reappear—not as a mere image, but as the actual item—in the spirit world, making them available for revered ancestors and departed loved ones. At other points, a <b>vegan</b> diet or full fast may be observed.|$|E
5|$|Later {{residents}} of the area have included the classical scholar, essayist, poet {{and founder of the}} Society for Psychical Research, Frederic Myers, who was born in Keswick, and the campaigner for animal welfare Donald Watson, founder of the <b>Vegan</b> Society, who lived in Keswick after retiring from teaching. The pioneer mountaineers and photographers George and Ashley Abraham lived and worked in Keswick. Their photographic shop in Lake Road, built in 1887, was later taken over by the local mountaineer and outfitter George Fisher; the shop still contains memorabilia, including photographs, from the Abrahams' era.|$|E
5|$|Letting bean dip {{sit for a}} {{while before}} serving can {{increase}} the intermingling of flavors in the dish. Bean dip can be served cold, at room temperature, or as a hot dish. Hot bean dip can be prepared ahead of time, refrigerated and then cooked at a later time, and can also be prepared using a slow cooker and served in the appliance. Bean dip can be prepared as a <b>vegan</b> and gluten-free dish. The dish is typically served with tortilla chips, and can also be served with crackers, crudités, breadsticks, pita bread and toasted bread such as baguette.|$|E
5|$|Nutrition {{facts are}} {{posted on the}} company's website. As with most pasta-based dishes, the company's noodles dishes are high in carbohydrates, with regular-sized dishes {{containing}} 80–150 grams of carbohydrates per serving (the company's salads and sandwiches tend to be lower in carbohydrates). Many of the regular-sized pasta dishes exceed 1,000 calories, but smaller portions with under 500 calories are available for some dishes. Noodles and Company offers dishes made with gluten-free and <b>vegan</b> ingredients, but warns that cross-contamination may occur.|$|E
5|$|A cat's {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{is adapted to}} meat eating, being much shorter than that of omnivores and having low levels {{of several of the}} digestive enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates. These traits severely limit the cat's ability to digest and use plant-derived nutrients, as well as certain fatty acids. Despite the cat's meat-oriented physiology, several vegetarian or <b>vegan</b> cat foods have been marketed that are supplemented with chemically synthesized taurine and other nutrients, in attempts to produce a complete diet. However, some of these products still fail to provide all the nutrients cats require, and diets containing no animal products pose the risk of causing severe nutritional deficiencies. However, veterinarians in the United States have expressed concern that many domestic cats are overfed.|$|E
5|$|Mills booked {{herself into}} the Hippocrates Health Institute in Florida, which put her on a raw food <b>vegan</b> diet, using wheat grass and garlic poultices to heal her wound. After an operation, Mills {{discovered}} {{that she had been}} previously identified as having an O rhesus negative blood type, when in fact she was A rhesus negative, which had interfered with her attempts to follow the so-called blood type diet. As her prosthetic leg had to be replaced on a regular basis, because the size of the amputated stump kept changing as it healed, she had the idea to collect thousands of discarded prosthetic limbs for amputees in Croatia. Mills persuaded the Brixton prison governor to get inmates to dismantle and pack the prosthetic limbs before being transported, which resulted in 22,000 amputees obtaining limbs in addition to the Croatian citizens who were already supplied with prosthetic limbs by the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance, which paid for the fitting of limbs and rehabilitation of patients. The first convoy of limbs arrived in Zagreb in October 1994 and Mills travelled with the convoy to film interviews with some of the recipients for the Good Morning with Anne and Nick daytime TV show. She received an award in 2001 from Croatia's prime minister, Ivica Račan for the money she raised to help clear that country of landmines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vegan</b> groups {{disagree}} about insect products. Neither the <b>Vegan</b> Society nor the American <b>Vegan</b> Society considers honey, silk, and other insect products as suitable for vegans, while <b>Vegan</b> Action and <b>Vegan</b> Outreach {{view it as}} a matter of personal choice. Agave nectar is a popular <b>vegan</b> alternative to honey.|$|E
25|$|Multiple symbols {{have been}} {{developed}} to represent veganism. Several are used on consumer packaging, including the <b>Vegan</b> Society trademark and <b>Vegan</b> Action logo, to indicate products without animal-derived ingredients. Various symbols may also be used by members of the <b>vegan</b> community to represent their identity {{and in the course of}} animal rights activism, for example a <b>vegan</b> flag.|$|E

25|$|Butter can be {{replaced}} with a <b>vegan</b> alternative such as Earth Balance's. <b>Vegan</b> (egg-free) mayonnaise brands include Vegenaise, Nayonaise, Mindful Mayo, and Plamil's Egg-Free Mayo. <b>Vegan</b> cheeses, such as Chreese and Daiya, are made from soy, nuts and tapioca, and can replace the meltability of dairy cheese. Nutritional yeast is a common substitute for the taste of cheese in <b>vegan</b> recipes. Cheese substitutes can be made at home.|$|E
25|$|According to a Care2 report, vegans in the IDF may refuse {{vaccination}} if {{they oppose}} animal testing. They are given artificial leather {{boots and a}} black fleece beret. Until 2014, <b>vegan</b> soldiers in the IDF received special allowances to buy their own food, when this policy was replaced with <b>vegan</b> food being provided in all bases, as well as <b>vegan</b> combat rations being offered to <b>vegan</b> combat soldiers.|$|E
