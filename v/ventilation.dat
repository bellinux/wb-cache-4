5|$|Airway {{management}} can {{be classified}} into closed or open techniques depending on the system of <b>ventilation</b> used. Tracheal intubation is a typical example of a closed technique as <b>ventilation</b> occurs using a closed circuit. Several open techniques exist, such as spontaneous <b>ventilation,</b> apnoeic <b>ventilation</b> or jet <b>ventilation.</b> Each has its own specific advantages and disadvantages which determine when it should be used.|$|E
5|$|Medical procedures, {{such as the}} {{insertion}} of a central venous catheter {{into one of the}} chest veins or the taking of biopsy samples from lung tissue, may lead to pneumothorax. The administration of positive pressure <b>ventilation,</b> either mechanical <b>ventilation</b> or non-invasive <b>ventilation,</b> can result in barotrauma (pressure-related injury) leading to a pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, heating, <b>ventilation</b> and air {{conditioning}} (HVAC) systems account for 30% (4.65EJ/yr) of the energy used in commercial buildings and nearly 50% (10.1EJ/yr) of the energy used in residential buildings. Solar heating, cooling and <b>ventilation</b> technologies {{can be used to}} offset a portion of this energy.|$|E

50|$|The {{remainder}} of the criteria {{are the same as}} those specified in the adult acronym, except that an apneic child is given five assisted <b>ventilations</b> before being triaged Black. A child who starts breathing on their own after five <b>ventilations</b> is triaged RED; a child without spontaneous return of respirations is triaged BLACK.|$|R
5|$|People with TBI are {{provided}} with supplemental oxygen and may need mechanical <b>ventilation.</b> Employment of certain measures such as Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and <b>ventilation</b> at higher-than-normal pressures may be helpful in maintaining adequate oxygenation. However, such measures can also increase leakage of air through a tear, and can stress the sutures in a tear that has been surgically repaired; therefore the lowest possible airway pressures that still maintain oxygenation are typically used. Mechanical <b>ventilation</b> can also cause pulmonary barotrauma when high pressure is required to ventilate the lungs. Techniques such as pulmonary toilet (removal of secretions), fluid management, and treatment of pneumonia are employed to improve pulmonary compliance (the elasticity of the lungs).|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} two {{entrance}}s and exits. The main station entrance and <b>ventilation</b> building {{consists of four}} escalators and an elevator {{on the west side}} of Hudson Boulevard between 33rd and 34th Streets. The main entrance has a turtle shell-shaped glass canopy above it that allows light to shine on the upper mezzanine. The elevator is located south of 34th Street in Hudson Park, while the escalator entrance is located further east, closer to the boulevard. At the time of construction, the <b>ventilation</b> building was designed so developers could built on top of it later. The 55 Hudson Yards skyscraper, whose structure is partially atop the <b>ventilation</b> tower, started construction in January 2015, and pictures in May 2016 showed that the skyscraper had so far been constructed to the height of the <b>ventilation</b> tower.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal intubation, usually simply {{referred}} to as intubation, is the placement of a flexible plastic tube into the trachea (windpipe) to maintain an open airway or {{to serve as a}} conduit through which to administer certain drugs. It is frequently performed in critically injured, ill, or anesthetized patients to facilitate <b>ventilation</b> of the lungs, including mechanical <b>ventilation,</b> and to prevent the possibility of asphyxiation or airway obstruction.|$|E
5000|$|If the <b>ventilations</b> are successful, assess for the {{presence}} of a pulse at the carotid artery. If a pulse is detected, then the patient should continue to receive artificial <b>ventilations</b> at an appropriate rate and transported immediately. Otherwise, begin CPR at a ratio of 30:2 compressions to ventilation's at 100 compressions/minute for 5 cycles.|$|R

5|$|A cube-shaped {{concrete}} {{building was}} constructed {{on the top}} of the hill, next to the dome. This was intended to be used as the bomb-proof outlet for a <b>ventilation</b> and air conditioning shaft. It was an essential component of a facility where dangerous and explosive gases were expected to be used in large quantities on a daily basis. It was never finished, and the Allies found when they captured the site that the <b>ventilation</b> shaft had not been fully excavated. The building survived the bombing intact and is still prominently visible today.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in the}} project, it was {{announced}} that the new stations would feature platform screen doors. The stations (along with the new South Ferry station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and the three Phase 1 Second Avenue Subway stations in the Upper East Side) would include special air-cooling systems to reduce the temperature along platforms. Due to its depth, the extension has <b>ventilation</b> towers, rather than the <b>ventilation</b> grates ubiquitous {{in the rest of the}} subway system.|$|E
5|$|Low oxygen levels and, eventually, {{high carbon}} dioxide {{levels in the}} blood can occur from poor gas {{exchange}} due to decreased <b>ventilation</b> from airway obstruction, hyperinflation and a reduced desire to breathe. During exacerbations, airway inflammation is also increased, resulting in increased hyperinflation, reduced expiratory airflow and worsening of gas transfer. This {{can also lead to}} insufficient <b>ventilation</b> and, eventually, low blood oxygen levels. Low oxygen levels, if present for a prolonged period, can result in narrowing of the arteries in the lungs, while emphysema leads to breakdown of capillaries in the lungs. Both these changes result in increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which may cause cor pulmonale.|$|E

40|$|Less than 1 in 10 {{victims of}} out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) survive. 1 Bystander {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR) doubles {{the chances of}} survival, 2 yet is only undertaken in one-third of cases. 3 Chest compression-only CPR (CCCPR) has emerged {{as an alternative to}} standard CPR, which includes compressions and <b>ventilations.</b> This method is easier to learn and retain and eliminates the necessity for mouth-to-mouth contact (which may be an impediment to a bystander starting CPR). Furthermore, it reduces potentially harmful interruptions in chest compressions caused during <b>ventilations...</b>|$|R

5|$|New {{environmental}} technologies in heating, lighting, <b>ventilation</b> and sanitation were also critical to creating taller buildings that were attractive to work in. Central heating {{could not be}} easily extended to serve larger buildings; in the 1850s, a system using low-pressure steam and steam-operated fans became adopted {{in the construction of}} the later skyscrapers. Many U.S. buildings were lit by gas, but this carried safety risks and was difficult to install in taller buildings. As an alternative, electric lights were installed from 1878 onwards, powered by basement generators. <b>Ventilation</b> was also a challenge, as smoke drifting into offices from the streets and the fumes from the gas lighting made air quality a major health issue. A steam-driven, forced-draft <b>ventilation</b> system was invented in 1860 and became widely used in taller buildings by the 1870s, overcoming much of the problem. Improvements in iron piping permitted running hot and cold water and sanitation facilities to be installed throughout taller buildings for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Preterm newborns {{are known}} to be at higher risk for bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} with extended exposure to high concentrations of oxygen. Other groups at higher risk for oxygen toxicity are patients on mechanical <b>ventilation</b> with exposure to levels of oxygen greater than 50%, and patients exposed to chemicals that increase risk for oxygen toxicity such the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin. Therefore, current guidelines for patients on mechanical <b>ventilation</b> in intensive care recommends keeping oxygen concentration less than 60%. Likewise, divers who undergo treatment of decompression sickness are at increased risk of oxygen toxicity as treatment entails exposure to long periods of oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions, in addition to any oxygen exposure during the dive.|$|E

5|$|Spontaneous <b>ventilation</b> {{has been}} {{traditionally}} performed with an inhalational agent (i.e. gas induction or inhalational induction using halothane or sevoflurane) however {{it can also}} be performed using intravenous anaesthesia (e.g. propofol, ketamine or dexmedetomidine). SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and High-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) is an open airway technique that uses an upwards titration of propofol which maintains <b>ventilation</b> at deep levels of anaesthesia. It has been used in airway surgery as an alternative to tracheal intubation.|$|E
5|$|The current bellmouth, built {{along with}} the Queens Boulevard connection, is two levels deep with two {{additional}} stub-end subway tracks named T1A and T2A. It is viable for future construction of the bypass or the Northern Boulevard transfer station. The original bellmouth stopped at 29th Street. The lower level of the bellmouth was excavated in 2003 for the LIRR East Side Access project, which also extended the subway stub tracks farther east towards Sunnyside Yard. Just above the connection sits the 29th Street <b>Ventilation</b> Complex, built with the connector, in {{the site of a}} former parking lot. West of the station, a second <b>ventilation</b> complex lies in Queensbridge Park between Vernon Boulevard and the East River.|$|E
40|$|Background - Cardiopulmonary {{resuscitation}} {{is a life}} {{skill that}} requires proper psychomotor skill development. It is a key component in the Concept of the "Chain of Survival. Training in CPR has been advocated since 1974 with subsequent courses and training programs. Like many programs, the curricula tend to be instructor centered, few, {{if any of the}} curricula have addressed the issue of learning styles. There is a significant amount of literature describing the lack of success in the acquisition and retention of skills. Several investigations have demonstrated that this system may improve CPR delivery and skill retention. Individuals vary in their ability to perceive, organize, store, process, understand, and use information. These differences are known as cognitive styles. Methods - This project used an experimental design with an aptitude (learning style) treatment (feedback) interaction design. In this study two factors used in the analysis of variance. Subjects were administered the Group Embedded Figures Test to determine their level of field dependence. Groups were then randomized to receive feedback on skill performance. Following initial instruction subjects were asked to complete a three- minute bout of CPR each week for four weeks, using their assigned method of feedback. At the conclusion of the fourth week, subjects were tested without feedback. Performance measures were rate of compressions, mean depth of compressions, percentage of correct compressions, and percentage of correct <b>ventilations.</b> Results - No significant interaction was found between learning style and method of feedback for any of the variables. No main effect was noted for any of the variables and learning style. A main effect was noted for method of feedback relative to the percentage of correct compressions and the percentage of correct <b>ventilations.</b> Both the computer auditory and computer visual groups achieved a greater percentage of correct compressions than instructor driven feedback. For the percentage of correct <b>ventilations,</b> computer auditory feedback resulted in a high percentage of correct <b>ventilations</b> compared to instructor driven feedback. Conclusions - Computer feedback has been demonstrated to enhance student performance, irrespective of learning style. Enhanced performance has a clinical significance...|$|R
30|$|The {{fact that}} {{hygroscopic}} materials can moderate indoor humidity {{is important because}} it shows that the moisture produced in a space is not directly transferred to the ventilated air as assumed in current <b>ventilations</b> design methods. Since heat and moisture transfer are coupled, the indoor temperature will increase when moisture accumulates in the hygroscopic structure and decrease when moisture evaporates from the structure.|$|R
40|$|Background: In September 2015, Japan {{experienced}} an unusual increase in acute asthma hospitalizations of children that coincided with an enterovirus D 68 (EV-D 68) epidemic. The {{objective of this}} study is to investigate whether EV-D 68 had a causal relationship with the spike in asthma hospitalizations. Methods: A nation-wide retrospective survey of asthma hospitalizations of children was performed for the period from January 2010 through October 2015. The Japanese Society of Pediatric Allergy and Clinical Immunology asked its affiliated hospitals to report monthly numbers of hospitalizations, ICU admissions and mechanical <b>ventilations</b> due to acute asthma exacerbation. The data were retrieved from medical databases using predefined search criteria: diagnosis of asthma or asthmatic bronchitis, admission, and age < 20 years. Monthly numbers of EV-D 68 detection were also obtained from the Infectious Disease Surveillance Center of Japan. A Granger causality test was used to analyze the association of EV-D 68 detections for asthma exacerbation. Results: A total of 157 hospitals reported 87, 189 asthma hospitalizations, including 477 ICU admissions and 1193 mechanical <b>ventilations,</b> during the survey period of 5 years and 10 months. The numbers of these events increased drastically in September 2015. The Granger causality test verified the association between EV-D 68 and asthma hospitalizations/mechanical <b>ventilations.</b> The most-affected age group was 3 – 6 years old. Conclusions: The spike in pediatric asthma hospitalizations in Japan in September 2015 was found to be associated with the EV-D 68 epidemic. Respiratory pathogens can cause “epidemics” of asthma exacerbation. Coordinated surveillance of infectious diseases and asthma may be beneficial for prevention and better control of both illnesses...|$|R
5|$|Traumatic {{pneumothorax}} {{most commonly}} {{occurs when the}} chest wall is pierced, such as when a stab wound or gunshot wound allows air to enter the pleural space, or because some other mechanical injury to the lung compromises {{the integrity of the}} involved structures. Traumatic pneumothoraces have been found to occur in up to half of all cases of chest trauma, with only rib fractures being more common in this group. The pneumothorax can be occult (not readily apparent) in half of these cases, but may enlarge - particularly if mechanical <b>ventilation</b> is required. They are also encountered in patients already receiving mechanical <b>ventilation</b> for some other reason.|$|E

50|$|As of December 2005, Advanced Cardiac Life Support {{guidelines}} {{have changed}} significantly. A major new worldwide consensus {{has been sought}} based upon the best available scientific evidence. The ratio of compressions to <b>ventilations</b> is now recommended as 30:2 for adults, to produce higher coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures. Defibrillation is now administered as a single shock, each followed immediately by two minutes of CPR before rhythm is re-assessed (five cycles of CPR).|$|R
40|$|The {{ventilatory}} {{response to}} isocapnic hypoxia is biphasic, which makes any experimental {{assessment of the}} relationship between the acute (peak) ventilatory response and the level of hypoxia difficult. This study explored whether one particular protocol could be useful for determining this relationship. The protocol consisted of exposing subjects to seven different levels of isocapnic hypoxia, each of which lasted 50 sec. In order to test whether the order of the hypoxic exposure had any effect on the outcome, the steps were performed both in increasing and decreasing severity of hypoxia, and the ventilatory responses compared. Twelve subjects were studied, and each test was repeated four times in each subject. PETCO 2 was held at 2 mmHg above resting throughout. The <b>ventilations</b> obtained at the lowest level of PETO 2 employed were clearly different between the two protocols. However, provided that these <b>ventilations</b> were excluded, no significant differences were present between the results from the ascending and descending exposures (ANOVA). This finding suggests that the rate of change of PO 2 in these protocols was sufficiently slow for a full ventilatory response to develop, but also sufficiently fast to prevent significant ventilatory depression from occurring...|$|R
5000|$|... "Classic" [...] RSI {{involves}} pre-filling the patient's lungs with a {{high concentration}} of oxygen gas, followed by applying cricoid pressure, administering rapid-onset sedative or hypnotic and neuromuscular-blocking drugs that induce prompt unconsciousness and paralysis, inserting an endotracheal tube with minimal delay, and then releasing the cricoid pressure. [...] "Modified" [...] RSI refers to changes that deviates from the classic pattern, usually to reduce acidosis or improve oxygenation, but at the expense of increased regurgitation risk; examples of modifications include giving <b>ventilations</b> before the tube has been placed, or not using cricoid pressure.|$|R
