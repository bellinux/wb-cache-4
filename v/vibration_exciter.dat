However practical vibration given by the <b>vibration</b> <b>exciter</b> includes parasitic motion such as transverse, rocking, and bending motion. The parasitic motion especially gives two serious effects on primary calibration results, transverse sensitivity effect and vibration distribution effect. Transverse sensitivity effect is caused by an inner product of the vectors of both transverse motion and transverse sensitivity. On the other hand, the vibration distribution effect is caused by motion disturbance and relative difference between acceleration at sensing point of accelerometer and at the spot sensed by the interferometer. These uncertainty sources have close interaction between <b>vibration</b> <b>exciter</b> and accelerometer, and close interaction between <b>vibration</b> <b>exciter</b> and the laser interferometer, respectively.

The vibrations of the buildings were induced by means of synchronized <b>vibration</b> <b>exciters.</b> The mathematical analysis {{needed in order to}} determine the stiffness and damping matrices from the experimentally determined modal properties of a structure has been developed. Three translational and one torsional mode of vibration of the reinforced concrete building were investigated in considerable detail. The damping in each mode and the resonant frequency was determined under various levels of excitation. Complete mode shapes were determined as well. The measurements of the resonant frequencies show a well-defined nonlinearity that can be well explained from the hysteretic material properties. The values of damping were for all modes approximately 2 % with a tendency for the value of damping to increase with increasing force levels. A total of seven translational and three torsional modes of vibration of the nine-story steel frame building were investigated in detail. A mode in which the floor slabs vibrate horizontally as free-free beams was excited as well. The lowest translational modes in the two principal directions of the building had damping values of about 0. 5 %. The second lowest translational modes had damping values of approximately 1. 0 %. For both buildings the damping values are considerably less than the values usually mentioned in the literature. Since most earlier tests used run-down tests rather than the steady-state tests used in the present work, comparison tests were run to explore possible differences in the test results. It was concluded that run-down tests could easily overestimate the values of damping by several hundred per cent.

The new method has several important advantages over wind-excited vibration tests which have been used extensively in the past to measure the natural periods of vibration of structures...|$|R

Names as ESPI or Electronic speckle pattern interferometry, Electro-optic holography and Electronic holography {{are commonly used}} for this real-time video based interferometric technique. Shearography has become an important tool in non destructive testing. It is a TV holography technique that measures spatial derivatives of deformations. The introduction chapter of this thesis includes examples of applications and gives {{a brief description of}} the techniques. The following chapters contain scientific papers which describe the further development and new applications of TV holography and shearography. First, a new algorithm called temporal phase unwrapping is described for use in step loaded interferornetric measurements. Spatial unwrapping that can cause problem is avoided. Main advantages are; it is inherent simple, errors are constrained within the high-noise regions and real discontinuities are automatically unwrapped correctly. The algorithm has been applied to shape measurements using projected fringes and phase stepping. This technique easily measures the shape of three dimensional discontinuous objects. Then, a technique is developed aimed to simplify pulsed laser holographic experiments. It is a TV holographic technique that allows quantitative measurements from only two recorded single exposure frames. It can be applied to sequences of recorded frames for time resolved experiments. Furthermore, the alignment of the set-up is simple compared to other similar techniques. Thirdly, a new optical design is presented which makes two simultaneous experiments on one camera possible. The design has been used for combined out-of-plane sensitive TV holography and shearography experiments as well as for comparative applications. The two quantities can be measured precisely from one single experiment. The comparative configuration offers simultaneous visualisation of both the test object and its difference with respect to a master in real-time. It might become a useful tool in production quality control. In the last part, reciprocal principles are combined with TV holography techniques.

40|$|Recently, {{high speed}} cutting {{technology}} is widely adapted {{in the manufacturing}} process due to the increased demand of quality and productivity. Well-known high-speed cutting systems are motorized spindles. It {{is convinced that the}} profile of spindle rotation changes over the period of time due to the tool wear or tool change, which deteriorates not only machining quality but also tool life significantly. Therefore, automatic spindle balancing with respect to the spindle rotating condition becomes an essential requirement for high speed and high precision machining systems. This paper presents an automatic compensating scheme for spindle unbalance using an electromagnetic exciter (EME). The proposed scheme provides several advantages such as compensation of spindle unbalance-induced exciting force, spindle monitoring, and accurate control since it uses non-contact excitation based on electromagnetism. In the proposed system, the spindle unbalance-induced force is measured by vibration sensors and used as the feedback. Accordingly the electromagnetic force is applied to the spindle rotor in the counter side that corresponds with the measured unbalance force. In this paper, to implement the compensating system, the controller is designed and also the spindle-bearing system is built up.
