50|$|With the Apple I and the Apple II, Wozniak {{introduced}} an entirely novel {{configuration of the}} microcomputer concept which was immediately adopted as the industry standard, and remains taken for granted to this day—namely {{the integration of the}} standard input and output devices (the typewriter-style keyboard and the video display screen) into the computer itself. Until that time, microcomputer devices either had an extremely limited I/O capability—such as perhaps a hex keypad and a 16- or 32-character display, or no built-in user interface at all, following the convention of mainframe and minicomputers in requiring the connection of an external teleprinter unit or <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>terminal</b> to complete a usable system. The cost of such terminals could easily exceed the price of the computer itself. Wozniak's inclusion of an RF output which could connect to the aerial socket of a standard domestic television set enabled users to acquire a complete system without incurring the cost of a video monitor.|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of visual acuity {{is important for}} assessing the extent of visual fatigue. It is known that intensive visual task such as <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>terminal</b> work induce transient myopia on short-term basis after work. There are reports showing decreases in contrast sensitivity to high frequency spatial grating patterns after <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>terminal</b> work. The author developed a method of measuring grating acuity that corresponded to the maximum resolvable frequency for rectanglar spatial grating patterns with the constant contrast. This grating acuity reflects the linear response of high frequency spatial vision, and the method was applied {{for the evaluation of}} visual fatigue. The results showed that the {{measurement of}} grating acuity could significantly detect the slight transientmyopia effect. The suggested method is suffciently effective and reliable for evaluating visual fatigue in both laboratory experiments and field surveys...|$|E
40|$|Perhaps {{the four}} most popular 'ergonomic' office culprits are: (1) the {{computer}} or <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>terminal</b> (VDT); (2) the office chair; (3) the workstation; and (4) other automated {{equipment such as}} the facsimile machine, photocopier, etc. Among the ergonomics issues in the office environment are visual fatigue, musculoskeletal disorders, and radiation/electromagnetic (VLF,ELF) field exposure from VDT's. We address each of these in turn and then review some regulatory considerations regarding such stressors {{in the office and}} general industrial environment...|$|E

A {{method is}} {{described}} for predicting whether a <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>terminal</b> (VDT) will appear to flicker given the display phosphor persistence, refresh frequency, luminance {{and other environmental}} {{factors such as the}} distance between the user and the VDT. Based on research on human temporal sensitivity (Kelly 1969), one can predict the maximum screen luminance and the minimum refresh frequency that will generate a flicker-free display for a theoretical standard observer. These predictions are tested across a range of refresh frequencies, screen luminance, screen phosphors and individual users. 1...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate localized muscular fatigue induced during <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>terminal</b> (VDT) tasks. In the experimental paradigm used, electromyography (EMG) signals were not recorded during the VDT task but during isometric contractions in which the load imposed on the shoulder muscle was kept constant. The change in mean power frequency (MPF) and the root mean square values of EMG signals with time were explored. The correspondence between these measures and the psychological rating of localized muscular fatigue also were examined. The effectiveness of the experimental paradigm and of the measures used for evaluation of localized muscular fatigue are discussed. MPF measured during isometric contraction was found to be a sensitive measure of localized muscular fatigue. 1...|$|E

A study [4] on VDT work fatigue mentioned that most subjects complained of eye fatigue. This problem of eye fatigue should be of great concern.

40|$|Objective: The {{prevalence}} of neck and shoulder pain in <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>terminal</b> operators is estimated between 40 % and 69 %. One theory proposed {{for this is}} inadequate low load functioning of the postural muscles of the neck and shoulder girdle leading to microtrauma of cervical spine structures. A temporal sequence linking muscle performance to the subsequent development of neck pain has never been established. This pilot study sought to determine whether postural muscle performance factors are associated with neck pain in a population of <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>terminal</b> users. Methods: Twenty-eight subjects underwent a baseline physical examination. Clinical measurements of low-load deep cervical flexor muscle performance, shoulder girdle muscle endurance, neck column length, head and neck posture and body mass index were made and demographic factors collected. Following the examination, a Neck Pain and Disability Scale questionnaire was administered. Variables were analysed in a regression analysis with the questionnaire scores. Questionnaires were readministered at six months follow up. Results: Descriptive variables "years of occupational screen based keyboard use" (p = 0. 021) and "use of reading glasses" (p = 0. 027) were statistically significantly correlated with Neck Pain and Disability Scale score at baseline, while "hours of home computer use" (p < 0. 001) {{was associated with the}} change in questionnaire score at 6 months follow up. Muscle performance factors did not contribute to either model. Conclusions: Given the sample size in this pilot study, we cannot rule out an association between muscle parameters and the onset of neck pain and disability. However, the influence of any such association would be weaker than other identified associated variables...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the effects of a}} range of workstation factors upon the visual symptoms experienced by a group of 92 <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> <b>terminal</b> (VDT) users. Subjects in the study kept a diary over five consecutive working days in which they recorded the types of visual and postural symptoms which occurred and the types of work tasks being performed. Each subject's workstation was analysed for screen legibility and stability, discomfort and disability glare, and required head postures. By the use of multiple regression analysis techniques we have considered the relative contribution of these factors to the symptoms reported by the users of these workstations. Screen legibility significantly influenced the occurrence of symptoms of ocular discomfort and vertical head movements significantly affected the incidence of postural/headache symptoms...|$|E
