40|$|Introduction. The {{programs}} of distance education {{are in a}} great demand. Therefore, {{the problems of the}} organization in higher education institutions of educational process with the use of appropriate technologies have arisen. The aim of the publication is to set an example of introducing distance learning tools into higher education system, which could help to identify possible conditions and ways of creating a <b>virtual</b> <b>educational</b> <b>environment</b> covering in continuity three-cycle structure of higher education, as well as non-degree supplementary educational programs. Methodology and research methods. Basic research methods include comparative analysis, qualitative and quantitative methods based on empirical observation and data processing. The methodological base for the research included competence and student-centered approaches, psycho-didactic and acmeological approaches to lifelong learning. Results and scientific novelty. The role of distance educational technologies in ensuring availability and competitiveness of {{programs of}} the basic and continuing education is emphasized. The alternative choice of creating a <b>virtual</b> <b>educational</b> <b>environment</b> on the basis of distance learning technologies in a non-linguistic university is proved from linguodidactic basis. The interaction of principles, approaches, and conditions for its implementation and development are given. The research provides a model of an electronic teaching complex and a two-cluster model of the coursebook as a part of virtual educational unit.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of inter-school electronic networks {{has added a}} new dimension to education in Canada that has many implications for students who attend schools in rural communities. Collaborative internet-based teaching and learning and the creation of virtual classes within regional intranets now complement traditional on-site instruction in many schools that are located beyond major centres of population. Five stages in the advent of <b>virtual</b> <b>educational</b> <b>environments</b> can be identified starting with the {{introduction of}} computers in schools as a foundation for the development of collaborative teaching and learning environments. Inter-school collaboration in rural Canada and the extension of curriculum options for senior students has, in turn, provided a basis for the integration of virtual classes and traditional face to face instruction. Instruction in classes that are electronically-linked to other classes requires different skills from traditional face to face teaching and the development of new strategies and protocols. The implications of open and flexible teaching and learning for the future organization of classes, the preparation of teachers, articulation with higher education and in particular, regional economic development are now significant educational policy issues. The linking of virtual and face to face classes through cybercells is a possible next step in the development of <b>virtual</b> <b>educational</b> <b>environments...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract-As today {{technology}} has witnessed remarkable advancement {{in almost all}} branches, still much attention needs to be directed to helping those disadvantaged from essential facilities. Specifically, much attention must {{be paid to the}} virtual world as it is the main theme of today’s technology that makes a big world small. The virtual world is of much help to people with physical impartment. We need not forget those who are in the most need to such technology advancement, the handicapped people. In this paper, I propose a novel solution called “Adaptive Facility Middleware ” – a Service-Oriented Architecture-Based middleware- to be incorporated in <b>virtual</b> <b>educational</b> <b>environments</b> enabling the join of handicapped students who wish to earn their degrees despite of their disability. This middleware will not require any virtual learning entity to change its general structure; however, it can be smoothly integrated to the current virtual learning environment to extend its operation to include the handicapped students. The proposed middleware adheres to the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) which supports the integration of independent services. This makes the middleware extensible and interoperable...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In many {{educational}} institutes, learning {{management systems}} are essential parts of delivering class materials {{not only for}} on-line courses but also on-campus classes. The primary purpose of learning management system is to provide proper <b>virtual</b> <b>educational</b> <b>environments</b> and convenient communicational channels between instructors and students letting them to overcome the barrier {{of time and space}} for the general schooling. In this paper, we are investigating the security vulnerabilities in such learning management systems. Especially, we are examining the vulnerability discovery process in the two popular learning management systems, Moodle and Blackboard, using datasets spanning a decade. We applied two vulnerability discovery models to examine the vulnerability discovery process quantitatively. The discovery models allow us to estimate the approximate number of vulnerabilities likely to be discovered in software systems in the future. It also helps policy makers when they need to decide which learning management systems will be adopted for their organizations when security is an extremely important factor. Result shows that the vulnerability discovery process in learning management systems could be predictable which could be utilized for IT risk assessment in organizations having the systems...|$|R

40|$|Massively {{multiuser}} online games such as World of Warcraft employ {{computer controlled}} non-player characters and quest activities extensively in training/tutoring capacities. This approach is very effective and popular, incorporating active learning, incremental progress, and creative repetition. This paper explores ways to exploit this model in <b>educational</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>environments.</b> Non-player characters in such environments require a knowledge model, a dialogue model, and a user performance model, {{in addition to}} any physical and behavioral traits necessary to make them interesting and credible members of the environment. A first experiment with these ideas is an explicit attempt to embed a World of Warcraft-like tutoring non-player character in Second Life. Second Life supports virtual objects with scripting, but this facility is not particularly tailored to non-player characters or to education. With care, compatibly formatted web-based content, exercises, and quizzes are imported into Second Life, reducing the effort needed to create content. A second experiment with these ideas is to ask: What should non-player character construction by end user educators look like? A set of tools and libraries designed to reduce the effort required to construct educational non-player characters within a custom <b>educational</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>environment</b> is described.

Results informed the design of the first experiment that aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a virtual lecturer’s expressions on the students ’ learning outcomes in a virtual pedagogical environment. A second follow-up experiment then focussed on the effectiveness of a single facial expression (the smile) on student performance. Both experiments involved virtual lectures, with virtual lecturers teaching real students. Results indicated that students performed better (by 86 %) in the lectures where the virtual lecturer performed facial expressions compared to the results of the lectures that did not use facial expressions. However, this applied only for reasonably complex instructional material; when simple or basic instructional material was used the facial expressions of the virtual lecturer had no substantial effect on the students ’ learning outcome. Finally, it was demonstrated that the appropriate use of smiling increased the interest of the students and consequently their performance.
