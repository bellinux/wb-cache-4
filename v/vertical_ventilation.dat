50|$|In general, {{there are}} two types of ventilation; {{vertical}} and horizontal. Their names refer to the general locations of the intended exit points of the heat and smoke to be ventilated. <b>Vertical</b> <b>ventilation</b> takes place through holes cut in the roof, typically by truck companies during the early stages of a fire in a process known collectively as roof operations, while horizontal ventilation usually takes place through doors and windows. The goal of each is to clear heat and smoke to increase chances of survival for trapped occupants, and/or so that water lines can be advanced into the structure, to more effectively battle the flames. While their goals are similar, their applications are different, but still both require good timing and coordination so that increased air flow through a structure doesn't contribute to fire spread.|$|E

A RNG κ - ε turbulence model was applied to solve the turbulent duct flow. Fifteen particle size groups ranging from 5 to 200 μm are investigated with one-way coupling approach. The turbulent airflow and particle movement were validated by experimental data. Adopting the particle-wall impact model, the dimensionless deposition velocities have been predicted smaller than those using conventional "trap" model, especially for particles of large relaxation time. The dimensionless deposition velocity and deposition fraction would first increase, and then decrease with increasing particle diameter. The deposition and capture fraction would roughly decrease with increasing frictional velocity. Additionally, Saffman force has {{played an important role}} in this improved wall model. This paper has demonstrated that particle rebound could have a considerable effect on the deposition and concentration of large particles in rooms and ventilation ducts.

50|$|This {{structure}} also {{enables a}} 'natural ventilation' through the selective opening of windows. The 50 cm {{gap between the}} 17 cm thick floors and the glass encasing also allows for <b>vertical</b> <b>ventilation,</b> if needs be helped by opening glass hatches in the roof. And the glass allows for maximum entry of sunlight. Peutz reported after one year of use of the building, that experience had shown that the 50 cm gap was more than enough. In the early years, the gap has even been reduced in size in some places. In winter only the window flaps in the glass encasing need to be opened and the roof hatches can remain closed. During summer, on the sunny side the curtains should be closed and the hatches opened (note, though, that the south side is the one without glass). The result is a 'double wall' of glass on the outer side and curtains on the inner side, with an upward draft caused by the Sun's heat. This suffices for ventilation and the two surface ducts (as shown on the drawings) were partly intended for mechanical ventilation (with an exhauster fan), but this {{has turned out to}} be unnecessary. During winter, heating is done with a hot water installation (of course fuelled with coal) with natural circulation. The radiators along the windows now provide the heat for the circulation. The installed pumps have turned out to be unnecessary. The airtight glass walls have turned out to be better insulators than thought. Also, the mass of the concrete is such a good heat accumulator that extra time heating up the building in the morning has turned out unnecessary and there have never been any major temperature changes. This technology is being rediscovered and used, for example, by Canadian architect Chris Holmes in his energy-saving designs.|$|E

The concept realized by Mies van der Rohe in 1927, at his building for the Weissenhof district, is becoming a reality nowadays. The primary reason for flexibility is giving the user a choice.

40|$|The Liquid Waste Technology Development {{organization}} is investigating technologies to support closure of radioactive waste tanks at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Tank closure includes {{removal of the}} wastes that have propagated to the tank annulus. Although amounts and types of residual waste materials in the annuli of SRS tanks vary, simple salt deposits are predominant on tanks with known leak sites. This task focused on developing and demonstrating a technology to inspect and spot clean salt deposits from the outer primary tank wall located in the annulus of an SRS Type I tank. The Robotics, Remote and Specialty Equipment (RRSE) and Materials Science and Technology (MS&T) Sections of the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) collaborated to modify and equip a Force Institute magnetic wall crawler with the tools necessary to demonstrate the inspection and spot cleaning in a mock-up of a Type I tank annulus. A remote control camera arm and cleaning head were developed, fabricated and mounted on the crawler. The crawler was then tested and demonstrated on a salt simulant also developed in this task. The demonstration showed that the camera is capable of being deployed in all specified locations and provided the views needed for the planned inspection. It also showed that the salt simulant readily dissolves with water. The crawler features two different techniques for delivering water to dissolve the salt deposits. Both water spay nozzles were able to dissolve the simulated salt, one is more controllable and the other delivers a larger water volume. The cleaning head also includes a rotary brush to mechanically remove the simulated salt nodules in the event insoluble material is encountered. The rotary brush proved {{to be effective in}} removing the salt nodules, although some fine tuning may be required to achieve the best results. This report describes the design process for developing technology to add features to a commercial wall crawler and the results of the demonstration testing performed on the integrated system. The crawler was modified to address the two primary objectives of the task (inspection and spot cleaning). SRNL recommends this technology as a viable option for annulus inspection and salt removal in tanks with minimal salt deposits (such as Tanks 5 and 6.) This report further recommends that the technology be prepared for field deployment by: (1) developing an improved mounting system for the magnetic idler wheel, (2) improving the robustness of the cleaning tool mounting, (3) resolving the nozzle selection valve connections, (4) determining alternatives for the brush and bristle assembly, and (5) adding a protective housing around the motors to shield them from water splash. In addition, SRNL suggests further technology development to address annulus cleaning issues that are apparent on other tanks that will also require salt removal in the future such as: (1) Developing a duct drilling device to facilitate dissolving salt inside ventilation ducts and draining the solution out the bottom of the ducts.

The objectives of this thesis are: i) to study the types of courtyard configuration in existing linked houses; ii) to investigate the environmental condition of the courtyard and its effect to the indoor thermal comfort; iii) to explore the importance of courtyard configuration in providing good natural ventilation and iv) to determine the best courtyard configuration that create best indoor thermal comfort of a linked house. This study investigated two similar urban linked houses (with and without internal courtyard) in terms of size and specifications in Shah Alam and Klang. Data based on two days of measurements and observations at both houses for outdoor, indoor temperature, relative humidity and air velocity revealed that the indoor thermal conditions for both houses exceeded the thermal comfort zone recommended by Givoni's Bio-Climatic chart and ASHRAE. However, through comparative analysis, the house with internal centre courtyard produced better results and maintained a more comfortable indoor condition due to its horizontal and <b>vertical</b> natural cross <b>ventilation</b> which occurred during the day time and night time. Further predictive investigations on the courtyard linked house, based on CFD simulations using Flovent 7. 2 and AnSys were conducted. Three variations of design models were studied namely enlarged courtyard area, increased courtyard walls height and enlarged openings at the front and rear. Diurnal simulations concluded that the increased of courtyard surrounding wall height and enlarged openings at front and rear options were the most effective, whereas the enlarged courtyard area (footprint) type were less effective, regardless of which operation mode were applied. Hence, linked houses with courtyards are proven to be beneficial to the occupants by providing passive cooling through natural ventilation...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{is employed}} {{to study the}} dynamics over hypothetical urban areas in neutrally and stably stratified turbulent boundary layers. In neutral stratification, a total of 144 two-dimensional computational domains (18 different building-height-to-street-width (aspect) ratios with 8 distinct roof geometries) {{were used in the}} numerical simulations. In stable stratification, six three-dimensional computational domains with different stratifications (Froude number = 1. 7, 2. 4, 2. 8, 3. 1, 4. 0 and 4. 6) were used for the investigation of dynamics in interfacial flows with stationary hydraulic jump by the single layer hydraulic model. Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Strokes (RANS) and Large-Eddy-Simulation (LES) coupled with Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method were used in the numerical simulation of neutrally and stably stratified flows respectively. 	Friction factor (f) was proposed as a parameter to quantify the aerodynamic resistance over idealized urban geometries. Air change rate (ACH) and pollutant change rate (PCH) were suggested to appraise ventilation and pollutant removal at the roof level of street canyons in neutrally stratified turbulent boundary layer respectively. The fluctuation component of ACH was found to be directly proportional to f^(1 ⁄ 2) and PCH was found to behave distinctively in different flow regimes. Both fluctuation components of ACH and PCH dominated the ventilation and pollutant removal mechanism that could serve as the minimum performance indices. The vertical dispersion coefficient σ_z, which is a parameter commonly used in Gaussian plume model, was used to describe the dispersion characteristics after a pollutant line source placed at the street level. It was found that σ_z was directly proportional to f^(1 ⁄ 4) and the frictional force exerted by rough surfaces was able to alter the near-field and far-field behaviors of pollutant dispersion. 	Three different flow regimes, namely submerged hydraulic jump, stationary hydraulic jump and supercritical hydraulic jump were identified in stably stratified turbulent boundary layer modeled by the single layer hydraulic model. The dynamics were found completely different in each regime that must be analyzed separately. Detailed comparisons of <b>vertical</b> profiles and <b>ventilation</b> performance were reported for the flows in stationary hydraulic jump and supercritical hydraulic jump regime. Flows in stationary hydraulic jump regime were selected for in-depth analysis with different stratifications. It was found that the total ACH remained constant regardless the variation in flow stratification. Furthermore, the fluctuation and mean components of ACH increased and decreased with increasing stability respectively. This finding is quite different from our conventional understanding of the suppressed turbulence in strong stratification. Finally, the coherent structures of flow in stably stratified turbulent boundary layer with stationary hydraulic jump were closely inspected. A secondary turbulence production mechanism was found in the more stable stratification flows. The turbulence generated in higher stability also dissipated slower and traveled further. These findings explained the stronger fluctuation component of ACH in more stable environment. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
