25|$|While the planter {{class had}} persuaded poor whites to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> {{legislative}} effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due {{mostly to the}} imposition of a cumulative poll tax. By 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 African-Americans. Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote. Despite numerous legal challenges that succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement. The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.|$|E
2500|$|Marshall was {{strongly}} critical {{of this legislation}} during floor debate. [...] On the house floor in April 2007 he remarked, [...] "I cannot <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> bill because {{there are too many}} subterfuges in here trying to avoid responsibility and accountability. [...] Members of these regional governments -- and they are regional governments -- don't even have to vote on this until December. [...] What's interesting about December? It's {{a month and a half}} after the election. [...] They can all promise 'I'm not going to vote to raise any taxes' and then afterward they can vote to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2009, Harman {{proposed}} a rule change to exempt MPs' expenses from the Freedom of Information Act. Her parliamentary order aimed to remove [...] "most expenditure information held by either House of Parliament from {{the scope of}} the Freedom of Information Act". It meant that, under the law, journalists and members of the public would no longer be entitled to learn details of their MP's expenses. Labour MPs were to be pressured to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> measure by use of a three line whip. Her proposal was withdrawn when the Conservative Party said they would vote against, and an online campaign by mySociety. The failure of the motion led to the disclosure of expenses of British members of parliament.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the issue}} of the Iraq war, on October 11, 2002 Cantwell voted in favor of the Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq. Her October 10, 2002, press release, however, quotes her as stating {{on the floor of the}} U.S. Senate, [...] "... Mr. President, my <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> {{resolution}} does not mean that I am convinced of the Administration has answered all the questions. I believe the following issues must be addressed before the U.N. or the U.S. move forward with military action." [...] Cantwell detailed six specific areas in which her questions and concerns had yet to be satisfactorily addressed at the time of her vote to authorize war: [...] "First: Continued Multilateral Approach ... Second: Successful Military Strategy ... Third: A Postwar Commitment Strategy ... Fourth: Fighting the Broader War on Terrorism ... Fifth: Maintaining Middle East Stability ... Sixth: Protecting Iraqi Civilians." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{was similar}} tension when {{a vote on}} the Family Planning Bill was {{proposed}} in the Dáil by the Minister for Health, Charles Haughey. The legislation proposed that only married people with a prescription could be dispensed contraception and was described as [...] "an Irish solution to an Irish problem". Jim Gibbons, who was a devout Catholic and had a deep hatred of Haughey, failed to turn up and <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> important legislation. It was the only time when a TD, let alone a cabinet minister, was allowed flout the party whip in Fianna Fáil and damaged Lynch's authority when he failed to expel the minister from the government and parliamentary party. As well as this, a group of backbench TDs began to lobby other TDs in support of Charles Haughey, should a leadership election arise. This group, known as the [...] "gang of five," [...] consisted of Jackie Fahey, Tom McEllistrim, Seán Doherty, Mark Killilea and Albert Reynolds.|$|E

Hunter, a Republican, offered this resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces in Iraq in place of John Murtha's H.J.Res. 73, which called for redeployment [...] "at the earliest possible date." [...] In her prepared statement, McKinney accused the Republicans of [...] "trying to set a trap for the Democrats. A 'no' <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> Resolution will obscure {{the fact that there is}} strong support for withdrawal of US forces from Iraq ... In voting for this bill, let me be perfectly clear that I am not saying the United States should exit Iraq without a plan. I agree with Mr. Murtha that security and stability in Iraq should be pursued through diplomacy. I simply want to vote 'yes' to an orderly withdrawal from Iraq." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Florida, State Representative Joe Negron {{was picked}} to fill Foley's {{spot in the}} November elections. The Democratic nominee for the seat was Tim Mahoney. Florida law {{prohibited}} Foley's name from being removed from the ballot {{at the time of}} his withdrawal from the race, but Republicans hoped that voters would recognize that a vote for Foley would transfer to Negron as a substitute candidate. [...] Nevertheless, Boehner noted that because of the procedures in Florida, [...] "to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> candidate, you have to vote for Mark Foley. How many people are going to hold their nose to do that?" [...] Negron used the slogan, [...] "Punch Foley for Joe", having the double meaning of officially voting for Foley in order to really elect Negron as well as evoking images of physically striking the offending member of Congress. Foley's Republican-held seat was regarded as unlikely to change hands before the scandal broke, but CQPolitics changed its rating of the race from Safe Republican where it had stood since July to Leans Democratic in early-October. On Election Day, Mahoney won the seat.|$|E
2500|$|These migrants, or uitlanders as {{they were}} known, had the {{potential}} to change the Transvaal forever; by 1895 the Transvaal government estimated there to be 30000 Afrikaner voters (or burghers, {{as they were}} known), to 60000 uitlanders. [...] Kruger made every effort to keep the balance of power firmly in the burgher’s favour. [...] Initially, {{from the time of the}} first gold discoveries to 1890, uitlanders could obtain the right to vote after five years residence. [...] In 1890, as the extent of foreign immigration became clear, this residency requirement was increased to fourteen years, combined with a stipulation that applicants must be over forty years old. [...] In an attempt to compensate a new body, the Second Volksraad, was created with limited competence in designated legislative areas, all subject to the ratification of the Volksraad. [...] Uitlanders could gain the right to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> body after two years residence and the right to stand for election to it after four years. Despite this, the fact remained that at the same time as gold revenues served as the Transvaal’s main source of income, the uitlander mineworkers were denied any effective say in government.|$|E
2500|$|Byrd {{initially}} {{compiled a}} mixed {{record on the}} subjects of race relations and desegregation. [...] While he initially voted against civil rights legislation, in 1959 he hired one of the Capitol's first black congressional aides, and he also took steps to integrate the United States Capitol Police {{for the first time}} since Reconstruction. Beginning in the 1970s, Byrd explicitly renounced his earlier views favoring racial segregation. Byrd said that he regretted filibustering and voting against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and would change it if he had the opportunity. Byrd also said that his views changed dramatically after his teenage grandson was killed in a 1982 traffic accident, which put him in a deep emotional valley. [...] "The death of my grandson caused me to stop and think," [...] said Byrd, adding he came to realize [...] that African-Americans love their children as much as he does his. [...] During debate in 1983 over the passage of the law creating the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday, Byrd grasped the symbolism of the day and its significance to his legacy, telling members of his staff [...] "I'm the only one in the Senate who must <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> bill".|$|E

60|$|Next {{followed}} the truly singular {{struggle for the}} university chair of poetry {{at the end of}} the same year, between a no-popery candidate and a Puseyite. Seldom surely has the service of the muses been pressed into so alien a debate. Mr. Gladstone was cut to the heart at the prospect of a sentence in the shape of a <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> professorship, passed by the university of Oxford 'upon all that congeries of opinions which the rude popular notion associates with the Tracts for the Times.' Such a sentence would be a disavowal by the university of catholic principles in the gross; the association between catholic principles and the church of England would be miserably weakened; and those who at all sympathised with the Tracts would be placed in the position of aliens, corporally within the pale, but in spirit estranged or outcast. If the church should be thus broken up, there would be no space for catholicity between the rival pretensions of an ultra-protestantised or decatholicised English church, and the communion of Rome. 'Miserable choice!' These and other arguments are strongly pressed (December 3, 1841) in favour of an amicable compromise, in a letter addressed to his close friend Frederic Rogers. In the same letter Mr. Gladstone says that he cannot profess to understand or to have studied the Tracts on Reserve.[183] He 'partakes perhaps in the popular prejudice against them.' Anybody can now see in the coolness of distant time that it was these writings on Reserve that roused not merely prejudice but fury in the public mind--a fury that without either justice or logic extended from hatred of Romanisers to members of the church of Rome itself. It affected for the worse the feeling between England and Ireland, for in those days to be ultra-protestant was to be anti-Irish; and it greatly aggravated, first the storm about the Maynooth grant in 1845, and then the far wilder storm about the papal aggression six years later.|$|E
