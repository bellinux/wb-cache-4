None of the species are venomous. Six amphibian species have been documented including the Columbia spotted frog, boreal chorus frog, tiger salamander and the increasingly rare boreal toad and northern leopard frog. A sixth amphibian species, the bullfrog, was introduced. An estimated 10,000 insect species frequent the park; they pollinate plants, provide a food source for birds, fish, mammals and other animals, and help in the decomposition of wood. In one example of the importance of insects to the ecosystem, swarms of Army cutworm moths die in huge numbers after mating and provide a high fat and protein diet for bears and other predators. One study concluded that when this moth species is most available, bears consume 40,000 moths per day which is roughly 20,000kcal/day.|$|E

50|$|The Tepalcatepec <b>Valley</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> (Thamnophis postremus) is {{a species}} of snake of the family Colubridae. It is found in Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Valley</b> <b>Garter</b> <b>Snake</b> (Thamnophis sirtalis fitchi) is a {{subspecies}} of {{the common}} garter snake. It is a snake indigenous to North America. Most garter snakes have a pattern of yellow stripes on a brown background and their average length is about 1 m to 1.5 m. The common garter snake is a diurnal snake. In summer, it is most active {{in the morning and}} late afternoon; in cooler seasons or climates, it restricts its activity to the warm afternoons.|$|E
5000|$|Of {{the larger}} mammals {{the most common}} are elk, which exist in the thousands. [...] Their {{migration}} route between the National Elk Refuge and Yellowstone National Park is through Grand Teton National Park, so while easily seen anytime of the year, they are most numerous {{in the spring and}} fall. Other ungulates include bison and pronghorn—the fastest land mammal in the western hemisphere—which are found throughout Jackson Hole as are moose, which tend to stay near waterways and wetlands. Between 100-125 bighorn sheep dwell in the alpine and rocky zones of the peaks.Over 300 species of birds have been sighted in the park including the calliope hummingbird, the smallest bird species in North America, as well as trumpeter swans, which is North America's largest waterfowl. In addition to trumpeter swans, another 30 species of waterfowl have been recorded including blue-winged teal, common merganser, American wigeon and the colorful but reclusive harlequin duck which is occasionally spotted in Cascade Canyon. Both bald and golden eagles and other birds of prey such as the osprey, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel and occasional sightings of peregrine falcon have been reported. Of the 14 species of owls reported, the most common is the great horned owl, though the boreal owl and great grey owl are also seen occasionally. A dozen species of woodpeckers have been reported, as have a similar number of species of warblers, plovers and gulls. The vocal and gregarious black-billed magpie frequents campgrounds while Steller's jay and Clark's nutcracker are found in the backcountry. The sage covered plains of Jackson Hole are favored areas for sage grouse, Brewer's sparrow and sage thrashers, while the wetlands are frequented by great blue heron, American white pelican, sandhill crane and on rare occasions it's endangered relative, the whooping crane.The Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout (or Snake River cutthroat trout) is the only native trout species in Grand Teton National Park. It is also the only subspecies of cutthroat trout that is exclusively native to large streams and rivers. Various researchers {{have not been able to}} identify any genetic differences between the Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout and the Yellowstone cutthroat trout, though in terms of appearances, the Snake River subspecies has much smaller spots which cover a greater portion of the body, and the two subspecies inhabit different ecological niches. The Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout was identified by some researchers as a separate subspecies by the mid-1990s, and is managed as a distinct subspecies by the state of Wyoming, but is not yet recognized as such by the neighboring states of Idaho and Montana. Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout is found only in the Snake River and tributaries below the Jackson Lake dam to the Palisades Reservoir in Idaho. Other non-native species of trout such as the rainbow trout and lake trout were introduced by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department or migrated out of Yellowstone. Today five trout species inhabit park waters. Native species of fish include the mountain whitefish, longnose dace, mountain sucker and non-native species include the Utah chub and Arctic grayling.Only four species of reptiles are documented in the park: three species of snakes which are the wandering garter snake, the less commonly seen <b>valley</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> and rubber boa, as well as one lizard species, the northern sagebrush lizard, that was first reported in 1992.

50|$|One {{feature that}} distinguishes the Chicago <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> from other <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> subspecies, {{especially}} the eastern <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> (Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis), is, in Thamnophis sirtalis semifasciatus, the snake's side stripe is broken, near the snake's head, into a dashed line by black crossbars.|$|R
2500|$|San Francisco <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> forage {{extensively}} in aquatic habitats. Adult snakes feed primarily on California red-legged frogs (Rana draytonii), which are federally listed as threatened. They may also feed on juvenile bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), {{but they are}} unable to consume adults; in fact, adult bullfrogs prey on juvenile <b>garter</b> <b>snakes,</b> and may be a contributing factor in the population decline of the San Francisco <b>garter</b> <b>snake.</b> Newborn and juvenile San Francisco <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> depend heavily upon Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla [...] ) as prey. If newly metamorphosed Pacific treefrogs are not available, the young <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> may not survive.

5000|$|The saliva of {{a common}} <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> may be toxic to {{amphibians}} and other small animals. <b>Garter</b> <b>snakes</b> were researched and studies show they have a mild venom in their saliva. For humans, a bite is not dangerous, though it may cause slight itching, burning, and/or swelling. Most common <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> also secrete a foul-smelling fluid from postanal glands when handled or harmed.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many species}} of North American <b>garter</b> <b>snake,</b> the western {{terrestrial}} <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> possesses a mildly venomous saliva. Specimens collected from Idaho and Washington produced venom with myonecrotic (muscle tissue-killing) effects when injected into the gastrocnemius muscles of mice. Several cases of mild human envenomation with local edema and other symptoms (but without any systemic symptoms) have occurred from the wandering <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> subspecies, including in Colorado.|$|R
50|$|Studies {{show that}} the warmer the {{temperature}} of a <b>garter</b> <b>snake,</b> the more likely the snake is to flee a predator; a snake with a cooler body temperature remains stationary or attacks. Male <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> {{are also more likely}} to flee. <b>Garter</b> <b>snakes</b> that exhibit more aggressive anti-predatory displays tend to also be fast and have high stamina. However the cause for correlation is unknown.|$|R
50|$|T. sirtalis, T. marcianus and T. sauritus are {{the most}} popular species of <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> kept in captivity. Baby <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> shed their first skin almost immediately, and will begin eating soon after. <b>Garter</b> <b>snakes</b> just require a 10-gallon (38 liter) terrarium. The first {{shedding}} is very fine and often disintegrates in minutes under the slithering masses of new <b>snakes.</b> Feeding baby <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> can be tricky; earth worms (not compost worms), night crawlers (called dew worms in Canada), silversides (fish), or cut up pieces of pinky mice (thawed fully and waved before the snake on a pair of tongs or hemostats to avoid nipping fingers) will entice appetites. Up to 10 days may pass before a baby <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> eats; it takes them some time to become accustomed to new settings.|$|R
50|$|The {{checkered}} <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> is {{the easiest}} <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> to tame. Even a wild-caught one can become tame {{in a few days}} if handled carefully. The checkered <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> is frequently available in the exotic pet trade, and makes a hardy captive animal. It can be trained to accept mice or fish fillets as food. Captive breeding, while not common, is done, and albino variants are being produced.|$|R
2500|$|For a {{brief period}} from 1996 to 2000 there was {{confusion}} over the differentiation of the San Francisco <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> from two other subspecies, known as the California red-sided <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> (T. s. infernalis) and the Oregon red-spotted <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> (T. s. concinnus). Barry petitioned [...] the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) to suppress the changes proposed in 1996 to merge two of these species. In 2000, the ICZN agreed and voted to retain the historical taxonomic arrangement of subspecies within this evolutionary lineage. Accordingly, the subspecies tetrataenia was reaffirmed for the San Francisco <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> and the races concinnus and infernalis retain their historical definition.|$|R
40|$|Pheromones are {{chemical}} cues used {{to communicate}} between individuals {{within a single}} species.

50|$|If disturbed, a <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> may coil and strike, but {{typically}} it will hide {{its head and}} flail its tail. These snakes will also discharge a malodorous, musky-scented secretion from a gland near the cloaca. They often use these techniques to escape when ensnared by a predator. They will also slither into the water to escape a predator on land. Hawks, crows, raccoons, crayfish, and other snake species (such as the coral snake and king <b>snake)</b> will eat <b>garter</b> <b>snakes,</b> with even shrews and frogs eating the juveniles.Being heterothermic, like all reptiles, <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> bask in the sun to regulate their body temperature.
