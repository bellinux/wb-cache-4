Their studies of the Albanian language were significantly influenced by Meksi's Bible translation.|$|E
5|$|Baltic German {{astronomer}} Hermann Struve {{used the}} observed {{changes in the}} orbits of the Martian moons to determine the gravitational influence of the planet's oblate shape. In 1895, he used this data to estimate that the equatorial diameter was 1/190 larger than the polar diameter. In 1911, he refined the <b>value</b> <b>to</b> 1/192. This result was confirmed by American meteorologist Edgar W. Woolard in 1944.|$|E

5|$|First {{described}} in 1927 by the West Australian botanist Charles Gardner, the species {{was at one}} stage considered a variety of B.sphaerocarpa. Although there are no recognised subspecies or varieties, both lignotuberous and nonlignotuberous forms exist for Banksia violacea. Wasps, ants and flies have been recorded visiting flower spikes. Banksia violacea is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. Regarded as of little <b>value</b> <b>to</b> floriculture, it is rarely cultivated.|$|E

Arago and Biot extended the survey to the island of Formentera in the western Mediterranean Sea in 1806–1809, and found that one ten-millionth of the Earth's quadrant should be 443.31lignes: later work increased the <b>value</b> <b>to</b> 443.39lignes.
