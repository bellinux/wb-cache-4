40|$|At {{a private}} for-profit {{hospitality}} college in Philadelphia, there are rising percentages of students not persisting to the sophomore year. The study was grounded by the theoretical framework of Tinto 2 ̆ 7 s model of student retention. The {{purpose of this}} causal comparative {{study was to examine}} the relationship between student persistence and the academic variables of major, <b>vocational</b> technical <b>preparation,</b> and provisional acceptance. The relationship was analyzed using a chi-square test of independence. The data collected for the study came from archival data based upon the sample of 162 full-time students enrolled during the August 2014 class start in the majors of Culinary Arts, Pastry Arts, Restaurant Management, and Hotel Management. The results displayed that persistence is dependent on the student major of choice and students who had <b>vocational</b> technical <b>preparation.</b> However, the results displayed that persistence was most likely independent of students who were provisionally accepted, suggesting that provisional acceptance had no influence on whether students persisted from freshmen to sophomore year or not. The implications for positive social change on the local level include providing research-based findings on variables associated with first-year student persistence to inform targeted student support services and ultimately improve student persistence at the institution studied. A professional development workshop has been created to educate faculty and staff at the college about the results of the study. The implications for positive social change outside of the institution include a higher number of students who are qualified to obtain jobs and positively help their communities grow and develop...|$|R

Consequently, the West High curriculum initially emphasized <b>vocational</b> <b>preparation,</b> rather than academics. A large homemaking department taught students family budgeting, food preparation, child care and family relations. The school's business education department taught secretarial training, stenography, retail selling and business. An industrial education department taught woodworking, metalworking, auto mechanics, electrical work, printing, mechanical drawing and other trades.

It adopted the classical design for change experiment (i. e. before and after measures) with eighty-eight subjects (60 males and 28 females) from two schools purposively selected while the classes remained intact. Three objectives and one null hypothesis were formulated to conceptualize the study. The instruments used for the study were two, namely: Agricultural Skill Performance Test (ASPT) and Observer’s Rating Scale (ORS); and the data obtained were analyzed using frequency, percentages, graphs and point-biserial correlation co-efficient. The results revealed that 47. 73 % of the subjects received occupational work experience in schools whereas 52. 27 % did not; and out of the proportion of (52. 27 %) representing 46 subjects, 60. 87 % received outside the school but 39. 13 % had no opportunity at all.

However, the 1980s ushered in a new era of prison privatization. With a burgeoning prison population resulting from the War on Drugs and increased use of incarceration, prison overcrowding and rising costs became increasingly problematic for local, state, and federal governments. In response to this expanding criminal justice system, private business interests saw an opportunity for expansion, and consequently, private-sector involvement in prisons moved from the simple contracting of services to contracting for the complete management and operation of entire prisons.|$|R

The original campus was located in Somerville, Massachusetts, and was moved to the current Beacon Street location in 1939. The Beacon Street site is featured on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail. During the 1940s, the College was split into two separate entities: The Fisher School for Men and The Fisher School for Women. In 1975, the Division of Accelerated and Professional Studies was established. Today, the Division of Accelerated and Professional Studies (DAPS) offers degree programs at their Boston, North Attleboro, Brockton, and New Bedford locations.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{describes}} {{the existence and}} nature of services within state child and adult mental health systems that support the transition from adolescence to adulthood. METHODS: State child and adult mental health administrators from all but one state were interviewed by telephone with a semistructured questionnaire regarding transition services in their state mental health system, such as supported housing, <b>vocational</b> support, <b>preparation</b> for independent living, and dual diagnosis treatment. Eight states were deemed sufficiently decentralized to render state-level administrator reports invalid. Specific service data from the remaining 41 states and the District of Columbia were analyzed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: One-quarter of child state mental health systems and one-half of adult state mental health systems offered no transition services, and few provided any kind of transition service at more than one site. Most types of transition services were available at all in less than 20 percent of the states. CONCLUSIONS: Across the United States transition support services are lacking.
