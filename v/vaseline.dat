5|$|Penn's brother {{revealed}} {{two days}} after the bout that the Penn camp would be making a formal complaint to the NSAC. In addition, Penn's head coach, Rudy Valentino alleged that St-Pierre also had an illegal substance on his body during his April 2008 rematch with Matt Serra. NSAC Executive Director Keith Kizer confirmed that improprieties had occurred in St-Pierre's corner. He witnessed St-Pierre's cornerman Phil Nurse apply <b>Vaseline</b> to St-Pierre's face and then immediately rub St-Pierre's shoulders and back before Nurse wiped his hands. Kizer had St-Pierre's back wiped down after the second round, and confirmed after the third round that no <b>Vaseline</b> was being applied. Kizer was critical of the cornerman's action, but expressed doubts that the controversy would overturn St-Pierre's victory.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} after her sinking, many impractical, {{expensive}} and often physically impossible schemes have been put forward to raise Titanic from her resting place. They have included ideas such as filling the wreck with ping-pong balls, injecting it with 180,000 tons of <b>Vaseline,</b> or using half a million tons of liquid nitrogen to encase it inside a giant iceberg that would float back to the surface. However, the wreck is far too fragile to be raised and is now protected by a UNESCO convention.|$|E

The man, identified by police as Mahoud Samed Almahadin, was charged with burglary, criminal mischief, and aggravated harassment as hate crimes. Two weeks later, 21-year-old film student and Anonymous member Jacob Speregen was charged with aggravated harassment and criminal mischief as hate crimes after he filmed Almahadin carrying out his prank.

However, an overweight accomplice struggled to get through the hole, and opened the window, setting off a silent alarm and alerting police. Carmack was arrested, and sent for psychiatric evaluation (the report mentions 'no empathy for other human beings' and describes Carmack as 'a brain on legs').

25|$|For {{external}} exposure, bathing the {{mucous membrane}} surfaces that have contacted capsaicin with oily compounds such as vegetable oil, paraffin oil, petroleum jelly (<b>Vaseline),</b> creams, or polyethylene glycol {{is the most}} effective way to attenuate the associated discomfort; since oil and capsaicin are both hydrophobic hydrocarbons the capsaicin that has not already been absorbed into tissues will be picked up into solution and easily removed. Capsaicin can also be washed off the skin using soap, shampoo, or other detergents. Plain water is ineffective at removing capsaicin, as are bleach, sodium metabisulfite and topical antacid suspensions. Capsaicin is soluble in alcohol, which can be used to clean contaminated items.|$|E
25|$|Several {{times during}} the episodes {{produced}} during the writer's strike, O'Brien would kill time by spinning his wedding ring on his desk, which he previously only did during rehearsals. His personal best was 41 seconds, achieved during an un-aired rehearsal. After several unsuccessful on-air attempts to break his record, during the show originally broadcast on February 9, 2008, O'Brien broke his record for endurance ring spinning, setting a time of 51 seconds by coating his wedding ring with <b>Vaseline</b> and spinning it on a Teflon surface. The feat was accomplished {{with the help of}} MIT physics professor Peter Fisher. These episodes are considered by most fans to be the magnum opus of O'Brien's television career, considering the spontaneity of each episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{contest between}} St-Pierre and Penn {{was a source}} of {{significant}} controversy. In between rounds one and two, as well as round three, one of St-Pierre's cornermen, Phil Nurse, was seen applying petroleum jelly (brand name <b>Vaseline)</b> on the shoulder and the back of St-Pierre by members of the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC). <b>Vaseline</b> is used to aid cuts in boxing as well as MMA, but applying it to parts of the body other than the face is illegal because of the element of grappling in the sport. A fighter that is [...] "slippery" [...] {{as a result of the}} <b>vaseline</b> will have an added advantage, because friction and grip are compromised. UFC President Dana White addressed the issue during a radio appearance in Boston, Massachusetts. He indicated that he did not believe the <b>vaseline</b> influenced the outcome of the fight, but still expected Nurse to be punished.|$|E
