5|$|B. verticillata is {{significantly}} threatened {{by at least}} three microorganisms. Several populations have reduced or <b>vanished</b> <b>from</b> dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi), such as those at Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve and Gull Rock National Park. The honey fungus Armillaria luteobubalina has killed plants in Torndirrup National Park, and aerial canker (Zythiostroma) has decimated populations at Waychinicup National Park east of Albany.|$|E
5|$|Hunters {{threaten}} the black stork {{in some countries}} of southern Europe and Asia, such as Pakistan, and breeding populations may have been eliminated there. The black stork <b>vanished</b> <b>from</b> the Ticino River valley in northern Italy, with hunting a likely contributor. In 2005, black storks were released into the Parco Lombardo del Ticino {{in an attempt to}} re-establish the species there.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} {{chaos of}} the civil war brought the introduction of legal tender notes, backed only by the credit of the government, and by mid-1862, gold and silver coins had <b>vanished</b> <b>from</b> circulation in much of the nation, their place taken by such makeshifts as fractional currency and postage stamps. The three-cent silver remained in circulation longer than the other silver coins, apparently because the public thought it was still made of debased silver, but by the autumn of 1862, it too was hoarded. With little point to issuing coins that would not circulate, mintage of the three-cent silver dropped from 343,000 in 1862 to 21,000 in 1863, a figure that would be exceeded only once (22,000 in 1866) {{during the rest of the}} series. In March 1863, Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase wrote in a letter that the three-cent silver had entirely <b>vanished</b> <b>from</b> circulation, and suggested that it be issued in aluminum to avoid hoarding.|$|E
5|$|Although {{bought at}} the auction (it is {{believed}} by Barwicks of London) by December 1935, Lew was working for Sidney Castle, the dismantler of the railway. This work was completed by July 1936 and in September, Lew was moved by rail to Swansea and loaded onto the S.S. Sabor destined for the port of Pernambuco (since renamed Recife), Brazil. Most of the relevant shipping records were destroyed in World War II, Lew then <b>vanished</b> <b>from</b> history and despite several attempts, {{no trace of the}} locomotive, or evidence of its fate, has so far been found.|$|E

5|$|Many other {{endemic species}} of Réunion became extinct after {{the arrival of}} man and the {{resulting}} disruption of the island's ecosystem. The Mascarene parrot lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the hoopoe starling, the Réunion ibis, the Réunion parakeet, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the Réunion swamphen, the Réunion owl, the Réunion night heron, and the Réunion pink pigeon. Extinct Réunion reptiles include the Réunion giant tortoise and an undescribed Leiolopisma skink. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Réunion and Mauritius but <b>vanished</b> <b>from</b> both islands.|$|E
5|$|Of the pardoned mutineers, Heywood and Morrison {{returned}} to naval duty. Heywood acquired the patronage of Hood and, by 1803 {{at the age}} of 31, had achieved the rank of captain. After a distinguished career, he died in 1831. Morrison became a master gunner, and was eventually lost in 1807 when HMS Blenheim foundered in the Indian Ocean. Muspratt is believed to have worked as a naval steward before his death, in or before 1798. The other principal participants in the court martial—Fryer, Peckover, Coleman, McIntosh and others—generally <b>vanished</b> <b>from</b> the public eye after the closing of the procedures.|$|E
5|$|The corn crake breeds from Britain and Ireland east through Europe {{to central}} Siberia. Although it has <b>vanished</b> <b>from</b> {{much of its}} {{historic}} range, this bird was once found in suitable habitats in Eurasia everywhere between latitudes 41°N and 62°N. There is also a sizable population in western China, but this species nests only rarely in northern Spain and in Turkey. Old claims of breeding in South Africa are incorrect, and result from misidentification of eggs in a museum collection which are actually those of the African rail.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} the only {{remaining}} native parrot in Puerto Rico and has been listed as critically endangered by the World Conservation Union since 1994. Once widespread and abundant, the population declined drastically in the 19th and early 20th centuries with the removal of most of its native habitat; the species completely <b>vanished</b> <b>from</b> Vieques and Mona Island, nearby to the main island of Puerto Rico. Conservation efforts commenced in 1968 to save the bird from extinction. In 2012, the total estimated population was 58–80 individuals in the wild and over 300 individuals in captivity.|$|E
5|$|A gold dollar coin {{had been}} {{proposed}} {{several times in}} the 1830s and 1840s, but was not initially adopted. Congress was finally galvanized into action by the increased supply of bullion caused by the California gold rush, and in 1849 authorized a gold dollar. In its early years, silver coins were being hoarded or exported, and the gold dollar found a ready place in commerce. Silver again circulated after Congress in 1853 required that new coins of that metal be made lighter, and the gold dollar became a rarity in commerce even before federal coins <b>vanished</b> <b>from</b> circulation because of the economic disruption caused by the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Around 1800, Caernarfon's local {{corporation}} {{undertook a}} programme of modernisation work, inserting several new gateways {{in the town}} walls; other changes were also made to the walls during the period, with some towers being converted for use as administrative buildings and the gatehouses altered to accommodate more modern offices. During the 19th century the town of Caernarfon grew considerably, prompted by the slate trade {{and the construction of}} the Chester to Holyhead railway line. As a result of this population pressure, by the 20th century housing had encroached along the inside and outside of the town walls, so that in many places the walls had <b>vanished</b> <b>from</b> view. During the 20th century the walls were gradually acquired by the state and these houses demolished.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, {{the only}} Class-A fishery {{waters in the}} Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} were those of Little Nescopeck Creek A, the headwaters of Nescopeck Creek, and several minor tributaries of Nescopeck Creek. Only one small stream near Nescopeck Creek's mouth had Class-C fishery waters. The central part of Nescopeck Creek, {{as well as most}} of Black Creek had Class-D fishery waters. There were twenty species of fish in Nescopeck Creek in 1999. Of these, seventeen had been seen in the watershed before. However, since between a 1999 study of the watershed and the study before that, the brown bullhead and the bluegill fish had <b>vanished</b> <b>from</b> the Nescopeck Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|In January 1953, Plante {{was called}} up {{to play for the}} Canadiens. Bill Durnan, the goaltender who played for Montreal when Plante first began, had retired, and Gerry McNeil—their top goaltender—had {{fractured}} his jaw. Plante played for three games, but in that short time, he generated controversy. Coach Dick Irvin, Sr. did not wish his players to stand out by any addition to their regular uniforms. Plante always wore one of his tuques while playing hockey, and after an argument with Irvin, all of Plante's tuques had <b>vanished</b> <b>from</b> the Montreal locker room. Even without his good luck charm, Plante gave up only four goals in the three games he played, all of them wins.|$|E
5|$|It {{would take}} until 1982 before serious {{consideration}} {{was given to}} any expressway plan. While most of the planned 1963 routes had <b>vanished</b> <b>from</b> the drawing board, a north–south link through the Red Hill Valley Creek and an east–west route along the brow of the escarpment remained in place. An environmental assessment of both links began and was approved in 1985. However, expressway opponents launched {{an appeal to the}} provincial cabinet. This appeal was rejected in 1987, and engineering began. Preliminary designs were submitted to the Regional Municipality of Hamilton–Wentworth and approved in April 1990. Construction began immediately on structures to carry three routes (two road and one rail) over the future Red Hill Valley Parkway.|$|E

5|$|Red wattlebirds are {{adversely}} {{impacted by}} land and undergrowth clearing, and have <b>vanished</b> <b>from</b> some habitats thus altered. Despite this, they {{are classified as}} Least Concern on the IUCN Red List as they occur over a wide range, have a large population, and the population decline is not rapid. Red wattlebirds are regularly killed by cats and dogs, {{as well as being}} hit by cars on roads. In 1924 in northern Victoria, the red wattlebird was described as very wary, on account of being highly regarded (and shot) for its meat. Indeed, it was shot widely for food or sport, or because it was held to be a pest of vineyards or orchards. On occasion, red wattlebirds have raided vineyards and orchards for grapes, stone fruit, figs, olives, loquats, apples, pears and berries, which they puncture and extract the juice or flesh from.|$|E
5|$|The main Allied {{detector}} at {{this time}} was the Magnetic Airborne Detector (MAD). MAD entered service in 1943, only to find its targets had <b>vanished</b> <b>from</b> coastal waters. It was able to plot and recognise distortions in Earth's magnetic field caused by submarines. It took some skill to use and only worked if it was directly above the target. It also was only effective at low altitudes. It had some success in the Gibraltar strait, but was ineffective in British waters owing to different conditions. The only recorded MAD victory in British waters was the sinking of U-1055 on 30 April 1945 off Ushant. Another invention was the American 3-cm radar and sonobuoy. These devices, along with the Mark 24 Mine (Fido), {{was responsible for the}} destruction of U-905 and U-296, sunk by No. 86 Squadron RAF and No. 120 Squadron RAF.|$|E
5|$|When Marseille {{returned}} to his unit he asked his friends Franzisket, Clade and Schröer, whether they had heard {{what was happening to}} Jews and if perhaps something was underway {{that they did not know}} about. Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had <b>vanished</b> <b>from</b> his neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, or people changed the subject or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He never spoke of this with his comrades again.|$|E
