Content validity {{requires the use of}} recognized subject matter experts to evaluate whether test items assess defined content and more rigorous statistical tests than does the assessment of face validity. Content validity is most often addressed in academic and <b>vocational</b> <b>testing,</b> where test items need to reflect the knowledge actually required for a given topic area (e.g., history) or job skill (e.g., accounting).

His master's thesis, titled [...] "The Present Status of Psychology", is {{a review of the}} history of the field of psychology and how the role of psychology was viewed in the early 20th century. He then studied under Harvey A. Carr at the University of Chicago. He studied a variety of topics while at the University of Chicago, including suggestibility and intelligence in delinquents, time perception, neuropsychological and <b>vocational</b> <b>testing,</b> and the reliability and validity of the Pressey X-O test. [...] His doctoral dissertation was titled [...] "A study in the psychology of testimony." [...] Following the completion of his dissertation, McGeoch’s work primarily focused on human learning and memory. Harvey Carr significantly influenced McGeoch’s work, and provided feedback on the McGeoch's introductory textbook on human learning, The Psychology of Human Learning, which was published after Carr’s death in 1943. McGeoch completed his PhD while he was a faculty member at the University of Washington. [...] He accepted a full Professor position 2 years later at the University of Arkansas. [...] In 1930 he moved to the University of Missouri where he became the chair of the department of psychology. He held this position for 5 years before moving to Wesleyan University, where he was also chair of the department from 1935-1939 and was awarded an honorary degree in recognition of his accomplishments as a lecturer and administrator.

40|$|In Australia, {{all school}} {{teachers}} {{are required to}} have completed teacher education courses, usually four years of study, in higher education institutions. Teachers then gain certification or registration through an appropriate body in their home state or territory. The same body sets professional standards and accredits the teacher education courses. Till now these have been considered appropriate mechanisms for the preparation of quality Australian teachers. In the latest declaration of national goals of schooling, 1 the Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers signaled interest in involvement in teacher preservice education. The Commonwealth Government has launched a $ 50 m initiative to 'Improve Teacher Quality' including a 'National Teaching Professional Framework [to] provide nationally agreed and consistent requirements and principles to guide reform {{in the areas of}} teacher registration, accreditation of pre-service teacher education courses and accreditation of teachers at the graduate, competent, highly accomplished and lead teacher levels'. Recently, the Queensland Government has supported a recommendation by Dr Geoff Masters, the Director of ACER (Australia's largest test development organisation), that 'aspiring primary teachers be required to demonstrate through test performances, as a condition of registration, that they meet threshold levels of knowledge about the teaching of literacy, numeracy and science and have sound levels of content knowledge in these areas', 2 with the Queensland College of Teaching to take responsibility for developing and administering such tests. Given the Commonwealth directions on school testing and the publication of the MySchools website with national test data, {{it is possible that the}} Commonwealth agenda to direct teacher preparation may align with the Queensland directions. Teacher competency tests are used in a number of states in the US, and have given rise to a number of legal issues. Such <b>vocational</b> <b>testing</b> requires a higher standard of test quality than testing children on basic competencies. This paper will examine both legal issues that have arisen in case law on teacher competency testing in the US and issues that have arisen in Australian case law in assessment and vocational assessment to prepare teachers, administrators and lawyers for such testing in Australia.

40|$|While {{operating}} a locomotive or a railcar the engine drivers {{are exposed to}} the action of several simultaneous factors of disturbances from the traffic environment, and therefore their reliability and safety are reduced. The human-determined physical, sensor and cognitive factors are not only the attributes of the engine driver, but also include influences from the traffic environment, due to the interaction in the “engine driver – traffic means – traffic environment” system. Traffic environment is defined in such a way that, among other things, it includes also the working environment of the drivers cab and the recent traffic situation. The action of factors of temporary subjective disturbances and/or permanent psychological and physiological changes, depend not only on the individual endurance of engine drivers, but also significantly on the type of locomotive or railcar operated by the engine driver, {{as well as on the}} fact whether the traffic is intended for the transport of passengers and/or freight, or a shunting engine is involved. The ergo-assessment based on a survey of 50 respondents yielded the final results that are almost identical to the results of ergo-assessment obtained during the formation of the methodology of cognitive ergo-assessment on a sample of 31 respondents. In both cases the surveyed respondents were engine drivers who in practice operate all types of locomotives and railcars, who have acquired engine driver secondary school qualifications and have passed <b>vocational</b> <b>testing</b> for all types of locomotives and railcars. Systemic ergo-assessment of the intensity of the overall psychophysical effort is possible by introducing the index of importance which is used in case of all engine drivers to integrally and equally recognise also the influence of the percentage of occurrence of a certain factor of subjective disturbance and influence of the average assessment of the subjective disturbance intensity, thus allowing an insight into the structure of a system of simultaneous ergo-assessment factors and isolation of ten dominant ergo-assessment factors. Partial cognitive ergo-assessment and inter-comparison of the intensity of subjective disturbances have indicated the types of locomotives and/or railcar compositions in which the maximum partial intensity of disturbance is due to the following factors regarding the working ambient of the drivers cab: visibility, intensity of the difficulty of operation, and intensity of disturbance of the audible traffic noise.

As a personnel test the Wonderlic is used to gauge an applicant's job potential, educational potential, and training potential.

However, {{a study conducted by}} psychologists Kazmier and Browne (1959) shows that neither of these forms can be regarded as directly equivalent.

She began by creating microcosms for tadpoles, fish, and insects, and kept a journal of the weather. In high school, she found herself enjoying biology and chemistry courses, and was inspired by Mr. Boehmler, her chemistry teacher, to pursue science.In 1970 she enrolled at Penn State, where she majored in biology. Early in her time there, Fogel took a <b>vocational</b> <b>test</b> which told her that she should never become a nun, sewing machine operator, or religious trainer, but she initially thought she would go on to become a psychiatrist. In those days, women were given different career tests than men. The biology major allowed her to take many electives, where she discovered that she enjoyed environmental science courses. While taking bowling as a PE credit, Fogel found Peter H Given, an organic geochemist who focused on coal science, and worked with him part-time. Her work with Given caused her to miss bowling once a week, and so she received a B in bowling. But, the research helped her decide {{that she wanted to}} be a biogeochemist. Fogel graduated from Penn State in 1973 with a BS in biology with honors. Her research mentor, Given, helped her apply to UT-Austin for graduate school. She decided to take a gap year before starting grad school to travel Europe and start a jewelry business making pins.|$|R
