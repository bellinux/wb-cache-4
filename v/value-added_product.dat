50|$|The human {{sewage and}} the process waste from the {{manufacturing}} industries are the two major sources of the waste water. In Thailand, the total volume of the wastewater from industries {{is much greater than}} that of the domestic sewage. As a result, an effective method is needed. Microbial remediation of xenobiotics has shown to be effective and the low cost technology, but it still has several limitations. Consequently, the genetic engineering approaches are used to create the new strain of microbes (Genetically engineered microorganisms, GEMS) which have better catabolic potential than the wild type species for bioremediation. There are four major approaches to GEM development for the bioremediation application which include the modification of enzyme specificity and affinity, pathway construction and regulation, bioprocess development, monitoring and control and lastly, bio-affinity bio-receptor sensor application for chemical sensing, toxicity reduction and end point analysis. These allow the extensive use of genetically engineered microorganism. In the far future, the genetically engineered microorganisms could possibly be used to control the green house gases, convert the waste to the <b>value-added</b> <b>product</b> as well as to reduce and capture the carbon dioxide gases from the atmosphere (carbon sequestration), but lots of research still need to be done in order to make these potential become true. There is a concern regarding the use of genetically engineered microbes for the remediation of pollutants. Once the genetically microorganisms has been added, it may disperse uncontrollably and hard to be removed. However, the serious majorconcern that leads to the limitation of GEMs development seem to be the lack of information on gene as well as the regulatory constraints.|$|E

Recommended options should lead to simple and safe management alternatives that stress reclamation of resources. This paper addresses sustainability strategies, potential value-added products and enhanced crop yields and quality as a result of biosolids utilization. This paper has denoted designer soils, synthetic coal, turf grass, and activated carbon as potential valueadded products. Data on the application of biosolids to land has noted an increase in yields by as much as 100 % and protein levels exhibited a 30 to 100 % increase.

40|$|Purpose – For {{many farmers}} across the USA the {{opportunity}} to sell their produce directly {{to the public in}} different ways allows them to avoid middle-men and often reap higher benefits that are vital for their survival. However, to what extent do they fully maximise their produce? For instance, do farmers consider developing <b>value-added</b> <b>products</b> when they have fruit or vegetable leftovers, or those with blemishes? The present paper aims to explore involvement in value-added food production from the growers 2 ̆ 7 standpoint. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected via telephone and face-to-face interviews among 30 farm owners located in the state of Alabama. Findings – While the large majority of participating farmers (93. 3 per cent) are involved in selling produce directly to the public, only 33. 3 per cent are currently maximising their produce left-overs, or unsellable produce by developing and marketing <b>value-added</b> <b>products</b> such as jellies, jams and ice-creams. Almost one fourth of farmers (23. 3 per cent) would consider developing <b>value-added</b> <b>products.</b> However, the lack of a commercial kitchen, a potentially considerable investment, is one significant barrier preventing the development of <b>value-added</b> <b>products.</b> Research limitations/implications – Choosing only farmers that are already involved in retailing their own produce, and their low number (30) are limitations that may not allow for making generalisations of the study 2 ̆ 7 s findings. Practical implications – In times where the threat of food crises is latent, the ability for food growers to maximise their harvests becomes critical. Because farm operators {{play a significant role in}} providing food for society at large, they should be accordingly supported to maximise their produce, including through the development of <b>value-added</b> <b>products.</b> Originality/value – The study provides a different view of value-added produce, investigating this dimension from the farmers 2 ̆ 7 viewpoint...|$|R
