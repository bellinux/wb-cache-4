40|$|International audienceAlthough <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> {{response}} time (RT) {{within a particular}} experimental condition are typically ignored, they may sometimes reflect meaningful changes in the efficiency of cognitive and neural processes. In the present study, we investigated whether trial-by-trial <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> {{response time}} (RT) in a cross-modal selective attention task were associated with <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> functional connectivity between brain regions that are thought to underlie attention. Sixteen healthy young adults performed an audiovisual selective attention task, which involved attending to a relevant visual letter while ignoring an irrelevant auditory letter, as we recorded their brain activity using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). In line with predictions, <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> RT were associated with <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and various other brain regions that are posited to underlie attentional control, such as the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral regions of the posterior parietal cortex. They were also linked to <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> functional connectivity between anatomically early and anatomically late regions of the relevant-modality visual cortex whose communication is thought to be modulated by attentional control processes. By revealing that <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> RT in a selective attention task are linked to <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> functional connectivity in the attentional network, the present findings suggest that <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> attention may contribute to trial-by-trial fluctuations of behavioral performance...|$|R
