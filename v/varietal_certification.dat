40|$|AFLP, ISTR, SSR, {{isoenzyme}} {{markers and}} agro-morphological traits were compared {{in terms of}} their polymorphism level, discriminating capability and informativeness among 17 genotypes assembled in the Cuban avocado germoplasm, maintained at Alqu√≠zar {{under the auspices of the}} IIFT (Playa, Havana City, Cuba). D parameter adopted for agro-morphological traits was useful for genotype identification. Only four variables: fruit shape, fruit skin color, harvest season and fruit skin thickness were necessary for distinguishing all the individuals analyzed SSR, AFLP and ISTR were powerful techniques for avocado discriminating and <b>varietal</b> <b>certification,</b> but the high level of polymorphic loci detected by dominant markers highlights the discriminating capacity of these molecular markers. With a single AFLP or ISTR primer combination all the individuals were identified. Also, isoenzymes were a low-cost technique useful for this purpose in local germplasm. The higher values of expected heterozygosity were detected in codominant markers, but the value for microsatellites doubled o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Microsatellites {{are popular}} {{molecular}} markers in many plant species {{due to their}} stable and highly polymorphic nature. A number of analysis methods have been described but analyses of these markers are typically performed on cumbersome polyacrylamide gels or more conveniently by capillary electrophoresis on automated sequencers. However post-PCR handling steps are still required. High resolution melting can now combine detailed sequence analysis with the closed-tube benefits of real-time PCR and is described here as a novel way to verify the identity of plant varieties such as grapevine and olive. Results DNA melting profiles for various plant variety and rootstock samples were compared to profiles for certified reference samples. Two closely related grapevine rootstocks differing by {{as little as a}} single di-nucleotide repeat could be rapidly differentiated while there was high reproducibility of melting profiles for identical cultivars. Conclusion This novel microsatellite analysis method allows high sample throughput with greatly reduced time to results for <b>varietal</b> <b>certification</b> and is amenable to other microsatellite analyses. </p...|$|E
