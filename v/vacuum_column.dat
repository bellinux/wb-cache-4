5000|$|... 1952: Magnetic tape vacuum columnIBM {{introduces}} the {{magnetic tape drive}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>column,</b> {{making it possible for}} fragile magnetic tape to become a viable data storage medium. The use of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>column</b> in the IBM 701 system signals the beginning of the era of magnetic storage, as the technology becomes widely adopted throughout the industry.|$|E
50|$|The {{absolute}} pressure of 10 to 40 mmHg in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>column</b> {{is most often}} achieved by using multiple stages of steam jet ejectors.|$|E
50|$|The later UNISERVO IIA and IIIA omitted {{the plastic}} wear tape and felt wipers, {{since they were}} {{primarily}} used with PET film-base magnetic tape. Both continued the use of single capstan drives and were <b>vacuum</b> <b>column</b> designs. The IIIC and later tapes used NRZI encoding to be compatible with the IBM 729 series tape drives which set the industry standard for data interchange. Ironically, IBM then later switched to phase encoding in its 1600-bit-per-inch tape generation because of its superior data reliability.|$|E

5000|$|Early IBM tape drives, {{such as the}} IBM 727 and IBM 729, were {{mechanically}} sophisticated floor-standing drives {{that used}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>columns</b> to buffer long u-shaped loops of tape. Between active control of powerful reel motors and vacuum control of these u-shaped tape loops, fast start and stop of the tape at the tape-to-head interface could be achieved: 1.5 ms from stopped tape to full speed of 112.5 in/s m/s. The fast acceleration is possible because the tape mass in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>columns</b> is small; the length of tape buffered in the columns provides time to spin the high inertia reels. When active, the two tape reels thus fed tape into or pulled tape out of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>columns,</b> intermittently spinning in rapid, unsynchronized bursts resulting in visually striking action. Stock shots of such vacuum-column tape drives in motion were widely used to represent [...] "the computer" [...] in movies and television.|$|R
50|$|The vacuum {{distillation}} column internals must provide good vapor-liquid contacting while, {{at the same}} time, maintaining a very low pressure increase {{from the top of}} the column top to the bottom. Therefore, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>column</b> uses distillation trays only where withdrawing products from the side of the column (referred to as side draws). Most of the column uses packing material for the vapor-liquid contacting because such packing has a lower pressure drop than distillation trays. This packing material can be either structured sheet metal or randomly dumped packing such as Raschig rings.|$|E
5000|$|Tape motion on many systems was bidirectional, i.e. tape {{could be}} read either forward or {{backward}} {{at the request of}} the controlling computer. Because the supply <b>vacuum</b> <b>column</b> kept a small, constant tension in the reverse direction, the capstan could feed backwards without the tape bunching up or jumping out of path. Unlike most audio tape systems, the capstan and head assemblies were always in contact with the tape, even during fast forward and reverse operations, only moving the head assembly away from the tape path during high-speed rewind. On some units, manufacturers installed a [...] "fast search" [...] capability which could move the tape quickly a certain number of blocks, then bring the tape to a halt and go back to read the requested data at normal speed.|$|E
50|$|The tape {{motion in}} the UNISERVO I was {{controlled}} by a single capstan connected to a synchronous motor. Supply and take-up reel motion was buffered via a complex pulley-string-spring arrangement, as the design was prior to {{the invention of the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>column</b> buffer. The tape drive contained a permanent leader, and each tape reel had a connector link to the leader. The nickel-plated phosphor bronze tapes were very abrasive, and to counter this problem a thin plastic wear tape was slowly moved over the recording head, between the head and the tape, preventing the recording head from quickly wearing out. The metal tapes also were dirty, and a slowly renewed felt wiper collected tape debris. The UNISERVO I had a high-speed rewind capability, and multiple drives on the UNIVAC I could rewind while others continued with data processing reads or writes.|$|E
5000|$|These tape drives were {{mechanically}} sophisticated floor-standing drives {{that used}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>columns</b> to buffer long U-shaped loops of tape. Between active control of powerful reel motors and vacuum control of these U-shaped tape loops, extremely rapid {{start and stop}} of the tape at the tape-to-head interface could be achieved. When active, the two tape reels thus fed tape into or pulled tape out of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>columns,</b> intermittently spinning in rapid, unsynchronized bursts resulting in visually striking action. Stock shots of such vacuum-column tape drives in motion were widely used to represent [...] "the computer" [...] in films and television.|$|R

50|$|In early tape drives, non-continuous data {{transfer}} was normal and unavoidable. Computer processing power and amounts of available memory were usually insufficient {{to provide a}} constant stream, so tape drives were typically designed for so called start-stop operation. Early drives used very large spools, which necessarily had high inertia and did not start and stop moving easily. To provide high start, stop, and seeking performance, several feet of loose tape was played out and pulled by a suction fan down into two deep open channels {{on either side of}} the tape head and capstans. The long thin loops of tape hanging in these <b>vacuum</b> <b>columns</b> had far less inertia than the two reels and could be rapidly started, stopped and repositioned. The large reels would occasionally move to take up written tape and play out more blank tape into the <b>vacuum</b> <b>columns.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{vacuum system}} {{provided}} a physical buffer between the precision {{movements of the}} capstan and the large movements of the reels by storing a short length of tape in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>column</b> under relatively low tension. The vacuum columns were chambers open at one end, the openings being {{in line with the}} tape path before and after the capstan and roller assemblies. The amount of tape in the column was controlled by four optical or vacuum sensors {{on the sides of the}} columns. The control electronics kept the curve of the tape loop between the two inner sensors, cueing the supply reel to feed more or the take-up reel to take more as necessary. The outer two sensors, at the very top and bottom of the columns, served to sense malfunctions in the feed mechanism during operation, prompting the control electronics to shut off all operation of the tape transport and vacuum system to prevent damaging the tape. Because of the tension provided by the vacuum columns and the design of the tape path, tape was usually kept in sufficient contact with the relatively high-friction coating on the capstan that a pinch roller was not used.|$|E
5000|$|There were several, I am remembering about 6, tape drives. But {{the tapes}} {{were not on}} reels. The tape itself was two inches wide and a drive (by engaging/disengaging two {{different}} pressure rollers on capstans) could fairly quickly start the tape moving in either direction. I think there were 12 tracks on the tape, and something like 50 feet of tape on each drive. The tape was pulled from a glass-walled <b>vacuum</b> <b>column</b> on one side to a similar column on the other, and just piled up in the column: Thus {{there was very little}} mass to accelerate or decelerate, mostly the tape itself at the head and for a few feet on either side. As I understood it then the tapes were backup storage to the Williams tubes: One did not dismount a tape and mount another in its place, the way tape was used in later decades. The [...] "fast" [...] Williams tube memory was very limited: I think there were 2K words of high speed storage, each 40 bits. So data and code were shuffled back and forth to tape to make space available.|$|E

50|$|A typical 9-track unit {{consisted}} of a tape transportâ€”essentially all the mechanics that moved tape from reel to reel past the read/write and erase headsâ€”and supporting control and data read/write electronics. The transport typically {{consisted of}} supply motor, take-up motor, hubs for locking the tape reels in place, a capstan motor (though not necessarily a pinch roller, see below), tape head assembly, miscellaneous rollers which kept the tape in a precise path during operation, and <b>vacuum</b> <b>columns</b> which prevented tape 'snatch'. Data could become corrupted by stretched tape or variations in tape speed, so the transport had to guide the tape through without damaging its edges, move it with minimal wow and flutter, {{and give it a}} tension that was low but sufficient to keep the tape in constant contact with the read/write head.|$|R
