50|$|Users {{who wish}} to keep a low profile, can opt for the {{concealed}} display unit sold by Valentine Research directly on their website. Together with hard wiring the device to the vehicle fuse box (which eliminates the traditional power cord throughout the <b>vehicle</b> <b>cabin)</b> a stealth installation is achieved. The main unit still receives and process all signals, but the display is projected in the concealed display mounted discreetly anywhere in the vehicle interior. This helps, especially at night so others {{can not see the}} readout other than the driver. Some users even elect to install a kill switch so they can shut off the device without accessing the main unit. There is also a remote audio kit available that allows connection to headphones or speaker and can turn the main unit on or off as well as having a button that functions like the one on the main unit.The newest feature that can be added to the V1 unit is the V1connection which works with all V1's, but its full capability is available only from V1s with ESP. (Check for the ESP logo on the front panel below the Control Knob.) On pre-ESP V1s, or when using a Pre-ESP Concealed Display or Remote Audio Adapter, your handheld will serve as a wireless remote display of all of V1's front-panel warnings, but other functions and screens are unavailable.|$|E

40|$|Given the {{automotive}} industry 2 ̆ 7 s awareness {{of the importance of}} the perception of NVH emissions, there is an increased focus on the psychoacoustics, or sound quality, of <b>vehicle</b> <b>cabin</b> noise. The present work aims to qualitatively evaluate and compare automobile cabin noise by measuring the road-induced noise and vibration of a driven and motored vehicle. Evaluation of transmission paths and psychoacoustic analysis of the cabin acoustics are primary objectives. A psychoacoustic analysis using the acoustic pressure measurements taken inside the <b>vehicle</b> <b>cabin</b> was performed using both subjective and objective approaches. Testing also included vibration measurements from several structural positions to evaluate vibroacoustic excitations. Using this noise and vibration data, it was possible to evaluate the transfer path of the excitation energy into the <b>vehicle</b> <b>cabin.</b> Further, an attempt to establish a correlation between the noise and vibration measurements and the psychoacoustic observations was also proven possible with some inherent limitations...|$|E

50|$|Another feature seen are tapered rails that narrow {{vertically}} and/or horizontally {{in front}} of a <b>vehicle's</b> <b>cabin.</b> This is done mainly on trucks to save weight and slightly increase room for the engine since the front of the vehicle does not bear as much of a load as the back. Design developments include frames that use more than one shape in the same frame rail. For example, some pickup trucks have a boxed frame {{in front of}} the cab, shorter, narrower rails underneath the cab, and regular C-rails under the bed.|$|R

40|$|AbstractVehicles are the people's main {{means of}} {{transportation}} and thermal comfort in the <b>vehicle</b> <b>cabin</b> plays an important role. The heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) operation system in the <b>vehicle</b> <b>cabin</b> decides the degree of comfort, traffic safety as well as health of the occupants. The challenge of designing the HVAC control is to automatically achieve the thermal comfort, regardless of time varying weather conditions. Since most HVAC systems are complex with nonlinearity, distributed parameters, and multivariable therefore many classical controls do not necessarily yield a satisfactory control performance. This paper presents the development of temperature and humidity control strategy for HVAC based on Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC). The goal of the FLC-based temperature control is to satisfy the convergence and equilibrium property. The simulation test results have been shown a satisfactory to control the temperature and humidity...|$|E

These two vehicle styles were used because B-pillars on four-door models are farther forward, and thus nearer the fore-aft position of the driver. (Furthermore, the B-pillars on two-door models can be narrower, and some two-door models have no B-pillars at all.) To control for driver differences between these two body styles, going-straight-ahead crashes were used for comparison. The analysis used 2000 - 2003 North Carolina crash data, and considered the crash experience of four-door and two-door body styles for the same 10 vehicles for model years 1995 and newer. The main finding is that four-door body styles {{are more likely to}} be involved in lanechange crashes than are two-door body styles of the same vehicle models.
