50|$|The {{original}} corporation {{was founded}} in Bridgeport, Connecticut and started selling its machines in 1938. It became famous in the following decades for these small- and medium-sized <b>vertical</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines,</b> with their iconic form of a quill-equipped multiple-speed <b>vertical</b> <b>milling</b> head with a ram-on-turret mounting over a knee-and-column base. The American Precision Museum's biography of Rudolph Bannow reports that he conceived the iconic design in 1936 as the logical machine on which to mount the milling head already being built by the Bridgeport Pattern and Model Works (which he owned with partner Magnus Wahlstrom).

5000|$|Van Norman {{was most}} noted for their [...] "ram type" [...] milling machines, which {{due to their}} {{swiveling}} head design could be converted quickly and easily from horizontal to vertical spindles.

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines usage in the manufacturing field appears {{to suggest that they}} are expected to be in good running condition. Machine tools such as CNC <b>vertical</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> are meant to produce precise work parts. Motion errors are factors which can directly affect the accuracy of the machine. This study presents an opportunity for interested parties to understand the characteristics of motion errors that exist in the CNC <b>vertical</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> with different feed rate settings. The purpose of this project is to find out any abnormalities apparent to the machine performance as the feed rate setting is increased. The motion errors of the CNC machines were examined by using a measuring device, namely Double Ball Bar (DBB). This equipment is designed to examine machine performance by measuring the accuracy of its movements. This device, which has two balls of identical size {{at the end of the}} bar, was mounted on a spindle and onto a special holder which is mounted on the working table. The machine is programmed to move in a circular motion, clockwise and anti-clockwise in three planes, XY, YZ and ZX. Any deviation from the standard data will represent the imperfection of the machines condition, especially mechanical components such as the slide bearing, spindle bearing or servo motor responses. By knowing the most significant error origin, the corrective countermeasures can then be carried out...|$|R

50|$|The {{wire-cut}} type {{of machine}} {{arose in the}} 1960s {{for the purpose of}} making tools (dies) from hardened steel. The tool electrode in wire EDM is simply a wire. To avoid the erosion of material from the wire causing it to break, the wire is wound between two spools so that the active part of the wire is constantly changing. The earliest numerical controlled (NC) machines were conversions of punched-tape <b>vertical</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines.</b> The first commercially available NC machine built as a wire-cut EDM machine was manufactured in the USSR in 1967. Machines that could optically follow lines on a master drawing were developed by David H. Dulebohn's group in the 1960s at Andrew Engineering Company for <b>milling</b> and grinding <b>machines.</b> Master drawings were later produced by computer numerical controlled (CNC) plotters for greater accuracy. A wire-cut EDM machine using the CNC drawing plotter and optical line follower techniques was produced in 1974. Dulebohn later used the same plotter CNC program to directly control the EDM machine, and the first CNC EDM machine was produced in 1976.|$|R
30|$|In {{spite of}} above works, very few works {{are found in}} {{literature}} dealing with the optimal process parameter selection based on simultaneously minimization of tool vibration amplitudes during cutting as well as surface roughness average values of the workpiece. The milling experiments are conducted on the CNC <b>vertical</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machining</b> centre by considering three levels of feed rate, spindle speed and axial depth of cut. Using the response surface methodology with Box-Behnken design, a mathematical model is developed to predict the surface roughness and amplitude of tool vibration levels {{in terms of the}} cutting process variables. Using the experimental data, neural network model is created to approximate the relationship between the three process parameters and two output variables. Furthermore, the equations obtained from response surface methodology are employed as function-estimators for GA-based optimization module, which attempts to minimize simultaneously the tool vibration amplitude and average roughness. The resulting optimum process parameters are reported and discussions are made. Thus, data generation, interaction of responses, implementation of multi-objective genetic algorithms, parallel radial basis neural network modelling for comparison of results is explained one after the other.|$|R

The confinement of the plasma occurs inside a cylinder in the rocket, caused by the magnetic field generated by a high power magnetic coil.

40|$|Purpose - Therefore, {{the purpose}} of this study is to {{understand}} the relationships between the processing parameters and the geometric form of the produced single tracks, in order to control dimensional quality in future experimentations. The quality of the deposited single track and layer is of prime importance in the selective laser melting (SLM) process, as it affects the product quality in terms of dimensional precision and product performance. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, a <b>vertical</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machining</b> center equipped with an Ytterbium-fiber laser was used in the SLM experimentation to form single cobalt-chromium-molybdenum (CoCrMo) tracks. The different geometric features and the influence of the scanning parameters on these morphologic characteristics were studied statistically by means of ANOVA. Findings - Evidently, track height (h 1) inaccuracy reduced in layer thicknesses between 100 and 200 μm. The re-melt depth (h 2) was determined by the energy parameters, with laser power of 325 - 350 W and scanning speed (SS) of 66. 6 - 83. 3 mm/s being the most favorable parameters to obtain the required anchoring. Moreover, a contact angle of 117 ° was proposed as optimal, as it permitted an adequate overlapping region and a full densification, and, finally, an SS of 50 mm/s and a layer thickness of 250 were suggested for its development. Originality/value - The comprehension of the phenomena inherent to the process is related to the single track geometrical characteristics, which allow the definition of an optimal value for each factor for a further proposal of processing conditions that can finally derive a higher precision, wetting, density and mechanical propertiesThe authors gratefully appreciate the financial supports from the Spanish Government (project DPI 2009 - 09852) and the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7 -PEOPLE- 2009) under the grant agreement IRSES n° 247476 that lead to these research result...|$|R
