5|$|In {{order to}} resolve {{the problem of the}} {{excessive}} growth of phumdis that affects the lake ecosystem and local community, a study sponsored by the IndiaCanada Environment Facility was undertaken by the Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) to examine efficient ways of converting phumdis into briquettes as fodder and fuel pellets, which could be used to meet both energy demands within the region. Two options for the biomass conversion were studied. The first involved making briquettes of <b>vegetative</b> <b>part</b> of phumdis for use as fodder while the second proposed to pelletise the lower part of phumdis for use as fuel. The study observed that phumdis have nutritional potential as feed material due to its higher crude fibre and crude protein content, but the inorganic content in the root and mat zone was found to be unsuitable for the purpose. The second option of making briquettes from the upper vegetative portion of the phumdis by mixing 12% de-oiled rice bran was found to be feasible for using them as fodder. The lower portion, which was densified to make fuel pellets, was found to be suitable for use as fuel. Such pellets were found to have an average calorific value of 3,400calories per kilogram (14,200kJ/kg) with ash content of 27%. Cost economics were worked out and the study had found it to be “an economically viable and an attractive proposition for the benefit of local population.” The study concluded that extraction of phumdi from the lake could also generate income for the local people who are dependent on the lake for their livelihood. Such a step would protect the lake from the adverse effects of proliferation of phumdis and maintain the ecological balance of the lake, thus converting the waste into wealth. The Planning Commission has also concurred with project proposals to engage interested individuals and private enterprises to begin the commercial venture of manufacturing compost from the phumdis and thus improve the environment of the Keibul Lamjao National Park. The project also envisages removal of 3630 artificial phumdis and compensation to their owners; this is reported to have been implemented.|$|E

Based on the results of this Chapter, 7 plant species were selected for further studies. In the second and in the third chapters these 7 species were used in two experiments to assess their palatability when used alone or mixed with other concentrates. Based on the results of these studies, one plant was discarded and 5 plants were used in a productive short term experiment. Indeed, the fourth chapter deals with the experiments carried out on lactating ewes in order {{to evaluate the}} intake of the mixes including the plants, and the effects on milk production and composition, health status of the animals, and rumen function. Based on the results of the short term productive experiment, 3 plants were considered superior: Carum carvi, Coriandrum sativum and Satureja Montana. These plants need to further studies to asses their productive and health effects when used in long term studies and to assess their ability to transfer active microbial compounds to the milk and the cheese. </br...|$|R

5000|$|Mycelium is the <b>vegetative</b> <b>part</b> of {{a fungus}} or fungus-like {{bacterial}} colony, {{consisting of a}} mass of branching, thread-like hyphae. The mass of hyphae is sometimes called shiro, especially within the fairy ring fungi. Fungal colonies composed of mycelium are found in and on soil and many other substrates. A typical single spore germinates into a homokaryotic mycelium, which cannot reproduce sexually; when two compatible homokaryotic mycelia join and form a dikaryotic mycelium, that mycelium may form fruiting bodies such as mushrooms. A mycelium may be minute, forming a colony that {{is too small to}} see, or it may be extensive: Is this the largest organism in the world? This site in eastern Oregon had a contiguous growth of mycelium before logging roads cut through it. Estimated at 1,665 football fields in size and 2,200 years old, this one fungus has killed the forest above it several times over, and in so doing has built deeper soil layers that allow the growth of ever-larger stands of trees. Mushroom-forming forest fungi are unique in that their mycelial mats can achieve such massive proportions. Paul Stamets, Mycelium Running ...|$|E
