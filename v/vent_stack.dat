Adding a vent connection within the run will aid flow, and when used with a cleanout allows for better serviceability of the long run.|$|E

The incident occurred when the plant entered the ‘start up’ phase after the completion of a five-yearly maintenance overhaul. The “High Temperature Shift catalyst began the process of ‘reduction’” where steam passes through the catalyst bed and out the SP8 <b>vent</b> <b>stack.</b> At this time lower temperatures in parts of the plant caused some of the steam to condense lower which caused chromium(VI) from the catalyst bed to dissolve into the liquid present. The amount of condensate overwhelmed the drainage arrangements resulting in the emission of condensate through the SP8 <b>vent</b> <b>stack.</b> The leak went undetected for 30-minutes releasing 200 kg of chromium(VI) into the atmosphere exposing up to 20 workers at the plant and 70 nearby homes in Stockton.|$|E

5000|$|The boilers {{in these}} {{class of ships}} were unique in that they were dual-fueled. As on any other steam ship, the boilers {{operated}} on fuel oil; usually Bunker-C. Steam powered LNG carriers however, also burn natural gas. As the cargo tanks absorbed heat from the sea, {{a portion of the}} cryogenic LNG cargo boils off, changing from a liquid to a vapor (gas). As a result, pressure within the cargo tanks increases; similar to boiling water in a pressure cooker. To prevent rupturing the thin Invar tank material, pressure is controlled by venting the natural gas evaporate. Natural gas is either released to the atmosphere via <b>vent</b> <b>stacks</b> located above the cargo tanks or compressed and piped to the ship's boilers, which are designed to operate simultaneously on natural gas and fuel oil.|$|R

50|$|Ventilation stacks are {{implemented}} {{on the north}} and south façades of the building. These stacks are used to channel air.

50|$|Maintaining {{the water}} seal is {{critical}} to trap operation; traps can and do dry out, and poor venting can suction or blow {{water out of the}} traps.

Plumbing codes usually provide strict limitations on how far a trap may be located from the nearest <b>vent</b> <b>stack.</b>|$|E
50|$|Phase 3 was {{announced}} in May 2007 to increase storage, ship unloading and vapourisation capabilities. A fourth 190,000 m3 LNG storage tank was constructed {{to the east of}} the three existing tanks. A second jetty (Jetty No. 8) was constructed on the River Medway (after demolition of the former jetty 8) together with an associated cryogenic pipeline to the existing transfer pipeline. The jetty has three 16-inch loading arms and a 16-inch vapour return arm. The jetty is capable of handling LNG tankers of 125,000 to 266,000 m3 cargo capacity (QMax). The 36-inch diameter 4.5 km nickel-steel pipeline has a flexible polyurethane (PUR) foam insulation in a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) casing, the line transfers LNG between the jetty and the storage sites. There is also a 14-inch recirculation line. Additional facilities included further submerged combustion vapourisers; boil-off gas compressors; nitrogen facilities; and a <b>vent</b> <b>stack.</b> The development provided an additional five million tonnes of capacity per annum. All this capacity was contracted out from December 2010. Customers included BP, Iberdrola, Sonatrach, Centrica, E.ON and GDF Suez.|$|E

Jeff's main criticisms largely resulted in the choice of the flat roof, which Jill compared to a deck - its almost nonexistent slope, despite the steel roofing, meant that puddles could still easily form on the roof, compromising the shed's structure.|$|E
40|$|Mechanical seals for {{rotating}} equipment in various process industries represent a potential source for fugitive emissions, and accordingly this category of equipment is destined for increas-ingly close scrutiny. For the pharmaceutical industry, the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments {{and the impact}} of resultant regulations will have a direct effect on the selection and operation of {{rotating equipment}} and sealing devices. This article summarizes the proposed regulations, reviews the results of recent emissions surveys, discusses current sealing technology, and outlines a recommended strategy for developing an effec-, tive fugitive emissions control program for rotary equipment used in pharmaceutical manufacturing. E ach year in the United States, an estimated 385, 000 tons of emissions from fugitive sources (pumps, valves, etc.) contaminate the environment (I).

40|$|Residents of Studebaker Halls and the Ball State Mobile Home Courts {{living near}} Cardinal Creek have complained about {{offensive}} odors {{coming from the}} creek, from time to time, during the last several years. Complaints have also been made about the general "unsightliness" of the stream. Ball State officials, however, have maintained that the stream {{has never been the}} source of the offensive odors about which residents have complained. One explanation of the odors given by the University has been that high temperatures and humidity prevent the diffusion of sewer gas from trailer <b>vent</b> <b>stacks.</b> This sewer gas would then settle in low areas much like smog over a large city. 1. Because the investigator was a resident in the Studebaker complex during the summer of 1966, and because of interest in Limnology stimulated by Dr. Miller and Dr. Hibbs that same summer, the investigator proceeded to plan a limited chemical and biological study of Cardinal Creek to determine the general health of the stream on the Ball State campus.

5000|$|Point leader Jacques Villeneuve {{set a new}} {{track record}} in qualifying; the eight such {{occurrence}} of the season. Al Unser Jr., starting in Row 4, came in during the parade laps with a flat tire. At the start Americans Eddie Cheever and Scott Pruett touched wheels and collected compatriot Parker Johnstone, who spun off in Turn 4 (the starts at Mid-Ohio {{take place on the}} backstretch, just after Turn 3). Johnstone's day was over before it started. A few laps later, Brazilians Raul Boesel and Andre Ribeiro received stop and go penalties for overtaking under the Turn 4 yellow, the site of Johnstone's accident. Through the first 20 laps only Michael Andretti could match the pace of polesitter Villeneuve, both men several seconds ahead of third placed Maurício Gugelmin. By this time, however, the wicker on Andretti's rear wing came loose, and ultimately {{the left side of the}} wicker flew off. But Andretti stayed on Villeneuve, apparently unaffected by the [...] "wing change". Little Al made his first pit stop oat Lap 23, a bit earlier than the leaders who were negotiating traffic. Pay drivers Hiro Matsushita, Eliseo Salazar, and Carlos Guerrero were not easy for Jacques and Michael to overtake. The duo pitted on Lap 29, with no position change, but Michael made a dramatic pass in Turn 7 (a part of the esses, or the [...] "twisty bits", as they are also called at Mid-Ohio) to take the spot. The pass was not for the lead, however, because rookie Gil de Ferran stayed out for a few more laps on a light fuel load. De Ferran went from 5th to 3rd after his pit stops completed the first round of stops. Soon after pit stops second place Villeneuve reported braking problems, which was later diagnosed as a boiling problem on a very warm and humid day. Rookie Andre Ribeiro was soon very warm when he brought the Tasman car into the pits unscheduled; a fire developed in the rear of the car when the fuel <b>vent</b> <b>stack</b> stuck open allowing fuel to gush out and ignite on the exhaust. De Ferran took second from Villeneuve whose pace had slowed due to concern over the brakes. On Lap 39 Bobby Rahal, the crowd favorite who had moved up from 8th to 4th in the pit stops, tried Villeneuve on the outside of Turn 5. They touched wheels and Rahal was sent into the wall. Neither he nor the crowd were pleased with Villeneuve, who was given enough room according to Rahal. Al Unser Jr., off sequence with the leaders, pitted under the full course yellow.|$|E
40|$|The aircraft-based Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) is a {{platform}} for multiple infrared astronomical observation experiments. These experiments carry sensors cooled to liquid helium temperatures. The liquid helium supply is contained in large (i. e., 10 liters or more) vacuum-insulated dewars. Should the dewar vacuum insulation fail, the inrushing air will condense and freeze on the dewar wall, resulting in a large heat flux on the dewar's contents. The heat flux results in a rise in pressure and the actuation of the dewar pressure relief system. A previous NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) assessment provided recommendations for the wall heat flux that would be expected from a loss of vacuum and detailed an appropriate method to use in calculating the maximum pressure that would occur {{in a loss of}} vacuum event. This method involved building a detailed supercritical helium compressible flow thermal/fluid model of the <b>vent</b> <b>stack</b> and exercising the model over the appropriate range of parameters. The experimenters designing science instruments for SOFIA are not experts in compressible supercritical flows and do not generally have access to the thermal/fluid modeling packages that are required to build detailed models of the vent stacks. Therefore, the SOFIA Program engaged the NESC to develop a simplified methodology to estimate the maximum pressure in a liquid helium dewar after the loss of vacuum insulation. The method would allow the university-based science instrument development teams to conservatively determine the cryostat's vent neck sizing during preliminary design of new SOFIA Science Instruments. This report details the development of the simplified method, the method itself, and the limits of its applicability. The simplified methodology provides an estimate of the dewar pressure after a loss of vacuum insulation {{that can be used for}} the initial design of the liquid helium dewar vent stacks. However, since it is not an exact tool, final verification of the dewar pressure vessel design requires a complete, detailed real fluid compressible flow model of the <b>vent</b> <b>stack.</b> The wall heat flux resulting from a loss of vacuum insulation increases the dewar pressure, which actuates the pressure relief mechanism and results in high-speed flow through the dewar <b>vent</b> <b>stack.</b> At high pressures, the flow can be choked at the <b>vent</b> <b>stack</b> inlet, at the exit, or at an intermediate transition or restriction. During previous SOFIA analyses, it was observed that there was generally a readily identifiable section of the <b>vent</b> <b>stack</b> that would limit the flow e. g., a small diameter entrance or an orifice. It was also found that when the supercritical helium was approximated as an ideal gas at the dewar condition, the calculated mass flow rate based on choking at the limiting entrance or transition was less than the mass flow rate calculated using the detailed real fluid model 2. Using this lower mass flow rate would yield a conservative prediction of the dewars wall heat flux capability. The simplified method of the current work was developed by building on this observation...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the air {{pressure}} variations in an in-use drainage stack of high-rise residential buildings with the probable influence of occupant loads. Design/methodology/approach - The air pressure variations in a drainage stack of a typical in-use high-rise residential building in Hong Kong were correlated to the number of water closet (WC) flushes of the building. In particular, measured diurnal WC flushing patterns of the residential buildings were used to correlate the diurnal pressure variations measured at 16 m above the stack base in a 115 m high, 150 mm diameter fully <b>vented</b> drainage <b>stack</b> of a typical high-rise residential building of Hong Kong. Findings - The occurrence of the maximum air pressure in the stack could be correlated with the expected hourly WC flushes of the high-rise residential buildings with mathematical demonstrations. Research limitations/implications - There may be high speed transients in the stack (> 1 hertz) which was not measured. Originality/value - The result would be a useful source of reference for the development of control strategies against probable appliance seal loss in high-rise residential buildings.

40|$|Two errors {{have been}} {{identified}} in the authorization basis for the 242 -A Evaporator at the Hanford Site. These errors, which appear in the 242 -A Evaporator/Crystallizer Final Safety Analysis Report analysis of ammonia gas concentrations accidentally released from the 242 -A Evaporator, are: (1) the vessel ventilation system flow rate used in the previous calculations is a factor of ten higher than the actual flow rate, and (2) the previous calculations did not account for the ammonia source term reduction that would occur via condensation of ammonia vapors, which will remove a large fraction of the ammonia from the exhaust gas stream. The purpose of this document is to correct these errors and recalculate the maximum ground-level concentrations of ammonia released to the environment as a result of potential errors in blending Evaporator feed. The errors offset each other somewhat, so {{it is unlikely that the}} 242 -A Evaporator has operated outside its current authorization basis. However, the errors must be corrected and the results incorporated into a revision of the 242 -A Evaporator/Crystallizer Safety Analysis Report, WHC-SD-WM-SAR- 023. An EPA-approved atmospheric dispersion model, SCREEN 3, was used to recalculate the maximum ground-level concentrations of ammonia that would be released from the 242 -A Evaporator as a result of a feed-blending error.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Naturally {{ventilated}} buildings {{often include}} large stack structures {{to assist the}} ventilation flow. The benefit of such stacks lies in the additional buoyancy force that they produce to drive the flow in still conditions. They also provide additional draw in windy conditions if the dampers are appropriately designed. In some situations, for example with a sloping roof, the geometry of the building restricts {{the location of the}} stack to lie below the uppermost point of the building. This reduces the efficiency of the stack, and depending on the detailed flow path to the stack, it may even lead to flow reversal in the stack. Here we describe the implications of such effects on the effective design of stacks. The modelling is presented {{in the context of a}} school which is presently under construction and for which there is a sloping roof, with <b>stacks</b> <b>venting</b> from the classrooms at mid-wall height...|$|R
40|$|A millimeter-wave (mm-wave) sensor in the {{frequency}} range of 225 - 315 GHz is being developed for continuous emission monitoring of airborne effluents from industrial sites for environmental compliance monitoring and process control. Detection of chemical species is based on measuring the molecular rotational energy transitions at mm-wave frequencies. The mm-wave technique offers better transmission properties compared to optics in harsh industrial environments with smoke, dust, aerosols, and steam, {{as well as in}} adverse atmospheric conditions. The laboratory measurements indicate that polar molecules can be measured with a sensitivity of tens of parts-per-million-meter using this technology. Proof of principle of the open-path system was tested by releasing and detecting innocuous chemicals in the open air. It uses a monostatic radar configuration with transmitter and receiver {{on one side and a}} comer cube on tire other side of the plume to be measured. A wide-band swept frequency mm-wave signal is transmitted through the plume and return signal from the comer cube is detected by a hot-electron-bolometer. Absorption spectra of plume gases are measured by comparing the return signals with and without the plume in the beam path. Using signal processing based on deconvolution, high specificity of detection has been shown for resolving individual chemicals from a mixture.
