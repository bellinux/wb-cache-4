An image, represented as sequence of featurevectors characterizing low-level visual features such as color, texture or orientededges, is modeled as having been stochastically generated by a hidden Markov model, whose states represent concepts.

40|$|Abstract. Ontologies play a {{key role}} in agent {{communication}} and the emerging Semantic Web to define a <b>vocabulary</b> <b>of</b> <b>concepts</b> and their relationships. Different agents and web services may use vocabularies from different ontologies to describe their data. The current research on ontology mapping and ontology translation mainly focuses on how to map and translate vocabularies and associated data instances from one ontology to another. However, more complicated true statements, such as axioms (rules), are used or being developed to describe the relationships among the concepts. When extending one ontology using complicated true statements (theory) from another, we must confront the problem of theory translation, which is difficult because of the asymmetry of translation. In this paper, using an inferential approach we call axiom derivation, we show how to translate complex axioms between different time ontologies. We also prove the validity of our algorithm. ...|$|E

40|$|While {{wearable}} {{cameras are}} becoming increasingly popular, locating relevant information in large unstructured collections of egocentric images is still a tedious and time consuming process. This paper addresses the problem of organizing egocentric photo streams acquired by a wearable camera into semantically meaningful segments, hence making an important step towards the goal of automatically annotating these photos for browsing and retrieval. In the proposed method, first, contextual and semantic information is extracted for each image by employing a Convolutional Neural Networks approach. Later, a <b>vocabulary</b> <b>of</b> <b>concepts</b> is defined in a semantic space by relying on linguistic information. Finally, by exploiting the temporal coherence of concepts in photo streams, images which share contextual and semantic attributes are grouped together. The resulting temporal segmentation is particularly suited for further analysis, ranging from event recognition to semantic indexing and summarization. Experimental results over egocentric set of nearly 31, 000 images, show the prominence of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc...|$|E

Quality of service (QoS) plays an important role to resolve the issue of best service among the functional similar services.

This is why; the success of semantic web depends on the proliferation of ontologies. Depending on the nature of the application, different companies may use different ontology languages and QoS models for web services selection which lead to the issue of heterogeneity. In this paper we have presented ontology evaluation criteria that if satisfied, can solve the problem of heterogeneity and interoperability. Moreover, ontology developers may also use these criteria to evaluate their developed ontology for the refinements. We have evaluated different ontologies in-order to know their strengths and limitations along with the new research directions...|$|E

These concepts can be extended and readily used by the semantic web applications in order to share resources among different institutions...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{reviews and}} argues for the {{importance}} of insights from the trans-disciplinary ‘complexity theory ’ for Sociology. Complexity theory addresses issues that {{lie at the heart of}} classic Sociological theory. These include: the tension between general theory and explanation of specific phenomena; emergence, that is, the relationship between micro- and macro-levels of analysis; and the concept of system. In particular, it is argued that Sociology has much to benefit from the new thinking about the concept of system that has taken place within complexity theory. In an era of globalisation, Sociology needs to develop its <b>vocabulary</b> <b>of</b> <b>concepts</b> in order to address large scale, systemic phenomena. Special attention is paid to the application of specific concepts from complexity theory to social phenomena, including: co-evolution of complex adaptive systems, fitness landscapes, and path dependency. The implications for Sociology of distinctions and differences within complexity theory, especially those between the Santa Fe and Prigogine approaches, are addressed. While the focus of the paper is on the theoretical issues, the example of globalisation is used to illuminate the analysis, especially in relation to the changing nature of polities and their interrelationships...|$|E
