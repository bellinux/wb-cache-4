Careful planning and production methods enabled a <b>very</b> <b>quick</b> completion time of 6 months; the game was finished before even acquiring a distribution partner. Grin used TQM methods to ensure a high standard of work, and JIT techniques to ensure the timing of different production phases came together.|$|E
5|$|Hoffman {{notes that}} A Free Ride {{contains}} many fundamental constituents {{which are the}} characteristics of an archetypal pornographic film. He identifies these basic constituents as a carefully planned but not complicated state of affairs to provide introductory motivation, visual stimuli to sexually excite the women, a theme that is generally rare in reality, a straightforward and <b>very</b> <b>quick</b> seduction, and the sex acts as the film's central theme.|$|E
5|$|Giro {{champion}} Denis Menchov was {{the last}} man to take the course. The rain started again as he and Di Luca were the last ones on course. He was on pace to win the stage, but he dramatically crashed in the final kilometer, with his bike skidding well {{out in front of}} him on the wet cobbles. Support staff from his team car gave him a <b>very</b> <b>quick</b> bike change and he was back up in moments, finishing 24 seconds back on the stage to preserve his overall victory in the Giro.|$|E

Once the feature vector is extracted, we comparing it with the feature vector of face which is authenticated, and we calculated the error rates in {{the two sets of}} validation and test for the data base XM 2 VTS according to the protocol of Lausanne. The experimental results indicate the reliability, feasibility and efficacy of the proposed method. Moreover, compared to PCA, LDA and EFM, the proposed technique is <b>very</b> <b>quicker</b> to compute.

5|$|In 1998, {{the club}} was {{purchased}} by London Clubs, who moved their premises from the Devonshire Club on St James's Street to {{the basement of the}} Ritz. A new company was formed in June 1998, the Ritz Hotel Casino Ltd., which was granted legal permission to open a casino. After <b>very</b> <b>quick</b> refurbishment, it reopened on 12 September with exclusive membership, although members are permitted to invite a guest. As of 2006 the Ritz Club was divided into four main areas—the restaurant, bar, lounge and the private gaming room, situated in the former Banqueting Hall. In July 2014, London High Court heard a case against the club, in which Nora Al-Daher claimed she was 'taken advantage' of and asked for £2 million in losses.|$|E
5|$|In her summation, however, Karros manages an {{effective}} damage control, pointing {{out to the}} jury that the case in question was not the past record of Varrick but solely the effects of Krayoxx, and that Finley & Figg has in no way proven a connection between Krayoxx {{and the death of}} their client's late husband. The jury is convinced and renders a <b>very</b> <b>quick</b> verdict totally rejecting the Krayoxx tort claim and giving Varrick their expected vindication. Still, Zinc's former colleagues of Rogan Rothberg express their grudging respect for his spirited cross-examination, and even help Zinc get even with an obnoxious blogger who had been ceaselessly maligning Zinc and Zinc's wife. Moreover, Karros keeps her promise and agrees to drop all the frivolous lawsuit and legal malpractice proceedings against Finley & Figg. Varrick has no special grudge against this small firm, though they intend to settle accounts with their old foe Alisandros and extract from him big sums on a frivolous lawsuit.|$|E

Marcelo and Carvajal are also <b>very</b> <b>quick</b> full backs and so can get forward on the break too and put crosses in the box during attack, while being able to track back quick enough.|$|E
