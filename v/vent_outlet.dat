Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) and Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Moulding (VARTM) have established themselves as the two main LCM options. In this thesis, a Finite Difference Method (FDM) approach is developed and implemented for predicting the flow of resin during the filling stage of RTM and VARTM. For RTM filling simulation, the discretized partial differential equations are stored in a matrix and solved using a standard numerical solution approach of Lower-Upper Decomposition. For VARTM filling simulation, solutions are obtained using an iterative method.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} a current Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in protecting health-care workers (HCWs) from airborne-infection (AI) exposure, and compares HCW AI exposures within an AIIR and a traditional patient room. We numerically simulated the air-flow patterns in the rooms, using room geometries and layout (room dimensions, bathroom dimensions and details, placement of vents and furniture), ventilation parameters (flow rates at the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>vents,</b> diffuser design, thermal sources, etc.), and pressurization corresponding to those measured at a local hospital. A patient-cough was introduced into each simulation, and the AI dispersal was tracked in time using a multi-phase flow simulation approach. The measured data showed that ventilation rates for both rooms exceeded 12 air-changes per hour (ACH), and the AIIR was at almost 16 ACH. Thus, the AIIR met the recommended design criteria for ventilation rate and pressurization. However, the computed results revealed incomplete air mixing, and not all of the room air was changed 12 (or 16) times per hour. In fact, in some regions of the room, the air merely circulated, and did not refresh. With the main exhaust flow rate exceeding the main supply, mass flow rate conservation required a part of the deficit to be accounted for by air migration from the corridor through the gaps around the main door. Hence, the AIIR was effective in containing the "infectious aerosol" within the room. However, it showed increased exposure of the HCW to the AI pathogens, as the flow from the ceiling-mounted supply louver first encountered the patient and then the HCW almost directly {{on its way to the}} main exhaust, also located on the ceiling. The traditional patient room exhibited a similar flow path. In addition, for the traditional patient room, some cough-generated aerosol is observed very close to the gaps around the door to the corridor, indicating that the aerosol may escape to the corridor, and spread the infection beyond the room. The computational results suggest that ventilation arrangement can have an important role in better protecting the HCW from exposure to airborne infectious pathogens.

40|$|A {{review on}} {{nosocomial}} infection {{has shown that}} there are various compelling {{evidence to suggest that}} the role of the airborne route to infection in a multi-bed environment cannot be ignored. Expiratory activities such as coughing, sneezes, talking and patient-centric activities such as bed-making has been shown in literature to generate significant quantity of infectious quanta that may become airborne and pose an infection threat to vulnerable patients. In this study, an airborne infection route of MRSA in the health care environment has been investigated using both the large-eddy simulation (LES) technique and an infection modeling. From analyzing flow field regimes in both a single room (typically found in isolation wards) and multi-bed ward environments, it was observed that the supply air delivered into the ventilated space produces pockets of recirculation areas near the walls and midway of the room {{in the wake of the}} advancing ventilation outlet bound flows, after impinging on internal surfaces such as beds. These recirculation areas have been identified as hot spots for possible airborne infection. Furthermore, the results suggests that the further the <b>outlet</b> <b>vent</b> is away from the inlet vent, the more likely will be the generation of recirculation regions, which directly translate to poor ventilation spots and that the use of curtains within the vicinity of the aerosol generating activities increases the number of recirculation areas. The overall airflow analysis suggest that any engineering solution designed to limit or remove the recirculation regions from the flow regime will be an effective way of fighting cross infections within the hospital ward environment, and as such ventilation schemes that are optimally designed to achieve this should be encouraged and investigated. This study has also predicted the possibility of a secondary infection in a multiward environment using various modeling approaches. The results obtained indicated that the posture of an infected person involved in the release of pathogens in relation to cohorts can have a profound effect on infection rates within the ward environment. The study of the coughing episode with the patient lying on the side generated a unit secondary infection, whilst the same simulated episode with an adjacent curtain in position failed to generate a secondary infection within the exposure period. The activity of bed making was also found to generate a secondary infection over the duration of the simulation, suggesting that bed-making can be a potential source of infection. The particle concentration decay curves examined in this work equally suggest that patients are at their most vulnerable state at the initial stages of coughing/sneezes, and talking episodes where the infecting patient assumes a directly facing posture to the susceptible...|$|R
40|$|Modern day airliners are {{subjected}} {{to a wide range}} of environmental conditions when operational across the globe. In order to ensure reliable aircraft performance and avoid thermal failure of heat sensitive components, consideration must be given to the wide range of temperatures that the aircraft will encounter when designing aircraft internal enclosures. This thesis presents an investigation into the fluid flow and heat transfer within an aircraft wing leading edge compartment due to solar loading and the presence of an internal bleed duct. A detailed experimental investigation into the thermal distribution, bleed duct heat transfer and flow structure was performed for 1 105 < Grasho f No: < 4 105 in a representative wing leading edge enclosure constructed for this purpose. Temperature measurements were recorded along the interior surfaces along with the internal air temperature in the cavity. Particle Image Velocimetery (PIV) was used to quantify the flowfield present in the leading edge. There were three main aspects to this thesis: The first was to characterise the enclosure conditions and bleed duct heat transfer within the sealed leading edge. This was performed firstly to gain an understanding of the heat transfer characteristics within the leading edge and secondly to use as a comparison for when ventilation was introduced. It was observed that the confining effect of the enclosure was only evident at the higher Gr range investigated, with the initial heat transfer similar to that of an unconfined cylinder. The interior temperature distribution was also dependent upon Gr, with the plume mixing effect creating a more homogeneous air temperature as Gr increased. The effect of enclosure ventilation was also considered with a view to helping reduce a thermally aggressive environment which can be present in a hot ambient environment. The placement of the ventilation openings was limited due to the geometric constraints of the leading edge, yet a 77 % increase in the bleed duct heat transfer was observed for a dual vent opening configuration. Geometrical effects within the leading edge were investigated in order to appreciate their influence on heat transfer and ventilation. Partitioning of the leading edge (due to a front sub-spar) produced a blockage between the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>vent</b> which reduced the bleed duct heat transfer. Interior temperature and flowfield were also observed to be dependent upon the bleed duct position, as its buoyant plume was the main driver of the flow structure within. The effect of a larger, constant temperature cylinder was also considered with its position relative to the bleed duct important for heat transfer as it was effectively eliminated when located below the bleed duct with a higher surface temperature. The findings of this thesis allow for a detailed understanding of the thermal environment and flow structure in a non-standard enclosure shape subjected to exterior heating and internal heat source. This is of practical relevance for the design of aircraft enclosures to help eliminate the possibility of thermal failure of components and affect aircraft operations...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to {{airborne}} influenza (or flu) from a patient's {{cough and}} exhaled air causes potential flu virus transmission to the persons located nearby. Hospital-acquired influenza {{is a major}} airborne disease that occurs to health care workers (HCW). This paper examines the airflow patterns and influenza-infected cough aerosol transport behavior in a ceiling-ventilated mock airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) and its effectiveness in mitigating HCW's exposure to airborne infection. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the airflow patterns and the flu virus dispersal behavior in a mock AIIR is conducted using the room geometries and layout (room dimensions, bathroom dimensions and details, placement of vents and furniture), ventilation parameters (flow rates at the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>vents,</b> diffuser design, thermal sources, etc.), and pressurization corresponding {{to that of a}} traditional ceiling-mounted ventilation arrangement observed in existing hospitals. The measured data shows that ventilation rates for the AIIR are about 12 air changes per hour(ach). However, the numerical results reveals incomplete air mixing and that not all of the room air is changed 12 times per hour. Two life-sized breathing human models are used to simulate a source patient and a receiving HCW. A patient cough cycle is introduced into the simulation and the airborne infection dispersal is tracked in time using a multiphase flow simulation approach. The results reveal air recirculation regions that diminished the effect of air filtration and prolong the presence of flu-contaminated air at the HCW's zone. Immediately after the patient coughs (0. 51 s), the cough velocity from the patient's mouth drives the cough aerosols toward the HCW standing next to patient's bed. Within 0. 7 s, the HCW is at risk of acquiring the infectious influenza disease, as a portion of these aerosols are inhaled by the HCW. As time progresses (5 s), the aerosols eventually spread throughout the entire room, as they are carried by the AIIR airflow patterns. Subsequently, a portion of these aerosols are removed by the exhaust ventilation. However, the remaining cough aerosols reenter and recirculate in the HCW's zone until they are removed by the exhaust ventilation. The infectious aerosols become diluted in the HCW's region over a period of 10 s because of the fresh air supplied into the HCW's zone. The overall duration of influenza infection in the room (until the aerosol count is reduced to less than 0. 16 % {{of the total number of}} aerosols ejected from the patient's mouth) is recorded as approximately 20 s. With successive coughing events, a near-continuous exposure would be possible. Hence, the ceiling-ventilation arrangement of the mock AIIR creats an unfavorable environment to the HCW throughout his stay in the room, and the modeled AIIR ventilation is not effective in protecting the HCW from infectious cough aerosols. The CFD results suggest that the AIIR ceiling ventilation arrangement has a significant role in influencing the flu virus transmission to the HCW.

Los cuerpos de travertino constituyen estratos delgados de hasta 60 cm de espesor de calcita micrítica finamente laminada, en ocasiones con estratificación rítmica de calcita y ópalo, asociados a depósitos de tobas de caída y tufitas de ambiente lacustre.

La {{posterior}} silicificación de los niveles carbonáticos produjeron jasperoides que se presentan como cuerpos tabulares subverticales y subhorizontales, estos últimos con características texturales similares a aquellas de sinters. La silicificación se originó tardíamente, posiblemente durante la etapa principal del régimen hidrotermal que generó las vetas portadoras de plata y oro. Los travertinos se formaron en un ambiente de hot spring, relacionado con fracturas de un sistema de cizalla conjugado orientadas entre N 20 ° a 45 ° E y N 20 ° a 40 ° O y constituyen las evidencias más tempranas de la presencia de un régimen epitermal asociado al proceso volcánico jurásico, en un régimen tectónico distensivo, en Manantial Espejo.

Their possible relationship with the epithermal mineralization is also considered. The Manantial Espejo district is located on the southwestern area of the Deseado Massif, in the middle of the province of Santa Cruz (Fig. 1). The area is almost entirely covered by andesitic and rhyolithic rocks of the Bajo Pobre and Chon Aike Formations, the product of a strong, bimodal volcanic activity of Jurassic age. This volcanic event developed in a back-arc tectonic environment linked to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean (Uliana et al., 1985; Riley et al., 2001). Acidic rocks prevail in the area, consisting on high-grade ignimbrites with ash fall tuffs, tuffites, and hydroclastic breccias (Fig. 2). Among them, the chemical and biogenic carbonate and silica deposits, are present (Fig. 3). The travertine mantles can be up to 0. 5 m thick and, in most of cases, they overlie tuffite layers. Typically, the rock is laminated in millimetrical to submillimetrical laminae of dense, hard, non porous micritic carbonate, displaying three types of lamination: parallel sub-horizontal; stromatolithic; and, «en echelon» (possibly, a terrace facies, Fig. 4). Sometimes, the laminated structure consists of a rhythmic deposit of calcium carbonate and opal (Figs. 5 a, b), unusual association in hot spring deposits, both recent and fossil (Jones et al., 2000 a; Campbell et al., 2002; Canet et al., 2005). A variety of porous travertine, dominated by small, sub-spherical and columnar growths, of the microstromatolithic or the oncoid types. The travertine layers grade laterally to siliceous laminated jasperoids (sensu Spur, 1898 and Lovering, 1972), which make sub-horizontal mantles, 0. 5 to 2. 0 m thick, with identical sedimentary structures as those of travertines, although they are entirely formed of chalcedony, which is interpreted as the product of replacement of calcite into silica (Fig. 6 a, b). Silicification occurred at a later stage, during the intense hydrothermal alteration accompanying the formation of the quartz veins carrying gold and silver. Some jasperoid outcrops show grossly stratified, rounded surfaces with domical structures, forming banks 0. 2 to 0. 4 m thick, and showing a more or less concentric layout which could correspond to the silicification of bio-built algal structures (Fig. 6 b). The occurrence of small vents (Fig. 6 e) show the water and steam outlets. Vertical, tabular, laminated bodies, filling fractures of NE-SW strike and slip up to 1, 000 m, and 3 m thick (Fig. 6 f, h). They are formed of chalcedony, displaying a vertical, banded and, at times, diffuse (Fig. 6 g) or breccia like structure. The morphology of the travertines and associated jasperoids in the Manantial Espejo district are compared with travertines or hot spring deposits in general, of Quaternary or Recent (Guo and Riding, 1999; Chafetz and Guidry, 2003; Hancock et al., 1999). The analogies founded allowed to reconstruct, at least in part, the depositional environment of the studied rocks (Fig. 8). The sub-vertical, tabular bodies of banded silica, would correspond to subsurface levels of fissure ridges, where erosion has generally eliminated the surface deposits with sub-horizontal stratification overlying the faults. The northernmost end of the Ayelen Oeste «vein» (Fig. 6 h) would correspond to the proximal zone of the discharge channel, very close to the fissure, since part of the sub-horizontal stratification next to the fracture (zone B in Fig. 8). This area represents the most active depositional environment, where the carbonate precipitation rate is higher. Figure 6 e shows a fluid <b>outlet</b> <b>vent</b> in a spring zone (zone C, in Fig. 8). The «en echelon» stratification shows very similar characteristics to those of terraces and micro-terraces occurring in modern hot springs. Micro-terraces shown in Figure 5 e, found near one of the fissure crests, could correspond to those formed laterally to the outlet channels (D, in Fig. 8). As to that shown in Figure 5 f, associated to travertine with sub-horizontal, parallel lamination, could correspond to that formed in the edges of pools. With regard to the parallel lamination of micritic carbonate, occurring in most of the outcrops, it may correspond to the lacustrine rims (sensu Pentecost, 1995). This type of thin lamination, forming laterally extended banks, several tens of decimeters thick, would have formed on depressed surfaces, with a distal position relative to the spring zones. The rhythmic intercalation of thin opal laminae between the calcite layers occurring in some outcrops, reveals temporary changes in the physical-chemical conditions of the mineral precipitation, possibly seasonal temperature fluctuations. Finally, the observed stromatolites and microstromatolites (Fig. 5 c, g, h) indicate the presence of microorganisms in the geothermal environment. Although there is no agreement among researchers about the organic or inorganic origin of these morphotypes in geothermal environments, it is admitted that algae and bacteria induce the precipitation of calcium carbonate. The stratigraphic position of the calcareous levels identified in Manantial Espejo show that the hot spring environment began to develop early in the district, associated to an extensional tectonic regime coincident with the La Frisia or Zanjón del Pescado System (Reimer et al., 1996) which caused fracturing (direct faults) N 20 ° to 45 º E, and N 20 º to 40 ° W, as a consequence of aó 1 located around 0 °. The produced faults, made the main hydrothermal fluid circulation channels (barren) which, after reaching the surface and losing the dissolved CO 2, precipitated the calcium carbonate. The migration of the maximum stress (anti clockwise, at 315 °) produced a new stress field, the Bajo Grande System (Panza, 1982, 1984) generating direct faulting combined with dextral movement, at a 110 ° azimuth, cutting and displacing the subvertical travertine bodies. These new fluid circulation channels end up lodging the quartz veins carrying silver and gold...|$|R
