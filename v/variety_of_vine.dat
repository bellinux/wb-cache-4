While newer vineyards have been experimenting with a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>vine</b> training systems, in Austria Grüner Veltliner has been historically trained in the Lenz Moser style developed in the 1920s.

40|$|The {{decline and}} the {{fragmentation}} of the areas devoted to viticulture in the Mendrisio district (Ticino) {{since the end of}} last Century, as revealed by topographic maps, is a sign of the profound transformation of both landscape and society. It is not only the surface which has changed but also the human activities: - mixed culture has been replaced by specialized cultivation (monoculture) - the <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>vine</b> grown has decreased considerably - the vintner has become independent, working his vineyard parttime only. These transformations reflect the mutual relationship between space and society, inside and towards the outside. Thus three different explanations can be offered: - the "inherited space" {{from the end of the}} last Century - the "polysemic space", i. e. the space at the intersection of relations between the Mendrisiotto and other regions, in particular Ticino and Lombardy, Switzerland and Italy - the existing relations between space and society as far as considered. <br...|$|E

In the Introduction, {{the significance of}} the study is represented by showing why the study for use of vine plants in Japan is belated to those in Europe and America and also the possibility of the vine plants being used extensively in the urban green and landscaping projects in Japan. In Chapter 1, the characteristics of vine plants are investigated theoretically, and a methodological framework for case study and analysis is examined. First, the vine plants are classified in seven categories {{from the point of view}} that they are organs climbing on other objects, and to these is added one category for other plants showing similar properties to the lianas, being specified as 2 ̆ 2 lianoid plants. 2 ̆ 2 Thus, the vine plants are classified in total eight categories according to their characteristics for application. On the other hand, the structures on which the vine plants are dependent are classified in fifteen types. Then, theoretically possible combinations of vine plants and their supports are investigated, and a table serving as a basis for analysis is prepared. In Chapter 2, the result of investigation and analysis of the cases of vine plants mainly in the urban area in Tokyo is shown, and the problems to be resolved hereafter are discussed. The findings of the investigation are generally as follows: a) The vine plants used over a wall of a large scale are comprised overwhelmingly of Japanese ivy which has a strong adsorptive force shows a growth coming up to a height of 20 m in about 10 years; b) With the new type commercial high-rise buildings, nutant characteristics of the plants of the hedera genus are generally employed; c) With the tea houses, restanrants and other similar shops, the vine plants are used in order to give an impression of Western style; d) In the independent houses, use of a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>vine</b> plants is seen; e) For the trellis, the traditional wisteria is used generally...|$|E
