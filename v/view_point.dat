5|$|There {{are a few}} {{inconsistencies}} {{from the}} naturalist's <b>view</b> <b>point.</b> Foxes and badgers are not necessarily mutual enemies in nature. Badgers do not normally invade the homes of foxes, and are not typically dirty. Badgers do sometimes eat bunnies, not from a predilection for bunnies but {{simply because they are}} omnivorous. The inconsistencies are few and employed to create individual characters rather than evoke an archetypical fox and badger.|$|E
5|$|Historically, insects {{have been}} the most {{significant}} herbivores, and the evolution of land plants is closely associated with the evolution of insects. While most plant defenses are directed against insects, other defenses have evolved that are aimed at vertebrate herbivores, such as birds and mammals. The study of plant defenses against herbivory is important, not only from an evolutionary <b>view</b> <b>point,</b> but also in the direct impact that these defenses have on agriculture, including human and livestock food sources; as beneficial 'biological control agents' in biological pest control programs; {{as well as in the}} search for plants of medical importance.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics who {{identify}} {{issues with the}} traditionalist <b>view</b> <b>point</b> to possible anachronisms in The Art of War including terms, technology (such as anachronistic crossbows and the unmentioned cavalry), philosophical ideas, events, and military techniques that {{should not have been}} available to Sun Wu. Additionally, there are no records of professional generals during the Spring and Autumn period; these are only extant from the Warring States period, so there is doubt as to Sun Tzu's rank and generalship. This caused much confusion as to when The Art of War was actually written. The first traditional view is that it was written in 512 BC by the historical Sun Wu, active {{in the last years of}} the Spring and Autumn period (c. 722–481 BC). A second view, held by scholars such as Samuel Griffith, places The Art of War during the middle to late Warring States period (c. 481–221 BC). Finally, a third school claims that the slips were published in the last half of the 5th century BC; this is based on how its adherents interpret the bamboo slips discovered at Yin-ch’ueh-shan in 1972 AD.|$|E

25|$|Chen's and the Democratic Progressive Party {{position}} on Taiwan's political status is that Taiwan is already an independent, sovereign nation named the Republic of China.

At the same time, {{it also has the}} implication that the pledge by Chen to preserve the status quo or not change Taiwan's sovereign status would not preclude a declaration of independence but would preclude acceptance of the one China policy.|$|E

25|$|Black Fell is {{the high}} point in the hilly area bounded by Windermere, Langdale and Coniston.

Despite its modest altitude Alfred Wainwright accorded Black Fell a chapter in his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, partly due to its excellence as a <b>view</b> <b>point.</b> It represents {{the perimeter of the}} Lakeland Fells proper in his opinion, the land to the south falling within his supplementary volume, The Outlying Fells of Lakeland.

25|$|An {{alternative}} <b>view</b> <b>point</b> {{was argued}} in the 1970s and 1980s by Carl Sagan and Frank Drake, among others.

Given the principle of mediocrity (in the same vein as the Copernican principle), {{it is probable that}} the universe teems with complex life. Ward and Brownlee argue to the contrary: that planets, planetary systems, and galactic regions that are as friendly to complex life as are the Earth, the Solar System, and our region of the Milky Way are very rare.|$|E

25|$|The {{works of}} Asín Palacios are widely admired, {{notwithstanding}} criticism that his <b>view</b> <b>point</b> {{was of a}} Christian priest while involved in the neutral academic field of Islamic studies. In his own country, the labors of the Spanish Arabists, to which he contributed greatly, has over the generations worked to favorably alter the view shared by many Spaniards concerning the Muslim period of their history. His spiritual insights into Islamic mysticism illuminated formerly obscure figures and hidden connections. Perhaps, too, along with Louis Massignon and others, {{it can be said}} that the Professor Rev. Miguel Asín Palacios was instrumental in the open recognition by the Catholic Church of Islam as a legacy of Abraham, articulated in the Nostra aetate document of Vatican II (1962–1965).|$|E
25|$|Many {{welcomed the}} {{progressive}} changes, but preferred {{to manage their}} own affairs. Kayr al-Din in the 1860s and 1870s had introduced modernizing reforms before the French occupation. Some of his companions later founded the weekly magazine al-Hadira in 1888. A more radical one al-Zahra ran from 1890 until suppressed in 1896; as was the Sabil al-Rashad of 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Tha'alibi, who was inspired by Muhammad 'Abduh of Cairo, among others. Bashir Sfar initiated the discussion group Khalduniya in 1896. 'Ali Bash Hamba founded the French language journal Tunisien to inform the French public of the Tunisian complaints, but only increased unrest. Tha'alibi founded the Arabic language Tunisien in 1909, to challenge Hamba from a Tunisian <b>view</b> <b>point.</b> In 1911 there were civil disturbances started within the universities. Hamba and Tha'alibi came together. A political party was begun, al-Ittihad al-Islami , which had pro-Ottoman leanings. Issues concerning a Muslim cemetery, the Jallaz, sparked large demonstrations which ended with martial law and the killing of many Tunisians in late 1911. Further demonstrations in 1912 led to {{the closing of the}} nationalist newspapers and the exiling of nationalist leadership.|$|E
25|$|This <b>view</b> <b>point</b> is {{rejected}} {{or at least}} controversially discussed by {{those who want to}} preserve the “pure” dingo. Here for instance the molecular biologist Alan Wilton from the University of New South Wales argues that a maximizing of the “genetic purity” is an essential aspect of the dingo conservation. Dingo-hybrids would supposedly increase the predation on native species, because they would have more litters per year and therefore would have to raise more pups and some of them would be bigger than the average dingo. He also argued that it is, for instance, not sufficient to regard a wild dog with a little non-dingo-content as a “pure” dingo if it more or less acts the same way. Wilton was of the opinion that the scale had to be set higher when “pure” dingoes are available. Corbett and Daniels agreed that it is practical and desirable to minimize the effect of other domestic dog genes. By this it would first be possible to find areas were the process is slower {{and to be able to}} limit it later; and second the populations would be able to develop accordingly to their natural environment. Furthermore, hybrids and other feral domestic dogs would probably not have the same tourist effect, because they don’t correspond with the current expectations on wild dingoes.|$|E

500|$|However, Hamilton's {{opposition}} to a Bill of Rights was far from universal. Robert Yates, writing under the pseudonym Brutus, articulated this <b>view</b> <b>point</b> in the so-called Anti-Federalist No. 84, asserting that a government unrestrained by such a bill could easily devolve into tyranny. References in The Federalist and in the ratification debates warn of demagogues of the variety who through divisive appeals would aim at tyranny. The Federalist begins and ends with this issue. In the final paper Hamilton offers [...] "a lesson of moderation to all sincere lovers of the Union, and [...] ought {{to put them on}} their guard against hazarding anarchy, civil war, a perpetual alienation of the States from each other, and perhaps the military despotism of a successful demagogue". The matter was further clarified by the Ninth Amendment.|$|E
500|$|In general, Sudry {{designed}} the visual effects in Fill the Void {{to create a}} claustrophobic <b>view</b> <b>point.</b> Blurred backgrounds were often utilized {{to focus on the}} faces of the characters, and most of the long takes were shot from an interior perspective. Sudry used Arri Alexa cameras and short-range lenses with limited camera movements to maintain the effect. Burshtein explained that this was done to illustrate that [...] "the heart is very colorful and very small" [...] and that [...] "we as human beings only see fragments of the big picture; God sees the whole thing!" [...] While a [...] "documentary feel" [...] was retained throughout most the film's duration, the style was switched for the wedding scene to create a euphoric atmosphere similar to those used in productions by Terrence Malick and David Lynch.|$|E

The water that is touched by the wheel is said to become blessed and carries its purifying power into all life forms in the oceans and lakes that it feeds into. On the approach path to the monastery, there is a Lakhang (village level monastery) and a temple of Urgyan Tsemo ("U-rgyan rTse-mo") which, like the main monastery, is located on a rocky plateau with a precipitous projection of several hundred feet over the valley. From this location, the monastery’s buildings are on the opposite ravine, which is known by the name “Copper-Colored Mountain Paradise of Padmasambhava”. This is the <b>view</b> <b>point</b> for visitors and there is a cafeteria to provide refreshments. The trek beyond this point is very scenic with the sound of the water fall breaking the silence. Along the trek route blue pine trees, prayer flags and kiosks selling paraphernalia for worship (such as prayer wheels, temple bells and skulls) are seen. The route is scattered with number of temples. On this path, a large water fall, which drops by [...] into a sacred pool, is forded over by a bridge. The track terminates at the main monastery where colorful paintings are displayed. Guru Rinpoche's cave where he meditated is also seen. This cave is opened for public viewing only once a year.|$|E
