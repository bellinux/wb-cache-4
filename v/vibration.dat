5|$|The {{study of}} {{vibrations}} in bikes includes its causes, such as engine balance, wheel balance, ground surface, and aerodynamics; its transmission and absorption; {{and its effects}} on the bike, the rider, and safety. An important factor in any <b>vibration</b> analysis is a comparison of the natural frequencies of the system with the possible driving frequencies of the <b>vibration</b> sources. A close match means mechanical resonance that can result in large amplitudes. A challenge in <b>vibration</b> damping is to create compliance in certain directions (vertically) without sacrificing frame rigidity needed for power transmission and handling (torsionally). Another issue with <b>vibration</b> for the bike is the possibility of failure due to material fatigue Effects of <b>vibration</b> on riders include discomfort, loss of efficiency, Hand-Arm <b>Vibration</b> Syndrome, a secondary form Raynaud's disease, and whole body <b>vibration.</b> Vibrating instruments may be inaccurate or difficult to read.|$|E
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a second window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the <b>vibration.</b> This <b>vibration</b> is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. <b>Vibration</b> of the oval window causes <b>vibration</b> of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E

40|$|Assassin bugs (Stenolemus bituberus) hunt web-building spiders by invading {{the web and}} {{plucking}} {{the silk}} to generate <b>vibrations</b> that lure the resident spider into striking range. To test whether <b>vibrations</b> generated by bugs aggressively mimic the <b>vibrations</b> generated by insect prey, we compared the responses of spiders to bugs with how they responded to prey, courting male spiders and leaves falling into the web. We also analysed the associated <b>vibrations.</b> Similar spider orientation and approach behaviours were observed in response to <b>vibrations</b> from bugs and prey, whereas different behaviours were observed in response to <b>vibrations</b> from male spiders and leaves. Peak frequency and duration of <b>vibrations</b> generated by bugs {{were similar to those}} generated by prey and courting males. Further, <b>vibrations</b> from bugs had a temporal structure and amplitude that were similar to <b>vibrations</b> generated by leg and body movements of prey and distinctly different to <b>vibrations</b> from courting males or leaves, or prey beating their wings. To be an effective predator, bugs do not need to mimic the full range of prey <b>vibrations.</b> Instead bugs are general mimics of a subset of prey <b>vibrations</b> that fall within the range of <b>vibrations</b> classified by spiders as ‘prey’...|$|R

The cockpit is fitted with armoured seats for the crew, and can withstand an impact velocity of over 10m/s. Dual flight controls are provided, though the AW101 can be flown by a single person. The pilots' instrument displays include six full-colour high-definition screens and an optional mission display; a digital map or forward looking infrared (FLIR) display can also be installed.|$|E

Their sample size included 20 babies of age 35 weeks or more, and they tracked their subjects' levels of pain on the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale while giving mechanical <b>vibration</b> to alleviate discomfort for a heel stick procedure. <b>Vibration</b> was delivered using the Magic Wand, which they bought through Vibratex. They set the Magic Wand to the highest setting {{and placed it on}} the heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure. Their results found that oscillation sensations delivered to newborns who had previously had discomfort from neonatal heel pricks were able to deliver some relief. They wrote that additional research was indicated in the form of a randomized clinical trial with a greater sample size of newborns.|$|E

5|$|In various {{applications}} to physical problems, a function can be decomposed into physically meaningful eigenfunctions of a differential operator (typically the Laplace operator): this forms {{the foundation for}} the spectral study of functions, in reference to the spectrum of the differential operator. A concrete physical application involves the problem of hearing the shape of a drum: given the fundamental modes of <b>vibration</b> that a drumhead is capable of producing, can one infer the shape of the drum itself? The mathematical formulation of this question involves the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplace equation in the plane, that represent the fundamental modes of <b>vibration</b> in direct analogy with the integers that represent the fundamental modes of <b>vibration</b> of the violin string.|$|E

Reducing these hull <b>vibrations</b> becomes increasingly {{important to make}} better surroundings for crew and to prolong the life of ship hull and machines. This report shows how hull <b>vibrations</b> are reduced by replacing conventional CPP blades with highly skewed CPP blades. The results of the replacement are as follows: 1) Vertical and longitudinal <b>vibrations</b> are effectively reduced and further both <b>vibrations</b> perceived by human bodies are reduced at the stern part of the ship. 2) The further {{the distance from the}} propeller, the smaller the effect of reducing vertical <b>vibrations,</b> and the tendency of reducing longitudinal <b>vibrations</b> is recognized up to near the main engine. 3) Athwart <b>vibrations</b> are hardly reduced at the almost every part of the ship. 昭和 62 年の入渠時,従来型のプロペラ翼からハイリースキュードプロペラ翼への換装を行い,両プロペラ装備時のそれぞれの振動計測を船内各部において実施し,次のような結果を得た。 1) 船尾部分においては,垂直方向および船首尾方向(水平) の振動とも減少が顕著で,体感振動の減少も測定結果と同様であった。 2) 垂直方向の振動は,プロペラからの距離が大きくなるに従いその減少割合が低下し,船首尾方向の振動の減少は主機関に近い部分まで認められた。 3) 左右舷方向(水平) の振動はどの場所でも殆ど減少しないことがわかった...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} <b>vibrations</b> of {{membranes}} is of importance {{in connection with}} design of loudspeaker diaphragms, telephone receivers and microphones and many other acoustical devices but also non-acoustical devices like automobiles. For higher order modes of <b>vibrations</b> calculating and plotting the <b>vibrations</b> becomes difficult. But {{it is easy to}} simulate these <b>vibrations</b> in computer graphics. In this paper <b>vibrations</b> of rectangular membranes are simulated in different modes taking care of the boundary conditions. It is also possible to visualise the actual <b>vibrations</b> in the computer monitor by allowing the membrane to vibrate from a maximum to minimum amplitude. To simulate these <b>vibrations,</b> nowadays, simulation packages like Mathematica. Maple, MATLAB etc. are being used.

25|$|Classical {{conditioning}} {{is described}} as the pairing of a conditioned stimulus (CS) (such as a <b>vibration)</b> with an unconditioned stimulus (US) (such as a loud noise) to evoke a conditioned response (CR) (agitation). In this pairing, the <b>vibration</b> will be presented immediately followed by a loud noise. Initially, {{the presentation of the}} loud noise (US) would cause the unconditioned response (UR) (natural agitation) without prior classical conditioning. However, the continuous pairing of the loud noise (US) with the <b>vibration</b> (CS) converts the unconditioned response (UR) into a (CR) as the fetus learns that the presentation of a <b>vibration</b> will be followed by a loud noise. Eventually, the fetus will respond to the <b>vibration</b> (CS) without being exposed to the loud noise (US); this is when conditioning has occurred. Conditioning has been demonstrated in as few as 12-15 pairings of the <b>vibration</b> (CS) with the loud noise (US) in fetuses as early as 32 weeks of gestation.|$|E

The values of the spring and mass give a natural frequency of 7nbsp&Hz for this specific system. Applying the 1nbsp&Hz square wave from earlier allows the calculation of the predicted <b>vibration</b> of the mass. The figure illustrates the resulting <b>vibration.</b> It happens in this example that the fourth harmonic of the square wave falls at 7nbsp&Hz. The frequency response of the massndash&springndash&damper therefore outputs a high 7nbsp&Hz <b>vibration</b> even though the input force had a relatively low 7nbsp&Hz harmonic. This example highlights that the resulting <b>vibration</b> is dependent on both the forcing function and the system that the force is applied to.|$|E
