5|$|Dr. Garcia J. DeSousa, board-certified {{neurologist}} in St. Petersburg, Florida, {{who previously}} treated Terri Schiavo, {{cared for her}} during her initial admission to Humana Northside; both he and Dr. Victor Gambone, an internist and Schiavo family physician, independently made the diagnosis of persistent <b>vegetative</b> <b>state</b> (PVS) within approximately one year after her sudden cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|In the 2013, the perturbational {{complexity}} index (PCI) was proposed, {{a measure}} of the algorithmic complexity of the electrophysiological response of the cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation. This measure was shown to be higher in individuals that are awake, in REM sleep or in a locked-in state than in those who are in deep sleep or in a <b>vegetative</b> <b>state,</b> making it potentially useful as a quantitative assessment of consciousness states.|$|E
5|$|They {{argued that}} {{persistent}} <b>vegetative</b> <b>state</b> is frequently misdiagnosed, {{and that the}} reasons for withdrawal of life support from a patient should be scrutinized since even family member surrogates can have conflicts of interest. The Palm Sunday Compromise granted the federal review they sought, but it was limited to only the Schiavo case.|$|E

5|$|Dyrwood is cursed by the Hollowborn Plague: {{children}} are being born without souls, leaving them totally unresponsive in a way similar to a permanent <b>vegetative</b> <b>state.</b> Many people blame animancers, the scientists who study and manipulate souls. Investigating the curse, the Watcher discovers that the Hollowborns' souls have in fact been stolen by a cult known as the Leaden Key, led by a priest named Thaos, and that Thaos is framing animancers for the Plague. This eventually leads to a riot {{in the capital city}} where animancers are lynched and their college is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that inhibit consciousness are considered disorders of consciousness. This category generally includes minimally conscious state and persistent <b>vegetative</b> <b>state,</b> but sometimes {{also includes the}} less severe locked-in syndrome and more severe chronic coma. Differential diagnosis of these disorders is an active area of biomedical research. Finally, brain death results in an irreversible disruption of consciousness. While other conditions may cause a moderate deterioration (e.g., dementia and delirium) or transient interruption (e.g., grand mal and petit mal seizures) of consciousness, they {{are not included in}} this category.|$|E
5|$|Nemo {{stays with}} his father, who later becomes disabled. He {{works in a}} shop and spends his free time at home at the typewriter, writing a science fiction story about a journey to Mars. At a school dance, he meets Elise and falls in love. A few days later, Nemo goes to Elise's house but sees her with her 22-year-old boyfriend. Frustrated, he speeds away on his motorcycle, has an {{accident}} and is hospitalized in a <b>vegetative</b> <b>state.</b> Though he can perceive the world through his senses, Nemo cannot move or speak. He detects his parents' reunion at his bedside. Nemo tries to remember the movement of {{his fingers on the}} typewriter keyboard and eventually manages to lift a finger as this story line comes to a close.|$|E

5|$|Complications are {{distinct}} medical problems that may arise {{as a result}} of the TBI. The results of traumatic brain injury vary widely in type and duration; they include physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral complications. TBI can cause prolonged or permanent effects on consciousness, such as coma, brain death, persistent <b>vegetative</b> <b>state</b> (in which patients are unable to achieve a state of alertness to interact with their surroundings), and minimally conscious state (in which patients show minimal signs of being aware of self or environment). Lying still for long periods can cause complications including pressure sores, pneumonia or other infections, progressive multiple organ failure, and deep venous thrombosis, which can cause pulmonary embolism. Infections that can follow skull fractures and penetrating injuries include meningitis and abscesses. Complications involving the blood vessels include vasospasm, in which vessels constrict and restrict blood flow, the formation of aneurysms, in which the side of a vessel weakens and balloons out, and stroke.|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan {{appears in}} several StarCraft novels that greatly expand her backstory {{before the first}} StarCraft game. The novel Uprising portrays Kerrigan's {{training}} as a Ghost assassin from an early age, where she is subjected to intense psychological abuse from her Confederate trainer, Lieutenant Rumm. When {{she was a young}} girl, an accident, most likely involving her powers, kills her mother and puts her father in a <b>vegetative</b> <b>state.</b> Consequently, Kerrigan is terrified to use her psionic abilities, and refuses Rumm's demands to show her power, even when he threatens to kill her father. Kerrigan is eventually subdued with mental implants and used as a top Confederate assassin until she is rescued by Arcturus Mengsk. The novels Liberty's Crusade and Queen of Blades provide novelisations for Kerrigan's actions in Episodes I and II of StarCraft respectively. Liberty's Crusade develops the implied relationship between Jim Raynor and Kerrigan, while Queen of Blades serves to demonstrate Kerrigan's complete transformation by the Zerg, her removal of her inhibitions and morality, and its effect on her former love, Raynor.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{head trauma}} {{is thought to}} be influenced in part by the location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not. They also have a higher risk of severe disability and persistent <b>vegetative</b> <b>state,</b> and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and longer stays in the intensive care unit. However, more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.|$|E
50|$|In summary, {{those with}} {{minimally}} conscious state and non-traumatic brain injuries will not progress {{as well as}} those with traumatic brain injuries while those in <b>vegetative</b> <b>states</b> have an all around lower to minimal chance of recovery.|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} master's {{thesis is}} divided into two parts: part one is based on available sociological literature and deals with issues related to families caring for children in <b>vegetative</b> <b>states.</b> It begins by defining a few basic concepts and ideas and moves on to lay out processes by which families adjust to the onset of severe handicaps in their children (or when their children are born with handicaps) and to some of the main changes they confront and challenges they face. It continues by looking at these families' needs (which should be the basis for determining what services to provide them) and concludes by summarizing the social services that support the home care of children in <b>vegetative</b> <b>states,</b> both historically and in the present day. Part two is based on my own experience and research. It compares and contrasts services provided to families in two places: Wayne County in New York State in the U. S. and the Trebic Region of the Czech Republic. I begin by describing services available in both regions to families with children in <b>vegetative</b> <b>states</b> living at home and continue with a brief comparison of these services. Main part of the research is based on an analysis of interviews conducted with parents (mostly mothers) of severely handicapped children in both Trebic and Wayne County. The interviews [...] ...|$|R
5|$|In 1960, {{fourteen}} years after Blazkowicz's admission, the Nazis {{order that the}} asylum is to be shut down, killing all the patients and executing Anya's family when they resist. Blazkowicz awakens from his <b>vegetative</b> <b>state</b> as {{he is about to}} be executed, killing the extermination squad and escaping the asylum with Anya. Blazkowicz and Anya drive to her grandparents' farm, where they inform him that the Nazis won the war by forcing the United States to surrender in 1948, and that the members of the ensuing Resistance were captured. Blazkowicz interrogates a captured officer from the asylum (he was hidden in the trunk of a car), learning that the top members of the Resistance are imprisoned in Berlin before brutally executing him with a chainsaw. Anya's grandparents smuggle her and Blazkowicz through a checkpoint in Stettin before they travel to Berlin. During the train ride, Blazkowicz and Anya enter into a romantic relationship. When they arrive, Anya helps Blazkowicz break into the prison, where he rescues the person he spared {{fourteen years}} prior (Fergus or Wyatt) and finds that the Resistance movement is a revived Kreisau Circle led by Caroline Becker (Bonita Friedericy), who was left paralyzed due to her injuries at Isenstadt.|$|E
25|$|Brain {{death is}} the {{complete}} loss of brain function (including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life). It differs from persistent <b>vegetative</b> <b>state,</b> in which the person is alive and some autonomic functions remain.|$|E

25|$|Andrew Devine, aged 22 at {{the time}} of the disaster, {{suffered}} similar injuries to Tony Bland and was also diagnosed as being in a persistent <b>vegetative</b> <b>state.</b> In March 1997—just before the eighth anniversary of the disaster—it was reported he had emerged from the condition and was able to communicate using a touch-sensitive pad, and he had been showing signs of awareness of his surroundings for up to three years before. He is still alive as of 2015.|$|E
50|$|Picoult {{first started}} {{developing}} the novel {{in the early}} 2000s after conversing with a neurologist about his patients that were in <b>vegetative</b> <b>states.</b> She chose to bring in elements of wolves after dreaming about them and wondering what a person would be like that lived with the wolves rather than studying them from afar.

25|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish between brain death and states that {{may be difficult to}} differentiate from brain death, (such as barbiturate overdose, alcohol intoxication, sedative overdose, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, coma, and chronic <b>vegetative</b> <b>states).</b> Some comatose patients can recover to pre-coma or near pre-coma level of functioning, and some patients with severe irreversible neurological dysfunction will nonetheless retain some lower brain functions, such as spontaneous respiration, despite the losses of both cortex and brain stem functionality. Such is the case with anencephaly.|$|R
40|$|Who are we?” {{has always}} been e central {{question}} for philosophers, theologians, scientists and jurists. Nowadays, there are great debates about issues such like how we should consider and what rights we should grant to embryos, fetes, stem cells, patients in <b>vegetative</b> <b>states.</b> From all sides, people make contrasting claims, but combatants seem to duel in the fog. In this book, which is written by three scholars, a new attempt is made to clarify the issue, by analyzing its historical genesis (between philosophy, law, and biology), and its possible solutions...|$|R
25|$|Webster was {{a central}} figure in the Terri Schiavo case which {{involved}} a dispute between relatives on whether to remove the feeding tube of an unconscious {{woman who had been}} in a persistent <b>vegetative</b> <b>state</b> for years. In March 2005, he introduced SB 804 that would have prohibited such patients from being denied food and water if family members disagreed on the patient's wishes and if the patient had not expressed his wishes in writing when competent. The bill failed to pass the Senate by three votes.|$|E
