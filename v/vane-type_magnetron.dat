40|$|The {{analytical}} {{expression for}} the signal-to-noise ratio of a slotted surface coil with an arbitrary number of slots was derived using the quasi-static approach. This surface coil {{based on the}} <b>vane-type</b> <b>magnetron</b> tube. To study the coil perfomance, the theoretical signal-to-noise ratio predictions of this coil design were computed using a different number of slots. Results were also compared with theoretical results obtained for a circular coil with similar dimensions. It can be appreciated that slotted surface coil performance improves {{as the number of}} coils increases and, outperformed the circular-shaped coil. This makes it a good candidate for other MRI applications involving coil array techniques...|$|E
