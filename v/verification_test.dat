25|$|The {{instigation}} of {{a controversial}} sex <b>verification</b> <b>test</b> by the International Amateur Athletics Federation for the 1966 European Athletics Championships saw many key women miss the tournament in protest, among them Press and Shchelkanova. This left Tikhomirova as the Soviet Union's sole representative in the pentathlon and she duly {{won the gold medal}} with a score of 4787 points, extending Soviet dominance in the event since 1954 (Aleksandra Chudina and Galina Bystrova being her predecessors). She defeated West Germany's Heide Rosendahl by a margin of 22 points.|$|E
2500|$|Following her {{victory at}} the world championships, {{questions}} were raised about her sex. Having beaten her previous 800m best by four seconds at the African Junior Championships just a month earlier, her quick improvements came under scrutiny. The combination of her rapid athletic progression and her appearance culminated in the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) asking her to take a sex <b>verification</b> <b>test</b> to ascertain whether she was female. The IAAF says it was [...] "obliged to investigate" [...] after she made improvements of 25 seconds at 1500 m and eight seconds at 800 m– [...] "the sort of dramatic breakthroughs that usually arouse suspicion of drug use." ...|$|E
2500|$|News {{that the}} IAAF {{requested}} the test broke {{three hours before}} the 2009 World Championships 800 m final. IAAF president Lamine Diack stated, [...] "There was a leak of confidentiality at some point and this led to some insensitive reactions." [...] The IAAF's handling of the case spurred many negative reactions. A number of athletes, including retired sprinter Michael Johnson, criticised the organisation for its response to the incident. [...] The IAAF said it confirmed the requirement for a sex <b>verification</b> <b>test</b> after the news had already {{been reported in the}} media, denying charges of racism and expressing regret about [...] "the allegations being made about the reasons for which these tests are being conducted." [...] The federation also explained that the motivation for the test was not suspected cheating but a desire to determine whether she had a [...] "rare medical condition" [...] giving her an [...] "unfair advantage". The president of the IAAF stated that the case could have been handled with more sensitivity.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{an attempt}} to develop a {{verification}} and validation standard for building fire evacuation models, Ronchi et al. (2013) at the United States’ National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommended a set of seventeen <b>verification</b> <b>tests.</b> We found that the application of these <b>verification</b> <b>tests</b> allowed us to make rather significant improvements to our simulation code (PEDFLOW) for {{approximately half of the}} recommended tests (Table 1). In some cases, we added capabilities that did not exist before. In other cases, we found anomalous behaviors and adjusted the existing code to remove these unexplained behaviors. This paper summarizes the work on the <b>verification</b> <b>tests,</b> highlighting the lessons learned and modifications made. We also discuss some modifications we recommend to the NIST <b>verification</b> <b>tests,</b> as well as demonstrate how to make these tests suitable for all pedestrian flow models (not just building fire evacuation) ...|$|R

50|$|Test {{coverage}} in the test plan states what requirements will be verified during what stages of the product life. Test coverage is derived from design specifications and other requirements, such as safety standards or regulatory codes, where each requirement or specification of the design ideally will have one or more corresponding means of <b>verification.</b> <b>Test</b> coverage for different product life stages may overlap, but will not necessarily be exactly {{the same for all}} stages. For example, some requirements may be verified during Design <b>Verification</b> <b>test,</b> but not repeated during Acceptance test. Test coverage also feeds back into the design process, since the product may have to be designed to allow test access.|$|E
