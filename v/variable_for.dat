5|$|Because of this {{experiment}} Hendrik Lorentz {{proposed that the}} motion of the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus to contract along its length in the direction of motion, and he further assumed, that the time <b>variable</b> <b>for</b> moving systems must also be changed accordingly ("local time"), which led to the formulation of the Lorentz transformation. Based on Lorentz's aether theory, Henri Poincaré (1900) showed that this local time (to first order in v/c) is indicated by clocks moving in the aether, which are synchronized under the assumption of constant light speed. In 1904, he speculated that the speed of light could be a limiting velocity in dynamics, provided that the assumptions of Lorentz's theory are all confirmed. In 1905, Poincaré brought Lorentz's aether theory into full observational agreement with the principle of relativity.|$|E

Species richness peaks at around 40° latitude, both north and south. This corresponds to {{the highest levels of}} primary production around North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. Total species range is highly <b>variable</b> <b>for</b> marine mammal species. On average most marine mammals have ranges which are equivalent or smaller than one-fifth of the Indian Ocean. The variation observed in range size {{is a result of the}} different ecological requirements of each species and their ability to cope with a broad range of environmental conditions. The high degree of overlap between marine mammal species richness and areas of human impact on the environment is of concern.|$|E

Subject of this research are karate elements which are most frequently used in karate fight, and the basic aim is to establish the structure of the same karate elements that are used in karate fight. In the research, 36 variables were applied: 4 anthropometric <b>variables,</b> 4 <b>variables</b> <b>for</b> estimation on the explosive strength, 4 <b>variables</b> <b>for</b> estimation on the segmented velocity (frequency of movements), 12 variables of the karate elements used in the karate fighting and 12 <b>variables</b> <b>for</b> estimation of the specific karate abilities in 3 motor spaces: 4 <b>variables</b> <b>for</b> estimation of the specific karate coordination, 4 <b>variables</b> <b>for</b> estimation of the specific karate precision and 4 <b>variables</b> <b>for</b> estimation of the specific karate balance.

5|$|Similar {{applications}} of 2-satisfiability {{have been made}} for other geometric placement problems. In graph drawing, if the vertex locations are fixed and each edge must be drawn as a circular arc with one of two possible locations (for instance as an arc diagram), then the problem of choosing which arc to use for each edge {{in order to avoid}} crossings is a 2-satisfiability problem with a <b>variable</b> <b>for</b> each edge and a constraint for each pair of placements that would lead to a crossing. However, in this case it is possible to speed up the solution, compared to an algorithm that builds and then searches an explicit representation of the implication graph, by searching the graph implicitly.|$|E

Huntington identified two shaping forces or imperatives for civilian control – (1) functional and (2) societal. He broke the societal imperative into two components, ideology and structure. By ideology, he meant a world-view or paradigm: liberal anti-military, conservative pro-military, fascist pro-military, and Marxist anti-military. By structure, he meant the legal-constitutional framework that guided political affairs generally and civil-military affairs specifically.|$|E
