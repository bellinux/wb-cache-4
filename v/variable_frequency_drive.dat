50|$|The {{installation}} {{and integration of}} variable frequency drives can lower the energy consumption of the building's circulation pumps to about 15% {{of what they had}} been using before. A <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> functions by modulating the frequency of the electricity provided to the motor that it powers. In the USA, the electrical grid uses a frequency of 60 Hertz or 60 cycles per second. Variable frequency drives are able to decrease the output and energy consumption of motors by lowering the frequency of the electricity provided to the motor, however the relationship between motor output and energy consumption is not a linear one. If the <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> provides electricity to the motor at 30 Hertz, the output of the motor will be 50% because 30 Hertz divided by 60 Hertz is 0.5 or 50%. The energy consumption of a motor running at 50% or 30 Hertz will not be 50%, but will instead be something like 18% because the relationship between motor output and energy consumption are not linear. The exact ratios of motor output or Hertz provided to the motor (which are effectively the same thing), and the actual energy consumption of the <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> / motor combination depend on the efficiency of the <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drive.</b> For example, because the <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> needs power itself to communicate with the building automation system, run its cooling fan, etc., if the motor always ran at 100% with the <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> installed the cost of operation or electricity consumption would actually go up with the new <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> installed. The amount of energy that variable frequency drives consume is nominal and is hardly worth consideration when calculating savings, however it did need to be noted that VFD's do consume energy themselves. Because the variable frequency drives rarely ever run at 100% and {{spend most of their time}} in the 40% output range, and because now the pumps completely shut down when not needed, the variable frequency drives have reduced the energy consumption of the pumps to around 15% of what they had been using before.|$|E

The study looks at insulating of tire molds, installation of <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> on circulating pumps, pressure reduction turbines, waste heat utilization used for absorption cooling, and cogeneration using a gas turbine cycle. A feasibility study and cost analysis was performed for each project to determine recommendation for implementation.

5000|$|A {{variable}} speed motor requires an additional device to supply electrical power throughout the desired frequency range.

50|$|Direct {{torque control}} (DTC) is one method used in <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> {{to control the}} torque (and thus finally the speed) of {{three-phase}} AC electric motors. This involves calculating {{an estimate of the}} motor's magnetic flux and torque based on the measured voltage and current of the motor.|$|R
5000|$|AC {{induction}} {{motors and}} synchronous motors are simple and low maintenance, but are awkward {{to apply for}} traction motors because of their fixed speed characteristic. An AC induction motor only generates useful amounts of power over a narrow speed range determined by its construction {{and the frequency of}} the AC power supply. The advent of power semiconductors has made it possible to fit a <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> on a locomotive; this allows a wide range of speeds, AC power transmission, and rugged induction motors without wearing parts like brushes and commutators.|$|E
50|$|Stator {{flux linkage}} is {{estimated}} by integrating the stator voltages. Torque is estimated as a cross product of estimated stator flux linkage vector and measured motor current vector. The estimated flux magnitude and torque are then {{compared with their}} reference values. If either the estimated flux or torque deviates {{too far from the}} reference tolerance, the transistors of the <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> are turned off and on {{in such a way that}} the flux and torque errors will return in their tolerant bands as fast as possible. Thus direct torque control is one form of the hysteresis or bang-bang control.|$|E
5000|$|Significantly Reduce Gen-set Sizing - for {{variable}} speed controllers, NFPA-20 2010 paragraph 9.4.3 allows the voltage drop {{to be no}} lower than 15% while starting, or lower while starting in bypass (depending on the manufacturers capabilities). Given this, a typical application for a 150 hp motor utilizing soft starting, a gen-set manufacturer's sizing program would select a 250 kW gen-set. For the same application, the program would select a 125 kW gen-set when using a <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> and a primary reactor bypass with a 30% starting voltage drop, cutting the gen-set in half (Slides 36-39).|$|E
25|$|Three-phase {{systems have}} the serious {{disadvantage}} of requiring {{at least two}} separate overhead conductors plus rail return. Locomotives operate at one, two or four constant speeds. Most modern locomotives with <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> can also do regenerative braking on both AC and DC systems and {{are not limited to}} constant speeds.|$|R
50|$|An {{adjustable}} speed drive might consist {{of an electric}} motor and controller {{that is used to}} adjust the motor's operating speed. The combination of a constant-speed motor and a continuously adjustable mechanical speed-changing device might also be called an {{adjustable speed}} drive. Power electronics based <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> are rapidly making older technology redundant.|$|R
25|$|Many Axial fan {{failures}} {{have happened}} after controlled blade axial fans {{were locked in}} a fixed position and <b>Variable</b> <b>Frequency</b> <b>Drives</b> (VFDs) were installed. The VFDs are not practical for some Axial fans. Axial fans with severe instability regions should not be operated at blades angles, rotational speeds, mass flow rates, and pressures that expose the fan to stall conditions.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of {{electrode}} boiler pumps water from {{the lower part of the}} vessel to an internal header that has nozzles that allow the water to flow to electrodes. Generally the working pressure is maintained at 10 bar. If more pressure is needed (more steam) the controls speed up the pump and flow more water through additional nozzles. As the needed pressure is reached the pump controls the flow of water to obtain the desired steam output (in kg per hour) at the desired pressure. On larger systems the pump can be controlled by a <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> (VFD) so energy is not wasted. This control system can also control de-aerator pumps and controls.|$|E
5000|$|An early {{advantage}} of AC {{is that the}} power-wasting resistors used in DC locomotives for speed control were not needed in an AC locomotive: multiple taps on the transformer can supply a range of voltages. Separate low-voltage transformer windings supply lighting and the motors driving auxiliary machinery. More recently, the development of very high power semiconductors has caused the classic [...] "universal" [...] AC/DC motor to be largely replaced with the three-phase induction motor fed by a <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drive,</b> a special inverter that varies both frequency and voltage to control motor speed. These drives can run equally well on DC or AC of any frequency, and many modern electric locomotives are designed to handle different supply voltages and frequencies to simplify cross-border operation.|$|E
