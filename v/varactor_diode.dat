40|$|Here is {{a method}} for using {{measured}} data to accurately describe {{the behavior of a}} <b>varactor</b> <b>diode,</b> providing the CAD simulator with a model that corresponds to actual device performance An accurate model for the <b>varactor</b> <b>diode</b> is necessary when designing a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) using CAD simulation. In order to predict tuning range, start up gain, and phase noise, the resonator must be accurately modeled over the frequency range of the oscillations. The <b>varactor</b> <b>diode</b> used for tuning has a predominant effect on the Q, phase noise and tuning range of the resonator. If the varactor model is inaccurate, the results of the most elaborate computer simulation will be misleading and the oscillator, when built, may have disappointing performance. <b>Varactor</b> <b>Diode</b> Model Figure 1 shows a commonly used lumped element <b>varactor</b> <b>diode</b> model. The values for package inductance and capacitance, Lp and Cp shown are typical for an 0805 surface mount part. The values for junction capacitance, Cj and Q are supplied by the manufacturer and are almost always specified at a low frequency, usually 50 MHz, and a bias voltage of – 4 Volts. Q is defined by Q = 1 /ωCjRs. This formula can be used to calculate the series resistance Rs of the varactor model at the measured frequency, however at microwave frequencies additional losses often result in a significantly higher value for Rs. Also, Rs decreases with increasing bias voltage as the width of the depletion region around the PN junction increases, reducing the length of the conductive path through the bulk semiconductor material surrounding the junction.
