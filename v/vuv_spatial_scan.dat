40|$|Abstract Background The <b>spatial</b> <b>scan</b> {{statistic}} {{proposed by}} Kulldorff {{has been applied}} {{to a wide variety of}} epidemiological studies for cluster detection. This scan statistic, however, uses a circular window to define the potential cluster areas and thus has difficulty in correctly detecting actual noncircular clusters. A recent proposal by Duczmal and Assunção for detecting noncircular clusters is shown to detect a cluster of very irregular shape that is much larger than the true cluster in our experiences. Methods We propose a flexibly shaped <b>spatial</b> <b>scan</b> statistic that can detect irregular shaped clusters within relatively small neighborhoods of each region. The performance of the proposed <b>spatial</b> <b>scan</b> statistic is compared to that of Kulldorff's circular <b>spatial</b> <b>scan</b> statistic with Monte Carlo simulation by considering several circular and noncircular hot-spot cluster models. For comparison, we also propose a new bivariate power distribution classified by the number of regions detected as the most likely cluster and the number of hot-spot regions included in the most likely cluster. Results The circular <b>spatial</b> <b>scan</b> statistics shows a high level of accuracy in detecting circular clusters exactly. The proposed <b>spatial</b> <b>scan</b> statistic is shown to have good usual powers plus the ability to detect the noncircular hot-spot clusters more accurately than the circular one. Conclusion The proposed <b>spatial</b> <b>scan</b> statistic is shown to work well for small to moderate cluster size, up to say 30. For larger cluster sizes, the method is not practically feasible and a more efficient algorithm is needed. </p...|$|R

The excess measurement noise for both modes is established by comparing the observed and theoretical measurement uncertainties. We find that the stare-mode observations produce differential measurements that are consistent and achieve ∼ 1. 3 times photon-limited measurement precision. In contrast, the spatial-scan mode observations produce measurements which are inconsistent, non-Gaussian, and have higher excess noise corresponding to ∼ 2 times the photon-limited precision. The inferior quality of the <b>spatial</b> <b>scan</b> observations is due to spatial-temporal variability in the detector performance which we measure and map. The non-Gaussian nature of <b>spatial</b> <b>scan</b> measurements makes the use of χ^ 2 and the determination of formal confidence intervals problematic and thus renders the comparison of <b>spatial</b> <b>scan</b> data with theoretical models or other measurements difficult.

Recent work in the disease surveillance community has proposed many variants of Kulldorff's original <b>spatial</b> <b>scan</b> statistic, including expectation-based Poisson and Gaussian statistics, and incorporates a variety of time series analysis methods to obtain expected counts. We evaluate the detection performance of twelve variants of <b>spatial</b> <b>scan,</b> using synthetic outbreaks injected into four real-world public health datasets. Results The relative performance of methods varies substantially {{depending on the size}} of the injected outbreak, the average daily count of the background data, and whether seasonal and day-of-week trends are present. The expectation-based Poisson (EBP) method achieves high performance across a wide range of datasets and outbreak sizes, making it useful in typical detection scenarios where the outbreak characteristics are not known. Kulldorff's statistic outperforms EBP for small outbreaks in datasets with high average daily counts, but has extremely poor detection power for outbreaks affecting more than of the monitored locations. Randomization testing did not improve detection power for the four datasets considered, is computationally expensive, and can lead to high false positive rates. Conclusion Our results suggest four main conclusions. First, <b>spatial</b> <b>scan</b> methods should be evaluated for a variety of different datasets and outbreak characteristics, since focusing only on a single scenario may give a misleading picture of which methods perform best.

This study set out to compare different statistical methods of hotspot detection (SaTScan, kernel smoothing, weighted local prevalence) using different indicators (PCR positivity, AMA- 1 and MSP- 1 antibodies) for prediction of infection the following year. Two full surveys of four villages in Mwanza, Tanzania were completed over consecutive years, 2010 - 2011. In both surveys, infection was assessed using nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR).

Baseline clustering of infection and serological markers were assessed using three geospatial methods: <b>spatial</b> <b>scan</b> statistics, kernel analysis and weighted local prevalence analysis. Methods were compared in their ability to predict infection in the second year of the study using random effects logistic regression models, and comparisons of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for each model.
