Volumes {{of the features}} on the map give relative probabilities of various ionisation sequences, which can be classiﬁed as: (a) Ne core-core; (b) H2O core-core, core-Auger, and Auger-Auger; (c) Ne Auger-Auger; (d) Ne valence-valence; (e) N2 core-Auger; (f) H2O core-valence; (g) Ne core-Auger; (h) Ne core-valence; (i) double Auger and secondary electrons from electrode surfaces; and (j) Ne main (core) photoelectron line.

40|$|We {{present the}} design for an upgrade to the GaAs {{photocathode}} electron gun on the ALICE (formerly ERLP) accelerator at Daresbury Laboratory. This propo-sed upgrade includes installation of a dedicated photo-cathode preparation facility, with side-loading of the activated photocathodes in to the gun and a reduction of the photocathode diameter from 32 to 10 mm. The prepa-ration facility forms a common vacuum system with the gun, isolated by a gate valve, permitting significant im-provement in the gun vacuum and a reduction of caesium <b>vapour</b> <b>contamination</b> improving gun stability at high vol-tage. This preparation facility will reduce the time required for a photocathode change from weeks to hours. The facility should also provide photocathodes with im-proved quantum efficiency due to a more controllable preparation procedure, and allows performance of experiments using photocathodes activated to different levels of electron affinity. ...|$|E

We have studied the influence of oxygen and water <b>vapour</b> <b>contaminations</b> on the performance of CsI photocathodes for the ALICE HMPID RICH prototype. Measurements were done through comparison of Cherenkov rings obtained from beam tests. Increased levels of oxygen and water vapour did not show any effect on the performance.

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of a high-pressure arc discharge has been performed with a self-consistent modelling {{of most of}} the components, including the electrodes, and the interactions between them. In particular, the arc column and the cathodic part of the discharge are simulated by means of a two-temperature hydrodynamic model and of a model of nonlinear surface heating, respectively. Simulation results are given for a free-burning arc in atmospheric-pressure argon in the range of arc currents from 10 to 200 A. It is found that the electric power deposited into the near-cathode layer is transported not only to the cathode but also to the arc column, an effect that cannot be described by the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model. The electron enthalpy transport substantially exceeds the net contribution of thermal conduction by the electrons and heavy particles and is thus the dominating mechanism of energy transfer from the near-cathode layer to the arc column. The predicted gas temperatures along the arc axis in the arc column using the LTE model are much higher than the calculated electron and heavy-particle temperatures (∼ 1000 – 2000 K or higher) under the same operation conditions using the non-equilibrium model with the consideration of the near-cathode sheath for the cases studied in the present paper. Studies on the influences of the cathode shapes and metal <b>vapour</b> <b>contaminations</b> on the arc characteristics will be conducted in future work.

40|$|Abstract—Methylene-bis-o-chloroaniline (MBOCA) {{is used in}} the {{production}} of moulded articles with a hard integral skin from polyurethane foam and also hard urethane rubbers. Animal experiments using rats had previously shown a high incidence of cancers. Subsequent experiments using dogs have so far been negative and there have been no cases of human cancer attributable to MBOCA. Nevertheless it is a substance which should be used under strict control and supervision. All processes involving MBOCA-—handling, weighing, melting and mixing—should be carried out under exhaust ventilation. Inhalation of the dust or <b>vapour</b> and <b>contamination</b> of the skin or clothing should be avoided. Good housekeeping and personal cleanliness are also very important in preventing absorption of MBOCA. THE FULL name of MBOCA (or MOCA*) is 3, 3 '-dicbJoro- 4, 4 '-diaminodiphenyl methane or methylene-bis-o-chloroaniline. Strict control and supervision must be observed when it is used in industry because, although no carcinogenic effects in humans have been substantiated, the available evidence is extremely suspicious. METHOD OF USE MBOCA {{is used in the}} manufacture of certain polyurethane products, particularl...|$|R
40|$|This report {{reviews the}} {{feasibility}} of detection of impurities, in particular water vapour, in natural gas, using real-time correlation spectroscopy. The general concept relies on using a gas sample, contained in a reference cell, as a matched optical filter, to preferentially detect similar absorption spectra of the same gas in the measurement cell. All variations of the method {{have the advantage of}} excellent selectivity, provided the gases to be detected have narrow line spectra, even when using broadband sources for illumination. They are also suitable for direct-path measurements or for remote detection over optical fibre leads. The report focuses on two main areas. Firstly, the Stark modulation method has been used to detect water and ammonia vapour. Secondly, we present an alternative correlation spectroscopic arrangement, in which the route of the light path is modulated. This new arrangement has been tested with both water vapour and ammonia. We give a comparison of the characteristics of both methods and discuss their suitability for determining water <b>vapour</b> <b>contamination</b> in natural gas. Our conclusions are that the switched-path method has some potential of being developed to meet the Shell application for trace measurement of water vapour in high-pressure natural gas...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that high voltage circuit {{breakers}} are able to work under short current conditions, too, they are the important security elements in electrical power systems. During the switching operation an electrical arc exists between the switching contacts. The operation method of all circuit breakers is to quench this electrical arc. In SF 6 self blast circuit breakers, which present the newest generation of high voltage circuit breakers, the arc burns within the insulating nozzles. The high temperature of the arc leads to an ablation of the nozzle material and to a resulting gas flow on the one hand in the direction of an outlet {{and on the other hand}} into a pressure chamber. This gas flow causes a pressure rise in the pressure chamber. Close to current zero the energy input in the insulating nozzle decreases, and thus the ablation decreases too. The stored gas in the pressure chamber is now able to flow backwards towards the arc into the outlet volume. Due {{to the fact}} of this intensive gas flow the arc cools down, and the current can be successfully interrupted. A successful interruption in a SF 6 circuit breaker does not only depend on the blow gas pressure, but also on the quenching gas composition. During the interrupting process the high temperature of the arc yields to an ablation of the switching contacts, too. This electrode ablation material can also be distributed to the pressure chamber of a SF 6 self blast circuit breaker and thereby influences the interrupting behaviour in a negative way. The aim of this thesis is to systematically investigate the influence of the ablated electrode material on the interrupting limits of SF 6 self blast circuit breakers. For that purpose a model breaker arrangement is developed to reproduce the behaviour of a self blast circuit breaker. For testing the model breaker arrangement with current densities of real circuit breakers, an appropriate test setup is designed. The investigation method allows measuring the ablation behaviour of the insulating nozzle and of the electrodes, the pressure build up in the pressure chamber and the interrupting behaviour of the model breaker. The concentration of ablated electrode material in the pressure chamber is provided by CFD-simulations, which includes a new electrode erosion model. The electrode <b>vapour</b> <b>contamination</b> of the quenching gas yields to a reduction of the interrupting limit of the model breaker. Compared to the unaffected case, already a relative contamination of around 0. 9 % reduces the interrupting limit by approximately 20 %. This depends not only on the contamination of the quenching gas, but also on the presence of electrode material in the arc zone. Therefore, a more intensive arc cooling by an existing electrode ablation contamination is required. It is demonstrated that the influence of the ablation of the electrodes on the interrupting behaviour can be reduced by an appropriately balanced proportion of the electrode surface to the insulation nozzle surface...|$|E
40|$|More than a {{metric ton}} {{of water is}} transported to the International Space Station (ISS) each year to provide {{breathing}} oxygen for the astronauts. Water is a safe and compact form of stored oxygen. The water is electrolyzed on ISS and ambient pressure oxygen is delivered to the cabin. A much smaller amount of oxygen is used each year in spacesuits to conduct Extra Vehicular Activities (EVAs). Space suits need high pressure (> 1000 psia) high purity oxygen (must meet Aviator Breathing Oxygen "ABO" specifications, > 99. 5 % O 2). The water / water electrolysis system cannot directly provide high pressure, high purity oxygen, so oxygen for EVAs is transported to ISS in high pressure gas tanks. The tanks are relatively large and heavy, {{and the majority of}} the system launch weight is for the tanks and not the oxygen. Extracting high purity oxygen from cabin air and mechanically compressing the oxygen might enable on-board production of EVA grade oxygen using the existing water / water electrolysis system. This capability might also benefit human spaceflight missions, where oxygen for EVAs could be stored in the form of water, and converted into high pressure oxygen on-demand. Cerium oxide solid electrolyte-based ion transport membranes have been shown to separate oxygen from air, and a supported monolithic wafer form of the CeO 2 electrolyte membrane has been shown to deliver oxygen at pressures greater than 300 psia. These supported monolithic wafers can withstand high pressure differentials even though the membrane is very thin, because the ion transport membrane is supported on both sides (Fig 1). The monolithic supported wafers have six distinct layers, each with matched coefficients of thermal expansion. The wafers are assembled into a cell stack which allows easy air flow across the wafers, uniform current distribution, and uniform current density (Fig 2). The oxygen separation is reported to be "infinitely selective" to oxygen [1] with reported purity of 99. 99 % [2]. Combined with a mechanical compressor, a Solid Electrolyte Oxygen Separator (SEOS) should be capable of producing ABO grade oxygen at pressures > 2400 psia, on the space station. Feasibility tests using a SEOS integrated with a mechanical compressor identified an unexpected contaminant in the oxygen: water vapour was found in the oxygen product, sometimes at concentrations higher than 40 ppm (the ABO limit for water vapour is 7 ppm). If solid electrolyte membranes are really "infinitely selective" to oxygen as they are reported to be, where did the water come from? If water is getting into the oxygen, what other contaminants might get into the oxygen? Microscopic analyses of wafers, welds, and oxygen delivery tubes were performed in an attempt to find the source of the water <b>vapour</b> <b>contamination.</b> Hot and cold pressure decay tests were performed. Measurements of water vapour as a function of O 2 delivery rate, O 2 delivery pressure, and process air humidity levels were the most instructive in finding the source of water contamination (Fig 3). Water contamination was directly affected by oxygen delivery rate (doubling the oxygen production rate cut the water level in half). Water was affected by process air humidity levels and delivery pressure in a way that indicates the water was diffusing into the oxygen delivery system...|$|E
40|$|A {{facility}} for studying electron transport parameters {{in a given}} gas mixture is illustrated. A controlled ionization is induced by means of multiple-photon processes by focussing a short (~ 1 ns) pulsed nitrogen laser in the gas gap. The test gas volume, where a suitable E-field is applied, is installed on a micrometric motion system which allows to accurately scan the volume (resolution ~ 3 mu m) with a beam focus waist {{of the order of}} 10 mu m. Such a facility has been used for measurements of the gas parameters of the He drift chamber of KLOE experiment at DA Phi NE and for preliminary measurements of gain and attachment coefficients in the binary mixtures (C/sub 2 /H/sub 2 /F /sub 4 /+ 3 %, 10 % iso C/sub 4 /H/sub 10 /) planned for the ATLAS and CMS RPC systems. An upgraded version of the set-up, which allows also for O/sub 2 / and H/sub 2 /O <b>vapour</b> controlled <b>contamination,</b> is currently being used for measurements on ternary mixtures (C/sub 2 /H/sub 2 /F /sub 4 /+iso C/sub 4 /H/sub 10 /+SF/sub 6 /).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{three different}} liquid valving methods for the centrifugal microfluidic platform, namely vacuum/compression wax valve, passive liquid valve (PLV), and check valve. The {{mechanism of the}} proposed valves is simply based on sequencing the liquid flow by controlling air-flow inside the microfluidic network. Specifically, the wax valve and passive liquid valve utilize a volume of trapped air in the source chamber or the destination chamber to control the burst frequency of the liquid. In contrast, the check valve controls {{the direction of the}} air to control the flow direction of the pumped liquid. Compared with the previously proposed valves, this mechanism prevents any direct contact between the valving materials and the sample/reagents. This will reduce the chance of sample/reagents contamination, and allow the use of wider range of valving materials. As a proof of concept, liquid metering, liquid switching, and liquid swapping are conducted using the proposed valving methods. Furthermore, Bradford assay for protein concentration detection, and enzyme linked-immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for dengue are demonstrated to show the capability of the developed valves to perform biomedical applications. The results illustrate that the valves reduce the required spinning frequency to perform the microfluidic processes on the centrifugal platforms. In addition, the presence of physical barriers improves the ability of the developed valves to reduce <b>vapour</b> and <b>contamination</b> effect. Furthermore, the proposed valves show additional advantages such as the simplicity of fabrication and implementation, reversibility and multi-actuation, and compatibility with biomedical applications. Finally, the demonstration of the ELISA and the Bradford assays illustrate the ability of the presented valves to be integrated in any multistep biomedical and chemical application on the centrifugal microfluidic platform...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of small-molecule organic {{solar cells}} based on coper-phthalocyanine/fullerene with different cathode buffer layer is investigated {{as a function}} of air exposure duration. We present the study of the effect of MoO 3 on the properties of photovoltaic solar cells (OPVCs) when it is introduced in the cathode buffer layer (CBL). Photovoltaic performances were measured {{as a function of}} time of air exposure. During the first days of air exposure the efficiency of the OPVCs with MoO 3 in their CBL increases significantly, while it decreases immediately after air exposure in the case of reference OPVCs, i. e. without MoO 3 in the CBL. Nevertheless, the lifetime of the OPVCs with MoO 3 in their CBL is around 60 days, while it is only 10 days in the case of reference OPVCs. The initial increase of the OPVC with MoO 3 in their CBL is attributed to the slow decrease of the work function of MoO 3 due to progressive contamination. Then, the progressive degradation of the OPVCs efficiency is due water <b>vapour</b> and oxygen <b>contamination</b> of the organic layers. The use of a double CBL, Alq 3 /MoO 3, allows to interrupt the growth of pinholes, defects and increases the path of permeating gas. Also it can prevent the contamination of the organic layer by Al. All this results in significant increase of the lifetime of the OPVCs...|$|R
40|$|Executive summary Dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) such as creosote, coal tar, {{chlorinated}} solvents and polychlorinated biphenyl oils represent a particular class {{of soil and}} groundwater contaminant that exist as a separate liquid phase {{in the presence of}} water. DNAPLs come to rest in the subsurface as disconnected blobs and ganglia of liquid referred to as residual DNAPL, and in potentially mobile distributions referred to as pools. The region of the subsurface containing residual and pooled DNAPL {{is referred to as the}} source zone. Groundwater flowing through the source zone slowly dissolves the DNAPL, giving rise to aqueous phase plumes of contamination hydraulically down-gradient of the source zone. Some DNAPL compounds are resistant to biodegradation and sorb little; they can therefore give rise to substantial aqueous phase plumes. Other DNAPL compounds are relatively immobile in groundwater and, therefore, are highly retarded relative to the rate of groundwater flow. In unsaturated media, volatile DNAPLs give rise to <b>vapour</b> phase <b>contamination.</b> Because DNAPLs are only slightly soluble in water, DNAPL source zones can persist for many decades and, in some cases, even hundreds of years. Some DNAPLs are highly toxic and even very low concentrations in groundwater or the atmosphere can pose an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. The fact that DNAPLs are denser than water allows them to migrate to substantial depths below the water table in both unconsolidated deposits and fractured bedrock. Delineating the spatial extent of the DNAPL source zone at a site can be a substantial undertaking, requiring at times several years of investigation and significant financial resources. Remediation strategies are site-specific, with separate approaches often warranted for the DNAPL source zone and its associated aqueous phase plume. There has been limited success in removing all DNAPL from below the water table at sites, particularly in a fractured rock environment. Remediation strategies are therefore often directed towards source zone containment or stabilisation, partial mass removal, plume management or plume interception, within the framework of appropriate risk-management objectives. The purpose of this handbook is to provide a user-friendly overview of the nature of DNAPL contamination in a UK context. It is intended to assist site investigators, site owners and regulators in conducting site investigations, conducting risk assessments and selecting remediation approaches. While this handbook reflects the state-of-the-art at the time of publication, it should be noted that the discipline of groundwater and soil contamination by hazardous organic liquids is evolving continuously and is relatively ‘young’ compared with many other areas of science and engineering. Readers are therefore advised to keep abreast of the new advances in understanding and approaches expected in the foreseeable future...|$|R
