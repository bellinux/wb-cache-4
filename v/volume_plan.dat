40|$|The {{international}} data on {{tidal prism}} and cross-sectional area of tidal inlets and estuaries are examined {{as a basis}} for exploring the variability in the comparable UK data. The data are then used to evaluate the existing classification of estuary types; to present a number of relationships between the key bulk parameters of estuary <b>volume,</b> <b>plan</b> area, and cross-sectional area; and to test some theoretically derived relationships. The results suggest that the degree of Holocene sedimentation, and hence Holocene development, may explain much of the variability seen in the data, and this is not, as yet, fully accounted for in the theoretical relationship...|$|E
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} ability to {{integrate}} scheduling and lot-sizing decisions within the semi-process industry. The production model corresponds with the production process of Agfa, a photographic film producer. The manufacturing model is typically semi-process, where a first stage produces {{a limited number of}} intermediate products. The second stage is flow-shop-oriented and converts the intermediates into many distinct end products. The planning approach corresponds with two-level scheduling. A tactical <b>volume</b> <b>plan</b> is established at the intermediate product level, which is then used as an input constraint for the secondary problem, determining the end-product lot sizes. These end-product mix decisions are governed by a tuned fair share algorithm. This article researches the possibilities of migrating the fair share algorithm from a distribution environment towards a capacity constrained production environment and the results are compared with the traditional model based on standard economic order quantity lot sizing. This article proposes a tuned algorithm with its parameter settings and discusses the impacts on stock values, service levels and set-up and inventory holding costs. The simulation results prove that the combination of a tactical <b>volume</b> <b>plan,</b> at the intermediate product level, combined with fair share mix decisions for the end-product lot sizes, delivers a more robust planning model. The main benefit of the model integrating volume planning and mix decisions is {{the ability to}} reduce demand amplifications, prohibiting market demand nervousness from entering into upstream operations, which allows a major reduction in needed safety stock at the intermediate product level...|$|E

The economico-mathematical methods, mathematical programming and mathematical statistics hardware have been used in the investigation. Developed have been the complex of models and algorithms of its realization allowing to form the calendar-grounded tasks for a month for the machining complexes. The suggested methods of formation of the volume-calendar tasks widen the possibilities of using the economico-mathematical modeling in the workstation of the workshop control personnel.

40|$|The {{relevance}} {{of this problem}} is primarily determined by a necessity of improving production efficiency in conditions of innovative development {{of the economy and}} implementation of Import Substitution Program. The purpose of the article is development of set of criteria and procedures for the comparative assessment of alternative volume production plans and choice of optimum alternative. The leading method of the study of the problem is economic-mathematical modeling, providing the variability of <b>volume</b> <b>plan</b> development on the basis of different factors and variables, which reflect actual operating standards of a particular study subject. The results of the study: In the article, economic-mathematical model for development of aggregate production plan was presented, on the basis of which alternatives was produced, estimated figures, characterizing efficiency of derived alternatives, were justified, the key factors, which determine a specific set of variables and constraints, were considered. The article materials can be useful for experts, which are specialized in planning of production and distribution of the production program in choosing optimum alternative of aggregate production plan. © 2016 Brazhnikov et al...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{development}} and implementation of, a sales forecasting model, by pack size, category, channel, region, customer account and a Web-based decision support system (DSS) for consumer packaged goods. In addition to capturing the effects of such variables as past sales, trend, own and competitor prices and promotional variables, and seasonality, the model accounts for the effects of temperature, significant holidays, new product introductions, trading day corrections, and adjustments to the wholesale level. In general, the model forecasts sales volume satisfactorily for a leading consumer packaged goods company. The DSS enables top- and mid-level executives in sales, marketing, strategic planning, and finance to develop accurate forecasts of sales <b>volume,</b> <b>plan</b> prices, and promotional activities over a long time horizon; to track sales response to marketing actions over time; and to simulate forecast scenarios based on possible marketing decisions and other variables. is being rolled out for more users and more divisions in the company. The key take-aways are that successful development and implementation of a rigorous marketing science model require a strong internal champion, a careful balance between modeling sophistication and practical relevance, good diagnostic features, regular validations, and greater attention {{to the development of a}} fast and responsive DSS. forecasting, econometric models, channels, decision support system, marketing mix, pricing, promotions, strategic planning...|$|E

The legal part described: the building's legal regulation, principal demands {{of the building and}} architecture, main documents required for the construction of the building and their issue order, technical maintenance, construction participants and their activities. The architectural part presented collective data about the building under construction and it's site. Defined: structure of the building's <b>volume,</b> <b>plan</b> and construction. Calculated: the heat transfer coefficient of roof construction. Bonded wood beam is calculated and designed. Four swimming pool shell roof bearing structures and coating selection versions are created in the research part. Criteria are selected for multi-criteria evaluation, which is done by using optimization methods and afterwards one optimal version. Most rational roof constructions and roof combination is designed in the technologic part. All necessary mechanisms are selected. Technological card of this process is created. Construction site plan created in the organizational part. Crane for lifting is selected. Location of local warehouses, buildings and engineering networks are described. The economic part presented calculations of the whole building to carry out the construction and its estimated price. Health and safety requirements are described. At the end of the work, conclusions are given. Scope of work - 86 pages, 19 illustrations, 45 tables, 65 formulas and 8 drawings (in A 1 format) ...|$|E
