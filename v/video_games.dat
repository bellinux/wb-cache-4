According to Iwiński, {{although}} he enjoyed playing <b>video</b> <b>games</b> as a child they were scarce in Poland (which was in the Soviet Union's sphere of influence at the time). Polish copyright law did not exist and Iwiński, in high school, sold cracked copies of Western <b>video</b> <b>games</b> at a Warsaw marketplace. In high school Iwiński met Kiciński, who became his business partner; at that time, Kiciński also sold <b>video</b> <b>games.</b>|$|E

40|$|Gaming {{addiction}} {{has become}} a topic of increasing research interest. The last decade has witnessed {{a significant increase in}} the number of empirical studies examining various aspects of problematic <b>video</b> <b>game</b> play and <b>video</b> <b>game</b> addiction. This paper begins with a brief past history of how research into <b>video</b> <b>game</b> addiction has changed over the last three decades (i. e., the 1980 s, 1990 s and 2000 s). It then examines more thoroughly the contemporary research literature by analyzing the (i) prevalence of problematic <b>video</b> <b>game</b> use and <b>video</b> <b>game</b> addiction, (ii) negative consequences of excessive <b>video</b> <b>game</b> use, (iii) factors associated with problematic <b>video</b> <b>game</b> use and <b>video</b> <b>game</b> addiction, and (iv) the treatment of problematic <b>video</b> <b>game</b> use and <b>video</b> <b>game</b> addiction. The paper concludes by looking at the trends in the field and a somewhat theoretical examination of what the future of <b>video</b> <b>game</b> addiction might be. Mark D. Griffiths, Daria J.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine associations between problem <b>video</b> <b>game</b> use and psychopathology. The <b>Video</b> <b>Game</b> Use Questionnaire (VGUQ) and the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL- 90) were administered in an international anonymous online survey. The VGUQ was used to identify problem <b>video</b> <b>game</b> users and SCL- 90 assessed dimensions of psychopathology. In comparison with other <b>video</b> <b>game</b> players (n[*]=[*] 1789), those with problem <b>video</b> <b>game</b> use (n[*]=[*] 156) had significantly elevated scores on all SCL- 90 subscales. When compared to the U. S. male nonpatients, a significantly greater proportion of male <b>video</b> <b>game</b> players exhibited higher levels of all psychopathology. These findings suggest that there is a non-specific relationship between various domains of psychopathology and <b>video</b> <b>game</b> use in general and problem <b>video</b> <b>game</b> use in particular. 9 page(s...|$|R
