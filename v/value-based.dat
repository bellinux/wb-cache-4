25|$|<b>Value-based</b> pricing: (also {{known as}} {{image-based}} pricing) occurs {{where the company}} uses prices to signal market value or associates price with the desired value position {{in the mind of}} the buyer. The aim of <b>value-based</b> pricing is to reinforce the overall positioning strategy e.g. premium pricing posture to pursue or maintain a luxury image.|$|E

25|$|A nationally {{recognized}} leader {{on health care}} policy, Altmire authored the legislation that ended the late enrollment penalty for low-income seniors participating in the Medicare Part D program, and he played a decisive role in preventing a proposed 2007 Medicare budget cut for hospitals. In 2008, he successfully led the effort to delay the Medicare durable medical equipment competitive bidding program, and in 2009, he introduced legislation that became the template for the hospital <b>value-based</b> purchasing demonstration project included as part the Affordable Care Act. Altmire was a key participant in the congressional debate {{on health care reform}} in 2009 and 2010. Because of his professional background in health care, his vote was sought after by both sides and he withstood heavy pressure from the White House and Democratic party leaders before voting against the bill on March 21, 2010.|$|E
500|$|A second {{method of}} [...] "grandfathering" [...] is to base {{allocations}} on current production of economic goods, rather than historical emissions. Under {{this method of}} allocation, government will set a benchmark level of emissions for each good deemed to be sufficiently trade exposed and allocate firms units based on their production of this good. However, allocating permits in proportion to output implicitly subsidises production. Garnaut considers that any method for free permit allocation will have the disadvantages of high complexity, high transaction costs, <b>value-based</b> judgements, {{and the use of}} arbitrary emissions baselines.|$|E
500|$|There {{has been}} debate on whether ethics {{should be taught}} in a {{university}} setting. Supporters point out that ethics {{are important to the}} profession, and should be taught to accountants entering the field. In addition, the education would help to reinforce students' ethical values and inspire them to prevent others from making unethical decisions. Critics argue that an individual is ethical or not, and that teaching an ethics course would serve no purpose. Despite opposition, instruction on accounting ethics by universities and conferences, has been encouraged by professional organizations and accounting firms. The Accounting Education Change Commission (AECC) has called for students to [...] "know and understand the ethics of the profession and be able to make <b>value-based</b> judgments." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{academics}} claim cost-effectiveness {{research is}} a valuable <b>value-based</b> measure of innovation which accords [...] "truly significant" [...] therapeutic advances (i.e. providing [...] "health gain") higher prices than free market mechanisms. Such <b>value-based</b> pricing has been viewed {{as a means of}} indicating to industry the type of innovation that should be rewarded from the public purse.|$|E
2500|$|The SEC is {{removing}} the valuation exemption that permitted these funds (whose investors historically {{have made the}} heaviest redemptions in times of stress) to maintain a stable NAV, i.e., {{they will have to}} transact sales and redemptions as a market <b>value-based</b> or [...] "floating" [...] NAV, rounded to the fourth decimal place (e.g., $1.0000).|$|E
2500|$|Cheap imports {{may also}} cause {{the failure of}} local firms {{providing}} similar goods at higher prices, and hence unemployment but [...] MMT commentators label that consideration as a subjective <b>value-based</b> one, rather than an economic-based one: {{it is up to}} a nation to decide whether it values the benefit of cheaper imports more than it values employment in a particular industry. Similarly a nation overly dependent on imports may face a supply shock if the exchange rate drops significantly, though central banks can and do trade on the FX markets to avoid sharp shocks to the exchange rate.|$|E
2500|$|Payments {{for better}} care {{coordination}} between home, hospital and offices {{for patients with}} chronic illnesses. In April 2005, CMS launched its first <b>value-based</b> purchasing pilot or [...] "demonstration" [...] project- the three-year Medicare Physician Group Practice (PGP) Demonstration. The project involves ten large, multi-specialty physician practices caring for more than 200,000 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. Participating practices will phase in quality standards for preventive care and the management of common chronic illnesses such as diabetes. Practices meeting these standards {{will be eligible for}} rewards from savings due to resulting improvements in patient management. The First Evaluation Report to Congress in 2006 showed that the model rewarded high quality, efficient provision of health care, but the lack of up-front payment for the investment in new systems of case management [...] "have made for an uncertain future with respect for any payments under the demonstration." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Chamberlain became more pessimistic in his conclusions, believing that notions about union-management {{collaboration}} would have scant impact on the corporation's ability to react to external events. [...] He also grew dissatisfied with the development of economic analysis, believing it too formal and beholden to quantitative methods and lacking a <b>value-based</b> look at how corporate management behaved. [...] Indeed, Chamberlain became skeptical about his discipline as a whole. [...] In the context of a 1980 New York Times piece about the hazards of poorly conducted social science research, he was quoted as saying, [...] "We know very little about what we profess to know. We have claimed too much as a profession." [...] He came to have philosophical doubts about the entire study of economics, believing that purposeful action, unforeseen trends, and random occurrences combine to give economic theories that are based upon the observation of what has taken place in the past little predictive ability or policy-making usefulness in terms of what will take place in the future.|$|E
