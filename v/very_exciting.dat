5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's <b>very</b> <b>exciting</b> for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E

25|$|This win was <b>very</b> <b>exciting</b> as {{once again}} Papatoetoe were Ellerslie's main rival with only 4.28 points {{separating}} {{the two teams}} going into the last match of the season but an outright victory over University saw Ellerslie through to its first major premiership title.|$|E

25|$|Wild's team {{associated}} type III bursts with {{streams of}} electrons being ejected at a third {{the speed of}} light and taking less than half an hour to reach the Earth. There remained a few sceptics about this interpretation until, a decade or so later, American physicists using satellite data regularly detected bursts of electrons 25 minutes or so after solar flares. This was just one component, but to Wild and his colleagues a <b>very</b> <b>exciting</b> one, of a much wider world-leading research program.|$|E
25|$|This match had a <b>very</b> <b>exciting</b> climax. When time ran out, England {{were six}} runs {{short of the}} 234 {{that they needed to}} win. The ninth wicket fell when Derek Shackleton was run out from the fourth ball of the final over. Colin Cowdrey had had his left arm broken earlier in the innings, and had retired hurt. Now he reappeared, with his arm in plaster. Luckily for him, and for England, he was not {{required}} to face a ball, David Allen playing out the remaining two deliveries.|$|E

25|$|After the {{verdicts}} penalized numerous clubs, Palermo's overall position for that season was elevated to fifth, meaning they had {{qualified for the}} 2006–07 UEFA Cup. In the transfer window, Palermo spent millions adding players to their squad, including Aimo Diana, Mark Bresciano, Fábio Simplício and Amauri, but sold World Cup winner Fabio Grosso to Internazionale. The events led several football pundits to tip Palermo {{to do well in}} the season ahead. A <b>very</b> <b>exciting</b> start saw Palermo sitting on top of the Serie A table in September 2006 after beating Catania 5-3 at home in the Sicilian derby. Another notable victory was a 2-0 away win to AC Milan at San Siro stadium. The team started well also in the UEFA Cup by knocking out West Ham United. However, this time around the group stage proved to be more difficult than the previous year, and Palermo finished last in a group that contained Celta de Vigo, Eintracht Frankfurt, Fenerbahçe SK and Newcastle United.|$|E
25|$|The Fourth Test at Old Trafford proved decisive. It was won by Australia by 54 runs. The {{last day}} was <b>very</b> <b>exciting,</b> seeing many turns of fortune. England had managed a first innings lead of 177. Australia's second innings had reached 331-6 {{at the close}} of the fourth day, a lead of 154. On the final morning, David Allen took 3 wickets quickly, {{reducing}} Australia to 334-9, and the game seemed won by England. But Davidson then took the attack to the bowlers, hitting Allen for 20 in an over, and with help from McKenzie added 98 for the last wicket. England needed 256 to win at 67 runs an hour. Ted Dexter, well supported by Raman Subba Row, scored 76 in 84 minutes and took England to 150-1, and strong favourites to win. But Benaud went round the wicket and aimed at the bowlers' footmarks, and caused a collapse. He finished with 6-70, and Australia won with 20 minutes to spare, thereby retaining The Ashes.|$|E
25|$|SIP, more {{explicitly}} DNA/RNA-based SIP, uses stable-isotope enriched substrates, such as 13C, 15N, or H218O, and then analyzes the 'labeled' markers using species specific DNA or RNA markers. The analysis of labeled DNA is performed by separating unlabeled and labeled DNA on a cesium chloride gradient formed in an ultra centrifuge. Because all microbial organisms {{are capable of}} importing water into their cells, the use of H218O stable isotope probing is a <b>very</b> <b>exciting</b> new method that can shed light on questions microbial ecologists and biologists have struggled with answering for years, in particular, what are the active microbial organisms in my system? The H218O, or heavy water method will target all organisms that are actively growing, and induce little influence on growth itself. This would be especially true with most greenhouse experiments with arbuscular mycorrhizas because plants must be watered anyway, and water does not directly select for organisms with specific metabolic pathways, as would happen when using 13C and15N.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{troublesome}} 1980 {{season with}} suspension from {{the league and}} {{a victory for the}} Mapua Cardinals, the Letran Knights started the 1982 season under the tutelage of new coach Coach Larry Albano which featured a <b>very</b> <b>exciting</b> player named Samboy Lim. Samboy Lim is a graduate of San Beda High School and also played for the San Beda Red Cubs (the Juniors Basketball team of San Beda). After sweeping the first round, the Knights continued to pile up victories in the second round and was two wins ahead of #2 ranked San Sebastian. The Knights were unofficially crowned champions but they still had to play Trinity College in a no-bearing game to officially finish their NCAA campaign. The Knights lost that game 102-89 but it didn't matter as the school's 7th trophy was still presented to them. In 1983, the heavily favored Samboy Lim and the Knights advanced to the championship round where they will meet Nani Demegillo and the San Sebastian Stags for the title. The championship game was decided on a best-of-3 series and both teams split the first two games but in Game 3 the Knights played inspired basketball due to Samboy Lim's heroic deed of choosing to play instead of resting in the hospital (he suffered an asthma attack in Game 2 and has to be sent in the hospital that night) and captured their 2nd straight championship. Romy Ang was named MVP of the season but Samboy Lim's heroics left an indelible impression to the hearts of those who witnessed it. With San Beda taking a leave of absence in 1984, the NCAA kicked off the season with only 5 schools participating but it didn't distract the Knights as they secured a date with history as the become the first school to finish the season undefeated and champions. Samboy Lim was named MVP of the season and RP Team patron Danding Cojuangco gave him a spot on the National Team roster.|$|E

500|$|It was {{announced}} on 17 July 2009 {{that the movie}} would be live action, with computer animated effects, and David Frankel as director and Rob Lieber to adapt Magyk. As of 2009, a re-write of the script was being done with screenwriter Mulroney while Warner Brothers were working with a studio to create some early conceptual design/look development. Sage commented: [...] "It is <b>very</b> <b>exciting</b> to know that others are putting their creative input into my work—quite amazing really.

500|$|Ellie Kendrick, who portrays Meera Reed, {{spoke about}} {{the writing of the}} episode {{following}} its airing, and revealed that she was surprised by the scene, saying [...] "When I was reading the episode, I completely forgot that I was a character in the show. I was reading it with such excitement, because this is a real story unfolding, with so many mysteries and quantum leaps and Inception-style traveling between the past and the present. I found it <b>very</b> <b>exciting.</b> So the first time I read it, I was just reading it for enjoyment, really, because it was so well-written and exciting. Once I picked my jaw up off the floor, I was really keen to get started working on it, because it's such an epic sequence." ...|$|E
500|$|Selman {{was pleased}} with the {{finished}} result of the episode. He noted in the interview with Grub Street that Marge starting to blog about food [...] "does not sound inherently exciting, but the episode itself is actually <b>very</b> <b>exciting,</b> and I'm super thrilled with the way it's turned out." [...] Selman thinks a strong thing about the episode is the fact that, despite Homer's love for food, Homer is not the one that becomes a foodie as one might expect. He explained that this is because although Homer loves eating, [...] "he's kind of a blue-collar kind of guy who doesn't like foreign food, weird food, savoring food, intellectualizing food, blogging about it, photographing it – he just wants to be stuffed all the time." ...|$|E

500|$|It was <b>very</b> <b>exciting.</b> I got {{to write}} the attack {{at the end of}} the episode—which was very much {{something}} that happened in the comic book series—so I knew I would be revisiting something I had already written. But as we were in the writers' room, when things started shifting which led to all this new stuff that wasn't in the comic book series, I thought that was great because it wasn't me writing the same-old same-old or rewriting something I had already done and trying to make it interesting for myself. It was really an entirely new story: getting the gang members in there and getting to write Daryl [...] which is one of my favorite characters on the show, despite the fact that he’s not in the comic book. It was a blast.|$|E
500|$|Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} with an A-; he praised the [...] "fine job" [...] of director/writer Akiva Goldsman, and thought the climax was [...] "extraordinarily well-shot and performed". IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9.2/10, writing that it [...] "is {{a classic example}} of a story you have to be patient with. This was an episode with a compelling, {{shocking}} start that kept us hooked well enough to deal with some slow points {{in the rest of the}} first half-hour. But we were rewarded for our patience with one heck of a climax and epilogue. This was well-executed TV". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times thought that while the first half wasn't <b>very</b> <b>exciting,</b> the second half had [...] "plenty to keep up interest" [...] as more was revealed about Olivia and Walter's backgrounds.|$|E
500|$|... "Bound" [...] {{was written}} by co-creators J.J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci, and {{executive}} producer Jeff Pinkner. Producer Frederick E. O. Toye worked as the director.

They're going to pull fluid out of her spine. It's creepy and weird. That's what we're going for, to try and set it up as a really awkward, horrible environment to be trapped in." [...] Toye and the crew {{wanted to make it}} [...] "as visually interesting and dramatic as possible," [...] and added in dripping water and [...] "creepy" [...] lighting to emphasize Olivia's [...] "terrible circumstances." [...] First assistant director Gary Rake noted that the episode [...] "took the character Olivia to a higher level... She's a lot more active, which is <b>very</b> <b>exciting</b> for us." ...|$|E
