40|$|The {{possible}} {{spread of}} late blight from volunteer potato plants requires {{the removal of}} these plants from arable fields. Because of high labour, energy, and chemical demands, a method of automatic detection and removal is needed. The development and comparison of two colour-based machine vision algorithms for in-field <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plant</b> detection in two sugar beet fields are discussed. Evaluation of {{the results showed that}} both methods gave closely matched results within fields, although large differences exist between the fields. At plant level, in one field up to 97 % of the volunteer potato plants were correctly classified. In another field, only 49 % of the volunteer plants were correctly identified. The differences between the fields were higher than the differences between the methods used for plant classification...|$|E
40|$|Viral {{diseases}} {{are among the}} most limiting factors in the production of potato in Colombia {{and the rest of the}} world. The best strategy to control plant viruses consists on the use of certified seed tubers, control of arthropod vectors and the use of adequate crop management practices that reduce mechanical transmission and the presence of viral reservoirs like weeds and volun-teer plants. However, the successful implementation of these practices relies on the availability of highly sensitive techniques that allow for the asymptomatic detection of viruses. In this work, we tested the performance of Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and real time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) on a single <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plant</b> (cv. Diacol-Capiro) growing naturally in a seed-tuber storage facility in Yarumal (Antioquia). Our NGS results demonstrate a mixed infection with Potato virus Y (PVY) and Potato leafroll virus (PLRV). RT-qPCR was performed in roots, main stolons, crown (root collar) and upper, middle and lower leaves using specific primers for PVY, PLRV, Potato virus S (PVS), Potato virus V (PVV), Potato virus X (PVX) and Potato yellow vein virus (PYVV). Only PVY and PLRV were detected in good agreement with the NGS data. This work demonstrates the use-fulness of both techniques for supporting integrated management of plant viruses in potato, in-cluding virus detection in natural reservoirs such as volunteer plants and weeds...|$|E

A joint effort of industry, {{policy makers and}} science initiated a four year scientific project on detection and control of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants.</b> A proof-of-principle machine for automated detection and control of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> in sugar beet fields has been tested in experimental fields. Machine vision-based detection at 100 mm 2 precision is combined with a micro-sprayer with five needles and a working width of 0. 2 m. The accuracy of the system was ± 14 mm in longitudinal direction and ± 7. 5 mm in transverse direction. The main error source was the variability in micro-sprayer droplet velocity that caused longitudinal errors. However, 77 % of volunteer plants with a size larger than 1200 mm 2 were successfully controlled at machine speeds up to 0. 8 m s- 1.

40|$|High {{amounts of}} manual labor {{are needed to}} control <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> in arable fields. Due to the high costs, this leads to {{incomplete}} control of these weed plants, and they spread diseases like Phytophthora infestans to other fields. This results in higher environmental loads by curative spraying of crop protection chemicals, which is in contradiction to the required decreased use of crop protection chemicals to save the environment. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis was “to develop a system for automated detection and control of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plants”. A systematic design approach was used to define a program of requirements and to identify and order possible solutions to accomplish the detection and control. The main requirements were a travel speed of up to 2 m s- 1, resolution of control at least 10 × 10 mm, work under variable natural light conditions, control of volunteer plants > 95 %, and undesired control of sugar beet plants < 5 %. The design strategy resulted in color and near-infrared machine vision as detection method and a micro-sprayer for application of glyphosate as a result. Furthermore, issues were identified that required further investigation to successfully come to a proof of principle machine. The research was then focused on: - Detection of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants,</b> - Control of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants,</b> - Real-time implementation of integrated detection and control on a proof of principle machine. For the purpose of detection of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants,</b> the narrow band spectral reflectance properties of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> and sugar beet plants were analyzed. Narrow band spectral measurements were done in 2006 and 2007 on two different fields. This resulted in 15 datasets on clay and sand soil. Discriminating wavebands were selected and classified with neural networks and statistical discriminant analysis. A neural network with two hidden neurons performed best for classification. Two sensors were used covering the range from 450 to 900 nm and from 900 to 1650 nm. Both visible and near infra-red wavebands were responsible for discrimination. From the analysis 450, 765, and 855 nm from sensor 1 and 900, 1440, and 1530 nm from sensor 2 were identified as important discriminative wavebands. However, the discriminative wavelengths depended on field and crop status {{and could not be}} generalized. Ten wavebands that were optimally adapted to the datasets gave 99 % true negative classification of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants.</b> On the other hand, a fixed set of three wavebands that was not adapted to the individual datasets gave 80 % true negative classification of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants.</b> This indicates that adaptive feature sets are required for classification. The development of the machine vision detection system started with measurements in 2005. Color based detection showed that the difference in classification results was larger between fields than the difference between a static neural network and static Bayesian classification. Then, machine vision measurements in 2006 with a color camera under changing and constant natural light conditions showed that crop and weed properties change within a field. An adaptive instead of static classification increased classification accuracy from 34. 9 % to 67. 7 % under changing light conditions. Under constant natural light conditions, the classification accuracy increased from 84. 6 % to 89. 8 %. So, adaptive classifiers are required and were implemented in the further research as these gave significantly higher classification results. As a next step, besides a color camera also a near-infrared camera was used for imaging within the proof of principle machine, as this gave a better feature set for classification. Additionally, the field of view of the cameras was shielded and artificial light was used to maintain constant light conditions. For the real-time implementation, an unsupervised adaptive Bayesian classifier was used. The crop row position and crop row width were determined and a Kalman filter improved tracking of the rows, to adapt to the varying properties of the crop in the field. Data from between the crop rows was trained as the <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> class and data from within the crop row was trained as the sugar beet class. This resulted in good quality training data for the Bayes classifier. The system was unsupervised, as it learned and trained itself based on row recognition. The features that were used for training and classification were: blue, hue, saturation, excessive green, red minus blue, near-infrared and near-infrared difference vegetation index (NDVI). These feature values within the training data were continuously locally adapted, in two first-in-first-out buffers both with an area of 500 cm 2 for sugar beet and <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants.</b> Measurements were done on seven days in 2007 and 2008. The results showed a trade-off between the percentage of correct classified <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> and the percentage of misclassification of sugar beet plants. In one of the fields 96. 6 % <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> classification and 8. 0 % sugar beet misclassification was achieved. Connected to the detection system was a micro-sprayer that applied glyphosate in gel to the <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants.</b> Spraying gel through a micro-sprayer was innovative. This proved to work in the application of glyphosate on plants. As knowledge of the dose response of glyphosate on potato was outdated and could not be used for plant specific application, a dose-response study was done with flat fan nozzles on 120 <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> to determine the efficacy of glyphosate. The effect parameters tuber weight and photosynthesis activity were analyzed with log-logistic nonlinear regression methods. This resulted in an amount of 843 μg a. e. per plant for reduction of tuber weight and photosynthesis with 90 %. This amount was applied on plants with a height of 6. 1 ± 1. 39 cm and an area of 53. 3 ± 19. 6 cm 2. As glyphosate was to be applied with a micro-sprayer, the dose-response study was extended to 500 greenhouse grown <b>potato</b> <b>plants.</b> Five application methods were used: 1) flat fan water application, 2) flat fan gel application, 3) micro-sprayer low density distribution, 4) micro-sprayer medium density distribution, and 5) micro-sprayer high density distribution. As effect parameters again tuber weight, photosynthesis activity, and in addition shoot dry weight were used. They were analyzed with ANOVAs and box-plots. The micro-sprayer dense distribution with 3022 droplets m- 2 and 3. 3 mg per droplet had the best efficacy. The micro-sprayer controlled the <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> with less glyphosate compared to flat fan nozzles. Furthermore, it had a centimeter precision resolution and low risks of unwanted crop damage. With real-time hardware, machine vision detection and micro-sprayer were integrated to a proof of principle machine. A travel speed of 0. 8 m s- 1 was reached with the proof of principle machine and it had an approximated capacity of 2. 5 hrs ha- 1. This was the maximum that could be realized as the micro-sprayer valve actuation frequency was maximally 80 Hz. The image processing time for one image of 0. 2 m length was 195 ms. At this travel speed automated feedback systems on the operation of the system are required to support and replace human surveillance. Therefore, the Fréchet distance measure between multivariate distributions was introduced as quality indicator of classification performance. The Fréchet distance measure was significantly smaller when the classification performance was low, as identified on ground truth determined classification results afterwards. This proves that the performance could be predicted with a distance measure between multivariate distributions. In case of poor predicted classification performance, the application of glyphosate with the micro-sprayer can be halted to prevent unwanted crop damage and economic losses. The accuracy of application was ± 1. 4 cm in longitudinal direction and ± 0. 75 cm in transversal direction. During a field trial, up to 84 % of the volunteer plants were controlled with 1. 4 % unwanted controlled sugar beet plants. To sum up, within this research a proof of principle machine for automated detection and control of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> in sugar beet fields has successfully been developed. The system performed closely to the requirements that were set in the start-up of the project. The percentage of 95 % controlled <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> can be reached. On the other hand, the travel speed still has to be increased from 0. 8 m s- 1 to 2. 0 m s- 1. The system is an example of new technology that can be developed for practical applications {{to reduce the amount of}} required labor and to reduce the crop protection inputs for weed control in arable farming...|$|R
40|$|<b>Volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> is a {{perennial}} weed {{that is difficult}} to control in crop rotations. It was our objective to build a small, low-cost robot capable of detecting <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> in a cornfield and thus demonstrate the potential for automatic control of this weed. We used an electric toy truck as the basis for our robot. We developed a fast row-recognition algorithm based on the Hough transform and implemented it using a webcam. We developed an algorithm that detects the presence of a <b>potato</b> <b>plant</b> based on a combination of size, shape, and color of the green elements in an image and implemented it using a second webcam.

40|$|<b>Volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> is an {{increasing}} problem in crop rotations where winter temperatures are often not cold enough to kill tubers leftover from harvest.

In this research, an adaptive Bayesian classification method has been developed for classification of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> within a sugar beet crop. With use of ground truth images, the classification accuracy of the plants was determined. In the non-adaptive scheme, the classification accuracy was 84. 6 and 34. 9 % for the constant and changing natural light conditions, respectively. In the adaptive scheme, the classification accuracy increased to 89. 8 and 67. 7 % for the constant and changing natural light conditions, respectively.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the reflectance properties of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> and sugar beet and to assess the potential of separating sugar beet and <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> at different fields and in different years, using spectral reflectance characteristics. With the ImspectorMobile, vegetation reflection spectra were successfully repeatedly gathered in two fields, on seven days in 2 years that resulted in 11 datasets. Both in the visible and in the near-infrared reflection region, combinations of wavelengths were responsible for discrimination between sugar beet and <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants.</b> Two feature selection methods, discriminant analysis (DA) and neural network (NN), succeeded in selecting sets of discriminative wavebands, both for the range of 450 – 900 and 900 – 1650 nm. First, 10 optimal wavebands were selected for each of the 11 available datasets individually. Second, by calculating the discriminative power of each selected waveband, 10 fixed wavebands were selected for all 11 datasets analyses. Third, 3 fixed wavebands were determined for all 11 datasets. These three wavebands were chosen because these had been selected by both DA and NN and were for sensor 1 : 450, 765, and 855 nm and for sensor 2 : 900, 1440, and 1530 nm. With the resulting three sets of wavebands, classifications were performed with a DA, a neural network with 1 hidden neuron (NN 1) and a neural network with two hidden neurons (NN 2). The maximum classification performance was obtained with the near-infrared sensor coupled to the NN 2 method with an optimal adapted set of 10 wavebands, where the percentages were 100 ± 0. 1 and 1 ± 1. 3 % for true negative (TN) classified <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> and false negative (FN) classified sugar beet plants respectively. In general the NN 2 method gave the best classification results, followed by DA and finally the NN 1 method. When the optimal adapted waveband sets were generalized to a set of 10 fixed wavebands, the classification results were still at a reasonable level of a performance at 87 % TN and 1 % FN for the NN 2 classification method. However, when a further reduction and generalization was made to 3 fixed wavebands, the classification results were poor with a minimum performance of 69 % TN and 3 % FN for the NN 2 classification method. So, these results indicate that for the best classification results it is required that the sensor and classification system adapt to the specific field situation, to optimally discriminate between <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> and sugar beet pixel spectr...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is {{the fourth}} major crop of the world after rice, wheat and maize. In Ethiopia, the yield per unit area of potato is very low {{compared}} {{to those of other}} countries. There are many factors that reduce the yield of the crop among which the diseases like late blight (Phytophthora infestans) and bacterial wilt (Ralstonia (Pseudomonas) solanacearum) which play an important role. Management of these diseases is therefore very essential. In Ethiopia, however, much research has not been done for the management of bacterial wilt disease except identification of bacteria and screening of biological control agents and use of resistant varieties. Late blight of potato can be managed using the following management (control) strategies: use of biological control agents, use of resistant varieties, intercropping, use of certified disease-free seed, use of selective fungicides and cultural practices such as destruction of cull piles by freezing or deep burying, destruction of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> in nearby fields throughout the season, destruction (desiccate, disc or flail and desiccate) of infected plants to avoid spread, reduction of periods of leaf wetness and high humidity within the crop canopy by appropriately timing irrigation, application of a recommended fungicide spray program (the program should start prior to the arrival of the pathogen) and desiccation of vines prior to harvest...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of oospores of Phytophthora infestans was studied in tomato and <b>potato</b> crops and <b>volunteer</b> <b>plants</b> under field conditions, and in laboratory tests with leaf discs of potato cultivars differing in {{their level of}} race-nonspecific resistance. Oospores were readily detected in blight-affected tomato leaflets and fruits, and in leaflets of field crops and <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants.</b> Oospores extracted from blighted potato leaflets yielded 13 oospore-derived progeny. Oospores were also produced following inoculation of leaf discs of eight potato cultivars expressing different levels of race-nonspecific resistance {{with a mixture of}} sporangia of A 1 and A 2 isolates. The highest numbers of oospores were produced in cvs Bintje (susceptible) and Pimpernel (resistant), and the lowest in Nicola (intermediate resistance). The relationship between lesions per leaflet and oospore incidence, affected by varying A 1 : A 2 ratios, was explored using a simple mathematical model, and validated by comparing actual oospore production in leaflets with multiple lesions of the race-nonspecific-resistant potato clone Lan 22 - 21 with the predictions generated by the model. Survival of oospores was investigated after their incorporation in either a sandy or a light clay soil in buried clay pots exposed to the local weather conditions. Over 6 years these soils were regularly assessed for their infection potential using floating leaflets in a spore-baiting bioassay. Sandy and clay soils contaminated with oospores remained infectious for 48 and 34 months, respectively, when flooded. Infections of floating potato leaflets occurred within 84 - 92 h and ceased after 11 days. Soil samples remained infective if dried and re-flooded on two, but not more, occasions...|$|R
40|$|Rhizoctonia solani causes disease on potato crops world-wide. Previous {{research}} {{showed that}} various anastomosis groups (AGs) caused disease on <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> in two regions that supply the fresh washed industry in South Australia. However, the AGs of this pathogen {{and their impact}} on other potato growing regions of Australia, particularly those that supply the processing industry, was unknown. R. solani was isolated from commercial crops and <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> in south-eastern South Australia, Kangaroo Island and Tasmania between 2005 and 2007. Both microscopy and AG-specific polymerase chain reaction assays were used to assign the resulting R. solani isolates to AGs. The main AGs found in potato fields, in all three Australian regions, were AG 2 - 1, AG 2 - 2 and AG 3. Isolates from all three AGs were associated with disease on root, stolon, stem and tuber tissues of <b>potato</b> <b>plants.</b> Isolates representative of the main AGs found in Australian fields were used in further experiments. The pathogenicity of selected isolates to potato was investigated. Disease severity was assessed on mature plants in experiments conducted in a shade-house and on potato sprouts grown in a controlled environment. AG 3 caused more sclerotia on tubers than did the other AGs but all three AGs were associated with stem, stolon and root necrosis. Variation in the severity of symptoms was observed among isolates from the same group. For example, inoculation of <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> with one AG 2 - 1 isolate resulted in deep necrotic lesions on stems, however, inoculation with two other isolates from the same group produced no or minor lesions on stems. Current control of Rhizoctonia disease relies on fungicides applied to seed tubers and/or soil at planting. With the aim of optimising fungicide use, the sensitivity of selected Australian isolates to one new and six commercially available fungicides was tested in vitro and in vivo. At the highest concentration tested most fungicides inhibited mycelial growth of the majority of isolates by over 80 %. However, some isolates exhibited fungicide insensitivity. For example, two AG 2 - 1 isolates were insensitive to an iprodione fungicide in vitro. The control of disease symptoms on <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> by fungicides also differed. The azoxystrobin fungicide significantly reduced stem necrosis caused by AG 2 - 1 and tuber sclerotia caused by AG 3 in planta, however, the other fungicides tested were less effective. These findings indicate that fungicide application may be tailored to manage specific AGs and disease symptoms. In other crops, such as medic and wheat, disease severity caused by R. solani is increased in micronutrient-deficient conditions. The influence of micronutrients, specifically zinc, on the susceptibility of <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> to Rhizoctonia disease was investigated. This was explored in a shade-house and a glass-house experiment by growing <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> in soil in which zinc had been incorporated at four different rates. In both a preliminary shade-house and subsequent glass-house experiment, the concentration of zinc in the stem tissue increased with increasing soil concentration of zinc. Assessment of disease severity was not possible in the preliminary experiment due to early senescence of plants. During a secondary experiment the increased tissue concentrations of zinc were associated with decreased stem necrosis of AG 2 - 1 -inoculated plants after 30 days, however, this was not reflected in AG 3 -inoculated plants. At harvest, disease severity could not be linked with zinc concentration due to variation in tissue content of other nutrients. Effective management of Rhizoctonia disease is essential to produce optimum yield in terms of both quantity and quality of potato tubers. Advances in AG-specific detection of inoculum, prior to planting, provide the opportunity to refine management practices for Rhizoctonia disease, based on observations that AGs may respond differently to some management strategies, such as chemical treatments. The association of AG with Rhizoctonia disease symptoms will allow further investigation of environmental factors that influence symptom severity, including the influence of micronutrients on tolerance of <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> to Rhizoctonia disease.

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> Solanum tuberosum L., cutleaf nightshade, S. triflorum N., and hairy nightshade, S. physalifolium Rusby (Solanales: Solanaceae), throughout potato crop rotations can diminish {{the effectiveness of}} crop rotations designed to control disease and pest problems associated with growing potatoes. In greenhouse bioassays, larvae of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) were placed in population densities of 0, 5, 10, and 40 per potato (cv. Russet Burbank) plant and 0, 5, 10, and 15 per cutleaf nightshade and hairy nightshade plant. Plants were treated with different rates of herbicides including fluroxypyr, prometryn, and mesotrione rates, and the physiological response on the <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> was assessed by weighing shoot biomass 14 days after treatment. Consistently, across all bioassays, rate response functions were shifted as L. decemlineata density increased, such that less herbicide was required to achieve control. For instance, the herbicide rate needed to achieve 90 % reduction in potato biomass was reduced from 62 to 0 g fluroxypyr per hectare and 711 to 0 g prometryn per hectare as L. decemlineata density was increased to 40 larvae per plant. Herbivory at higher L. decemlineata population densities and herbicides above certain rates resulted in large reductions in cutleaf and hairy nightshade biomass. Differences in rate response functions among L. decemlineata population densities indicated that L. decemlineata contributed to weed suppression in combination with herbicides. These data suggest that integrated weed management systems targeting <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato,</b> cutleaf nightshade, and hairy nightshade can be more effective when herbicide applications are combined with herbivory by naturally occurring Colorado potato beetles...|$|R

Transgenic tobacco and <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> were generated and established. These transgenic plants expressed the N protein of Puumala virus strain CG- 1820. No major differences were observed when the phenotype and growth rates of transgenic plants were compared to those of normal plants. However, it was found that the leaves of transgenic tobacco plants were more slender and the tubers of transgenic <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> were smaller than those in normal plants. In order to investigate the distribution of the expression of the foreign gene in transgenic plants, the proteins of leaves and roots of the individual transgenic tobacco and <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> were examined by Western blot analyses. It was found that all transgenic tobacco and <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> expressed the N protein in the leaves, whereas transgenic <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> are able to significantly express the viral proteins also in the tubers and roots.

The expression of viral proteins in plants has two major advantages compared to other expression systems: firstly, there is no risk of contamination with mammalian viruses or other pathogens, and secondly, the production of high amounts of antigens is cheap and therefore of great economic interest.

Beetles released between potato monocultures, polycultures with two additional non-host plant species, and polycultures with five additional non-host species, randomly colonized {{the three types of}} plots. Releases between different arrangements of potted host and non-host plants showed (1) greater beetle colonization and greater length of time spent on <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> growing alone than on <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> surrounded by non-host vegetation, and (2) no effect of <b>potato</b> <b>plant</b> density on colonization or tenure time. Overall, there was a 65 ~ recapture rate; beetles consistently stayed on the same plants they originally colonized, often for at least five days after release...|$|R

40|$|At low concentrations, Cu is {{considered}} {{as an essential}} micronutrient for plants and as a constituent and activator of several enzymes. However, when in excess, Cu can negatively affect plant growth and metabolism. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate physiological responses of sweet <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> at different Cu concentrations by measuring morphological parameters, antioxidant metabolism, stomatal characteristics, and mineral profile. For this purpose, sweet <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> were grown hydroponically in complete nutrient solution for six days. Then, the plants were transferred to solutions containing different Cu concentrations, 0. 041 (control), 0. 082, and 0. 164 mM, and maintained for nine days. The main effect of increased Cu concentration was observed in the roots. The sweet <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> grown in 0. 082 mM Cu solution showed increased activity of antioxidant enzymes and no changes in growth parameters. However, at a concentration of 0. 164 mM, Cu was transported from the roots to the shoots. This concentration altered morpho-anatomical characteristics and activated the antioxidant system because of the stress generated by excess Cu. On the basis of the results, it can be concluded that the sweet <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> were able to tolerate Cu toxicity until 0. 082 mM...|$|R

40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi (AMF) and Trichoderma spp. are {{soil microorganisms}} that increase growth and improve a/biotic stress resistance of numerous crop plants. So far, most studies on potato were conducted under greenhouse or in vitro conditions and few reported on results within the field. Therefore, the {{objective was to}} investigate the impact on potato yield of the co-inoculation of R. irregularis MUCL 41833 and T. harzianum MUCL 29707 applied to a cover crop (i. e. Medicago sativa) preceding <b>potato</b> <b>planting</b> or to <b>potato</b> at <b>planting.</b> Two macroplot trials were set up over two growing seasons with the cultivars Sarpo Mira and Bionta, respectively. In both trials, individual subplots were arranged in a randomized complete block design replicated four times. Microbial inoculants were entrapped in alginate beads. Four treatments were considered: inoculum applied to the cover crop preceding <b>potato</b> <b>planting</b> (I+CC+), inoculum applied on <b>potato</b> at <b>planting</b> and absence of a preceding cover crop – i. e. bare soil – (I+CC−), no inoculum applied either at cover crop preceding <b>potato</b> <b>planting</b> or on <b>potato</b> at <b>planting</b> (I−CC+), no inoculum applied on <b>potato</b> at <b>planting</b> and absence of a preceding cover crop – i. e. bare soil – (I−CC−). Potato yield (i. e. tuber weight, size and number) was evaluated in both trials. Potato root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and abundance of Trichoderma harzianum in soil were evaluated in trial 2. In both trials, the most advantageous strategy to increase potato tuber weight was by inoculating the cover crop. For cultivar Sarpo Mira (trial 1) inoculation increased significantly (P 30 mm long. Total root colonization by AMF and% arbuscules in potato roots was increased significantly (P < 0. 001) following inoculation but seemed not influenced by cover crop alone (i. e. without inoculation).
