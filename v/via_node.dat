50|$|For example, in {{the network}} given below, node A is {{transmitting}} data to node C <b>via</b> <b>node</b> B. If the link between nodes B and C goes down and B has not yet informed node A about the breakage, node A transmits the data to node B assuming that the link A-B-C is operational and of lowest cost. Node B knows of the broken link and tries to reach node C <b>via</b> <b>node</b> A, thus sending the original data back to node A. Furthermore, node A receives the data that it originated back from node B and consults its routing table. Node As routing table will say that it can reach node C <b>via</b> <b>node</b> B (because it still has not been informed of the break) thus sending its data back to node B creating an infinite loop.|$|E

Therefore, node 2 has a MAC address of 00:00:00:00:02:00. Node 2 is connected to node 7 (00:00:00:00:07:00) <b>via</b> <b>node</b> 2's interface/5.|$|E
50|$|According to the split-horizon rule, node A {{does not}} {{advertise}} its route for C (namely A to B to C) back to B. On the surface, this seems redundant since B will never route <b>via</b> <b>node</b> A because the route {{costs more than}} the direct route from B to C. However, if the link between B and C goes down, and B had received a route from A, B could end up using that route via A. A would send the packet right back to B, creating a loop. With the split-horizon rule in place, this particular loop scenario cannot happen, improving convergence time in complex, highly-redundant environments.|$|E

Consider the example in Fig. 1 (a), suppose node S 1 wants to transmit a packet P 1 to node D 1 <b>via</b> <b>node</b> C, while node S 2 wants to transmit P 2 to D 2 <b>via</b> <b>node</b> C. The dashed arrows S 1 �� � D 2 and S 2 �� � D 1 indicate that D 2, D 1 are within the transmission ranges of S 1, S 2 respectively. Therefore, D 1, D 2 can perform “opportunistic listening”: when S 1 (S 2) transmits P 1 (P 2) to node C, node D 2 (D 1) can overhear the transmission of P 1 (P 2). Without network coding, node C needs to transmit P 1 and P 2 separately. However, when one uses the XOR coding scheme, node C can broadcast an encoded packet (P 1 ⊕ P 2) to both D 1 and D 2, then D 1 can decode P 1 by performing P 2 ⊕ (P 1 ⊕ P 2), while D 2 can decode P 2 by performin...|$|E

Through this lens, the removal of relationships as a by-product of removing actors can be viewed as the essential act in disrupting a network <b>via</b> <b>node</b> removal. Furthermore, when the focus is on network fragmentation, deleting a particular actor might seem significant due to an increase in subcomponents. In contrast, an edge that serves as a local bridge may be more important to overall network communication efficiency, even though its deletion may not create any new subcomponents.|$|E

The scheme is implemented by a simple yet effective cross-layer design between the network and MAC layers. Extensive simulation results are presented to illuminate the distinguished performance of the proposed scheme...|$|E
30|$|The {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is to provide a proof of concept: it is possible to leverage the emergent properties of mobile ad hoc networks <b>via</b> <b>node</b> mobility and node cooperation to design a node capture detection protocol. To this aim, we use the Random Waypoint Mobility Model (RWM) [11], an ideal mobility model which is simple and general enough (at least for some application scenarios) to explore our ideas. Furthermore, the result on any particular mobility model should depend not only from the model but also from the network setting, as pointed out in [12] for the delay-capacity tradeoff. Indeed, providing specific settings and evaluations for other models is out of the scope of this work.|$|E

We automatically derive an element transfer function and finally a mesh optimization model using a formal analysis of the coefficients couplings in the finite element stiffness matrix, similar to the method, used in Algebraic Multigrid. Our mesh model is a transient dynamic system and proposed optimization can be also used for mesh deformation problems.
