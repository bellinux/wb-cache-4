40|$|In {{order to}} clarify whether the water {{treatment}} residual (WTR), i. e. an industrial waste, {{can be used}} as a plant growing medium or not, physicochemical properties of WTRs generated from two different water purification plants in Kitakyushu City in Japan were measured, and the growth of vegetables was experimented by using the WTRs to show the possible use of it as a plant growing medium. Komatsuna (Brassica rapa var. perviridis) was used as the <b>vegetable.</b> <b>Bark</b> compost (a soil conditioner) and/or phosphate (P) fertilizer were mixed to WTRs for improving its physicochemical properties. These mixture mediums were called cultivation soils. As a result, pH, and P absorption coefficient were not different between the WTRs and the cultivation soils. The pH, electric conductivity and effective cation exchange capacity of the cultivation soils were favorable, but the P absorption coefficient of the soils was too high for plant growth. Water–soluble and exchangeable manganese (Mn) concentrations of WTRs and cultivation soils differed largely between the two water purification plants. These Mn concentrations of the cultivation soils were high enough to cause Mn toxicity in plants. In the bark compost mixture soils, the water–soluble and exchangeable Mn concentrations were lower than those in the WTRs; the same characteristic of the Mn concentrations was also observed in the P fertilizer mixture soils. Concerning the vegetable growth experiment, almost no vegetables grew by using only the WTRs, and a positive effect of bark compost and P fertilizer mixtures on the vegetable growth was recognized. Mixtures of bark compost and/or P fertilizer to WTRs are, therefore, required for use WTRs as the plant growing medium...|$|E
50|$|Rhizophora mucronata has {{multiple}} uses. It {{is used to}} help prevent coastal erosion and in restoration of mangrove habitats. The timber is used for firewood and {{in the construction of}} buildings, as poles and pilings, and in making fish traps. The fruits can be cooked and eaten or the juice extracted to make wine, and the young shoots can be consumed as a <b>vegetable.</b> The <b>bark</b> is used in tanning and a dye can be extracted from both bark and leaves. Various parts of the plant are used in folk medicine.|$|R
50|$|Polposipus herculeanus, the Frégate Island giant tenebrionid beetle or Frégate beetle, is a flightless {{species of}} beetle in family Tenebrionidae. It is endemic to Frégate Island in the Seychelles. It grows {{to be about}} 20-30 mm long and has a hard, rounded abdomen covered with tubercles. There {{appears to be no}} sexual dimorphism. They are largely arboreal, {{sheltering}} under the bark of trees, beneath the crooks of branches, and within bushes during the day. They are believed to be nocturnal, descending to the forest floor at night, though never travelling far. This behaviour may help them to avoid predators such as the Wright's Skink and the Seychelles magpie-robin. When in danger, chemicals will secrete from the defensive glands in the posterior of the beetle, which have a musky smell and stains the skin purple. In captivity they have been noted to eat a variety of fruits, <b>vegetables,</b> <b>bark,</b> fungus and cat food. There are a few captive populations, taken for conservation reasons, the largest being at London zoo. These populations are the descendants of two small populations taken from the wild several years apart. It is quite possible that it previously lived on other islands in the Seychelles, and {{it has been suggested that}} it could be reintroduced to other islands to reduce its vulnerability. In captivity they have been recorded to live for up to seven years.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} to optimum biofilter operation is maintaining proper moisture throughout the system. The air is normally humidified before it enters the bed with a watering (spray) system, humidification chamber, bioscrubber, or biotrickling filter. Properly maintained, a natural, organic packing media like peat, <b>vegetable</b> mulch, <b>bark</b> or wood chips may last for several years but engineered, combined natural organic and synthetic component packing materials will generally last much longer, up to 10 years. A number of companies offer these types or proprietary packing materials and multi-year guarantees, not usually provided with a conventional compost or wood chip bed biofilter.|$|R

It is a rule of the parade that all surfaces of the float framework must be covered in natural materials (such as flowers, plants, seaweeds, seeds, <b>bark,</b> <b>vegetables,</b> or nuts, for example); furthermore, no artificial flowers or plant material are allowed, nor can the materials be artificially colored. Last-minute volunteer opportunities are usually available.|$|R
40|$|Flavonoids, a {{group of}} natural {{substances}} with variable phenolic structures, are found in fruits, <b>vegetables,</b> grains, <b>bark,</b> roots, stems, flowers, tea and wine. These natural products are well known for their beneficial effects on health and efforts are being made to isolate the ingredients so called flavonoids. Flavonoids are now considered as an indispensable component {{in a variety of}} nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, medicinal and cosmetic applications. This is attributed to their anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic and anti-carcinogenic properties coupled with their capacity to modulate key cellular enzyme function. Research on flavonoids received an added impulse with the discovery of the low cardiovascular mortality rate and also prevention of CHD. Information on the working mechanisms of flavonoids is still not understood properly. However, it has widely been known for centuries that derivatives of plant origin possess a broad spectrum of biological activity. Current trends of research and development activities on flavonoids relate to isolation, identification, characterisation and functions of flavonoids and finally their applications on health benefits. Molecular docking and knowledge of bioinformatics are also being used to predict potential applications and manufacturing by industry. In the present review, {{attempts have been made to}} discuss the current trends of research and development on flavonoids, working mechanisms of flavonoids, flavonoid functions and applications, prediction of flavonoids as potential drugs in preventing chronic diseases and future research directions...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: An unusual fungus for Mordovia Mutinus ravenelii (Berk & M. A. Curtis) E. Fisch, 1888 {{related to}} the Basidiomycota {{mushrooms}} was found in 2016 during the research of microbiota of the Republic of Mordovia. The fungus {{is the subject of}} the interest for mycologists-florists and systematics as a rare adventive species with a significant but intermittent (disjunctive) area. The purpose of the study is to describe the basidia, to locate the findings and to make their morphometry. Materials and Methods: The author used reference books, atlases and databases Index Fungorum and MycoBank for ascertaining the origin of the fungus. Results: This article contains information about the first finding in the Republic of Mordovia the stinkhorn mushroom (Mutinus ravenelii (Berk. & M. A. Curtis) E. Fisch). Then the author describes the form species definition history, its systematic identity, name etymology, fruiting bodies, general spread on the earth, especially its ecology, and the appearance of the American species in Europe. M. ravenelii has been often found in European countries, including Russia in recent years. This is coused by climate warming and globalization processes (cargo of seeds, plants, animals, gardening substrates, traveling) the increase of the greenhouse area and field crops with using the fertile substrates, mulching crops and planting of <b>vegetable</b> crops <b>bark,</b> sawdust, straw. The article indicates macromycetes location, gives their coordinates and finding dates. Discussion and Conclusions: Dimensions of the founded fruiting bodies were typical for the species. M. ravenelii is considered to be an invasive species with unpredictable behavior strategies, so it is should be included into the list of the fungi monitored in Russia...|$|R
40|$|Polyphenols {{are natural}} {{substances}} with variable phenolic structures and are elevated in <b>vegetables,</b> fruits, grains, <b>bark,</b> roots, tea, and wine. There are over 8000 polyphenolic structures identified in plants, but edible plants contain only several hundred polyphenolic structures. In {{addition to their}} well-known antioxidant effects, select polyphenols also have insulin-potentiating, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, anti-viral, anti-ulcer, and anti-apoptotic properties. One important consequence of ischemia is neuronal death and oxidative stress {{plays a key role}} in neuronal viability. In addition, neuronal death may be initiated by the activation of mitochondria-associated cell death pathways. Another consequence of ischemia that is possibly mediated by oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction is glial swelling, a component of cytotoxic brain edema. The purpose of this article is to review the current literature on the contribution of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction to neuronal death, cell swelling, and brain edema in ischemia. A review of currently known mechanisms underlying neuronal death and edema/cell swelling will be undertaken and the potential of dietary polyphenols to reduce such neural damage will be critically reviewed...|$|R
50|$|Most {{species of}} Neriidae are slender, long-legged flies. Many exhibit striped {{patterns}} {{that appear to}} provide camouflage against tree bark. Many neriids are sexually dimorphic, with males having more elongated bodies, heads, antennae, and legs than females. In some species, the male fore-tibia is greatly thickened distally. Neriid flies are saprophagous. Larvae develop in rotting <b>vegetable</b> matter, including <b>bark</b> and fruit. Neriid adults tend to aggregate on rotting vegetable matter or damaged tree trunks. Neriid adults are also attracted to flowers or other sources of sugar. The upper face has a medial division and the antennae are porrect. The arista on the antenna arises at the tip (not dorsally, as in the Micropezidae). The fore legs are long with prominent coxae. In the Micropezidae, the fore legs are reduced. The fore femora (and sometimes all femora) bear ventral spines in males. The fore tibia of males may have rows of spines or tubercles. The third and fourth veins of the wing converge at the tip and the first vein is not setulose. Neriids have 1-5 frontal bristles, no ocellar bristles and some have reduced postvertical bristles.|$|R
40|$|Two <b>vegetable</b> wastes, cork <b>bark</b> and grape stalks, were {{investigated}} {{for the removal}} of methylene blue from aqueous solution. The effects of contact time, dye concentration, pH, and temperature on sorption were studied relative to adsorption on a commercially-activated carbon. The highest adsorption yield was obtained within the pH range 5 to 10 for grape stalks and 7 to 10 for cork bark. The sorption kinetics of dye onto activated carbon and grape stalks was very fast. Kinetics data were fitted to the pseudo-first and second order kinetic equations, and the values of the pseudo-second-order initial rate constants were found to be 1. 69 mg g- 1 min- 1 for activated carbon, 2. 24 mg g- 1 min- 1 for grape stalks, and 0. 90 mg g- 1 min- 1 for cork bark. Langmuir maximum sorption capacities for activated carbon, grape stalks, and cork bark for methylene blue estimated by the Orthogonal Distance Regression method (ODR) were 157. 5 mg g- 1, 105. 6 mg g- 1, and 30. 52 mg g- 1, respectively. FTIR spectra indicated that carboxylic groups and lignin {{play a significant role in}} the sorption of methylene blue. Electrostatic forces, n-p interactions, cation-p, and p-p stacking interactions contribute to methylene blue sorption onto grape stalks and cork bark. Grape stalks can be considered an efficient biosorbent and as a viable alternative to activated carbon and ion-exchange resins {{for the removal of}} methylene blu...|$|R
50|$|Some {{of better}} known {{artisans}} {{in the town}} include the Fuentes family and Delfino Gutierrez. Efrain and Silvia Fuentes, along with their family have a good reputation among woodcarvers in Oaxaca. Efrain began carving {{at a very young}} age and at only 13, was featured in an exhibit in Santa Fe, N.M. The best pieces produced by this family are most often bought by foreigners. Delfino Gutierrez is known for his original designs, specializing in free-form elephants, frogs, turtles, armadillos and other animals. His works have been sold in stores in Chicago, California, New York and Israel.The most successful artisan from the town is Jacobo Angeles, whose work has been displayed in The Smithsonian, Chicago’s National Museum of Mexican Art and museums, art colleges and galleries in various parts of the world. Like other carvers, Angeles began carving at a young age, taught by his family and elders from Tilcajete and other villages. Angeles’ work is distinguished by the fact that he uses only naturally derived paints and materials for his figures. Paints are derived from fruits, <b>vegetables,</b> plants, tree <b>barks,</b> clay and insects. The figures also more closely reflect Zapotec culture and tradition, painting designs derived from sources such as the friezes of the Mitla archeological site and ancient pictographic symbols for phenomena such as waves, mountains and fertility. Angeles also travels extensively to promote Oaxacan folk art, teaching in various educational venues and speaking at art exhibitions.|$|R
50|$|Retrospectives {{of his art}} {{films have}} been held at the Tate Gallery in London, the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, Lincoln Center in New York, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. He {{received}} a Guggenheim Fellowship for this body of work. He has taught in the Visual Arts Program at Princeton University. In 2008 and 2010, he had one-man shows of paintings and film installations at the Sonnabend Gallery. in New York City. Haas's monumental fiberglass sculpture Winter (after Arcimboldo) was unveiled in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in September, 2010, before traveling in 2011 to the Piazza del Duomo in Milan and the Garden of Versailles. In 2012, in a spectacular transformation that is typical of his work, Haas created a group of large-scale, fifteen-foot-high, fibre-glass sculptures, inspired by Giuseppe Arcimboldo's Renaissance paintings of the four seasons, comprising Spring, Summer, Autumn, and including Winter. The colossal size of Haas's sculpture accentuates the visual puzzle of natural forms—flowers, ivy, moss, fungi, <b>vegetables,</b> fruit, trees, <b>bark,</b> branches, twigs, leaves—as they are recycled to form four human portraits, each representing an individual season. The result is at once earthy, fanciful and exuberant—a commentary on Arcimboldo's style and {{a work of art}} in its own right. These sculptures were first seen in the garden of the Dulwich Picture Gallery in the United Kingdom in the summer of 2012, before embarking on a three-year tour of American museums and botanical gardens.|$|R
