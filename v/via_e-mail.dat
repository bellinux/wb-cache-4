5|$|While {{discussing}} the 2006 remix of My Life in the Bush of Ghosts {{at a dinner}} party, Eno suggested finishing some songs that he had written {{but that did not}} have lyrics. Byrne visited Eno's studio to listen to the demos and the two decided to collaborate to finish writing the songs. They continued working on the tracks in New York City and London, with regular e-mail correspondence to finish the composition. Multi-instrumentalist and previous Eno collaborator Leo Abrahams performed guitar, percussion instruments, and piano in his London home studio and played guitar with Byrne on one occasion. Abrahams would continue working on the tracks in his home studio through May 2008, with all collaborations being carried on <b>via</b> <b>e-mail.</b>|$|E

25|$|RFID tags {{are often}} a complement, but not a substitute, for UPC or EAN barcodes. They may never {{completely}} replace barcodes, {{due in part to}} their higher cost and the advantage of multiple data sources on the same object. Also, unlike RFID labels, barcodes can be generated and distributed electronically, e.g. <b>via</b> <b>e-mail</b> or mobile phone, for printing or display by the recipient. An example is airline boarding passes. The new EPC, along with several other schemes, is widely available at reasonable cost.|$|E

In pedagogical exchanges <b>via</b> <b>e-mails,</b> it is unusual to find discussions originatedby questions.

This paper comments on this peculiar trend found in our data and examines why apparentely similar questions which appear in both genres - pedagogic chats and e-mails - result in differentiated typological sequences...|$|R

25|$|Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation is an education-services {{organization}} that provides capstone education programs {{free of charge}} to engineering students and other stakeholders.

All correspondence among members is completed <b>via</b> <b>e-mail,</b> and all meetings are held via Skype, with English as the language of instruction and publication. Students and other stakeholders are never asked to travel or leave their geographic locations, and are encouraged to publish organizational documents in their personal, primary languages, when English is a secondary language.|$|E

The following year in 1995, KXAS became the first commercial television station in Texas to launch a website, which provided news reports and information on the station's community initiatives and on-air staff members; the station expanded its Internet offerings in 1997, when it became the first television station in the Southwestern United States to deliver news alerts <b>via</b> <b>e-mail.</b>|$|E

25|$|Word for Windows is {{available}} stand-alone or {{as part of}} the Microsoft Office suite. Word contains rudimentary desktop publishing capabilities and is the most widely used word processing program on the market. Word files are commonly used as the format for sending text documents <b>via</b> <b>e-mail</b> because almost every user with a computer can read a Word document by using the Word application, a Word viewer or a word processor that imports the Word format (see Microsoft Word Viewer). Word 6 for Windows NT was the first 32-bit version of the product, released with Microsoft Office for Windows NT around the same time as Windows 95. It was a straightforward port of Word 6.0. Starting with Word 95, releases of Word were named after the year of its release, instead of its version number.|$|E

30|$|In {{this paper}} we use Poisson {{distribution}} {{as the time}} distribution for propagation between nodes. In the model, {{it is easy to}} use any statistical distribution or empirical data instead of Poisson distribution. We have made experiments with a model based on Uniform distribution. This describes, for example, propagation of information <b>via</b> <b>e-mails</b> when users process their e-mails at uniformly distributed time points during a day (or other time unit). This distribution gives comparable results, but not exactly the same, because more spreading occurs at low time values when propagation obeys Uniform instead of Poisson distribution.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a framework whereby Internet technologies and microcontrollers are leveraged upon in providing low-cost automated event reporting and metering data in utility companies. This project demonstrates {{the use of}} a low-cost approach for automatically generating event alarm and sensor data reports and communicating these reports <b>via</b> <b>e-mails.</b> This information can also be viewed on demand from a web browser. Concepts presented in this paper can be scaled beyond the scope described by this paper by defining a larger data acquisition system, but the basic concept of generating event reports using low-cost tools is the underlying factor...|$|R
