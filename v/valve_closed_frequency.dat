50|$|Timing: {{inlet valve}} opens 10 degrees before TDC and exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>closes</b> 18 degrees after TDC; Inlet <b>valve</b> <b>closes</b> 30 degrees after bottom centre and exhaust valve opens 52 degrees before bottom centre.|$|R
5000|$|Early intake <b>valve</b> <b>closing</b> (EIVC)Another way to {{decrease}} the pumping losses associated with low engine speed, high vacuum conditions is by <b>closing</b> the intake <b>valve</b> earlier than normal. This involves <b>closing</b> the intake <b>valve</b> midway through the intake stroke. Air/fuel demands are so low at low-load conditions and the work required to fill the cylinder is relatively high, so Early intake <b>valve</b> <b>closing</b> greatly reduces pumping losses. [...] Studies have shown early intake <b>valve</b> <b>closing</b> reduces pumping losses by 40%, and increases fuel economy by 7%. It also reduced nitric oxide emissions by 24% at partial load conditions. A possible downside to early intake <b>valve</b> <b>closing</b> is that it significantly lowers {{the temperature of the}} combustion chamber, which can increase hydrocarbon emissions.|$|R

50|$|A mass of air (working fluid) {{is drawn}} into the cylinder, from 0 to 1, at {{atmospheric}} pressure (constant pressure) through the open intake valve, while the exhaust <b>valve</b> is <b>closed</b> during this process. The intake <b>valve</b> <b>closes</b> at point 1.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{commonly}} related that [...] "stand off" [...] (air-fuel mix that gets pushed {{back out of}} the port, usually at full throttle / low rpm) is somehow captured by installing a longer intake pipe (stack). but, it is actually that the intake <b>valve</b> is <b>closing</b> too late and the combustion chamber is simply overfilling and blowing back out the intake port, before the intake <b>valve</b> <b>closes.</b> A longer inlet pipe will create a later intake pressure wave that will help keep the air in the chamber until the intake <b>valve</b> <b>closes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Inspiratory pump inserts {{a volume}} of PFC in the lungs (valve 1 open, <b>valve</b> 2 <b>closed),</b> and the expiratory pump pushes PFC in the {{oxygenator}} via the filter (<b>valve</b> 3 <b>closed,</b> <b>valve</b> 4 open).|$|R

40|$|Using an {{additional}} valve (i. e. clapper check valves) downstream the main <b>closing</b> <b>valve,</b> fast <b>valve</b> <b>closing</b> is possible without any cavitational hammer. Additionally a new passive safety system (ABS-Armatur) {{for the prevention}} of water hammer upstream the main <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> is introduced. Upstream the closure valve, a brake line connects the transport liquid of the m ain pipe with a hydraulic brake system. In case of <b>valve</b> action (<b>closing),</b> the pressure upstream the valve increases rapidly causing a fast interruption of the closing process. With decreasing pressure the closing process may continue. By combination of both methods pressure up - as well as downstream the <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> may be safely controlled...|$|R

5000|$|Exhaust: The {{exhaust valve}} remains open while the piston moves upward {{expelling}} the combustion gases. For naturally aspirated engines {{a small part}} of the combustion gases may remain in the cylinder during normal operation because the piston does not close the combustion chamber completely; these gases dissolve in the next charge. At the end of this stroke, the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>closes,</b> the intake <b>valve</b> opens, and the sequence repeats in the next cycle. The intake valve may open before the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>closes</b> to allow better scavenging.|$|R

50|$|Once the {{cylindrical}} <b>valve</b> has <b>closed,</b> {{the spring}} presses it still further {{down through the}} seat. There is a small distance between {{the point where the}} cylindrical <b>valve</b> first <b>closes,</b> and where the mitre <b>valve</b> finally <b>closes.</b> This has the effect of slightly increasing the volume of the closed-off volume, including the delivery pipe. As liquids are near-incompressible, even this tiny change in volume has the effect of dropping the pressure in the pipe. This drop in pressure allows the injector <b>valve</b> to <b>close</b> fully, without leakage or dribble.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{four-stroke}} engine, tuned extractor manifolds {{are used}} to promote scavenging of the exhaust gases by delivering a pulse of negative pressure just before the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>closes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{second part}} (the dubb) of the [...] "lubb-dubb" [...] (the second heart sound, or S2), {{is caused by}} the closure of the aortic and {{pulmonary}} valves at the end of ventricular systole. As the left ventricle empties, its pressure falls below the pressure in the aorta, and the aortic <b>valve</b> <b>closes.</b> Similarly, as the pressure in the right ventricle falls below the pressure in the pulmonary artery, the pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>closes.</b> The second heart sound is also two components, A2 and P2. The aortic <b>valve</b> <b>closes</b> earlier than the pulmonary valve and they are audibly separated from each other in the second heart sound. This [...] "splitting" [...] of S2 is only audible during inhalation. However, some cardiac conduction abnormalities such as left bundle branch block (LBBB) allow the P2 sound to be heard before the A2 sound during expiration. With LBBB, inhalation brings A2 and P2 closer together where they cannot be audibly distinguished.|$|R
