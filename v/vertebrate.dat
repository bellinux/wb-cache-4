50|$|The {{original}} scheme groups hagfish and lampreys {{together as}} cyclostomes (or historically, Agnatha), {{as the oldest}} surviving class of <b>vertebrates</b> alongside gnathostomes (the now-ubiquitous jawed <b>vertebrates).</b> The alternative scheme proposed that jawed <b>vertebrates</b> are {{more closely related to}} lampreys than to hagfish (i.e., that <b>vertebrates</b> include lampreys but exclude hagfish), and introduces the category craniata to group <b>vertebrates</b> near hagfish.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Vertebrates</b> [...] {{comprise}} {{all species}} of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata [...] (chordates with backbones). <b>Vertebrates</b> represent {{the overwhelming majority}} of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 66,000 species described. <b>Vertebrates</b> include the jawless fish and the jawed <b>vertebrates,</b> which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks, rays, and ratfish) and the bony fish.|$|R

5|$|In 1945 Stebbins {{was hired}} an {{assistant}} professor of zoology at the University of California, Berkeley, and became the first curator of herpetology at the Museum of <b>Vertebrate</b> Zoology, where he would remain throughout his career. The first faculty member to teach herpetology at Berkeley, he wrote new lab manuals, created the herpetology teaching collection, and co-taught a popular course on <b>vertebrate</b> natural history.|$|E
5|$|Some plants, {{notably the}} grasses, use indigestible silica (and many plants use other {{relatively}} indigestible {{materials such as}} lignin) to defend themselves against <b>vertebrate</b> and invertebrate herbivores. Plants take up silicon from the soil and deposit it in their tissues {{in the form of}} solid silica phytoliths. These mechanically reduce the digestibility of plant tissue, causing rapid wear to <b>vertebrate</b> teeth and insect mandibles, and are effective against herbivores above and below ground. The mechanism may offer future sustainable pest control strategies.|$|E

50|$|A neuroendocrine {{system has}} been {{observed}} in all animals with a nervous system and all <b>vertebrates</b> have an hypothalamus-pituitary axis. All <b>vertebrates</b> have a thyroid, which in amphibians is also crucial for transformation of larvae into adult form. All <b>vertebrates</b> have adrenal gland tissue, with mammals unique in having it organized into layers. All <b>vertebrates</b> {{have some form of}} renin-angiotensin axis, and all tetrapods have aldosterone as primary mineralocorticoid.|$|R

5|$|Although {{formerly}} {{common in}} its range, the species {{was on the}} brink of extinction in Victoria by 1917. However, numbers have built up again since the 1930–40s as it reestablished in its former territory. On the 2007 advisory list of threatened <b>vertebrate</b> fauna in Victoria, this species is listed as near threatened.|$|E
50|$|The {{adaptive}} immunity, {{mediated by}} antibodies and T cells, is only found in <b>vertebrates.</b> Whereas {{all of them}} have a gut-associated lymphoid tissue and the vast majority have a version of spleen and thymus, not all <b>vertebrates</b> show bone marrow, lymph nodes or germinal centers, what means that not all <b>vertebrates</b> can generate lymphocytes in bone marrow. This different distribution of the adaptive organs in the different groups of <b>vertebrates</b> suggests GALT as the very first part of the adaptive immune system in <b>vertebrates.</b> It has been suggested that from this existing GALT, and due to the pressure put by commensal bacteria in gut that coevolved with <b>vertebrates,</b> later specializations as thymus, spleen or lymph nodes appeared as part of the adaptive immune system.|$|R

50|$|The pharyngula is a {{stage in}} the {{embryonic}} development of <b>vertebrates.</b> At this stage, the embryos of all <b>vertebrates</b> are similar, having developed features typical of <b>vertebrates,</b> such {{as the beginning of}} a spinal cord. Named by William Ballard, the pharyngula stage follows the blastula, gastrula and neurula stages.|$|R
5|$|B and T {{lymphocytes}} bearing immunoglobulins and T cell receptors, respectively, {{are found}} in all jawed fishes. Indeed, the adaptive immune {{system as a whole}} evolved in an ancestor of all jawed <b>vertebrate.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{and similar}} animals may {{possibly}} be the common {{ancestors of the}} broad swath of all <b>vertebrate</b> terrestrial fauna: amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The first well-preserved Tiktaalik fossils were found in 2004 on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada.|$|E
5|$|Most of the cancer-causing {{mutations}} {{cause the}} protein to be truncated at the carboxy-terminus. The C-terminal end of folliculin has {{shown to be}} the domain through which it interacts with FNIP1, and thereby possibly the mTOR pathway. FLCN is highly conserved in vertebrates—it is very similar between many <b>vertebrate</b> species. The 508th amino acid, normally lysine, is affected by a missense mutation in some people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. The lysine at this position {{is found to be}} conserved between invertebrate and <b>vertebrate</b> orthologs of folliculin, indicating {{that it is important to}} the protein's function.|$|E
50|$|Sialic acids {{are found}} at all cell {{surfaces}} of <b>vertebrates</b> and some invertebrates, and also at certain bacteria that interact with <b>vertebrates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cephalization in <b>vertebrates,</b> {{the group}} that {{includes}} mammals, birds, and fishes, has been studied extensively. The heads of <b>vertebrates</b> are complex structures with many features not found in close relatives such as the cephalochordates. The cephalochordate Branchiostoma (formerly called Amphioxus), which is the closest relative of <b>vertebrates,</b> is a burrowing marine creature which lacks most of the head structures that are so distinct in <b>vertebrates,</b> such as distinct sense organs; a large, multilobed brain; teeth; and a tongue.|$|R
5000|$|The adeleorins are one-host parasites of {{invertebrates}} or <b>vertebrates,</b> or two-host parasites that alternately infect haematophagous (blood-feeding) invertebrates and {{the blood}} of <b>vertebrates.</b>|$|R
5|$|Neuroanatomists usually {{divide the}} <b>vertebrate</b> brain into six main regions: the {{telencephalon}} (cerebral hemispheres), diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus), mesencephalon (midbrain), cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata. Each {{of these areas}} has a complex internal structure. Some parts, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar cortex, consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within the available space. Other parts, such as the thalamus and hypothalamus, consist of clusters of many small nuclei. Thousands of distinguishable areas can be identified within the <b>vertebrate</b> brain based on fine distinctions of neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity.|$|E
5|$|One aetosaur, Typothorax coccinarum, {{has been}} used to define the Revueltian land <b>vertebrate</b> faunachron. A land <b>vertebrate</b> faunachron (LVF) is a time {{interval}} that is defined by the first appearance datum (FAD), or first occurrence, of a tetrapod index fossil and is commonly used to date Late Triassic and Early Jurassic terrestrial strata. Since the FAD of T. coccinarum is {{at the beginning of the}} Norian stage, the Revueltian LVF starts at the beginning of the Norian around 216 million years ago. The Revueltian ends with the next FAD, which happens to be that of the phytosaur Redondasaurus and the start of the Apachean LVF.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of <b>vertebrate</b> TnI isoforms demonstrated {{that each of}} the muscle type-specific isoforms is more conserved across species than the three isoforms in one given species, indicating early diverged functions of the muscle fiber type-specific isoforms as well as the conservation of functions for each muscle fiber type.|$|E
25|$|The {{lampreys}} {{are a very}} ancient {{lineage of}} <b>vertebrates,</b> though their exact relationship to hagfishes and jawed <b>vertebrates</b> is still a matter of dispute.|$|R
50|$|Evolutionary {{origins of}} <b>vertebrates</b> {{as well as}} the phylum Chordata have not been scientifically determined. Many believe <b>vertebrates</b> diverged from a common {{ancestor}} of chordates and echinoderms. This belief is well supported by the prehistoric marine creature Amphioxus. Amphioxus does not possess bone, making it an invertebrate, but it has common features with <b>vertebrates</b> including a segmented body and a notochord. This could imply that Amphioxus is a transitional form between an early chordate, echinoderm or common ancestor, and <b>vertebrates.</b>|$|R
40|$|Atrial natriuretic peptide {{was found}} in the heart of <b>vertebrates,</b> we studied the ANP {{presence}} in the heart of Ciona intestinalis. This animal is very important because of its evolutionary position between invertebrates and <b>vertebrates.</b> ANP presence was only revelead in myoepithelial cells of the myocardium. Results suggest the hypothesis that ANP is present not only in the <b>vertebrates</b> but also in the invertebrates and in Ciona heart ANP might play a similar role like in the heart of <b>vertebrates...</b>|$|R

5|$|Similarly, the extinct {{pterosaur}} {{also shows}} an independent evolution of <b>vertebrate</b> fore- and hindlimbs to wing. An even more distantly related group, the insects, have wings that evolved separately from different organs.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scientists}} have {{hypothesized that the}} development of monothecate anthers and larger flowers (compared to those of the remaining genera in Durioneae) in the clade consisting of Durio, Boschia, and Cullenia was in conjunction with a transition from beetle pollination to <b>vertebrate</b> pollination.|$|E
50|$|Salps {{appear to}} have a form {{preliminary}} to <b>vertebrates,</b> and are used as a starting point in models of how <b>vertebrates</b> evolved. Scientists speculate that the tiny groups of nerves in salps are one of the first instances of a primitive nervous system, which eventually evolved into the more complex central nervous systems of <b>vertebrates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Those {{supporting}} a convergent evolution state that this common ancestor would have preceded both cephalopods and <b>vertebrates</b> {{by a significant}} margin. The common ancestor with the expression for camera-type eye would have existed approximately 270 million years before the evolution of camera-type eye in cephalopods and approximately 110 to 260 million years before the evolution of camera-type eye in <b>vertebrates.</b> Another source of evidence {{for this is the}} differences of expression due to independent variants of Pax6 arising in both cephalopods and <b>vertebrates.</b> Cephalopods contain five variants of Pax6 in their genomes which independently arose and are not shared by <b>vertebrates,</b> although they allow for a similar gene expression when compared to the Pax6 of <b>vertebrates.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Smiths {{research}} primarily {{has focused}} on the conodont palaeobiology and the early Palaeozoic radiation of <b>vertebrates.</b> He is known for discovering that conodont teeth were made of bone cells, such as are found only in <b>vertebrates.</b> This dated the origin of the <b>vertebrates</b> to 515 million years before the present, 40 million years earlier than had been previously thought.|$|R
