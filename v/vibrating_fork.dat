50|$|Another {{reason for}} using the fork shape is that, when it vibrates in its {{principal}} mode, the handle vibrates {{up and down as}} the prongs move apart and together. There is a node (point of no vibration) at the base of each prong. The handle motion is small, allowing the fork to be held by the handle without damping the vibration, but it allows the handle to transmit the vibration to a resonator, which amplifies the sound of the fork. The fork is usually struck, and then the handle is pressed against a wooden box resonator, or a table top. Without the resonator the sound of a tuning fork is very faint. The {{reason for this is that}} the sound waves produced by each fork prong are 180° out of phase with the other, so at a distance from the fork they interfere and largely cancel each other out. If a sound absorbing sheet is slid in between the prongs of a <b>vibrating</b> <b>fork,</b> reducing the waves reaching the ear from one prong, the volume heard will actually increase, due to a reduction of this cancellation.|$|E
50|$|Vibrating Element Transducers: This type of {{instrument}} {{requires a}} vibrating element {{to be placed in}} contact with the fluid of interest. The resonant frequency of the element is measured and is related to the density of the fluid by a characterization that is dependent upon the design of the element. In modern laboratories precise measurements of relative density are made using oscillating U-tube meters. These are capable of measurement to 5 to 6 places beyond the decimal point and are used in the brewing, distilling, pharmaceutical, petroleum and other industries. The instruments measure the actual mass of fluid contained in a fixed volume at temperatures between 0 and 80 °C but as they are microprocessor based can calculate apparent or true relative density and contain tables relating these to the strengths of common acids, sugar solutions, etc. The <b>vibrating</b> <b>fork</b> immersion probe is another good example of this technology. This technology also includes many coriolis-type mass flow meters which are widely used in chemical and petroleum industry for high accuracy mass flow measurement and can be configured to also output density information based on the resonant frequency of the vibrating flow tubes.|$|E

We have tested the accuracy of this calibration using three methods: measurement of the amplitude at which the fork prongs touch each other; direct optical measurement of the moving fork prongs using strobe microscopy; and a Michelson interferometry technique operating with a 670 nm laser. All three methods yield consistent results. The velocity so determined is found to be 10 % lower than that of the standard electro-mechanical calibration...|$|E

The {{need for}} new environrnentally {{acceptable}} refrigerants, with low or zero ozone depletion potential and low global warming potential, led the industrial and the scientific community to launch a significant research effort on the thermophysical properties of these compounds. It {{is the purpose of}} this paper to give an overall view of the current research in this field, started in 1990 by our group, in collaboration with the LIMHPCNRS, Villetaneuse, France, and the NIST, Boulder, USA. The effort has been concentrated in developing equipments to measure density dielectric constant and thermal conductivity in the liquid phase, covering the temperature and pressure ranges necessary for the normal duty of these fluids. The dielectric constant and the thermal conductivity of three provisional replacements, HCFC 123, HCFC 141 b, HCFC 142 b and two c 1 ass A fluids, HFC 134 a and HFC 152 a, have been measured in the temperature range 200 to 300 K and pressures up to 20 MPa, using a direct capacitance method, by measuring the capacitance of a cylinder filled with the sample and in vacuum, using an impedance analyzer, and the polarized hot wire technique. The density of HCFC 142 b, HCFC 22 + HCFC 142 b and HCFC 14 lb was measured with a <b>vibrating</b> <b>fork</b> densimeter, calibrated with toluene, 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane and vacuum. The instruments are capable of obtaining the dielectric constant with an absolute uncertainty of 0. 1 %, the thermal conductivity with 0. 5 % and the density with 0. 1 %. An Hard Sphere De Santis equation of state has been used to develop an universal estimation scheme for the density of pure refrigerants and of their mixtures, based only upon the properties of pure fluids, capable of calculating the density of the liquid phase with an uncertainty better than 1. 5 % for T/Tc < 0. 9. The density dependence of the dielectric constant has been studied using the concept of Eulerian strain and the Onsager-Kirkwood theories.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{optimisation}} of the mechanical behaviour of a tuning fork microgyrometer, aimed at improving its performance. Two different configurations of the instrument have been analysed and compared, the ‘wide gap’ design and ‘narrow gap’ design. In the former case the air gap between the <b>vibrating</b> <b>forks</b> and the flat substrate is so large that the air flow around each fork is not influenced by the substrate presence. This geometrical configuration results in a very low air damping, that allows the instrument to operate at atmospheric pressure. In the ‘narrow gap’ case {{the distance between the}} forks and the substrate is instead very small. As a consequence, the instrument needs to operate under very low pressure conditions. Although this requirement represents a drawback of the narrow gap solution, we have found out that this instrument configuration, when compared to the wide gap design, allows to achieve a significantly smaller dynamic error and a significantly wider range of linearity. The thickness of the air gap represents, indeed, an additional parameter that can be adjusted by the designer to optimise the performances of the instrument. We have developed an accurate analytical model of the sensor, focusing, in particular, the attention on the two tines of the drive mode, which are the structural components that more than others influence the performance of the whole instrument. The optimal design of these fundamental elements can be, indeed, carried out neglecting the interaction with the remaining part of the sensor structure.

40|$|We analyse the {{performances}} of two different configurations of a tuning fork microgyrometer, the so called 'wide gap' design and 'narrow gap' design. In the former case the air gap between the <b>vibrating</b> <b>forks</b> and {{the walls of the}} surrounding frame is so large that the air flow around each fork is not influenced by the presence of the frame itself. This geometrical configuration results in a very low air damping, and, hence, allows the instrument to operate at atmospheric pressure. In the case of 'narrow gap' design the distance between the forks and the frame walls is instead very small. As a consequence, the instrument needs to operate under very low pressure conditions, since, at higher pressures, the presence of a thin layer of air would increase the air damping to very large values, and would not allow the correct operation of the instrument. Although the requirement of low pressure conditions represents a drawback of the narrow gap solution, we show that this instrument configuration, when compared to the wide gap design, allows to achieve a significantly smaller dynamic error and a significantly wider range of linearity. Indeed the thickness of the air gap represents an additional parameter that can be adjusted by the designer to optimise {{the performances}} of the instrument.

Methods: Eight operators were recruited to operate the motorized forks during this laboratory study. Four fork configurations {{were used in}} the study; two motor speeds and two fork basket options were evaluated. Accelerations were measured near each hand as the operators completed the simulated beach-cleaning task. Results: The dominant vibration frequency for these tools was identified to be around 20 Hz.

These forks exhibited considerable acceleration magnitudes when unloaded. Conclusions: The study results suggest that the motor should not be operated with the fork in the unloaded state. Anti-vibration gloves are not effective at attenuating the vibration frequencies produced by these forks, and they may even amplify the transmitted vibration and increase hand/arm fatigue. While regular work gloves are suitable, vibration-reducing gloves may not be appropriate for use with these tools.

Several guidelines recommend the use of OAR based on a systematic review from 2003. Ten years later, one can wonder if this recommendation should be changed. Objective To review systematically the current evidence on the most accurate method to assess the fracture risk after an ankle sprain in adults. Methods A methodical search for systematic reviews, meta-analyses and primary studies {{was carried out in}} Medline, Cochrane Database of systematic reviews, Embase, Pedro, CINAHL, Medion and specific guideline search engines.

The patient is asked to report in which ear the sound is heard louder. A normal weber test has a patient reporting the sound heard equally in both sides. In an affected patient, if the defective ear hears the Weber tuning fork louder, the finding indicates a conductive hearing loss in the defective ear. In an affected patient, if the normal ear hears the tuning fork sound better, there is sensorineural hearing loss on the other (defective) ear. However, the aforegoing presumes one knows in advance which ear is defective and which is normal (such as the patient telling the clinician that they cannot hear as well in one ear versus the other) and the testing is being done to characterize the type, conductive or sensorineural, of hearing loss that is occurring. In the case where the patient is unaware or has acclimated to their hearing loss, the clinician has to use the Rinne test in conjunction with the Weber to characterize and localize any deficits.
