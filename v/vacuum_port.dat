50|$|The vacuum bazooka uses a {{straight}} tube which is sealed with {{a type of}} bursting disk at the launch end and by the projectile at the other. A tee-piece at the launch end allows application of vacuum. When the projectile is released the air pressure behind the projectile causes it to accelerate towards the <b>vacuum</b> <b>port.</b> When the projectile reaches the <b>vacuum</b> <b>port</b> its momentum causes it to continue past and break through the bursting disk towards the target. A lightweight bursting disk such {{as a piece of}} paper can be secured simply by the vacuum action when it is held against the barrel.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{effective}} {{engine control unit}} computers, engine vacuum was used for many functions in an automobile. Vacuum switches were employed to regulate this flow. For instance a dual port vacuum switch located in a port on the intake manifold monitored the coolant temperature in the coolant crossover. It received <b>vacuum</b> (<b>port</b> E on the switch) from the carburetor. The vacuum flowed through the switch to a vacuum solenoid (such as a heat riser, used to restrict exhaust allowing the engine to heat up faster). When the coolant heated to operating temperature the vacuum switch closed off the port (port S on the vacuum switch) turning off the vacuum to the heat riser. The result is to clear the exhaust restriction. The switch monitored the temperature and when conditions were right it performed its designed function.|$|E

Since residual gas pressure is too low to support reliable profile measurements based on beam induced scintillation, a piezo-electric dosing valve was installed allowing fast injections of defined amount of nitrogen. A 32 -channel photomultiplier is used to detect light. Beam profile measurements and first experience are reported...|$|R
5000|$|Some resins, such as polyesters, {{give off}} {{significant}} amounts of volatiles during cure. These will carry out through the vacuum ports and sometimes cause damage to the pump. The better vacuum pumps use oil reservoirs and oil recirculation, and these volatiles can quickly turn the oil into a revolting mush. They also attack the seals of vacuum valves and cause deposits to build up over time. To prevent this, {{it may be necessary}} to install condensers on the <b>vacuum</b> <b>port</b> lines. These will require [...] chilled water. A small chiller will add several thousand dollars to the cost of the autoclave, plus another several hundred dollars per port for the condenser and separator. The stainless steel resin traps should be designed and made to be easily disassembled and cleaned. Naturally, they must also be fully accessible.|$|E
50|$|The {{stationary}} phase {{comes in the}} form of a packed syringe-shaped cartridge, a 96 well plate, a 47- or 90-mm flat disk, or a microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS) device, a SPE method that uses a packed sorbent material in a liquid handling syringe. These can be mounted on its specific type of extraction manifold. The manifold allows multiple samples to be processed by holding several SPE media in place and allowing for an equal number of samples to pass through them simultaneously. A typical cartridge SPE manifold can accommodate up to 24 cartridges, while a typical disk SPE manifold can accommodate 6 disks. Most SPE manifolds are equipped with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>port.</b> Application of vacuum speeds up the extraction process by pulling the liquid sample through the {{stationary phase}}. The analytes are collected in sample tubes inside or below the manifold after they pass through the stationary phase.|$|E
50|$|After {{receiving}} his PhD, Caves {{continued at}} Caltech as a Research Fellow in Physics (1979-81) {{and then as}} Senior Research Fellow in Theoretical Physics (1982-87). During 1987-92 he was Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering (and Physics from 1989) at the University of Southern California. He moved to Albuquerque in 1992 to become a Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the University of New Mexico (UNM). In 2006 {{he was promoted to}} Distinguished Professor, UNM’s highest faculty rank. In 2009 he was appointed the inaugural Director of the Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC), an interdisciplinary center at UNM and the University of Arizona, which investigates and develops a new generation of technologies for controlling the behavior of quantum systems. Caves {{is best known for his}} proposal in 1981 that squeezed light injected into the <b>vacuum</b> <b>port</b> of an interferometer can improve the interferometer’s sensitivity for detecting small phase changes. This proposal prompted thirty years of technology development to design squeezed-light sources that can improve the exquisite sensitivity achieved by the very large interferometers that have been constructed to detect gravitational waves from astrophysical events. The squeezed-light technique has been demonstrated in the GEO600 and LIGO gravitational-wave detectors.|$|E

50|$|One {{source for}} vacuum advance {{is a small}} opening located in {{the wall of the}} {{throttle}} body or carburetor adjacent to but slightly upstream of the edge of the throttle plate. This is called a <b>ported</b> <b>vacuum.</b> The effect of having the opening here is that {{there is little or no}} vacuum at idle, hence little or no advance. Other vehicles use vacuum directly from the intake manifold. This provides full engine vacuum (and hence, full vacuum advance) at idle. Some vacuum advance units have two vacuum connections, one at each side of the actuator membrane, connected to both manifold <b>vacuum</b> and <b>ported</b> <b>vacuum.</b> These units will both advance and retard the ignition timing.|$|R

40|$|A small robust {{system has}} been {{constructed}} for in-situ visual inspection of the Alcator C-Mod tokamak. The system consists of a small, light, wide-angle high definition camera and LED package housed in a nacelle {{on the end of}} thin, rigid, 3. 5 m long support pole. The nacelle has two actuated degrees of freedom allowing the camera to observe nearly 4 π steradians. The support pole has a specific slight curve that allows it to pass to either side of the center column of the tokamak to observe the entirety of the vessel interior, while still fitting through the small aspect ratio Alcator C-Mod <b>vacuum</b> <b>port</b> structure. The support pole and camera can enter the vessel through any horizontal <b>vacuum</b> <b>port</b> with an inner diameter greater than 4 cm, thus a dedicated port is not required. The inspection is typically undertaken during maintenance periods when the vessel is filled with a noble gas near atmospheric pressure thus minimizing the influx of water vapor and the concomitant loss of wall conditioning. The system is operated manually, producing photos and video which are reviewed in near real-time. Nearly the entire vessel, including the plasma facing components, can be carefully inspected in 3 – 5 h. The system provides improved characterization of the interior components and surfaces of the tokamak with a modest engineering and operational effort. Information gathered from the system has identified damage to plasma facing components that were interfering with tokamak operation, as well as damage to mechanical components which were redesigned during the remainder of the campaign, thereby enhancing program planning.

40|$|The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) is a SASE 1. 5 - 15 {angstrom} x-ray Free-Electron Laser (FEL) facility. Since an ultra-short intense bunch {{is used in}} the LCLS {{operation}} {{one might}} suggest that wake fields, generated in the vacuum chamber, may {{have an effect on the}} x-ray production because these fields can change the beam particle energies thereby increasing the energy spread in a bunch. At LCLS a feedback system precisely controls the bunch energy before it enters a beam transport line after the linac. However, in the transport line and later in the undulator section the bunch energy and energy spread are not under feedback control and may change due to wake field radiation, which depends upon the bunch current or on a bunch length. The linear part of the energy spread can be compensated in the upstream linac; the energy loss in the undulator section can be compensated by varying the K-parameter of the undulators, however we need a precise knowledge of the wake fields in this part of the machine. Resistive wake fields are known and well calculated.

40|$|The {{spectrum}} of long bunches {{injected into the}} ring with RF switched off {{has been used in}} the SPS in the past to probe the longitudinal coupling impedance.

As corresponding high-frequency impedance could potentially lead to microwave instability of high intensity bunches observed now at high energies in the SPS, a search of the source of this impedance was launched. Using a combination of impedance simulations and measurements, vacuum flanges that are present in a large quantity in the machine have been identified as a main source of impedance at this frequency. Particle simulations based on the SPS impedance model, which includes this previously unknown impedance, are able to reproduce the characteristics of the bunch spectrum and amplitude growth rates and hence, confirm that the impedance of the vacuum flanges is responsible for the observed spectral peak...|$|R

In the previous prototype to the ELIXYS [21], the cassettes each had multiple inputs on their bottom surface for inert gas and vacuum that mated with corresponding ports on the synthesizer. This system was prone to failure due to {{the large number of}} connections and the difficulty in maintaining reliable gas-tight seals during operation. With a single, movable gas supplying robot in ELIXYS, a large number of valves and seals are eliminated, increasing the reliability of the system. The gas supplier is lowered to engage respective vacuum and inert gas ports on top of the cassette (Figure  4). The cassettes contain a rubber gasket around each port to form a gas-tight seal with the port on the robot. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>port</b> is mounted at a height above the inert gas port and on a spring-loaded mechanism to ensure proper sealing of both ports when needed and to avoid collision of the vacuum portion of the gas supplier when vacuum is not needed.|$|E
