5|$|Both sides cite strong evidence, and the {{conflict}} {{has yet to}} be resolved. The shell of testudines distinguishes them from other vertebrates. The shell is not an exoskeleton, but a modified ribcage and part of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>column.</b> Because of the shell, the pectoral and pelvic girdles are located within the ribcage. The limb bones are also modified to accommodate to the shell.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} biomechanical {{properties}} of 2 veterinary locking plates and monocortical screws/polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) fixation in canine cadaveric cervical <b>vertebral</b> <b>columns.</b> STUDY DESIGN: Biomechanical cadaveric study. MATERIALS: Nineteen cervical <b>vertebral</b> <b>columns</b> (C 2 -C 7) from large breed, skeletally mature, canine cadavers were used. A cortical ring was placed as a disk spacer at C 4 -C 5 in all specimens. Seven <b>vertebral</b> <b>columns</b> were plated at C 4 -C 5 with two 4 -hole, 3. 5 mm string of pearls plates (SOP) and 6 <b>vertebral</b> <b>columns</b> were plated with two 6 -hole, 2. 4 mm titanium locking reconstruction plates (Ti recon plate). All screws were placed monocortically. Six <b>vertebral</b> <b>columns</b> had monocortical titanium screws and PMMA (Ti screws/PMMA) placed, tested {{as part of}} a prior study. METHODS: Stiffness testing in 3 directions was performed of the unaltered C 4 -C 5 vertebral motion unit and repeated after placement of the disk spacer and implants.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} the biomechanical effect of an intervertebral spacer on construct stiffness in a PVC model and cadaveric canine cervical <b>vertebral</b> <b>columns</b> stabilized with monocortical screws/polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). STUDY DESIGN Biomechanical study. SAMPLE POPULATION PVC pipe; cadaveric canine <b>vertebral</b> <b>columns.</b> METHODS PVC model-PVC pipe {{was used to}} create a gap model mimicking vertebral endplate orientation and disk space width of large-breed canine cervical vertebrae; 6 models had a 4 -mm gap with no spacer (PVC group 1); 6 had a PVC pipe ring spacer filling the gap (PCV group 2). Animals-large breed cadaveric canine cervical <b>vertebral</b> <b>columns</b> (C 2 -C 7) from skeletally mature dogs without (cadaveric group 1, n[*]=[*] 6, historical data) and with an intervertebral disk spacer (cadaveric group 2, n[*]=[*] 6) were used. All PVC models and cadaver specimens were instrumented with monocortical titanium screws/PMMA. Stiffness of the 2 PVC groups was compared in extension, flexion, and lateral bending using non-destructive 4 -point bend testing. Stiffness testing in all 3 directions was performed of the unaltered C 4 -C 5 vertebral motion unit in cadaveric spines and repeated after placement of an intervertebral cortical allograft ring and instrumentation. Data were compared using a linear mixed model approach that also incorporated data from previously tested spines with the same screw/PMMA construct but without disk spacer (cadaveric group 1). RESULTS Addition of a spacer increased construct stiffness in both the PVC model (P[*]<[*]. 001) and cadaveric <b>vertebral</b> <b>columns</b> (P[*]<[*]. 001) compared to fixation without a spacer.

5|$|The <b>vertebral</b> <b>column</b> in bowfin is ossified and in {{comparison}} to earlier fishes, the centra are the major support for the body, whereas in earlier fish the notochord was the main form of support. Neural spines and ribs provide additional support and help stabilize unpaired fins. In bowfin neural spines and ribs also increase in prominence, an evolutionary aspect that helps them stabilize unpaired fins. The evolution of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>column</b> allows the bowfin to withstand lateral bending that puts the column under compression without breaking. This, in turn, allows the bowfin to have more controlled and powerful movements, {{in comparison}} to fish that had only a notochord. The bowfin has a homocercal tail, {{which means that the}} tail has equal lobes that appear symmetrical.This type of tail gives the body a streamlined shape which allows the bowfin to improve its swimming ability by reducing drag. These types of tails are common in fish with gas bladders, because the bladder supplies the fish with natural buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{esophagus}} lies at {{the back}} of the mediastinum behind the trachea, adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe, and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the <b>vertebral</b> <b>column.</b> The lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta. From the bifurcation of the trachea downwards, the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left atrium. At this point it passes through the diaphragm.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} basic body plan {{and at some point}} in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the <b>vertebral</b> <b>column</b> and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the <b>vertebral</b> <b>column,</b> formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{aspects of}} the <b>vertebral</b> <b>columns</b> of two {{historical}} Brandenburgian popula-tions (from Germany), {{on the basis of}} 3262 vertebrae from 182 skeletons, are examined paleopathologically. Principally, it is intended to compare the urban adult population from the city Bernau and the rural adult population from the village Tasdorf. This statis-tic comparison enables also to contrast the periods of the Middle Age and the Modern Age. Furthermore, the vertebral states within both sexes and within the different age groups are compared with regard to these osteological aspects. The data paint a very detailed and multi-faceted picture of the two populations, but they give the impression of a better state of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>columns</b> in Tasdorf (in the country) than in Bernau (in the city). They also show a better state of health of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>columns</b> in the Middle Age than in the Modern Age. The <b>vertebral</b> <b>columns</b> of women are in a better general state than those of men. In addition, only a slow aggravation of verte-bral problems concomitant to increasing age is noticed. The detected differences can be explained by different occupations, housing conditions and social situations in these two places. Additionally, an in-depth discussion has been provided on the problems of the hetero-geneity of nomenclature and the need of an optimization of the methods in the field of spine research. While doing this, starting out from literature, suggestions for more pre-cise definitions with the purpose of a better differentiation of the so-called „osteophytes“ have been drawn up and more critical meticulousness in diagnosing a supposed „spondylosis“, particularly in the area of palaeopathology, is as well called for...|$|R

5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in the embryo {{in the same manner}} and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include the legs of a centipede, the maxillary palp and labial palp of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a <b>vertebral</b> <b>column.</b> Male and female reproductive organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals including humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{back was}} also reconstructed {{in a more}} or less {{horizontal}} orientation by Borsuk-Białynicka, which was followed by most subsequent depictions. In a 2007 study, Daniela Schwarz and colleagues suggested that the back dipped towards the rear. According to these researchers, the shoulder blade would have been inclined at a horizontal angle of 55–65°, much steeper than previously thought, resulting in an elevated shoulder region. With the <b>vertebral</b> <b>column</b> of the trunk and neck held in a relatively straight line, this would result in an elevated position of the head.|$|E
5|$|The {{caudal fin}} is homocercal, meaning {{the upper and}} lower lobes are about equal in size.

The neural arches are elongated to form uroneurals which provide support for this upper lobe. In addition, the hypurals, bones that form a flattened plate at the posterior end of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>column,</b> are enlarged providing further support for the caudal fin.|$|E

FWS is characterized mainly by skeletal abnormalities, which include nasal hypoplasia, a depressed or narrowed nasal bridge, scoliosis, and calcifications in the <b>vertebral</b> <b>column,</b> femur, and heel bone, which show a peculiar stippled appearance on X-rays. Limb abnormalities, such as brachydactyly (unusually short fingers and toes) or underdeveloped extremities, can also occur. Common nonskeletal features of FWS include low birth weight and developmental disabilities.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs of Plesiorycteropus show specializations for scratch-digging, {{in which}} the forefeet are placed against the substrate, the claws are entered into the substrate, and the forefeet are then drawn back against the body. Other {{parts of the body}} also show such specializations, {{including}} large hindlimbs and a broad tail. Some aspects of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>column</b> and the pelvis suggest that the animal often assumed an erect, or sitting, posture. The animal may also have been capable of climbing, perhaps {{in a manner similar to}} gymnures and shrew tenrecs, which are small-eyed like Plesiorycteropus. It was probably myrmecophagous, eating insects such as ants and termites, but may also have eaten other soft food, and because of its small size probably did not forage in termite mounds, as the aardvark does.|$|E
5|$|The nesting {{specimen}} MPC-D 107/15 {{has provided}} much {{information about the}} taphonomic processes (changes during fossilisation) in the Baruungoyot Formation. The specimen is preserved in facies that {{are thought to have}} been deposited through a sandstorm or dune-shift. It {{does not seem to have}} been transported after death, but the body appears to have shifted slightly to the right, indicating the sediment in which it was deposited came towards it from its left side. The neck is curved to the left, the left hand is folded backwards, and the legs are folded into a crouching position. The <b>vertebral</b> <b>column,</b> neck, and hips deteriorated during burial, and much of the damage to the skeleton is thought to have been caused by the activity of invertebrates. Borings in the bones, burrows, and reworked sediments (perhaps caused by the construction of pupal chambers) in the specimen indicate it was scavenged upon by colonies of skin beetles (Dermestidae) and perhaps other scavenging insects. There are many feeding traces in the joints of the skeleton, and almost all the surfaces where the bones articulated have been obliterated. There are also tunnels in the nest under the neck and skull, and no egg remains have been found in parts with such traces. Modern skin beetles mainly feed on muscle tissue but not on moist materials, and their activity is prevented by rapid burial. It is therefore thought that specimen MPC-D107/15 was only partially buried at first, with the upper part being exposed enough for a colony of skin beetles to develop. Some damage to the skeleton (especially in the <b>vertebral</b> <b>column)</b> may also have been caused by the scavenging of small mammals.|$|E

40|$|The {{morphological}} {{changes of}} thoracic apophyseal joints were investigated {{in regards to}} aging. Observaion {{was made by the}} use of 108 macerated <b>vertebral</b> <b>columns</b> and 25 <b>vertebral</b> <b>columns</b> of cadavers used for anatomy dissection. 1. Observation of the thoracic apophyseal joints in macerated samples revealed changes in the: (a) pitting of the joint surface (A, B type), (b) bony protuberance on the joint surface, (c) marginal osteophyte of the joint facet, and (d) lamina erosion. 2. The above-mentioned bone changes were observed by histological examination of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>columns</b> from the cadavers used for anatomy dissection. The changes were summarized as osteoarthritic which resulted from a degenerative alteration of the apophyseal joint. 3. Rate of appearance of the apophyseal joint change in macerated materials was investigated. A-type pittings and marginal osteophytes appeared prior to 29 years of age, while all bone alterations were observed at 30 years and above. Appearance of the joint change increased with aging. 4. In addition, the occurrence of bone changes at the different levels of the apophyseal joint of macerated bones was investigated. Bone changes occurred most frequently at the T 4 / 5 level of the upper thoracic vertebra and at the T 11 / 12 level of the lower thoracic vertebra. This suggests that the motion range in the thoracic spine and the manners of movements between the two adjacent vertebrae influenced the formation of these bone changes...|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from the}} skull, the {{skeleton}} of Istiodactylus was {{similar to those of}} other ornithocheiroid pterosaurs. The <b>vertebral</b> <b>column,</b> forelimb, and trunk bones were pneumatised by air sacs. The neural arches of the vertebrae had tall, sloping laminae. The notarium (a structure consisting of fused vertebrae in the shoulder-region of some pterosaurs and birds) consisted of six fused trunk vertebrae, with their neural spines fused into a plate, on which the shoulder blades articulated with a depression on each side. The main part of the sternum was very deep, with a bowed front edge and a shallow, triangular keel. The facets of the sternum that contacted with the coracoids were saddle-shaped and arranged asymmetrically. The humerus (upper arm bone) was stout and had a sharply curved deltopectoral crest. The forelimbs of istiodactylids were large, up to 4.5 times longer than their legs. The long wing-finger may have occupied 50 percent of the wing-skeleton. The hindlimbs were short compared to the forelimbs, and the feet were as long as the small third finger.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} 1821 paper he co-authored with Henry De la Beche on {{ichthyosaur}} anatomy, William Conybeare named {{and described the}} genus Plesiosaurus (near lizard), called so {{because he thought it}} more like modern reptiles than the ichthyosaur had been. The description was based on a number of fossils, the most complete of them specimen OUMNH J.50146, a paddle and <b>vertebral</b> <b>column</b> that had been obtained by Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch. Christopher McGowan has hypothesised that this specimen had originally been much more complete and had been collected by Anning, during the winter of 1820/1821. If so, it would have been Anning's next major discovery, providing essential information about the newly recognised type of marine reptile. No records by Anning of the find are known. The paper thanked Birch for giving Conybeare access to it, but does not mention who discovered and prepared it.|$|E
5|$|The <b>vertebral</b> <b>column</b> {{consisted}} of ten cervical (neck), twelve dorsal, six fused sacral and {{an unknown number}} of caudal (tail) vertebrae. The neck was nearly straight, rather than having the S-curve seen in other theropods, and also unusually wide, especially towards its base. The top of the neck's spinal column featured a double row of enlarged, upwardly directed bony processes called epipophyses, creating a smooth trough {{on the top of the}} neck vertebrae. These processes were the highest points of the spine, towering above the unusually low spinous processes. The epipophyses probably provided attachment areas for a markedly strong neck musculature. A similar double row was also present in the tail, formed there by highly modified caudal ribs, in front view protruding upwards in a V-shape, their inner sides creating a smooth, flat, top surface of the front tail vertebrae. The end of each caudal rib was furnished with a forward projecting hook-shaped expansion that connected to the caudal rib of the preceding vertebra.|$|E

5|$|The <b>vertebral</b> <b>column</b> was {{composed}} of nine cervical (neck) vertebrae, 13 dorsal (back) vertebrae, three sacral (hip) vertebrae, and at least 40 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The pubis faced forward, as with most saurischians. It had a slighter build than that of Plateosaurus, an otherwise similar dinosaur. The neck was proportionally longer than in most other plateosaurids, with the foremost cervicals being four times {{the length of the}}ir width. The forelimbs were only half the length of the hindlimbs but quite powerful, as indicated by the broad upper end of the humerus that provided attachment areas for a large arm musculature. Like Plateosaurus, it had five digits on each hand and foot. The hand was short and wide, with a large sickle shaped thumb claw used for feeding or defense against predators. The thumb was the longest finger in the hand, while the fourth and fifth digits were tiny, giving the forepaws a lopsided look.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} fish {{is divided}} into a head, trunk and tail, {{although}} the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of cartilage, in cartilaginous fish, or bone in bony fish. The main skeletal element is the <b>vertebral</b> <b>column,</b> composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine {{and there are no}} limbs or limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the fins, are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which {{with the exception of the}} caudal fins, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk. The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop. The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or middle ear. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} {{is reasonably}} complete {{and includes a}} partial skull. Sauropod skull bones are rarely found, and the Amargasaurus skull {{is only the second}} skull known from a member of the Dicraeosauridae. Major parts of the skeleton were found in their original anatomical position: the <b>vertebral</b> <b>column</b> of the neck and back, which consisted of 22 articulated vertebrae, was found connected to both the skull and the sacrum. Of the skull, only the temporal region and the braincase are preserved. The sacrum, despite being partly eroded prior to burial, is fairly complete. Most of the tail is missing, with three anterior, three middle, and one posterior vertebrae being preserved, along with fragments of several others. The shoulder girdle is known from the scapula (shoulder blade) and coracoid (which sits on {{the lower end of the}} scapula), while the pelvis is merely known from the ilium (the uppermost of the three pelvic bones). The limbs are equally fragmentary, with the manus (hand) and most of the pes (foot) missing. The skeleton is currently stored in the collection of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum in Buenos Aires.|$|E
500|$|During the [...] "gap", {{tetrapod}} backbones developed, as did limbs with digits {{and other}} adaptations for terrestrial life.

5000|$|Medical aspects Negative G-force (pressure of {{the blood}} towards the head) is much more {{beneficial}} to the body than positive G-force (the blood runs toward the feet).
