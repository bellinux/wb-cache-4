50|$|In {{its early}} days, KITV and its {{predecessors}} aired {{most of the}} ABC offerings on a one-week delay due to Hawaii's geographical location and at times would receive most of the network shows <b>via</b> <b>air</b> <b>mail.</b> Because of this, the station would program ABC daytime shows from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. in incorrect order (with movies rounding out most the schedule) and ABC primetime shows from 6:30 to 10:30 p.m., again out of pattern (and at times, delayed to weekends) and mixed in with syndicated programs {{to fill in the}} slots. Like most of the Honolulu stations, the network newscast would be delayed as late as midnight as the broadcasts were flown in from the mainland after their airings on the East Coast. This began to change on November 19, 1966, when channel 4 KHVH began broadcasting the first live network satellite telecast from the U.S. mainland to Hawaii as ABC fed a football game between Notre Dame and Michigan State to the station via the Lani Bird satellite. Today, KITV receives ABC shows on the same day {{as the rest of the}} United States, including live news, sports coverage and special events. On February 28, 2016, KITV began airing the Academy Awards live for the first time after delaying the telecast for decades, citing the impact of social media reporting the winners in real time, making it difficult to delay the broadcast for Hawaiian viewers. On February 27, 2017, the station aired that year's ceremony on a tape-delay once again. KITV clears the entire ABC network programming schedule. The only recent exception was for Power Rangers, which was part of the now-defunct ABC Kids block until August 28, 2010. Most (if not all) ABC affiliates owned by Hearst Television (which once owned KITV) refused to clear the show due to its lack of educational and informational content. In the past, KITV also pre-empted some of ABC's daytime programming, which instead aired on then-independent station KAAH-TV.|$|E
50|$|When {{it was a}} NBC affiliate, channel 2 carried most of the network's lineup. The only {{exception}} was The Today Show, which the station had pre-empted since its sign-on due to the program being telecast live at 7 a.m. Eastern (which is 2 a.m. Hawaii time during standard time and 1 a.m. Hawaii time during daylight saving time, which Hawaii does not observe) and Hawaii's geographical location, {{making it difficult to}} deliver a taped broadcast to the islands. As a result, the station would not start its full day of programming until at least 7 a.m., usually with ethnic programming, cartoons, and from 1966 to 1972, an hour of Romper Room. In 1968, KHON would finally air a one-hour taped version of Today but would then drop it a year later. It finally began airing the full two-hour program via same-day satellite in 1972. It also aired NBC programming on a weekly delay with some of its shows airing out of pattern. For instance, it aired NBC Nightly News after 12 Midnight or 6 a.m. the following morning <b>via</b> <b>air</b> <b>mail.</b> The Saturday morning schedule aired on Sunday morning, and Meet the Press aired on Saturday morning on one-week delay. It would not be until 1985 when KHON would start airing NBC programming the same day {{as the rest of the}} mainland United States thanks to newer and updated satellite technology. Since its switch from NBC in 1996, KHON clears the entire Fox network schedule (nightly primetime, Saturday late night, and Fox Sports programming, along with the network's Saturday morning infomerical block, Weekend Marketplace and the political talk show Fox News Sunday). However, the station presently airs Fox's Sunday night programming one hour later than other affiliates, from 7-10 p.m. Hawaii Time (instead of the 6-9 p.m. slot common with other network affiliates in Hawaii), and the network's Animation Domination HD late night lineup on Saturdays airs a half-hour later airing at 10:30 p.m., due to its nightly 10 p.m. newscast. In 2014, KHON launched a half-hour primetime newscast at 9 p.m. on weekdays, followed by a second-run syndicated program, while network programs air in that hour on Sundays (syndicated programs may air in place of network shows if Fox airs a sporting event that is scheduled for primetime on the U.S. mainland, but due to the time differences between Hawaii and the continental United States, airs on KHON earlier that day).|$|E

40|$|The early {{literature}} on the Drosophila-yeast relationship concerns primarily the role of yeast in the nutrition of Drosophila (Northrop, 1917; Loeb and Nor-thrup, 1917). Baumberger (1919) by experiment demonstrated that the pupae of the fruit fly transmitted the yeasts via the intestinal tract. The French work-ers Sergent and Rougebief (1925) investigated the interrelationship of yeast, fruit fly, and grapevine; however, they did not report {{the identity of the}} yeasts encountered in their studies.

40|$|Purpose - Tourism is the {{mainstay}} of most islands within the Caribbean encompassing a great segment of their services industry. However, despite increasing maturity in the research literature about destination competitiveness, analyzing it from the hospitality professional 2 ÃÜ 7 s perspective remains a novel concept in research for destinations in the Caribbean region. In light of this, {{the purpose of this}} study is to identify the distinguishing factors determining the competitiveness of Small Island Destinations within the Caribbean. Specifically, the research examined the features, experiences and strategies that all-inclusive hotels and resorts use to differentiate themselves from other properties within their island and throughout the Caribbean. Another aim of the study is to ascertain hotel managers 2 ÃÜ 7 perceptions regarding the characteristics which differentiate their island as a destination from others within the Caribbean. Importance- The all-inclusive concept is an important experience invention for the Caribbean market place. However, if each island is not able to adequately differentiate itself from its competitors, there is cause for concern - these small Caribbean islands might end up in a situation of fierce competition among each other, while competing individually with other larger destinations. This places each destination (and the region as a whole) in an unfavorable position. Design/Methodology/Approach- Data were collected by means of a self-completion survey administered preliminarily <b>via</b> <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> then by e-mail to hotel managers and professionals of all-inclusive hotels throughout the Caribbean. The survey solicited their perception of the distinguishing features, experiences and strategies that all-inclusive hotels use to compete as well as their opinion about the characteristics that makes their host destination distinct. The study was exploratory in nature and followed a combined descriptive-comparative design. Findings- Hotel Professionals believe that employees play an important role in differentiating their all-inclusive hotel from other properties within the Caribbean. Secondly, according to tourism experts in the region, the natural beauty of the destination and the destination 2 ÃÜ 7 s favorable climate are the main distinguishing characteristics that influence a traveler to visit their island over other destinations within the Caribbean. Since this study highlights these as common resources among all Caribbean destinations, it, therefore, follows that each destination 2 ÃÜ 7 s ability to distinguish itself lies in its volume, range and quality of supporting factors and resources, its destination management strategies, its destination policy, planning and development as well as how it manages its qualifying and amplifying determinants. Research Limitations/Implications- The sample size for this research was relatively small, but was adequate for statistical analysis. The results should be cautiously interpreted as a generalization of the Caribbean and serve more as a springboard for further research and analysis into this vital area. Since this study was focused on one element in the model of destination competitiveness, future research should seek to test all the elements in the model thereby, presenting more comprehensive, systemic view of Caribbean destination competitiveness. The research may also be conducted from other stakeholders 2 ÃÜ 7 viewpoints such as tourists and travel agents. Practical Implications- In order to ensure that individual strategies are tied into the broader competitive strategy for each destination, this study can be useful to tourism planners as it helps them to better understand the approach employed by all-inclusive hotels to differentiate themselves from other properties as well as their perception of host islands 2 ÃÜ 7 differentiation strategies. This understanding of all-inclusive differentiation within the region would also help travel organizers and marketers, like the Caribbean Tourism Organization, to plan, design and deliver products and services that cater to the specific needs of the all-inclusive market, while aiming to highlight the unique attributes of each island destination. This will further help to strengthen the image of each island destination, in particular, and the Caribbean Destination, in general, as they seek to gain complete advantage over other hospitality destinations within the Hospitality and Tourism arena. Originality/value- Destination Planners and particularly Hotel Associations and Professionals will benefit from this study as little research has been carried out to study the topic of destination competitiveness from hotel professionals 2 ÃÜ 7 perspective within the Caribbean. Academic researchers can also build on this for future studies in the Caribbean as there are many more missing rungs in the ladder of literature for the subject matter in this geographic region...|$|E
