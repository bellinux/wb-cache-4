25|$|<b>Vaginismus</b> {{has been}} {{classified}} by Lamont {{according to the}} severity of the condition. Lamont describes four degrees of vaginismus: In first degree <b>vaginismus,</b> the patient has spasm of the pelvic floor that can be relieved with reassurance. In second degree, the spasm is present but maintained throughout the pelvis even with reassurance. In third degree, the patient elevates the buttocks to avoid being examined. In fourth degree <b>vaginismus</b> (also known as grade 4 <b>vaginismus),</b> the most severe form of <b>vaginismus,</b> the patient elevates the buttocks, retreats and tightly closes the thighs to avoid examination. Pacik expanded the Lamont classification to include a fifth degree in which the patient experiences a visceral reaction such as sweating, hyperventilation, palpitations, trembling, shaking, nausea, vomiting, losing consciousness, wanting to jump off the table, or attacking the doctor. The Lamont classification continues to be used to the present and allows for a common language among researchers and therapists.|$|E
25|$|Primary <b>vaginismus</b> {{is often}} idiopathic.|$|E
25|$|A {{woman with}} <b>vaginismus</b> does not {{consciously}} control the spasm. The vaginismic reflex {{can be compared}} to the response of the eye shutting when an object comes towards it. The severity of <b>vaginismus,</b> as well as the pain during penetration (including sexual penetration), varies from woman to woman.|$|E
25|$|According to Ward and Ogden's {{qualitative}} {{study on the}} experience of <b>vaginismus</b> (1994), the three most common contributing factors to <b>vaginismus</b> are fear of painful sex; the belief that sex is wrong or shameful (often the case with patients who had a strict religious upbringing); and traumatic early childhood experiences (not necessarily sexual in nature).|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} infections, {{diseases}} and disorders {{that can affect}} the vagina, including candidal vulvovaginitis, vaginitis, <b>vaginismus,</b> sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or cancer. Vaginitis is an inflammation of the vagina, and is attributed to several vaginal diseases, while <b>vaginismus</b> is an involuntary tightening of the vagina muscles caused by a conditioned reflex, or disease, during vaginal penetration. HIV/AIDS, human papillomavirus (HPV), genital herpes and trichomoniasis {{are some of the}} STIs that may affect the vagina, and health sources recommend safe sex (or barrier method) practices to prevent the transmission of these and other STIs.|$|E
25|$|A Cochrane review {{found little}} high quality {{evidence}} regarding {{the treatment of}} <b>vaginismus</b> in 2012. Specifically it is unclear if systematic desensitisation is better than other measures including nothing.|$|E
25|$|True {{epidemiological}} studies of <b>vaginismus</b> {{have not been}} done, as diagnosis would require painful examinations that such women would most likely avoid. Data available is primarily reported statistics from clinical settings.|$|E
25|$|Sexual pain {{disorders}} affect women {{almost exclusively}} {{and are also}} known as dyspareunia (painful intercourse) or <b>vaginismus</b> (an involuntary spasm of {{the muscles of the}} vaginal wall that interferes with intercourse).|$|E
25|$|People with <b>vaginismus</b> {{are twice}} as likely to have a history of {{childhood}} sexual interference and held less positive attitudes about their sexuality, whereas no correlation was noted for lack of sexual knowledge or (non-sexual) physical abuse.|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} <b>vaginismus</b> in people in Morocco and Sweden found a {{prevalence}} of 6%. 18-20% {{of people in}} British and Australian studies {{were found to have}} manifest dyspareunia, while the rate among elderly British people was as low as 2%.|$|E
25|$|Obtaining a pap smear {{should not}} cause much pain, {{but it can}} if the woman has certain {{untreated}} vaginal problems such as cervical stenosis or <b>vaginismus,</b> or if the person performing it is too harsh, or uses the wrong size speculum.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} study-based {{estimates}} of <b>vaginismus</b> incidence range from 5% to 47% of people presenting for sex therapy or complaining of sexual problems, with significant differences across cultures. It {{seems likely that}} a society's expectations of person's sexuality may particularly impact on {{the people with the}} condition.|$|E
25|$|A 1990 {{study of}} people {{presenting}} to sex therapy clinics found reported <b>vaginismus</b> rates of between 12% and 17%, while a random sampling and structured interview survey conducted in 1994 by National Health and Sexual Life Survey documented 10%-15% of people {{reported that in}} the past six months they had experienced pain during intercourse.|$|E
25|$|It {{consists}} of two questionnaires (i.e. a male and a female questionnaire) with 28 items each. It studies sexual dysfunctions in heterosexual subjects. It provides a total score and subscales scores: intercourse frequency, incommunicability, dissatisfaction, avoiding sexual intercourse, absence of sexuality, anorgasmia and <b>vaginismus</b> (only in the female version), impotence and premature ejaculation (only in the male version).|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} exactly what causes <b>vaginismus,</b> {{but it is}} thought that past sexual trauma (such as rape or abuse) may play a role. Another female sexual pain {{disorder}} is called vulvodynia or vulvar vestibulitis. In this condition, women experience burning pain during sex which seems to be related to problems with the skin in the vulvar and vaginal areas. The cause is unknown.|$|E
25|$|In {{defining}} {{the range of}} sexual problems Masters and Johnson defined a boundary between dysfunction and deviations. Dysfunctions were transitory and experienced {{by the majority of}} people, dysfunctions bounded male primary or secondary impotence, premature ejaculation, ejaculatory incompetence; female primary orgasmic dysfunction and situational orgasmic dysfunction; pain during intercourse (dyspareunia) and <b>vaginismus.</b> According to Masters and Johnson sexual arousal and climax are a normal physiological process of every functionally intact adult, but despite being autonomic it can be inhibited. Masters and Johnson treatment program for dysfunction was 81.1% successful.|$|E
2500|$|Secondary <b>vaginismus</b> {{occurs when}} {{a person who has}} {{previously}} been able to achieve penetration develops <b>vaginismus.</b> This may be due to physical causes such as a yeast infection or trauma during childbirth, while in some cases it may be due to psychological causes, or to a combination of causes. The treatment for secondary <b>vaginismus</b> is the same as for primary <b>vaginismus,</b> although, in these cases, previous experience with successful penetration can assist in a more rapid resolution of the condition. Peri-menopausal and menopausal <b>vaginismus,</b> often due to a drying of the vulvar and vaginal tissues as a result of reduced estrogen, may occur as a result of [...] "micro-tears" [...] first causing sexual pain then leading to <b>vaginismus.</b>|$|E
2500|$|If someone {{suspects}} {{they have}} <b>vaginismus,</b> sexual penetration {{is likely to}} remain painful or truly impossible until their <b>vaginismus</b> is addressed. This is a highly frustrating condition, as other people, including doctors, may speculate negatively on the origin or existence of their difficulties. <b>Vaginismus</b> does not mean that someone does not want intercourse or does not love their partner. People with <b>vaginismus</b> may be able to engage in a variety of other sexual activities, as long as penetration is avoided. Sexual partners of vaginismic people may come to believe that vaginismic people do not want to engage in penetrative sex at all, though this may not be true for most such people. There is currently no indication that <b>vaginismus</b> reduces the sexual drive or arousal of affected people, and as such it is likely that many vaginismic people wish to engage in penetrative sex to the same degree as unaffected people, but are deterred by the pain and emotional distress that accompanies each attempt. Psychological pressure to [...] "perform" [...] sexually or become aroused quickly with a partner can deter the person from future attempts and/or cause their <b>vaginismus</b> to become more severe.|$|E
2500|$|Often, {{when faced}} with a person {{experiencing}} painful intercourse, a gynecologist will recommend Kegel exercises and provide some additional lubricants. Strengthening the muscles that unconsciously tighten during <b>vaginismus</b> may be extremely counter-intuitive for some people. Although <b>vaginismus</b> has not been shown to affect a person's ability to produce lubrication, providing additional lubricant can be helpful in achieving successful penetration. This {{is due to the fact}} that women may not produce natural lubrication if anxious or in pain. Treatment of <b>vaginismus</b> may involve the use Hegar dilators, (sometimes called vaginal trainers) [...] progressively increasing the size of the dilator inserted into the vagina.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{factors that}} may {{contribute}} to either Secondary or Primary <b>Vaginismus</b> include: ...|$|E
2500|$|A few of {{the main}} factors that may {{contribute}} to primary <b>vaginismus</b> include: ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{woman is}} said to have primary <b>vaginismus</b> [...] when she is unable to have penetrative sex or {{experience}} vaginal penetration without pain. It is commonly discovered in teenage girls and women in their early twenties, as this is when many girls and young women first attempt to use tampons, have penetrative sex, or undergo a Pap smear. Women with <b>vaginismus</b> may be unaware of the condition until they attempt vaginal penetration. A woman may be unaware of the reasons for her condition.|$|E
2500|$|Although the pubococcygeus {{muscle is}} {{commonly}} {{thought to be}} the primary muscle involved in <b>vaginismus,</b> Pacik identified two additionally-involved spastic muscles in treated patients under sedation. These include the entry muscle (bulbocavernosum) and the mid-vaginal muscle (puborectalis). Spasm of the entry muscle accounts for the common complaint that patients often report when trying to have intercourse: [...] "It's like hitting a brick wall".|$|E
2500|$|These {{associations}} {{can lead}} to negative emotions arising during any kind of sexual expression, including masturbation, and these emotions can take time to process. Feelings of shame, inadequacy or a fear of being [...] "defective" [...] can be deeply troubling. If multiple attempts at penetration are made before treating <b>vaginismus,</b> it may lead to fear of sexual intercourse, and worsen the amount of pain experienced with each subsequent attempt. Relaxation, patience and self-acceptance are vital to a pleasurable experience.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Vaginismus,</b> {{sometimes}} called vaginism, {{is a condition}} that affects a woman's ability to engage in vaginal penetration, including sexual intercourse, manual penetration, insertion of tampons or menstrual cups, and the penetration involved in gynecological examinations (pap tests). This {{is the result of}} an involuntary vaginal muscle spasm, which makes any kind of vaginal penetration painful or impossible. While {{there is a lack of}} evidence to definitively identify which muscle is responsible for the spasm, the pubococcygeus muscle, sometimes referred to as the [...] "PC muscle", is most often suggested. Other muscles such as the levator ani, bulbocavernosus, circumvaginal, and perivaginal muscles have also been suggested.|$|E
2500|$|An inveterate prankster, {{he wrote}} several humorous pieces under the {{pseudonym}} [...] "Egerton Yorrick Davis", even fooling {{the editors of}} the Philadelphia Medical News into publishing a report on the extremely rare phenomenon of penis captivus, on December 13, 1884. The letter was apparently a response to a report on the phenomenon of <b>vaginismus</b> reported three weeks previously in the Philadelphia Medical News by Osler’s colleague Theophilus Parvin. Davis, a prolific writer of letters to medical societies, purported to be a retired U.S. Army surgeon living in Caughnawaga, Quebec (now Kahnawake), author of a controversial paper on the obstetrical habits of Native American tribes that was suppressed and unpublished. Osler would enhance Davis's myth by signing Davis's name to hotel registers and medical conference attendance lists; Davis was eventually reported drowned in the Lachine Rapids in 1884.|$|E

50|$|<b>Vaginismus</b> is {{involuntary}} tensing of the {{pelvic floor}} musculature, making coitus, or {{any form of}} penetration of the vagina, distressing, painful and sometimes impossible for women. It is a conditioned reflex of the pubococcygeus muscle, and is {{sometimes referred to as}} the PC muscle. <b>Vaginismus</b> can be hard to overcome because if a woman expects to experience pain during sexual intercourse, this can cause a muscle spasm, which results in painful sexual intercourse. Treatment of <b>vaginismus</b> often includes both psychological and behavioral techniques, including the use of vaginal dilators. Additionally, the use of Botox as a medical treatment for <b>vaginismus</b> has been tested and administered. Painful or uncomfortable sexual intercourse may also be categorized as dyspareunia.|$|E

50|$|Penis captivus {{is a rare}} {{occurrence}} in intercourse when the muscles in the vagina clamp down on the penis much more firmly than usual (a form of <b>vaginismus),</b> {{making it impossible for}} the penis to withdraw from the vagina. According to a 1979 article in the British Medical Journal, this condition was unknown in the twentieth century, but a subsequent letter to the same journal reported an apparent case of penis captivus in 1947. Penis captivus {{should not be confused with}} <b>vaginismus,</b> though a relation between the supposed event of penis captivus and the occurrence of <b>vaginismus</b> is assumed in the existing descriptions.|$|E
