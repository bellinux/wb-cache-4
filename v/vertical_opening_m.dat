Various designs and sizes of pelagic trawls and techniques {{are used in}} the pelagic zone by Norwegian research vessels for this purpose. This paper describes trawl designs used for O-group surveys and a larger trawl used for adult fish. The largest trawl, which has a <b>vertical</b> <b>opening</b> of 30 <b>m</b> when towed at 3. 5 - 4 knots, can be rigged for close-to-surface trawling as well as for rnid- and deep-water trawling with minor adjustment of the rigging. The performance of the various trawls is described, based on geometric measurements using Scanmar instruments and observations with a TV-camera in a towed underwater vehicle. The trawl mouth area of the O-group trawl is approximately 10 x 10 m, and it can be rigged to catch efficiently in all depths from surface downwards. The large pelagic trawl is rigged with large surface buoys and lenghtened upper bridles when used in the surface layer to sample herring and mackerel...|$|R

40|$|The {{spatial pattern}} of fish assemblages and its {{relationship}} with factors along an environment gradient, from fresh to marine water environment along the Río de la Plata estuary (36 ºS, 56 ºW) the shelf {{and part of the}} slope, was examined using data from 22 sampling stations. Fish were sampled from all station with an Engel type trawl (200 mm stretched mesh in the wings, 120 mm stretched mesh in the cod ends, 4 <b>m</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>opening</b> and 15 <b>m</b> horizontal aperture) towed at 4 knots for 20 to 30 min per set. Cluster analysis and ordination analysis MDS were used to define spatial distribution of fish assemblages based on fish composition (abundance and biomass). BIO-ENV process was used to estimate assemblage association with depth, temperature and salinity of surface and bottom waters. The results of these analyses showed that the fish community along the riverine-marine gradient was structured in four assemblages: riverine, estuarine, shelf and slope. These assemblages were found to differ significantly in their species composition. Each assemblage was characterized by several common and discriminator species and characterized by differing environmental conditions. Bottom salinity and bottom temperature were the environmental variables most strongly associated with differences in assemblage structure across the various areas. The changes in assemblage structure between areas were gradual, with no sharp boundaries...|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} a 31 m two-seam trawl was tested in a towing tank. The {{horizontal}} and <b>vertical</b> <b>openings</b> and warp tension were measured at various speeds.

40|$|In a {{co-operation}} {{project of}} Wageningen University (Wageningen UR), Agrotechnology & Food Innovations B. V. (A&F), Priva Hortimation B. V. and Hyplast N. V. (Belgium) a greenhouse {{for the future}} has been developed. The project has four lines, namely 1. lowering the energy demand, 2. using solar energy for heating (greenhouse as solar collector), 3. modifying climate control and dehumidification and 4. developing of the highly insulated greenhouse. This paper deals {{with the development of}} the so-called Solar Greenhouse, the structure and cladding material and the (natural) ventilation openings. The aspects that {{play an important role in}} the process of development of the greenhouse are the strength of the structure, the light transmittance, the material consumption and the expected greenhouse climate. The high demands for energy savings lead to a greenhouse covering with a high insulation value and at the same time a high light transmittance. Advanced materials like fluor polymer films in double or more layers with the space in between inflated have these qualities. The most perspective greenhouse geometry is a saw-tooth roof structure with roof inclinations of 200 and 300, a span width of 10 <b>m</b> and a <b>vertical</b> <b>opening</b> of 2 <b>m</b> for natural ventilation. The module for the greenhouse is repeatable in both directions to a big area.

The {{purpose of these}} studies {{was to determine whether}} the extent of <b>vertical</b> <b>opening,</b> contralateral occlusal support, or head posture influenced vertical occlusal forces during swallowing, simulated chewing, and maximum biting effort. Three samples of subjects with normal vertical facial proportions - one each of children, adolescents, and young adults - were evaluated {{to determine the effects of}} changes in small (2. 5 vs. 6. 0 mm) vertical separation of the first molars. A sample of young adults was used to evaluate changes in large (10 - 40 mm) <b>vertical</b> <b>openings,</b> and a sample of adolescents was used to investigate the effect of contralateral support and head posture. All between-group comparisons were evaluated using non-parametric statistics. For the small <b>vertical</b> <b>openings,</b> there was significantly more vertical occlusal force at 6. 0 than 2. 5 mm in children during swallowing and chewing but not during maximum biting effort. In adults, there was significantly more force during swallowing at 6. 0 than at 2. 5 mm separation, but no differences in chewing or maximum biting. Increasingly large <b>vertical</b> <b>openings</b> resulted in a progressive increase in maximum bite force to a maximum at about 20 mm, followed by a decrease and then a second increase to near-maximum force at about 40 mm for young adults. There were no significant differences in vertical force with or without contralateral support or between flexed, normal, and extended head postures at either of the small openings...|$|R

40|$|The {{buoyancy}} induced turbulent {{flows in}} ventilated enclosure with internal heat source has important applications in building ventilations, solar energy receivers, thermal management of electronic devices and enclosure fire dynamics. In naturally ventilated buildings, the fluid flow is mainly driven by buoyancy and air exchange through ventilation openings provides thermal comfort for building occupants. During fire accidents in buildings and in long tunnels, larger temperature difference induces strong buoyant plumes {{and the hot}} gas flow characteristics are important {{for the design of}} fire safety and ventilation systems. The air flow patterns through <b>vertical</b> <b>openings</b> such as doorways and windows are widely studied but very few investigations are performed with horizontal or ceiling openings. The horizontal vents are openings in ceilings, floors or smoke vent at roof top.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a double-skin porous façade system on the wind-induced {{response}} of the Commonwealth Advisory Aeronautical Research Council (CAARC) Standard Tall Building were investigated via a program of wind tunnel model study conducted at the China Light and Power (CLP) Power Wind/Wave Tunnel Facility at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. For reduced wind velocities ranging from about 4 to 14, the dynamic alongwind, crosswind and torsional responses of the building were reduced significantly when <b>vertical</b> <b>openings</b> {{were introduced to the}} outer skin of the double-skin façade. The reduction in crosswind response at around the critical reduced velocity associated with vortex shedding when the incident wind was normal to the windward face of the building is particularly striking. These response reductions are attributable to the disruption to the vortex shedding process caused by channelling air flow created by <b>vertical</b> <b>opening(s)</b> and the double-skin façade system.

40|$|Common {{shrimp trawl}} designs {{employed}} in the southeastern United States shrimp fishery are the flat, balloon, semiballoon, jib, and super X- 3. Recent innovations in trawl design and rigging, including the twin trawl rigging and tongue trawl design, have improved the efficiency of shrimp trawling gear. A description of the construction techniques for the different designs indicate differences which affect gear performance. Measurements of horizontal spread and <b>vertical</b> <b>opening</b> for 76 trawl configurations indicate the relative efficiencies of the different designs. Maximum horizontal spreading efficiency was achieved by the "twin" and "tongue" trawl designs followed by the super X- 3, jib, balloon, and semiballoon designs. Designs having the greatest <b>vertical</b> <b>openings</b> were the tongue and flat trawl designs followed by the semiballoon. Maximum total gape dimension was demonstrated by the "Mongoose" tongue trawl. Comparison of trawl spreading efficiency and door area to headrope length ratio indicates that a range of 70 - 80 in square (per door) of door area is required for each foot of trawl headrope length for maximum efficiency with conventional trawl designs and 66 - 75 in square per foot of headrope for tongue trawl designs.
