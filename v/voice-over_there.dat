5000|$|Cinéma vérité ( [...] ; [...] "truthful cinema") is a {{style of}} {{documentary}} filmmaking, invented by Jean Rouch, inspired by Dziga Vertov's theory about Kino-Pravda and influenced by Robert Flaherty’s films. It combines improvisation {{with the use of}} the camera to unveil truth or highlight subjects hidden behind crude reality.It is sometimes called observational cinema, if understood as pure direct cinema: mainly without a narrator's <b>voice-over.</b> <b>There</b> are subtle, yet important, differences among terms expressing similar concepts. Direct Cinema is largely concerned with the recording of events in which the subject and audience become unaware of the camera's presence: operating within what Bill Nichols, an American historian and theoretician of documentary film, calls the [...] "observational mode", a fly on the wall. Many therefore see a paradox in drawing attention away from the presence of the camera and simultaneously interfering in the reality it registers when attempting to discover a cinematic truth.|$|E

In the TV version, there's no narration, some of the audio differs, and the hayride scene plays intact, complete with a crossover from the Bride of Frankenstein cow who was featured {{at the beginning of the}} special.|$|R
50|$|Film noir is {{especially}} {{associated with the}} voice-over technique. The golden age of first-person narration was in the 1940s. The term Film noir was coined by the French film critics, Nino Frank the first among them in 1946. More often than not, the plot of a Film Noir evolved around a cynical, hard-hearted, disillusioned male character accompanied with a narrative voiceover. Film noir typically used male <b>voice-over</b> narration but <b>there</b> are a few rare female voice-overs.|$|R
