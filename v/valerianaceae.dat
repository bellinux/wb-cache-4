50|$|Valeriana wallichii, {{the major}} {{species of the}} genus Valeriana is native to India. Nepal and China. As an {{important}} substitute for the European V. officinalis, it has been traditionally used in treatment of sleep problems, obesity, nervous disorders and snake poisoning and skin diseases. Uttarakhand, part of Indian North western Himalaya, represents a mountainous region that encompasses agroclimatic conditions ranging from tropical to alpine and, thus, possesses a rich biodiversity. Valeriana, the major genus in the family <b>Valerianaceae,</b> is characterized by perennials that have three stamens without spurs on the slightly swollen base of the corolla, with a short and often strong-smelling root stalk. Strachey reported in 1918 the occurrence of five Valeriana species, V. dioica L., V. pyrolaefolia, V. stracheyi, V. wallichii DC., and V. hardwickii, at elevations ranging from 1500 ± 4300 m. A re-investigation of the morphology, distribution, and biodiversity of the Indian <b>Valerianaceae,</b> however, showed a total of 16 species/subspecies, of which six, namely V. wallichii DC.

Sequence data from three chloroplast markers (psbA-trnH intron, trnK-matK intron, and the trnL-F region) along with the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA were used to infer relationships within <b>Valerianaceae.</b> Both genomes, as well as a combined data set, provide support for the major clades within the group and do not support a monophyletic Valeriana. In addition, these data indicate that Plectritis is nested within South American Valeriana, as opposed to being sister to Centhranthus as previously hypothesized. <b>Valerianaceae</b> appear to have originated in Asia, probably in the Himalayas, and subsequently to have dispersed several times to Europe and to the New World. Our results imply that <b>Valerianaceae</b> colonized South America on multiple occasions from the north.

40|$|AbstractThe Morinaceae (Dipsacales) {{contains}} 13 species {{placed in}} Acanthocalyx, Cryptothladia or Morina, and is distributed {{from the mountains}} of southeastern Europe through the Himalayas to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, mainly in alpine habitats. Sequence data from two chloroplast regions (the trnK intron and the trnL-F region) and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA were used to infer phylogenetic relationships of Morinaceae and related Dipsacales. Both the nuclear and chloroplast datasets, {{as well as the}} combined data, provide strong support for relationships within the Valerina clade, placing Morinaceae as the sister group of a clade containing <b>Valerianaceae</b> and Dipsacaceae plus Triplostegia. The Morinaceae, Acanthocalyx, Cryptothladia, and a clade containing Morina and Cryptothladia, are all supported as monophyletic. However, Morina was found to be paraphyletic in several of our analyses, with Morina longifolia more closely related to Cryptothladia than to other Morina species. There is some evidence that Morina longifolia produces cleistogamous flowers, as do Cryptothladia species. Dispersal-vicariance analyses support the view that Valerina radiated initially within Asia, with subsequent movement into Europe in Morinaceae, Dipsacaceae, and <b>Valerianaceae,</b> and into the New World in <b>Valerianaceae.</b> For Morinaceae, as for a number of plant groups, the Brahmaputra river drainage marks a significant biogeographic divide, although this has been spanned within Acanthocalyx and the Morina-Cryptothladia lineage...|$|E

Identification of these compounds which are known as reliable markers in <b>Valerianaceae</b> family was achieved using TLC and UV-spectrophotometry methods. Valerenic acid makes substantial contribution to the sedative effect of valerian. Separation of valerenic acid and its derivatives was performed by TLC using a ternary mobile phase of hexane-ethyl acetate-glacial acetic acid (65 : 35 : 0. 5 v/v) on silica gel HF 254 + 366 plates. Spots were detected at 254 and 366 nm and then revelation of them was carried out with HCl-acetic acid reagent followed by anisaldehyde-sulphuric acid reagent spraying at visible light. Quantitative analysis of valerenic acid and its derivatives was performed using UV-spectrophotometry. The calibration curve of authentic valerenic acid was linear in the range of 2 - 51 mg L - 1. Additionally, for a more accurate determination of total valerenic acid derivatives (including valerenic acid, hydroxyvalerenic acid and acetoxyvalerenic acid) extinction coefficient of each compound in ethanol was used. This is the first report for the identification and quantification of valerenic acid derivatives in all organs of Valeriana sisymbriifolia, Valeriana alliariifolia and Centranthus longiflorus in comparison with those of commercial Valeriana officinalis. Total valerenic acid derivatives content in different organs of these Iranian wild species ranged from 0. 06 - 1. 11 % (D. W.).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} some Iranian wild species of <b>Valerianaceae</b> with respect to their contents of valepotriates. Identification of these compounds which are known as reliable markers in <b>Valerianaceae</b> family was achieved using TLC and UV-spectrophotometry methods. Valepotriates makes substantial contribution to the sedative effect of valerian. Separation of these compounds was performed by TLC using a ternary mobile phase of toluene-ethyl acetate - methyl ethyl ketone (80 : 15 : 5 v/v) on silica gel HF 254 + 366 plates. Separated bands were observed in ultraviolet light at 254 nm. For bands revelation, 2, 4 - dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) solution spray was used at visible light. For the quantitative determination of valepotriates a standardized product (Valmane ®) was used to plot two calibration curves. One calibration curve was drawn in the concentration range of 5 - 156 mg L - 1 for determination of valtrate + acevaltrate amounts. The second one was linear in the range of 5 - 52 mg L - 1 for didrovaltrate quantification. The qualitative and quantitative determinations were carried out in all organs of Valeriana sisymbriifolia Vahl, Valeriana alliariifolia Adams and Centranthus longiflorus Stev.

Results showed that didrovaltrate amounts (dry weight basis) ranged from 0. 13 % in inflorescence of V. alliariifolia to 3. 51 % in leaf of C. longiflorus. Also acevaltrate + valtrate contents varied from minimum 0. 06 % in stem of V. sisymbriifolia to maximum 10. 85 % in root of V. alliariifolia.
