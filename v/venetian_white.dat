50|$|Aperol Spritz {{became popular}} in the 1950s, {{inspired}} by the <b>Venetian</b> mix of <b>white</b> wine and soda. The drink incorporates the Italian aperitif Aperol, which originated in Padua, Italy, in 1919 as a light liqueur alternative.|$|R

5000|$|The Red Coat {{has evolved}} from being the British infantryman's {{normally}} worn uniform to a garment retained only for ceremonial purposes. Its official adoption dates from February 1645, when the Parliament of England passed the New Model Army ordinance. The new English Army was formed of 22,000 men, divided into 12 foot regiments of 600 men each, one dragoon regiment of 1000 men, and the artillery, consisting of 900 guns. The infantry regiments wore coats of <b>Venetian</b> red with <b>white</b> facings. A contemporary comment on the New Model Army dated 7 May 1645 stated [...] "the men are Redcoats all, the whole army only are distinguished by the several facings of their coats".|$|R
60|$|But she, {{when she}} appeared, {{was not in}} mourning. He fancied that she wore the lustrous black silk, with the breadths of <b>white</b> <b>Venetian</b> lace about the neck which he had praised, because he praised it. Her cheeks burned with a Jacqueminot crimson; what should be white in her face was chalky white. She carried a plumed ostrich fan, black and soft, and after giving him her hand, sat down and waved it to and fro slowly, as he remembered her doing the night they first met. She had no ideas, except such as related intimately to herself, {{and she had no}} gabble, like Mela; and she let him talk. It was past the day when she promised herself she would forgive him; but as he talked on she felt all her passion for him revive, and the {{conflict}} of desires, the desire to hate, the desire to love, made a dizzying whirl in her brain. She looked at him, half doubting whether he was really there or not. He had never looked so handsome, with his dreamy eyes floating under his heavy overhanging hair, and his pointed brown beard defined against his lustrous shirtfront. His mellowly modulated, mysterious voice lulled her; when Mela made an errand out of the room, and Beaton crossed to her and sat down by her, she shivered.|$|R
50|$|Verduzzo Trevigiano is a <b>white</b> <b>Venetian</b> grape {{variety that}} is {{grown in the}} Eastern Veneto wine area (northeast of Italy). In the past the name Verduz {{referred}} {{to a wide range}} of grape varieties in the Venetian area. By the descriptions found, they were often morphologically very different, but shared the character of late ripening. However we can very frequently find the name Verduzzo in the ampelographic list of the 19th century, there is not any sign of this Verduzzo until the beginning of the 20th century. At that time just two varieties, with the same name Verduzzo, were still coltivated in the Veneto and Friuli area, they were what we today call Verduzzo Friulano and Verduzzo Trevigiano. The two varieties are cleary different, as demonstrated even with DNA profiling analysies in 2010 and 2011.However at the beginning of the 20th century, the two Verduzzo were called with the same name and often were present in the same vineyard and made wine together. Cosmo proposed to call the two varieties with different names, Verduzzo friulano for the varieties typical of Ramandolo production that was the only one present in that area of Friuli, and Verduzzo Trevigiano for the other one, that was present in the oriental zone of Veneto, where even Verduzzo friulano was spread, but which has a sure origin in the Treviso province how showed by the papers of Lepido Rocco.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} Shakespeare?s drama, Othello. In the thesis, the writer learns that Othello is a tragic hero who is {{trapped in a}} {{situation}} of struggle. It is the struggle of Othello as a Moor mercenary soldier who lives in the middle of racist white society in order to get self-esteem. Here, the thesis writer wants to know Othello?s struggle in getting his self-esteem, which leads to his downfall. The purpose of writing this thesis is to show Othello?s struggle in getting his self-esteem, which leads to his downfall. The writer uses the psychoanalysis in the interaction among the id, the ego, and the superego as the theory in analyzing it. Thus, the thesis writer concludes that all of the struggles, which are done by Othello, are the realization of the interaction among the id, the ego, and the superego of Othello?s personality in order to seek self-esteem. In the first struggle for self-esteem, Othello?s struggle to win the war in order to win the trust and the acknowledgment from his white society is successfully done and he can get his self-esteem by being promoted as the general in Venetian army. In the second struggle in order to win the acknowledgment on his marriage with white Desdemona, Othello can also get his self-esteem by marrying <b>white</b> <b>Venetian</b> lady, Desdemona. Unfortunately, in maintaining the marriage, Othello fails. He kills his wife to get his self-esteem but finally he ends up committing suicide because he finds out that the accusation of the betrayal toward his wife is not right at all...|$|R

The lieges wear European shirts, stuffed into a waist-cloth of cheaper material, calico or domestics; This Tángá, or kilt, is, in fact, an article of general wear, and it would be an airy, comfortable, and wholesome travelling costume if the material were flannel. The ornaments are necklaces of <b>Venetian</b> beads, the <b>white</b> pound, and the black and yellow seed: Canutille or bugles of various patterns are preferred, and all are loaded with [...] "Mengo," [...] Grígrís (which old travellers call [...] "gregories"), or talismans, chiefly leopards' teeth, rude bells, and horns. The Monda are hunting prophylacteries, antelope horns filled with [...] "fetish" [...] medicines, leopard's hair, burnt and powdered heart mixed with leaves, and filth; the mouths are stopped with some viscid black stuff, probably gum. They are often attached to rude bells of iron or brass (Igelenga, Ngenge, Nkendo, or Wonga), like the Chingufu of the Congo regions and the metal cones which are struck for signals upon the Tanganyika Lake.|$|R
