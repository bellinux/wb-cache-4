5000|$|It is best {{practice}} to delay replastering and redecoration {{for as long}} as possible following rising damp treatment, but this obviously creates inconvenience to the occupants of the affected building. BRE Digest 245 states that [...] "While the wall should be allowed to dry {{for as long as}} possible, replastering can follow, providing porous decorations are selected. These are usually matt emulsions and water-based paints, both of which will allow the wall to breathe. Application of gloss and <b>vinyl</b> <b>paints</b> or wallpapers should be delayed for at least one year." ...|$|R
50|$|Ayres' {{early works}} are {{typically}} made with thin <b>vinyl</b> <b>paint</b> {{in a limited}} number of colours arranged in relatively simple forms, but later works in oil paint are more exuberant and very colourful, with a thick impasto being used. The titles of her paintings, such as Anthony and Cleopatra (1982) and A Midsummer Night (1990), are usually given after the painting is completed and do not directly describe the content of the painting, but rather are intended to resonate with the general mood of the work.|$|E
5000|$|The {{monster in}} the film was {{designed}} and portrayed by actor Robinson, who would later star in General Hospital.According to Robinson, {{the design of the}} beast, which he nicknamed [...] "Humphrass", was based on a wingless hangingfly. In order to create the creature's skeletal form, Robinson added aluminum stripping to a plywood base, then covered the frame with chicken wire before wrapping it in sheets and muslin. He then soaked the frame in <b>vinyl</b> <b>paint</b> in order to waterproof the design, since it had {{to be used in the}} snow. The creature's head was fashioned out of quarter-inch aluminum wire, which was then encased in steel wire and wrapped in muslin. The creature's fangs and teeth were also constructed with aluminum wire. Robinson then placed putty and patches of crepe hair onto the design before adding spun glass in order to give it a cobwebby appearance.|$|E
5000|$|Once the {{interior}} scaffolding was installed, a thorough evaluative survey of {{the interior}} coatings was executed. The acknowledged presumption of most involved in the restoration was that all coatings would {{be removed from the}} interior metals, that repairs would be made, that metals would be recoated, and the interior would be adequately weatherproofed. The preexisting interior coatings on both the secondary wrought iron framework and the wrought iron central pylon would be removed along with the multiple layers of coal tar and paint that had been applied to the internal copper sheathing. A New York Times article from February 8, 1984, mentioned that the interior copper which was at that time painted [...] "government green" [...] would be cleaned to resemble the salmon color of a new penny. That outermost [...] "government green" [...] layer was a <b>vinyl</b> <b>paint</b> applied in 1975. Because certain sections that had corroded were hidden beneath the layers of coatings, no attempt was made to salvage any of the seven layers of paint, (consisting of a base coat of red lead primer plus six additional coats) and the two layers of bituminous paint (a coal tar coating) that had been used as a water sealant in the statues interior around 1911. The three available coating removal methods tested, developed (or not) and implemented (or not) were: thermal coating removal, abrasive coating removal and chemical coating removal. The methods contemplated for the removal of the coatings on the interior copper differed from that of the other interior metals. For the preparation of the wrought iron parts of the statue, an abrasive removal method also known as dry sandblasting was implemented in order to prevent against flash rusting, The low dusting abrasive material used in the dry sandblasting technique was aluminum oxide.|$|E

40|$|The American sculptor, David Smith {{is widely}} {{known for his}} welded steel constructions, but his work is also {{characterized}} by an enduring conversation between drawing and sculpture. Although it has for many years been assumed (erroneously) that Smith only used a self-created mixture of egg yolk and black ink in the abstract calligraphic drawings that he made during the 1950 s, new {{research has demonstrated that}} in fact Smith utilised a variety of modern paints and resins to nuance his work on paper. The following article illustrates Smith’s use of modern paints by touching briefly on a number of examples where Smith used the expressive potential of alkyds, acrylics and <b>vinyl</b> <b>paints</b> in his work, and discusses the importance of their identification both for their preservation and for the enrichment of our understanding of his work...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} part of a {{research}} project dealing with the establishment of monitoring and damage prevention plans for contemporary artworks. For this purpose, some commercial paints, among the most currently used by young artists, were selected: Winton oil paint (Winsor & Newton, UK), Heavy Body acrylic paint (Liquitex, USA) and Flashe <b>vinyl</b> <b>paint</b> (Lefranc & Bourgeois, France). The paints were subjected to different treatments of accelerated ageing, the results indicating different behaviour in relation both to the type of binders and pigments present in the different formulations. In particular, it was observed that ageing produced by ozone {{plays an important role in}} the stability of the oil paints, above all in those containing organic azo pigments. Thermal ageing, as expected, influences the stability of all the commercial paints examined, with the formation of alteration products and visible changes in the paint films. Ageing produced by moisture clearly affects the synthetic polymer-based paints, particularly evident in the changes in mass. In all cases, the accelerated ageing treatments produced chromatic variations, more evidently for the oil paints containing organic pigment...|$|E

A commercial grade bicarbonate of soda (baking soda), manufactured by Arm & Hammer was donated and applied as the cleaning agent that would be abrasive yet gentle on the copper sheathing. The baking soda leaked through the holes and crevices in the sheathing, and was affecting the coloration of the patina on the external side of the statue so the workers would rinse the outer surface of the statue, to prevent the baking soda from turning the green patina of the statue blue.|$|R
