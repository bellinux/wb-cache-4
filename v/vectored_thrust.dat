The P.1154 was cancelled in February 1965 and XA896 was scrapped before being converted.|$|E
5|$|In November 1962, Rolls-Royce {{offered a}} PCB-equipped <b>vectored</b> <b>thrust</b> twin-Spey design as an {{alternative}} to the BS100. This alternative engine arrangement was widely seen as inferior, particularly due to the danger posed by asymmetric thrust output if a single engine failure occurred; however, Rolls-Royce claimed that their solution could be available sooner than the BS100 would be. In December 1962, Bristol performed the first successful run of a PCB-equipped Pegasus 2 engine. In order to perform a vertical takeoff, the use of PCB was necessitated; however, this feature would have come at the cost of significant ground erosion during operations.|$|E
5|$|Although the F-35B {{is fully}} capable of {{performing}} vertical landing, {{in a similar}} fashion to the way that the Harrier and Sea Harrier operated, this method of operation places limitations on the loads that the aircraft is capable of returning to the ship with. As a consequence, to avoid the costly disposal at sea of both fuel and munitions, the Royal Navy is developing the Shipborne rolling vertical landing (SRVL) technique for its operation of the Lightning II. SRVL is a hybrid landing technique that uses the Lightning's <b>vectored</b> <b>thrust</b> capability to slow its forward speed to around 70 knots to allow it to make a rolling landing, using its disc brakes, without the need of an arrestor wire. A special type of metallic 'thermal paint' is being developed to withstand temperatures of up to 1,500C in the vicinity of jet nozzles.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the engine}} being mounted above the center of gravity, power was highly {{stabilizing}} (addition of power would push the nose down), {{which could have been}} disconcerting to pilots. Initially, Piper designers incorporated an automatic pitch trim system to coordinate horizontal stabilizer angle of incidence with power setting. This system was later replaced by a <b>vectored</b> <b>thrust</b> nozzle, developed by Williams International, which resulted in reduced weight and simplified manufacturing processes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an approach based on using both bias momentum and multiple control moment gyros for controlling {{the attitude of}} statically unstable thrustlevitated vehicles in hover or slow translation. The stabilization approach described in this paper uses these internal angular momentum transfer devices for stability, augmented by <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> for trim and other “outer loop ” control functions, including CMG stabilization/desaturation under persistent externanl disturbances. Simulation results show the feasibility of (1) improved vehicle performance beyond bias momentum assisted <b>vector</b> <b>thrusting</b> control, and (2) using control moment gyros to significantly reduce the external torque required from the <b>vector</b> <b>thrusting</b> machinery. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{suggested}} minimum noise take-off {{technique for}} the HS.141 {{was to use}} full power from the lift engines in a vertical climb to 250ft(76m) then reducing power to 83% to continue this climb to 1,000ft (300m). At this height the aircraft would transition into forward flight using <b>vectored</b> <b>thrust</b> from the lift engines and then accelerate and climb to 2,000ft (600m) using increasing thrust from the cruise engines. By this stage the aircraft would have reached an airspeed of 168knots (310km/h) and would be fully supported by its wings alone, the lift engines being shut down and covered by hinged doors.|$|E
25|$|The {{specification}} produced {{responses from}} nine manufacturers, including Convair, who submitted its Model 48 Charger in March 1964. The Model 48 was a twin-boom monoplane, constructed mainly from aluminium, with fiberglass nose, rear fuselage and wingtips, with a retractable nosewheel undercarriage. It was powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT-6 (military designation T-74), driving three bladed propellers. Its wings were of relatively short (27ft 6in/8.38m) span, {{which meant that}} most of the wing was in the slipstream of the propellers, increasing the effectiveness of the full-span trailing-edge slotted flaps and leading edge slats inboard of the engines, which together acted to deflect the slipstream, giving a form of <b>vectored</b> <b>thrust,</b> in order to reduce takeoff and landing distances. The outer trailing-edge flaps doubled as ailerons, which were supplemented by spoilers at low speed. The aircraft was fitted with a large, all-moving tailplane which attached to the vertical fins located at the ends of the tailboom(s), with the tailplane having somewhat greater span (20ft (6.1m)) than the distance between the tailbooms.|$|E
500|$|Rotating the <b>vectored</b> <b>thrust</b> nozzles into a {{forward-facing}} position during {{normal flight}} is called vectoring in forward flight, or [...] "VIFFing". This is a dog-fighting tactic, allowing for more sudden braking and higher turn rates. Braking {{could cause a}} chasing aircraft to overshoot and present itself as a target for the Harrier it was chasing, a combat technique formally developed by the USMC for the Harrier in the early 1970s.|$|E

40|$|Using <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring,</b> {{the problem}} of {{pitching}} up a high alpha fighter aircraft to 90 degrees angle of attack in minimum time is considered. Pontryagin's maximum principle is used together with a two-point boundary value numerical algorithm to derive open-loop controls for various parameterized limits on <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> angles. Without <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring,</b> a high alpha fighter with initial conditions 0. 6 Mach number and 15, 000 feet requires 7. 0 seconds to pitch-up to 90 degrees. However, with 20 -degree angle <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring,</b> the pitch-up takes only 1. 5 seconds with a final Mach number of 0. 47. Also, the gain in altitude is less than 100 feet. More important, additional <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> yields litle benefit beyond the 20 -degree angles. This paper describes control solutions in detail for <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> angles between 0 and 90 degrees...|$|R

500|$|In retrospect, {{aviation}} author Tony Buttler {{considered the}} cancellation of the aircraft to be justified, noting the time consuming and expensive failures of attempts by other nations (such as Soviet/Russia's Yak-41 and West Germany's EWR VJ 101) at a supersonic VTOL aircraft. These aircraft all used a multiple engines configuration like the Mirage IIIV, and not the single <b>vectored</b> <b>thrust</b> turbofan of the likes of the BS.100 and Pegasus which went on to great success in the Harrier. Wood described the overall situation as: [...] "From start to finish the P.1154 programme was a story of delay, ministerial interference and indecision... the P.1150 would now be the ideal aircraft for the new generation through-deck cruisers" ...|$|E
500|$|Design {{work on the}} P.1127 was {{formally}} started in 1957 by Sir Sydney Camm, Ralph Hooper of Hawker Aircraft, and Stanley Hooker (later Sir Stanley Hooker) of the Bristol Engine Company. The close cooperation between Hawker, the airframe company, and Bristol, the engine company, was viewed by project engineer Gordon Lewis {{as one of the}} key factors that allowed the development of the Harrier to continue in spite of technical obstacles and political setbacks. Rather than using rotors or a direct jet thrust, the P.1127 had an innovative <b>vectored</b> <b>thrust</b> turbofan engine, the Pegasus. The Pegasus I was rated at [...] of thrust and first ran in September 1959. A contract for two development prototypes was signed in June 1960 and the first flight followed in October 1960. Of the six prototypes built three crashed—including one during an air display at the 1963 Paris Air Show.|$|E

40|$|Two-dimensional wedge nozzle {{performance}} characteristics were investigated {{in a series}} of wind-tunnel tests.

An integrated twin-engine/nozzle model, tested with and without empenage surfaces, included cruise, acceleration, <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> and <b>thrust</b> reversing nozzle operating modes. Results indicate that the thrust-minus-aftbody drag performance of the twin two-dimensional nozzle integration is significantly higher, for speeds greater than Mach 0. 8, than the performance achieved with twin axisymmetric nozzle installations.

Further verification of the calculation is made by comparing the numerical results with transonic data for a wing-body combination.

Blended Wing Body configuration is a novel aircraft concept. Due to the absence of conventional tails longitudinal controllability become part of the key challenges of this configuration. It is therefore the objective of this thesis project to carry out quantified flight mechanics analyses on the effectiveness of controlling a Blended Wing Body aircraft with <b>vectoring</b> <b>thrust.</b> As a starting point flight mechanics simulations under steady level flight conditions in longitudinal plane are conducted in this project. Through this project a <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> model, which contains the calculation of nozzle deflection angles based on nozzle deflection controls and the calculation of engine thrust loss due to nozzle deflections, is developed and embedded in a flight mechanics toolbox used for the flight mechanics simulations. The flight mechanics simulations of <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> control are then carried out with a series of nozzle deflections, flight conditions, aircraft mass and CG locations. From the simulation results it is investigated that for the Blended Wing Body configuration tested in this project, <b>thrust</b> <b>vectoring</b> control under steady level flight conditions is much less effective than the conventional aerodynamic control surfaces.
