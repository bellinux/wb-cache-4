40|$|ABSTRACT The insect-trapping {{movement}} of the plant Dionaea muscipula (<b>Venus's</b> <b>fly-trap)</b> is mediated by the stimulation of mechanosensory hairs located {{on the surface of}} the trap. It is known that stimulation of the hairs is followed by action potentials which are propagated over the surface of the trap. It has been reported that action potentials always precede trap closure, The occurrence of non-propagated receptor potentials is reported here. Receptor potentials always precede the action potentials. The receptor potential appears to couple the mechanical stimulation step to the action potential step of the preying sequence. Receptor potentials elicited by mechanical stimulation of a sensory hair were measured by using the hair as an integral part of the currentmeasuring path. The tip of the hair was cut off exposing the medullary tissue; this provided a natural extension of the measuring electrode into the receptor region at the base of the hair. A measuring pipette electrode was slipped over the cut tip of the hair. Positive and negative receptor potentials were measured. Evidence is presented which supports the hypothesis that the positive an...|$|R

40|$|Transmembrane {{transport}} of a hydrophilic solute {{is presumed to}} begin when hydrated ligand adheres in Velcro-like fashion to hydrated membrane surface. Asymmetric physical forces cause rolling movements of ligand over membrane surface until contact occurs with appropriate transport machinery, consisting of a pump (Pu) to which is tethered a ligand (Li) -specific perm-selective pore (Po). The Po is in the open form when the Li is attached to an external high-affinity allosteric site on it. The active form of the Pu is stabilized by attachment of the Li to high-affinity internal or low-affinity external allosteric sites. The active form of the Pu induces closure of the Po, even when ligand is bound to it; the inactive conformation of the Pu permits Po opening. Attachment of Li to either one of two binding sites on the active Pu and irreversible envelopment by it in <b>Venus</b> <b>fly-trap</b> fashion trigger transmembrane {{transport of}} Li. Multistep attachment of Li is rate-limiting in the transport process. Application of a simple equation derived from relevant kinetic considerations relating velocity of transport (V) to concentration of Li (L), V = k 1 (L) 1 / 2, gives V-L curves approximating transport data obtained {{in a variety of}} biological systems. This model is congruent with the ability of cells to concentrate substances from extremely dilute solutions and with the adaptive informational value to cells of rates of transport...|$|E

60|$|In {{the first}} place, such {{adjustments}} as those exemplified above are made comprehensible. Though it is inconceivable that a structure {{like that of}} the pitcher-plant could have been produced by accumulated effects of function on structure; yet it is conceivable that successive selections of favourable variations might have produced it; and the like holds of the no less remarkable appliance of the <b>Venus's</b> <b>Fly-trap,</b> or the still more astonishing one of that water-plant by which infant-fish are captured. Though it is impossible to imagine how, by direct influence of increased use, such dermal appendages as a porcupine's quills could have been developed; yet, profiting as the members of a species otherwise defenceless might do by the stiffness of their hairs, rendering them unpleasant morsels to eat, it is a feasible supposition that from successive survivals of individuals thus defended in the greatest degrees, and the consequent growth in successive generations of hairs into bristles, bristles into spines, spines into quills (for all these are homologous), this change could have arisen. In like manner, the odd inflatable bag of the bladder-nosed seal, the curious fishing-rod with its worm-like appendage carried on the head of the lophius or angler, the spurs on the wings of certain birds, the weapons of the sword-fish and saw-fish, the wattles of fowls, and numberless such peculiar structures, though by no possibility explicable as due to effects of use or disuse, are explicable as resulting from natural selection operating in one or other way.|$|R

Shiel, who was a vigorous racist, sometimes exhibiting a hatred and horror of Jews and Far Eastern races. Rohmer's own racism was careless and casual, a mere symptom of the times. But he recognized other people's fears and loathings, and tapped directly into them with his saga of the fiendish, and seemingly deathless, Dr. Fu Manchu, whose millions of minions were ever biding their time, awaiting the order to inundate and subjugate the Western white races, and particularly the British Isles. Even more particularly, London, for {{at the heart of}} the Empire the teeming hordes of [...] "heathen Chinese" [...] swarmed like hyperactive rats around Limehouse Reach and Wapping Old Stairs, poised to flood the capital, turn its citizens into opium or cocaine addicts, and carry off the flower of British maidenhood to the stews of Shanghai.This nonsense was believed more or less seriously by just about all classes, even though, as the sociologist Virginia Berridge has determined, the ethnic Chinese population of the Limehouse area - indeed, the whole of London's East End - in the period 1900 through to the Second World War ran to a few hundred at most, the majority of whom were engaged in respectable professions such as cooking and laundering (clothes, not money). As for narcotics, this was, notably, the province of [...] "black" [...] immigrants rather than [...] "yellow" [...] (the well-heeded Chinese restaurant-owner Brilliant Chang notwithstanding) most of the actual drugs were coming from Germany, where cocaine production was virtually unregulated. And, so far as white slavery went, it was to Buenos Aires that most of the young girls travelled (dancers, usually lured by spurious advertisements in The Stage).Nevertheless, with Fu Manchu and his strange cohorts and even more bizarre [...] "pets" [...] (monstrous spiders, lizards, hamadryads, batrachians unknown to science, murderous lepidopterae, <b>Venus</b> <b>fly-traps</b> capable of digesting a man) Rohmer accomplished what all writers of popular fiction yearn for, but rarely achieve - the creation of a character who transcends mere popularity and becomes an entry in the dictionary.|$|R
40|$|The {{arginine}} binding protein from Thermatoga maritima (TmArgBP), a substrate binding protein (SBP) {{involved in}} the ABC system of solute transport, presents a number of remarkable properties. These include an extraordinary stability to temperature and chemical denaturants and the tendency to form multimeric structures, an uncommon feature among SBPs involved in solute transport. Here we report a biophysical and structural characterization of the TmArgBP dimer. Our data indicate that the dimer of the protein is endowed with a remarkable stability since its full dissociation requires high temperature as well as SDS and urea at high concentrations. In order to elucidate the atomic level structural properties of this intriguing protein, we determined the crystallographic structures of the apo and the arginine-bound forms of TmArgBP using MAD and SAD methods, respectively. The comparison of the liganded and unliganded models demonstrates that TmArgBP tertiary structure undergoes a very large structural re-organization upon arginine binding. This transition follows the <b>Venus</b> <b>Fly-trap</b> mechanism, although the entity of the re-organization observed in TmArgBP is larger than that observed in homologous proteins. Intriguingly, TmArgBP dimerizes through the swapping of the C-terminal helix. This dimer is stabilized exclusively by the interactions established by the swapping helix. Therefore, the TmArgBP dimer combines {{a high level of}} stability and conformational freedom. The structure of the TmArgBP dimer represents an uncommon example of large tertiary structure variations amplified at quaternary structure level by domain swapping. Although the biologica...|$|E
