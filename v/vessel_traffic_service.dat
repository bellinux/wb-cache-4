5|$|The Bintulu Port Authority was {{established}} in 1981. It started port operation in 1983 at Tanjung Kidurong. Following a privatisation exercise, Bintulu Port Sdn Bhd (BPSB) was founded on 23 December 1992 and commenced operation on 1 January 1993. BPA is currently responsible for regulatory exercises and security of the port. Meanwhile, BPSB is responsible for cargo handling at the Bintulu International Container Terminal (BICT). The port also provides <b>Vessel</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>service</b> to shipping vessels. The annual total cargo throughput is 45.4 million tonnes, consisting of 58% LNG and 42% non-LNG products. As of 31 December 2014, it generated a total revenue of RM552.3 million per year. Bintulu Port is the busiest port in Sarawak.|$|E
25|$|Fedje <b>Vessel</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Service</b> Centre was {{established}} on 1 September 1992. As both a <b>vessel</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>service</b> and a pilot station, it controls and serves shipping traffic into two major oil terminals, Mongstad and Sture.|$|E
25|$|Proposals for a VTS serving Boknafjorden and Rogaland were {{launched}} {{in the wake of}} the 1992 opening of Fedje <b>Vessel</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Service</b> Centre. Kvitsøy was early on mentioned as a potential site, although sites in Stavanger/Sandnes were also considered. Funding for preliminary work was granted by the government in 1997. Horten <b>Vessel</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Service</b> Centre, which serves the Oslofjord, was prioritized ahead of Kvitsøy and opened in 1999. The Coastal Administration announced in 2002 that they would centralized pilot dispatching and that Kvitsøy VTS would take over all such activities in Western Norway and Central Norway, including the dispatching taking place at Fedje VTS.|$|E

25|$|The {{primary use}} of the {{heliport}} is {{in conjunction with the}} pilot station at Fedje <b>Vessel</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Service</b> Centre. Transport of pilots to ships is offered to ships which exceed 30,000 gross tonnes with dangerous or polluting cargo and headed for the terminals at Mongstad or Sture. These flights are provided by Lufttransport using an AgustaWestland AW109 based at Bergen Airport, Flesland.|$|E
25|$|Large vessel {{operators}} {{should note}} that traffic on the approach to the Juan de Fuca Strait is handled by MCTS Tofino, within the Juan de Fuca Strait by Puget Sound Seattle <b>Vessel</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Service,</b> and north of Race Rocks, the Marine Communications and Traffic Services centre for the approach to Victoria Harbour is the MCTS Victoria station in Patricia Bay.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} a <b>vessel</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>service</b> arose with the {{construction}} of the bases and refineries at Mongstad and Sture. This created a situation with 2,500 annual shiploads of oil combining with 20,000 annual ships in other traffic. The national authorities approved the center in 1990, allowing construction to start in June 1991. This included construction of three radars, one on Fedje, one at Vikingneset on the Gulen island of Byrknesøyna, and one on Marøy. Fedje VTS cost 31million Norwegian krone and was funded entirely by the operators of the bases, Statoil and Norsk Hydro.|$|E
40|$|Shore-based systems {{monitoring}} and interacting with maritime traffic {{have been established}} around the coast lines of the world since the mid- 20 th century. To provide harmonisation of these systems the International Maritime Organization and the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities have issued recommendations and guidelines for the establishment and operation {{of what is now}} called <b>Vessel</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Services.</b> Despite these efforts, studies have highlighted issues with the ability to form expectations about <b>Vessel</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Services.</b> In order to research what lies beneath the surface of these issues and how they can be overcome, three group interviews with a total of 24 Australian <b>Vessel</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Services</b> operators were conducted, using the concept of common ground as a framework guiding the study. Results suggest that existing bases for common ground, such as international recommendations and guidelines and local rules and procedures, are not always relied upon. Instead expectations are based on participants’ nationality, language, professional background, and direct personal experiences. Results also indicate that <b>Vessel</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Services</b> often focus on activities related to port operations rather than <b>vessel</b> <b>traffic,</b> and that interpretations of the current traffic situation are not always based on the same information across participants in the Maritime Traffic System. To overcome these issues it is suggested that the establishment of reliable shared bases among participants in the Maritime Traffic System should be facilitated...|$|R

25|$|Originally Fedje was {{responsible}} for its own pilot dispatching. In 2002 the Coastal Administration carried out a centralization of the dispatching and relocating it to the newly established Kvitsøy <b>Vessel</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Service</b> Centre. However, Fedje VTS retained an around-the-clock two-man staff. A major accident took place within {{the jurisdiction of the}} center on 12 January 2007, when the Cypriot cargo vessel MV Server went aground {{on the south side of}} Fedje. Fedje received 40million kroner in 2009 to upgrade its computer and radar equipment. Unlike other investments and operating costs, these were paid for directly by the state instead of through shipping fees.|$|E
25|$|Starting in January 1996, the {{helicopter}} service was made permanent {{and offered to}} any ship heading to Mongstad or Sture which exceeded a gross tonnage of 20,000. Costs for {{the helicopter}} were originally {{not included in the}} pilot's fee and were paid directly from the shipping company to Helikopter Service. A three-year contract for helicopter services for the pilots was issued in 1997. Three companies bid and Helikopter Service won. The helicopters would often fly low over the settlement, around the clock, causing complaints from local residents. From 2002 the contract was won by Lufttransport. This time the contract was extended and also included the responsibility for flying pilots out of Kvitsøy <b>Vessel</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Service</b> Centre.|$|E
25|$|At 8:55a.m., Sewols crew {{made their}} first {{distress}} {{call to the}} Jeju <b>vessel</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>service</b> and asked the Jeju VTS to notify the Coast Guard, as the ferry was rolling and in danger. At 8:56a.m., the Jeju VTS called the Jeju Coast Guard. Three minutes later, the Jeju Coast Guard called the Mokpo Coast Guard and discovered that a patrol boat had already been dispatched. At 9:01a.m., a crew member on Sewol called the Incheon branch of Chonghaejin Marine to report the situation, and the Chonghaejin Marine headquarters located in Jeju then called Captain Lee at 9:03a.m. for {{a report of the}} situation. The Incheon branch then talked with the first mate in five telephone calls over the next 35 minutes.|$|E
50|$|At the {{entrance}} of the port is a large tower for the officers of the <b>Vessel</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Services</b> (VTS). The tower provides the staff with a good view over the harbour entrance and the entire port area. The VTS is fitted with radar on top of the tower.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Vessel</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>services</b> (VTS) go {{even farther}} as safety systems, being {{analogous}} to the proactive function of air traffic control systems. VTS assist <b>vessel</b> <b>traffic</b> control in routing vessels in busy waters. Other vessel-based safety collision avoidance functions are [...] Automatic Radar Plotting Aids (ARPA), usually {{a component of the}} radar system or an accessory to it, and coupled with the radar system input to the chartplotter.|$|R
50|$|The {{automatic}} identification system (AIS) is an automatic tracking system used for collision avoidance on ships and by <b>vessel</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>services</b> (VTS). When satellites are used to detect AIS signatures, the term Satellite-AIS (S-AIS) is used. AIS information supplements marine radar, which {{continues to be the}} primary method of collision avoidance for water transport.|$|R
25|$|The primary {{operational}} goal {{of satellite}} AIS is {{the gathering of}} positioning and course information from fisheries and ship traffic within the Norwegian EEZ {{with the intent of}} environmental surveillance. The vessel data is used by the Coastal Administration and in particular Vardø <b>Vessel</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Service</b> Centre to monitor ship traffic. The data is stored and {{can also be used to}} collect accurate statistics on ship traffic in the Arctic. Unlike terrestrial data collection, the satellite information is not made publicly available. A contributing cause is that certain fishers many not want to reveal their fishing positions and could then have chosen to turn off their AIS instead. Data can also be used to identify any ship causing an oil spill. There are more than one thousand annual oil spills and illegal dumping in Norwegian waters. While observation satellites have previously been able to identify spills, the satellite AIS monitoring can normally identify the culprit and the data used as evidence.|$|E

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{sophistication of}} petroleum derivatives and dangerous and noxious chemicals {{carried by sea}} {{has resulted in a}} corresponding increase in the precautions taken by coastal states. High in importance amongst these precautions has been the introduction of <b>Vessel</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Services,</b> constituting shore-based organizations fulfilling a variety of functions, often based on advanced radar techniques. The kernel of any such system is communication, chiefly between shore and ship, ship and shore, but including communication ship to ship. Without such communications information cannot be passed, and advice and instructions cannot be given. This thesis describes the theoretical and practical linguistic research and application that has taken place in the field of <b>Vessel</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Services.</b> It offers solutions to existing and predicted communication events, chiefly by voice, but including concepts embodying VDU techniques. Further, it describes practical trials that have been carried out, and procedures which have been instituted {{as a result of the}} overall research detailed herein...|$|R
2500|$|Marine radars {{are used}} to measure the bearing and {{distance}} of ships to prevent collision with other ships, to navigate, and to fix their position at sea when within range of shore or other fixed references such as islands, buoys, and lightships.
