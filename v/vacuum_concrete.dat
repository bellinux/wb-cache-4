50|$|The final {{strength}} of concrete is increased by about 25%. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>concrete</b> stiffens very rapidly {{so that the}} formworks can be removed within 30 minutes of casting even on columns of 20 ft. high.This is of considerable economic value, particularly in a precast factory as the forms can be reused at frequent intervals. The bond {{strength of}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>concrete</b> is about 20% higher. The surface of <b>vacuum</b> <b>concrete</b> is entirely free from pitting and the uppermost 1/16 inch is highly resistant to abrasion. These characteristics are of special importance {{in the construction of}} concrete structures which are to be in contact with flowing water at a high velocity.It bonds well to old concrete and can, therefore, be used for resurfacing road slabs and other repair work.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>{{concrete}},</b> made {{by using}} steam {{to produce a}} vacuum inside a concrete mixing truck to release air bubbles inside the concrete, is being researched. The {{idea is that the}} steam displaces the air normally over the concrete. When the steam condenses into water it will create a low pressure over the concrete that will pull air from the concrete. This will make the concrete stronger due to there being less air in the mixture. A drawback is that the mixing has to be done in an airtight container.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of vacuum mixing of UHPC on the compressive and tensile strength, and Young's modulus is examined. These mechanical properties {{are influenced by}} the microstructure and the pore system. Classical models predicting these properties based on the water-to-cement ratio do not consider the effect of vacuum mixing, which is quite new. This will be even more important in the case of UHPC because of the extremely low water-to-cement ratio and the larger {{influence of}} changes in air content. In this research, two different mixer sizes are considered : a vacum paste mixer (capacity of 5 liter) and a <b>vacuum</b> <b>concrete</b> mixer (capacity of 75 liter). For each mixer, three different pressure levels are examined : vacuum (100 mbar), semi-vacuum (500 mbar) and atmospheric pressure (1013 mbar). The influence of heat treatment (90 °C) in CoMParison or combination with vacuum mixing is evaluated by means of the compressive strength on concrete cubes 100 mm...|$|E

40|$|Very fine plastic {{shrinkage}} crack is often reported to occur on <b>vacuum</b> processed <b>concrete</b> slab, {{which is considered}} due to cement-richness of a surface layer. A shrinkage-reduction admixture is used in order to prevent such plastic {{shrinkage crack}}s. Although the cracks can be avoided by this method, white powders of CaCO 3 sometimes appear on the surface. The effects of the admixture and curing condition were investigated on the amount of powders and the bond strength. It was found that appropriate addition of the admixture successfully reduces the plastic shrinkage cracks without producing powders on the surface...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{scientific}} work {{is dedicated to}} development of scientific-technical bases of production and application of concrete {{on the basis of}} ashes of thermal power plants (TPP). Methodology. The properties of TPP ash, as well as the peculiarities of its behavior in a concrete mix as a fine aggregate, have been studied. It is shown that the hydrolysis and hydration of cement occur in the active environment of ash, which has a huge specific surface area. This significantly affects the course of these processes {{and the quality of the}} concrete produced. A new technology of application of ash of TPP for preparation of concrete mixes is offered. Vibrated and vibrovacuumized concretes of optimum composition from slag and ash, as well as from granite crushed stone and ash, are tested. The chara-cteristics of ordinary concrete (from granite crushed stone and quartz sand) are given to compare. Findings. The results of the tests showed the possibility of obtaining concretes of class C 20 / 25 …C 25 / 30 on the basis of slag and ash of TPP at a limited consumption of cement. It is shown that the concrete with traditional aggregates has a lower strength than the concrete, which has ash as fine aggregate. This research results contribute to the increased use of ash in construction that solves the problem of aggregates as well as thermal power plants waste recycling. Originality. New method and technology of application of TPP ashes in concrete are developed. Ash concrete mix has rational flowability, which produces the greatest strength of ash <b>vacuum</b> <b>concrete.</b> This strength is twice or more as large as the strength of vibrated ash concrete mix with flowability S 1. Practical value. The physico-chemical properties of TPP ash as aggregate for concrete are presented. Significant difference of ash from ordinary aggregates is shown. Chemical activity of the ash is justified. The special conditions of cement hardening in the case of using ash as aggregate for concrete are presented. The advantages of ash over traditional aggregate are shown. The research results contribute to the mass application of TPP ash in construction and obtaining the products from the proposed concrete of low cost with high physical-mechanical properties. Ash as an aggregate has a particularly high efficiency in vibrovacuumized concrete...|$|E

A three times increase in the cold atoms population is obtained with contact-less pulsed light-induced desorption, applied to different isotopes, either bosonic or fermionic, of Francium. A six times increase of 210 Fr population is obtained with a desorption mechanism based on direct charge transfer from a triboelectric probe to the adatom-organic coating complex. Our findings provide new insight on the microscopic mechanisms of atomic desorption from organic coatings.

40|$|The Paper {{undertakes}} {{a detailed}} {{survey of the}} various policy instruments and institutions, which two seemingly similar economies have implemented to increase R&D investments by their respective private sector enterprises. The two economies are Singapore and Malaysia, which have both shown rather good economic results and have already become developed countries or is in the definite path towards becoming one in the foreseeable future. A careful examination of their innovation policies shows some contrasting experiences. Singapore has assiduously built up {{a critical mass of}} technically trained human resource and then provided a variety of fiscal incentives. The result has been significant rises in the research intensity of its enterprise sector. It has also put into effect some imaginative policies for engineering positive spillovers from MNCs to local industry. Malaysia, on the contrary, has very similar fiscal instruments for encouraging innovation. But it suffers from a chronic shortage of technically trained human resource of the type that is required for its increasingly sophisticated enterprise sector. Despite explicit recognition of this crucial policy <b>vacuum,</b> nothing <b>concrete</b> seems to be happening in this direction. Research and Development, Government Policy, Southeast Asia...|$|R
5000|$|Concrete {{is usually}} ground dry for convenience, {{because it can}} be done with fewer people than wet grinding, {{although}} a HEPA filter-equipped vacuum is needed to capture the fine dust produced. Of course concrete can also be ground wet in which case no <b>vacuum</b> is used.Fine <b>concrete</b> dust contains silica which is very harmful to the lungs and can lead to silicosis so all effort should be made to avoid breathing concrete dust. For green building methods many regulators LEED's have seen the benefit of using concrete grinders that are designed to finish concrete to a very stable wear surface, that can safely be used for many years as a floor or tabletop surface [...] These machines are usually powered by higher electrical power such as 220 volts or higher as they require motor power larger than 110 volts can supply. Some machine are powered by LP gas such as used on forklifts {{so that they can be}} run in well ventilated areas without a power cord, but these machines usually have fewer features that a fully electric unit. Variable speed is one good feature only available on all electric versions, that allows for slowing down of the grinding speed to keep the tooling in contact with the floor.|$|R
40|$|Phase change {{materials}} (PCMs) are {{an effective}} way of storing/releasing thermal energy via phase transformations. Incorporating PCMs into concrete pavements at airports has been suggested {{as a means to}} reduce the accumulation of snow and ice on runways. This thesis reports on the development of two phase change materials composed of binary mixtures of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) which provide a solid-liquid transition slightly above 0 °C with a high enthalpy of fusion. Current findings {{of this study indicate that}} these mixtures have the necessary properties to be a high performance PCM with the potential to reduce the levels of icing on concrete pavements. Additionally, possible methods to incorporate this PCM into concrete were examined specifically ambient and <b>vacuum</b> absorption into <b>concrete</b> aggregate and encapsulation in a SiO 2 shell. ^ Mixtures plant triacylglycerols and mixtures of saturated and unsaturated FAMEs of different carbon chain lengths (C 8 -C 18) were investigated for targeted thermal properties, including a phase transition temperature slightly above 0 °C, high latent enthalpy of fusion, high heat capacity and high thermal conductivity. Two binary mixtures were identified with suitable thermal properties to be used as a PCM: (1) methyl laurate + methyl myristate, xlaurate = 0. 77 ± 0. 01, and (2) methyl laurate + methyl palmitate, x laurate= 0. 86 ± 0. 01. Using differential scanning calorimetry, Tammann plots and phase diagrams were created; indicating that the phase behavior of these binary mixtures at their eutectic compositions demonstrated useful properties as PCMs. Overall, the maximal amount of methyl esters that can be absorbed into lightweight aggregate was achieved through vacuum absorption at room temperature (approximately 24 % m/m). However, this may not be practical in industrial scales, hence an alternative method, such as embedding a tube filled with a methyl ester mixture into the concrete system, should be investigated...|$|R
