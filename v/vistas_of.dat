5|$|Altan Khan {{eventually}} {{made peace with}} China when it opened border cities for trade in 1571, alleviating the Mongol need to raid. This, coupled with Qi and Tan's efforts to secure the frontier, brought a period of relative peace along the border. However, minor raids still happened {{from time to time}} when the profits of plunder outweighed those of trade, prompting the Ming to close all gaps along the frontier around Beijing. Areas of difficult terrain once considered impassable were also walled off, leading to the well-known <b>vistas</b> <b>of</b> a stone-faced Great Wall snaking over dramatic landscapes that tourists still see today.|$|E
5|$|Smuts {{thrived in}} this environment. With these new <b>vistas</b> <b>of</b> {{knowledge}} and learning now {{revealed that he}} spared no effort in his attempts to master them. His surviving notebooks from this period reveal the range and breadth of his studies: Latin, Greek, German, the Classics, Optical Physics, Inorganic Chemistry and Metallurgy, Organic Chemistry and Agriculture, and Geology - to name but a few. Once again, as had been the case at Riebeek West, this was not merely study {{for the sake of}} exams - as ever, Smuts continued to study avidly outside the confines of the curriculum.|$|E
5|$|When the United States {{took over}} the Philippine Islands from the Spanish in 1898 after the Spanish–American War, President William McKinley began Americanizing the former Spanish colony. In 1900 he {{appointed}} William Howard Taft to head the Philippine Commission to evaluate {{the needs of the}} new territory. Taft, who later became the Philippines' first civilian Governor-General, decided that Manila, the capital, should be a planned town. He hired as his architect and city planner Daniel Hudson Burnham, who had built Union Station and the Postal Square Building in Washington. In Manila, Burnham had in mind a long wide, tree-lined boulevard along the bay, beginning at a park area dominated by a magnificent hotel. To execute Burnham's plans, Taft hired William E. Parsons, a New York City architect, who envisioned an impressive, comfortable hotel along the lines of a California mission but grander. The original design was an H-shaped plan that focused on well-ventilated rooms on two wings, providing grand <b>vistas</b> <b>of</b> the harbor, the Luneta, and Intramuros. The top floor was, in fact, a large viewing deck that was used for various functions, including watching the American navy steam into the harbor.|$|E

25|$|In 1955 the Rotary Club of Wollongong, {{with the}} active support of local {{government}} and businesses, constructed the summit lookout. In 2005, the Summit Park refurbishment provided an opening up of magnificent <b>vistas</b> <b>of</b> the coastal plain from Kiama to Sydney, and is managed as an annexe of the Wollongong Botanic Garden. It contains 9.4 hectares of land {{and it is a}} major tourist destination, many visitors to Wollongong climbing the Ken Ausburn Track.|$|E
25|$|Franklin D. Roosevelt, who {{had long}} envisioned a scenic road through the eastern Hudson Valley, was {{instrumental}} in making it a reality {{as a way to}} provide access to existing and planned state parks in the region. Its winding, hilly route was designed by landscape architect Gilmore Clarke to offer scenic <b>vistas</b> <b>of</b> the Hudson Highlands, Catskills and Taconic regions. The bridges and now-closed service areas were designed to be aesthetically pleasing. It has been praised for the beauty of not only the surrounding landscape and views it offers, but the way the road itself integrates with and presents them.|$|E

25|$|Willy DeVille's Backstreets of Desire stands tall as his {{masterpiece}} as both {{a singer}} and a songwriter. DeVille's considerable reputation in Paris buoyed him up to make this disc... With guest spots by Dr. John, Zachary Richard, and David Hidalgo, DeVille creates a tapestry of roots rock and Crescent City second line, traces of 1950s doo-wop, and elegant sweeping <b>vistas</b> <b>of</b> Spanish soul balladry, combined with lyrics full of busted-down heroes, hungry lovers, and wise men trying {{to get off the}} street. The sound of the album balances Creole soul and pure rock pyrotechnics. DeVille sounds like a man resurrected, digging as deep as the cavernous recesses of the human heart.|$|E
25|$|The three {{kilometre}} (1.9 mile) round-trip, {{hiking trail}} on Partridge Island climbs quickly to {{a height of}} about 61 metres (200 feet) above sea level, but there are four benches to rest on. There is a lookoff {{at the top of}} the trail from which a viewing platform offers <b>vistas</b> <b>of</b> more than 60 kilometres (37 miles) of the coastline of the Upper Minas Basin. Prominent features include Cape Blomidon, Cape Split, Cape Sharp, Cape d'Or, and Cobequid Bay. At dusk many lighthouses can be seen on the coasts surrounding Partridge Island. Visitors are advised to stay on the trail and to keep away from the edge of the cliffs, which could give way without warning.|$|E
25|$|As part of Star Warss 20th {{anniversary celebration}} in 1997, The Empire Strikes Back was {{digitally}} remastered and re-released along with Star Wars and Return of the Jedi {{under the title}} Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition. Lucas took this opportunity to make several {{minor changes to the}} film. These included explicitly showing the Wampa creature on Hoth in full form, creating a more complex flight path for the Falcon as it approaches Cloud City, digitally replacing some of the interior walls of Cloud City with <b>vistas</b> <b>of</b> Bespin, and replacing certain lines of dialogue. A short sequence was also added depicting Vader's return to his Super Star Destroyer after dueling with Luke, created from alternate angles of a scene from Return of the Jedi. Most of the changes were small and aesthetic; however, some fans believe that they detract from the film.|$|E

25|$|Reed's {{breakthrough}} in yellow fever research {{is widely considered}} a milestone in biomedicine, opening new <b>vistas</b> <b>of</b> research and humanitarianism. It was largely an extension of Carlos J. Finlay's work, carried out during the 1870s in Cuba, which finally came to prominence in 1900. Finlay {{was the first to}} theorize, in 1881, that a mosquito was a carrier, now known as a disease vector, of the organism causing yellow fever: a mosquito that bites a victim of the disease could subsequently bite and thereby infect a healthy person. He presented this theory at the 1881 International Sanitary Conference, where it was well received. A year later Finlay identified a mosquito of the genus Aedes as the organism transmitting yellow fever. His theory was followed by the recommendation to control the mosquito population as a way to control the spread of the disease.|$|E

500|$|Jolin {{had planned}} to return to Paris the {{following}} summer, but the outbreak of World War I on 28July 1914, forced him to reconsider his decision. With the road to France closed, he decided to stay in Stockholm, and managed to obtain a studio workshop on Fiskargatan 9, in the so-called [...] "Scandalous House" [...] near Katarina Church {{in the southern part}} of town. From his window he had a wide view of the city, the Stockholms ström and the harbour entrance. In that apartment, during the years 1914–1915, he created some of his best-known <b>vistas</b> <b>of</b> Stockholm.|$|E
500|$|The {{walk up the}} Tor to the {{distinctive}} tower at the summit (the partially restored remains of an old church) is rewarded by <b>vistas</b> <b>of</b> the mid-Somerset area, including the Levels which are drained marshland. From there, on a dry point, [...] above sea level, {{it is easy to}} appreciate how Glastonbury was once an island and, in the winter, the surrounding moors are often flooded, giving that appearance once more. It is an agricultural region typically with open fields of permanent grass, surrounded by ditches with willow trees. Access to the moors and Levels is by [...] "droves", i.e., green lanes. The Levels and inland moors can be [...] below peak tides and have large areas of peat. The low-lying areas are underlain by much older Triassic age formations of Upper Lias sand that protrude to form what would once have been islands and include Glastonbury Tor. The lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000years, following {{the end of the last}} ice age.|$|E

Because of their height, both towers will offer spectacular <b>vistas</b> <b>of</b> the surrounding landscapes. There are 26 different floor plans for the 695 condos which are financially beyond the reach of many citizens residing in San Francisco. The units vary greatly in price from US$500,000 to [...] depending on view and the size of the unit that range from [...] The project opened up a sales office on June 16, 2006 and even before the opening, condo-buyers placed deposits for 130 of the South Tower's 376 condo units in a selling spree.
