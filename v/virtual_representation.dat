40|$|STEM {{instruction}} often uses visual representations. To {{benefit from}} these, {{students need to}} understand how representations show domain-relevant concepts. Yet, this is difficult for students. Prior research shows that physical representations (objects that students manipulate by hand) and <b>virtual</b> <b>representations</b> (objects on a computer screen that students manipulate via mouse and keyboard) have complementary advantages for conceptual learning. However, physical and <b>virtual</b> <b>representations</b> are often embedded into different social classroom contexts, which may affect social mechanisms through which students construct connections between concepts and representations. Therefore, this paper focuses on the social events that precede concept-representation connections. Twelve high-school students worked collaboratively with physical and <b>virtual</b> <b>representations</b> of chemistry. Frequent pattern mining of discourse data was used to identify social events that often preceded concept-representation connections. Qualitative analysis investigated social mechanisms through which these events may enhance concept-representation connections. Results show that students construct concept-representation connections incrementally. Further, meta-cognitive strategies and instructor prompts often preceded concept-representation connections. Finally, differences between physical and <b>virtual</b> <b>representations</b> were mainly due to different social supports being available in {{the context in which the}} representations were embedded.

There is not that intimate and inseparable relation between the electors of Great-Britain, and the inhabitants of the colonies, which must inevitably involve both in the same taxation; on the contrary, not a single actual elector in England might be immediately affected by a taxation in America, imposed by a statute which would have a general operation and effect, upon the properties of the inhabitants of the colonies. The latter might be oppressed in a thousand shapes, without any sympathy, or exciting any alarm in the former. Moreover, even acts, oppressive and injurious to the colonies in an extreme degree, might become popular in England, from the promise or expectation, that the very measures which depressed the colonies, would give ease to the inhabitants of Great-Britain.|$|E

500|$|What's Cooking? is an {{interactive}} cookbook and food preparation video game with recipes that each list preparation times, ingredients and courses. Recipes can be sorted by criteria such as dishes that take less than 20 minutes to prepare, or vegetarian-only meals. After opening a recipe, an ingredient list is presented. Items {{on the list}} can be earmarked and added to a shopping list as a reminder to purchase in the future. A timer option is also available, which counts down from a specified time and makes an audible sound when it is done. Before doing any real cooking, a <b>virtual</b> <b>representation</b> of each step in the recipe is given on the screen that must be performed by the player. The Nintendo DS touchscreen and stylus are used to perform tasks such as whisking eggs, pouring sauces and cutting vegetables. Tutorials are also available to teach the player how to perform simple cooking preparation tasks. While cooking, the Nintendo DS responds to audible commands; saying [...] "next" [...] into the device's microphone will move the recipe {{on to the next}} step. One hundred recipes are included in the game, and players can create their own dishes in the game. Afterward, they can share them with others via Wi-Fi. In addition to the game's cooking aspects, What's Cooking? features challenges in which the player uses the stylus to chop, stir, and serve as quickly as possible.|$|E

Through game theoretic models, Galiani and Torrens show that, once in Parliament, Americans could not feasibly commit to political alliances independent of British democrats. As mounting pressure for democratic reform would pose a threat to the British political order, Galiani and Torrens argue British elites would incur greater losses to their domestic clout from American representation than forfeiting a colony. The implications of forfeiting <b>virtual</b> <b>representation</b> forced the British to decide between maintaining the status quo of American colonialism, which was infeasible, and engaging in war.|$|E

This paper {{concerns}} character sheaves of connected reductive algebraic groups defined over non-Archimedean local {{fields and}} their relation with characters of smooth representations. Although character sheaves were devised with characters of representations of finite groups of Lie type in mind, character sheaves are perfectly well defined for reductive algebraic groups over any algebraically closed field. Nevertheless, {{the relation between}} character sheaves of an algebraic group G over an algebraic closure of a field K and characters of representations of G(K) is well understood only when K is a finite field and when K is the field of complex numbers. In this paper we consider the case when K is a non-Archimedean local field and explain how to match certain character sheaves of a connected reductive algebraic group G with <b>virtual</b> <b>representations</b> of G(K).

Benjamin Franklin had raised this {{as far back as}} 1754 at the Albany Congress when he wrote, [...] "That it is suppos’d an undoubted Right of Englishmen not to be taxed but by their own Consent given thro’ their Representatives. That the Colonies have no Representatives in Parliament." [...] The counter to this argument was the theory of <b>virtual</b> <b>representation.</b> Thomas Whately enunciated this theory in a pamphlet that readily acknowledged that there could be no taxation without consent, but the facts were that at least 75% of British adult males were not represented in Parliament because of property qualifications or other factors. [...] Members of Parliament were bound to represent the interests of all British citizens and subjects, so colonists were the recipients of <b>virtual</b> <b>representation</b> in Parliament, like those disenfranchised subjects in the British Isles. [...] This theory, however, ignored a crucial difference between the unrepresented in Britain and the colonists. [...] The colonists enjoyed actual representation in their own legislative assemblies, and the issue was whether these legislatures, rather than Parliament, were in fact the sole recipients of the colonists' consent with regard to taxation.|$|E
