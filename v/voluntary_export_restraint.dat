50|$|Stewart {{represented}} domestic steel {{producers in}} a series of trade remedy cases that redefined U.S. countervailing duty law practice and that resulted in <b>voluntary</b> <b>export</b> <b>restraint</b> agreements. In 1982, Stewart filed anti-dumping and countervailing duty petitions for a major U.S. producer. These petitions were part {{of a large number of}} trade remedy cases brought by three groups of domestic steel producers at the same time. The petitions resulted in 93 preliminary countervailing duty and antidumping investigations involving 9 steel product lines from 9 countries. The petitions were delivered in 494 boxes, contained an estimated 3 million pages and concerned imported carbon steel products with an estimated value of more than $1 billion. The petitions were later withdrawn in 1982 after the United States and the European Community reached an agreement limiting steel imports for three years. The agreement was later expanded in product coverage and extended through September 1989, and subsequently extended through March 1992.|$|E

40|$|When {{exporting}} firms {{face the}} prospect of voluntary export restraints, they have an incentive to export more than with no prospect of a <b>voluntary</b> <b>export</b> <b>restraint,</b> since greater exports lead to larger license allocations {{in the event of a}} <b>voluntary</b> <b>export</b> <b>restraint.</b> Export-country governments' incentives differ, leading either to export tax or subsidy, depending on the circumstances. The prospect of one departure from free trade, thus, leads to another, a domino effect. Antidumping enforcement will ordinarily not eliminate and ironically may increase dumping.

40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that tariffs are welfare-superior to voluntary export restraints {{in the presence of}} perfect competition. However, with perfectly competitive markets, some authors have found that voluntary export restraints may be welfare superior to tariffs. The authors reconsider the comparison between a <b>voluntary</b> <b>export</b> <b>restraint</b> and a tariff in the context of GATT-based constraints. Using a model of perfect competition, the authors show that a <b>voluntary</b> <b>export</b> <b>restraint</b> can welfare-dominate a tariff increase that is accompanied by a compensatory reduction in the tariff on another good or if the tariff is matched with a retaliatory tariff on domestic exports. ...|$|E

Based on the benchmark model of Obstfeld and Rogoff, this paper aims to examine this belief and evaluate the welfare effects of VERs on the world economy. Analytical results find that VERs exert expansion effects on the exporting economy temporarily. The conventional view of VERs effects holds only when there is perfect competition on the goods market or when the exporting country is bigger than the importing country.

This paper quantifies this effect for the UK restrictions on imports of footwear imposed in the later 1970 's, by isolating changes in the relative prices of exports to the UK and to other markets. Where exporters appear to have little ability to switch supplies between markets the comparisons are made after allowing for movements in real exchange rates. Where, on the other hand, exporters can substitute easily between markets, the comparisons refer to nominal prices. VERs increased UK footwear import prices by 15 %- 25 % for the major restricted suppliers and in 1980 cost the UK economy at least 25 million pounds.

40|$|In May, 1981, a <b>voluntary</b> <b>export</b> <b>restraint</b> (VER) {{was placed}} on exports of {{automobiles}} from Japan to the United States. As trade policies go, this one was important.

40|$|Countries facing <b>voluntary</b> <b>export</b> <b>restraints</b> (VERS) often adopt a two-tier {{allocation}} {{system for}} export licenses to the restricted market: (1) a "basic " allocation related to export shares to the restricted market; and (2) an "open " allocation based on export shares to the nonrestricted market. Such a two-tier allocation system increases {{exports to the}} nonrestricted market beyond the levels which would exist under a single-quota allocation system and has an efficiency cost as it results in some sales being made at less than marginal cost. The history of VER negotiations provides a rationale for such a policy and suggests that the recent increase in antidumping cases may be partly associated with the adoption of two-tier quota allocation systems.
