25|$|Vanillin is a {{phenolic}} aldehyde, {{which is}} an organic compound with the molecular formula C8H8O3. Its functional groups include aldehyde, hydroxyl, and ether. It is the primary component of the extract of the <b>vanilla</b> <b>bean.</b> Synthetic vanillin is now used more often than natural vanilla extract as a flavoring agent in foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major group}} was the Totonacs, who have survived {{to the present}} day. Their region, called Totonacapan, is {{centered}} between the Cazones River and the Papaloapan River {{in the north of}} the state. Pre-Columbian Totonacs lived from hunting, fishing and agriculture, mostly of corn, beans, chili peppers and squash. This is also the native region of the <b>vanilla</b> <b>bean.</b> Clay sculptures with smiling faces are indicative of this culture. The major site is El Tajín, located near Papantla, but the culture reached its apogee in Cempoala (about five miles (8km) inland from the current port of Veracruz), when it was conquered by the Aztecs. When the Spaniards arrived in 1519, the territory was still home to a population of about 250,000 people living in fifty population centers and speaking four Totonac dialects. 25,000 were living in Cempoala alone.|$|E

However, they served the purpose for which he principally undertook them--of giving objects of interest and amusement to his children.|$|E
40|$|Colonizing Bacillus {{in vanilla}} (<b>Vanilla</b> planifolia Andrews) <b>beans</b> is {{involved}} in glucovanillin hydrolysis and vanillin formation during conventional curing. The flavor profiles of <b>vanilla</b> <b>beans</b> under Bacillus-assisted curing were analyzed through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, electronic nose, and quantitative sensory analysis. The flavor profiles were analytically compared among the <b>vanilla</b> <b>beans</b> under Bacillus-assisted curing, conventional curing, and non-microorganism-assisted curing. <b>Vanilla</b> <b>beans</b> added with Bacillus vanillea XY 18 and Bacillus subtilis XY 20 contained higher vanillin (3. 58 % ± 0. 05 % and 3. 48 % ± 0. 10 %, respectively) than <b>vanilla</b> <b>beans</b> that underwent non-microorganism-assisted curing and conventional curing (3. 09 % ± 0. 14 % and 3. 21 % ± 0. 15 %, respectively). Forty-two volatiles were identified from endogenous vanilla metabolism. Five other compounds were identified from exogenous Bacillus metabolism. Electronic nose data confirmed that vanilla flavors produced through the different curing processes were easily distinguished. Quantitative sensory analysis confirmed that Bacillus-assisted curing increased vanillin production without generating any unpleasant sensory attribute. Partial least squares regression further provided a correlation model of different measurements. Overall, we comparatively analyzed the flavor profiles of <b>vanilla</b> <b>beans</b> under Bacillus-assisted curing, indirectly demonstrated the mechanism of vanilla flavor formation by microbes...|$|R

40|$|Vanilla is tropic {{plant that}} has high {{economic}} value. Indonesian vanilla {{is the most}} popular because of vanillin content. Vanillin is the major of flavor compound in vanilla. Vanillin is formed during processing fresh to dry vanilla benas. Decreasing vanillin content and moisture content of dry <b>vanilla</b> <b>beans</b> during storage cause degradation of quality. The objective of this research was determined permeability of plastic packaging, the kinetic of quality degradation of dry <b>vanilla</b> <b>beans</b> were packaged all types of plastic during the storage, and predicted dry vanilla shelf-life. In this research classified for 3 steps, determined water vapour permeability of plastic, the kinetic of quality degradation of dry <b>vanilla</b> <b>beans</b> during the storage, and determined dry vanilla shelf-life. Result value was analyzed descriptively. The result of research showed that permeability of polipropilen 0, 08 mm was 0, 4 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg and permeability of polipropilen 0, 03 mm was 0, 675 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg. But permeability of polietilen 0, 08 mm was 0, 46 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg and permeability of polietilen 0, 03 mm was 0, 795 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg. In the other, permeability of zaack plastic was 8, 14 gH 2 O/harim 2 mmHg. Polipropilen was the most because vanilin content changes was longest time among polietilen and zaack plastic packages, for this reason the stability of <b>vanilla</b> <b>beans</b> quality could be controlled. Polipropilen plastic has Ea = 8 Kal/mol K with A value = 16085, 93; polietilen plastic has Ea = 7, 89 Kal/mol K with A value = 14433, 30; and bagor plastic has Ea = 7, 64 Kal/mol K with A value = 10544, 9. The shelf life of <b>vanilla</b> <b>beans</b> that packaged with Polipropilen was 47 days, polietilen for 44 days, and zaack plastic for 43 days.

30|$|The {{curing process}} is an {{essential}} procedure {{for the production of}} vanilla flavor. This process induces destruction of tissue organization and reduces vanilla pod moisture. Furthermore, it creates conditions which allow the free flow of compartmentalized cellular constituents, resulting in enzyme-substrate interactions (Frenkel et al. 2011). Various biochemical and chemical reactions, such as esterification, etherification, and oxidative degradation, take place during this period to produce volatile compounds (Uzio and Derbesy 1989). However, the variations, especially those relating to the metabolism of vanilla fruits, still remain poorly constrained (Palama et al. 2009, 2011). Previous studies mainly focused on volatile compounds of <b>vanilla</b> <b>beans</b> but not on the overall metabolic fingerprints of vanilla fruits (Zhang and Christoph 2012; Pérez-Silva et al. 2006). This study applied untargeted metabolomic and chemometric analysis, indicating a notable differentiation between vanilla pods and <b>vanilla</b> <b>beans.</b> As shown in Figs.  3 and 4, PCA and PLS-DA demonstrated a clear and statistically significant separation of vanilla pods and <b>vanilla</b> <b>beans.</b> The substantial changes were observed in the metabolite composition of <b>vanilla</b> <b>beans.</b> Results showed that the curing process could give rise to metabolite changes in <b>vanilla</b> <b>beans</b> even though they contained similar metabolites in vanilla pods. This could be attributed to the effect of the different environmental microbes during the curing process. As shown in Additional file 1 : Figure S 1, the stability of glucovanillin ion strength showed that it was mainly involved in the metabolic pathway of vanillin biosynthesis and did not participate in other metabolic ways during the curing process, and the ion strength divergence of the other compounds indicated they not only participated in the vanillin biosynthesis, but were also involved in other flavors formation by the microbial metabolism.|$|R

30|$|The {{metabolic}} {{profiles of}} vanilla pods and <b>vanilla</b> <b>beans</b> illustrated that the metabolome of vanilla fruits were mainly dominated by 5648  m/z. According to the m/z analysis, the vanilla pods showed significant differences from <b>vanilla</b> <b>beans.</b> In addition, 21 precursors related to vanillin synthesis were identified, and 7 pathways of vanillin biosynthesis were constructed, including glucovanillin, glucose, cresol, capsaicin, vanillyl alcohol, tyrosine, and phenylalanine pathways. To {{the best of}} our knowledge, the glucose, cresol, capsaicin, and vanillyl alcohol pathways have not yet been reported in any vanilla curing process. However, these pathways have wide range of distribution in microbial metabolism. Therefore, microorganisms may have participated in vanillin biosynthesis during the curing of vanilla.|$|R
