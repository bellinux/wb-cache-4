We have assembled a system {{that allows us to}} extract the video data from the DVDs as they were encoded for distribution. Analyzing the resulting video trace data, we describe how DVD encodings have evolved over time. In addition, our findings show that the underlying video content is fundamentally different than those produced by basic consumer <b>video</b> <b>capture</b> <b>boards.</b> We demonstrate how this affects current video modeling proposals and their affect on network traffic characterization.

40|$|Introduction The {{last few}} years have seen a {{remarkable}} growth of information in digital form due {{to a combination of}} several technological factors that include the availability of high speed electronic networks and affordable yet powerful desktop computing. This coupled with advances in scientific and consumer imaging technology - digital radiography, digital still cameras, desktop scanners, <b>video</b> <b>capture</b> <b>boards,</b> has created an environment where a large fraction of digital information is being created and disseminated in visual form - graphics, images, and video. This trend towards information in visual form is not surprising considering that we use vision more than any other sense to acquire and communicate information. The information in visual form differs from traditional database information in many important ways. First, it requires more space for storage. For example, a color image of size 640 x 480 pixels requires almost one million bytes for storage in uncompressed form...|$|R
40|$|The retail {{industry}} offers many applications for a <b>video</b> <b>capture</b> <b>board,</b> such as video surveillance. To {{meet the demands}} of the industry, a <b>video</b> <b>capture</b> <b>board</b> must have high resolution, a universal interface, and inexpensive components. In addition, the board must have drivers and software to support it on a personal computer. This software must be easy to use and have the ability to load and store captured images. A <b>video</b> <b>capture</b> <b>board</b> was designed and constructed to meet these requirements. This board accepts any NTSC video signal, digitizes a single field in one pass, and transmits the video data to a personal computer via a parallel printer port. Parts for this board are commercially available and inexpensive, with an overall board cost of under $ 100. Software was also designed to support the board on an IBM-compatible computer running Microsoft Windows. This software provides an attractive interface to the board and has features desired for a video surveillance application, such as capturing video and storin...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} a {{tremendous}} increase in the use of digital video through computer systems. However, in many applications, the video size and frame rate suffer from the fact that enormous amounts of bandwidth and storage space are still required by digital video. Nevertheless, home and industry level computers have become powerful enough to decompress and display good quality video through the use of specialized hardware such as <b>video</b> <b>capture</b> <b>boards</b> and <b>video</b> display cards without using up all CPU cycles: we now have the ability to process video in real-time. Research on video processing is still at an early stage but is now attracting attention. Concepts such as motion detection, object tracking and object recognition can be very useful in many applications and have become more feasible. Another area that could benefit from new video processing algorithms is video indexing in multimedia database systems. Compression of video allows it to be stored in vast quantity, but the problem is the retrieval of video that has been stored. Multiple techniques can be used to accelerate the video search process but most of them do not help in understanding the contents of the video, which often must be done manually. In this thesis, a moving objects identification algorithm called SmartID has been designed. It brings some level of improvement in many sectors of computerized video, but in particular in the three sectors mentioned above: video compression, video processing applications and video indexing. This research also encompassed the design and implementation of a digital video surveillance application that demonstrates the usefulness of the algorithm...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a stand-alone network-based <b>video</b> <b>capture</b> and processing peripheral (the Vidboard) for a distributed multimedia system centered around a gigabit-per-second Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network. The Vidboard <b>captures</b> <b>video</b> from an analog NTSC television source and transmits it to devices within the system. Devices control the Vidboard through {{a set of}} ATM protocols. Whereas <b>capture</b> <b>boards</b> typically generate <b>video</b> streams having fixed frame rate characteristics, the Vidboard is capable of decoupling video from the real-time constraints of the television world. This allows easier integration of video into the software environment of computer systems. The Vidboard is based on a front-end frame-memory processor architecture that is also capable of generating full-motion video streams having a range of presentation (picture size, color space) and network (traffic, pixel packing) characteristics. A series of experiments are presented in which video is transmitted to a workstation for display. Frame rate performance and a remote video source control model are described...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Because of {{the higher}} {{incidence}} of malignant melanoma, researchers are concerned more and more with the automated diagnosis of skin lesions. We investigate in this paper the application of genetic algorithms for recognizing {{the images of the}} same melanocytic nevus taken at different moments of time. The idea is that a novel view of an object can be recognized by simply matching it to combinations of known views of the same object. The main difficulty in implementing this idea is determining the parameters of the combination of views. The space of parameters is very large and we propose a genetic approach to search this space efficiently. The effectiveness of this approach is shown on a set of real images captured with a camera and a <b>video</b> <b>capture</b> <b>board</b> under different angles of view.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Existing charge-coupled device (CCD) video cameras have been modified to be used for astronomical imaging on telescopes in order to improve imaging times over those of photography. An astronomical CCD camera at the Texas A&M Observatory would enhance the Observational Astronomy program by allowing one to make high resolution observations. A general purpose CCD camera was modified to be mounted on a 14 inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope to perform astronomical imaging. A <b>video</b> <b>capture</b> <b>board</b> on a personal computer was used to digitize the CCD video images. In addition, an image intensifier was placed on top of the CCD to increase low-light sensitivity. The capabilities of this system were then tested. The CCD and image intensifier combination can see stars as faint as magnitude 12. 9 at the normal video frame rate of 30 frames per second. While the resolution of this system is poorer than that of the telescope, it does make relatively high resolution measurements of faint objects much faster than unaided telescopes allows. A detailed discussion of this system and its capabilities will be presented...|$|E
40|$|A {{vision system}} that {{includes}} a specially designed video camera and an image-data-processing computer is under development as a prototype of robotic systems for visual inspection of the interior surfaces of pipes and especially of gas pipelines. The system is capable of providing both forward views and mosaicked radial views that can be displayed in real time or after inspection. To avoid the complexities associated with moving parts and to provide simultaneous forward and radial views, the video camera {{is equipped with a}} wide-angle (> 165) fish-eye lens aimed along the axis of a pipe to be inspected. Nine white-light-emitting diodes (LEDs) placed just outside the field of view of the lens (see Figure 1) provide ample diffuse illumination for a high-contrast image of the interior pipe wall. The video camera contains a 2 / 3 -in. (1. 7 -cm) charge-coupled-device (CCD) photodetector array and functions according to the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) standard. The video output of the camera is sent to an off-the-shelf <b>video</b> <b>capture</b> <b>board</b> (frame grabber) by use of a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) interface in the computer, which is of the 400 -MHz, Pentium II (or equivalent) class. Prior video-mosaicking techniques are applicable to narrow-field-of-view (low-distortion) images of evenly illuminated, relatively flat surfaces viewed along approximately perpendicular lines by cameras that do not rotate and that move approximately parallel to the viewed surfaces. One such technique for real-time creation of mosaic images of the ocean floor involves the use of visual correspondences based on area correlation, during both the acquisition of separate images of adjacent areas and the consolidation (equivalently, integration) of the separate images into a mosaic image, in order to insure that there are no gaps in the mosaic image. The data-processing technique used for mosaicking in the present system also involves area correlation, but with several notable differences: Because the wide-angle lens introduces considerable distortion, the image data must be processed to effectively unwarp the images (see Figure 2). The computer executes special software {{that includes a}}n unwarping algorithm that takes explicit account of the cylindrical pipe geometry. To reduce the processing time needed for unwarping, parameters of the geometric mapping between the circular view of a fisheye lens and pipe wall are determined in advance from calibration images and compiled into an electronic lookup table. The software incorporates the assumption that the optical axis of the camera is parallel (rather than perpendicular) to the direction of motion of the camera. The software also compensates for the decrease in illumination with distance from the ring of LEDs...|$|E
