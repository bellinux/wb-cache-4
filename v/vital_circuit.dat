60|$|But if {{the child}} thus seeks the mother, does it then know the mother alone? To an infant the mother is the whole universe. Yet the child needs more than the mother. It needs as well the {{presence}} of men, the vibration from the present body of the man. There may not be any actual, palpable connection. But from the great voluntary center in the man pass unknowable communications and unreliable nourishment of the stream of manly blood, rays which we cannot see, and which {{so far we have}} refused to know, but none the less essential, quickening dark rays which pass from the great dark abdominal life-center in the father to the corresponding center in the child. And these rays, these vibrations, are not like the mother-vibrations. Far, far from it. They do not need the actual contact, the handling and the caressing. On the contrary, the true male instinct is to avoid physical contact with a baby. It may not need even actual presence. But present or absent, there should be between the baby and the father that strange, intangible communication, that strange pull and circuit such as the magnetic pole exercises upon a needle, a vitalistic pull and flow which lays all the life-plasm of the baby into the line of vital quickening, strength, knowing. And any lack of this <b>vital</b> <b>circuit,</b> this vital interchange between father and child, man and child, means an inevitable impoverishment to the infant.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{unpublished}} poem “Annuaire Confidentiel” (undated) by António Pedro, which {{belongs to}} the estate of the Belgian surrealist E. L. T. Mesens, calls for a reflection on the author’s literary and pictorial production. Without denying surrealism, what it draws on is, above all, abjectionism, tracing a <b>vital</b> <b>circuit</b> which aproximates art and life. On the other hand, on the path towards dimensionism, of which the author {{was one of the}} pioneers, this poem represents a visuality that relates it to the pictorial arts in general and “Le crachat embelli” (1934) in particular. I propose to consider here these intertextual practices, so valued during that period, where the conceptual metaphor prevails, through the analysis of a poetic story told by a misreading that is fundamentally based on the processes that H. Bloom calls tessera and apophrades. Both ‘texts’ expose a sense of unease, denounce representative conventions and pursue the regeneration of the imaginary, grounded in an exploration of the unconscious governed by the poetics of the ugly. As “Le crachat embelli” and “Annuaire Confidentiel” interpenetrate each other, both make the dynamism of hidden desire throb in the distorted depths of a self who flees from circumstance to ecstasy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Sense {{amplifiers}} are extensively used in memory. Sense amplifiers {{are one of}} {{the most}} <b>vital</b> <b>circuits</b> in the periphery of CMOS memories. We know that memory is the heart of all digital systems. Today all worlds are demanding high speed and low power dissipation as well as small area. We know that speed and power dissipation of memory is overall depends upon the sense amplifier we used and their performance strongly affects both memory access time, and overall memory power dissipation. So it is important to design a good sense amplifier which performs well in both speed and power dissipation. In this dissertation, an implementation of a most efficient sense amplifier is done by comparing the best known sense amplifier in today. The dissertation focuses on design, simulation and performance analysis of sense amplifiers. In this thesis, current latch sense amplifier and body bias controlled current latch sense amplifier are designed and results compared. The result shows that the body bias controlled current latch sense amplifier is performing best. The result also shows a novel sense amplifier which consumes small power at same time its speed is faster than other sense amplifiers...|$|R
40|$|Lithium ferro {{phosphate}} (LiFePO 4) {{batteries are}} stable {{in terms of their}} thermal and chemical characteristics and have a high potential for wide use in the future. A battery model that predicts current-voltage (I-V) performance with high accuracy is <b>vital</b> for <b>circuit</b> designers so they can design circuits to control the usage of the battery and improve its runtime and its safety during use. In this paper, a battery model with two resistance- capacitance (RC) parallel networks is used for modelling and the values for parameters are divided into two sets; one for loaded conditions and the other for unloaded conditions. A methodology of transient response correction is proposed for formulating the parameters of the loaded condition. The steps for parameter extraction are discussed and the proposed battery model is validated using data from several experiments. The comparison between experiment and simulation results shows that the proposed model is capable of predicting I-V performance of the battery with very little error...|$|R

40|$|Scaling of {{technology}} leads to both a countable number and random position of dopants in the channel region (Fig. 1), known as random dopants fluctuations (RDF), which affects <b>vital</b> device and <b>circuit</b> performance parameters (delay, transconductunce, etc).

However, existing simulation methods and analytical models for RDF fail to meet the requirements for small computational time and accuracy simultaneously.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Many {{organisms are}} exposed to harsh {{environmental}} conditions that may impair the operation of <b>vital</b> neuronal <b>circuits</b> and imperil the animal before these conditions directly cause cell and tissue death. Prior exposure to extreme but sub-lethal stress has long-term effects on neural circuit function enabling motor pattern generators to operate under previously non-permissive conditions. Using several model sys-tems we have been investigating the mechanisms underlying stress-mediated neuroprotection, particularly thermotolerance imparted by a prior heat shock. Prior anoxia and cold shock also impart thermotolerance of motor pattern generation suggesting that different stressors activate common protective pathways. Syn-aptic transmission, action potential generation and neuronal potassium conductance are modulated by prior heat shock. Pharmacological block of potassium channels, which increases the duration of action potentials and the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials, mimics the thermoprotective effect of a prior heat shock. A universal consequence of heat shock and other stresses is the increased expression of a suite of heat shock proteins of which HSP 70 is most closely linked to organismal thermotolerance. Increased levels of HSP 70 are sufficient, but not necessary for synaptic thermoprotection. Accumulating evidence suggests the existence of multiple, overlapping pathways for protection and that these mechanisms may be neuron specific de-pending on their functional roles...|$|R
50|$|This problem {{does not}} occur when using the 'gauge B' (BPO) phone {{connector}} (PO 316) which although it is of 0.25 in (6.3 mm) diameter has a smaller tip and a recessed ring so that the ground contact of the socket never touches the tip or ring of the plug. This type was designed for balanced audio use, being the original telephone 'switchboard' connector and is still common in broadcast, telecommunications and many professional audio applications where it is <b>vital</b> that permanent <b>circuits</b> being monitored (bridged) are not interrupted by the insertion or removal of connectors. This same tapered shape used in the 'gauge B' (BPO) plug can be seen also in aviation and military applications on various diameters of jack connector including the PJ-068 and 'bantam' plugs.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 The {{central focus}} of this thesis is the design, {{fabrication}} and characterization of amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) thin-film transistor (TFT) current mirrors. The thin-film deposition and circuit fabrication methods used to realize zinc tin oxide (ZTO) TFT current mirrors are {{addressed in order to}} elucidate the processing challenges for this material system. Accurate current mirror behavior is demonstrated for current mirrors with small mirroring ratios. Deviations from the ideal mirroring ratio are attributed to three primary sources: TFT geometric mismatch, threshold voltage mismatch, and finite output resistance. The most significant source of mirroring error for the current mirrors fabricated is geometric mismatch associated with processing. Variations in TFT size leading to mirroring error arise from the use of mylar masks, inconsistent channel etching, and lift-off patterning of source-drain contacts. Geometric mismatch must be reduced before the effects of threshold voltage mismatch and finite output resistance on mirroring error can be unambiguously assessed. TFT size variation, and thus mirroring error, can be reduced by using chrome masks, developing an improved channel etch, avoiding lift-off processing and utilizing more sophisticated circuit layout. The work of this thesis continues to support the use of AOS for a variety of applications. Current mirrors are a <b>vital</b> analog <b>circuit</b> building block, used in a multitude of circuits, without which the scope of AOS-based electronics will be limited. The successful realization of such a circuit in ZTO, despite the processing challenges, bolsters the case that AOS can be used in the next stage of large-area electronics...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn {{order to reduce}} environmental pollution, reduce dependability from foreign energy sources, and avoid the uncertainty associated with an unpredictable rise {{in the price of}} oil, the use of alternative forms of energy is in worldwide demand. A popular and rapidly developing alternative form of energy is wind energy. The use of wind energy on a naval ship {{is the subject of this}} thesis. A preliminary feasibility study has been undertaken in order to evaluate wind energy potential and drawbacks. As expected, installation of a wind turbine on a ship must meet several conflicting requirements and is subject to environmental uncertainties. Such uncertainties are in turn coupled with the geographic area of operations of the ship, which makes the problem highly dependent on the overall operational concept and mission of the ship. A coupled ocean/atmosphere mesoscale prediction software (COAMPS) developed by the Naval Research Laboratory is used in order to obtain realistic wind profiles. During this study, the <b>vital</b> electrical <b>circuit</b> elements of the hybrid system are analyzed along with their performance and restrictions of their use. The operational requirements of the ship are taken into account with regards to tower and turbine sizing and its position on the ship as well as all relevant naval architecture characteristics of the ship after installation. A hybrid system is designed and analyzed to cope with the uncertainty associated with wind power. Finally, an economic evaluation of the hybrid system is performed, in order to evaluate if and under what circumstances the use of the hybrid system is a profitable investment.

40|$|Modern CMOS {{processes}} in the Deep Submicron regime are restricted to supply voltages below 2 volts and further {{to account for the}} transistors' field strength limitations and to reduce the power per logic gate. To maintain the high switching performance, the threshold voltage must be scaled according with the supply voltage. However, this leads to an increased subthreshold current of the transistors in standby mode (V GS = 0). Another source of leakage is gate current, which becomes significant for gate oxides of 3 nm and below. We propose a S elf- B iasing V irtual R ails (SBVR) - CMOS technique which acts like an adaptive local supply voltage in case of standby mode. Most important sources of leakage currents are reduced by this technique. Moreover, SBVR-CMOS is capable of conserving stored information in sleep mode, which is <b>vital</b> for memory <b>circuits.</b> Memories are exposed to radiation causing soft errors. This well-known problem becomes even worse in standby mode of typical SRAMs, that have low driving performance to withstand alpha particle hits. In this paper, a 16 -transistor SRAM cell is proposed, which combines the advantage of extremely low leakage currents with a very high soft error stability...|$|R
40|$|Restoration of {{movement}} following {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI) has been achieved using electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles. However, practical limitations such as the rapid onset of muscle fatigue hinder clinical application of these technologies. Recently, direct stimulation of alpha motor neurons has shown promise for evoking graded, controlled, and sustained muscle contractions in rodent and feline animal models while overcoming some of these limitations. However, small animal models are not optimal {{for the development of}} clinical spinal stimulation techniques for functional restoration {{of movement}}. Furthermore, variance in surgical procedure, targeting, and electrode implantation techniques can compromise therapeutic outcomes and impede comparison of results across studies. Herein, we present a protocol and large animal model that allow standardized development, testing, and optimization of novel clinical strategies for restoring motor function following spinal cord injury. We tested this protocol using both epidural and intraspinal stimulation in a porcine model of spinal cord injury, but the protocol is suitable for the development of other novel therapeutic strategies. This protocol will help characterize spinal <b>circuits</b> <b>vital</b> for selective activation of motor neuron pools.

40|$|Astrocytes are non-neuronal cells tiling {{the entire}} central nervous systems. They are <b>vital</b> for neural <b>circuit</b> {{function}} but {{have traditionally been}} viewed as simple, homogenous cells that serve the same essential supportive roles everywhere. However, astrocytes are subject to intrinsic noise, signaling pathways and control mechanisms leading to a cell-to-cell variability, whose functional relevance poorly remains poorly understood. Recent evidence indicated that single astrocytes release variable concentrations of lactate in response to stimulation, raising {{the possibility that they}} have different energy metabolisms. To investigate this hypothesis, we used high-content screening methods to monitor at the single cell level the variability in cellular ATP level in cultured astrocytes. An automated image analysis pipeline enabled the time-resolved quantification of both, the single-cell ATP level and the coefficient of variation in a cellular population. At resting state, astrocytes exhibited a significant variability in cellular ATP levels. As previously reported, glutamate induced a decrease in cellular ATP levels that recovered after stimulation. During the glutamatergic stimulation, the heterogeneity in the cellular ATP level decreased, suggesting that the decrease in cellular energy status is potentially regulated to avoid decreasing below a biological threshold. Interestingly, the cytosolic ATP level increased during recovery to a similar level among cells, independently from their basal cellular ATP which further decreased the heterogeneity in cellular ATP levels after stimulation. Therefore, our results suggest that glutamatergic stimulation decreases the heterogeneity in energy metabolism in astrocytes. We speculate that the change in metabolic heterogeneity aims to prime the population to answer more rapidly a next stimulation challenge...|$|R
