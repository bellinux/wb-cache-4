40|$|In {{the present}} 'learning society' {{continuous}} or lifelong learning {{is important for}} everyone, for the individual {{as well as for}} society and its organizations and institutions. While the sustainability of the diploma and the job "for life" decreases, the usefulness and necessity of lifelong learning to enable people to maintain or improve their position in society increases. This study is about <b>Valuing</b> <b>Learning,</b> or themeaning, form and content of lifelong learning. The main subject is the linkage between the systematics of Validation of Prior Learning (VPL) and the process of personalised learning. <b>Valuing</b> <b>Learning</b> is a dualistic concept, which concerns both <b>valuing</b> <b>Learning</b> and learning Valuing. It is based on valuing by people themselves and by organisations within the learning system, and the social system of all the learning that people have done independently of learning programmes. However, the converse is also true, namely learning to value these types of learning experiences from the belief that something can always be learned, irrespective of the time and place. The notion that everybody actually learns throughout their entire lifetimes, and that much of this learning can be made visible, is the link between the function of learning as seen {{from the perspective of the}} individual, organisation and 'school'. This is what the Valuing Learningconcept expresses. VPL is a system which, independent of the form of learning (formal, non-formal, informal), focuses on recognising, valuing, validating and developing the competences that someone has previously learned in any kind of learning environment. Personalised learning is the dynamic learning concept focused on the individual learner, which can initiate (or help initiate) and establish tailored individual learning programmes in a learning culture based on self-driven, flexible, prospective lifelong learning. While VPL identifies the potential value of a person's learning, personalised learning presupposes that VPL can support somebody’s contribution to the dialogue with other actors on the meaning, form and content of learning. VPL and personalized learning are processes that allow the learning individual to take on an active role in achieving personal and social perspective. The relationship between the two processes is examined at the level of theory, policy and empiricism. The outcome of the research is that VPL for personalized learning can be valuable for all actors in the learning triangle – individual/organisation/’school’ - as long as they can and want to switch between their objectives, approach and identity. The deployment of VPL for personalized learning can demonstrably enhance the dialogues on meaning, content and form of learning within this triangle. It is this understanding that the acceptance and practical application of VPL for personalized learning supports. But it is above all the individual who learns, not the organisation, ‘school’ or the system, with the concept of <b>Valuing</b> <b>Learning</b> as a driving force...|$|E

Increasing student engagement is proposed {{as a solution to}} this problem. However, there is disagreement amongst educationists about what it means for students to be engagement and how to best engage pupils. To improve conceptual clarity, a phenomenographic study was conducted to investigate how teachers understand the concept of student engagement. Six conceptual meanings of student engagement were found in the data. These were related to three conceptualized ways of supporting engagement. In the final category, teachers suggest that they can best support engagement by utilizing a collaborative approach with students, viewing student engagement as owning and <b>valuing</b> <b>learning.</b> This final position is the theoretically preferred approach. These results show that teachers do not share the same understandings of engagement and that some are more focused on engaging students in schooling rather than learning...|$|E
40|$|In Portugal, {{recognition}} and validation of prior learning {{has emerged as}} an important training practice. Since 2001, it has been possible to obtain an academic certification by <b>valuing</b> <b>learning,</b> regardless of its origin. The current {{study was conducted with}} trainers and adults who were involved in processes of recognition, validation and certification of competences (RVCC). This research study, using qualitative research methods, described and tried to develop the comprehension of the use of referentials as instruments of trainers’ activity. This analysis focused especially on three aspects: (i) the organization and development of RVCC processes; (ii) trainers’ role in these processes; and (iii) the use of a referential as an instrument of activity. The findings suggested that the referential used in these processes mediates trainers’ activity, functioning as competences identification guides. After an initial appropriation, trainers reconceptualize the referential by creating their own grids. There is clear variability in the use of this guiding document. Trainers revealed ambivalence towards the autonomy that they have in their work activity. Although they assess the opportunity to individually and freely create their work instruments in a positive way, they also lack a collective support and validation...|$|E
40|$|Adaptive {{management}} {{has a long}} history in the natural resource management literature, but despite this, few practitioners have developed adaptive strategies to conserve threatened species. Active adaptive management provides a framework for <b>valuing</b> <b>learning</b> by measuring the degree to which it improves long-run management outcomes. The challenge of an active adaptive approach is to find the correct balance between gaining knowledge to improve management in the future and achieving the best short-term outcome based on current knowledge. We develop and analyze a framework for active adaptive management of a threatened species. Our case study concerns a novel facial tumor disease affecting the Australian threatened species Sarcophilus harrisii: the Tasmanian devil. We use stochastic dynamic programming with Bayesian updating to identify the management strategy that maximizes the Tasmanian devil population growth rate, taking into account improvements to management through learning to better understand disease latency and the relative effectiveness of three competing management options. Exactly which management action we choose each year is driven by the credibility of competing hypotheses about disease latency and by the population growth rate predicted by each hypothesis under the competing management actions. We discover that the optimal combination of management actions depends on the number of sites available and the time remaining to implement management. Our approach to active adaptive management provides a framework to identify the optimal amount of effort to invest in learning to achieve long-run conservation objectives...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This article recounts {{and further}} explores some {{experimental}} scientific and didactic work {{trying to make}} use of the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari in early childhood didactics at the University of Stockholm, Sweden. Within the setting of problem- and practice-based cooperation, researchers and teachers have in different projects explored some of the concepts offered by Deleuze and Guattari and that seem capable of aligning themselves with young children’s strategies for learning as well as offering new and vital scientific and didactic tools. A thread through the article is the importance of and conditions needed for being able to really listen to children and take their questions seriously. The article begins with an argumentation on the need here for ‘creative thought ’ and a short description of how current attempts to tame learning block this thought and neglect children’s questions. Thereafter the article builds on examples of scientific and didactic work at the University of Stockholm where three concepts are explored: ‘assemblages of desire ’ – as a way of accessing children’s collective drive for learning; ‘event ’ – as a way of accessing children’s production of knowledge; and ‘affect ’ – as a way of <b>valuing</b> <b>learning</b> and knowledge in a way that differs from how it is being done within the formalised school system. The article is concluded with a discussion on children’s affinity with a creative thought and how this can be used to enrich the formalised school system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In a {{study to}} {{determine}} the site and preceptor characteristics most valued by clerks and residents in the ambulatory setting we wished to confirm whether these would support effective learning. The deep approach to learning {{is thought to be}} more effective for learning than surface approaches. In this study we determined how the approaches to learning of clerks and residents predicted the valued site and preceptor characteristics in the ambulatory setting. Methods Postal survey of all medical residents and clerks in training in Ontario determining the site and preceptor characteristics most valued in the ambulatory setting. Participants also completed the Workplace Learning questionnaire that includes 3 approaches to learning scales and 3 workplace climate scales. Multiple regression analysis was used to predict the preferred site and preceptor characteristics as the dependent variables by the average scores of the approaches to learning and perception of workplace climate scales as the independent variables. Results There were 1642 respondents, yielding a 47. 3 % response rate. Factor analysis revealed 7 preceptor characteristics and 6 site characteristics valued in the ambulatory setting. The Deep approach to learning scale predicted all of the learners' preferred preceptor characteristics (β = 0. 076 to β = 0. 234, p Direction was more strongly associated with the Surface Rational approach (β =. 252, p Surface Disorganized approach to learning (β =. 154, p Deep approach.

40|$|This {{report is}} a {{synthesis}} of ongoing research, design, and implementation of an approach to education called "connected learning. " It advocates for broadened access to learning that is socially embedded, interest-driven, and oriented toward educational, economic, or political opportunity. Connected learning is realized when a young person is able to pursue a personal interest or passion {{with the support of}} friends and caring adults, and is in turn able to link this learning and interest to academic achievement, career success or civic engagement. This model is based on evidence that the most resilient, adaptive, and effective learning involves individual interest as well as social support to overcome adversity and provide recognition. This report investigates how we can use new media to foster the growth and sustenance of environments that support connected learning in a broad-based and equitable way. This report also offers a design and reform agenda, grounded in a rich understanding of child development and learning, to promote and test connected learning theories. We begin with an analysis of current economic, social, and technical trends that frame the educational challenges faced by many countries, especially in the Global North [...] including the contraction of economic opportunity, growing inequity in access to educational and economic opportunity, and the risks and opportunities of media engagement. Connected learning addresses the gap between in-school and out-of-school learning, intergenerational disconnects, and new equity gaps arising from the privatization of learning. In doing so, connected learning taps the opportunities provided by digital media to more easily link home, school, community and peer contexts of learning; support peer and intergenerational connections based on shared interests; and create more connections with non-dominant youth, drawing from capacities of diverse communities. We also offer an approach to learning, design and program building that can expand the opportunities afforded by a changing media environment while minimizing the risks. Our approach draws on sociocultural learning theory in <b>valuing</b> <b>learning</b> that is embedded within meaningful practices and supportive relationships, and that recognizes diverse pathways and forms of knowledge and expertise. Our design model builds on this approach by focusing on supports and mechanisms for building environments that connect learning across the spheres of interests, peer culture, and academic life. We propose a set of design features that help build shared purpose, opportunities for production, and openly networked resources and infrastructure...|$|E

Em seu torno, surgem as tecnologias, a inovação, condições de mercado, prazos de entrega, qualidade e diversidade de produtos, etc. Assim, as empresas competitivas e concorrenciais são aquelas que investem na valorização dos Recursos Humanos. Este estudo realça que os problemas estruturais de Portugal prendem-se com o baixo nível de qualificação e de educação da população activa, o que influencia a produtividade das empresas. As deficiências da educação, devem-se ao insucesso escolar e ao fraco investimento em formação profissional. São referidas neste estudo, diversas perspectivas acerca desta questão, no âmbito da sociologia do trabalho e do emprego. Os dados estatísticos, reforçam que o investimento em formação contínua é diminuto, o que resulta num cenário desolador que nos coloca na cauda da Europa, revelando acentuadas assimetrias de oportunidades no acesso à formação profissional, tendo os trabalhadores menos escolarizados menores oportunidades, quer de aprendizagem, quer de condições de trabalho. No mundo do trabalho há um domínio do trabalho desqualificado e as condições de trabalho são precárias. A aprendizagem no posto de trabalho requer uma significativa mudança da mentalidade dos dirigentes das empresas portuguesas, ao nível da organização do tempo de trabalho, do investimento financeiro, valorização dos recursos humanos e na aprendizagem ao longo da vida profissional. Em suma, as empresas têm de apostar no processo de aprendizagem ao longo da vida.

In its lathe we witness the appearance of technologies innovation, market conditions stated periods of delivery, quality and diversity of products, etc. therefore, the competitive companies are those who invest development and assessment of the Human Resources. This study emphasizes that one of Portugal's Structural problem inhabits in low level of professional qualification and education to the active population which influence the productivity of the companies. The lack of instruction is due to school failure and to the weak investment in professional formation. This study also reveals several perspectives concerning this question, in the scope of sociology both of work and job. The statistics data strengthen that the investment in continuous formation is low, which results in a devastating scenario that places Portugal in the tail of Europe. This circumstances show that there are massive asymmetries in what concerns to chances in the access to professional formation. Consequently, Workers with less education are less qualification to access to professional formation. Consequently, workers with low education are less qualified to access to professional formation. Consequently workers with less education are low qualification to access opportunities, not only in what learning process concern but also in work conditions. Nowadays, on the labour world there are a great number of work ranks with poor contents and lack of motivation, with precarious conditions. Learning in work rank requires a significant change in the attitude of those who are in charge especially in what concerns, but also in work conditions.
