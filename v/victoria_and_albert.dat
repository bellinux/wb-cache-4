5|$|Victoria's {{household}} {{was largely}} run by her childhood governess, Baroness Louise Lehzen from Hanover.

Albert, however, thought Lehzen was incompetent, and that her mismanagement threatened his daughter's health. After a furious row between <b>Victoria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Albert</b> over the issue, Lehzen was pensioned off in 1842, and Victoria's close relationship with her ended.|$|E

5|$|Albert and Victoria {{were shot}} at again on both 29 and 30 May 1842, but were unhurt. The culprit, John Francis, was {{detained}} and condemned to death, {{although he was}} later reprieved. Some of their early unpopularity came about because of their stiffness and adherence to protocol in public, though in private the couple were more easy-going. In early 1844, <b>Victoria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Albert</b> were apart {{for the first time}} since their marriage when he returned to Coburg on the death of his father.|$|E
5|$|Although Watts {{received}} many offers {{to buy the}} painting, he had agreed to donate his most important works to the nation and felt {{it would be inappropriate}} not to include Hope. Consequently, later in 1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion Watts sold the original and donated the copy to the South Kensington Museum (now the <b>Victoria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Albert</b> Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. He painted at least two further versions for private sale.|$|E
5|$|Fewer than 95 deluxe {{editions of}} Agrippa are extant, {{although}} {{the exact number}} is unknown and {{is the source of}} considerable mystery. The <b>Victoria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Albert</b> Museum possesses a deluxe edition, numbered 4 of 10. A publicly accessible copy of the deluxe edition is available at the Rare Books Division of the New York Public Library and a small copy resides at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan, while the Frances Mulhall Achilles Library at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City hosts a promotional prospectus. The <b>Victoria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Albert</b> Museum's copy was first exhibited in a display entitled The Book and Beyond, held in the Museum's 20th Century Gallery from April to October 1995. The same copy was subsequently also included in a V display entitled Digital Pioneers, from 2009–2010. Another copy of the book was exhibited in the 2003–2004 exhibition Ninety from the Nineties at the New York Public Library. Gibson at one point claimed never to have seen a copy of the printed book, spurring speculation that no copies had actually been made. Many copies have since been documented, and Gibson's signature was noted on the copy held by the New York Public Library. In 2011, the Bodleian Library's Special Collections Department at the University of Oxford acquired Kevin Begos' copy of Agrippa, as well as the archive of Begos' papers related to the work.|$|E

5|$|In March 1861, Victoria's {{mother and}} Albert's aunt, the Duchess of Kent, died and Victoria was grief-stricken; Albert took {{on most of}} the Queen's duties, despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble. The last public event he presided over was the opening of the Royal Horticultural Gardens on 5 June 1861. In August, <b>Victoria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Albert</b> visited the Curragh Camp, Ireland, where the Prince of Wales was doing army service.
