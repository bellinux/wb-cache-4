First introduced in 1966, the APL\360 system was a multi-user interpreter.

2500|$|The {{importance}} of form was recognised from ancient times. Aristotle uses variable letters to represent valid inferences in Prior Analytics, leading Jan Łukasiewicz {{to say that}} the introduction of <b>variables</b> <b>was</b> [...] "one of Aristotle's greatest inventions". According to the followers of Aristotle (such as Ammonius), only the logical principles stated in schematic terms belong to logic, not those given in concrete terms. The concrete terms [...] "man", [...] "mortal", etc., are analogous to the substitution values of the schematic placeholders P, Q, R, which were called the [...] "matter" [...] (Greek hyle) of the inference.|$|E

2500|$|Some modern, language-specific IDEs (in {{contrast}} to text editors) perform full language parsing {{which results in}} very accurate understanding of code. An extension of syntax highlighting was called [...] "semantic highlighting" [...] in 2009 by David Nolden [...] for the open-source C++ IDE KDevelop. For example, semantic highlighting may give local variables unique distinct colors to improve the comprehensibility of code. In 2014 the idea of colored local <b>variables</b> <b>was</b> [...] further popularized due to a blog post by Evan Brooks, and after that, the idea was transferred to other popular IDEs like Visual Studio, Xcode, and others.|$|E
2500|$|According to Boris Golubov, BV {{functions}} {{of a single}} variable were first introduced by Camille Jordan, in the paper [...] dealing with the convergence of Fourier series. The first successful step in the generalization of this concept to {{functions of}} several <b>variables</b> <b>was</b> due to Leonida Tonelli, who introduced a class of continuous BV functions in 1926 , to extend his direct method for finding solutions to problems in the calculus of variations {{in more than one}} variable. Ten years after, in , Lamberto Cesari changed the continuity requirement in Tonelli's definition to a less restrictive integrability requirement, obtaining {{for the first time the}} class of functions of bounded variation of several variables in its full generality: as Jordan did before him, he applied the concept to resolve of a problem concerning the convergence of Fourier series, but for functions of two variables. After him, several authors applied BV functions to study Fourier series in several variables, geometric measure theory, calculus of variations, and mathematical physics. Renato Caccioppoli and Ennio de Giorgi used them to define measure of nonsmooth boundaries of sets (see the entry [...] "Caccioppoli set" [...] for further information). Olga Arsenievna Oleinik introduced her view of generalized solutions for nonlinear partial differential equations as functions from the space BV in the paper , and was able to construct a generalized solution of bounded variation of a first order partial differential equation in the paper : few years later, Edward D. Conway and Joel A. Smoller applied BV-functions to the study of a single nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equation of first order in the paper , proving that the solution of the Cauchy problem for such equations is a function of bounded variation, provided the initial value belongs to the same class. Aizik Isaakovich Vol'pert developed extensively a calculus for BV functions: in the paper [...] he proved the chain rule for BV functions and in the book [...] he, jointly with his pupil Sergei Ivanovich Hudjaev, explored extensively the properties of BV functions and their application. His chain rule formula was later extended by Luigi Ambrosio and Gianni Dal Maso in the paper [...]|$|E

50|$|A {{procedure}} brick was a procedure, {{which may}} or may not return a (scalar) value, have (scalar) parameters, or have local (scalar) variables.

50|$|Within each latent class, the {{observed}} <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> statistically independent. This {{is an important}} aspect.
