A.viridimontanum {{is one of}} only five taxa (four species and a <b>variety)</b> <b>that</b> are strictly endemic to serpentine in eastern North America, and two of these, A.aleuticum and Aspidotis densa, grow on non-serpentine substrates elsewhere in North America.|$|E
5|$|In April 2014, Orci and Kurtzman {{confirmed}} to <b>Variety</b> <b>that</b> {{they are no}} longer going to work together on film projects but will still collaborate on television. Kurtzman wanted to work on the Spider-Man film franchise, while Orci was linked to the directorial role for Star Trek 3. Orci confirmed later that year in July that he was not involved in the production of The Amazing Spider-Man 3 alongside Kurtzman. Orci and Kurtzman's K/O Paper Products continues to operate as a production company within CBS Television Studios, and has created the series Scorpion inspired by the life of Walter O'Brien for the 2014-15 season and Limitless was created for the 2015-16 season from the 2011 film.|$|E

On 17 February 2011, Filipino and Indian Greenpeace activists trespassed UPLB's Bay research farm and uprooted two Bt eggplants and more than 100 non-genetically modified eggplants. The National Academy of Science and Technology and ranking UPLB officials condemned the incident, and have taken legal action.|$|E

5|$|While not as {{prolific}} in mutating as Pinot noir, nor {{as widely}} used in production of offspring, Cabernet Sauvignon {{has been linked to}} other grape varieties. In 1961, a cross of Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache produced the French wine grape Marselan. Cygne blanc is a white-berried seedling of Cabernet Sauvignon that was discovered in 1989 growing in a garden in Swan Valley, Western Australia. Cabernet blanc is a crossing of Cabernet Sauvignon and an unknown hybrid grape <b>variety</b> <b>that</b> was discovered in Switzerland in the late 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, Riesling was {{sometimes}} {{claimed to have}} originated from wild vines of the Rhine region, without much support to back up that claim. More recently, DNA fingerprinting by Ferdinand Regner indicated that one parent of Riesling is Gouais blanc, known to the Germans as Weißer Heunisch, a <b>variety</b> <b>that,</b> while rare today, was widely grown by the French and German peasantry of the Middle Ages. The other parent is {{a cross between a}} wild vine and Traminer. It is presumed that the Riesling was born somewhere in the valley of the Rhine, since both Heunisch and Traminer have a long documented history in Germany, but with parents from either side of the Adriatic the cross could have happened anywhere on the way.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the Arveson-Douglas conjecture on the essential normality of homogeneous submodules corresponding to algebraic subvarieties {{of the unit}} ball. We prove that the property of essential normality is preserved by isomorphisms between varieties, and we establish a similar result for maps between <b>varieties</b> <b>that</b> are not necessarily invertible. We also relate the decomposability of an algebraic variety {{to the problem of}} establishing the essential normality of the corresponding submodule. These results are applied to prove that the Arveson-Douglas conjecture holds for submodules corresponding to <b>varieties</b> <b>that</b> decompose into linear subspaces, and <b>varieties</b> <b>that</b> decompose into components with mutually disjoint linear spans.
