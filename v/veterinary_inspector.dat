Professionals face conflicting situations due to potential clashes between multifaceted professional, organizational, and societal factors.

We investigate such conflicts, confusion, and coping strategies in a group of <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspectors.</b> Using semi-structured interviews, we analyse their work and link the resulting insights to different perspectives on professionalism.

This book contributes to our understanding of what drives public service professionals’ decision-making in real-life dilemma situations by looking into the combined effect of public service motivation (PSM) and professionalism. Because there are persistent knowledge gaps about the meaning and behavioural consequences of these concepts {{when it comes to the}} context of dilemma situations, this book presents new approaches to the study of PSM and professionalism. Another important contribution of this study is related to the discussion about the stability of PSM. Several hypotheses and propositions are put to the test within a mixed-method research design based on data from research on Dutch <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspectors.</b> The results show that in order to clarify the meaning and behavioural consequences of PSM and professionalism in the context of dilemmas it is useful to combine our understanding of these two concepts with insights from identity theory.

Despite an EWS being in place for a number of years, animal welfare incidents continue to occur. Questionnaires regarding welfare incidents were sent to Superintending <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Inspectors</b> (SVIs), resulting in 18 herds being chosen as case study herds, 12 of which had a clearly defined welfare incident date. For each study herd, data on six potential KPIs were extracted from DAFF databases. The KPIs for those herds with a clearly defined welfare incident date were studied for a consecutive four year window, with the fourth year being the 'incident year', when the welfare incident was disclosed. For study herds without a clearly defined welfare incident date, the KPIs were determined on a yearly basis between 2001 and 2009. Results We found that the late registration of calves, the use of on-farm burial as a method of carcase disposal, an increasing number of moves to knackeries over time and records of animals moved to 'herd unknown' were notable on the case farms.

40|$|Background: During the FMD {{outbreak}} in Ireland and the UK in 2001, there was significant uncertainty amongstveterinary practitioners and government <b>veterinary</b> <b>inspectors</b> surrounding the clinical diagnosis of FMD insheep. This situation was complicated by reports of idiopathic oral ulcers that closely resembled FMD ongross appearance which {{at that time}} were referred to as ovine mouth and gum obscure disease. Methods: A field and abattoir study was carried out to determine the frequency, appearance and significance of oraland digital lesions in sheep in Ireland. A total of 3, 263 sheep were examined in 22 flocks, including 1, 969 lambs and 1, 294 adults. A further 2, 403 animals were examined by abattoir inspections. Animals bearing lesions of interest were identified, samples of the lesions were taken and subsequently examined by bacteriology, electron microscopy, serology, immunohistochemistry and histopathology. Results: Forty four oral and 20 digital lesions were identified and characterised. Oral lesions were recorded mostfrequently in lambs, where {{the most common cause}} was orf virus infection. The majority of the oral lesions recorded in the adults was idiopathic and consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic oral ulceration. A variety of digital lesions was observed, consistent with scald, foot-rot and contagious ovine digital dermatitis (CODD). All of the animals with lesions were seronegative to FMD virus (FMDV). Conclusions: There was no difficulty in differentiating these lesions from those caused by FMDV on the basis of flockhistory and careful clinical examination...|$|R

In 1887, he was excluded from the seminary for his rebellious ideas, but restored again in 1889. From 1890 to 1895 he studied at the Warsaw veterinary college, where he engaged in a student underground society.

Aragvispireli brought his personal working experience into a series of short stories from 1895 and quickly won popularity. One of his best stories, It's Earth (მიწაა) appeared in 1901. It was a story of a consumptive Georgian convict exiled to Siberia and killed there for refusing to throw away a bag of Georgian earth he has kept for his grave. Aragvispireli married contemporary European influences, particularly Maupassant and Przybyszewski to native traditions of idealization of the primitive typical to the Georgian mountaineer writers such as Alexander Kazbegi. In his drama Shio the Prince (შიო თავადი, 1905), he took a Symbolist view of Georgian history, but it failed. His most successful work, the novel A Fractured Heart (გაბზარული გული, 1920), was a sentimental fairy-tale of the love of a princess and a goldsmith. It even earned appraisal from the Soviet critics who had frequently attacked Aragvispireli’s gruesome Expressionism. His later years were unproductive.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. This project investigates how animal disease is regulated by veterinarians in England and Wales. The {{research focuses on}} bovine tuberculosis (TB) and {{the process by which}} infected cattle are detected. Vets in private practices conduct thousands of tests each year on behalf of the government to help manage the disease. TB tests should be conducted according to a strict protocol, but government vets are concerned about the lack of standardization. The research therefore investigated how vets conduct TB tests and why testing practices deviate from the protocol. Drawing on approaches from the sociology of health and environmental regulation, this project will investigate (1) the importance of acting as regulators to veterinary practices, (2) the social interactions between vets and farmers during regulation (3) the difficulties vets encounter when delivering regulation in challenging environments (4) the contribution regulation makes to job satisfaction and the coping strategies they adopt and (5) the wider animal health benefits that arise from regulation. Project description: The research examines the role of Local <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Inspectors</b> in testing cattle for bovine tuberculosis- a major animal disease affecting cattle in England and Wales. The project will use an in-depth ethnographic approach of veterinary practices located in England and Wales, state vets working in Animal Health, and interviews with policy makers. Veterinarians are key actors in the regulation of animal health. Recent animal health crises have heightened awareness of the need for effective regulatory practices and techniques to control the spread of animal diseases. Policy makers have been keen to harness the power of local vets in the regulation of animal health. Vets are seen as trusted and effective advisers by policy makers and the agricultural industry alike...|$|R
