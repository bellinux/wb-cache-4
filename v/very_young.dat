5|$|From the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 CE) {{until the}} modern period (1840–1919), {{scholars}} and rulers developed a male-dominated patriarchal society in China. Confucianism {{was at the}} root of the development of the patriarchal society in China, and emphasized the distinctions between the sexes and the roles they have within the family. These ideologies continued through the Tang dynasty (618-907), and girls were taught from a <b>very</b> <b>young</b> age to be submissive to their fathers, then to their husbands, and later to their sons. During the Song Dynasty (960-1297), Confucian scholars further developed the patriarchal tradition with more restrictions for females, including foot binding for girls at a <b>very</b> <b>young</b> age.|$|E

5|$|The {{veterinary}} uses of clindamycin {{are quite}} similar to its human indications, and include treatment of osteomyelitis, skin infections, and toxoplasmosis, {{for which it is}} the preferred drug in dogs and cats.

5|$|A {{mammalian}} virus, {{the rabbit}} haemorrhagic disease virus {{was introduced to}} Australia to attempt to control the European rabbit populations there. It escaped from quarantine and spread across the country, killing large numbers of rabbits. <b>Very</b> <b>young</b> animals survived, passing immunity to their offspring in due course and eventually producing a virus-resistant population. Introduction into New Zealand in the 1990s was similarly successful at first, but a decade later, immunity had developed and populations had returned to pre-RHD levels.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids also exhibit both {{schooling}} and shoaling behaviours. <b>Very</b> <b>young</b> bigfin reef squids will also stay close together (shoaling), {{but do not}} swim together {{parallel to each other}} (schooling).

Shoals can include animals of different sizes without the threat of larger members attacking and consuming the smaller members. Whether bigfin reef squids recognise each other individually still remains unknown.|$|E
