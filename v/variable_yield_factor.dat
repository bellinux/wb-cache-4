50|$|While {{absolute}} grain yield variations {{exist between}} different global locations {{as cited in}} this article, the potential for improved rain fed grain yields may be less than is suggested by a comparison between sub-Saharan and European locations for example, this applies particularly in areas where grain yield is primarily determined by the growing season rainfall. A more accurate formula for measuring yield potential is y x a = X, where X is grain yield in Kg/hectare, y is millimetres of growing season rainfall and a is the <b>variable</b> <b>yield</b> <b>factor,</b> a number that may vary somewhere between 5 and 20. Thus assuming a <b>variable</b> <b>yield</b> <b>factor</b> of 15 and a growing season rainfall of 220mm the formula would express as 220mm x 15 = 3300 kg/ha yield potential.This formula, while not taking account of either the carryover benefits of stored rainfall in the soil profile resulting from out of season rainfall or the impact of temperature or soil fertility, still gives a more accurate picture {{of the degree to}} which actual grain yields are matching the region's potential yields and is a better basis for comparison between very different regions such as Europe and the sub-Sahara.A European yield of 5000 kg/ha from a rainfall of 500mm results in a <b>variable</b> <b>yield</b> <b>factor</b> of 10 while a yield of 2500 kg/ha in a 200mm rainfall area has a <b>variable</b> <b>yield</b> <b>factor</b> of 12.5, in such an example the lower yielding crop has actually been 25% more efficient in its rainfall utilisation than the higher yielding crop. Agronomy needs to be based on attaining the highest possible <b>variable</b> <b>yield</b> <b>factor</b> rather than the highest absolute yield, factor numbers as high as 17+ are achievable.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{current study}} {{evaluated}} {{part of the}} Multifactorial Model of Driving Safety to elucidate {{the relative importance of}} cognitive function and a limited range of standard measures of visual function in relation to the Capacity to Drive Safely. Capacity to Drive Safely was operationalized using three validated screening measures for older drivers.

Results: Factor analysis of these predictor <b>variables</b> <b>yielded</b> <b>factors</b> including Executive/Speed, Vision (measured by visual acuity and contrast sensitivity), Spatial, Visual Closure, and Working Memory. Cognitive and Vision factors explained 83 - 95 % of age-related variance in the Capacity to Drive Safely. Spatial and Working Memory were associated with UFOV, HPT and HCDT, Executive/Speed was associated with UFOV and HCDT and Vision was associated with HPT. Conclusion: The Capacity to Drive Safely declines with chronological age, and this decline is associated with age-related declines in several higher order cognitive abilities involving manipulation and storage of visuospatial information under speeded conditions. There are also age-independent effects of cognitive function and vision that determine driving safety...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{investigated}} preference, perceived danger, {{and fear}} for {{a sample of}} 70 field/forest settings. Predictor variables included perception-based variables (visual access, penetration,movement ease), information-based variables (mystery, concealment, refuge), and variables thought to intervene between concealment and danger (entrapment, rearview concern). All variables were rated by independent groups. Danger and fear were strongly positively correlated for these settings, but preference and danger had a more modest negative correlation. Factor analysis of the strongly inter-correlated predictor <b>variables</b> <b>yielded</b> two <b>factors,</b> interpreted as Visibility and Locomotor Access. Both factors were positive predictors of preference and negative predictors of danger. Further analyses suggested feelings of entrapment could mediate the positive relation between concealment and danger and that after controlling for other indicators of visibility, mystery has a positive relation to preference. In general, the role of visual and locomotor access in accounting for preference or danger reactions is highlighted by these findings...|$|R

40|$|Benchmarking data {{provided}} by 144 organisations across four industry sectors are consolidated and mined to generate insights into the relationship between complaints-handling processes, as defined in ISO 10002, the International Standard for Complaints Handling, {{and a number of}} marketing-related outcomes. Factor analysis of the 17 complaints-handling process <b>variables</b> <b>yields</b> five <b>factors</b> accounting for 62. 6 % of the overall variance. The most important factors are: visibility and accessibility of the complaints-handling policy and process; easy-to-use process for all complainants; and responsiveness of the complaints-handling process. Collectively these factors account for 24 % {{of the variance in the}} desired marketing-related outcomes, most notably levels of customer advocacy and customer satisfaction. Although there have been a number of empirical investigations of International Standards, this is the first empirical study to investigate the influence of ISO 10002 -conformant complaints-handling processes on marketing-related and broader outcomes. We conclude that complaints-handling processes that conform to ISO 10002 can yield significant marketing-related benefits, and we make recommendations for marketing practitioners. 22 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the risks faced by fed cattle producers. With the development of livestock insurance programs as part of the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000, a thorough investigation into the probabilistic measures of individual risk factors is needed. This research jointly models cattle production <b>yield</b> risk <b>factors,</b> using a multivariate dynamic regression model. A multivariate framework is necessary to characterize yield risk in terms of four <b>yield</b> <b>factors</b> (dry matter feed conversion, averaged daily gain, mortality, and veterinary costs), which are highly correlated. Additionally, a conditional Tobit model is used to handle censored <b>yield</b> <b>variables</b> (e. g., mortality). The proposed econometric model estimates parameters that influence the mean and variance of each production <b>yield</b> <b>factor,</b> as well as the covariance between variables. Following the model fitting using a maximum likelihood approach, simulation methods allow for profits, revenue, and gross margins to be evaluated given different assumptions concerning volatility among other shocks. The profit function is composed of random draws, based on conditioning variables, as well as parameter estimates. Shocks to variability, <b>yield</b> <b>factors,</b> or prices allow for a visual representation of the vulnerability of cattle feeder profits to these shocks. Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|The term {{structure}} {{of interest rates}} is often summarized using a handful of <b>yield</b> <b>factors</b> that capture shifts {{in the shape of}} the yield curve.

We show that the level of the short-rate is useful in modeling the volatility of the three <b>yield</b> <b>factors</b> and that there is significant GARCH effects present even after including a level effect. We also study the effect of interest rate volatility on the level of the <b>yield</b> <b>factors</b> and report evidence that is consistent with a ”flight-to-cash”. Furthermore, we show that allowing for regime shifts in the factor volatilities dramatically improves the model’s fit and strengthens the level effect.
