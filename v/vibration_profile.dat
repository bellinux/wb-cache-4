50|$|Vibrating tables or shake {{tables are}} {{sometimes}} {{used to test}} products to determine or demonstrate their ability to withstand vibration. Testing of this type is commonly done in the automotive, aerospace, and defense industries. These machines are capable of producing three different types of <b>vibration</b> <b>profile</b> sine sweep, random vibration, and synthesized shock. In {{all three of these}} applications, the part under test will typically be instrumented with one or more accelerometers to measure component response to the vibration input. A sine sweep <b>vibration</b> <b>profile</b> typically starts vibrating at low frequency and increases in frequency at a set rate (measured in hertz per second or hertz per minute). The vibratory amplitude as measured in gs may increase or decrease as well. A sine sweep will find resonant frequencies in the part. A random <b>vibration</b> <b>profile</b> will excite different frequencies along a spectrum at different times. Significant calculation goes into making sure that all frequencies get excited to within an acceptable tolerance band. A random vibration test suite may range anywhere from 30 seconds up to several hours. It is intended to synthesize the effect of, for example, a car driving over rough terrain or a rocket taking off. A synthesized shock pulse is a short duration high level vibration calculated as a sum of many half-sine waves covering a range of frequencies. It is intended to simulate the effects of an impact or explosion. A shock pulse test typically lasts less than a second. Vibrating tables can also be used in the packaging process in material handling industries to shake or settle a container so it can hold more product.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{vibration}} durability {{testing methods}} for a component is conservative in verifying the fatigue {{strength of a}} component. They more of typify the damaging potential {{of the real world}} vibration, instead of the component under test. This thesis proposes a new vibration durability testing method that works by giving emphasis to the dynamic behaviour of the component. From several tests carried out at different narrow frequency bands, it develops a diagram that shows the maximum limit of a component towards vibration. Design verification will then be made by comparing the result with the real world vibration. To this aim, a test has been carried out on a truck alternator at four different frequency regions and a <b>vibration</b> <b>profile</b> has been extracted by combining them together. Then, comparing the result with the real world <b>vibration</b> <b>profile,</b> the design of the alternator has been verified. Accordingly, the alternator shows less strength at low frequency regions...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) {{is conducting a}} research program in methods of higher harmonic control (HHC) for reduction of helicopter vibrations. The program at NPS uses remotely piloted helicopters (RPH) to study HHC effects on vibration and blade load reduction. The scope of this master's thesis was to measure the baseline <b>vibration</b> <b>profile</b> of the RPH test vehicles prior to the installation of a HHC system. This goal was met {{by the development of}} a data instrumentation and recording system and by conducting a ground and flight test program for the RPH test vehicles. From the results of these tests it was concluded that: a) the data instrumentation and recording system was of sufficient sensitivity to detect vibrations experienced within the RPH airframe; and b) the RPH exhibited a <b>vibration</b> <b>profile</b> similar to that of a full scale helicopter. It is recommended that a HHC system be designed, fabricated, and installed on the RPH so that the effects of HHC on helicopter performance may be evaluated. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Many factors {{need to be}} {{considered}} when conducting whole-body vibration (WBV) risk assessments. Complications may arise with the evaluation of the <b>vibration</b> <b>profile</b> when high acceleration events are present. These peaks could be the result of a genuine exposure to high impact events, such as driving over a pothole or when experiencing an end-stop impact. However, the event could also be the result of an alternative factor, such as the driver altering their posture on the seat and during ingress/egress: an ‘artefact’. This paper presents a study conducted to characterise the events of ingress/egress of operators. Using a range of subjects with different weights and heights, repeat measurements were made in a Mini Excavator (mechanical suspension seat), Wheel Loader (air suspension seat), Volvo car (conventional seat) and office worker’s chair. Findings demonstrated that an operator could exceed the vibration dose action value of the Physical Agents (Vibration) Directive (9. 1 ms- 1. 75) by artefacts alone with no ‘authentic ’ WBV exposure. This is important to consider when carrying out autonomous logging where there is a risk that operator artefacts could be integrated with the true <b>vibration</b> <b>profile.</b> If high acceleration ingress and egress events are considered relevant to whole-body vibration risk assessments, office workers should also be included within the scope of the Physical Agents (Vibration) Directive...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to control {{vibration}} of arbitrary structures with spatially weighted objectives. Multiple discrete structural sensors are distributed over a structure and a spatial interpolation method is used to obtain the estimate of vibration at any points over the structure. The method thus {{does not require a}} priori information about the dynamic model of the structure. From the vibration information provided by structural sensors, spatial signals can then be obtained, representing the spatially weighted vibration of the entire structure. A condensation procedure allows the reduction of the required number of control input channels for active control purposes. A numerical case study of a flexible plate demonstrated that the proposed method can be used for minimising spatial vibration or for achieving a desired spatial <b>vibration</b> <b>profile</b> of a structure.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} the synthesis of compressed <b>vibration</b> test <b>profiles</b> representing much longer time histories obtained in road testing of ground vehicles. <b>Vibration</b> test <b>profiles</b> are defined as those related directly to operational testing on specific road surfaces and which summarise the input to the vehicle in the given conditions. The method extends classical Fourier transform technique by means of bump event correction in the background Fourier signal where the bump event term implies a high-amplitude transient event of the shock type. The orthogonal wavelet decomposition {{was used as a}} specific filtering tool facilitating bump event identification. Examples of seat guide vertical acceleration have been considered. Calculated probability density functions suggest the ability of the bump correction method to improve the statistical accuracy of the final <b>vibration</b> test <b>profile</b> with respect to the original road data. Test profiles obtained by means of Fourier transform synthesis with subsequent reinsertion of bump events from separated frequency bands were more accurate than those obtained by Fourier synthesis alone. Further developments led to advanced bump reinsertion with synchronisation of events occurring in different frequency bands at the same moment of time. Test profiles generated in this way have provided better accuracy compared to the non-synchronised algorithm...|$|R

The limit cycles of isolated grains are largely affected by the asymmetry of the vibration mode, increasing the size in phase space of the chaotic regions.
