Despite this progress, {{it is not uncommon}} for new products made through advanced technologies, such as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, to face public skepticism preventing market penetration. Therefore, the factors impacting customer acceptance of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have to be estimated. Furthermore, it is necessary to examine whether or not the policies related to these products can prevent public skepticism regarding them. This empirical study examining the relationship between personal experiences related to the policy and acceptance of the innovative products of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles shows that government involvement in technology targeting and promotions administered by the "low carbon, green growth" agenda rarely stimulate potential customers' purchase intentions.

This mutual interaction has been a field of research for several years and a variety of modeling approaches have been applied. This paper aims at reviewing models of combined AFV and refueling infrastructure market diffusion and pointing out research gaps.

Ten interaction models are evaluated with respect to the identified aspects. We find that simulation is the most common approach for an interaction model. Besides, the majority of the examined stylized facts is covered by the models. However, models for FCEVs could be improved by reflecting the transport of fuel to refueling infrastructure while new models on PEVs should include charging duration, frequency and charging station ownership...|$|R

40|$|Environmental and {{societal}} {{problems related to}} energy use have spurred the development of sustainable energy technologies, such as wind mills, carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen <b>vehicles.</b> Public <b>acceptance</b> of these technologies is crucial for their successful introduction into society. Although various studies have investigated technology acceptance, most technology acceptance studies focused on a limited set of factors that can influence public acceptance, and were not based on a comprehensive framework including key factors influencing technology acceptance. This paper puts forward a comprehensive framework of energy technology acceptance, based on a review of psychological theories and on empirical technology acceptance studies. The framework aims to explain the intention to act in favor or against new sustainable energy technologies, which {{is assumed to be}} influenced by attitude, social norms, perceived behavioral control, and personal norm. In the framework, attitude is influenced by the perceived costs, risks and benefits, positive and negative feelings in response to the technology, trust, procedural fairness and distributive fairness. Personal norm is influenced by perceived costs, risks and benefits, outcome efficacy and awareness of adverse consequences of not accepting the new technology. The paper concludes with discussing the applicability of the framework. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

A survey {{was designed to be}} answered via World Wide Web, throughout 3 months and only accessible to Portuguese inhabitants. The survey was composed by biographical and car ownership info, mobility patterns, awareness toward plug-in vehicle technologies, price premium and, finally, potential buyer’s attitudes regarding charging vehicles with electricity from the grid. An explanation of how each vehicle technology works {{in the case of a}} regular hybrid (HEV), a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and a pure electric vehicle (EV) was provided. A total sample of 809 volunteers answered the survey, aged above 18 years old, 50 % male and 50 % female. The results allowed the estimation of the typical daily driving distance, the Utility Factor curve for plug-in hybrid future users, the charging preferences for future users of pure electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles and the necessary feebates to promote the market penetration of such technologies. Other correlations were also analyzed between driving patterns, type of owned car, price premium and the willingness to buy pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The main policy implications are that an increase of awareness campaigns is necessary if the government intends to support the plug-in electric vehicle technology widespread and a minimum of 5000 € investment per ton of avoided CO 2 will be necessary in a year...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{reliable}} computational tools and of validated vehicle and track models allow studying the railway vehicle performance in realistic operation conditions. The {{use of such}} advanced tools permits performing the so-called virtual homologation, which means {{that most of the}} criteria defined in the standards and regulations for <b>vehicle</b> <b>acceptance</b> can be verified numerically. This approach reduces the need of the expensive and long on-track tests, and also permits performing design optimization of several vehicle components, namely, the suspension elements, to improve its operational performance in terms of running safety, ride quality and track loading. The realism of the numerical simulations depends strongly on the model assumptions. In this work, all the mechanical elements that compose the rail vehicle are modeled properly using advanced methodologies. Then, a realistic and fully three-dimensional track, containing the measured track irregularities, is used. Finally, for a realistic running representation of the vehicle in the track, a prescribed motion of the motor wheel sets is adopted to adjust the vehicle speed as function of the track characteristics, namely, its curvature, cant angle and grade. The aim of this research is to develop a methodology to optimize the design of a rail vehicle in a mountainous track based on virtual homologation procedure. For this purpose, an optimization method is used to run the numerical simulations in batch mode and the dynamic performance of the rail vehicle is quantified based on the safety and ride quality indices defined in the standards. In addition, the optimization procedure uses a penalty term that penalizes cases where the vehicle presents an unacceptable dynamic behavior. The design variables considered are the suspension characteristics. This work provides an optimal design tool for the rail vehicle performance that leads to optimal dynamic performance in terms of running safety and ride quality. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Unlike regular {{automotive}} vehicles, {{which are}} designed to travel in different types of roads, railway vehicles travel mostly in the same route during their life cycle. To accept the operation of a railway vehicle in a particular network, a homologation process is required according to local standard regulations. In Europe, the standards EN 14363 and UIC 518, which are used for railway <b>vehicle</b> <b>acceptance,</b> require on-track tests and/or numerical simulations. An important advantage of using virtual homologation is {{the reduction of the}} high costs associated with on-track tests by studying the railway vehicle performance in different operation conditions. This work proposes a methodology for the improvement of railway vehicle design with the objective of its operation in selected railway tracks by using optimisation. The analyses required for the vehicle improvement are performed under control of the optimisation method global and local optimisation using direct search. To quantify the performance of the vehicle, a new objective function is proposed, which includes: a Dynamic Performance Index, defined as a weighted sum of the indices obtained from the virtual homologation process; the non-compensated acceleration, which is related to the operational velocity; and a penalty associated with cases where the vehicle presents an unacceptable dynamic behaviour according to the standards. Thus, the optimisation process intends not only {{to improve the quality of}} the vehicle in terms of running safety and ride quality, but also to increase the vehicle availability via the reduction of the time for a journey while ensuring its operational acceptance under the standards. The design variables include the suspension characteristics and the operational velocity of the vehicle, which are allowed to vary in an acceptable range of variation. The results of the optimisation lead to a global minimum of the objective function in which the suspensions characteristics of the vehicle are optimal for the track, the maximum operational velocity is increased while the safety and ride quality measures of the vehicle, as defined by homologation standards, are either maintained in acceptable values or improved. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} are being intensively discussed {{as a possible}} sustainable and energy-efficient means of transport. Throughout Europe, broad programmes have been launched to support electric vehicle research, field trials and market diffusion. However, for a successful diffusion of electric <b>vehicles,</b> their <b>acceptance</b> by consumers is crucial. So far this issue has not been analysed sufficiently involving actual users of recent electric vehicle models. What do electric vehicle users and those intending to use an electric vehicle {{in the near future}} really think about electric vehicles? How do these perceptions change if they actually use an electric vehicle in everyday life? In order to provide answers to these questions, a longitudinal set of survey data has been analysed of participants in field trials in the eight pilot regions for electric mobility in Germany. These findings are compared to the survey data of nearly 1, 000 German car drivers classified into four groups (current electric vehicle users, non-users with a concrete purchase intention, electric vehicle-interested people and consumers with no interest in electric vehicles). The analyses and the comparison between the two studies indicate that gaining real experience with electric vehicles has a positive influence on some predictors of the <b>acceptance</b> of electric <b>vehicles</b> according to the diffusion of innovation model by Rogers (2003). This indicates the relevance of the visibility and observability of electric vehicles.

40|$|While {{much of the}} {{previous}} research relies on Federal Driving Schedules originally developed for emission certification tests of conventional <b>vehicles,</b> consumer <b>acceptance</b> and market penetration will depend on PHEV performance under realistic driving conditions. Therefore, characterizing the actual driving is essential for PHEV design and control studies, and for establishing realistic forecasts pertaining to vehicle energy consumption and charging requirements. To achieve this goal, we analyze naturalistic driving data generated in Field Operational Tests (FOT) of passenger vehicles in Southeast Michigan. The FOT were originally conceived for evaluating driver interaction with advanced safety systems, but the databases are rich with information pertaining to vehicle energy. After the initial statistical analysis of the vehicle speed histories, the naturalistic driving schedules are used as input to the PHEV computer simulation to predict energy usage {{as a function of}} trip length. The highest specific energy, i. e. energy per mile, is critical for battery and motor sizing. As an illustration of the impact of actual driving, the low-energy and high-energy driving patterns would require PHEV 20 battery sizes of 6. 12 kWh and 13. 6 kWh, respectively. This is determined assuming that the minimum state of charge (SOC) is 40. In addition, the naturalistic driving databases are mined for information about vehicle resting time, i. e. time spent at typical locations during the 24 -hour period. The locations include "home", "work", "large-business" such as a large retail store, and "small business", such as a gas station, and finally "residential" other than home. The characterization of vehicle daily missions supports analysis of charging schedules, as it indicates times spent at given locate ons as well as the likely battery SOC at the time of arrival.

The descriptions of these therapies are offered (a) {{to illustrate how}} intensive, in-depth psychotherapies {{can be derived from}} radical behaviorism, and (6) to circumvent the frequent misunderstandings that characterize the discus-sions between behavior analysts and their critics. The nature of ACT and FAP methods appears to dispel many common myths about contemporary behavior analysis. When we asked several of our colleagues what came to mind in response to the terms Skinnerian psychotherapy and radical behaviorism, their responses included “simplistic, ” “rigid,” “mechanistic, ” “controlling, ” “manipulative, ” “chauvinistic, ” “devoid of emotion and sensi-tivity, n “ignores the unconscious, ” “doesn’t foster creativity, ” “assigns no role to self or sense of self, ” “ confined to behavior common to people and animals, ” “ignores the impor-tance of the client-therapist relationship, ” u ignores feelings and thoughts, ” “deals only with what can be seen publicly. ” All of these conceptions are false. Radical behaviorists have often complained claimed that behavior analysis is easily misunderstood (e. g., Catania, 1991; Morris, 1990). Unfortunately, when debates an...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1985 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaCommand Destruct Receivers {{are used}} on all launch {{vehicles}} {{for the purpose}} of initiating flight termination. The up-link command signal is a UHF carrier frequency modulated with Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) audio tones. Typically three commands are used to control and terminate the flight: ARM, DESTRUCT, and OPTIONAL command. The combination and sequence of specified IRIG tones determines the command to be issued. The decoder portion of the command destruct receiver determines the presence and sequence of IRIG tones. Through the use of a microprocessor and digital signalprocessing-technology, Cincinnati Electronics has designed and developed a digital decoder which detects four IRIG tones simultaneously. The digital decoder provides stabilities and repeatabilities unattainable with analog decoders. Reliability and reproducibility are also superior when using the digital approach through the elimination of select and variable components. This improved performance of the decoder is a result of crystal controlled digital filtering and a constant false-alarm rate provided by the microprocessor. The digital filtering is achieved through Finite Impulse Response digital filters. There are a number of additional features provided by the digital decoder. Self-testing of portions of the receiver and correcting for temperature drift can be performed by the decoder. The digital decoder can have its command sequences reprogrammed in the field allowing separate control and termination of each vehicle in a multiple <b>vehicle</b> launch. Also, <b>acceptance</b> test data, date of manufacture, total time unit has been powered up, and other data can be stored inside the Command Destruct Receiver and recalled when needed...|$|R
40|$|Vehicle to Grid (V 2 G) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as an alternative way {{to cope with the}} electricity demands of the future by integrating the electric and transportation system infrastructures. In this way, the vehicle fleet will be used as a mobile storage system, enabling a higher penetration level for renewable energy sources. As an example, with the current personal transportation fleet of Europe, 2, 390 GW of electric capacity could be fed into the grid. Currently, V 2 G is in the Research and Development stage and several institutions around the world are testing its capabilities in pilot projects. The Car as Power Plant (CaPP) concept {{emerged as one of the}} projects from The Green Village, which is an initiative of Delft University of Technology. Similar to the V 2 G technology, the Car as Power Plant's main aim is to deliver electricity to the grid. However, there are significant differences among them. In the case of the CaPP it uses Fuel Cell Vehicles to generate not only electricity but also water and heat. Therefore, the CaPP concept can be considered as a small multi-product power plant. There are additional elements that make the CaPP concept not only a way to deliver electricity to the grid, but a whole paradigm shift by using our cars to replace the electric system. The focus of this report is precisely in this technological concept. In the past, the studies about the CaPP concept have concentrated mainly on the technical feasibility and economic estimations of the project. One of the studies examined the technological gaps and opportunities for the CaPP, while the other assessed the ancillary services delivered to the grid by the Fuel Cell vehicles. Nevertheless, the technology evolves and emerges into society as a technological system due to the alignment of several socio-technical factors. Some of these include user practices, market conditions, consumer perceptions or a merely functional basis. For this reason, it is relevant to go one step further and not only understand the technical conditions of the system, but also the perceived benefits and concerns by the potential users. On this way it would be possible to incorporate into the Research and Development stage some elements that could be of interest for society, to ease the adoption of the technology in the future. The objective of this study is to bridge the gap between the technology development and the society's perception by assessing the <b>vehicle</b> technology <b>acceptance</b> and its implications for the business model design in the Netherlands. A model extended from the Car Technology Acceptance Model is proposed to conduct the study. This model is formed by eight independent, three moderating and one dependant variables. To have a better impression about the user's context, mixed research methods are employed. The application is done by individual in-depth structured interviews as the preferred data collection method with a reduced amount of participants. The sample comprises 20 participants, classified in 3 groups: 1) Students that do not own a car, 2) Professionals who own an internal combustion based car, and 3) Persons who own and electric based cars. From the total participants, 7 are students, 8 are gasoline car owners, and 5 are electric car drivers. Considering two different measurements instruments are used, the data analysis follows the same structure. The quantitative instrument uses descriptive statistics and then a correlation analysis using the SPSS software. The qualitative data is analysed using content analysis by grouping information together into category clusters and then comparing it with the group of participants. The results show the technology acceptance levels about the CaPP concept are in general above average, this is true in both the quantitative and qualitative sections. The most relevant factors to foster the technology adoption are grouped in 6 categories: price, incentives, information access, infrastructure, technology and values. The perceived benefits are classified in two categories: for the user and for society. The benefits for the user include: monetary incentives, guilt reduction, and increase in consumer power. The benefits for society are: environmental benefits, integration of services, and reducing the variation from renewable sources. The concerns are classified in two: car technology and the system. The concerns identified about car technology are: dangers of using hydrogen, degradation of the Fuel Cell, and lack of flexibility when the car is plugged-in. On the system side the concerns are: the lack of infrastructure, long distances from CaPP facilities to the final destination, and the risks involved in decentralizing the power generation. The semi-lease is determined to be the best business model structure to adopt the CaPP as it transfers the associated risks from the users to the provider and keeps the customer as the proprietary of the vehicle. Some of the policy recommendations to develop the niche include: continue funding the Fuel Cells R&D related activities, define an annual amount of energy that should be delivered to the grid with the CaPP technology, incentivize an open innovation scheme where different industry, governmental and academia actors come together under a joint venture to develop the technology, unify the development of the communication standards being used in the V 2 G projects around the world as they may influence the ones to be adopted in the future for the CaPP.
