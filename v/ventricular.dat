5|$|Cardiac, <b>ventricular</b> RLC is an 18.8 kDa protein {{composed}} of 166 amino acids.|$|E
5|$|People {{with poor}} {{clinical}} grade on admission, acute neurologic deterioration, or progressive enlargement of ventricles on CT scan are, in general, indications for {{the placement of}} an external <b>ventricular</b> drain by a neurosurgeon. The external <b>ventricular</b> drain may be inserted at the bedside or in the operating room. In either case, strict aseptic technique must be maintained during insertion. In people with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage the EVD is used to remove cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and blood byproducts that increase intracranial pressure and may increase the risk for cerebral vasospasm.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ventricular</b> myosin light chain-2 (MLC-2v) {{refers to}} the <b>ventricular</b> cardiac muscle form of myosin light chain 2 (Myl2). MLC-2v is a 19-KDa protein {{composed}} of 166 amino acids, that belongs to the EF-hand Ca2+ binding superfamily. MLC-2v interacts with the neck/tail region of the muscle thick filament protein myosin to regulate myosin motility and function.|$|E
25|$|Chest X-ray {{can assist}} in making the diagnosis, showing left <b>ventricular</b> {{hypertrophy}} and dilated aorta. ECG typically indicates left <b>ventricular</b> hypertrophy. Cardiac chamber catheterization assists in assessing the severity of regurgitation and any left <b>ventricular</b> dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Idiopathic <b>ventricular</b> {{fibrillation}} {{occurs with}} a reputed incidence of approximately 1% {{of all cases}} of out-of-hospital arrest, as well as 3%-9% of the cases of <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation unrelated to myocardial infarction, and 14% of all <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation resuscitations in patients {{under the age of}} 40. It follows then that, {{on the basis of the}} fact that <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation itself is common, idiopathic <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation accounts for an appreciable mortality. Recently described syndromes such as the Brugada Syndrome may give clues to the underlying mechanism of <b>ventricular</b> arrhythmias. In the Brugada syndrome, changes may be found in the resting ECG with evidence of right bundle branch block (RBBB) and ST elevation in the chest leads V1-V3, with an underlying propensity to sudden cardiac death.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ventricular</b> {{fibrillation}} {{most commonly}} occurs within diseased hearts, and, {{in the vast}} majority of cases, is a manifestation of underlying ischemic heart disease. <b>Ventricular</b> fibrillation is also seen in those with cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and other heart pathologies. In addition, it is seen with electrolyte imbalance, overdoses of cardiotoxic drugs, and following near drowning or major trauma. It is also notable that <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation occurs where there is no discernible heart pathology or other evident cause, the so-called idiopathic <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|Defibrillation is the {{treatment}} of choice for <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation (VF) and <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia resulting in cardiac arrest. However, amiodarone {{has been used in}} shock-refractory VF. The 2010 guidelines of the American Heart Association included amiodarone as a second line agent (after epinephrine or vasopressin). They believed that amiodarone was more effective than lidocaine in VF or pulseless <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes devices {{resembling}} pacemakers, called implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are implanted. These {{devices are}} often used {{in the treatment of}} patients at risk from sudden cardiac death. An ICD has the ability to treat many types of heart rhythm disturbances by means of pacing, cardioversion, or defibrillation. Some ICD devices can distinguish between <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation and <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia (VT), and may try to pace the heart faster than its intrinsic rate in the case of VT, to try to break the tachycardia before it progresses to <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation. This is known as fast-pacing, overdrive pacing, or anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP). ATP is only effective if the underlying rhythm is <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia, and is never effective if the rhythm is <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|Normally, the heart’s {{pacemaker}} {{regulates the}} contraction of the heart’s ventricles. <b>Ventricular</b> fibrillation and <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia occur {{when there are}} irregularities in the electrical signals from the pacemaker, causing the heart’s ventricles to contract abnormally and preventing blood from circulating throughout the body. <b>Ventricular</b> fibrillation and tachycardia can lead to sudden cardiac death if not treated immediately.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ventricular</b> {{fibrillation}} (V-fib or VF) is {{when the}} heart quivers instead of pumping due to disorganized electrical activity in the ventricles. It {{is a type of}} cardiac arrhythmia. <b>Ventricular</b> fibrillation results in cardiac arrest with loss of consciousness and no pulse. This is followed by death in the absence of treatment. <b>Ventricular</b> fibrillation is found initially in about 10% of people in cardiac arrest.|$|E
25|$|Some squamate species (e.g., pythons {{and monitor}} lizards) have three-chambered hearts that become {{functionally}} four-chambered hearts during contraction. This {{is made possible}} by a muscular ridge that subdivides the ventricle during <b>ventricular</b> diastole and completely divides it during <b>ventricular</b> systole. Because of this ridge, some of these squamates are capable of producing <b>ventricular</b> pressure differentials that are equivalent to those seen in mammalian and avian hearts.|$|E
25|$|Hypertensive {{heart disease}} {{is the result of}} {{structural}} and functional adaptations leading to left <b>ventricular</b> hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, CHF, abnormalities of blood flow due to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and microvascular disease, and cardiac arrhythmias. Individuals with left <b>ventricular</b> hypertrophy are at increased risk for, stroke, CHF, and sudden death. Aggressive control of hypertension can regress or reverse left <b>ventricular</b> hypertrophy and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|Defibrillation is the {{definitive}} {{treatment for the}} life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation and <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia. Defibrillation consists of delivering a therapeutic dose of electrical energy to the affected heart. Dr. Claude Beck invented the defibrillator in 1947.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also some}} vagal {{innervation}} of the atrial muscle, {{and to a}} much lesser extent, the <b>ventricular</b> muscle. Vagus activation, therefore, results in modest reductions in atrial contractility (inotropy) and even smaller decreases in <b>ventricular</b> contractility.|$|E
25|$|Antiarrhythmic agents, {{also known}} as cardiac {{dysrhythmia}} medications, are a group of pharmaceuticals {{that are used to}} suppress abnormal rhythms of the heart (cardiac arrhythmias), such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia, and <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|The QRS complex {{represents}} <b>ventricular</b> depolarization.|$|E
25|$|The T wave {{represents}} <b>ventricular</b> repolarization.|$|E
25|$|The loss of {{physiologic}} {{timing of}} atrial and <b>ventricular</b> contractions, or sometimes called AV dyssynchrony, leads to different mechanisms of symptoms production. This altered <b>ventricular</b> contraction will decrease cardiac output, {{and in turn}} will lead to systemic hypotensive reflex response with varying symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Vasopressin is used {{to manage}} anti-diuretic hormone deficiency. It has off-label uses and {{is used in the}} {{treatment}} of vasodilatory shock, gastrointestinal bleeding, <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia and <b>ventricular</b> defibrillation. Vasopressin {{is used to}} treat diabetes insipidus related to low levels of antiduretic hormone.It is available as Pressyn.|$|E
25|$|Brain imaging has {{documented}} cerebral atrophy, {{which is a}} loss of neurons {{in the brain and}} the connections between them. Also documented were problems with the <b>ventricular</b> system in the brain, such as <b>ventricular</b> asymmetry and <b>ventricular</b> enlargement. Hydrocephalus has also been noted in children with 1p36 deletion syndrome. This is basically too much fluid within the brain. Hyperreflexia, which is defined as overactive or overresponsive reflexes in the body, was also found to be common. Many children also have epilepsy which is a disorder of the brain that results in recurrent, unprovoked seizures.|$|E
25|$|In general, a {{non-invasive}} transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) {{is performed}} in newly diagnosed AF, {{as well as}} if there is a major change in the patient's clinical state. This ultrasound-based scan of the heart may help identify valvular heart disease (which may greatly increase the risk of stroke), left and right atrial size (which indicates likelihood that AF may become permanent), left <b>ventricular</b> size and function, peak right <b>ventricular</b> pressure (pulmonary hypertension), presence of left atrial thrombus (low sensitivity), presence of left <b>ventricular</b> hypertrophy and pericardial disease.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ventricular</b> {{system is}} a set of four {{interconnected}} cavities (ventricles) in the brain, where the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced. Within each ventricle is a region of choroid plexus, a network of ependymal cells involved in the production of CSF. The <b>ventricular</b> system is continuous with the central canal of the spinal cord (from the fourth ventricle) allowing for the flow of CSF to circulate. All of the <b>ventricular</b> system and the central canal of the spinal cord are lined with ependyma, a specialised form of epithelium.|$|E
25|$|The {{cellular}} {{mechanisms of}} commotio cordis are still poorly understood, but probably {{related to the}} activation of mechanosensitive proteins, ion channels. These trigger extra electrical excitation waves which, if occurring right at {{the trailing edge of}} a previous electrical cycle, can give rise to <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation. Since the trailing edge of the preceding electrical cycle travels over the <b>ventricular</b> surface, the critical window for mechanical induction of <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation varies locally - i.e. the commotio cordis risk window exists in time and in space. This helps to explain why precordial impacts tend to have benign consequences.|$|E
25|$|The {{downstream}} effector of Notch signaling, HEY2, {{was also}} demonstrated {{to be important}} in regulating <b>ventricular</b> development by its expression in the interventricular septum and the endocardial cells of the cardiac cushions. Cardiomyocyte and smooth muscle cell-specific deletion of HEY2 results in impaired cardiac contractility, malformed right ventricle, and <b>ventricular</b> septal defects.|$|E
25|$|Dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} (DCM) is {{a disease}} of heart muscle resulting in decreased myocardial contractility. The left ventricle compensates for this disease by growing larger (eccentric or volume overload hypertrophy; AKA dilation). The left atrial is also dilated when the disease is severe. It is seen in large/giant dog breeds such as Boxers, Great Danes, and Doberman Pinschers. It is usually idiopathic, but can also be caused by taurine deficiency in American Cocker Spaniels or doxorubicin use. A mutation in the gene that encodes for pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 is associated with DCM in Doberman Pinschers in the USA. Dilated cardiomyopathy usually ultimately results in congestive heart failure. Atrial fibrillation is common in giant breed dogs with DCM. Doberman Pinschers more commonly have <b>ventricular</b> arrhythmias (e.g., premature <b>ventricular</b> complexes; <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia) that predispose them to sudden death (i.e., <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation).|$|E
25|$|Arrhythmogenic right <b>ventricular</b> {{cardiomyopathy}} (ARVC), {{mutations in}} the DES gene.|$|E
25|$|Spontaneous {{conversion}} of <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation {{to a more}} benign rhythm is rare in all but small animals. Defibrillation is the process that converts <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation to a more benign rhythm. This is usually by application of an electric shock to the myocardium and is discussed in detail in the relevant article.|$|E
25|$|QRS {{complexes}} {{should be}} narrow, signifying {{that they are}} initiated by normal conduction of atrial electrical activity through the intraventricular conduction system. Wide QRS complexes are worrisome for <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia, although, in cases {{where there is a}} disease of the conduction system, wide complexes may be present in A-Fib with rapid <b>ventricular</b> response.|$|E
25|$|Brugada {{syndrome}} is another <b>ventricular</b> arrhythmia caused by voltage-gated sodium channel gene mutations.|$|E
25|$|Cardiovascular {{features}} {{may include}} hypertension, {{and heart rate}} that may be rapid or irregular in character; these {{may be perceived as}} palpitations. Less common findings include left <b>ventricular</b> hypertrophy, premature atrial and <b>ventricular</b> contractions, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, systemic embolization, death from cardiovascular collapse and resistance to some drug effects (digoxin, coumadin).|$|E
25|$|Results of {{a medical}} study known as the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) {{demonstrated}} that patients with structural heart disease (such as a history of MI (heart attack), or left <b>ventricular</b> dysfunction) and also patients with <b>ventricular</b> arrhythmias, should not take this drug. The results were so significant that the trial was stopped early and preliminary results were published.|$|E
25|$|Electrocardiogram {{may show}} {{evidence}} of <b>ventricular</b> dysfunction or, occasionally, arrhythmia due to myocarditis.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} {{and shape of}} the <b>ventricular</b> system relates to the differential development of different parts of the brain, with the <b>ventricular</b> system ultimately arising from the neural tube. The lateral ventricles remain connected to the third ventricle throughout development, themselves developing as outpouchings from the third ventricle. The foramina develop slowly in a forward and outward direction as the fornix grows in size.|$|E
25|$|In mice, mERG and KCNQ1, another Kv α subunit {{regulated}} by KCNE2, are neither influential nor highly expressed in adult ventricles. However, Kcne2-/- mice exhibit QT prolongation at baseline at 7 months of age, or earlier if provoked with a QT-prolonging agent such as sevoflurane. This is because KCNE2 is a promiscuous regulatory subunit that forms complexes with Kv1.5 and with Kv4.2 in adult mouse <b>ventricular</b> myocytes. KCNE2 increases currents though Kv4.2 channels and slows their inactivation. KCNE2 {{is required for}} Kv1.5 to localize to the intercalated discs of mouse <b>ventricular</b> myocytes. Kcne2 deletion in mice reduces the native currents generated in <b>ventricular</b> myocytes by Kv4.2 and Kv1.5, namely Ito and IKslow, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Amiodarone is an {{antiarrhythmic}} medication used {{to treat}} and prevent a number of types of irregular heartbeats. This includes <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia (VT), <b>ventricular</b> fibrillation (VF), and wide complex tachycardia, as well as atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. It can be given by mouth, intravenously, or intraosseously. When used by mouth, it can take a few weeks for effects to begin.|$|E
25|$|Tetralogy of Fallot* is a {{congenital}} heart {{defect in}} dogs that includes four separate defects: pulmonic stenosis, a <b>ventricular</b> septal defect, right <b>ventricular</b> hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta. Keeshonds and Bulldogs are predisposed. Signs include cyanosis and exercise intolerance. Polycythemia is often present and, if severe, {{needs to be}} controlled with phlebotomy or drugs to suppress red blood cell production.|$|E
