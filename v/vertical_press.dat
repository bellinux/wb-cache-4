Due {{to the process}} complexity (the presence of forces on three directions—a vertical one and two in the blank's plane), a three axes CNC milling machine, capable of describing the complex paths covered by the punch for obtaining the truncated cone-shaped parts, has been chosen. To obtain a truncated cone, three different trajectories were selected: in first and second variants after each <b>vertical</b> <b>press</b> having a constant step, the punch covers a circular path. The differences show that the following circular trajectory can start {{at the same point}} or can be shifted at an angle of 90 ° from the previous press point.

The {{paper is}} devoted to the study and {{evaluation}} of residual life for defective rails P 50 operated on the roads of the Kyiv subway, which are taken out of service because of defects 11. 1 - 2 {{on the side of the}} rolling surface of the rail head. Methodology. The studies were performed with the use of experimental methods: testing of samples of defective rails in the cyclical strength of the pulse machine and testing of defective rails in the static load limit on the hydraulic <b>vertical</b> <b>press.</b> Findings. The performed experiments indicate that on the tests basis in 2 million cycles is only a small development (increase in size) 0. 5 - 0. 7 mm of existing code defects 11. 2 as a result of shedding the particles of crumble out metal on the side of the rails head of working prototypes. The intensity and the catastrophic development of defects, such as 11. 2, or transformation of these defects in defects such as 21. 2 or 30 G. 2 did not happen in any case. Originality. For the first time in Ukraine with the theoretical calculations substantiated the greater possibility of defects formation of contact fatigue origin in the form of spall and jag of metal on the surface of the rail, at the edge of the head. It is the result of the creation of a high degree of stress nonequilibrium compression in this area, due to the high values of principal normal stresses and appearance of large shear stresses in the body of the head at a depth of 2. 5 - 3. 5 mm, exceeding the yield strength and metal endurance. The tests of experimental prototypes of defective rails on high cycle endurance (based № = 2, 1 h 10 cycles) with periodic defectoscopic control were conducted. Practical value. In experiments, the new data of the resistance ability to spall rail defects on the surface of the head of rolling on the code 11. 1 - 2 long-term cyclic loading equal to operational magnitude at the wheel load test of 2 million cycles was obtained. That is, the defective rails can have residual life of not less than 30 million. t. gross. ...|$|E
