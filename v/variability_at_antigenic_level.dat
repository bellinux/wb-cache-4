40|$|Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) is {{widespread}} both in dairy and beef cattle throughout the world. The virus {{is one of}} the largest RNA virus and has specific tropism for intestinal and pulmonary epithelial cells. It is responsible for huge economic losses by causing winter dysentery in adult dairy cattle and respiratory and intestinal tract infections leading to pneumo-enteritis in young calves. Isolation of BCoV has been reported to be difficult. Studies regarding epidemiology, virus isolation and molecular detection from India are very few. In the present study Vero cell line was used for isolation of the BCoV from Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) positive samples. Direct florescent antibody technique (dFAT) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to confirm the isolated virus strains <b>at</b> <b>antigenic</b> and genomic <b>levels,</b> respectively. Out of the 15 positive fecal samples, virus from only seven was able to infect vero cell line. Subsequently BCoV got adapted to the vero cell line upto three passages, which was confirmed both <b>at</b> genomic and <b>antigenic</b> <b>levels</b> by dFAT and RT-PCR testing. It can be concluded that vero cell line can be used for isolation of BCoV, however due to the enormous stain diversity of the virus it is possible that many stains can’t grow and get adapt in this cell line. Further studies are required for isolation of different viral strains, finding the susceptible cell lines and also to confirm the variations among the BCoV isolates at antigenic/genomic levels...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{glycosylation}} alteration {{is typically}} employed by various viruses for escaping immune pressures from their hosts. Our previous work {{had shown that}} not only the increase of glycosylation sites (glycosites) numbers, but also glycosite migration might {{be involved in the}} evolution of human seasonal influenza H 1 N 1 viruses. More importantly, glycosite migration was likely a more effectively alteration way for the host adaption of human influenza H 1 N 1 viruses. In this study, we provided more bioinformatics and statistic evidences for further predicting the significant biological functions of glycosite migration in the host adaptation of human influenza H 1 N 1 viruses, by employing homology modeling and in silico protein glycosylation of representative HA and NA proteins as well as amino acid <b>variability</b> analysis <b>at</b> <b>antigenic</b> sites of HA and NA. The results showed that glycosite migrations in human influenza viruses have at least five possible functions: to more effectively mask the antigenic sites, to more effectively protect the enzymatic cleavage sites of neuraminidase (NA), to stabilize the polymeric structures, to regulate the receptor binding and catalytic activities and to balance the binding activity of hemagglutinin (HA) with the release activity of NA. The information here can provide some constructive suggestions for the function research related to protein glycosylation of influenza viruses, although these predictions stil...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} human {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA) mismatch after reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (RIT) using unrelated donors (UD) is unclear, and may be modulated by T-cell depletion. We therefore examined outcomes of 157 consecutive patients undergoing RIT after uniform conditioning with fludarabine, melphalan, and alemtuzumab (FMC). Donors were 10 / 10 HLA-matched (MUDs, n = 107) and 6 to 9 / 10 HLA-matched (MMUDs, n = 50), with {{no significant differences in}} baseline characteristics other than increased cytomegalovirus seropositivity in MMUDs. Rates of durable engraftment were high. Graft failure rates (persistent cytopenias with donor chimerism) were similar (8 % vs 3 %, P =. 21), though rejection (recipient chimerism) was more frequent in MMUDs (8 % vs 0 %, P <. 01). There {{were no significant differences between}} donors in the incidences of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; 20 % vs 22 % grade 2 - 4, respectively, P =. 83), chronic extensive GVHD (3 -year cumulative incidence [CI] 23 % vs 24 %, P =. 56), or treatment-related mortality (1 -year CI 27 % vs 27 %, P =. 96). Furthermore, there was no difference in 3 -year overall survival (OS; 53 % vs 49 %, P =. 44). Mismatch occurred <b>at</b> the <b>antigenic</b> <b>level</b> in 40 cases.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Clinical and {{experimental}} {{evidence suggests that}} extravascular fibrin deposition in arthritic joints is prominent and deleterious. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the contributions of tissue factor (TF) and its inhibitor, TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI), in arthritis. METHODS: Synovial tissue specimens obtained from 10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 12 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) were scored histologically for inflammation and fibrin content. TF and TFPI <b>levels</b> were assayed <b>at</b> <b>antigenic</b> and functional <b>levels.</b> TF messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were determined using RNase protection assays. The effect of TF inhibition in murine antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) was assessed by administering systemically active site-blocked activated factor VIIa (FVIIai). RESULTS: Functional TF activity was significantly increased in synovial membranes from RA patients compared with those from OA patients. In contrast, no difference in TF mRNA and TF <b>antigenic</b> <b>levels</b> was observed between these 2 groups. This discrepancy can be accounted for by TFPI, because we observed a negative correlation between TF activity and TFPI activity. There was a significant difference between the RA and OA groups in terms of synovial inflammation, with more inflammation observed in the RA group. Most importantly, TF activity was associated with fibrin (P = 0. 024) and with histologic inflammation (P = 0. 03) scores. In AIA, inhibition of TF-induced coagulation by FVIIai led, on day 9 of arthritis, to decreased synovial thickness and decreased articular cartilage damage, although only the latter difference between controls and treated mice reached significance (P < 0. 04). Finally, in FVIIai-treated mice, there was a strong negative association between the prothrombin time and intraarticular fibrin deposition. CONCLUSION: Our results show that TF expression in arthritic synovial tissue favors extravascular coagulation and may play a role in inflammation in RA. In this context, TF inhibitors may be of therapeutic value...|$|R
40|$|Heligmosomoides polygyrus is {{a widely}} used {{gastrointestinal}} helminth model of long-term chronic infection in mice, {{which has not been}} well-characterized <b>at</b> the <b>antigenic</b> <b>level.</b> We now identify the major targets of the murine primary Ab response as a subset of the secreted products in H. polygyrus excretory–secretory (HES) Ag. An immunodominant epitope is an O-linked glycan (named glycan A) carried on three highly expressed HES glycoproteins (venom allergen Ancylostoma-secreted protein-like [VAL]- 1, - 2, and - 5), which stimulates only IgM Abs, is exposed on the adult worm surface, and is poorly represented in somatic parasite extracts. A second carbohydrate epitope (glycan B), present on both a non-protein high molecular mass component and a 65 -kDa molecule, is widely distributed in adult somatic tissues. Whereas the high molecular mass component and 65 -kDa molecules bear phosphorylcholine, the glycan B epitope itself is not phosphorylcholine. Class-switched IgG 1 Abs are found to glycan B, but the dominant primary IgG 1 response is to the polypeptides of VAL proteins, including also VAL- 3 and VAL- 4. Secondary Ab responses include the same specificities while also recognizing VAL- 7. Although vaccination with HES conferred complete protection against challenge H. polygyrus infection, mAbs raised against each of the glycan epitopes and against VAL- 1, VAL- 2, and VAL- 4 proteins were unable to do so, even though these specificities (with the exception of VAL- 2) are also secreted by tissue-phase L 4 larvae. The primary immune response in susceptible mice is, therefore, dominated by nonprotective Abs against a small subset of antigenic epitopes, raising the possibility that these act as decoy specificities that generate ineffective humoral immunity...|$|R

Widespread and year-round circu-lation of at least four stable lineages of porcine influenza viruses between 2009 and 2012 in a region of Germany with a high-den-sity swine population is documented here. European avian influenza virus-derived H 1 N 1 (H 1 N 1 av) viruses dominated the epi-demiology, followed by human-derived subtypes H 1 N 2 and H 3 N 2. H 1 N 1 pdm viruses and, in particular, recently emerging reassortants between H 1 N 1 pdm and porcine HxN 2 viruses (H 1 pdmN 2) were detected in about 8 % of cases. Further reassortants between these main lineages were diagnosed sporadically. Ongoing diversification both at the phylogenetic and <b>at</b> the <b>antigenic</b> <b>level</b> was evident for the H 1 N 1 av lineage and for some of its reassortants. The H 1 avN 2 reassortant R 1931 / 11 displayed conspicu-ously distinct genetic and antigenic features and was easily transmitted from pig to pig in an experimental infection. Continuing diverging evolution was also observed in the H 1 pdmN 2 lineage. These viruses carry seven genome segments of the H 1 N 1 pdm virus, including a hemagglutinin gene that encodes a markedly antigenically altered protein. The zoonotic potential of this lin-eage remains to be determined. The results highlight the relevance of surveillance and control of porcine influenza virus infec-tions. This is important for the health status of swine herds. In addition, a more exhaustive tracing of the formation, transmis-sion, and spread of new reassortant influenza A viruses with unknown zoonotic potential is urgently required.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of the two isotypes of tbpB {{in a collection of}} 108 serogroup B meningococcal strains belonging to the four major clonal groups associated with epidemic and hyperendemic disease (the ET- 37 complex, the ET- 5 complex, lineage III, and cluster A 4) was determined. Isotype I strains (with a 1. 8 -kb tbpB gene) was less represented than isotype II strains (19. 4 versus 80. 6 %). Isotype I was restricted to the ET- 37 complex strains, while isotype II was found in all four clonal complexes. The extent of the allelic diversity of tbpB in these two groups was studied by PCR restriction analysis and sequencing of 10 new tbpB genes. Four major tbpB gene variants were characterized: B 16 B 6 (representative of isotype I) and M 982, BZ 83, and 8680 (representative of isotype II). The relevance of these variants was assessed <b>at</b> the <b>antigenic</b> <b>level</b> by the determination of cross-bactericidal activity of purified immunoglobulin G preparations raised to the corresponding recombinant TbpB (rTbpB) protein against a panel of 27 strains (5 of isotype I and 22 of isotype II). The results indicated that rTbpB corresponding to each variant was able to induce cross-bactericidal antibodies. However, the number of strains killed with an anti-rTbpB serum was slightly lower than that obtained with an anti-TbpA+B complex. None of the sera tested raised against an isotype I strain was able to kill an isotype II strain and vice versa. None of the specific antisera tested (anti-rTbpB or anti-TbpA+B complex) was able to kill all of the 22 isotype II strains tested. Moreover, using sera raised against the C-terminus domain of TbpB M 982 (amino acids 352 to 691) or BZ 83 (amino acids 329 to 669) fused to the maltose-binding protein, cross-bactericidal activity was detected against 12 and 7 isotype II strains, respectively, of the 22 tested. These results suggest surface accessibility of the C-terminal end of TbpB. Altogether, these results show that although more than one rTbpB will be required in the composition of a TbpB-based vaccine to achieve a fully cross-bactericidal activity, rTbpB and its C terminus were able by themselves to induce cross-bactericidal antibodies...|$|R

METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes were studied by a high sensitivity flow cytometry technique using monoclonal antibodies directed against CD 25 (IL- 2 R alpha chain), CD 122 (IL- 2 R beta chain), CD 124 (IL- 4 R), and CD 126 (IL- 6 R). SLE disease activity was scored using the SLE Disease Activity Index, C 3 and C 4 concentrations, anti-dsDNA level, and absolute lymphocyte count. RESULTS: Compared with normal controls, PBL from patients with SLE had {{a higher percentage of}} CD 25 + cells (median 20. 8 % v 16. 5 %) and a lower percentage of CD 122 + cells (median 13. 1 % v 22. 4 %). The difference in CD 122 + cells was greater in the CD 122 weak population than the CD 122 strong (natural killer cell) population. The percentages of CD 124 + and CD 126 + PBLs in patients with SLE and controls were similar. On CD 25 + cells, the relative <b>antigenic</b> <b>level</b> of the IL- 2 R alpha chain was significantly higher in patients with SLE (median 2. 01 v 1. 81).

To resolve controversies on whether only a few or many residue sites of HA 1 have undergone positive selection, whether positive selection at HA 1 is continual or punctuated, and whether antigenic change is punctuated, we introduce an approach to analyze 2, 248 HA 1 sequences collected from 1968 to 2005. We identify 95 substitutions at 63 sites from 1968 to 2005 and show that each substitution occurred very rapidly.

Settlement panels were deployed in relatively ‘pristine’ subtidal habitats off southwest Australia, to examine spatial variability in assemblage structure at multiple spatial scales, from centimetres to 100 s of kilometres. Panel assemblages were harvested after 3, 9 and 14 months of maturation, to test the following hypotheses: (i) that the magnitude of <b>variability</b> <b>at</b> large spatial scales increases with assemblage development time, (ii) that <b>variability</b> <b>at</b> the smallest spatial scales is consistently high regardless of assemblage development time, and (iii) that patterns of spatio-temporal variability differ between taxa.

40|$|High-resolution density {{profiles}} of 16 firn cores from Greenland and Antarctica are investigated {{in order to}} improve the understanding of densification of layered polar firn. A resolution of 1 to 5 mm enables us to study the detailed densification processes and the evolution of the layering and the resulting variability in density with increasing depth. The densification of layered firn is important for the process of air enclosure in the ice and is connected with the observed formation of a non-diffusive zone. We find that (1) mean density profiles, obtained from high-resolution measurements, do only partly or not show clear transitions in densification rate at densities of 550, 730 or 820 - 840 kg/m^ 3, as they are commonly proposed in literature. (2) The density variability, induced by the layering, shows a similar pattern at all sites: High <b>variabilities</b> <b>at</b> the surface, a rapid drop to a relative minimum at mean density of 600 - 650 kg/m^ 3, followed by a second relative maximum. (3) This leads to increased <b>variabilities</b> <b>at</b> densities of the firn-ice transition for most of the sites. (4) The <b>variability</b> <b>at</b> the surface does decrease with increasing annual mean temperature and accumulation rate, whereas the <b>variability</b> <b>at</b> the firn-ice transition increases.

Alternatively, synthetic methods {{for the construction}} of 13 -anomeric analogues of the TN and T-antigen glycopeptides were developed, aiming <b>at</b> <b>antigenic</b> structures having a varied stereochemistry of the linkage between the carbohydrate and the peptide moiety. As a further type of potential tumor-associated antigen, fucosyl-chitobiose asparagine glycopeptides were synthesized, deprotected, and coupled to bovine serum albumin. The chemical methods developed now make the complex sensitive glycoprotein partial structures accessible in analytically pure form and in preparative amounts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Software Product Lines (SPLs) {{encompass}} {{a family}} of software-intensive systems developed from reusable assets. One major issue during SPL development is the decision about which technique {{should be used to}} implement variabilities. Although Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) has been used to this purpose, we still need to identify in which situations it is suitable or not. We propose a catalog of <b>variabilities</b> <b>at</b> the source code level and a set of patterns for implementing them. After analyzing these patterns, we concluded that AOP is not the best technique to implement some kinds of variabilities from our cata-log. We argue that our approach is useful to find the most suitable techniques to handle specific <b>variabilities</b> <b>at</b> the source code level. 1...|$|R
40|$|Variability in host-parasite {{interactions}} has considerable {{impact on}} the ecology and evolution of parasites and on the epidemiology of disease. The nature of the impact depends largely {{on the level of}} ecological organization where variability occurs: variability of parasites within their individual hosts, variability of host individuals within populations, or variability of hosts and parasites among populations. In this review, Paul Schmid-Hempel and Jacob Koella give some examples of <b>variability</b> <b>at</b> each of these levels, with particular emphasis on microparasites (defined broadly as viruses, bacteria and protozoa), consider the maintenance of the variability, and describe the implications of variability for the epidemiology of disease and the ecology of host-parasite associations. In particular, they describe how <b>variability</b> <b>at</b> each level of ecological organization can afiect the perceptio...|$|R
40|$|We study {{analytically}} and experimentally the throughput of the packetized time-varying discrete erasure channel with feedback, which closely {{captures the}} behavior of many practical physical layers. We observe that the channel <b>variability</b> <b>at</b> different time scales affects the link-level throughput positively or negatively depending on its time scale. We show that the increased variability in the channel at a time scale smaller than a single packet increases the link-level throughput, whereas the <b>variability</b> <b>at</b> a time scale longer than a single packet reduces it. We express the throughput {{as a function of}} the number of transmissions per packet and evaluate it as in terms of the cumulants of the samples of the stochastic processes, which model the channel. We also illustrate our results experimentally using mote radios...|$|R
