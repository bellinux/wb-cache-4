40|$|N the 1980 s <b>vat</b> <b>dyes,</b> bearing {{about 60}} 1 C. I. Names (I), were {{available}} in the U. S. under about 260 different trade names. This collection of dyes has not changed much in recent years. About 60 % of them have C. I. Numbers-i. e., ihe chemical structure of the principle color component is known; 85 % are derivatives of anthraquinone, and of these almost 50 % fall into only five chemical structure subgroups; indigo derivatives and the related thioindigo derivatives account for about 10 % of the list. As a class, <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> are expensive, although they share this characteristic with some fiber reactive dyes. One shouid not overlook the 10 % of so-called sulfurized <b>vat</b> <b>dyes,</b> which are more economical hybrids of sulfur and <b>vat</b> <b>dyes.</b> The practical details of using <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> in both batch and continuous processes are covered in this second and final part of Chapter 3. <b>Vat</b> <b>dyes</b> generally offer superior fastness properties.

50|$|Protein-based fibers such as silk, wool, and feathers, {{as well as}} the {{synthetic}} polyamide fiber, nylon, can be dyed with acid dyes. As may be expected from the name, acid dyes are effective at acidic (low) pH, where they form ionic bonds with the fiber. Acid dyes are also relatively safe (some are used as food dyes) and simple to use. <b>Vat</b> <b>dyes,</b> including indigo, are a third class of dyes that are effective on cellulosic fibers and silk. <b>Vat</b> <b>dyes</b> are insoluble in water in their unreduced form, and the <b>vat</b> <b>dye</b> must be chemically reduced before they can be used to color fabric. This is accomplished by heating the dye in a strongly basic solution of sodium hydroxide (lye) or sodium carbonate (caustic potash) containing a reducing agent such as sodium hydrosulfite or thiourea dioxide. The fabric is immersed in the dye bath, and after removal the <b>vat</b> <b>dye</b> oxidizes to its insoluble form, binding with high wash-fastness to the fiber. However, <b>vat</b> <b>dyes,</b> and especially indigo, must be treated after dyeing by 'soaping' to prevent the dye from rubbing (crocking) off. <b>Vat</b> <b>dyes</b> can be used to simultaneously dye the fabric and to remove underlying fiber-reactive dye (i.e., can dye a black cotton fabric yellow) because of the bleaching action of the reducing bath (see below). The extra complexity and safety issues (particularly when using strong bases such as lye) restrict use of <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> in tie-dye to experts.|$|R

40|$|Corona tretment {{consists}} on {{the application}} of an electrical discharge of high voltage (around 10. 000 V) through air between two electrodes, using frequencies around 40 kHz, at normal atmospheric temperature and pressure, on dry cotton fabric, {{that can be applied}} in textile processing allowing to rationalize water, energy and chemicals that are spent in huge amounts within this industry, fulfilling the requisites of the new world ecological demands imposed by environmental concerns. When Corona plasmatic radiation is applied as a pre-treatment of raw cotton fabric to be dyed with vat dyes, the process becomes shorter than the conventional one, lowering the costs and execution time, reflecting an economical and ecological impact on the textile process. This treatment is responsible by a complete hydrophilization of raw cotton by means of the oxidation of the hydrophobic layer, making cotton materials ready to dye directly skipping the stages of the preparation. The global differences between conventional <b>vat</b> <b>dyeing</b> process and the process with Corona are evaluated. The final treatment of <b>vat</b> <b>dyeing,</b> in which Corona is previously applied, will include an oxidation process to promote simultaneously insolubilization and cleaning of the fabric.

Aims and Objectives: To investigate the possible effect of occupational exposure to <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> on the functions of the liver. Materials and Methods: Using convenience sampling technique, a cohort of dye workers (n= 117) with a minimum of one year and a maximum of 60 years duration of exposure (mean = 17. 03 &#x 00 B 1; 1. 19 years) were recruited in this study. Sixty traders, matched for age and sex and who had no previous exposure to <b>vat</b> <b>dyes</b> were selected as controls. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain information on demographic, occupational and environmental characteristics of the subjects. Plasma activities of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and plasma concentrations of total protein, albumin and total bilirubin were measured using standard spectrophotometric methods. Statistical analyses: SPSS version 11. 0 was used for statistical analyses. Tests of significance were carried out using Student&#x 2032;s t test, and correlation co-efficient. Results and Conclusion : The activity of ALP and the concentrations of total protein and albumin were significantly lower (P &# 60; 0. 05) in the exposed group.

30|$|Indigotin {{is known}} {{to be one of the}} most fast natural dye since dyeing with indigo {{involves}} <b>vat</b> <b>dyeing</b> process which forms insoluble indigotin dye molecules within the fiber (Crews, 1987; Padfield & Landi, 1996). However, in a recent study on the degradation of indigotin in solution it was found that indigotin was highly susceptible to degradation by H 2 O 2 treatment with UV radiation forming isatin as main degradation product (Ahn et al., 2014). Similar oxidative degradation would have occurred by the thermal treatment of this study. It is interesting that indigotin in silk dyeing also showed a high degree of degradation by thermal treatment when the dye {{is known to}} be one of the most fast natural dye. Although indigo dye forms insoluble indigotin molecules within the fiber, the dye molecules do not have any chemical bonding sites with fiber nor it has possible sites for forming aggregates within themselves (Ahn et al., 2014). Therefore small indigotin particles are merely trapped in the amorphous area of the fiber (Ahn et al., 2014) which enable easy attack from external oxidative degradation forces.|$|E
