25|$|As {{communication}} was difficult due to geographical reasons, a private carrier service {{was established in}} 1868. This first Colombian private carrier provided a weekly mail service of El Dorado, which transported mail from the Siecha lagoon to Bogota, which lasted to 1870. Adhesives were created, a cliché was cut, the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> stamps was set to 1 real (10 centavos de peso) and printed on various available papers. The paper varies from plain white stationery, blue-striped paper, paper with watermarks, and a bluish and greenish paper up to squared notebook paper. The sheet size is not known, but there are blocks of four, some with tete-beche pairs, horizontal and vertical pairs and single stamps. Ten postally used covers are recorded between March and November 16, 1870, all related to {{the work on the}} site of the lagoon.|$|E
40|$|Most {{governments are}} now alive to the {{advertising}} and propaganda <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> stamps” Sir Dudley Stamp (1966) Professor of Geography Seventy {{years after the}} formation of the United Nations, the world continues to be plagued by civil disorder, territorial claims and border disputes. Currently, there are some 150 claims and disputes still outstanding. Previous published work has revealed that postage stamps have {{played a key role in}} the propaganda associated with territorial disputes in Latin American countries. This dissertation aims to ascertain whether this finding holds true for disputes outside of Latin America and to what extent postage stamp propaganda can influence these various disputes. This study then describes and examines the background of 20 selected territorial claims and two special situations in small territories in Europe, European Colonies and Asia. The disputes form a cross section of those which have occurred over the last 125 years. A brief historical and geographical review is included along with the known causation and the actual or possible solution to each dispute. Written and visual evidence is collected and presented to illustrate the role played by postage stamps in the propaganda associated with these selected small territorial disagreements. When appropriate, the relevant postal history is described and postage stamp examples illustrated. The results indicate that, in the disputes studied, violence and loss of life was endemic at some stage in the dispute. Potential or real economic gain was not the obvious prime trigger factor which initiated the dispute. Further analysis of the findings indicates that postage stamps do play an important role in the propaganda associated with territorial claims in Europe, European Colonies and in Asia. Specific examples are identified in which the role of the stamp proved to be a key item in exacerbating the discord further. No clear evidence could be demonstrated to indicate that the effects differed significantly in geographic or political terms between Europe and her Colonies. There is some evidence that stamp usage for political purposes may be more frequently used in recent years than in the past. In Asia, Japan has not utilised stamps for propaganda purposes in her territorial disputes. Postage stamps are a powerful source of political propaganda and can play an important role in territorial claims...|$|E

To mend this state of matters, Sir Rowland Hill fought his long and famous fight, the particulars of which I may not enter on just now, but which culminated in victory in 1840, when the Penny Post was established throughout the kingdom.

50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{purpose of}} a stamp is to indicate the prepayment <b>of</b> <b>postage.</b> Since different kinds and sizes of mail normally pay different amounts <b>of</b> <b>postage,</b> the stamps need to carry a value. In a very few cases, the denomination has been omitted; for instance, during the tumults of 1949 China, undenominated stamps were issued, so as to allow {{the price of a}} stamp to fluctuate on a daily basis depending on the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the gold yuan.|$|R

5000|$|In general, postal {{stationery}} is handled similarly to postage stamps; sold from post offices {{either at the}} face <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the printed <b>postage</b> or, more likely, with a surcharge to cover the additional cost of the stationery. It can {{take the form of}} an official mail issue produced only for the use of government departments. [...] It can be an issue of a military force where an army, perhaps in a distant war, issues letter sheets for the use of its troops to write home. Postal stationery can be overprinted by the government or, occasionally, by a private overprint. In emergency situations, {{postal stationery}} has been produced by handstamping envelopes with modified canceling devices; many of the rare Confederate postmasters' provisionals are of this form. Finally, some postal stationery can be printed to private order. In this last case, stamped stationery bearing indicia is applied with postal administration approval and with specified regulations, to paper or cards provided by private persons or organizations. Private impressions result in a wider range of denominations and designs compared with governmental issues.|$|R
