5|$|However, as he dies, Tyball {{reveals that}} {{he had decided to}} contain the Slasher of <b>Veils,</b> whose prison he had been weakening, within Arial as a way to prevent it from {{destroying}} the world. Arial asks the Avatar to prevent the Slasher of <b>Veils</b> from being unleashed, and magically teleports back to the surface to evacuate its inhabitants. With help from Garamon's ghost, the Avatar gathers the eight talismans of Cabirus and throws them in the volcano {{at the base of the}} Abyss; the energy they release allows Garamon to open a portal that will send the Slasher of <b>Veils</b> into another dimension. The Avatar is sucked through the portal into a chaotic alternate dimension, but escapes back to the Isle of the Avatar and makes it on board the Baron's ship as the volcano erupts. As the game ends, Garamon's spirit reveals that he teleported the inhabitants of the Abyss to another cave.|$|E
5|$|As they {{sail for}} Greenland, strange things begin {{to happen to}} the ships bearing the {{tourmaline}} <b>veils.</b> Marine life and sea birds of all kinds are attracted towards them, and crew stationed aboard them for too long begin acting intoxicated and amorous. The plant and animal life attracted to the ships experiences rapid growth, so that before they reach Greenland the ships look more like mountains or meadows than ships. Strange sea creatures never before seen appear around the ships, and when the expedition is ready to deploy the tourmaline <b>veils,</b> they have to cut through the riot of organic growth that has totally filled the ships. Once the energy of the <b>veils</b> is unleashed on Greenland, it melts the ice quickly but also has unanticipated effects. Prehistoric bones and plant remains that were buried under the ice are reanimated, and fuse together into monstrous forms made up of plant, animal, and mineral parts. Greenland, free of its icy burden, rises up, ripping from north to south in the process and becoming two separate islands. As the chapter ends, the now enormous monsters brought to life by the volcanic energy are spilling away from Greenland towards Europe.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Gymnopilus, {{it is located}} in the {{subgenus}} Gymnopilus and section Macrospori. The subgenus Gymnopilus was proposed by Henri Romagnesi as Cortinatae (while the genus was known as Fulvidula) in 1942, though the name Gymnopilus was given later by Rolf Singer. The subgenus is characterised by mushrooms that feature either no <b>veils,</b> or <b>veils</b> that do not form rings. The section Macrospori, proposed by Guzmán-Dávalos in 1995, is made up of large-spored species with ringless mushrooms. Molecular analysis revealed that G.maritimus forms a sister group to (that is, shares an immediate common ancestor with) the spectabilis–imperialis clade, a clade that includes G.imperialis, G.spectabilis, G.junonius (often considered synonymous with G.spectabilis), G.pampeanus, and others. G. maritimus forms a more inclusive clade along with the members of spectabilis–imperialis; while it produces the smallest fruit bodies, it shares with the other members strong, sturdy mushrooms, caps with fibrils (sometimes with scales) and large, warty spores that turn red in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's iodine.|$|E
40|$|<b>Veiling</b> among Muslim {{women is}} {{modelled}} {{as a form}} of cultural resistance which inhibits the transmission of secular values. � Individuals care about opinions of their community members and use <b>veiling</b> to influence these options. � Our theory predicts that <b>veiling</b> is highest when individuals from highly religious communities interact in highly secular environments. � This accounts for puzzling features of the new <b>veiling</b> movement since the 1970 s. � Though <b>veiling</b> helps retain religious values, we show that bans on <b>veiling</b> aimed at assimilation can be counterproductive. � By inducing religious types to segregate in local communities, bans on <b>veiling</b> can lead to increased religiosity. <b>Veil,</b> Islamic revival, Signalling, Identity, Economics of religion...|$|R

50|$|One of Nabarawi's mentors, Sa’d Zaghlu, {{regarded}} the fashioning of the <b>veil</b> {{in a way}} that was unorthodox to actual <b>veiling.</b> It was used more like a scarf designed to only cover the fact.

5|$|In 1910 Brooks had {{her first}} solo show at the prestigious Gallery Durand-Ruel, {{displaying}} thirteen paintings, almost all of women or young girls. Some were portraits; others showed anonymous models in interior scenes or against tonal backgrounds, often with pensive or withdrawn expressions. The paintings were generally naturalistic, showing an attentive eye for the details of Belle Époque fashion, with parasols, <b>veils,</b> and elaborate bonnets on display.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{left ear}} is set, {{according}} to art historian Norbert Schneider, unnaturally high and far back, parallel {{to her eyes}} rather than to her nose; this position is probably an artistic device used to continue {{the flow of the}} diagonal line of the veil's inner-right wing. In the 15th century, <b>veils</b> were normally worn for modesty, to hide the sensuality of the flesh. In this work the veil has the opposite effect; the woman's face is framed by the headdress to draw attention to her beauty.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the game, the Abyss-dwelling wizard brothers Garamon and Tyball accidentally summon a demon, the Slasher of <b>Veils,</b> while experimenting with inter-dimensional travel. Garamon is used as bait to lure the demon into a room imbued with virtue. However, the demon offers Tyball great power if he betrays Garamon. Tyball agrees, but the betrayal fails; Garamon is killed, but seals the demon inside the room. Because he lacks virtue, Tyball cannot re-enter by himself, and plans to sacrifice Baron Almric's daughter, Arial, at the doorway to gain entrance.|$|E
50|$|Tatars emigrating from Russia were unveiled. Though Muslim, {{they had}} been under Russian rule since the 17th century, and were in many ways Europeanized. Only settled Uzbeks and Tajiks had strict <b>veiling</b> practices, which Tamerlane {{supposedly}} initiated. Even among this population, <b>veiling</b> depended on social class and location. Urban women <b>veiled</b> with chachvon (face <b>veil)</b> and paranji (body <b>veil),</b> although {{the cost of the}} <b>veil</b> prevented poorer women from using it. Rural Uzbeks, meanwhile, wore a chopan, a long robe that could be pulled up to cover the mouth in the presence of men.|$|R
5000|$|In mycology, {{a partial}} <b>veil</b> (also called an inner <b>veil,</b> to {{differentiate}} {{it from the}} [...] "outer" [...] <b>veil,</b> or velum) is a temporary structure of tissue found on the fruiting bodies of some basidiomycete fungi, typically agarics. Its role is to isolate and protect the developing spore-producing surface, represented by gills or tubes, found on the lower surface of the cap. A partial <b>veil,</b> {{in contrast to a}} universal <b>veil,</b> extends from the stem surface to the cap edge. The partial <b>veil</b> later disintegrates, once the fruiting body has matured and the spores are ready for dispersal. It might then give rise to a stem ring, or fragments attached to the stem or cap edge. In some mushrooms, both a partial <b>veil</b> and a universal <b>veil</b> may be present.|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the issue of <b>veiling</b> within Islam. The first chapter covers a brief history of <b>veiling,</b> the {{different}} <b>veiling</b> forms and references to <b>veiling</b> in the Quran and in the Islamic tradition. Next chapters describe the relationship between Islam and feminism and also between Islam and fundamentalism. The main part of the thesis analyzes the ideas of several famous representatives of Muslim feminism, including Fatima Mernissi, Fadwa El Guindi and Leila Ahmed. The purpose of this work is to find out why is the issue of <b>veiling</b> an important part of "the woman question" in Islam and it offers perspectives of the representatives of Muslim feminism on the subject. The thesis also seeks to provide diverse views on the issue and reduce stereotypes frequently associated with <b>veiling.</b> Keywords <b>Veiling,</b> <b>veil,</b> feminism, fundamentalism, Muslim feminist...|$|R
5|$|Within the tropics, 36hours {{prior to}} the center passage of a {{tropical}} cyclone, a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches {{from the direction of}} the cyclone. In the mid to late 19th century, forecasters used these cirrus <b>veils</b> to predict the arrival of hurricanes. In the early 1870s the president of Belén College in Havana, Cuba, Father Benito Viñes, developed the first hurricane forecasting system, and he mainly used the motion of these clouds in formulating his predictions. He would observe the clouds hourly from 4:00 am to 10:00 pm. After accumulating enough information, Viñes began accurately predicting the paths of hurricanes, and he eventually summarized his observations in his book, Apuntes Relativos a los Huracanes de las Antilles.|$|E
5|$|Good field {{characteristics}} for Suillus luteus {{include the}} slimy brown cap, glandular dots {{on the upper}} stipe, and prominent purplish ring. A frequent lookalike is Suillus granulatus, which is another common, widely distributed and edible species occurring in the same habitat. Suillus granulatus is yellow fleshed and exudes latex droplets when young, but most conspicuously bears neither a partial veil nor a ring. Other than that, Suillus luteus {{is unlikely to be}} confused with other mushrooms, especially if its preferred habitat under pine trees and the whitish partial veil are considered. In Europe, the related Suillus grevillei is found under larch and has a yellow cap, while immature fruit bodies of Gomphidius glutinosus may look comparable from above but have gills rather than pores underneath. In North America, Suillus borealis and S.pseudobrevipes also have partials <b>veils,</b> but lack the distinctive ring of S.luteus. S.cothurnatus forms a band-like ring on the stipe that tends to be brownish rather than purplish.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{establishes}} {{a link between}} conceptions of female virtue {{and the practice of}} <b>veiling</b> by women from ancient to medieval times in the Mediterranean region. This is evidenced by the consistent advocacy and prescription of <b>veiling</b> in ancient and medieval theological texts, including Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian, and Islamic texts. <b>Veiling</b> practices are shown to have a religious foundation, grounded in the ideas of honor and virtue. These notions were reflected in society over time with <b>veiled</b> aristocratic noblewomen and unveiled marginalized classes. While acknowledging class-based theories of female <b>veiling,</b> the thesis concentrates on the religious factors for <b>veiling,</b> particularly for medieval Muslim societies. The argument of this thesis is that while <b>veiling</b> did not originate in Islamic societies, Muslims validated the practice through their own literature and laws. The paper also includes evidence of female seclusion, which co-exists with the spread in the practice of <b>veiling</b> by women...|$|R

For Algeria, <b>veiling</b> represented resistance to assimilation. Caught in between, the <b>veil</b> can be considered a metaphor for the Algerian colonization.

40|$|Abstract. This work aims {{to analyse}} within a {{rigorous}} framework, <b>veiling,</b> visual extinction and excess extraction from the spectra of T Tauri stars. We investigate further {{the method of}} Hartigan et al. (1989) for <b>veiling</b> estimate from small spectral bandwidth of a few tens of Angstroms. The calculated <b>veiling</b> value is sensitive to the estimated noise ratio and to spectral mismatches between the object and the reference. We show that an incorrect input noise ratio together with low contrast spectra in noise units can lead to important biasses and we propose solutions to minimize this problem. In case of spectral mismatches and for large contrast spectra compared to the residual of the <b>veiling</b> equation, the relative <b>veiling</b> bias {{is dominated by the}} apparent <b>veiling</b> of the reference with respect to the correct underlying object stellar spectrum. The <b>veiling</b> error is found to be proportional to the square of the <b>veiling</b> when the latte...|$|R
