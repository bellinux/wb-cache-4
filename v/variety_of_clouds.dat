Using fully-resolved direct numerical simulations, and neglecting the effects of fluid inertia on the particle motion, we determine the influence of the turbulence intensity and of gravita-tional settling, in a realistic range of parameters. At small Reynolds numbers, collisions are induced mainly by differential gravitational settling between particles with different orientations. The effect has a clear signature on the relative orientation of colliding ellipsoids.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the placement and size of clouds in the atmosphere has many applications in Atmo-spheric Science. In particular, clouds {{play a major role}} in the earth’s radiation budget. Given the large amounts of image data and the relative short time this information is relevant requires an automated detection algorithm that runs in real-time on current workstations. We present such an algorithm in this paper. We show that given daytime images, human ana-lysts agree amongst themselves at most 94 % on the placement of clouds within the image. The subjec-tivity of the problem motivates our approach. The algorithm uses a combination of neural networks to compute the probability of a pixel being clear or cloud. Images are first sorted into neighbor-hoods via a Self-Organizing map based on the im-age’s gray scale levels. After sorting, each pixel is processed using a Mixture of Experts neural net-work unique to the neighborhood. The calculation is of the probability that a pixel represents clear or cloudy. A pixel level cloud mask is then constructed by assigning the most likely designation to each pixel. The algorithm reliably identifies a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> from images. Relative agreements with human an-alysts are typically greater than 90 %.

We here report no convincing detection in an initial set of observations of 20 sources. We compare O 2 integrated intensities with those of C 18 O in a similarly sized beam and obtain 3 σ upper limits for the O 2 /C 18 O abundance ratio ≤ 2. 3 in four clouds and ≤ 3. 6 in five additional clouds. Our lowest individual limit corresponds to N(O 2) /N(H 2) 3 ̆c 2. 6 × 10 - 7 (3 σ). A combination of data from nine sources yields N(O 2) /N(H 2) = [0. 33 ± 1. 6 (3 σ) ] × 10 - 7.

The scanning, Doppler, and polarimetric capabilities of the WSR- 88 D allow real-time, three-dimensional mapping of cloud processes, such as transformations of hydrometeors between liquid and ice phases. The presence of ice particles is revealed by high differential reflectivities and the lack of correlation between reflectivity and differential reflectivity in clouds in contrast to that found for rain. Pockets of high differential reflectivities are frequently observed in clouds; maximal values of differential reflectivity exceed 8 dB, far above the level observed in rain.

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} {{for determining the}} ages of molecular clouds. The method utilizes {{the properties of the}} long-chain organic molecules known as the cyanopolyynes (HC/ 2 k + 1 /N, k = 0, 1, 2, 3 [...] .), which are found in a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds.</b> The observed regular abundance decline of these molecules as a function of chain length suggests that they are formed sequentially. If so, the age of the cloud can be read off as the time to grow the longest chain present. Although the creation process for the chains is still unknown, the age can be obtained from knowledge of the chain destruction mechanism. Destruction is probably due to adsorption onto the surfaces of interstellar grains. Using the known properties of grains, the age can be obtained from the cloud density and the abundance ratios of the cyanopolyynes. As a first application, minimum ages for the four dark clouds B 335, TMC- 1, TMC- 2, and L 183 are obtained. These minimum ages are 1. 3 x 10 to the 6 th yr, 9. 7 x 10 to the 5 th yr, 3. 4 x 10 to the 5 th yr, and 3. 3 x 10 to the 5 th yr, respectively.

40|$|International audiencePrevious {{observations}} {{suggest that}} Mixed Phase Clouds (MPC) occur {{frequently in the}} Arctic and often persist for many days due {{to a combination of}} local processes (microphysical and radiative for instance) and larger scale meteorological conditions. These low-level liquid containing clouds exert a large influence on the surface radiative fluxes and feedbacks on Arctic climate. However, understanding the spatial phase distribution within MPC remains a challenge. In this study, the MPC macrophysical and microphysical properties are investigated at a regional scale using CloudSat and CALIPSO observations (2007 - 2010) and at smaller scale with airborne in situ measurements performed in the Svalbard region. Results show that MPCs have a mean frequency of occurrence ranging from 30 % (end of winter) to 55 % (in autumn) in the Arctic. In the Svalbard region, the frequencies of occurrence are significantly higher with values ranging from 45 % to 60 %. MPCs are especially located at low altitudes, below 3000 m, where their occurrence reaches 90 %, particularly in winter, spring and autumn. Moreover, results highlight that MPCs are statistically more frequent over open sea than sea ice or land. These observations also allow us to assess how already performed small scale airborne measurements are representative of the <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> encountered in the Arctic. In situ measurements (44 vertical profiles obtained during ASTAR, POLARCAT, SORPIC) are statistically analyzed to derive representative profiles of MPC microphysical and optical properties (optical depth, liquid/water fraction, ice crystals habit).

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{operational}} missions and many investigations have assessed {{the potentialities of}} spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radars (SARs) operating at X band and above to monitoring the Earth surface. The most appealing aspect of these instruments is the capability of observing the Earth at very high spatial resolution (of the order of meters) and with a well-known sensitivity to water content, ground roughness, ground displacement (i. e., interferometry applications) and so on. These characteristics make this kind of instrument very suitable for monitoring floods, earthquakes, volcanoes, urban areas, infrastructures, land use and marine surfaces and to produce Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) with a resolution of few meters (e. g. COSMO-SkyMed, TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X systems). Moreover, fully-polarimetric SAR systems allow the complete characterization of target scattering properties to be measured, improving target classification capabilities. The experience gained throughout the mentioned missions has stimulated the development of SAR systems operating at higher frequencies, such as Ka-Band (around 35 GHz) and above, subject of many investigations. Nevertheless, sensitivity to atmospheric effects is a major concern. Numerous works {{in the last years}} have assessed how the atmosphere can influence spaceborne SARs operating at frequencies above C band. In particular, atmospheric water-based particles have demonstrated to condition SAR response echoes, both in amplitude and in phase, and in some extent the ground resolution, due to their turbulent motion in presence of precipitations. Such phenomenon are complex, and even if studied in the last decades, several issues are still open, especially respect polarimetric effects. Actually, the SAR slant-view echoes, are given by the ground surface backscattering, weighted by the two-way path attenuation, and significantly influenced by a volume contribution determined by the match water-based particles, characterized by their spatial distribution and electromagnetic properties (e. g. raindrops, snowflakes or ice droplets); moreover SAR band frequency and polarization differentiate the importance of such effects. To allow the comprehension of atmosphere on SAR received signal, we have developed a forward response model, where a known scenario is used to simulate the SAR slant echoes. The developed model is fully polarimetric and allows characterizing the SAR signature (in both amplitude and phase) in presence of a water-based particles distribution (e. g. precipitating cloud, such as cumulonimbus, or also non-precipitating one, such as cirrus), given a reference ground surface. In particular, we have model the Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS) and the complex correlation coefficient among copolarized returns, useful to characterize the signal differential phase shift (i. e., between horizontal and vertical polarizations: these represent the most significant elements of the measured covariance matrix, given by the one of the surface target with the superimposed scattering atmosphere. The polarimetric NRCS is model as combination of the clear-sky ground surface NRCS, weighted by the two-way atmospheric path attenuation, and by a volume contribution determined by the water-based particles reflectivity and extinction, still weighted by the two-way path attenuation. On the other hand, the observed complex correlation coefficient is modelled through the correlation coefficient of the ground target and hydrometeors reflectivity and specific differential phase, both weighted by the two-way path attenuation. The atmospheric scenario can be modeled through both synthetic scenarios, realized by stratified distributions of homogeneous particles (e. g. raindrops and ice) within a basic shape (e. g. rectangle or Gaussian) and realistic ones, produced by high resolution Cloud Resolving Models. The first scenarios are unrealistic but allow a better understating of the phenomenon and analysis of the SAR sensitivity range. On the other side, the second kind of target allows to establish a statistics of the applicability limits of the SAR atmospheric effects. In this work, realistic scenarios have been simulated using the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM) mesoscale model, that we have used to simulate high-resolution (250 m ground, in altitude ranging from 250 m to 800 m at 30 km height) tridimensional volumes (64 x 64 km 2 and 30 km height) of water-based particles. In particular SAM simulates water content (g/cm 3) distributions of precipitating (rain, snow, graupel) and non-precipitating (cloud ice and cloud liquid water) particles; on the other hand, their scattering properties have been characterized using T-Matrix simulation through the Hydrometeor-Ash Particle Ensemble Scattering Simulator (HAPESS). More exactly the SAR simulation datasets is composed by a significant number of vertical sections (each of them representing a simulation case study) has been selected among the available SAM 3 -D structures, as representative of the <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> systems (e. g. convective or stratiform). The ground surface scattering model completes the scenario. The framework can be easily configured to simulate bare soils, using for instance Semi-Empirical Models, as well as surface canonical targets, such as dihedrals or volume scattering, for an ease analysis of the effect of the atmosphere on the polarimetric signature and a comparison with literature works. In this work, we will use this model framework to analyze the distortions introduced by atmospheric effects, both in amplitude and phase, so focusing our attention not only on the most evident one, but also on other, less evident but still present, as phase distortions. This analysis will be performed on both X-band and Ka frequency bands. A verification of these results analysis will arise by the study of real COSMO-SkyMed and TerraSAR-X acquisitions...|$|E
