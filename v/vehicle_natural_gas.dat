2500|$|Because of its low density, it is {{not easy}} to store natural gas or to {{transport}} it by <b>vehicle.</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>gas</b> pipelines are impractical across oceans, since the gas needs to be cooled down and compressed, as the friction in the pipeline causes the gas to heat up. Many existing pipelines in America are close to reaching their capacity, prompting some politicians representing northern states to speak of potential shortages. The large trade cost implies that natural gas markets are globally much less integrated, causing significant price differences across countries. [...] In Western Europe, the gas pipeline network is already dense. New pipelines are planned or under construction in Eastern Europe and between gas fields in Russia, Near East and Northern Africa and Western Europe. See also List of natural gas pipelines.|$|E

50|$|Modern HEVs {{make use}} of efficiency-improving {{technologies}} such as regenerative brakes, which converts the vehicle's kinetic energy into electric energy to charge the battery, rather than wasting it as heat energy as conventional brakes do. Some varieties of HEVs use their internal combustion engine to generate electricity by spinning an electrical generator (this combination {{is known as a}} motor-generator), to either recharge their batteries or to directly power the electric drive motors. Many HEVs reduce idle emissions by shutting down the ICE at idle and restarting it when needed; this is known as a start-stop system. A hybrid-electric produces less emissions from its ICE than a comparably sized gasoline car, since an HEV's gasoline engine is usually smaller than a comparably sized pure gasoline-burning <b>vehicle</b> (<b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> and propane fuels produce lower emissions) and if not used to directly drive the car, can be geared to run at maximum efficiency, further improving fuel economy.|$|E

40|$|This {{invention}} {{is directed}} to the synthesis of high bulk density high gas absorption capacity adsorbents for gas storage applications. Specifically, this invention is concerned with novel gas absorbents with high gravimetric and volumetric gas adsorption capacities which are made from fullerene-based materials. By pressing fullerene powder into pellet form using a conventional press, then polymerizing it by subjecting the fullerene to high temperature and high inert gas pressure, the resulting fullerene-based materials have high bulk densities and high gas adsorption capacities. By pre-chemical modification or post-polymerization activation processes, the gas adsorption capacities of the fullerene-based adsorbents can be further enhanced. These materials are suitable for low pressure gas storage applications, such as oxygen storage for home oxygen therapy uses or on-board <b>vehicle</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> storage. They are also suitable for storing gases and vapors such as hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{abundance}} of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in the United States {{because of the}} number of existing <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> reserves and the recent advances in extracting unconventional reserves has been one of the main drivers for low <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> prices. A question arises of what is the optimal use of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> as a transportation fuel. Is it more efficient to use <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in a stationary power application to generate electricity to charge electric <b>vehicles,</b> compress <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> for onboard combustion in <b>vehicles,</b> or re-form <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> into a denser transportation fuel? This study investigates the well-to-wheels energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from various <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> to transportation fuel pathways and compares the results to conventional gasoline vehicles and electric vehicles using the US electrical generation mix. Specifically, <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles</b> running on compressed <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> are compared against electric vehicles charged with electricity produced solely from <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> combustion in stationary power plants.
