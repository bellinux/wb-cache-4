5|$|At the lek, {{males have}} been {{observed}} to break up into pairs, performing “confrontation displays”. This consists of facing each other while bowing, jumping, and flapping their wings, sometimes even snapping their bills, {{and at the same}} time giving off various squawking and grunting calls. When the female approaches, it becomes even more intense. The display turns into a cacophony of bright color and a frenzied activity filling the air with <b>very</b> <b>strange</b> sounds.|$|E
5|$|Archaea and {{bacteria}} are generally similar {{in size and}} shape, although a few archaea have <b>very</b> <b>strange</b> shapes, such as the flat and square-shaped cells of Haloquadratum walsbyi. Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria, archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are {{more closely related to}} those of eukaryotes, notably the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes, including archaeols. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from organic compounds, such as sugars, to ammonia, metal ions or even hydrogen gas. Salt-tolerant archaea (the Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea fix carbon; however, unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no known species of archaea does both. Archaea reproduce asexually by binary fission, fragmentation, or budding; unlike bacteria and eukaryotes, no known species forms spores.|$|E
5|$|Many Flemish {{immigrants}} {{arrived in}} eastern England during the 12th century, {{and they were}} persecuted after Henry II became king in 1154; {{a large number of}} them were killed near Bury St Edmunds in 1173 at the Battle of Fornham fought between Henry II and Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester. Paul Harris has suggested that the green children's Flemish parents perished during a period of civil strife and that the children may have come from the village of Fornham St Martin, slightly to the north of Bury St Edmunds, where a settlement of Flemish fullers existed at that time. They may have fled and ultimately wandered to Woolpit. Disoriented, bewildered, and dressed in unfamiliar Flemish clothes, the children would have presented a <b>very</b> <b>strange</b> spectacle to the Woolpit villagers. The children's colour could be explained by green sickness, the result of a dietary deficiency. Brian Haughton considers Harris's explanation to be plausible, and the one most widely accepted, although not without its difficulties. For instance, he suggests it is unlikely that an educated local man like Richard de Calne would not have recognised the language spoken by the children as being Flemish.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, well--good-night, constable," [...] said Mr Twitter, {{moving slowly}} {{forward in a}} mystified state of mind, while the {{guardian}} of the night continued his rounds, thinking to himself {{that he had just}} parted from one of the <b>very</b> <b>strangest</b> of the people.|$|R
6000|$|... "Too true," [...] Mr. Fentolin sighed. [...] "The poor creature! I {{offered her}} a small pension, but she {{would have none of}} it. A {{superior}} woman in her way once, filled now with queer fancies," [...] he went on, eyeing Hamel steadily,--"the <b>very</b> <b>strangest</b> fancies. She spends her life prowling about here. No one in the village even knows how she lives. Did she speak of me, by-the-by?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I see her {{perfectly}} from here. She resents, for all {{the world}} like some high little personage, the imputation on her truthfulness and, as it were, her respectability. 'Miss Jessel indeed--SHE!' Ah, she's 'respectable,' the chit! The impression she gave me there yesterday was, I assure you, the <b>very</b> <b>strangest</b> of all; it was quite beyond any of the others. I DID put my foot in it! She'll never speak to me again." ...|$|R
5|$|Mulder {{telephones}} Scully {{and tries}} to explain that he's the real Mulder. Scully does not believe him and asks Fletcher—in Mulder's body—to pick up {{and listen to the}} conversation. Fletcher decides they should immediately report this incident, which further confuses Scully. She goes to Mulder’s apartment (where Fletcher is having a tryst with Kersh's assistant) and tells Fletcher that they traced the telephone call to a pay phone near Area 51 and she suspects it is Mulder's informant. Fletcher is indifferent to this news and Scully yells at him, sensing that his behavior is <b>very</b> <b>strange</b> and his lack of concern for the X-Files is completely out of character. Scully decides to investigate, and drives through the desert towards Area 51. She stops at a burned out gas station and finds a penny and a dime merged. Later, when Scully arrives at Fletcher's house, Mulder tries desperately to convince Scully that he is really Mulder. Scully remains skeptical and thinks that any information Mulder describes could be obtained in other ways. Mulder tells Scully that he will bring proof of the defect of the UFO and the resultant problems that night, but Fletcher, having eavesdropped on the conversation, calls his old office posing as Mulder to inform them of the source of the leak—Mulder posing as Fletcher. Military police arrive at the appointed hour, and Mulder is dragged away, kicking and screaming, desperately trying to convince Scully. Mulder asks if he would turn in an informant to the authorities in this manner as he is carried away, and Scully begins to realize that Mulder may be telling the truth.|$|E
25|$|Hogan has {{emphasised}} that {{it would}} be <b>very</b> <b>strange</b> if all fundamental constants were strictly determined, since this would leave us with no ready explanation for apparent fine tuning. In fact we might have to resort to something akin to Barrow and Tipler's SAP: there would be no option for such a universe not to support life.|$|E
25|$|I {{see people}} who write {{characters}} who are loonies and make them convincing and believable, and I envy them tremendously. I don’t really understand them. It’s funny, because I’ve created my own monster. In the ‘Great War’ and ‘American Empire’ books, I’m writing {{the person who is}} the functional equivalent of Adolf Hitler. I’m inside his head — and that’s a <b>very</b> <b>strange</b> place for somebody who thinks of himself as a fairly rational fellow to be. That’s alarming.|$|E
6000|$|... "He has had {{the same}} summons as we, and is bound for the same destination," [...] said my uncle, glancing over his {{shoulder}} at the distant barouche. [...] "We are both wanted at Cliffe Royal--we, the two survivors of that black business. And it is Jim Harrison of all people who calls us there. Nephew, I have had an eventful life, but I feel as if the <b>very</b> <b>strangest</b> scene of it were waiting for me among those trees." ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not know}} it, {{but that was the}} last civilised dinner I was to eat for <b>very</b> many <b>strange</b> and terrible days.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know quite}} a lot," [...] Klaus said. [...] "Actually, you saw <b>very</b> little. <b>Strange</b> {{that you should}} have been such an acute observer." ...|$|R
25|$|By May 1863 Bahá'u'lláh was exiled next to Constantinople, {{the capital}} of the Ottoman Empire, and his family went with him. Now aged seventeen, after {{arriving}} in Constantinople, Bahíyyih Khánum renounced the idea of marriage. This was <b>very</b> <b>strange</b> for a woman of her rank and era, however it was a request which Bahá’u’lláh gladly accepted. After a short while in Constantinople the family was again exiled to Adrianople. Bahíyyih Khánum describes how she was a strong young woman until the journey to Adrianople. Adrianople proved a very unhappy period for the young Bahíyyih Khánum.|$|E
25|$|Crisólogo and Legasto {{began the}} novena, {{and on the}} third and fourth day, Legasto {{reported}} that she experienced a <b>very</b> <b>strange</b> feeling. This sensation, she said, was as though something heavy was moving from {{the top of her head}} down through her body before leaving her. Her health then gradually improved to the point that she travelled to the United States for further treatment. Before she left, she had a checkup; no pleurisy was found but the doctors found a benign tumor. She reported that she still felt some pain; despite the discomfort, she considers the pains she suffers as a blessing, an offering to our Lord in atonement for her sins.|$|E
25|$|France Modern {{remained}} the French royal standard, {{and with a}} white background was the French national flag until the French Revolution, when it {{was replaced by the}} tricolor of modern-day France. The fleur-de-lis was restored to the French flag in 1814, but replaced once again after the revolution against Charles X of France in 1830. In a <b>very</b> <b>strange</b> turn of events {{after the end of the}} Second French Empire, where a flag apparently influenced the course of history, Henri, comte de Chambord, was offered the throne as King of France, but he agreed only if France gave up the tricolor and brought back the white flag with fleurs-de-lis. His condition was rejected and France became a republic.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must say}} he looked awful. Had a bad bout of the ague probably. The left shore is <b>very</b> unhealthy. <b>Strange</b> {{that only the}} breadth of the river [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Josiah, you do {{not know}} that. They say that the thing is <b>very</b> strange,--so <b>strange</b> that it {{requires}} a trial; but no one thinks you have taken that which was not your own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your boat!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Is {{this your}} boat? I didn't know that. But {{where is my}} boat? Did you see a sail-boat leave here? It is <b>very</b> strange--remarkably <b>strange!</b> I don't {{know what to make}} of it." ...|$|R
25|$|A mysterious man, Griffin, {{arrives at}} the local inn of the English village of Iping, West Sussex, during a snowstorm. The {{stranger}} wears a long-sleeved, thick coat and gloves; his face is hidden entirely by bandages except for a fake pink nose; and he wears a wide-brimmed hat. He is excessively reclusive, irascible, and unfriendly. He demands {{to be left alone}} and {{spends most of his time}} in his rooms working with a set of chemicals and laboratory apparatus, only venturing out at night. While Griffin is staying at the inn, hundreds of strange glass bottles (that he calls his luggage) arrive. Many local townspeople believe this to be <b>very</b> <b>strange.</b> He becomes the talk of the village with many theorizing as to his origins.|$|E
25|$|Poirot instructs {{her to tell}} Andersen {{that she}} is going to come into a large sum of money that she will leave to the Flock, that she has {{problems}} with her lungs, and that Mrs Clegg will soon inherit a large sum from an aunt, more than her present estate. Poirot also asks if she has met a Mr Cole at the sanctuary. Miss Carnaby has and to her he is a <b>very</b> <b>strange</b> man. As if to prove her assertion correct, soon afterwards Mr Cole accosts Miss Carnaby with tales of his strange visions which involve sacrifices, Jehovah, and even Odin. She is saved from further strange tales by the arrival of Mr Lipscombe, the lodge-keeper of the Devonshire estate.|$|E
25|$|According to this theory, in 1554, {{after the}} immolation of Michael de Villeneuve/Servetus, the editors and {{printers}} that {{had worked with}} him would have {{decided to make a}} new De Materia Medica as a tribute to their colleague and friend. All the commentaries that could identify Michel de Villeneuve as the author disappeared, but the rest are copied from his work of 1543. It is a <b>very</b> <b>strange</b> edition because there exist four different kinds of copies with different covers, one per editor: Jean Frellon, Guillaume Rouillé, Antoine Vicent and Balthazar Arnoullet, who was also the printer of this unique edition, in Lyons. For developing a bigger work and to blur the mark of Michel de Villeneuve, they hired the expert on De Materia Medica, Pietro Andrea Mattioli.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is <b>very</b> sad--very <b>strange!</b> I cannot {{understand}} it,' said Theodora. 'I {{had always}} believed that such innocence and lowliness as Emma and Violet have was a guard against all snares; yet here is Emma led astray by these very excellences!' ...|$|R
50|$|Cailletoque - A <b>strange</b> <b>very</b> {{long and}} heavy matchlock. This musket was often carried under the arm.|$|R
6000|$|Again I thought I must be dreaming. [...] "Do you know, Miss Stella," [...] I said, [...] "it is <b>very</b> strange--so <b>strange</b> that {{it almost}} seems as though {{it could not be}} true--but I also came from Garsingham in Oxfordshire many years ago." ...|$|R
25|$|When we {{point out}} the need of {{opposing}} Trotskyism we discover a <b>very</b> <b>strange</b> phenomenon, that voices are raised in its defense {{in the ranks of}} certain organizations and among certain circles in certain parties. These voices belong to people who themselves are intoxicated with this counter-revolutionary ideology. The Trotskyists have long been transformed into the agents of Fascism, into the agents of the German Gestapo. We saw this on the ground during the May putsch in Catalonia; we saw this clearly in the disturbances that occurred in various other places. And everybody will realize this when the trial opens against the P.O.U.M. leaders who were caught spying. And we realize that the hand of Fascism is behind every attempt to demoralize our home front, to undermine the authority of the Republic. Therefore it is essential that we wipe out Trotskyism with a firm hand, for Trotskyism is no longer a political option for the working class but an instrument of the counter-revolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{title of this}} pas was Les Aventures Amourouse de Diane or simply the Pas de Diane and was originally a pas de trois danced by Diana the Roman Goddess of the Hunt, Endymion the shepherd and a satyr, reflecting {{the myth of the}} passion between Diana and Endymion. It is believed that Petipa's inspiration for this pas was a painting by the Russian painter, Karl Bryullov. The traditional version that is danced today is not by Petipa, but by Agrippina Vaganova, who staged her own version of the Pas de Diane when she transferred it into a revival of La Esmeralda in 1935. She altered the scheme by removing the role of the satyr and changing the lead male role to the hunter, Actaeon, with whom Diana dances in the company of twelve of her nymphs. This was a <b>very</b> <b>strange</b> change on Vaganova's part since Diana and Actaeon were not lovers, but had one association when he stumbled upon her bathing naked with her nymphs, after which, she transformed him into a stag and he was hunted down and killed by his own hunting dogs.|$|E
500|$|Various {{explanations}} for Uru Lives continuing troubles were given. Game designer Ernest Adams stated that [...] "An {{important part of}} Mysts atmosphere came from being alone in a <b>very</b> <b>strange</b> place." [...] Adams stated that the realities of online play distracted from the fantasy setting. When asked about the game's commercial failure, Miller responded: ...|$|E
50|$|In 1995 {{the weight}} {{draining}} {{caught up with}} Norris, as a <b>very</b> sluggish, <b>strange</b> performance saw him lose his belt to Nate Miller via 8th round KO in London, England. Norris was hospitalised after the fight although he checked himself out the following morning.|$|R
5000|$|Tolkien wrote [...] "There was {{something}} <b>very</b> remote and <b>strange</b> and beautiful behind those words, if I could grasp it, far beyond ancient English." ...|$|R
6000|$|Of all {{the strange}} assertions into which {{speculation}} without practical acquaintance with a subject may lead even an able man, I {{think this is}} the <b>very</b> <b>strangest.</b> Physiology not an experimental science! Why, there is not a function of a single organ in the body which has not been determined wholly and solely by experiment. How did Harvey determine the nature of the circulation, except by experiment? How did Sir Charles Bell determine the functions of the roots of the spinal nerves, save by experiment? How do we know the use of a nerve at all, except by experiment? Nay, how do you know even that your eye is your seeing apparatus, unless you make the experiment of shutting it; or that your ear is your hearing apparatus, unless you close it up and thereby discover that you become deaf? ...|$|R
500|$|Smith {{commented on}} the surrealism of the Oscars experience: [...] "That's exactly what it was, surreal... I enjoy {{performing}} {{almost as much as}} I enjoy making up songs in the first place. But the Oscars was a <b>very</b> <b>strange</b> show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was {{a lot of people who}} didn't come to hear me play. I wouldn't want to live in that world, but it was fun to walk around on the moon for a day." ...|$|E
500|$|That sitcom {{tradition}} is <b>very</b> <b>strange</b> when you're performing to both {{a camera and}} an audience at the same time...The thing that sometimes held us up is my stammer. Some words and some phrases did catch me out..."B"s in particular. I remember one episode in which Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie were going [...] "woof" [...] a lot, and my line was [...] "it's like Battersea Dogs Home in here". The B of Battersea was a problem for me. The floor manager suggested that I say [...] "Crufts" [...] instead.|$|E
500|$|One of Jenny's storylines {{in season}} two was her revelation of being sexually abused as a child. The events were portrayed {{in a series}} of flashbacks and dream sequences. Yet, this left viewers {{confused}} about what actually happened to Jenny. During an interview with LGBT monthly magazine The Advocate, Chaiken commented about the storyline: [...] "Well we all know it was an incident of sexual abuse. I had not wanted to be more explicit about it than that – one because memory of trauma is <b>very</b> <b>strange.</b> Who knows what happened to Jenny? Jenny doesn't necessarily know herself." ...|$|E
5000|$|Luis Buñuel: [...] "It's perfect. It's a <b>very</b> {{profound}} and <b>strange</b> play. I think {{the author is}} completely surrealist, which for me is great praise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, son. I {{was looking}} at that trinket which you wear. Of course I have noted it before, but never closely. It is <b>strange,</b> <b>very</b> strange!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear {{this will}} kill his mother," [...] she said. [...] "Poor Reni-Mamba is {{so full of}} love and gentleness, and her sorrows have been <b>very</b> heavy. <b>Strange</b> that her husband and son should share the same fate--perpetual slavery! Yet it is not perpetual. Death will set them free. Come to the cave and let us break the sad news." ...|$|R
