40|$|SAFT {{prismatic}} wound 5 Ahr MP series {{cells were}} evaluated for potential application in a lithium ion battery designed for Tactical Mobile Robots (TMR). In order to satisfy battery design requirements, a 10 Ahr battery containing two parallel 8 -cell strings was proposed. The proposed battery has a weight and volume of approximately 3. 2 kg and 1. 6 liters, respectively. Cell qualification procedures include initial characterization, followed by charge/discharge cycling at 100 % DOD with intermittent EIS measurements at <b>various</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> charge. Certain cells were also subjected to extreme operational temperatures for worst-case analysis. Excellent specific energy (> 130 Whr/kg) was obtained with initial characterization cycles. Even at abusive thermal conditions, the cell capacity fade {{was less than}} Ahr after 300 cycles. Rate characterization showed good cell discharge behavior with minimal decrease in capacity. At <b>various</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> charge, impedance measurements suggest that the cathode play a more significant role in capacity.

The Destroying Angel was painted shortly after Etty's visit to Paris {{in which he}} had witnessed the July Revolution at first hand, and the sight and smell of the dead in the streets had left a strong impression on him. The heaped bodies in The Destroying Angel were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France, and perhaps also by the cholera epidemic which killed thousands in London in 1832.|$|E
5|$|Jains {{believe that}} karma is a {{physical}} substance that is everywhere in the universe. Karma particles are attracted to the soul {{by the actions of}} that soul. Karma particles are attracted when we do, think, or say things, when we kill something, when we lie, when we steal and so on. Karma not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in <b>various</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.|$|E

It was the first film to portray openly the clash between the principles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and homosexuality, and its exhibition in some U.S. states was controversial. Various religious groups demanded that the film be withdrawn from theaters and video stores under boycott threats.|$|E
5|$|The Triumph of Cleopatra {{illustrates}} {{a scene from}} Plutarch's Life of Antony and Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, in which Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, travels to Tarsus in Cilicia aboard a magnificently decorated ship to cement an alliance with the Roman general Mark Antony. An intentionally cramped and crowded composition, it shows a huge {{group of people in}} <b>various</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> undress, gathering on the bank to watch the ship's arrival. Although not universally admired in the press, the painting was an immediate success, making Etty famous almost overnight. Buoyed by its reception, Etty devoted much of the next decade to creating further history paintings containing nude figures, becoming renowned for his combination of nudity and moral messages.|$|E

Agesilaus's force from Asia, composed largely of emancipated helots and mercenary veterans of the Ten Thousand, was augmented by half a Spartan regiment from Orchomenus, and another half a regiment that had been transported across the Gulf of Corinth. These armies met each other at Coronea, in Theban territory; as at Nemea, both right wings were victorious, with the Thebans breaking through {{while the rest of}} the allies were defeated. Seeing that the rest of their force had been defeated, the Thebans formed up to break back through to their camp. Agesilaus met their force head on, and in the struggle that followed a number of Thebans were killed before the remainder were able to force their way through and rejoin their allies. After this victory, Agesilaus sailed with his army across the Gulf of Corinth and returned to Sparta.|$|E

5|$|In April 2005, New York {{reached a}} {{settlement}} with Super Steel to close the rehabilitation project for $5.5 million, requiring them to stop work on the project, cover remaining costs, and move four unfinished trains into storage at a nearby industrial park. This settlement, when added to the $64.8 million previously spent, brought total project expenses—the results of which were three rehabilitated trainsets and four others in <b>various</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> repair—to $70.3 million. In 2007, Amtrak and New York settled their own lawsuit, with Amtrak paying New York $20 million. Amtrak and New York further agreed to commit $10 million each to implement track improvements in the Empire Corridor. New York, which was paying $150,000 per year to store the unused trains, auctioned off its four surplus Turboliners in 2012 for $420,000, including spare parts; scrapping began in 2013.|$|E
