The embryo yields from 101 embryo recoveries were examined in maiden Holstein heifers (n= 75) and multiparous Holstein cows (lactating cows n= 20, dry cows n= 6). Donors were super stimulated with FSH and embryo recovery was done non-surgically 7 days after artificial insemination. Embryos were classified according to the IETS criteria. Pregnancy rates in 100 maiden Holstein heifer recipients were analysed. Recipients were on day 7 +/- 1 of the estrous cycle at transfer. Pregnancy diagnosis was carried out at day 30 (PD 30) and rechecked at day 60 (PD 60) after transfer. Blood samples from coccygeal vessels taken at the time of embryo recovery (donors) and transfer (recipients) were analysed for IGF- 1, insulin, beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), urea and cholesterol. There was a negative correlation between the number of <b>viable</b> <b>embryos</b> and insulin (r=- 0. 33, P= 0. 025) in donor heifers.

50|$|Otx2 is a {{group of}} {{homeobox}} genes that are typically described as a head organizer in the primitive streak stage of embryonic development. Otx2, which is an encoded protein that plays the role of a transcription factor, has also been shown {{to be involved in the}} regional patterning of the midbrain and forebrain. This group of genes demonstrates later in progression to have an influence on the formation of the sensory organs, pituitary gland, pineal gland, inner ear, eye and optic nerve. Otx2 not only has a prominent role in developing this area but also aids in insuring that the retina and brain stay intact. This group of genes has a huge role in development and if it is expressed incorrectly it can have detrimental effects on the fetus. Otx2 mutations have also been associated with seizures, developmental delays, short stature, structural abnormalities of the pituitary gland, and an early onset of degeneration of the retina. A “knockout” model on the group of Otx2 genes has been performed to see what effects it would have on the adult retina. It was found that without the Otx2 gene expression there was slow degeneration of photoreceptor cells in this area. Thus, proving that the homeobox genes of Otx2 are essential in forming a <b>viable</b> <b>embryo.</b>|$|E

For this purpose, 69 clinically healthy Holstein cows were enrolled in the study. At the start of the superovulation procedure (Day 0), blood and endometrial samples were obtained to determine metabolic and uterine status, respectively. The cows were then subjected to porcine follicle stimulating hormone (pFSH) superovulation treatment, and embryos were recovered after 7 days. The mean number of embryos obtained per flush was 9. 89 ± 8. 21 (4. 63 ± 5. 34 <b>viable</b> <b>embryos,</b> 0. 82 ± 2. 01 degenerated embryos and 4. 57 ± 6. 44 unfertilized ova). The following statistically significant variables were entered in a regression model: beta-hydroxybutyrate, serum cholesterol, body condition, number of calvings and percentage of neutrophils. In almost all cases, the model explained some percentage of the variance: total number of embryos, 4. 8 % (p < 0. 05); number of degenerate embryos, 4. 2 % (p = 0. 051); and number of unfertilized ova, 14. 2 % (p < 0. 01). Statistical models for the percentage of <b>viable</b> <b>embryos</b> and unfertilized ova accounted for 24. 0 % and 29. 4 % of the variance, respectively, and both were statistically significant (p < 0. 01).
