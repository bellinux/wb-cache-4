5000|$|... #Subtitle level 3: Valve, <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> and {{valve seat}} (intake/exhaust valves) ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{aircraft}} piston engines, {{the valve}} guides are typically shaped in a tube with a flare at one end, {{so as to}} resemble in section, the letter [...] "T". Their replacement involves removing the worn part by driving {{it out with a}} hammer and specifically-shaped punch. Installation involves heating the cylinder (with its integral head) and freezing the <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> so as to ease insertion, and then driving the new guide in quickly with a hammer. Once the parts return to room temperature the new <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> will be solidly in place and ready to be reamed and honed to proper diameter.|$|E
50|$|In most {{types of}} {{reciprocating}} engines, a <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> is provided for each poppet valve in the cylinder head. Along with the valve spring, it serves to positively locate the valve {{so that it}} may make proper contact with the valve seat. A <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> is a cylindrical piece of metal, pressed or integrally cast into the cylinder head, with the valve reciprocating inside it. Guides also serve to conduct heat from the combustion process out from the exhaust valve and into the cylinder head where it may be {{taken up by the}} cooling system. Bronze is commonly used, as is steel; a balance between stiffness and wear on the valve is essential to achieve a useful service life.|$|E
500|$|Twelve {{cylinders}} {{consisting of}} high-carbon steel liners set in two, two-piece cylinder blocks of cast [...] "R.R.50" [...] aluminium alloy having separate heads and skirts. Wet liners, ie. coolant in {{direct contact with}} external face of liners. Cylinder heads fitted with cast-iron inlet <b>valve</b> <b>guides,</b> phosphor bronze exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>guides,</b> and renewable [...] "Silchrome" [...] steel-alloy valve seats. Two diametrically opposed spark plugs protrude into each combustion chamber.|$|R
2500|$|Twelve {{cylinders}} {{consisting of}} high-carbon steel, floating wet liners set in two, two-piece cylinder blocks of cast aluminium alloy having separate heads and skirts. Cylinder liners chromium plated in the bores for [...] {{inches from the}} head. Cylinder blocks mounted with an included 60-degree angle onto inclined upper faces of a two-piece crankcase. Cylinder heads fitted with cast-iron inlet <b>valve</b> <b>guides,</b> phosphor bronze exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>guides,</b> and renewable [...] "Silchrome" [...] steel-alloy valve seats. Two diametrically opposed spark plugs protrude into each combustion chamber.|$|R
50|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} which show that through the proper selection of the reamer and reaming process, <b>valves</b> <b>guides</b> can be quickly and efficiently reamed to a consistently repeatable size.|$|R
50|$|Over time, {{the inner}} {{diameter}} of the <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> and the outer {{diameter of the}} valve stem may become worn. In the 1980s, many U.S. production engine remanufacturers began reaming valve guides, rather than replacing them, {{as part of their}} remanufacturing process. They found that by reaming all the valve guides in a head to one standard size (typically 0.008 in. diametrically oversized), and installing remanufactured engine valves having stems that are also oversized, a typical engine head can be remanufactured in much less time. Since the reaming process leaves the <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> with a much better surface finish and shape than typical replacement guides, and since the oversize valves often have chrome plated stems, remanufacturers also discovered that valve train warranty issues are virtually eliminated.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} ways in which a valve seat may be {{improperly}} positioned or machined. These include incomplete seating during the press fitting-step, distortion of the nominally circular valve seat surfaces such they deviate unacceptably from perfect roundness or waviness, tilt of the machined surfaces relative to the <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> hole axis, deviation of the valve seat surfaces from concentricity with the <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> holes, and deviation of the machined conical section of the valve seat from the cone angle that is required to match the valve surface. Automated quality control of inserted and machined valve seats has traditionally been very difficult to achieve until the advent of digital holography which has enabled high-definition metrology for measuring all of these listed deviations.|$|E
50|$|The {{clearance}} {{between the}} inner {{diameter of the}} <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> and the outer diameter of the poppet valve stem is critical for the proper performance of an engine. If there is too little clearance, the valve may stick as oil contaminants and thermal expansion become factors. If {{there is too much}} clearance, the valve may not seat properly and excessive oil consumption can occur.|$|E
40|$|Characterization of hardness, mass loss, and {{friction}} coefficient, {{was carried}} out on <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> for internal combustion engines, manufactured by powder metallurgy, {{with the aim of}} finding out if they fulfill the requirements of an internal combustion engine and to be mass produced. Currently available brass casting <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> were used as comparative parameter. It was analyzed whether properties were present in a homogeneous way in the piece lengthwise; the additional repressing process carried out in the production line with respect to the sintered guides was evaluated. Therefore, Brinell, Vickers and dry slip pin-on-disk tests were done {{in order to determine the}} friction coefficient and the wear rate. Scanning electron microscopy SEM and the metallographic analysis were used to study the wear mechanism, chemical composition of the guides, and the effect of repressing -quantifying the porosity. It was clear that these pieces manufactured by powder metallurgy process showed lower values in their mechanical-tribological properties compared to commercially available <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> taken as reference. With these results, the company which manufactures the guides by powder metallurgy will make some adjustments suggested for the parameters at the guide’s production line...|$|R
50|$|The 1928 DeLuxe engine {{had higher}} compression, and hardened, {{polished}} steel <b>valve</b> <b>guides.</b> The front end {{was changed to}} leading link forks and a front brake was added. The wheels were also changed to drop center rims (may have happened mid year).|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the valve design for these motors was the double <b>valve</b> <b>guides,</b> and the {{attachment}} of the forked rocker arm to a shoulder between the guides, to eliminate side forces on the valve stem and ensure maximum valve life under racing conditions.|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of a hole, usually round or oval, and a tapered plug, usually a disk shape {{on the end of}} a shaft also called a valve stem. The portion of the hole where the plug meets with it is referred to as the 'seat' or 'valve seat'. The shaft guides the plug portion by sliding through a <b>valve</b> <b>guide.</b> In exhaust applications a pressure differential helps to seal the valve and in intake valves a pressure differential helps open it. Poppet valves date from at least the 1770s, when James Watt used them on his steam engines.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in 1997 (1998 model year), all Corollas for the North American market {{were now}} built in Fremont, California (by NUMMI) or Cambridge, Ontario (by TMMC). Unlike the Japanese counterparts, the North American Corolla {{at this time}} was only offered as a four-door compact sedan. A new all-aluminum 1ZZ-FE engine powered all Corollas, making this {{generation}} lighter than its predecessor. This new engine uses a timing chain instead of a timing belt. It also incorporated laser etched valve guides directly in the block, rather than the old shrink to fit valve guides in the predecessor Corolla motor (4A-FE & 7A-FE). This prevents oil burning and <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> failure in the future.|$|E
50|$|The Prizm's 1998 {{redesign}} {{coincided with}} the conversion of all remaining Geo models into Chevrolets. The most notable change was the new 1.8-liter engine, which was now all-aluminum, driven by a timing chain (instead of a belt), and making more power (with the same fuel economy) than the engines from the Geo years. The new all-aluminum 1ZZ-FE engine powered all Corollas, Sprinters, and Prizms, making this generation lighter than its predecessor. This new engine incorporated laser-etched valve guides directly in the block, rather than the old shrink to fit valve guides in the previous Corolla motor (4A-FE & 7A-FE). This prevented oil burning and <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> failure. The Prizm with the Corolla became the first cars in the compact class to offer optional side airbags. All 1998 Prizms without the LSi's optional handling package (containing a front stabilizer bar) were singled out by Consumer Reports for having sloppy emergency handling; Toyota addressed the problem for 1999 by making the handling package standard. For 2000, the engine gained variable valve timing for five extra horsepower (to 125). The last Prizm was built on December 13, 2001, resulting in a brief 2002 model year.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine is}} of rugged {{heavy-duty}} construction throughout. All wearing parts such as cylinder liners, bearings, <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> and inserts are precision parts and are readily replaceable, which adds to engine life {{and ease of}} repair. Large main bearing and crankpin journals assure long bearing life." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cylinder head. A {{cylinder}} head assembly is installed {{with a head}} gasket and torqued to specification. Complete {{cylinder head}}s include valves, <b>valve</b> springs, <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> (if applicable), <b>valve</b> seats (if applicable), valve locks, and valve keepers. Flathead engines include the valve train if it didn't come with the short block.|$|R
50|$|As <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> wear, {{their ability}} to {{positively}} locate the valve to the valve seat decreases. As the valves lose {{their ability to}} seal the combustion chamber properly, the engine can lose performance and start to burn oil, leaking {{from the top of}} the cylinder head into the intake and exhaust manifolds. Modern engines are fitted with valve stem oil seals which can be replaced if oil leakage occurs.|$|R
5000|$|Avgas is {{currently}} available in several grades with differing maximum lead concentrations. Because tetraethyllead {{is an expensive}} and polluting ingredient, the minimum amount needed to bring the fuel to the required octane rating is used; actual concentrations are often lower than the permissible maximum. Historically, many post-WWII developed, low-powered 4- and 6-cylinder piston aircraft engines were designed to use leaded fuels; a suitable unleaded replacement fuel {{has not yet been}} developed and certified for most of these engines. , numerous certificated reciprocating-engine aircraft require high-octane (leaded) fuels. Teledyne-Continental Motors states: [...] "Current aircraft engines feature valve gear components which are designed for compatibility with the leaded ASTM D910 fuels. In such fuels, the lead acts as a lubricant, coating the contact areas between the <b>valve,</b> <b>guide,</b> and seat. The use of unleaded auto fuels with engines designed for leaded fuels can result in excessive exhaust valve seat wear {{due to the lack of}} lead. The result can be remarkable, with cylinder performance deteriorating to unacceptable levels in under 10 hours." [...] Lycoming has also provided a list of engines and fuels that are compatible with them. A number of their engines are not compatible with unleaded fuel according to their chart.|$|E
5000|$|A {{turbocharged}} {{direct injected}} (redubbed Spark Ignition Direct Injection) Ecotec {{was introduced in}} the 2007 Pontiac Solstice GXP and Saturn Sky Red Line. In these applications, the engine is mounted longitudinally. Displacement is 2.0 L——with a square 86 mm bore and stroke. Compression is 9.2:1 and maximum boost is 1.4 bar (20.0 psi), delivering [...] at 5300 rpm and [...] of torque from 2500 to 5250 rpm. Engine redline is at 6300 rpm and premium fuel is recommended. The sodium filled exhaust valves were based on technology developed for the Corvette V8 powertrains. The sodium fuses and becomes a liquid at idle, which improves conductivity and draws heat away from the valve face and <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> towards the stem to be cooled by the engine oil circulating in this area. The camshaft-driven direct injection systems pressurizes the fuel to 31 bar (450 psi) at idle, and up to 155 bar (2,250 psi) at wide-open throttle. The [...] "Gen II" [...] block is similar to the 2.4 L and also features VVT technology. The Gen II block was developed using data from racing programs and computer simulations. The bore walls and bulkheads were strengthened with a weight increase of 1 kg (2.5 pounds). The coolant jackets were expanded to improve heat transfer, resulting in a coolant capacity increase of 0.5 liters.|$|E
40|$|The {{researches}} {{have been}} carried out, where the object has been the set of two friction couples: valve stem – <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> and valve seat – seat insert. The camless driven valve has been common for each of such cases. The analyzed valve {{has been driven by}} magnetoelectrical drive. The special research stand has been elaborated and its scheme has been presented in the article. It has been measured the valve lift and valve acceleration, the impact force, the friction force, temperature values for <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> and for seat insert, sound level during impacting on the stand. The aim of researches has been to determine the dynamic parameters, the friction force between valve stem and <b>valve</b> <b>guide,</b> the impact force for valve impacting seat insert vs. frequency and valve lift. The analyzed valves have mated with seat inserts and valve guides made of cast iron, in oil absence. The valves have been made of TiAl 6 Zr 4 Sn 2 Mo 2 alloy. The researched friction couples have operated in temperature equal 293 K. The increase of frequency has resulted in small changes for values of lift and in greater changes of acceleration, during valve impact into its seat insert. The greatest values of impact force and acceleration have been for the small, middle and high values of valve lift, either. The ratio of impact force and valve acceleration has changed in thin bands. The friction force has decreased slightly with frequency increase and has decreased with valve lift increase. The sound level has increased with the frequency increase, and has not been dependent upon valve lift...|$|E
40|$|Taking {{advantage}} of {{the high degree of}} freedom in alloy design which is a distinctive feature of powder metallurgy, sintered alloys are widely applied to heat resistant and wear resistant parts. The main object products are <b>valve</b> <b>guides,</b> <b>valve</b> seat inserts, and exhaust system parts used in engines. Due to higher engine performance, which is one technology for responding to environmental problems in recent years, the service environments of these parts have become more severe, and improved performance in the wear resistance of materials and other properties is increasingly required. This review discusses recent technical trends in heat resistant/wear resistant sintered materials, with particular emphasis on materials...|$|R
2500|$|Valve gear {{was of the}} low-maintenance Baker type, with (of course) power reverse. A {{front-end}} throttle was installed, {{with the}} distinctive linkage running along the boiler on the engineer's side. [...] A mechanical lubricator, driven from the crosshead on the engineer's side, fed oil to the cylinders, <b>valves,</b> <b>guides</b> {{and other parts of}} the running gear. Many of the locomotives were fitted with a speedometer, which was attached to the engineer’s side frontmost leading axle.|$|R
5000|$|An {{advanced}} {{feature of}} the new Meteor engine was an invention to reduce valve failure, which they decided was caused by lateral vibration. A special design of upper and lower <b>valve</b> <b>guides,</b> without a centre section, meant that the valves had no fulcrum and into the central section they fitted a forked rocker pressed onto a shouldered valve stem. This effectively eliminated the 'rocking' action of the conventional top-end rocker and Vincent top ends set a new performance standard.|$|R
40|$|En el trabajo, se hace empleo de la herramienta de trabajo Análisis de la Causa Raíz (RCA) para {{llegar a}} unas primeras conclusiones acerca de fallos producidos en el nudo tribológico válvula – guía de válvula en un motor de combustión interna, y así pasar a hallar la causa final y dar solución al problema.

40|$|Abstract. the low {{pressure}} oil chamber {{and the high}} pressure oil chamber act directly on Both sides of the rotary valve. It will be large axial force to the valve body If the system working pressure is greater. The resulting outcome is low vibration frequency of the rotary valve driven hydraulic exciter. How to improve the hydraulic exciter frequency?We can improve {{the speed of the}} rotary valve or increase the number of rotary <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> groove. But if we increase the tank guided number,the diameter of the rotary valve spoo must be increased. Design a rotary valve without axial force can solve the problem of the rotary valve spool shaft size restricted. By calculation and analysis of the rotary valve spool suffered axial force. The work of a single rotary valve chamber pressure problems can be solved spool axial forc...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a project}} about the study of exhaust port flow for Proton 4 G 92 and Toyota 4 AGE {{cylinder}} head. It is a testing using SF- 1020 Air Flowbench machine {{that has been used}} to determine the air flow between the original exhaust port and modified exhaust port. In this study, an experiment approach has been performed to investigate the flow distribution of exhaust gases that will affect the performance of the engine by the design of exhaust port shape for cylinder head. The modification to the cylinder head such as eliminates the <b>valve</b> <b>guide,</b> porting and polishing has been done as a parameter during this experiment. Both cylinder heads are adapted with modification and it gives positive results of air flow increment for every modification applied. The highest air flow is in Proton 4 G 92 cylinder head and it improves the power and performance of the engine...|$|E
5000|$|The engine {{components}} {{were designed for}} ease of access and maintenance. The <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> and <b>valves</b> could be removed without removing the engine from the motorcycle. [...] The cylinder heads were integral with the engine. The intake and exhaust manifolds were cast as one piece such that the exhaust would heat the fuel mixture to improve fuel atomization. The engine had a large external flywheel {{on the left side}} similar to that on the horizontal single-cylinder Moto Guzzi.|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} {{design for}} the light duty diesel is an in-line four cylinder spark assisted diesel engine mounted transversely {{in the front of}} the vehicle. The engine has a one piece cylinder head, with one intake valve and one exhaust valve per cylinder. A flat topped piston is used with a cylindrical combustion chamber recessed into the cylinder head directly under the exhaust valve. A single ceramic insert is cast into the cylinder head to insulate both the combustion chamber and the exhaust port. A similar ceramic insert is cast into the head to insulate the intake port. A ceramic faceplate is pressed into the combustion face of the head to insulate the face of the head from hot combustion gas. The valve seats are machined directly into the ceramic faceplate for the intake valve and into the ceramic exhaust pot insert for the exhaust valve. Additional ceramic applications in the head are the use of ceramic <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> and ceramic insulated valves. The ceramic <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> are press fit into the head and are used for increased wear resistance. The ceramic insulated valves are conventional valves with the valve faces plasma spray coated with ceramic for insulation...|$|R
50|$|Early {{versions}} of the Speed Six engine suffered from poor valve train durability leading to many warranty claims against TVR. Subsequent third party development work has mitigated this issue by using revised material harnesses for the cam lobes, finger followers and <b>valve</b> <b>guides.</b> Softer <b>valve</b> springs and valves with thicker stems were also utilised. Engines that have had these modifications performed have much improved durability. Another third party development offers a redesigned cylinder head with cam and bucket valve actuation so eliminating the use of finger followers altogether.|$|R
40|$|Modification on {{intake port}} flow by {{enlarging}} the intake port area can increase engine performance. Higher {{air flow rate}} entered the intake port resulting higher air-fuel rate burn thus increased {{the performance of the}} engine. This report are consist of experiment of intake port flow between two cylinder head, Toyota 4 AGE 1. 6 L and Proton 4 G 92 1. 6 L. Modification works will be porting, polishing, removing both cylinder head are experimentally tested by opening valve lift with significant value by calculations using Superflow® SF- 1020 Flowbench machine. The experiment will consist of intake valve flow rate, the effect of velocity stack and swirl motion in bore. It is proved by experiment result that porting, polishing and removal <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> in the intake port area works significantly increased the flow into the engine and consequently changes the swirl speed to a higher values for both cylinder head and tremendous increased when the velocity stack is added along with the modification works...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Solenoid {{operated}} electromagnetic {{control valve}} (ECV) playing {{an important role}} for car’s air conditioning control system. ECV is used in external variable displacement swash plate type compressor and controls the entire air conditioning system {{by means of a}} pulse width modulation (PWM) input signal supplying from an external source (controller). Complete form of ECV contains number of internal features like valve body, core, <b>valve</b> <b>guide,</b> plunger, guide pin, plunger spring, bellows etc. While designing the ECV; dimensions of different internal items must meet the standard requirements as it is quite challenging. In this research paper, especially the dimensioning of ECV body and its three pressure ports through which the air/refrigerant passes are considered. Here internal leakage test analysis of ECV body is being carried out from its discharge port (Pd) to crankcase port (Pc) when the guide valve is placed inside it.

40|$|A {{study was}} made to reduce exhaust {{emissions}} and fuel consumption of a general aviation aircraft piston engine by applying known technology. Fourteen promising concepts such as stratified charge combustion chambers, cooling cylinder head improvements, and ignition system changes were evaluated for emission reduction and cost effectiveness. A combination of three concepts, improved fuel injection system, improved cylinder head with exhaust port liners and exhaust air injection was projected as the most cost effective and safe means of meeting the EPA standards for CO, HC and NO. The fuel economy improvement of 4. 6 % over a typical single engine aircraft flight profile does not though justify the added cost of the three concepts, and significant reductions in fuel consumption must {{be applied to the}} cruise mode where most of the fuel is used. The use of exhaust air injection in combination with exhaust port liners reduces exhaust valve stem temperatures which can result in longer <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> life. The use of exhaust port liners alone can reduce engine cooling air requirements by 11 % which is the equivalent of a 1. 5 % increase in propulsive power. The EPA standards for CO, HC and NO can be met in the IO- 520 engine using air injection alone or the Simmonds improved fuel injection system...|$|E
50|$|Superior air parts {{started as}} a {{manufacturer}} of <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> in 1967. The company branched out into FAA/PMA approved parts for general aviation aircraft. The company manufactures replacement parts for Lycoming and Continental aircraft engines. The cylinder assemblies use newer cylinder head alloys and fully hardened cylinder liners. Most of the company's production is outsourced, with Superior ensuring that the parts meet their engineering and testing standards. In 2008, Superior Air Parts parent company Thielert declared bankruptcy. Superior was sold to Superior Aviation Beijing (Qingdao Brantly Investment Group and Beijing Suyoupeirui Company).|$|R
