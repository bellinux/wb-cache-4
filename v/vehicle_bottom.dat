40|$|The {{pressure}} distribution on {{the bottom}} of an armored vehicle caused by a detonating explosive buried in soil has been long of interest in the community of the Armed Services. This experimental study discusses results from small-scale tests conducted to determine the distribution of pressure on target plates when subjected to loading due to the detonation of buried mines. A new methodology has been developed in order to measure the pressure - time profiles {{on the bottom}} of a vehicle. The tests are conducted by using water, saturated sand, and dry sand as the loading media. Different stand off distances are investigated using saturated sand. Kolsky bars and pressure sensors, on the target plate, are used to determine the free-field pressure - time profile of the output of the charge at any location for the <b>vehicle</b> <b>bottom.</b> For verification of the pressure results at certain distances, the specific impulse measured by utilizing different size round plates are employed. In order to investigate the loading mechanisms, high speed cameras are applied. The small-scale test results can be scaled to full scale by using verified scaling laws. The results of this research are of interest to the U. S NAVY and U. S ARMY in order to develop and evaluate computer codes which are mainly used in soil models. These computer codes are to be used to design mine resistant personnel carriers and in the field to predict the threat assessments...|$|E

In this paper, {{the numerical analysis}} results of an armoured vehicle loaded with blast wave are presented. Effects of ground proximity such as wave reflection are also taken into account. What is more, the tracking system was also included in calculations. The ground was modelled using Mie-Grüneisen equation of state. In the research an ALE coupling algorithm was used to model interaction between fluid (Euler domain) and structure (Lagrange domain). Euler description is used for air and blast wave propagation modelling, whereas structure is described by Lagrange equations of mass, momentum and energy conservation. The ALE coupling algorithm is implemented in MSC Dytran software. The problem was solved using explicit integration of movement equations over time.

5000|$|Travel is {{the measure}} of {{distance}} {{from the bottom of}} the suspension stroke (such as when the vehicle is on a jack and the wheel hangs freely) to the top of the suspension stroke (such as when the vehicle's wheel can no longer travel in an upward direction toward the <b>vehicle).</b> <b>Bottoming</b> or lifting a wheel can cause serious control problems or directly cause damage. [...] "Bottoming" [...] can be caused by the suspension, tires, fenders, etc. running out of space to move or the body or other components of the car hitting the road. The control problems caused by lifting a wheel are less severe if the wheel lifts when the spring reaches its unloaded shape than they are if travel is limited by contact of suspension members (See Triumph TR3B.) Many off-road vehicles, such as desert racers, use straps called [...] "limiting straps" [...] to limit the suspensions downward travel to a point within safe limits for the linkages and shock absorbers. This is necessary, since these trucks are intended to travel over very rough terrain at high speeds, and even become airborne at times. Without something to limit the travel, the suspension bushings would take all the force when the suspension reaches [...] "full droop", and it can even cause the coil springs to come out of their [...] "buckets" [...] if they are held in by compression forces only. A limiting strap is a simple strap, often nylon of a predetermined length, that stops the downward movement at a preset point before the theoretical maximum travel is reached. The opposite of this is the [...] "bump-stop", which protects the suspension and vehicle (as well as the occupants) from violent [...] "bottoming" [...] of the suspension, caused when an obstruction (or hard landing) causes the suspension to run out of upward travel without fully absorbing the energy of the stroke. Without bump-stops, a vehicle that [...] "bottoms out" [...] will experience a very hard shock when the suspension contacts the bottom of the frame or body, which is transferred to the occupants and every connector and weld on the vehicle. Factory vehicles often come with plain rubber [...] "nubs" [...] to absorb the worst of the forces, and insulate the shock. A desert race vehicle, which must routinely absorb far higher impact forces, may be provided with pneumatic or hydro-pneumatic bump-stops. These are essentially miniature shock absorbers (dampeners) that are fixed to the vehicle in a location such that the suspension will contact the end of the piston when it nears the upward travel limit. These absorb the impact far more effectively than a solid rubber bump-stop will, essential because a rubber bump-stop is considered a [...] "last-ditch" [...] emergency insulator for the occasional accidental bottoming of the suspension; it is entirely insufficient to absorb repeated and heavy bottomings such as a high-speed off-road vehicle encounters.|$|R

40|$|Cold-water coral mound {{morphology}} {{and development}} {{are thought to}} be controlled primarily by current regime. This study, however, reveals a general lack of correlation between prevailing bottom current direction and mound morphology (i. e. footprint shape and orientation), as well as current strength and mound size (i. e. footprint area and height). These findings are based on quantitative analyses of a high-resolution geophysical dataset collected with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle from three cold-water coral mound sites at the toe of slope of Great Bahama Bank. The three sites (80 km 2 total) have an average of 14 mounds km− 2, indicating that the Great Bahama Bank slope is a major coral mound region. At all three sites living coral colonies are observed {{on the surface of the}} mounds, documenting active mound growth. Morphometric analysis shows that mounds at these sites vary significantly in height (1 to 83 m), area (81 to 6 00 000 m 2), shape (mound aspect ratio 0 · 1 to 1) and orientation (mound longest axis 0 to 180 °). The Autonomous Underwater <b>Vehicle</b> measured <b>bottom</b> current data depict a north–south flowing current that reverses approximately every six hours. The tidal nature of this current and its intermittent deviations during reversals are interpreted to contribute to the observed mound complexity. An additional factor contributing to the variability in mound morphometrics is the sediment deposition rate that varies among and within sites. At most locations sedimentation rate lags slightly behind mound growth rate, causing mounds to develop into large structures. Where sedimentation rates are higher than mound growth rates, sediment partially or completely buries mounds. The spatial distribution and alignment of mounds can also be related to gravity mass deposits, as indicated by geomorphological features (for example, slope failure and linear topographic highs) in the three-dimensional bathymetry. In summary, variability in sedimentation rates, current regime and underlying topography produce extraordinarily high variability in the distribution, development and morphology of coral mounds on the Great Bahama Bank slope...|$|R
40|$|Multiuser {{underwater}} {{acoustic communication}} {{is one of}} the enabling technologies for the autonomous ocean-sampling network (AOSN). Multiuser communication allows <b>vehicles,</b> moorings, and <b>bottom</b> instruments to interact without human intervention to perform adaptive sampling tasks. In addition, multiuser communication may be used to send data from many autonomous users to one buoy with RF communications capability, which will then forward the information to shore. The two major signaling techniques for multiuser acoustic communication are phase-shift keying (PSK) direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS) and frequency-shift keying (FSK) frequency-hopped spread-spectrum (FHSS). Selecting between these two techniques requires not only a study of their performance under multiuser conditions, but also an analysis {{of the impact of the}} underwater acoustic channel. In the case of DSSS, limitations in temporal coherence of the channel affect the maximum spreading factor, leading to situations that may be better suited to FHSS signals. Conversely, the multipath resolving properties of DSSS minimize the effects of frequency-selective fading that degrade the performance of FSK modulation. Two direct-sequence receivers potentially suitable for the underwater channel are presented. The first utilizes standard despreading followed by decision-directed gain and phase tracking. The second uses chip-rate adaptive filtering and phase tracking prior to despreading. Results from shallow water testing in two different scenarios are presented to illustrate the techniques and their performance...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{environmental}} vehicle rating tools {{have been}} developed {{in order to promote}} the purchase and the use of greener cars. However those were developed/applied at a regional/country specific level. There is a need to develop a broader methodology that can be applied in a multi-country perspective for the assessment of the environmental rating of vehicles with alternative types of fuels as well as different types of drivetrain, such as electric, hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fuel cell hybrid. The environmental indicators usually relates to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), air pollutants emissions (HC, CO, NOx, PM, SOx) and noise levels. US rating methodology developed by ACEEE is guided by Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), but disregards noise impacts (scores vehicles from zero to 100 (best)). EcoScore Belgian methodology adopts a LCA perspective, disregarding the materials of vehicle impact, but giving some importance to the noise impact (scores from zero to 100 (best)). The German Verkehrsclub Deutschland's (VCD) current rating system does not purport to be an LCA, and it has been modified based on evolving views about the importance of various automobile impacts. VCD scores from 0 to 10 (best). It considers impacts in nature both from CO 2 (vehicle manufacturer information) and pollutants (European Standards), in human health from pollutants, also considers noise. Australian Green Vehicle Guide (GVG) rating methodology considers only usage stage, giving zero to 10 (best) points to GHG and air pollutants, disregarding noise. The overall rating is based on the sum of the air pollution and greenhouse ratings (zero to five star (best)). For the vehicle in-use emissions usually a non-realistic, standard, driving cycle is used and again differs from country to country, despite aiming at representing urban and extra-urban driving. This paper presents the application of the revised methodologies to existent alternative vehicle technologies, pure electric vehicle (Nissan Leaf), gasoline hybrid (Toyota Prius), plug-in hybrid (Toyota Prius), conventional gasoline (VW Beetle TSI), conventional diesel (VW Golf 2. 0 Bluemotion), where the urban and extra-urban driving is considered in the same fashion at a multi-country level.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} a magnetic anomaly guidance system that, {{with support from}} the Office of Naval Research, is being developed for fully autonomous detection, localization and classification of ferrous mines in Very Shallow Water/Surf Zone (VSW/SZ) environments. The magnetic guidance system’s hardware configurations and magnetic target signature processing methods specifically have been developed for autonomous guidance of small, maneuverable sensing platforms, such as Underwater <b>Bottom</b> <b>Vehicles,</b> (UBVs), to magnetic targets. The prototype magnetic anomaly guidance is a three-axis magnetometer-gradiometer comprised by an array of triaxial fluxgate magnetometers and triaxial accelerometers. This design allows development of magnetic gradient tensor contraction scalars that provide the basis for a unique method for magnetic guidance of UBVs to underwater and buried mines. The triaxial accelerometer array can be used for mitigation of the target-detection-range-reducing effects of large changes in sensor platform orientation. Field test results indicate that a simple magnetic guidance algorithm based on comparison of the magnitudes of contractions of gradient tensor subsets measured by “primary guidance axes ” of the sensor array will provide a robust and practical method for fully autonomous guidance of high- mobility UBVs to magnetic targets. Target detection range can be enhanced by using rotationally invariant tensor contractions for robust proximity sensing and “pseudo-robust ” scalar total field quantities for “homing in on ” magnetic targets. Sensor system stability and DLC performance also would be improved by the use of better, temperature-compensated magnetometers. The results indicate that the magnetic anomaly guidance system and its method for target localization are particularly appropriate for homing in on magnetic targets from high-mobility sensing platforms such a...|$|R
40|$|After {{the end of}} the Last Glacial Maximum, 450 km 2 {{of former}} {{terrestrial}} and coastal landscape of the Maltese Islands was drowned by the ensuing sea level rise. In this study we use high resolution seafloor data (multibeam echosounder data, seismic reflection profiles, and Remotely Operated <b>Vehicle</b> imagery) and <b>bottom</b> samples to reconstruct ~ 300 km 2 of this submerged Maltese paleolandscape. The observed paleolandscape is exceptionally well preserved and comprises former coastal landforms – (i) fault-related escarpments, (ii) paleoshore platforms and associated shorelines, (iii) paleoshoreline deposits, and (iv) mass movement deposits – and former terrestrial landforms – (v) river valleys, (vi) alluvial plains, (vii) karstified limestone plateaus, and (viii) sinkholes. These elements indicate that the paleolandscape has been primarily shaped by tectonic activity combined with fluvial, coastal, slope instability and karstic processes; these are the same processes the shaped the current terrestrial and coastal landscape. By correlating the identified landforms with the timing of known changes in sea level during the last glacial cycle, we infer that the alluvial plains and the shallowest limestone plateaus had up to 100 kyr to develop, whereas the paleoshoreline deposits are likely to have formed between 28 kyr and 14 kyr. The most prominent paleoshore platforms, shorelines and river valleys were generated between 60 kyr and 20 kyr. Fluvial erosion is likely to have been prevalent during periods of low sea level (Last Glacial Maximum and stadial conditions during MIS 3), whereas karst processes should have been more effective during warm and humid interstadial periods. Our results have implications for improving the characterization of past environments and climates, as well as providing a much needed background for prehistoric and geoarcheological research in the central Mediterranean region...|$|R

She also has two hydrographic winches, {{each of which}} can deploy 3,500 meters (11,480 feet) of 9.5-mm (3/8-inch) electromechanical cable, two trawl winches, {{each of which has}} a 35-metric-ton pull and can deploy 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) of 28.5-mm (1⅛-inch) warp wire, and a Gilson winch. She has a telescopic boom and an articulated boom, each with a lifting capacity of 8,000 pounds (3,629 kg. She has an A-frame on her starboard side and a large A-frame aft. The oceanographic winch and large after A-frame work in conjunction to serve her stern sampling station, while the two hydrographic winches work with the side A-frame to service her side sampling station, and the two hydrographic winches together give Pisces the capability to have three scientific packages ready for sequential operations. One of her hydrographic winches also can deploy lines and equipment over her stern. In addition to trawling, her sampling stations can deploy smaller sampling nets, longlines, and fish traps, and she has modified outriggers for shrimp trawling and gear testing. The hydrographic winches can deploy CTD instruments to measure the electrical conductivity, temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence of sea water. Pisces also can deploy specialized gear such as Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) frames, towed <b>vehicles,</b> dredges, and <b>bottom</b> corers, and she can deploy and recover both floating and bottom-moored sensor arrays. While trawling, Pisces uses wireless and hard-wired systems to monitor the shape of the trawl net and to work in conjunction with an autotrawl system that sets trawl depth and trawl wire tension and adjusts the net configuration.|$|R
