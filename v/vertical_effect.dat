30|$|The {{vertical}} {{characterization of}} a reservoir (Tompang and Kelkar 1988) {{is one of}} the most important considerations in reservoir simulation. The most accurate way to consider <b>vertical</b> <b>effects</b> is to use a 3 D reservoir simulator; however, due to the computational constraints discussed above for 3 D simulation, the use of 2 D simulators is an attractive alternative. As pointed out by Hearn (1971), 2 D reservoir simulation implies uniform reservoir properties and fluid saturation throughout the reservoir thickness, an assumption that surely is not physically correct. Thus, the input data require tuning to approximate the <b>vertical</b> <b>effects</b> (Hearn 1971). Dynamic pseudofunctions such as (Jacks et al. 1973, Kyte and Berry, 1975 and Stone 1991), flux weighted and pore volume weighted could be used to upscale relative permeability; however, these methods need fine grid simulation results. History matching using and tuning relative permeability curve using genetic algorithm is another way to approximate the <b>vertical</b> <b>effects.</b> However, this approach needs many simulation runs to fine-tune the relative permeability (Fayazi et al. 2016).|$|R

40|$|Evidence on the {{processes}} underlying the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> Simon <b>effect</b> is still controversial.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Rapid maxillary {{expansion}} (RME) for {{the treatment}} of maxillary deficiency and posterior crossbite may induce changes in the vertical dimension. Expanders with occlusal splints have been developed to minimize unwanted <b>vertical</b> <b>effects.</b> OBJECTIVE: This preliminary study used cephalometri radiographs to evaluate the <b>vertical</b> <b>effects</b> of RME using a Hyrax appliance in children with maxillary deficiency. METHOD: Twenty-six patients (11 boys; mean age = 8 years and 5 months) with maxillary deficiency and posterior crossbite were treated using a Hyrax appliance with an acrylic occlusal splint. Radiographs and cephalometric studies were performed before the beginning of the treatment (T 1) and after RME active time (T 2), at a mean interval of 7 months. Results were compared with normative values. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: At the end of treatment, there were no statistically significant changes, and measurements were similar to the normative values. Data showed that there were no significant <b>effects</b> on <b>vertical</b> growth, which suggests that appliances with occlusal splints may be used to correct transverse deficiencies regardless of the patient's growth pattern...|$|R

The skywalks that circle the structure {{were the first}} of its kind found on a parking center and was one of the few 'modern' parking facilities with a roof, a realistic and sensible solution given the climate of the region. The design separated pedestrian and automobile entrances and exits, a consideration not found on similar parking garages of the time period. Floors in the garage are sloped to allow for maximum parking spaces, the architect commented, “All the floors are sloping in this thing - parking structures aren't easy to design.” Light, long columns in the exterior design were used to create a <b>vertical</b> <b>effect.</b> Light arches, a 'working arch', creates a wide overhang at the top, protecting the white outer walls and shielding the structure from bad weather. A striking feature of the center is its sculptured tower extending 175 feet above the ground and far above the main structure. Its major function is housing the mechanisms for the passenger elevators. The tower also serves as a beacon to motorists, signaling a safe place to park their vehicles. And people were the center of the design claimed the architect Heylman, “There will be a news stand and outdoor restaurant with brightly colored umbrellas, a city ticket booth, and other pleasant facilities.

50|$|The Ministry of Finance of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Building, today a {{building}} of the Serbian government, is located in Belgrade, on {{the territory of the}} city municipality of Savski Venac, at 22 Kneza Miloša street. It is the work of Russian architect Nikolaj Petrovič Krasnov, the most important representative of the academic historicism in the Serbian interwar architecture. Due to the importance that the building has as an anthological work of Belgrade academic interwar architecture, it represents the immovable cultural property as the cultural monument. The building was constructed between 1926 and 1928, after the design by the architect Nikolay Krasnov, as the author of the original design of the building, and the later addition of the third floor from 1938. The building was constructed as the representative structure with the floor plan of irregularsquare and an inner courtyard. The dynamic facades, designed in the style of аcademism, have massive pilasters, between the first and the second floor windows. The emphasized projected cornices, window frames and pilasters with ring-shaped reinforcements give the facade a plastic liveliness and a monumental effect. The most luxurious is the corner part of the building, where the <b>vertical</b> <b>effect</b> is underlined by the dome with the bronze sculpture on its top - the personification of Yugoslavia. This sculpture, as well as other free standing sculptures on the facades of the building, Fertility with cornucopia, Crafts, Industry and Mercury were the works of a sculptor Đorđe Jovanović. The choice of motifs and the symbols of the facade sculptures was determined by the institution located in the building.|$|E

40|$|Recently van De Van, Creedy and Lambert (2001) and Urban and Lambert (2008) have reconsidered the {{original}} Aronson, Johnson and Lambert (1994) decomposition of the redistributive effect {{in order to}} identify the optimal bandwidth that should be used in decomposing the redistributive effect when groups with close pre-tax incomes are considered. The methodology proposed by van De Van, Creedy and Lambert (2001) suggests choosing as the optimal bandwidth the one which maximizes the ratio between the potential effect V (which depends on the bandwidth) and the actual redistributive effect RE (which is invariant). Urban and Lambert (2008) discuss a set of further possible decompositions of the redistributive effect together with a decomposition of the Atkinson-Plotnick-Kakwani index into three terms. In this paper we want to throw some more light on the behavior of three of the main decompositions analyzed by Urban and Lambert (2008) in order to look for criteria to choose a bandwidth which allows the three different definitions of potential redistributive effect to be assumed as coherent as possible values and, in the meanwhile, to catch as much as possible of the potential <b>vertical</b> <b>effect.</b> We suggest looking for the bandwidth where the ratio between the maximum distance among the different potential <b>vertical</b> <b>effect</b> definitions and the minimum among the different potential vertical effects is minimum.

40|$|Urban and Lambert (2005, 2008) {{present an}} {{exhaustive}} summary and an in-depth {{discussion of the}} literature contributions about the decomposition of the redistributive effect of a tax (RE). The authors discuss the indexes available in the literature for the potential <b>vertical</b> <b>effect</b> (V), the loss due to horizontal fairness violations (H) and that due to re-rankings (R); they also introduce new indexes specifically conceived {{to take into account}} problems arising when groups of exact equals are substituted by groups of close equals. Close equals groups are generally obtained by splitting the pre-tax income distribution into contiguous intervals having the same bandwidth, so that the problem of the bandwidth choice arises. van de Van, Creedy and Lambert (2001) suggest choosing the bandwidth that maximizes the potential <b>vertical</b> <b>effect</b> V. Even looking for V maximization, we discuss a new criterion that yields a compromise between the contrasting needs of minimizing the effects of pre-tax within groups inequalities and the minimization of group average re-rankings. The criterion is then applied to evaluate the components of two decompositions: the former is the one suggested by Urban and Lambert (2005, 2008) as preferable, the latter is suggested by us on the basis of Urban and Lambert’s paving discussion. According to our simulation results, when comparing different income tax systems for a same population as well as adopting the “optimal” bandwidth, the new criterion seems to introduce lower approximation errors than the maximization of V.
