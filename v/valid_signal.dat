It is typically located about 1 NM km inside {{the point where the}} glideslope intercepts the intermediate altitude and transmits a 400 Hz tone signal on a low-powered (3 watts), 75 MHz carrier signal. Its antenna is highly directional, and is pointed straight up. The <b>valid</b> <b>signal</b> area is a 2400 ft × 4200 ft ellipse (as measured 1000 ft above the antenna.)

40|$|Fast and {{accurate}} analysis of fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) images for signal counting will depend mainly upon two components: a classifier {{to discriminate between}} artifacts and <b>valid</b> <b>signals</b> of several fluorophores (colors), and well discriminating features to represent the signals. Our previous work {{has focused on the}} first component. To investigate the second component, we evaluate candidate feature sets by illustrating the probability density functions (pdfs) and scatter plots for the features. The analysis provides first insight into dependencies between features, indicates the relative importance of members of a feature set, and helps in identifying sources of potential classification errors. Class separability yielded by different feature subsets is evaluated using the accuracy of several neural network (NN) -based classification strategies, some of them hierarchical, as well as using a feature selection technique making use of a scatter criterion. The complete analysis recommends several intensity and hue features for representing FISH signals. Represented by these features, around 90 % of <b>valid</b> <b>signals</b> and artifacts of two fluorophores are correctly classified using the NN. Although applied to cytogenetics, the paper presents a comprehensive, unifying methodology of qualitative and quantitative evaluation of pattern feature representation essential for accurate image classification.

Chamberlain claims that the rolling code system makes it unlikely for a burglar to send a <b>valid</b> <b>signal</b> by replaying the recorded one. With rolling code protection, a garage door will open if and only if the transmitted code is not among the last 1024 used codes and it is among the next 4096 codes. The Security+ has additional functionality that will cause the GDO to resynchronize when two signals out of the acceptable range are transmitted in rapid succession. This was added in the case that homeowners use the same transmitter on multiple garage doors.|$|E

Next, {{if the results}} are valid, then the <b>valid</b> <b>signal</b> is asserted to start incrementing the counter, and to start loading the results to the FIFO buffer. In this case, the counter is incremented if the multiplier <b>valid</b> <b>signal</b> is asserted (high), the counter is decremented if the adder <b>valid</b> <b>signal</b> is asserted; and the counter is on hold if both the valid signals are asserted or de-asserted (low) simultaneously.

40|$|AbstractEnergy {{performance}} labelling {{and certification}} {{have been introduced}} widely to address market failures affecting the uptake of energy efficient technologies, by providing a signal to support decision making during contracting processes. The UK has recently introduced the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) as a signal of building energy performance. The aims of this article are: to evaluate how <b>valid</b> EPC’s are <b>signals</b> of occupier satisfaction with office facilities; and to understand whether occupant attitudes towards environmental issues have affected commercial office rental values. This was achieved by surveying occupant satisfaction with their workplaces holistically using a novel multi-item rating scale which gathered 204 responses. Responses to this satisfaction scale were matched with the corresponding EPC and rental value of occupier’s workplaces. The satisfaction scale {{was found to be}} both a reliable and valid measure. The analysis found that EPC asset rating correlates significantly with occupant satisfaction with all facility attributes. Therefore, EPC ratings may be considered <b>valid</b> <b>signals</b> of overall facility satisfaction within the survey sample.
