30|$|As the {{traditional}} Si-based technology gradually reaches the minimize limitation, many {{efforts have been}} made in the novel nanostructures or low-dimensional materials [1 – 7]. Among these prominent issues, transistors composed of nanoscale vacuum channels or known as the nanogap have been steadily attracting attentions [8 – 10]. Distinct from the early vacuum tubes with high-power consumption and difficulty for high integration, the nanogap structures are more prospective for the modern nanoelectronics. For conventional field effect transistors (FETs), the carriers may collide with the optical and acoustic phonons during the transport. Also, intrinsic graphene-based FETs were found to have an on–off current ratio less than 10 due to the lack of a bandgap, which are not suitable for modern integrated logic circuits. Intrinsically, electrons could ballistically travel through the nanoscale <b>vacuum</b> <b>channel</b> while suffering from collision or scattering in the semiconductors. And the vacuum nano-devices could be compatible with standard silicon process and combine the advantages of ballistic transport with miniaturization and integration. Thus, the nanoscale <b>vacuum</b> <b>channel</b> transistors (NVCTs) may output high frequency [9, 11], on/off ratio [12], or fast temporal response [13] with low working voltage. More importantly, the NVCT is proved to retain the advantages of {{the traditional}} vacuum tubes that operate normally in the extreme conditions, like exposure of ionizing radiation or high temperature [8]. The development of manufacturing technology can open up enormous opportunities for creating nanoscale <b>vacuum</b> <b>channel,</b> which might be compatible with modern integrated circuit (IC).|$|E

30|$|As a result, many {{attempts}} have been made to downscale the <b>vacuum</b> <b>channel</b> into nanogap and construct three terminal junctions. For instance, the vertical structure was widely utilized in the traditional vacuum electronic devices [14, 15]. Researchers have proposed different types of vertical NVCTs, where the electrons could emit directly out of plane, e.g., the slit-type vacuum transistor [16], or the Spindt-type NVCT [17]. However, the vertical structure could hardly be compatible with CMOS process. Compared with up–down structure, the planar NVCT are more prospective for future integration as the nanogap is variable with mask layout, including electron beam lithography (EBL) [18], focused ion beam (FIB) [19], or nanoimprinting [20]. Recently, planar-type vacuum transistors with nanogap channel have been fabricated with traditional semiconductor processing. Meyyappan et al. demonstrated a back-gate vacuum nano-channel transistor with standard silicon semiconductor processing, showing high-frequency switching characteristics with negligible leakage current [9]. In order to enhance the gate controllability, they further fabricated a surround-gate NVCT consists of sub- 50 -nm <b>vacuum</b> <b>channel,</b> and the device was proven to stand against ionizing radiation (proton and Gamma ray) and high temperature (200  °C) [8]. Wei et al. successfully fabricated a graphene-based vacuum transistor with better electrical performance than those graphene-based solid-state transistors. With superior on/off current ratio and low working voltages, the graphene NVCT are expected to be applied in severe environments such as electromagnetic radiation or extreme temperature [12]. Our previous work also precisely fabricated sub- 30  nm aligned nanogap arrays with a well-controlled process [21]. The experimental results above indicate that the vacuum nano-devices, composed of the nanoscale <b>vacuum</b> <b>channel,</b> have the advantages of high response speed, low operating voltage, and superior switching performance and, more importantly, could be compatible with standard silicon process and combine the advantages of ballistic transport with miniaturization and integration. In particular, the nano-channel that smaller than the mean free path of electron can behave as vacuum without scattering or collision. Thus, the NVCT may function in low vacuum environment or even atmosphere, paving the way for a new generation of high performance, high-speed and low-cost vacuum electronic devices.|$|E

40|$|Air {{entrapment}} during diecasting {{die filling}} {{is a major}} problem that causes most rejects, after quality inspection, due to unattended and dangerous gas porosity, especially in high performance and structural parts. In the past years, many technologies were developed in order to reduce air entrapment during filling; among them, optimal results were mainly obtained by active (vacuum) and passive (chill vents) air evacuation systems. Nevertheless, only small knowledge on how to optimize dies design for those technologies is available for the die maker. In the same way, at now, many casting simulation software lacks in this specific field and today ventings, <b>vacuum</b> <b>channels</b> and chill vents are designed according to proprietary formulas and, mainly, experience. In order to understand what happens to air inside a die cavity before and during metal injection, an analytical model was developed to calculate and forecast air pressure and flow through vents. This model takes into account, in a very detailed way, all the phenomena that occurs during injection, with particular relevance to process parameters (injection speeds and strokes, temperatures, vacuum pressures…) as well as flow-related phenomena that can impact on air escape, like premature vents clogging. This mathematical model was then validated and optimized through extensive casting trials in different venting simulation (with vacuum, only vents, chill vents, no air escape…) on different casting shapes and with different process parameters. The model allows to the die designer to optimize vents and related operating process parameters, simulate and compare different air evacuation solutions and forecast the mean gas porosity fraction in the casting with a calculation time of only few seconds. Calculations were useful to demonstrate the influence of process parameters on air trapping and the main result was that venting (with or without vacuum) is ineffective without an optimal setup of casting parameters and a correct air escape area calculation...|$|R

The study is applied to the specifications available at present time, or planned for the near future, of the Ti:Sa Frascati Laser for Acceleration and Multidisciplinary Experiments (FLAME) in Frascati. Novel nonlinear equation is derived by a three-timescale description, with an intermediate timescale associated with the nonlinear phase of the laser wave. They describe on an equal footing both the strong and moderate laser intensity regimes, pertinent to the core and the edges of the pulse. These have fundamentally different dispersive properties since, in the core, the electrons are almost completely expelled by a very strong ponderomotive force and the electromagnetic wave packet is imbedded in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>channel</b> and has (almost) linear properties, while at the pulse edges the laser amplitude is smaller and the wave is dispersive. The nonlinear phase provides a transition to a nondispersive electromagnetic wave at large intensities and the saturation of the previously known nonlocal cubic nonlinearity, without the violation of the imposed scaling laws. The temporal evolution of the laser pulse is studied by the numerical solution of the model equations in a two-dimensional geometry, with the spot diameter presently used in the self-injection test experiment (SITE) with FLAME. The most stable initial pulse length is found to be around 1 μm, which is several times shorter than presently available.

40|$|Quantum {{versions}} of control problems are typically {{more difficult than}} their classical counterparts because of additional constraints imposed by quantum mechanics. In coherent quantum controller synthesis and optimization problems, the controller is required to be a physically realizable quantum system. This means that the equations describing the synthesized quantum controller must correspond to a meaningful quantum system. A tractable approach to such problems is to use established classical controller synthesis methods to obtain a classical solution and then modify this solution by introducing quantum <b>vacuum</b> noise <b>channels</b> to obtain a physically realizable quantum controller. Quantum <b>vacuum</b> noise <b>channels</b> in the controller place limits on the achievable controller performance. Hence it is desirable to minimize the number of these noises. The aim of this thesis is to improve on existing methods for implementing physically realizable quantum systems. We give a method to implement a strictly proper, linear time invariant system as a physically realizable quantum system. This method introduces a minimal number of quantum vacuum noises. We also give a condition, under which a strictly proper transfer function can be implemented as a physically realizable quantum system, where the number of introduced quantum noises {{is equal to the}} output dimension. Singular perturbation approximations are closely related to adiabatic elimination, a common technique within the physics literature for modeling quantum systems. We give two results concerning the physical realizability of the reduced dimension approximate system obtained from singular perturbation approximation. Coherent quantum observers represent an important building block in developing systematic and tractable approaches to coherent control problems. We give three algorithms for the design of coherent quantum observers and incorporate novel refinements in an attempt to improve performance. In the coherent quantum linear quadratic Gaussian problem, the separation principle of combining an optimal state estimator and an optimal regulator to obtain an optimal controller does not apply. This is due to the quantum noises introduced to obtain a physically realizable controller. Taking this into account, we give an algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution for the coherent quantum linear quadratic Gaussian problem...|$|R

The study is applied to a laser wakefield acceleration scheme with specifications that may {{be available in the}} next generation of Ti:Sa lasers and with the use of recently developed pulse compression techniques. A set of novel nonlinear equations is derived using a three-timescale description, with an intermediate timescale associated with the nonlinear phase of the electromagnetic wave and with the spatial bending of its wave front. They describe, on an equal footing, both the strong and the moderate laser intensity regimes, pertinent to the core and to the edges of the pulse. These have fundamentally different dispersive properties since in the core the electrons are almost completely expelled by a very strong ponderomotive force, and the electromagnetic wave packet is imbedded in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>channel,</b> thus having (almost) linear properties.
