40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of {{positive}} fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> on dividend policy. If fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> are transitory in nature and managers are able to assess their implications for future earnings, fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> in net income is expected to have no distribution consequences. However, positive fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> may lead to higher dividends when management incorrectly assesses their persistence. This can have a procyclical impact because higher dividends increase leverage, and thus risk. We use a Russian setting that mandates fair value accounting for financial instruments and requires disclosure of unrealised fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> in income. We find no empirical support for the concern that dividends increase in response to positive fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Rather, there is a negative relationship between positive fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> and dividend changes, which holds after controlling for dividend policy determinants and any endogenous nature of the revaluation decision. We discuss several possible explanations for this finding...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical thesis. Bibliography: pages 62 - 67. Chapter 1. Introduction [...] Chapter 2. Theoretical {{framework}} [...] Chapter 3. Literature {{review and}} hypothesis development [...] Chapter 4. Research design [...] Chapter 5. Results [...] Chapter 6. Conclusion. This study examines {{the effect of}} fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> on firms' dividend distributions under two alternate dividend law settings, i. e. profit-test-based dividend law and net-assets-test based dividend law. This is important because both firms' dividend policy and fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> have an association with reported earnings. The study {{contributes to the literature}} by combining two variables, namely dividend law and fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments,</b> to examine firms' dividend policy. Specifically, this thesis hypothesises that, (1) positive fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> have no distribution consequences under profit-test-based dividend law; and (2) that such adjustments are distributed under net-assets-test-based dividend law. The study uses Fama and Babiak's (1968) variation of Lintner's (1956) model and a sample of 185 ASX-listed financial sector firms with 1, 496 firm-year observations to test the two hypotheses. The sample period of nine financial years from 2005 − 06 to 2013 − 14 enables an analysis in both dividend law settings because Australia changed from profit-test-based dividend law to net-assets-test-based dividend law in July 2010. Under the profit-test-based dividend law, contrary to the expectations, the results show that positive fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> are distributed. Managers' inability to differentiate between persistent and transitory fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> amid non-consideration of transitory nature of fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments,</b> while setting dividend policy, provide some explanation of the results. Under the net-assets-test-based dividend law, the study expects, but did not find any effect of positive fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> on firms' dividend payouts. Firms' preference to pursue conservative dividend policy and to attach dividend payouts with permanent earnings, provide some explanation of the findings. The results show that the statutory detachment of earnings and dividends under net-assets-test-based dividend law has not affected the conventional link between these two variables.

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of upward fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> on {{dividend}} policies in Russia, where corporate governance is weak. We discuss the case of the utility company Unified Energy System (UES), which abolished its dividends (including mandatory preferred dividends) after reporting a record profit resulting from fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments.</b> In a large sample of Russian firms, we find a negative relationship between upward fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> and dividend changes. We suggest that fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> may introduce noise and inhibit decision making because users may have difficulties in assessing the distribution relevance of the income components. In low investor protection countries, where outsiders generally lack the power to press corporate insiders to distribute cash, this may be seized upon by corporate insiders to adjust dividends downwards. Thus, introducing fair value accounting has corporate governance implications, and it may lead to outcomes that are detrimental to the interests of outsiders...|$|R

50|$|Technical Specifications 3GPP TS 05.10 and TS 45.010 {{describe}} the TA <b>value</b> <b>adjustment</b> procedures. The TA value is normally between 0 and 63, {{with each step}} representing an advance of one bit period (approximately 3.69 microseconds). With radio waves travelling at about 300,000,000 metres per second (that is 300 metres per microsecond), one TA step then represents a change in round-trip distance (twice the propagation range) of about 1,100 metres. This means that the TA value changes for each 550-metre change in the range between a mobile and the base station. This limit of 63 × 550 metres is the maximum 35 kilometres that a device can be from a base station and is the upper bound on cell placement distance.|$|E
50|$|There is {{an amount}} {{guaranteed}} to be paid out called the sum assured and this can be increased {{on the basis of}} investment performance through the addition of periodic (for example annual) bonuses. Regular bonuses (sometimes referred to as reversionary bonuses) are guaranteed at maturity and a further non-guarantee bonus may be paid at the end known as a terminal bonus. During adverse investment conditions, the encashment value or surrender value may be reduced by a 'Market Value Reduction' or MVR (It is sometime referred to as a market <b>value</b> <b>adjustment</b> but this is a term in decline through pressure from the Financial Conduct Authority to use clearer terms). The idea of such a measure is to protect the investors who remain in the fund from others withdrawing funds with notional values that are, or risk being, in excess of the value of underlying assets at a time when stock markets are low. If an MVA applies an early surrender would be reduced according to the policies adopted by the funds managers at the time.|$|E
30|$|Figure  6 {{depicts the}} sample {{path of the}} VA process using the first interpolating {{function}} (left panels) for the five different CSA specifications (top to bottom), while the other figures show {{the differences in the}} VA due to the different interpolating functions. The differences in the VA are one order of magnitude smaller than the differences in prices, however, the VA itself is an order of magnitude smaller than the basis swap price. Reflecting the situation for the prices, the largest discrepancies between VAs using the first and the other two interpolating functions occur around the curved section of the manifold. However, the discrepancies in the VA in the flat sections of the manifold are more pronounced than the corresponding discrepancies in prices. The reason is that the interpolation affects <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> both via the basis swap price and via the short rate used for discounting, and its effect is propagated in different segments through the backward regression. This becomes clear when one looks at the differences between prices and <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> stemming from using the second and third interpolating functions; although the difference in prices is flat zero, the difference in <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> is far from zero.|$|R

30|$|This {{methodology}} {{allows us}} to compute option prices and <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> consistently since we only have to calibrate the discrete-tenor affine LIBOR model, while {{the dynamics of the}} short rate process, which is essential in the computation of the VA, follows from the interpolation. In particular, we do not need to introduce and calibrate (or estimate) an “exogenous” model for the short rate, as is done in other approaches. The interpolating function thus plays a crucial role in our methodology, since this is the only “free‘” ingredient once the affine LIBOR model has been calibrated. At the same time, it introduces an element of model risk, through the different possible choices of interpolating functions. In the sequel, we are going to examine the impact of different interpolating functions on the <b>value</b> <b>adjustments.</b>|$|R
