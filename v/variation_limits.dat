Properly designed systems can also recognize when their algorithms cannot make a reliable identification and refer that image to a specialist (whose address can be accessed from another database). Such systems can also include elements of artificial intelligence and so improve their performance the more they are used.

40|$|Abstract: When {{tension is}} applied to steel tendons they {{elongate}} {{in proportion to the}} tensile force, as predicted by Hooke’s law. This elongation is used by the South African standard on concrete structural works (SANS 2001 -CC 1) and South African standard specification for road and bridgeworks (COLTO) to determine the adequacy of the force applied in a tendon. The standards prescribe an elongation <b>variation</b> <b>limit</b> of ± 6 % and an average elongation <b>variation</b> <b>limit</b> of ± 3 %.

40|$|A {{statistical}} metrology {{framework is}} used to identify systematic and random sources of interconnect structure (ILD thickness) variation. Electrical and physical measurements, TCAD simulations, design of experiments, signal processing, and statistical analysis are integrated via statistical metrology to deconvolve ILD thickness variation into constituent variation sources. In this way, insight into planarization variation is enabled; for a representative CMP process we find that dielevel neighborhood interactions are comparable to die-level feature-dependent effects, and within each die, die-level variation is greater than wafer-level variation. The characterization of variation sources via statistical metrology is critical for improved process control, interconnect simulation, and robust circuit design.

We present computer simulations of a simple feedback system in which active optical elements, set to maximize the sharpness, correct most of the atmospheric distortion. Photon statistics set the limiting magnitude of the object for which a practical feedback system can work. Details in a sixth magnitude object smaller than 0. 1 sec of arc should be resolvable.
