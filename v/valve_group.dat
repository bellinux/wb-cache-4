Our aim was to compare the risk of late aortic events after isolated aortic valve replacement surgery for bicuspid versus tricuspid aortic valve stenosis with concomitant mild to moderate dilatation of the proximal aorta. MethodsA total of 325 consecutive patients (60 % males; mean age, 59. 5 Â± 10 years) with aortic valve stenosis and concomitant ascending aortic dilatation of 40 to 50 mm underwent isolated aortic valve replacement from 1995 through 2000. A total of 153 patients (47 %) were diagnosed with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis (bicuspid aortic <b>valve</b> <b>group),</b> whereas the remaining 172 patients (53 %) had tricuspid aortic valve stenosis (tricuspid aortic <b>valve</b> <b>group).</b> Follow-up (3566 patient-years) was 100 % complete. Adverse aortic events were defined as the need for proximal aortic surgery or the occurrence of aortic dissection/rupture or sudden death during follow-up.

40|$|Background. With {{the rapid}} growth of the elderly segment of the population, more octogenarians are re-ferred for complex cardiac interventions, {{including}} reop-erations. Data regarding the outcomes, quality of life, and long-term results after reoperative open-heart surgi-cal procedures in octogenarians are scarce. Methods. We retrospectively studied 113 consecutive octogenarians (mean age, 83 6 2. 6 years) who underwent reoperative cardiac procedures within a 13 -year period. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was performed in 49 patients (CABG group), valvular procedures (aortic, mitral, or tricuspid valve, alone or in combination) in 35 (<b>valve</b> <b>group),</b> and combined CABG and valve interven-tion in 29 (combined CABG and <b>valve</b> <b>group).</b> Results. The 30 -day mortality rate was 8 % (4 of 49) for the CABG group, 9 % (3 of 35) for the <b>valve</b> <b>group,</b> and 17 % (5 of 29) for the combined CABG and <b>valve</b> <b>group.</b> One- and 5 -year actuarial survival rates were, respec-tively, 85 % 6 5 % and 58 % 6 10 % for the CABG group, 78 % 6 7 % and 53 % 6 12 % for the <b>valve</b> <b>group,</b> and 69 % 6 9 % and 63 % 6 10 % for the combined CABG and <b>valve</b> <b>group.</b> Sixty-one percent of patients in the CABG group, 40 % in the <b>valve</b> <b>group,</b> and 38 % in the combined CABG and <b>valve</b> <b>group</b> were in New York Heart Association class I or II postoperatively at a mean follow-up time of 2. 1 6 2. 4 years.

Methods: From 1982 to 1994, 670 patients underwent isolated aortic valve replacement and 310 underwent isolated mitral valve replacement with the Hancock II bioprosthesis (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, Minn). Mean age was 65 Â± 12 years in both groups. Most patients were in New York Heart Association functional classes III or IV, and concomitant coronary artery disease was present in 44 % of patients in the aortic <b>valve</b> <b>group</b> and 41 % of patients in the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>group.</b> Patients were followed up prospectively at periodic intervals.

MethodsSince 1990, a total of 787 CarboMedics valves have been implanted in 694 patients for aortic valve replacement, including 19 redo cases in 220 patients; for mitral valve replacement, including 108 redo cases in 381 patents; and for double (aortic and mitral) valve replacement, including 29 redo cases in 93 patients. The follow-up data were complete for 7201 patient-years in 99. 3 % of the patients. ResultsThe hospital mortality rate of the aortic, mitral, and double <b>valve</b> replacement <b>groups</b> was 0. 9 %, 3. 7 %, and 4. 3 %, respectively. The corresponding freedom from valve-related morbidity rates in each group were 66. 0 %, 40. 6 %, and 48. 0 % at 20 years (PÂ =Â . 0206). A higher incidence of paravalvular leakage was observed in the mitral and double <b>valve</b> replacement <b>groups</b> than in the aortic <b>valve</b> replacement <b>group</b> (PÂ =Â . 0019).

40|$|AbstractDobutamine stress Doppler {{echocardiography}} {{was used}} to compare the hemodynamic performance of two small aortic bileaflet prostheses. Nineteen patients (14 female, mean age 64 years) who had undergone aortic valve replacement with 21 mm bileaflet valve prostheses (St. Jude Medical valve, n = 9, or CarboMedics valve, n = 10) were studied. Dobutamine infusion was started at a rate of 5 Î¼g Â· kg- 1 Â· min- 1 and increased to 10 and 20 Î¼g Â· kg- 1 Â· min- 1 at 15 -minute intervals. Under maximum stress, heart rate and cardiac output increased by 70 % and 120 %, respectively, and mean arterial blood pressure decreased by 9 %. Pulsed-wave and continuous-wave Doppler studies were performed at rest {{and at the end of}} each stage. Velocity ratio, effective orifice area, performance index, and discharge coefficient of the valve were calculated, and peak and mean velocities and pressure drops across the prostheses were measured. Dobutamine infusion produced similar increases in cardiac output in all patients. Effective orifice areas, discharge coefficients, and performance indexes were comparable for the two <b>valve</b> <b>groups</b> both at rest and maximum stress. Transvalvular velocities and pressure drops were also similar in the two <b>valve</b> <b>groups.</b> Transvalvular pressure drops were also comparable in patients with large body surface area. Dobutamine stress echocardiography is useful in the evaluation of the hemodynamic performance of prosthetic heart valves.

40|$|This thesis {{starts from}} the {{recognition}} that a hydronic heating system can be optimised, but can never be totally perfect. Sooner or later, in practice, deviations - caused {{by one or more}} components having slightly different characteristics or settings than they are assumed or supposed to have - arise. The aim of this work is to show how system design affects the overall sensitivity to deviations, in terms of the effect on performance and return water temperature. The systems that have been analysed are radiator systems and air heaters controlled by <b>valve</b> <b>groups,</b> both supplied by heat from district heating. In particular, the analysis has been concentrated on differences between high-flow and low-flow systems. Based on fundamental theory in this area, as well as on physical measurements made in test rigs, models have been developed and/or applied in order to investigate system function in the desired manner. The effect of deviations have then been shown and quantified, using results from simulations. The simulations show that thermostatic radiator valves are most effective in low-flow systems. Low-flow systems, too, produce the lowest return temperatures. However, incorrect or changed radiator valve settings can result in substantial increased return temperature and differences in room temperatures in such systems. A direct connection of an air heater (that is without recirculation) presents the least risk of control instability, which means that performance tends to be more stable. In this respect, there is no difference whether the system is balanced for a high flow or a low flow. However, balancing does have a considerable effect on the control performance of <b>valve</b> <b>groups</b> with a recirculation connection and with low-flow systems running a greater risk of instability...|$|R
40|$|Surgery {{remains the}} primary form of {{treatment}} for infective endocarditis (IE). However, {{it is not clear}} what type of prosthetic valve provides a better prognosis. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the prognosis of infective endocarditis treated with biological valves to cases treated with mechanical valves. Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched from January 1960 to November 2016. Randomized controlled trials, retrospective cohorts and prospective studies comparing outcomes between biological valve and mechanical valve management for infective endocarditis were analyzed. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale(NOS) was used to evaluate the quality of the literature and extracted data, and Stata 12. 0 software was used for the meta-analysis. A total of 11 publications were included; 10, 754 cases were selected, involving 6776 cases of biological valves and 3, 978 cases of mechanical valves. The all-cause mortality risk of the biological <b>valve</b> <b>group</b> was higher than that of the mechanical <b>valve</b> <b>group</b> (HR = 1. 22, 95 % CI 1. 03 to 1. 44, P = 0. 023), as was early mortality (RR = 1. 21, 95 % CI 1. 02 to 1. 43, P = 0. 033). The recurrence of endocarditis (HR = 1. 75, 95 % CI 1. 26 to 2. 42, P = 0. 001), as well as the risk of reoperation (HR = 1. 79, 95 % CI 1. 15 to 2. 80, P = 0. 010) were more likely to occur in the biological <b>valve</b> <b>group.</b> The incidence of postoperative embolism was less in the biological <b>valve</b> <b>group</b> than in the mechanical <b>valve</b> <b>group,</b> but this difference was not statistically significant (RR = 0. 90, 95 % CI 0. 76 to 1. 07, P = 0. 245). For patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), there was no significant difference in survival rates between the biological <b>valve</b> <b>group</b> and the mechanical <b>valve</b> <b>group</b> (HR = 0. 91, 95 % CI 0. 68 to 1. 21, P = 0. 520). The results of our meta-analysis suggest that mechanical valves can provide a significantly better prognosis in patients with infective endocarditis. There were significant differences in the clinical features of patients receiving a biological valve compared to patients receiving a mechanical valve. A large, multicenter retrospective study included in our meta-analysis suggested that any mortality risk of the biological <b>valve</b> <b>group</b> was significant higher than that of the mechanical <b>valve</b> <b>group.</b> However, the risk was no different after risk was adjusted. So, we thought the reason for this result may be related to the characteristics of the patient rather than valve dysfunction.

40|$|Background Transcatheter {{aortic valve}} {{implantation}} and rapid-deployment aortic valve replacement represent two emerging therapies {{for patients with}} intermediate surgical risk and severe aortic stenosis. However, head-to-head comparisons between such novel therapies are lacking. Methods Severe aortic stenosis patients with intermediate surgical risk treated with rapid-deployment valve replacement at our institution were identified and compared with a propensity-matched population of patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Postoperative echocardiographic findings, in-hospital and midterm clinical outcomes were compared. Results We identified 60 patients who received transcatheter (n = 30) or rapid-deployment (n = 30) valve replacement. On postoperative echocardiography, freedom from paravalvular regurgitation was higher in the rapid-deployment <b>valve</b> <b>group</b> (p < 0. 001), while postoperative mean transprosthetic gradient was lower in the transcatheter <b>valve</b> <b>group</b> (p = 0. 03).

Conclusions Transcatheter and rapid-deployment valve replacement are promising treatment options for patients with intermediate surgical risk. These two techniques are associated with specific patterns of prosthesis function and postoperative complications. Further evaluation of the clinical impact of these therapies in this patient population is needed...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesWe report our {{two years}} clinical, and echo follow up of {{patients}} who underwent trans-apical and trans-femoral TAVI. MethodsAll patients who underwent TAVI therapy have been followed at six, 12, and 24 months, where clinical, and echo evaluation have been obtained. ResultsSixty-six pat were operated, with mean age of 78. 7 Â± 9. 3 y, 53 % females, and 47 % males. The mean logistic Euro score was 21 Â± 8. 55 % of pat completed 2 years follow-up. Fourty-two pat received Edward Sapien valve (25 trsna-apical, and 17 trans-femoral), and 24 pat received core valve. Thirty days mortality in Sapien <b>valve</b> <b>group</b> was 11 %, and 0 % in Core <b>valve</b> <b>group.</b> CVA developed in 8 % of the core <b>valve</b> <b>group,</b> and 7 % of the Sapien <b>valve</b> <b>group.</b> Complete heart block developed in 37. 5 of Core group, and 4. 8 % of the sapien group. Peripheral arterial complications occurred in 12. 5 % of Core patients, and 5. 8 % of Sapien patients. On follow up, patientâs symptoms improved. The PG decreased from 88 Â± 22 mmHg to 19 Â± 7 mmHg, P< 0. 0001, and the mitral regurgitation (MR) severity grade decreased from 1. 6 Â± 1. 1 to 0. 9 Â± 0. 6, P< 0. 001. Paravalvular leak was mild in 15. 2 %, and moderate in 6. 1 % of patients. ConclusionTAVI is promising technique in treating patients with severe AS with acceptable mortality rate. There was significant improvement in patientâs symptoms, reduction in aortic gradient and reduction in MR severity...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: To {{assess the}} extent and pattern of {{regression}} of left ventricular hypertrophy after valve replacement for aortic stenosis, we studied 26 patients receiving either 19 or 21 mm CarboMedics <b>valves</b> (<b>group</b> I, 13 patients) or either 23 or 25 mm CarboMedics <b>valves</b> (<b>group</b> II, 13 patients). The studies were done before the operation and after 3 years, and results were {{compared with those of}} 10 control patients. Methods: Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters and volumes, ejection fraction and fractional shortening, and interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness were measured. The ratio between interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness, the ratio between left ventricular wall thickness and left ventricular chamber radius, and the left ventricular mass were then calculated. Results: At follow-up there was a significant reduction in the left ventricular mass, interventricular septum, and posterior wall thickness for both patient groups (p < 0. 01). However, only the posterior wall thickness reached normal values; the interventricular septum and the left ventricular mass indices were still significantly greater than in the control group (p < 0. 01). Because of the incomplete regression of interventricular septal hypertrophy, the ratio between interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness was similar between both patient groups but it was significantly higher than in control subjects (p < 0. 01). The ratio between wall thickness and chamber radius did not decrease significantly in group II patients, in whom it remained above the control values. Conclusion: Having a bileaflet aortic prosthesis of one size larger did not seem to significantly influence the pattern and the extent of regression of left ventricular hypertrophy after an intermediate period of follow-up.

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{surgical}} results of trabeculectomy and Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation after a previous failed trabeculectomy. Methods: A retrospective comparative case series review {{was performed on}} 31 eye surgeries in 20 patients with primary congenital glaucoma who underwent trabeculectomy or Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation af-ter a previous failed trabeculectomy with mitomycin C. Results: The preoperative mean intraocular pressure was 25. 5 mmHg in the trabeculectomy group and 26. 9 mmHg in the Ahmed glaucoma <b>valve</b> implantation <b>group</b> (p = 0. 73). The 48 -month postoperative mean intra-ocular pressure was 19. 6 mmHg in the trabeculectomy group and 20. 2 mmHg in the Ahmed glaucoma <b>valve</b> implantation <b>group</b> (p = 0. 95). The 12 -month trabeculectomy success rate was 69 %, compared with 64 % for Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation, and the 48 -month success rates were 42 % and 36 % for trabeculectomy and valve implantation, respectively. The success rates following the entire follow-up period were not signifi-cantly different {{between the two groups}} (p> 0. 05 by log rank test). Postoperative complications occurred in 25 % of the trabeculectomy-operated eyes and 9 % of the Ahmed-implanted eyes (p = 0. 38). Conclusions: There {{was no significant difference in}} surgical outcome between the trabeculectomy and Ahmed glaucoma <b>valve</b> implantation <b>groups,</b> neither of which had favorable results.

40|$|ObjectivesAortic {{dilatation}} {{occurs in}} many patients with bicuspid aortic valves. We have added root replacement using the remodeling technique originally designed for tricuspid aortic valves to bicuspid aortic valve repair {{for treatment of}} the dilated root. We compared the results of remodeling in bicuspid aortic valves with those in tricuspid aortic valves. MethodsFrom October 1995 through January 2004, 60 patients underwent root remodeling for bicuspid aortic <b>valves</b> (<b>group</b> A), and 130 patients underwent root remodeling for tricuspid aortic <b>valves</b> (<b>group</b> B). Correction of cusp prolapse was more often performed in group A (group A, 50 / 60; group B, 47 / 130; P <. 0001). Transthoracic echocardiography was performed at 1 week, 6 and 12 months, and every year thereafter. Cumulative follow-up was 527 patient-years (mean, 2. 9 Â± 2 years). ResultsNo patient died in group A. Hospital mortality in group B was 5 % (5 / 100; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 6 %- 11. 3 %) after elective operations and 10 % (3 / 30; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 1 %- 26. 5 %) after emergency operations. Mean systolic gradients were identical at 1 year (group A, 4. 8 Â± 2. 1 mm Hg; group B, 4. 0 Â± 2 mm Hg) and 5 years (group A, 4. 5 Â± 2. 3 mm Hg; group B, 3. 9 Â± 2. 2 mm Hg). Freedom from aortic regurgitation of grade 2 or higher at 5 years was 96 % in group A and 83 % in group B (P =. 07), and freedom from reoperation at 5 years was 98 % in group A and 98 % in group B (P =. 73). ConclusionsValve-sparing aortic replacement with root remodeling {{can be applied to}} aortic dilatation and a regurgitant bicuspid aortic valve. Hemodynamic function and valve stability of a repaired bicuspid aortic valve are comparable with those seen in cases of tricuspid anatomy...|$|R
40|$|Background-: It is {{suggested}} that in young adults the Ross procedure results in better late patient survival compared with mechanical prosthesis implantation. We performed a propensity score-matched study that assessed late survival in young adult patients after a Ross procedure versus that after mechanical aortic valve replacement with optimal self-management anticoagulation therapy. Methods and results-: We selected 918 Ross patients and 406 mechanical valve patients 18 to 60 years of age without dissection, aneurysm, or mitral valve replacement who survived an elective procedure (1994 to 2008). With the use of propensity score matching, late survival was compared between the 2 groups. Two hundred fifty-three patients with a mechanical valve (mean follow-up, 6. 3 years) could be propensity matched to a Ross patient (mean follow-up, 5. 1 years). Mean age of the matched cohort was 47. 3 years in the Ross procedure group and 48. 0 years in the mechanical <b>valve</b> <b>group</b> (Pâ¤ 0. 17); the ratio of male to female patients was 3. 2 in the Ross procedure group and 2. 7 in the mechanical <b>valve</b> <b>group</b> (Pâ¤ 0. 46). Linearized all-cause mortality rate was 0. 53 % per patient-year in the Ross procedure group compared with 0. 30 % per patient-year in the mechanical <b>valve</b> <b>group</b> (matched hazard ratio, 1. 86; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 58 to 5. 91; Pâ¤ 0. 32). Late survival was {{comparable to that of}} the general German population. Conclusions-: In comparable patients, there is no late survival difference in the first postoperative decade between the Ross procedure and mechanical aortic valve implantation with optimal anticoagulation self-management. Survival in these selected young adult patients closely resembles that of the general population, possibly as a result of highly specialized anticoagulation self-management, better timing of surgery, and improved patient selection in recent years.

40|$|BackgroundâThis study {{evaluated}} {{the potential for}} an inspiratory impedance threshold valve (ITV) to improve 24 -hour survival and neurological function in a pig model of cardiac arrest. Methods and ResultsâUsing a randomized, prospective, and blinded design, we compared {{the effects of a}} sham versus active ITV on 24 -hour survival and neurological function. After 6 minutes of ventricular fibrillation (VF), followed by 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with either a sham or an active valve, anesthetized pigs received 3 sequential 200 -J shocks. If VF persisted, they received epinephrine (0. 045 mg/kg), 90 seconds of CPR, and 3 more 200 -J shocks. A total of 11 of 20 pigs (55 %) in the sham versus 17 of 20 (85 %) in the active <b>valve</b> <b>group</b> survived for 24 hours (P 0. 05). Neurological scores were significantly higher with the active valve; the cerebral performance score (1 normal, 5 brain death) was 2. 20. 2 with the sham ITV versus 1. 40. 2 with the active valve (P 0. 05). A total of 1 of 11 in the sham versus 12 of 17 in the active <b>valve</b> <b>group</b> had completely normal neurological function (P 0. 05). Peak end-tidal CO 2 (PETCO 2) values were significantly higher with the active valve (20. 41. 0) than the sham (16. 81. 5) (P 0. 05). PETCO 2 18 mm Hg correlated with increased survival (P 0. 05). ConclusionsâUse of a functional ITV during standard CPR significantly improved 24 -hour survival rates and neurological recovery. PETCO 2 and systolic blood pressure were also significantly higher in the active <b>valve</b> <b>group.</b> These data support further evaluation of ITV during standard CPR.

40|$|SummaryBackground and purposePrevious {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that cardiac rehabilitation (CR) improves exercise tolerance and muscle strength in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and in patients after cardiac surgery. However, the association between exercise tolerance and muscular strength following CR and the comparison of relationships among various disease categories has not been fully examined. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to assess the relationship between exercise tolerance and muscle strength following CR in patients after cardiac surgery and patients with MI. Methods and resultsOne hundred and four patients who participated in CR for 6 months were enrolled [post-cardiac valve surgery (VALVE), n= 28; post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), n= 42; post-acute MI, n= 34]. The exercise tolerance, thigh/calf circumferences, and muscle strength were measured before and after CR. At the baseline, the thigh circumference was significantly smaller in the <b>VALVE</b> <b>group</b> than in the MI group. There were significant positive correlations between peak VËâ¡O 2 and muscle torques of the lower muscles in all groups. After 6 months, peak VËâ¡O 2 and muscle torque were significantly increased in all groups (p< 0. 001). A positive significant correlation between percent increases in peak VËâ¡O 2 and muscular strength was observed in the <b>VALVE</b> <b>group</b> (r= 0. 51, p< 0. 01), but not in the other groups. In addition, the changes in peak VËâ¡O 2 and calf circumference after CR were significantly higher in the <b>VALVE</b> <b>group</b> than in the MI group. ConclusionsThese data suggest that exercise intolerance in patients after heart valve surgery may in part depend on decreased muscular strength. Further studies are needed to assess whether the strategy of increasing muscular strength of lower limb by programmed resistance training could be effective for improving exercise intolerance in patients after heart valve surgery and symptomatic patients with heart failure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{engineering}} buoyancy {{control scheme}} was proposed {{to compensate the}} change of residual buoyancy for low-speed under-actuated AUVs. The buoyancy control system {{is made up of}} buoyancy controller and two sets of buoyancy control devices include: water tank, sea water pump, <b>valve</b> <b>grouping,</b> pipeline etc. Buoyancy control devices were configured to both head and tail part of the AUV symmetrical to its buoyant center. Depth control algorithm and buoyancy control algorithm were proposed separately. In the process of voyage at a constant depth, the real time speed, pitch angle and depth error were detected to evaluate the residual buoyancy indirectly, and then the real time buoyancy control was executed by pumping the water into or out of the tanks. The buoyancy control scheme was applied to the type of low-speed under-actuated AUV and simulation and experiments results show that the buoyancy control approach and the control laws are feasible and effective...|$|R
