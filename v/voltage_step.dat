Promising results were achieved in the simulation of single quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons.

A general condition describing the conservation of charge in a non-linear capacitor that {{was used as the}} basis for the experiments is derived in the Appendix. It was shown that earlier criteria concerning equality of 'on' and 'off' charge in response to large steps are insufficient to exclude resistive models.

5000|$|A {{transmission}} line circuit which circumvented the above problem, producing an output pulse {{equal to the}} power supply voltage V, was invented in 1937 by British engineer Alan Blumlein and is widely used today in PFNs. [...] In the Blumlein generator (animation, right), the load is connected in series between two equal length {{transmission line}}s, which are charged by a DC power supply at one end (note that the righthand line is charged through the impedance of the load). [...] To trigger the pulse, a switch short-circuits {{the line at the}} power supply end, causing a negative <b>voltage</b> <b>step</b> to travel toward the load. Since the characteristic impedance Z0 of the line is made equal to half the load impedance RL, the <b>voltage</b> <b>step</b> is half reflected and half transmitted, resulting in two symmetrical opposite polarity voltage steps which propagate away from the load, creating between them a voltage drop of V/2 − (−V/2) = V across the load. The voltage steps reflect from the ends and return, ending the pulse. As in other charge line generators, the pulse duration is equal to 2D/c, where D is the length of the individual transmission lines. [...] A second advantage of the Blumlein geometry is that the switching device can be grounded, rather than located in the high voltage side of the transmission line as in the typical charged line, which complicates the triggering electronics.|$|E

5000|$|In practice, {{feedback}} amplifiers must {{be designed}} with phase margins substantially {{in excess of}} 0°, even though amplifiers with phase margins of, say, 1° are theoretically stable. The reason is that many practical factors can reduce the phase margin below the theoretical minimum. A prime example is when the amplifier's output is connected to a capacitive load. Therefore, operational amplifiers are usually compensated to achieve a minimum phase margin of 45° or so. This means that at the frequency at which the open and closed loop gains meet, the phase angle is &minus;135°. The calculation is: -135° - (-180°) = 45°. [...] See Warwickor Stoutfor {{a detailed analysis of}} the techniques and results of compensation to ensure adequate phase margins. See also the article [...] "Pole splitting". Often amplifiers are designed to achieve a typical phase margin of 60 degrees. If the typical phase margin is around 60 degrees then the minimum phase margin will typically be greater than 45 degrees. A phase margin of 60 degrees is also a magic number because it allows for the fastest settling time when attempting to follow a <b>voltage</b> <b>step</b> input (a Butterworth design). An amplifier with lower phase margin will ring for longer and an amplifier with more phase margin will take a longer time to rise to the voltage step's final level.|$|E

Bath application of 293 B blocked IKs, elicited by 4 -s depolarizing voltage pulses from a holding potential of − 50 mV, under conditions in which the L-type Ca 2 + current (ICa,L) and IKr were inhibited; the effect was concentration-dependent with an IC 50 of 5. 3 μM, when evaluated by the decrease in the amplitude of IKs tail current following 4 -s depolarizing <b>voltage</b> <b>steps</b> to + 50 mV. The 293 B block of IKs progressed with time during depolarizing <b>voltage</b> <b>steps</b> with a more rapid block at higher concentrations. The block of IKs by 293 B was fully reversed {{within a few minutes}} after washing off the drug, even when a maximal effect (a nearly full block) was achieved at high drug concentration (50 μM). Bath application of 293 B at 50 μM greatly and reversibly reduced the amplitude of IKs which is maximally stimulated by β-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline (1 μM), while the degree of 293 B block of the isoprenaline-stimulated IKs was slightly but significantly smaller than that of non-stimulated IKs (94. 0 ± 0. 98 % block, n= 6 vs 99. 4 ± 0. 45 % block, n= 6; P< 0. 01). We conclude that, in guinea-pig SA node cells (i) 293 B is a potent and fully reversible blocker of IKs in control and during β-adrenergic stimulation and (ii) block with 293 B occurs in a time-dependent manner during depolarizing <b>voltage</b> <b>steps...</b>|$|R
