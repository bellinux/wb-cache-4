5000|$|Hydraulic {{pumps are}} used in {{hydraulic}} drive systems and can be hydrostatic or hydrodynamic.A hydraulic pump is a mechanical source of power that converts mechanical power into hydraulic energy (hydrostatic energy i.e. flow, pressure). It generates flow with enough power to overcome pressure induced by the load at the pump outlet. When a hydraulic pump operates, it creates a vacuum at the pump inlet, which forces liquid from the reservoir into the inlet line to the pump and by mechanical action delivers this liquid to the pump outlet and forces it into the hydraulic system.Hydrostatic pumps are positive displacement pumps while hydrodynamic pumps can be fixed displacement pumps, in which the displacement (flow through the pump per rotation of the pump) cannot be adjusted, or <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps,</b> which have a more complicated construction that allows the displacement to be adjusted. Although, hydrodynamic pumps are more frequent in day-to-day life. Hydrostatics pump which are of various types works {{on the principle of}} Pascal's law.

40|$|The {{majority}} of hydraulic systems are controlled using a metering valve {{or the use}} of <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> Metering valve control is compact and has a high control bandwidth, but it is energy inefficient due to throttling losses. <b>Variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> are far more efficient as the pump only produces the required flow, but comes with the cost of additional bulk, sluggish response, and added cost. In a previous paper [1], a hydromechanical analog of an electronic switch-mode power supply was proposed to create the functional equivalent of a variable displacement pump. This approach combines a fixed displacement pump with a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) on/off valve, a check valve, and an accumulator. The effective pump displacement can be varied by adjusting the PWM duty ratio. Since on/off valves exhibit low loss when fully open or fully closed, the proposed system is potentially more energy efficient than metering valve control, while achieving this efficiency without many of the shortcomings of traditional <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> The system also allows for a host of programmable features that can be implemented via control of the PWM duty ratio. This paper presents initial experimental validation of the concept as well as an investigation of the system efficiency. The experimental apparatus was built using available off-the-shelf components and uses a linear proportional spindle valve as the PWM valve. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach can achieve variable control function more efficiently than a valve controlled system, and that by increasing the PWM frequency and adding closed-loop control can decrease syste...|$|E

Hydraulic pump-controlled servo systems have high energy-efficiency.

40|$|Abstract — Positive {{displacement}} pumps {{are used in}} auto-motive transmissions to provide pressurized fluid to various hydraulic components in the transmission and also lubricate the mechanical components. The output flow of these pumps increases with speed, almost linearly, but the flow requirements often saturate at higher speeds resulting in the excess flow draining back to the sump. This represents a parasitic loss in the transmission leading to a loss in fuel economy. To overcome this issue, <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> {{have been used in}} the transmission, where the output flow is reduced by controlling the displacement of the pump. The use of these pumps in automatic transmissions, has resulted in better fuel economy as compared to some types of fixed {{displacement pumps}}. However, the literature does not fully explore the benefits of <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> to a specific type of transmission namely, dual-clutch transmission, that has different pressure & flow requirements than an epicyclic gear-train. This paper presents an analysis on the effect of pump selection on fuel economy in a five speed dual clutch transmission of a commercial vehicle. Models of the engine, transmission & vehicle are developed along with the models of two different types of pumps: a fixed displacement gerotor pump and a variable displacement vane pump. The models are then parameterized using experimental data and the fuel economy of the vehicle is simulated on a standard driving cycle. The results suggest that the fuel economy benefit obtained by the use of the variable displacement pump in dual clutch transmissions is comparable to that of automatic transmissions. I...|$|E

40|$|This project {{developed}} the inlet metering system. An inlet metering system represents a new option in hydraulic pump design. Traditional pressure controlled hydraulic pumps rely on either swashplate displacement (for <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps)</b> or bleed off valves (for fixed displacement pumps). <b>Variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> require mechanically complex parts which are expensive to machine {{and prone to}} break down. Bleed off valves represent a significant loss in system efficiency. In contrast, the inlet metering system is able {{to make use of}} a fixed displacement pump (which is relatively inexpensive and mechanically robust) and a two-way spool valve. This dissertation goes through the process of designing the valve and pump dimensions, presents a theoretical dynamic analysis, studies the control law associated with this pump, and examines the energy requirements associated with inlet metering system operation. A prototype of the design was constructed and experimental data was used to validate the efficiency analysis. The major finding associated with this work was that the inlet metering system can be designed to display a first order pressure response. This means that when the inlet metering system is operated, the actual pressure in the system will never exceed the desired pressure. In contrast, traditional hydraulic systems will display up to 60 % pressure overshoot, meaning the systems must be designed to handle pressures significantly greater than operating pressures. Additionally {{it was found that the}} inlet metering system is more efficient than using a bleed off valve, but less efficient than using a variable displacement pump...|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} {{precisely}} controlling {{the position of}} a hydraulic actuator using an on/off valve is developed. Since valves exhibit little power loss when they are fully open or fully closed, the proposed system is more efficient than throttling valve control and can achieve flow variation without the expense or bulk of a <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump.</b> Mating a pulse-width-modulated (PWMed) on/off valve with a fixed <b>displacement</b> <b>pump</b> and a smoothing accumulator creates a software enabled <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pump.</b> A drawback of using digital valve control for hydraulic systems is that the relatively low speed of the currently available switching valves results in a significant ripple in the pressure and flow rate. We propose a solution to this problem by using a throttling valve to shield the actuator from the ripple in the output. This creates an effective load sensing system with the throttling valve used only to provide a small known pressure drop between the supply and the load. This approach is significantly more efficient than the conventional technique of using throttling to vary the full flow. This paper presents an averaged model of the system and a nonlinear controller to achieve position control of an actuator. ...|$|R

One of the energy-efficient alternatives to today 2 ̆ 7 s valve-controlled hydraulic systems is displacement controlled (DC) actuation, in which hydraulic cylinders and motors are controlled directly by <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps.</b> ^ The primary contribution of this thesis is a novel method for optimizing the operation of mobile machines with multiple DC actuators. The proposed power management method improves fuel economy by adjusting the operating points of the hydraulic pumps and diesel engine. The instantaneous rate of fuel consumption is minimized based on operator commands and detailed maps of pump and engine efficiency, including hydraulic energy recovery. Tradeoffs between dynamic response and steady-state efficiency are also considered. In order to facilitate real-time operation, the multi-actuator optimization problem is reduced to a one-dimensional minimization problem without compromising the solution. ^ In support of the new power management method, nonlinear models are derived for <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>pumps</b> and DC linear and rotary actuators. A sliding mode control law is proposed for robustly controlling pump displacement in spite of uncertain control pressure and swash plate moment.
