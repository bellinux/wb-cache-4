The ICCA also acknowledges a cause of action for breach of [...] "fair and honorable dealings." [...] This is compensable with money damages for breach of fiduciary duty. This fiduciary duty gives rise for a claim of unconscionable compensation even when the transfer remains <b>valid.</b> <b>Liability</b> under the fiduciary duty is sometimes the same whether the breach occurred before or after the ratification of the Constitution. However, other cases have held that the duty did not arise until 1790. This duty also gives rise to recovery for negligence, such as [...] "surveying errors". In no case would the ICCA compensate a tribe for harm by state governments.|$|E

40|$|The FY 2000 Flying Hour Program (FHP) {{comprised}} $ 3. 2 {{billion of}} the Operations and Maintenance, Navy (OandM, N) appropriation, nearly half of which was allocated to the Commander Naval Air Forces Pacific (CNAP) for flight operations and aircraft maintenance. Insufficient funding has {{made it impossible to}} execute the FHP to the Navy Primary Mission Readiness standard of 83 percent. This thesis analyzed CNAP FHP cash management for fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000, including techniques used by managers to execute the under-funded FHP. It concluded that CNAP managers use risk contingent cash management strategies and techniques to fund requirements while carefully avoiding Anti-deficiency Act violations. These techniques include delaying required aviation repairs to future years, reducing at home squadron flying hours and using Unfilled Customer Orders. Navy budgeting does not recognize <b>valid</b> <b>liabilities</b> for some FHP related programs. The FHP is treated as discretionary and used annually as a source to pay these recurring liabilities, causing CNAP to be reactive in cash deficit control, always in need of fiscal rescue. CNAP transaction costs are increased by constant management of funding shortfalls. The risk of failing to meet fleet readiness requirements has grown as a consequence...|$|R
5000|$|Federal Rule 403 allows {{relevant}} evidence to be excluded [...] "if its probative value is substantially {{outweighed by the}} danger of unfair prejudice", if it leads to confusion of the issues, if it is misleading {{or if it is}} a waste of time. California Evidence Code section 352 also allows for exclusion to avoid [...] "substantial danger of undue prejudice." [...] For example, evidence that the victim of a car accident was apparently a [...] "liar, cheater, womanizer, and a man of low morals" [...] was unduly prejudicial and irrelevant to whether he had a <b>valid</b> product <b>liability</b> claim against the manufacturer of the tires on his van (which had rolled over resulting in severe brain damage).|$|R

5000|$|In law, liable means [...] "responsible or {{answerable}} in law; legally obligated." [...] Legal liability concerns both {{civil law}} and criminal law and can arise from various areas of law, such as contracts, torts, taxes, or fines given by government agencies. The claimant {{is the one}} who seeks to establish, or prove, liability. Claimants can prove liability through a myriad of different theories, known as theories of liability. Which theories of liability are available in a given case depends on nature of the law in question. For example, in case involving a contractual dispute, one available theory of liability is breach of contract; or in the tort context, negligence, negligence per se, respondeat superior, vicarious liability, strict liability, or intentional conduct are all <b>valid</b> theories of <b>liability.</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} a {{bank guarantee}} as an institute {{derived from a}} surety contract. By issuing a bank guarantee the bank commits to the creditor that it will fulfill <b>valid</b> and due <b>liabilities</b> of a debtor, {{in the event of}} default by the debtor. This collateral demonstrates significant advantages as compared to other personal assets, particularly with regards to a higher level of protection to creditors in contractual relations. Due to the aforementioned benefit the institute has been increasingly applied in legal dealings, both in our and other legal systems. In the paper, I will point out normative solutions in terms of regulation of a bank guarantee as a specific legal activity {{in which there is no}} accessoriness, which is not the case with security. This research particularly focuses on the comparative legal analysis of this collateral...|$|R

That the plaintiff's {{exclusive}} remedy {{was against}} the initial carrier, the Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern Railroad Company, under the Carmack amendment of 20 of the Hepburn bill Stat. at L. 593, chap. 3591, Comp. Stat. 1913, 8592. '2d. That, under the stipulation {{in the bill of}} lading providing for the filing of claims for loss or damage, the action was barred.' The first contention is met by repeated decisions of this court. The connecting carrier is not relieved from liability by the Carmack amendment, but the bill of lading required to be issued by the initial carrier upon U.S. 190, 195 an interstate shipment governs the entire transportation, and thus fixes the obligations of all participating carriers {{to the extent that the}} terms of the bill of lading are applicable and <b>valid.</b> 'The <b>liability</b> of any carrier in the route over which the articles were routed, for loss or damage, is that imposed by the act as measured by the original contract of shipment, so far as it is valid under the act.'
