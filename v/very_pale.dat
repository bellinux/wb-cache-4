5|$|C. c. capellanus (P.L. Sclater, 1877) {{is known}} as the Mesopotamian crow or Iraqi pied crow. This {{distinctive}} form occurs in Iraq and southwestern Iran. It has <b>very</b> <b>pale</b> grey plumage which looks almost white from a distance. It is possibly distinct enough to be considered a separate species.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be employed}} {{in the field to}} aid in the identification of S.pungens. With an application of a drop of KOH, the flesh will turn vinaceous (the color of red wine), the tubes red, the cap cuticle black, and the stipe cuticle pale vinaceous. With ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), the flesh becomes <b>very</b> <b>pale</b> vinaceous, and the tubes turn bright red. Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) turns the flesh gray, the tubes dark gray to black, and the stipe cuticle light gray.|$|E
5000|$|Gills: [...] and <b>very</b> numerous, <b>pale</b> cream brown to {{yellowish}} tan.|$|R

60|$|He was <b>very</b> quiet, <b>pale</b> to the lips. A strange, hunted {{expression}} {{had crept}} into his eyes.|$|R
5|$|A yellowish-brown pigment is {{diffused}} {{through the}} cytosol of the hyphae and is much deeper in color {{just below the}} cuticle of the cap. In very young fruit bodies, stems and caps are <b>very</b> <b>pale</b> buff, but soon {{the color of the}} cap deepens and becomes cinnamon. The intensity of the color appears to be dependent on light, for when fruit bodies are grown in diffuse light (temperature and humidity being constant) they are a uniform pale buff color, but in bright light they are cinnamon or tan.|$|E
5|$|Larger ships {{often had}} false bows and sterns painted in a {{different}} shade {{from the rest of}} the hull to create the impression of the ship being at greater range from the observer. German decks were a very dark gray. Smaller ships operating in the North Sea or Baltic Sea were painted white or a <b>very</b> <b>pale</b> gray to blend in with daytime mist and nighttime phosphorescent organisms. As in the First World War, the Germans again employed disguised commerce raiders, Hilfskreuzer such as Atlantis, Thor and Kormoran. These ships were able to modify their appearance to throw off the searching Allied cruisers.|$|E
5|$|The base {{color of}} the living animal is <b>very</b> <b>pale</b> subtranslucent yellow. The mantle, kidney, and {{hepatopancreas}} are visible through the shell but are often slightly obscured by {{the thickness of the}} shell. The dorsal surface of the mantle is pale yellow, tinted with olive, often marked with black streaks and blotches. Over the hepatopancreas is a golden yellow tessellation that is marked with gray or black spots and streaks. A dark marking on the posterior surface of the foot is distinctive. However, the mark is not present on the hatchlings, making them impossible to identify in the field. The mark becomes obvious once the snail reaches approximately 6 to 9mm in length.|$|E
50|$|The underside's ground colour is similar, suffused on the {{anterior}} {{half of the}} forewing and over the whole surface of the hindwing with a greenish tint that varies to an ochraceous yellow, and, except in the <b>very</b> <b>palest</b> specimens, is evenly irrorated (sprinkled) over the greenish or ochraceous-tinted areas with transverse, short, reddish-brown strigae; both forewings and hindwings with generally an obscure discocellular reddish-brown spot or indication thereof.|$|R
5000|$|Larva is a <b>very</b> slender <b>pale</b> bluish grey semi-looper. Fine darker {{longitudinal}} lines present. The larvae feed on Phyllanthus species.|$|R
50|$|Augustine Henry. This {{is a tall}} growing variety, with <b>very</b> large, <b>pale</b> green leaves. It {{produces}} a strong leader and a cylindrical trunk.|$|R
5|$|The halogens darken in colour as {{the group}} is descended: {{fluorine}} is a <b>very</b> <b>pale</b> yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid. Iodine conforms to the prevailing trend, being a shiny black crystalline solid that melts at 114°C and boils at 183°C to form a violet gas. This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group (though astatine may not conform to it, depending on how metallic {{it turns out to}} be). Specifically, the violet colour of iodine gas results from the electron transition between the highest occupied antibonding πg molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding σu molecular orbital.|$|E
5|$|All four stable halogens {{experience}} intermolecular van der Waals {{forces of}} attraction, and their strength increases together with number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic halogen molecules. Thus, the melting and boiling points of bromine are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. As {{a result of}} the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group, the density and heats of fusion and vaporisation of bromine are again intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine, although all their heats of vaporisation are fairly low (leading to high volatility) thanks to their diatomic molecular structure. The halogens darken in colour as the group is descended: fluorine is a <b>very</b> <b>pale</b> yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid that melts at −7.2°C and boils at 58.8°C. (Iodine is a shiny black solid.) This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group. Specifically, the colour of a halogen, such as bromine, results from the electron transition between the highest occupied antibonding πg molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding σu molecular orbital. The colour fades at low temperatures, so that solid bromine at −195°C is pale yellow.|$|E
5|$|The {{majuscule}} letters have elegant shape, but {{a little}} less simple {{than those in the}} Sinaiticus and Vaticanus codices. These letters, {{at the end of a}} line, are often very small, and much of the writing is <b>very</b> <b>pale</b> and faint. Punctuation is more frequent, usually on a level with the top of the preceding letter, while a vacant space, proportionate to the break in the sense, follows the end of a paragraph. At the end of each book the colophon is ornamented by pretty volutes from prima manu. There are found the Ammonian Sections with references to the Eusebian Canons stand in the margin of the text of the Gospels. It contains divisions into larger sections – κεφάλαια, the headings of these sections (τίτλοι) stand at the top of the pages. The places at which those sections commence are indicated throughout the Gospels, and in Luke and John their numbers are placed in the margin of each column. To all the Gospels (except Matthew, because of lacunae) is prefixed by a table of κεφάλαια (table of contents).|$|E
50|$|Head and thorax {{black with}} two {{brownish}} tufts on collar. Abdomen black with <b>very</b> minute <b>pale</b> lateral spots and segmental lines. Claws unequal.|$|R
50|$|The {{forewings}} & hindwings of {{this species}} are <b>very</b> transparent, <b>pale</b> yellow-green, rippled with white; costa finely ochreus; the fringe is pale green, cell spot black.|$|R
50|$|The uniform {{changed from}} a <b>very</b> {{traditional}} <b>pale</b> blue and white striped shirt and pleated navy skirt, to the current uniform in 2002, with a mixed response from pupils.|$|R
25|$|The ground colour of Siberian tigers' pelage {{is often}} <b>very</b> <b>pale,</b> {{especially}} in winter coat. However, variations within populations may be considerable. Individual variation {{is also found}} in form, length, and partly in colour, of the dark stripes, which have been described as being dark brown rather than black.|$|E
25|$|In the Jura wine region, the Arbois AOC makes <b>very</b> <b>pale,</b> pink red wines {{that are}} often mistaken for rosés from Pinot noir and the local Poulsard and Trousseau {{varieties}}. But the region also makes even paler actual rosés from the same grape varieties that are pressed {{after only a few}} hours of skin contact.|$|E
25|$|In the Valle d'Aosta DOC, locals {{refer to}} the {{indigenous}} grape Premetta as a rosato naturale due to the extremely thin and lightly pigmented skins of the variety that even with extended maceration can only produce a <b>very</b> <b>pale</b> rosé wine. According to wine experts Joe Bastianich and David Lynch, Valle d'Aosta Premetta rosés are very fruity with strawberry aromas and spicy cinnamon notes.|$|E
50|$|This is a large, <b>very</b> agile, <b>pale</b> brown slug, with {{a length}} of 12 cm. It has a small ear-shaped, {{external}} shell, less than 1 cm long, {{at the tail end}} of the mantle.|$|R
60|$|Zenobia {{had turned}} aside. But I caught the {{reflection}} of {{her face in the}} mirror, {{and saw that it was}} <b>very</b> pale,--as <b>pale,</b> in her rich attire, as if a shroud were round her.|$|R
50|$|Median band narrower, straighter and bluer than {{in other}} East African races (of Papilio bromius). Submarginal spots below <b>very</b> large, <b>paler</b> {{mottling}} absent. <b>Very</b> similar to Papilio brontes and can only be determined with certainty by dissection.|$|R
25|$|Rubies are {{corundum}} {{which contain}} chromium impurities that absorb yellow-green light {{and result in}} deeper ruby red color with increasing content. Purple sapphires contain trace amounts of vanadium and {{come in a variety}} of shades. Corundum that contains ~0.01% of titanium is colorless. If trace amounts of iron are present, a <b>very</b> <b>pale</b> yellow to green color may be seen. However, if both titanium and iron impurities are present together, and in the correct valence states, the result is a deep-blue color.|$|E
25|$|The grove snail, Cepaea nemoralis, {{is famous}} for the rich {{polymorphism}} of its shell. The system is controlled {{by a series of}} multiple alleles. The shell colour series is brown (genetically the top dominant trait), dark pink, light pink, <b>very</b> <b>pale</b> pink, dark yellow and light yellow (the bottom or universal recessive trait). Bands may be present or absent; and if present from one to five in number. Unbanded is the top dominant trait, and the forms of banding are controlled by modifier genes (see epistasis).|$|E
25|$|Underside ochraceous light brown, shaded with orange-yellow on apex of forewing {{and on the}} {{anterior}} portion of the postdiscal band on the hindwing; the markings similar on the upperside but somewhat diffuse, the discoidal streak and posterior half of inner sub-terminal band on forewing and the postdiscal band posteriorly on the hindwing suffused with <b>very</b> <b>pale</b> bluish pink; the interspaces of the ground colour smallish darker brown blotches, forming on the hindwing a conspicuous discal transverse series of spots in the interspaces; the dorsal margin of the hindwing broadly bluish white.|$|E
25|$|Larva. Cylindrical; {{head and}} anal segment with short simple spines; {{segments}} three to 12 with longer branched spines, reddish brown, those on {{three and four}} comparatively <b>very</b> long. <b>Pale</b> green, with yellowish-white lateral stripes one on each side.|$|R
50|$|This {{species has}} a {{wingspan}} of 38-46 mm. The forewings are dark brown, often variegated with paler and reddish patches and usually with prominent whitish postterminal fascia. The hindwings are <b>very</b> distinctive, <b>pale</b> straw-coloured {{with a broad}} blackish band at the margin.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 28-38 mm. The forewings {{are deep}} ferruginous-brown. The stigmata are obscure, cloudy and darker, the plical rather beyond the first discal. There is a <b>very</b> faint <b>paler</b> strongly curved subterminal line. The hindwings range from pale to rather dark reddish-fuscous.|$|R
25|$|During this period, the colours of {{the flag}} were <b>very</b> <b>pale,</b> with the red {{appearing}} closer to pink in practice. There were three variants {{of the flag}} in use. The state flag was a tricolour with the lion and sun emblem in the centre. The national flag and civil ensign was a plain tricolour with no emblem. The naval ensign and war flag {{was similar to the}} state flag, but the emblem was surrounded by a wreath and surmounted by a crown. All three flags had a 1:3 ratio.|$|E
25|$|Inside {{there is}} an arch-braced hammerbeam roof. This is seen to full effect because of the {{contrasting}} dark-stained wood against <b>very</b> <b>pale</b> ceiling paint, and {{the large amount of}} light from clear-glazed windows. Until at least 1984 there was an 1870 carved, square, marble font standing on four marble colonnettes, designed by Mallinson and Barber and funded by Mrs Bensted, wife of the vicar of Lockwood. The font was replaced in the 1980s, when the church room was installed inside the back of the nave, and the whereabouts of the original is unknown. Because an artisan painter is credited, there may originally have been wall paintings.|$|E
25|$|His first {{impression}} {{was that it}} was the remains of an animal, very mutilated, and in an advanced state of decomposition. The carcass was <b>very</b> <b>pale</b> pink, almost white, in colour, with a silver reflection in the sunlight. It was composed of a rubbery substance of a very hard consistency, such that it could only be cut with great difficulty. The part of the carcass that was visible measured 18 feet (approx. 6 meters) in length and 7 feet (approx. 2½ meters) in width. Webb estimated its weight at nearly 5 tons, if not more. He believed it was the remains of a giant octopus, as it appeared to have the stumps of four arms, with another arm buried nearby.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 14-16 mm. The forewings {{are light}} fuscous and the hindwings are light fuscous, somewhat lighter towards base. Males {{have a large}} expansible tuft of <b>very</b> long <b>pale</b> ochreous-yellowish hairs {{from the base of}} the dorsum on the underside of the hindwings.|$|R
60|$|I {{immediately}} {{ran to the}} overhanging ledge of rock, {{from which}} he was looking down into the sea, and bent over it. There I saw a <b>very</b> faint, <b>pale</b> object of a greenish colour, which seemed to move slightly while I looked at it.|$|R
50|$|Adults are ash grey, microscopically {{dusted with}} brown. There is a crescentic, <b>very</b> indistinct <b>pale</b> fascia at the {{beginning}} of the ciliae, very concave towards the base of the wing. There are also one or two minute dark spots on the disc, and one at its apex.|$|R
