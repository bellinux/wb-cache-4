5|$|ILM created 527 {{shots for}} the film, using {{programs}} such as Maya. Perception worked on over 125 shots for the film. They crafted gadgets, such as Tony Stark's transparent LG smartphone, and created the backdrops for the Stark Expo {{as well as the}} computer screen interfaces on the touch-screen coffee table and the holographic lab environment. In total, 11 <b>visual</b> <b>effect</b> studios worked on the film.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{the film}} began in January 2006. Several <b>visual</b> <b>effect</b> {{companies}} were used to provide CGI for the numerous animals and the climactic flood scene. The main plot is a modern-day retelling of Noah's Ark. By the time the film had completed production, it had become the most expensive comedy film ever at the time; it was later overtaken by Men in Black 3. In October 2007, the film was released on DVD and HD DVD.|$|E
5|$|The game {{uses the}} <b>visual</b> <b>effect</b> of {{applying}} pre-rendered video footage to a polygon, specifically the game's pre-recorded {{shows on the}} television. IGN writer Anoop Gantayat praised this effect's implementation, although he did note some minor graphical issues visible in the transition from distanced to full-screen viewing. Also unusual for the Pokémon video game series, the Pokémon's voices are borrowed from the anime and sound like their names.|$|E

5|$|The low-lying damp ground {{can produce}} a <b>visual</b> <b>effect</b> known as a Fata Morgana when the Tor appears to rise out of the mist.

5|$|There is no {{encryption}} algorithm {{present in the}} Agrippa binary; consequently, the visual encryption effect that displays when the poem has finished is a ruse. The <b>visual</b> <b>effect</b> {{is the result of}} running the decrypted ciphertext (in memory) through the re-purposed bit-scrambling decryption algorithm, and then abandoning the text in memory. Only the fake genetic code is written back to disk.|$|E
5|$|The album's cover was, like {{several other}} Pink Floyd albums, {{designed}} by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. It {{consists of a}} photograph of a man sitting in a tree which has been taken out of focus to the point of complete distortion. Hipgnosis viewed a number of stills from the film on a 35mm projector, and liked the <b>visual</b> <b>effect</b> when the slide jammed. Schroeder later said the band did not want to make the cover particularly good as The Dark Side of the Moon would have to compete with it, but Thorgerson insisted it was given proper consideration like any other Floyd album.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{nominated}} for Best Action Movie at the 2009 Critics' Choice Awards. The Visual Effects Society nominated it for Best Single <b>Visual</b> <b>Effect</b> of the Year (the valley destruction), Best Outstanding Matte Paintings, Best Models and Miniatures, and Best Created Environment in a Feature Motion Picture (the inside of the temple). The film ranks 453rd on Empires 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time. It was nominated at the Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Costumes and Best Special Effects. It won Best Costumes. At the 51st Grammy Awards, John Williams won an award for the Mutt Williams theme.|$|E
5|$|The {{first film}} has around 540 effect shots, the second 799, {{and the third}} 1,488 (2,730 in total). The total {{increases}} to 3,420 with the extended editions. 260 <b>visual</b> <b>effect</b> artists began work on the series, and the number doubled by The Two Towers. The crew, led by Jim Rygiel and Randy Cook, worked long hours, often overnight, to produce special effects within a short space of time. Jackson's active imagination was a driving force. For example, several major shots of Helm's Deep were produced within {{the last six weeks}} of post-production of The Two Towers, and the same happened again within the last six weeks on The Return of the King.|$|E

5|$|A {{visually}} striking {{effect is}} seen every March and September as an unusual shadow occurs around the equinoxes. A shadow appears to descend the west balustrade {{of the northern}} stairway. The <b>visual</b> <b>effect</b> is of a serpent descending the stairway, with its head at the base in light. Additionally the western face points to sunset around 25 May, traditionally the date of transition from the dry to the rainy season. The intended alignment was, however, likely incorporated in the northern (main) facade of the temple, as it corresponds to sunsets on May 20 and July 24, recorded also by the central axis of Castillo at Tulum.. The two dates are separated by 65 and 300 days, {{and it has been}} shown that the solar orientations in Mesoamerica regularly correspond to dates separated by calendrically significant intervals (multiples of 13 and 20 days).|$|E
5|$|Above {{the third}} setback, {{consisting}} of the 24th through 27th floors, the facade contains horizontal bands and zigzagged gray-and-black brick motifs. Above the fourth setback, between the 27th and 31st floors, the shaft starts to appear. At each corner of the 31st floor, large car-hood ornaments made of Nirosta steel serve as visually striking objects that make the base look larger. These corner extensions alleviate a common optical illusion seen in tall buildings with horizontal bands, whose taller floors would normally look larger. The 31st floor also contains a gray and white frieze of hubcaps and fenders, which both symbolizes the Chrysler Corporation {{and serves as a}} <b>visual</b> <b>effect</b> for the building's Art Deco design. The bonnet embellishments take the shape of Mercury's winged helmet, which was modeled after the hood ornament installed on Chrysler vehicles at the time.|$|E
5|$|Skilful use of {{headwind}} {{and thermal}} updrafts along various {{sections of the}} hill is used to generate additional lift, creating pressure under the oversized skis and enabling athletes to effectively ride on a 'cushion of air'. A reasonable amount of headwind is favourable to a long jump as it {{has the effect of}} keeping the athlete aloft and delaying their descent back onto the hill, whereas a tailwind or no wind at all is highly unfavourable and tends to shorten a jump by pushing the athlete downwards towards the hill too early. In particular, the presence of a tailwind forms one of the most challenging aspects of clearing the knoll and achieving a competitive distance. A crosswind is just as challenging, as it can create dangerous instability in the air. Conversely, in ideal headwind conditions, an athlete can 'catch' an updraft along various points of the hill – which always involves some degree of luck – and use it to glide even further, making for an impressive <b>visual</b> <b>effect</b> for audiences.|$|E

5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic <b>visual</b> <b>effect,</b> with indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow fairings, and sandwich steel body panels.|$|E
5|$|As the {{gameplay}} {{designs were}} being implemented, Brown switched {{focus to the}} game's aesthetics. Scenes from the game were sketched on storyboards to aid development. Cauldron IIs game world, the witch's castle, was designed to resemble Palace Software's logo as an advertising tactic. Brown photographed separate screens {{of the game and}} assembled them into a complete map, showing the shape of his company's logo, for video game magazines. Enemy designs were similar to those in the previous game, based on the Halloween holiday. Brown envisioned a graphical effect for the game's narration, showing a book whose pages turned as the story is read. However, technical limitations at the time prohibited the implementation of such a <b>visual</b> <b>effect.</b> Brown also wanted the game's visuals to scroll seamlessly as the character moved through the game world, but flick-screening (showing one section of the world at a time) was more feasible. As with the previous game, Brown created a Plasticine model of the witch character as a reference for a painting that was used for the game's box art. The group tested the game prior to release and deemed it too challenging. They reduced the difficulty level so that more players could complete the game.|$|E
5|$|Gatiss {{originally}} resisted having Dickens {{star in the}} episode, as {{traditionally the}} Doctor only mentioned meeting historical figures, but he eventually warmed to the idea. As A Christmas Carol fan, Gatiss wanted to set the episode at Christmas. He later realised that Dickens' journey in the episode mirrored that of Ebenezer Scrooge. In one scene, Gatiss wanted the knocker on a door behind Dickens to briefly show the Gelth's face in reference to A Christmas Carol, but this <b>visual</b> <b>effect</b> was not done. The episode originally began in the TARDIS, as Gatiss wanted the first glimpse of 1860 to be through Rose's eyes. While this changed, Gatiss still wanted to show how great travelling in time is. It was scripted that snow would blow into the TARDIS when the doors opened, but this was cut because of budget reasons. Davies requested {{a scene in which}} the Doctor takes Rose to the future to see a world filled with walking corpses— the result if they had left before defeating the Gelth— but this was too expensive to film. During the scene in which the Doctor and Dickens are talking in the coach, the driver was supposed to shout down to them (referencing a Dickens work) and the coach was to crash, but this was also too expensive.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} May 16, 1988, in the Tabernas Desert in Spain's Almería province. Spielberg originally had planned the chase to {{be a short}} sequence shot over two days, but he drew up storyboards to make the scene an action-packed centerpiece. Thinking he would not surpass the truck chase from Raiders of the Lost Ark (because the truck was much faster than the tank), he felt this sequence should be more story-based and needed to show Indiana and Henry helping each other. He later said he had more fun storyboarding the sequence than filming it. The second unit had begun filming two weeks before. After approximately ten days, the production moved to Bellas Artes to film the scenes set in the Sultan of Hatay's palace. Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park {{was used for the}} road, tunnel and beach sequence in which birds strike the plane. The Spanish portion of location filming finished on June 2, 1988, in Guadix, Granada, with filming of Brody's capture at İskenderun train station. The filmmakers built a mosque near the station for atmosphere, rather than adding it as a <b>visual</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
5|$|Throughout his scenes, Rupert Graves was tanned {{because before}} filming the episode, the actor was in Guadeloupe, an island on the Caribbean, {{appearing}} in Death in Paradise. As a result, Gatiss added mention that Lestrade went on holiday in the script. In the original episode, John was to hallucinate the hound at a meat storage locker. However, after visiting such a locker in Bristol, the producers came to realise {{that it would}} be too expensive, and cold for Freeman, forcing them to change the setting to the Baskerville labs. In one scene, Sherlock is driving a Land Rover with John as a passenger after their arrival at Dartmoor; John was originally {{going to be the one}} driving the car, however Freeman cannot drive. In the client scenes, Tovey had to smoke a herbal cigarette as it was illegal to smoke real cigarettes on set. Throughout the episode, the production crew used split dioptres in certain scenes, a camera technique where two separate camera angles are at the same focus on screen. The episode also includes shots of the hound, which was produced by visual effects. Although the series used computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the past, it was the first time a <b>visual</b> <b>effect</b> was made on a large scale. However, there was no guide for the cast to interact with.|$|E
