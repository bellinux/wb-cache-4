Further progress requires the dexterous application of computational techniques to catalogue (classify and count) the permutations into equivalence classes.|$|E

5|$|Natural thorium {{is usually}} almost pure 232Th, {{which is the}} longest-lived and most stable isotope of thorium, having a {{half-life}} comparable {{to the age of}} the universe. Its radioactive decay is the largest single contributor to the Earth's internal heat; the other major contributors are the shorter-lived primordial radionuclides, which are 238U, 40K, and 235U in descending order of their contribution. (At the time of the Earth's formation, 40K and 235U contributed much more by <b>virtue</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> short half-lives, but they have decayed more quickly, leaving the contribution from 232Th and 238U predominant.)

5|$|Settlement on the Mendip Hills {{appears to}} fall into two types.

The second was represented in the Iron Age Britain and Roman periods by large sites with specialist functions, existing by <b>virtue</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> ability to exert power over lowland producers. From the Iron Age onward the ownership of land took on increasing importance, with large landholdings based on the mines or on stock grazing, denying settlers access to the plateau or forcing them off the hills.|$|E

5|$|The Kannada {{poets and}} {{scholars}} {{of the empire}} produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called Devaranama (lyrical poems) in the native meters of Sangatya (quatrain), Suladi (beat based), Ugabhoga (melody based) and Mundige (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many Dasas (devotees) by <b>virtue</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote Gadugina Bharata, a translation of the epic Mahabharata. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars {{in the court of}} Devaraya II.

French-speaking men already in the army were attached to the unit to act as interpreters and assist with coordination and tactical instruction.
