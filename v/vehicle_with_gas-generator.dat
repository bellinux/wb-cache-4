40|$|Computer {{models of}} rocket engines and single-stage-to-orbit {{vehicles}} that {{were developed by}} the authors at DFVLR and NASA have been combined. The resulting code consists of engine mass, performance, trajectory and vehicle sizing models. The engine mass model includes equations for each subsystem and describes their dependences on various propulsion parameters. The engine performance model consists of multidimensional sets of theoretical propulsion properties and a complete thermodynamic analysis of the engine cycle. The vehicle analyses include an optimized trajectory analysis, mass estimation, and vehicle sizing. A vertical-takeoff, horizontal-landing, single-stage, winged, manned, fully reusable <b>vehicle</b> <b>with</b> a payload capability of 13. 6 Mg (30, 000 lb) to low earth orbit was selected. Hydrogen, methane, propane, and dual-fuel engines were studied <b>with</b> staged-combustion, <b>gas-generator,</b> dual bell, and the dual-expander cycles.

After every 10 runs the proportional use of lanes was as designed. For example, after 10 runs the <b>vehicles</b> <b>with</b> studded tyres had used the test lanes 4, 3, 2, 1 and 0 times and the <b>vehicles</b> <b>with</b> unstudded tyres had used the respective lanes 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 times.

The relationship between structural interaction and the strength of the crossbeam in frontal car-to-car impacts is investigated. Car-to-car impact simulations are carried out between <b>vehicles</b> <b>with</b> modified crossbeam strength against <b>vehicles</b> <b>with</b> the original crossbeam strength.
