40|$|Objective: To isolate and {{identify}} microflora and fungal species at different phases during estrus synchronization of ewes and estimate their prevalence; compare {{the effectiveness of}} antimicrobial administration to intravaginal sponge on {{the changes in the}} vaginal microorganisms and reproductive performance. Methods: Sixty Egyptian ewes were allocated into three equal groups (G: 1, 2 and 3). G 1 was inserted with <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponge</b> containing medroxyprogesterone acetate and served as control; without antimicrobial additive. The other two groups were treated as G 1, but sponges were previously injected with ciprofloxacin (G 2), while sponges of G 3 were injected with ciprofloxacin and clotrimazole. Vaginal swabs were collected from each treated ewe, prior sponge insertion, at sponge withdrawal and 48 h later for microbiological investigation and bacterial count. On the day of sponge removal, 300 IU/eCG was administered for each treated ewe. The identified bacterial strains before sponge insertion were tested for sensitivity with antimicrobial disks. Results: Bacterial isolates before sponge insertion were more sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Frequencies of ewes in estrus; the interval from sponge withdrawal to onset estrus and the duration of estrus were statistically similar among treated groups. The pregnancy rate in G 2 (100. 0 %) was higher than G 1 (66. 7 %) and G 3 (82. 4 %). The total bacterial count before sponge insertion was similar between all treatments and increased significantly in all groups on the day of sponge withdraw. The prevailing bacteria on D 0, D 14 and 48 h after sponge removal for all treated groups were Staphylococcus spp. followed by Escherichia coli. Regarding to fungus species, percentages of isolation increased from 5. 00 % (before sponge insertion) to 100. 00 % and 88. 89 % at sponge withdraw for G 1 and G 2, respectively.

40|$|Background: Artificial {{insemination}} is {{an established}} and viable technique {{to accelerate the}} genetic advancement and economic return of the cattle. However, compromises the efficiency of detection of estrus results in low insemination rates. To avoid these problems in beef herd, synchronization protocols have been developed that allow inseminate large number of animals within a set period of time. These treatments are known as protocols for synchronization of ovulation for fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI). There are several slow-release progesterone or progestins devices {{on the market for}} use in synchronization of estrus/ovulation programs in cattle, but these devices have a high cost, which results in less use of these protocols by farmers. This study aimed to determine the follicular dynamic of a low cost protocol to synchronize ovulation, which uses vaginal sponges impregnated with medroxy-progesterone acetate (MPA; group 1) and compare it with two trade protocols (groups 2 and 3). Materials, Methods & Results: Nine Braford cows, multiparous non-lactating, cyclic and BCS > 3 (BCS = 1 extremely lean cows and BCS = 5 obese cows) where used in these trial. The animals were divided into three treatments, which all animals went for three treatments in four replicates. (Continue 0 Group 1 (n = 14), animals received on day 0, a <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponge</b> impregnated with 250 mg MPA and an intramuscular (i. m.) application of 2 mg of estradiol benzoate (EB); on day 8, the <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponge</b> was removed and applied i. m. 0. 5 mg cloprostenol and 24 h latter was applied i. m. 1 mg of EB. Group 2 (n = 7), the animals received on day 0, a silicone vaginal implant with 1 g of progesterone and an application i. m. of 2 mg of EB; on day 8, the implant was removed and applied i. m. 0. 5 mg cloprostenol and 24 h latter was applied i. m. 1 mg of EB. Group 3 (n = 8), the animals received on day 0, a silicone ear implant impregnated with 3 mg norgestomet and an application i. m. of 3 mg norgestomet and 5 mg of estradiol valerate; on the 9 th day the implant was removed. From day 0, animals were examined daily by trans-rectal ultrasound with an 8 MHz linear transducer to monitor follicular and luteal dynamics. After removal of the implant in group 3 and after application of 1 mg EB in the other groups, the animals were evaluated by ultrasound two times per day until ovulation was detected. In group 1, seven animals lost a <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponge</b> impregnated with MPA and the data were removed from analysis. The emergence of follicular wave for groups 1, 2 and 3 occurred, respectively, 3. 7 ± 1. 1, 3. 7 ± 0. 7 and 4. 9 ± 1. 1 days, with a statistical trend (P < 0. 06) to occur earlier in groups 1 and 2 than in group 3. There was no statistical difference between groups in other variables. The interval between wave emergence and ovulation occurred in 7. 4 ± 0. 9, 7. 3 ± 0. 7 and 7. 6 ± 1. 3 days (P = 0. 82); the interval between implant removal and ovulation occurred in 66 ± 12, 66 ± 0 and 70. 5 ± 12. 7 hours (P = 0. 62); the dominant follicle diameter at implant removal was 10. 9 ± 2. 6, 12. 7 ± 2. 1 and 10. 3 ± 2. 1 mm (P = 0. 13); and the larger diameter of the dominant follicle was 15. 3 ± 2. 9, 16. 6 ± 1. 3 and 15. 9 ± 1. 5 mm (P = 0. 49) for groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

The aim of the present study was to test for mt/ROS colocalization in oocytes recovered from superovulated adult ewes and examined after in vivo or in vitro maturation (IVM). Cumulus–oocyte complexes of 8 superovulated (fluorogestone acetate þ D-cloprostenol for oestrus synchronization, pFSH/pLH and eCG for superovulation) adult (2 to 8 years of age) ewes were recovered (ovariohysterectomy by midventral laparotomy performed 54 h after <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponge</b> removal) either from flushing oviducts (oviducal oocytes) or from ovarian growing follicles (1 – 5 mm in diameter; follicular oocytes). Follicular oocytes were analysed after IVM (Ambruosi et al. 2009 Theriogenology 71, 1093 – 1104). After cumulus cell removal, all oocytes underwent nuclear chromatin, mt, and ROS evaluation. Hoechst 33258 and Mitotracker Orange CMTM Ros were used to label nuclear chromatin and mt (Ambruosi et al. 2009) and 20, 70 -dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate was used for ROS labelling (Hashimoto et al. 2000 Mol. Reprod. Dev. 57, 353 – 360). Oocytes at the metaphase II (MII) stage showing regular ooplasmic size (4130 mm in diameter) and morphology were selected for confocal analysis of mt/ROS fluorescence distribution, intensity, and colocalization. Forty oviducal MII oocytes recovered from 8 ewes were analysed. Thirty-two oocytes recovered from the ovaries of 4 ewes underwent IVM, and 23 out of 32 (72 %) reached nuclear maturation and were analysed. The rate of oocytes showing perinuclear mt distribution pattern did not differ between oviducal and IVM oocytes (33 %, 13 / 40 v. 43 %, 10 / 23; not significant). In these oocytes, fluorescent intensity of mt labelling and intracellular ROS levels did not differ between oviducal and IVM ooocytes (996. 27 ` 363. 57 v. 798. 13 ` 275. 91; not significant; and 1808. 11 ` 442. 78 v. 1473. 29 ` 662. 49, for mt and ROS, respectively; not significant), whereas mt/ROS colocalization was significantly higher in ovulated oocytes than in IVM oocytes (Pearson coefficient 0. 67 ` 0. 11 v. 0. 39 ` 0. 19, respectively; P o 0. 001). In conclusion, in oocytes of adult ewes, mt aggregation, apparent energy status, and intracellular ROS levels do not differ between ovulated and IVM oocytes, but mt/ROS colocalization differs between the 2 groups. As it was reported for other cell systems that such a difference can be indicative of healthy status of ovulated oocytes, we suggest that mt/ROS colocalization could be considered as a suitable marker of oocyte quality...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine whether south Darfurdesert goats are seasonal breeders ornot. Furthermore, the ovulation time and LH surge were correlated with estrous onset. Three experiments were conducted. Experiment 1 was designed {{to determine whether or not}} there is a true seasonal pattern of ovarian cyclicity in the female desert goats. Fifteen female desert goats were used in this experiment. Ovarian cyclicity was monitored by measuring plasma progesterone concentration twice per weekfor one year. The results indicated that does were cycling during all the seasons of the year with a slight decrease in summer and winter. Experiment 2 was conducted to study the chronological relationships between estrus onset, time of LHsurge and ovulation time in does synchronized with chronogest or CIDR. Forty six desert goats were divided into 2 groups; they were assigned for estrous induction using intravaginal spongeor CIDR. At time of sponge or CIDR removal, the animals were injected with 300 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG). Observations for estrous to detect the onset and duration was carried out every 4 hours after sponge or CIDR removal. Blood samples for LH assay were collected at 0, 24, 28, 30, and 32 hours post sponge or CIDR removal. The ovaries were observed for x ovulation at 48, 50, 52 and 54 hours post sponge or CIDR removal. The results indicated that there was no significant difference in the estrus onset, estrous duration, ovulation time and time of LH surge in does synchronized with either chronogest or CIDR. Ovulation was detected 54 hours post sponges or CIDR removal. LH surge occurred 28 hours post removal ofsponge or CIDR. No significant difference was detected with regard to the time taken from oestrus onset to ovulation time in does synchronized with chronogest and CIDR (25. 4 and 23. 5 hours respectively). Also, there was no significant difference in the time taken from LHsurge to ovulation time in does synchronized with chronogest and CIDR (25. 6 and 25. 3 hours respectively). This finding of estrous onset, time of ovulation and the time of onset of the LH peak could be of great help in timing AI or mating for maximum conception in goat breeding programs when CIDR or sponges were usedwith 300 IU PMSG. Experiment three was designed to study the Effect of PMSG dose rate on estrous phase, LH pattern and ovulation time in does with estrous induced using chronogest. A total of 90 desert goats were used in this experiment. All does were treated with impregnated <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponge</b> containing 45 mg chronogest. At sponge removal, animals were divided randomly into 3 groups (A, B, and C) and assigned to differentPMSG doses (groupA, 300 IU, group B, 500 IU and group C, 700 IU). The interval betweenthe withdrawal of the sponges and estrus was 28. 9, 28. 8 and 28. 2 hours, respectively. Estrus xi duration was 36. 0, 42. 0 and 42. 0 hours, respectively. There were no significant differences (P> 0. 05) between the treatment groups for the onset of estrus or estrus duration. The results ofthis experiment showed that ovulation was occurred 54 hours postremoval (HPR) in does synchronized using chronogest with 300 IU PMSG and 48 HPR in experimental desert goats synchronized using chronogest with 500 and 700 IU PMSG. LH surge reached 28 hours post removal, irrespective of the treatment. The chronological relationships between ovulation and estrous onset was significantly longer in does receiving 300 IU PMSG(25. 7 hours) compared with those injected with 500 or 700 IU PMSG (19. 2 and 19. 4 hours, respectively). There was no significant difference in the time taken from estrous onset to ovulation time in does injected with 500 compared with 700 IU PMSG. The time taken from LH surge to ovulation was significantly longer indoes receiving 300 IU PMSG (25. 5 hours) compared with those injected with 500 or 700 IU PMSG (19. 7 and 19. 8 hours, respectively). There was no significant difference in the time taken from LH surge to ovulation indoes injected with 500 compared with 700 IU PMSG. The results imply that the increasing doses of PMSG, following a 12 -day treatment with intravaginal sponges, significantly affect the ovulation time and chronological data in desert goat...|$|E

El ESP aplicado durante 8 d (n= 72) y 11 d (n= 71) no afectó la preñez de la IAS: 38 % y 42 % respectivamente, ni la preñez acumulada en 30 d: 56 % y 61 %, respectivamente (p 0. 05). Las multíparas (n= 83) tendieron a una mayor tasa de preñez respecto de las primíparas (n= 53) en la IAS: 39 % y 23 %, y también en la acumulada en 30 d: 46 % y 28 %, respectivamente (p A treatment {{based on}} progesterone impregnated vaginal sponges {{has been used}} to control breeding in suckled beef cows under grazing conditions. However, fertility has not always been satisfactory. The objective of this trial was to determine whether fertility of treated cows was affected by the following factors: parity and duration of treatment (exp. 1), presence of signs of oestrus at the moment of timed AI and duration of postpartum in anoestrus cows (exp. 2), the time for double timed AI and reduction to a single timed AI (exp. 3). Spring-calved suckled Angus cows 30 to 90 days (d) postpartum, in good body condition, were used. Cows received 10 mg of oestradiol benzoate i. m. and a <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponge</b> containing 2 g of progesterone (ESP treatment). Exp. 1. Parity (primiparous, n= 53 vs multiparous, n= 83) and duration of ESP (8 d, n= 72 vs 11 d, n= 71) were evaluated. Timed artificial inseminations were carried out 48 and 72 hs after sponge removal (AI-T). Pregnancy rates at AI-T and accumulated after 30 days of AI (pregnancy rate at day 30 = pregnancy at AI-T and at return to oestrus) were determined. Both factors did not interact (p 0. 05). ESP duration had no effect on pregnancy rate at AI-T and at day 30 : 38 vs 42 % and 56 vs 61 %, 8 vs 11 d respectively (p 0. 05). Multiparous cows tended to present higher pregnancy rates at AI-t and at day 30 : 39 vs 23 % and 46 vs 28 % (p < 0. 1) multiparous vs primiparous respectively. Exp. 2. Anoestrus multiparous cows (n= 124) were treated with ESP during 11 d. Procedures were similar to those in exp. 1. Oestrous rate was 24 % and it appeared between 36 and 48 hours after treatment. Pregnancy rate at AI-t was 53 and 44 % in oestrous cows and non oestrous cows (p 0. 05) while pregnancy rate at day 30 was 64 and 60 % respectively. In those cows in which exact parturition date was available no different pregnancy rate at AI-t was found when cows were treated between postpartum days 30 to 59 (n= 15), 60 to 89 (n= 28) or 90 to 145 (n= 20) : 57, 55. 3 and 52. 6 % respectively (p 0. 05). Exp. 3. Multiparous cows were treated with ESP during 11 d. The time for double AI-T had no effect on pregnancy rate: 38 % when inseminated either at 48 and 72 hs (n= 42) or 40 and 64 hs (n= 47). The amount of AI-T did not affect the pregnancy rate: 22 % with AI-T at 48 and 72 hs (n= 46) vs 29 % with one AI-T at 56 hs (n= 48) (p 0. 05). In no case was pregnancy rate at day 30 affected.

Progesterone analysis and transrectal examination were accomplished on the day of insemination, 20, 40, and 60 days afterwards. It was determined that on the 60 th day of pregnancy, the level of progesterone in sheep carrying two foetuses (26. 9 ± 5. 0 ng/mL) was higher (p< 0. 01) compared to that in sheep carrying just one foetus (20. 1 ± 3. 0 ng/mL). The specificity of the transrectal ultrasonography (84. 2 %) by the 40 th day of pregnancy was higher (p< 0. 05) than that of the progesterone assay (66. 5 %). The summarized data showed that measuring the progesterone levels by means of ELISA on the 20 th day after insemination could be used with success for diagnostics in pregnant and non-pregnant sheep.

40|$|Various {{molecules}} including steroids, prostaglandins, peptides and glycoproteins {{are largely}} used in reproduction programs in domestic mammals. Treatments including pituitary gonadotrophins (Follitropin —FSH-, Lutropin —LH-, human menopausal Gonadotrophin —hMG-) and placental gonadotrophins (human Chorionic Gonadotrophin —hCG-, equine Chorionic Gonadotrophin —eCG- also called Pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin —PMSG-) {{are used for}} a long time to treat infertility or as a way to better control the reproductive cycles of cattle, horses, goats, sheep, dogs, pigs and more recently rabbits, monkeys and humans. The literature concerning the administration of gonadotrophins in different species than source species reports data’s on active immunization and suggests that repeated administration of these hormones lead to induction of antibodies. In this aim, we realized experimental investigations in different ruminant species in order to get objective informations and experimental observations on possible side effects of repeated xenogenic gonadotrophic treatments as circulating antibodies in plasma and decreased response to repeated administration. In this aim, we recorded reproductive performances in parallel with measurement of circulating antibodies in plasma using an in vitro radiometric method. So, ninety-eight goats of two herds were followed over 4 years in a program of annual artificial insemination after estrus induction/synchronization, including progestagen administration (<b>vaginal</b> <b>sponge)</b> followed by prostaglandin analog and equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) 48 h before sponge removal. After withdrawal of progestagen, goats were sampled every 4 hours for determination of LH surge and tested for estrus by the presence of a buck. Seven days after AI, endoscopic examination of the ovaries was performed while plasma progesterone was used at day 21 - 22 after AI for early pregnancy diagnosis. Finally, echography was performed at day 40 - 45, before monitoring parturition, number and sex of kids. All the goats were sampled before and after each treatment, for anti-eCG antibodies screening. Statistical analysis of the results clearly established a significant effect of the treatments on anti-eCG antibodies while no effect of the herd or of the age of the female. A significant difference was found between the two herds when the delay for coming out of estrus or for LH surge was considered. The antibodies significantly influenced the time of coming out of estrus as well as the time of LH surge. No influence of the age at the first treatment on the time of estrus or the time of LH surge was found. The antibodies after treatment significantly influenced the percentage of ovulating females as well as kidding rate, whatever the age of the female. Finally, no effect of antibodies on prolificacy was found even if antibodies significantly influenced the fertility. In the following experimental protocol, we verified the possible effect of high frequency of administration on the immune response to eCG. The profiles of eCG binding rate, in the blood of cows submitted weekly for 5 to 10 weeks to repeated high doses (1000 - 2000 IU) of equine chorionic gonadotrophin in an ovum pick up experimental protocol were followed. The profiles clearly indicated a marked increase of eCG binding rate after 3 to 5 injections of the exogenous hormone to the females. The statistical analysis of the results established that treatments induced a significant increase in binding rates after 6 and 3 injections according to the group. These binding rates remained elevated for at least 1 week following the last injection and decreased afterwards. The values of plasma binding rates following repeated eCG administration differed significantly between groups and from one cow to another with some cows presenting no significant immune response while others were more reactive against the hormone. Finally, the experiment on sheep consisted in the estimation of the long-term consequences on reproduction performance, of the oestrus synchronization treatments that are annually applied to ewes. In this aim, nine dairy flocks were followed. An hormonal treatment combining the insertion of a vaginal fluoro-gestone acetate (FGA) sponge for 14 days and the injection of about 500 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) at withdrawal was applied to the ewes in seven of the nine flocks. Females of the two other flocks were used as controls. Blood samples were taken from each female just before the treatment (to test for the presence of residual antibodies) and 20 days after the PMSG injection. Anti-PMSG antibody binding rates were calculated for each blood sample. The residual binding rate increased with age and induce negative effects on the following years reproduction performances, i. e., they increased the probability that the ewes would not become pregnant...|$|E

A total of 94 LOPU sessions were performed on 33 adult goats of the Saanen and Alpine breeds. Females were synchronized (Day 0) during the nonbreeding season by inserting <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponges</b> (45 mg of fluorogestone acetate, Intervet, Boxmeer, The Netherlands). At Day 8, an i. m. injection of 50 μg of cloprostenol (Estrumate; Schering-Plough Animal Health, Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada) was administered. Porcine FSH (Stimufol, Merial, Brussels, Belgium, 160 mg/goat) was administered in 5 injections at 12 -h intervals, starting on Day 8. The LOPU took place under general anesthesia on Day 11, and follicles ≥ 2 mm were aspirated with an 18 -gauge needle connected to a controlled vacuum system. <b>Vaginal</b> <b>sponges</b> were removed at the time of LOPU. Treatments were repeated 2 times in a 2 -week interval scheme (2 goats and 1 goat were excluded from the experiment during the second and third LOPU sessions, respectively). Cumulus–oocyte complexes were washed and evaluated for quality (graded from 1 to 3). Oocytes recovered from unstimulated slaughterhouse-derived ovaries served as a control. Cumulus–oocytes complexes from Grades 1 and 2 were submitted to IVM in TCM- 199, supplemented with 100 μm of cysteamine and either 10 ng mL– 1 of epidermal growth factor (EGF) or 10 % follicular fluid and 100 ng mL– 1 of ovine FSH (FF-FSH). Matured oocytes were then submitted to IVF and in vitro development as described by Cognié et al. (2004 Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 16, 437 – 445). Over the 94 LOPU sessions, 20. 4 ± 0. 9 follicles were aspirated (mean ± SEM), allowing the recovery of 12. 3 ± 0. 7 COC per goat and per session, of which 80. 1 % were suitable for IVM (Grades 1 and 2). Results of in vitro production are detailed in the table. The IVM treatment did not significantly affect cleavage or blastocyst development rates in oocytes derived from slaughterhouse ovaries. Cleavage rates were significantly decreased in LOPU-derived oocytes when compared with control oocytes. For LOPU-derived oocytes, cleavage and final blastocyst development rates were increased significantly and kinetics of embryo development were accelerated when FF-FSH was used during IVM as compared with EGF. The IVM with FF-FSH allowed us to produce 4. 1 blatocysts per goat per LOPU session. These results demonstrate the interest in LOPU for goat embryo production once appropriate IVM treatment is used. The difference observed between LOPU and slaughterhouse oocytes in terms of response to IVM treatments may be related to FSH stimulation prior to the LOPU session or to postmortem changes in oocyte responsiveness in the slaughterhouse group.
