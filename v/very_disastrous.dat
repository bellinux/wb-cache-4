2500|$|Beginning {{at the end}} of July {{and ending}} on August 2, 1914, the Armenian {{congress}} at Erzurum was a watershed event between the Ottoman government (Committee of Union and Progress) and Ottoman Armenian citizens. The conversation between groups were established with the Armenian liaisons Simon Vratsian, Arshak Vramian, Rostom (Stepan Zorian), and E. Aknouni (Khatchatour Maloumian) and Ottoman liaisons Dr. Behaeddin Shakir, Omer Naji (Omer Naci), and Hilmi Bey, also accompanied by an international entourage of peoples from the Caucasus. Committee of Union and Progress requested from Ottoman Armenians to facilitate the conquest of Transcaucasia by inciting a rebellion (with the Russian Armenians) against the tsarist army {{in the event of a}} Caucasus Campaign. The Ottoman plan was to draw the Persians, Kurds, Tatars and Georgians into a holy war against the Allies. [...] In order to carry this project it was necessary to make sure that Armenian geographical position would not hamper cooperation between these races. If this agreement went forward and the Ottoman Armenians did not support the Russians, they would be offered autonomy. This offer was one step forward from Armenian reform package, which was already established in February 1914. [...] The Tsar promised autonomy for Russian Armenia. A representative meeting of Russian Armenians assembled in Tiflis, Caucasus, during August 1914. The Tsar promised autonomy to six Turkish Armenian vilayets as well as the two Russian-Armenian provinces. Tsar asked Armenian's loyalty and support for Russia in the conflict. The proposal was agreed upon and nearly 200,000 Armenians, Armenian volunteer units, served with the Russian colors. The Armenians were quite willing to remain loyal to their government, but declared their inability to agree to the other proposal, that of inciting their compatriots under Russian rule to insurrection. In spite of these promises and threats, the executive committee of the ARF informed the Turks that the Armenians could not accept the Turkish proposal, and on their behalf advised the Turks not to participate in the present war, which would be <b>very</b> <b>disastrous</b> to the Turks themselves.|$|E
2500|$|On December 6, 1862 Fagan's brigade {{arrived at}} Morrow’s and {{controlled}} all the approaches to Cane Hill {{from the south}} and east. Hindman then learned of the approach of General Herron, who had two divisions just north of Fayetteville. Hindman planned to get behind the Federal division of General Blunt and prevent General Herron’s division from combining with Gen. Blunt. Upon reaching the high ground at Prairie Grove on December 7, Hindman’ s army formed on ridge overlooking Crawford Prairie and Fagan's brigade was advanced to a position fifty yards from the Borden Orchard. The position was very good and there the army waited for Herron to advance. Brook’s regiment was posted behind an artillery battery. Around 2:00 pm the artillery duel started. Blocher’s Battery, which was part of Fagan's brigade became a lightning rod for Federal artillery and later infantry. The 20th Wisconsin advanced to take the battery and when their right flank was 50 yards away from their Brook’s 34th Arkansas rose and fired into them. The regiment was ordered forward along with Chew’s Arkansas Infantry Battalion and Hawthorne’s regiment. The 20th Wisconsin was driven back and the battery was retaken. As the Confederate counterattack came off the ridge and onto the prairie they came under heavy fire and retreated to their position in the ravine. As the Confederates were reorganizing another Federal attack was launched. This time the 37th Illinois advanced to the summit. Again the Fagan's brigade rose out of the scrub and fired a point blank volley and charged. The two forces locked in hand-to-hand fighting. Again the Confederates followed the retreating Federals and ran into heavy fire. As the brigade resumed their position on the summit, the tempo of the battle slowed and shifted {{to another part of the}} battlefield. They stayed in position until nearly midnight when the order to retreat came. During the march over the Boston Mountains many of the men deserted to their homes. In April 1862, Colonel King wrote home to his mother and had this to say about the regiment, [...] "The fight at Prairie Grove notwithstanding. We whipped it proved to be a <b>very</b> <b>disastrous</b> one to us. My loss in the fight was a very heavy one. I lost one hundred and thirty two men, killed and wounded out of less than five hundred men. I still have a fine Regt. and am ready for another fight.

60|$|As the {{engineer}} pondered {{the prospect of}} deliverance, his thoughts led him rather to despair than to hope. There were thirty-two persons in all upon the rock that day, with only two boats, which, even in good weather, could not unitedly accommodate more than twenty-four sitters.

Under these circumstances he felt that to despatch one of the boats in expectation of either working the Smeaton sooner up to the rock, or in hopes of getting her boat brought to their assistance would, besides being useless, at once alarm the workmen, each of whom would probably insist upon taking to his own boat, and leaving the eight men of the Smeaton to their chance. A scuffle might ensue, and he knew well that when men are contending for life the results may be <b>very</b> <b>disastrous.</b>|$|E

40|$|This article {{documents}} the sizable forecast errors {{that have been}} made in relation to the economic recession in Greece by major policy-shaping international organizations, as well as Greek research centres and the Greek government.

The authors look into the predictions made at the beginning of 2013 for each GDP component and estimate what might happen under the worst, best and medium case scenario predictions regarding each component. They also analyse the available macroeconomic figures using both the autoregressive integrated moving average model and traditional macroeconomic models and find that any prediction regarding the Greek GDP contraction rate can lie in the 2. 9 - 7. 2 % range, which illustrates the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the predictions. To address the recession and help the economy return to growth, a number of policy recommendations are made. To ameliorate the technical forecast problem, a range of methodological improvements is needed...|$|R
40|$|The city of Christchurch, New Zealand, {{was until}} very {{recently}} a “Junior England”—a small city that still bore the strong imprint of nineteenth-century British colonization, alongside a growing interest in the underlying biophysical setting and the indigenous pre-European landscape. All of this has changed as {{the city has been}} subjected to a devastating series of earthquakes, beginning in September 2010, and still continuing, with over 12, 000 aftershocks recorded. One of these aftershocks, on February 22, 2011, was very close to the city center and <b>very</b> shallow with <b>disastrous</b> consequences, including a death toll of 185. Many buildings collapsed, and many more need to be demolished for safety purposes, meaning that over 80 percent of the central city will have gone. Tied up with this is the city’s precious heritage—its buildings and parks, rivers, and trees. The threats to heritage throw debates over economics and emotion into sharp relief. A number of nostalgic positions emerge from the dust and rubble, and in one form is a reverse-amnesia—an insistence of the past in the present. Individuals can respond to nostalgia in very different ways, at one extreme become mired in it and unable to move on, and at the other, dismissive of nostalgia as a luxury in the face of more pressing crises. The range of positions on nostalgia represent the complexity of heritage debates, attachment, and identity—and the ways in which disasters amplify the ongoing discourse on approaches to conservation and the value of historic landscapes...|$|R
60|$|However {{this may}} be, the {{campaign}} of Alexander of Epirus in Italy had a <b>very</b> <b>disastrous</b> termination. The occasion of his going there was a request which he had received from the inhabitants of Tarentum that he would come over and assist them in a war {{in which they were}} engaged with some neighboring tribes. Tarentum was a city situated toward the western shore of Italy. It was {{at the head of the}} deep bay called the Gulf of Tarentum, which bay occupies the hollow of the foot that the form of Italy presents to the eye as seen upon a map.[H] Tarentum was, accordingly, across the Adriatic Sea from Epirus. The distance was about two hundred miles. By taking a southerly route, and going up the Gulf of Tarentum, this distance might be traversed wholly by sea. A little to the north the Adriatic is narrow, the passage there being only about fifty miles across. To an expedition, however, taking this course, there would remain, after arriving on the Italian shore, fifty miles or more to be accomplished by land in order to reach Tarentum.|$|E

The natives learnt that our baggage could be plundered with impunity, and that even when taken red-handed in the act, the chances were that no punishment whatever would be inflicted. They naturally ascribed this conduct on our part to fear—for in Abyssinia the punishment for theft is very severe, the culprit frequently having his hand cut off—and were encouraged to plunder accordingly. A moderate share of energy, one grain of common sense among the authorities at Senafe at this time, so that the first two or three offenders caught plundering our convoys in open day should have been flogged to {{within an inch of}} their lives, and plundering would have been put a stop to at once and for ever; and a very great many lives, both of our own muleteers and of the natives themselves, would have been eventually saved.|$|E
60|$|The war which Mary {{had been}} drawn into with France, by Philip's threat {{that he would never}} see her again, proved <b>very</b> <b>disastrous.</b> The town of Calais, which is {{opposite}} to Dover, across the straits, and, of course, on the French side of the channel, had been in the possession of the English for two hundred years. It was very gratifying to English pride to hold possession of such a stronghold on the French shore; but now every thing seemed to go against Mary. Calais was defended by a citadel nearly as large as the town itself, and was deemed impregnable. In addition to this, an enormous English force was concentrated there. The French general, however, contrived, partly by stratagem, and partly by overpowering numbers of troops, and ships, and batteries of cannon, to get possession of the whole. The English nation were indignant at this result. Their queen and her government, so energetic in imprisoning and burning her own subjects at home, were powerless, it seemed, in coping with their enemies abroad. Murmurs of dissatisfaction were heard every where, and Mary sank down upon her sick bed overwhelmed with disappointment, vexation, and chagrin. She said that she should die, and that if, after her death, they examined her body, they would find Calais like a load upon her heart.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{assassination}} of Greene, Sinito became heavily involved in the drug trade. The underworld war with Greene and his subsequent assassination resulted in a massive federal crackdown {{that proved to be}} <b>very</b> costly and <b>disastrous</b> for the Cleveland family. Many high ranking mobsters were incarcerated and convicted for crimes related to the war, and the Cleveland family was losing {{a lot of money and}} potential profits due to these incidents. Determined to recover most of the profits lost, the Cleveland family soon turned to the previously taboo rackets of Narcotics trafficking. In spite of the official [...] "no drugs" [...] policy, Sinito engaged in drug trafficking for the family, and did so with the tacit approval of the imprisoned mob boss, James Licavoli. However, Licavoli's underboss, Angelo Lonardo, was totally opposed to drug dealing and unsuccessfully tried to steer Licavoli against it. [...] During this period, the Cleveland family was involved in a large-scale narcotics network that distributed and sold marijuana, cocaine, quaaludes, and other controlled substances. The narcotics network was overseen by Cleveland mobster, Carmen P. Zagaria, who was controlled in the operation by Sinito and another Capo, Joseph Charles Gallo. In spite of his Italian-American heritage and deep involvement in business dealings with the Cleveland family, Zagaria refused Gallo's offer to be [...] "made" [...] into the family, with the rank of a Caporegime. It is estimated that in 1981 alone, Zagaria's drug network brought in approximately $15 million and was considered the largest narcotics network in northeast Ohio.|$|R
40|$|A {{disaster}} can {{be defined}} as any unforeseen or sudden situation that the affected community is unable to cope with or an event when natural hazards interact with existing conditions so that they disrupt the ability of a community to feed and care for their families. The natural hazards become disasters when the disruptions exceed the adjustment capacity of the community. We continually modify our living environment and thus increase the chances of disasters occurring. Papua New Guinea, with areas of steep land, high rainfall, large rural populations and limited government capacity to monitor and deal with natural hazards, is <b>very</b> vulnerable to <b>disastrous</b> events which put the population and infrastructure at risk. This is particularly so for areas in the PNG highlands, such as Simbu province, where population and land pressure make it difficult for rural subsistence farmers to maintain sustainable farming practices. They have a very limited capacity to generate income to purchase inputs {{that could be used to}} maintain the productivity of their land and thus any additional difficulty can have a disastrous effect on their ability to cope. The government has a very limited capacity to provide them with relief of any kind. Throughout the world, developers and governments are learning that local people must be allowed to formulate solutions to their problems themselves, rather than having solutions imposed on them. Vetiver grass technology (VGT), because it is low cost, provides a partial long-term solution to soil degradation, fits in with traditional technologies farmers are familiar with, can be controlled and managed by farmers and is proven to work under such conditions, fits in well with attempts to make life easier and more sustainable for the at-risk rural population in disaster-prone areas...|$|R
60|$|And {{the effect}} of this breach of the Constitution at the present day has been <b>very</b> <b>disastrous.</b> It has taught those who have not been close {{observers}} of the American struggle to believe that, after all, the Americans are indifferent as to their liberties. Such pranks have been played before high heaven by men utterly unfitted for the use of great power, as have scared all the nations. Mr. Lincoln, the President by whom this unconstitutional act has been done, apparently delegated his assumed authority to his minister, Mr. Seward. Mr. Seward has reveled in the privilege of unrestrained arrests, and has locked men up with reason and without. He has instituted passports and surveillance; and placed himself at the head of an omnipresent police system with all the gusto of a Fouche, though luckily without a Fouche's craft or cunning. The time will probably come when Mr. Seward must pay for this--not with his life or liberty, but with his reputation and political name. But in the mean time his lettres de cachet have run everywhere through the States. The pranks which he played were absurd, and the arrests which he made were grievous. After awhile, when it became manifest that Mr. Seward had not found a way to success, when it was seen that he had inaugurated no great mode of putting down rebellion, he apparently lost his power in the cabinet. The arrests ceased, the passports were discontinued, and the prison doors were gradually opened. Mr. Seward was deposed, not from the cabinet, but from the premiership of the cabinet. The suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus was not countermanded, but the operation of the suspension was allowed to become less and less onerous; and now, in April, 1862, within a year of the commencement of the suspension, it has, I think, nearly died out. The object in hand now is rather that of getting rid of political prisoners than of taking others.|$|E
6000|$|Altogether {{different}} in character was that Triestine, who came one evening {{to be helped}} home {{at the close of}} a <b>very</b> <b>disastrous</b> career in Mexico. He Was a person of innumerable bows, and fluttered his bright-colored compliments about, till it appeared that never before had such amiable people been asked charity by such a worthy and generous sufferer. In Trieste he had been a journalist, and it was evident enough from his speech that he was of a good education. He was vain of his Italian accent, which was peculiarly good for his heterogeneously peopled native city; and he made a show of that marvelous facility of the Triestines in languages, by taking me down French books, Spanish books, German books, and reading from them all with the properest accent. Yet with this boyish pride and self-satisfaction there was mixed a tone of bitter and worldly cynicism, a belief in fortune as the sole providence. As nearly as I could make out, he was a Johnson man in American politics; upon the Mexican question he was independent, disdaining French and Mexicans alike. He was with the former from the first, and had continued in the service of Maximilian after their withdrawal, till the execution of that prince made Mexico no place for adventurous merit. He was now going back to his native country, an ungrateful land enough, which had ill treated him long ago, but to which he nevertheless returned in a perfect gayety of temper. What a light-hearted rogue he was,--with such merry eyes, and such a pleasant smile shaping his neatly trimmed beard and mustache! After he had supped, and he Stood with us at the door taking leave, something happened to be said of Italian songs, whereupon this blithe exile, whom the compassion of strangers was enabling to go home after many years of unprofitable toil and danger to a country that had loved him not, fell to caroling a Venetian barcarole, and went sweetly away in its cadence. I bore him company as far as the gate of another Italian-speaking signor, and was there bidden adieu with great effusion, so that I forgot till he had left me to charge him not to be in fear of the house-dog, which barked but did not bite. In calling this after him, I had the misfortune to blunder in my verb. A man of another nation--perhaps another man of his own nation-- would have cared rather for what I said than how I said it; but he, as if too zealous for the honor of his beautiful language to endure a hurt to it even in that moment of grief, lifting his hat, and bowing for the last time, responded with a [...] "Morde, non morsica, signore!" [...] and passed in under the pines, and next day to Italy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'All {{the events}} of that night have a great importance, since they brought about a {{situation}} which remained unchanged till Jim's return. Jim had been away in the interior for more than a week, and it was Dain Waris who had directed the first repulse. That brave and intelligent youth ("who knew how to fight after the manner of white men") wished to settle the business off-hand, but his people were too much for him. He had not Jim's racial prestige and the reputation of invincible, supernatural power. He was not the visible, tangible incarnation of unfailing truth and of unfailing victory. Beloved, trusted, and admired as he was, he was still one of them, while Jim was one of us. Moreover, the white man, a tower of strength in himself, was invulnerable, while Dain Waris could be killed. Those unexpressed thoughts guided the opinions of the chief men of the town, who elected to assemble in Jim's fort for deliberation upon the emergency, as if expecting to find wisdom and courage in the dwelling of the absent white man. The shooting of Brown's ruffians was so far good, or lucky, that there had been half-a-dozen casualties amongst the defenders. The wounded were lying on the verandah tended by their women-folk. The women and children from {{the lower part of the}} town had been sent into the fort at the first alarm. There Jewel was in command, very efficient and high-spirited, obeyed by Jim's [...] "own people," [...] who, quitting in a body their little settlement under the stockade, had gone in to form the garrison. The refugees crowded round her; and through the whole affair, to the <b>very</b> <b>disastrous</b> last, she showed an extraordinary martial ardour. It was to her that Dain Waris had gone at once at the first intelligence of danger, for you must know that Jim was the only one in Patusan who possessed a store of gunpowder. Stein, with whom he had kept up intimate relations by letters, had obtained from the Dutch Government a special authorisation to export five hundred kegs of it to Patusan. The powder-magazine was a small hut of rough logs covered entirely with earth, and in Jim's absence the girl had the key. In the council, held at eleven o'clock in the evening in Jim's dining-room, she backed up Waris's advice for immediate and vigorous action. I am told that she stood up by the side of Jim's empty chair at the head of the long table and made a warlike impassioned speech, which for the moment extorted murmurs of approbation from the assembled headmen. Old Doramin, who had not showed himself outside his own gate for more than a year, had been brought across with great difficulty. He was, of course, the chief man there. The temper of the council was very unforgiving, and the old man's word would have been decisive; but it is my opinion that, well aware of his son's fiery courage, he dared not pronounce the word. More dilatory counsels prevailed. A certain Haji Saman pointed out at great length that [...] "these tyrannical and ferocious men had delivered themselves to a certain death in any case. They would stand fast on their hill and starve, or they would try to regain their boat and be shot from ambushes across the creek, or they would break and fly into the forest and perish singly there." [...] He argued that by the use of proper stratagems these evil-minded strangers could be destroyed without the risk of a battle, and his words had a great weight, especially with the Patusan men proper. What unsettled the minds of the townsfolk was the failure of the Rajah's boats to act at the decisive moment. It was the diplomatic Kassim who represented the Rajah at the council. He spoke very little, listened smilingly, very friendly and impenetrable. During the sitting messengers kept arriving every few minutes almost, with reports of the invaders' proceedings. Wild and exaggerated rumours were flying: there was a large ship at the mouth of the river with big guns and many more men--some white, others with black skins and of bloodthirsty appearance. They were coming with many more boats to exterminate every living thing. A sense of near, incomprehensible danger affected the common people. At one moment there was a panic in the courtyard amongst the women; shrieking; a rush; children crying--Haji Sunan went out to quiet them. Then a fort sentry fired at something moving on the river, and nearly killed a villager bringing in his women-folk in a canoe together with the best of his domestic utensils and a dozen fowls. This caused more confusion. Meantime the palaver inside Jim's house went on in the presence of the girl. Doramin sat fierce-faced, heavy, looking at the speakers in turn, and breathing slow like a bull. He didn't speak till the last, after Kassim had declared that the Rajah's boats would be called in because the men were required to defend his master's stockade. Dain Waris in his father's presence would offer no opinion, though the girl entreated him in Jim's name to speak out. She offered him Jim's own men in her anxiety to have these intruders driven out at once. He only shook his head, after a glance or two at Doramin. Finally, when the council broke up it had been decided that the houses nearest the creek should be strongly occupied to obtain the command of the enemy's boat. The boat itself was not to be interfered with openly, so that the robbers on the hill should be tempted to embark, when a well-directed fire would kill most of them, no doubt. To cut off the escape of those who might survive, and to prevent more of them coming up, Dain Waris was ordered by Doramin to take an armed party of Bugis down the river to a certain spot ten miles below Patusan, and there form a camp on the shore and blockade the stream with the canoes. I don't believe for a moment that Doramin feared the arrival of fresh forces. My opinion is that his conduct was guided solely by his wish to keep his son out of harm's way. To prevent a rush being made into the town the construction of a stockade was to be commenced at daylight at the end of the street on the left bank. The old nakhoda declared his intention to command there himself. A distribution of powder, bullets, and percussion-caps was made immediately under the girl's supervision. Several messengers were to be dispatched in different directions after Jim, whose exact whereabouts were unknown. These men started at dawn, but before that time Kassim had managed to open communications with the besieged Brown.|$|E

The other Animorphs show up to rescue Jake and Rachel and barely escape from one of Visser Three's monstrous morphs. The next day, Rachel writes an anonymous note to Melissa, telling her that her father loves her more than ever, despite not being able to show it.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the Don Kalmyks also sided with the White Movement to preserve their Cossack lifestyle and proud traditions. As Don Cossacks, the Don Kalmyks first fought under White army General Anton Denikin and then under his successor, General Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel. Because the Don Cossack Host to which they belonged was the main center of the White Movement and of Cossack resistance, the battles were fought on Cossack lands and was <b>very</b> <b>disastrous</b> for the Don Cossacks as villages and entire regions changed hands repeatedly in a fratricidal conflict in which both sides committed terrible atrocities. The Don Cossacks, including the Don Kalmyks, experienced heavy military and civilian losses, either from the fighting itself or from starvation and disease induced by the war. Some argue that the Bolsheviks were guilty of the mass extermination of the Don Cossack people, killing an estimated 70 percent (or 700,000 persons) of the Don Cossack population (Heller and Nekrich, 1988:87).|$|E
5000|$|Beginning {{at the end}} of July {{and ending}} on August 2, 1914, the Armenian {{congress}} at Erzurum was a watershed event between the Ottoman government (Committee of Union and Progress) and Ottoman Armenian citizens. The conversation between groups were established with the Armenian liaisons Simon Vratsian, Arshak Vramian, Rostom (Stepan Zorian), and E. Aknouni (Khatchatour Maloumian) and Ottoman liaisons Dr. Behaeddin Shakir, Omer Naji (Omer Naci), and Hilmi Bey, also accompanied by an international entourage of peoples from the Caucasus. Committee of Union and Progress requested from Ottoman Armenians to facilitate the conquest of Transcaucasia by inciting a rebellion (with the Russian Armenians) against the tsarist army {{in the event of a}} Caucasus Campaign. The Ottoman plan was to draw the Persians, Kurds, Tatars and Georgians into a holy war against the Allies. [...] In order to carry this project it was necessary to make sure that Armenian geographical position would not hamper cooperation between these races. If this agreement went forward and the Ottoman Armenians did not support the Russians, they would be offered autonomy. This offer was one step forward from Armenian reform package, which was already established in February 1914. The Tsar promised autonomy for Russian Armenia. A representative meeting of Russian Armenians assembled in Tiflis, Caucasus, during August 1914. The Tsar promised autonomy to six Turkish Armenian vilayets as well as the two Russian-Armenian provinces. Tsar asked Armenian's loyalty and support for Russia in the conflict. The proposal was agreed upon and nearly 200,000 Armenians, Armenian volunteer units, served with the Russian colors. The Armenians were quite willing to remain loyal to their government, but declared their inability to agree to the other proposal, that of inciting their compatriots under Russian rule to insurrection. In spite of these promises and threats, the executive committee of the ARF informed the Turks that the Armenians could not accept the Turkish proposal, and on their behalf advised the Turks not to participate in the present war, which would be <b>very</b> <b>disastrous</b> to the Turks themselves.|$|E
5000|$|On December 6, 1862 Fagan's brigade {{arrived at}} Morrow’s and {{controlled}} all the approaches to Cane Hill {{from the south}} and east. Hindman then learned of the approach of General Herron, who had two divisions just north of Fayetteville. Hindman planned to get behind the Federal division of General Blunt and prevent General Herron’s division from combining with Gen. Blunt. Upon reaching the high ground at Prairie Grove on December 7, Hindman’ s army formed on ridge overlooking Crawford Prairie and Fagan's brigade was advanced to a position fifty yards from the Borden Orchard. The position was very good and there the army waited for Herron to advance. Brook’s regiment was posted behind an artillery battery. Around 2:00 pm the artillery duel started. Blocher’s Battery, which was part of Fagan's brigade became a lightning rod for Federal artillery and later infantry. The 20th Wisconsin advanced to take the battery and when their right flank was 50 yards away from their Brook’s 34th Arkansas rose and fired into them. The regiment was ordered forward along with Chew’s Arkansas Infantry Battalion and Hawthorne’s regiment. The 20th Wisconsin was driven back and the battery was retaken. As the Confederate counterattack came off the ridge and onto the prairie they came under heavy fire and retreated to their position in the ravine. As the Confederates were reorganizing another Federal attack was launched. This time the 37th Illinois advanced to the summit. Again the Fagan's brigade rose out of the scrub and fired a point blank volley and charged. The two forces locked in hand-to-hand fighting. Again the Confederates followed the retreating Federals and ran into heavy fire. As the brigade resumed their position on the summit, the tempo of the battle slowed and shifted {{to another part of the}} battlefield. They stayed in position until nearly midnight when the order to retreat came. During the march over the Boston Mountains many of the men deserted to their homes. In April 1862, Colonel King wrote home to his mother and had this to say about the regiment, [...] "The fight at Prairie Grove notwithstanding. We whipped it proved to be a <b>very</b> <b>disastrous</b> one to us. My loss in the fight was a very heavy one. I lost one hundred and thirty two men, killed and wounded out of less than five hundred men. I still have a fine Regt. and am ready for another fight. We have a very fine army here and will move in a few days but where to I can’t tell." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} story {{starts off}} with Shakthi (Ramya Krishnan) wanting {{to find her}} relatives and unite her mother with her uncle Vetrivel Annachi (Vijayakumar) and her father with her aunt Nagavalli (Vadivukkarasi) but in a tragic accident set up by Nagavalli, Shakthi's parents die and {{she is the only}} survivor. She returns to the serial after many episodes and marries Ponnurangam (Sai Kiran) but after a while, it is revealed that since the accident, Shakthi's twin sister, Archana IAS (Ramya Krishnan), separated from her a long time ago, has been acting as Shakthi. She did this because after the accident in which her parents died, Shakthi was very ill, so when she met her twin sister, Archana IAS, at the hospital for the first time, she asks her to act as Shakthi and defeat Nagavalli and protect her family. Archana wanted to reveal her true identity later, but when the police arrest her husband Ponnurangam for Archana's murder, she is forced to reveal that she is not Shakthi but Archana IAS. After this moment, Ponnurangam and many of the others in Shakthi's family start ignoring Archana and treating her as an outcast. She is forced to even do house chores. One day, Archana even refuses the Chennai collector post because Ponnurangam told her to do so. Meanwhile, Doctor Madhan (Sakthi Saravanan), who originally intended to marry Shakthi (actually Archana), but married Bhoomika (Sandhiya), dislikes Bhoomika and tries in many ways to first marry Supriya (Reshma) and then later Actress/ Gwaliyar Ilavarasi Myna (Sandhiya). He succeeds in marrying Myna even though Bhoomika has a child. Archana is also pregnant with twins, but Ponnurangam donates one of his daughters in the hospital to Solaiyamma (K.S. Jayalakshmi) and Krishna, husband of Rukmini, who has lost her child 6 times. He does this to save Rukmini's life. Solaiyamma later refuses to give him the child because she wants the 500 crores property of Rukmini. Ponnurangam is torn between getting his child back and telling Archana about all this. It is revealed that Bhoomika has been acting as Myna to win Madhan's affection and later Vasantha finds out and Bhoomika and Vasantha have a challenge to see who will make Madhan believe them. Currently, Shakthi lives in Singapore and helps Archana. Rukmini now knows the truth about her cunning mother-in-law and husband and is staying in Archana's house while making Solaiyamma and Krishna believe that she is in Singapore. Roja and Ramamani are trying to find this out. The court has ruled that Subashree is Archana's daughter and Solaiyamma didn't let Rukmini come into her house. Currently, Madhan and Vasantha are trying many ways to get rid of Bhoomika and Solaiyamma is trying to get the 500 crores property of Rukmini. Archana is also trying to protect her family from Kanchana. Now, Bhoomika has found her father because she looks exactly like her mother, Devika, who died 25 years ago. Ponnurangam has now become assistant commissioner due to Archana's work. Now, Madhan has turned good and wants Bhoomika to find a better life. Now Radha reenters the story and she is pregnant caused by Nandhakumar, who is engaged to Jothika. After a <b>very</b> <b>disastrous</b> marriage, Nandhakumar reluctantly marries Radha and Sarvesh marries Jothika. However Nandhakumar kidnaps Jothika, then Bhoomika, and even Sarvesh in his goal of marrying Jothika. He even creates a dupe of Jothika and erases Jothika and Sarvesh's memories. He fixes a girl from Andhra for Sarvesh, Radhika, whose brother Sudhan, shockingly looks exactly like Dr. Madhan. Nandhakumar is unable to marry Jothika as his many attempts are thwarted by Bhoomika, Radha, Archana, and Shakthi. One day, Velayudham reveals that Nandhakumar is not his son but was given to him 25 years ago by Thamba, an evil sorcerer. He has now come back for his son so he can destroy the Ammayi family but Bhoomika and Velayudham refuse as Nandhakumar should go to jail so Madhan can be released. When Bhoomika tells this to Archana, Thangamma is shocked and later reveals that Archana and Shakthi are the great-granddaughters of Ammayi and Thamba intends to destroy them. Later, Archana shoots Nandhakumar and he dies. Shakthi also gets married to DCP Keerthi's brother Sarath Narayanan. Keerthi intends to kill Sarath for what his father Nambikkai Narayanan did to her father Shankar Narayanan. Keerthi's mother comes back and Keerthi goes to jail.

Jeeva is the A.O. of P.S. hospital and the son-in-law of the chairman Suryamoorthy hates Jeeva for getting all the credit. He has a daughter Priya who loves the chairman's grandson Siddharth but Siddharth actually loves Jeeva's daughter Iniya. Archana goes to jail for shooting Sarath and Shakthi stands against her. In a mysterious murder, Radha dies and Bhoomika vows to find and kill whoever murdered her. Deepa's brother Sudhakar plans to kill Archana, Shakthi, Jeeva, Sarath, and Bhoomika.|$|E
