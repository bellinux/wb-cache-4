5|$|The affront at {{the heart}} of Show Boat is still very alive today. It begins with the book and its {{negative}} and one-dimensional images of Black people, and continues on through the colossal and deliberate omission of the Black experience, including the pain of a people traumatized by four centuries of attempted genocide and exploitation. Not to mention the appropriation of Black music for the profit of the <b>very</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> oppressed Blacks and Africans. All this continues to offend deeply. The ol' man river of racism continues to run through the history of these productions and is very much part of this (Toronto) production. It is part of the overwhelming need of white Americans and white Canadians to convince themselves of our inferiority – that our demands don't represent a challenge to them, their privilege and their superiority.|$|E

Where are we going to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the <b>very</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history, this is because History itself has become a dustbin. It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.|$|E

500|$|Joseph {{arrived in}} New York on July 7, 1888, and later that month preached his inaugural Sabbath sermon at Beth Hamedrash Hagodol. The speech {{attracted}} a huge crowd, with over 1,500 men {{crowded into the}} sanctuary, and thousands more outside. The police had to call extra reinforcements to control the throng, and to escort Joseph into the synagogue. Though he had been chosen, in part, for his [...] "fabulous skills as an orator", his speaking style and sermons, which had been so beloved in Europe, did not impress New York audiences.

George Shire expressed {{the view that}} there was [...] "a strong racist animus" [...] against Mugabe within Zimbabwe, and that this had typically been overlooked by Western media representations of the country. Mugabe has himself been accused of racism; John Sentamu, the Uganda-born Archbishop of York in the United Kingdom, called Mugabe [...] "the worst kind of racist dictator," [...] for having [...] "targeted the whites for their apparent riches". They have been denounced as racist against Zimbabwe's white minority. Tutu stated that Mugabe became [...] "increasingly insecure, he's hitting out. One just wants to weep. It's very sad." [...] South African President Nelson Mandela was also critical of Mugabe, referring {{to him as a}} politician who [...] "despise the <b>very</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> put [...] in power and think it's a privilege to be there for eternity".|$|E

500|$|Initially, Che {{was going}} to be made in English and was met with a strong {{interest}} in financing; however, when {{the decision was made to}} make it in Spanish and break it up into two films, the studios' pay-TV deals, which were for English-language product only, [...] "disappeared", according to Bickford, [...] "and, at that point, nobody wanted to step up". The director defended his decision to shoot almost all of the film in Spanish in an interview: [...] "You can't make a film with any level of credibility in this case unless it's in Spanish. I hope we're reaching a time where you go make a movie in another culture, that you shoot in the language of that culture. I'm hoping the days of that sort of specific brand of cultural imperialism have ended". Both films were financed without any American money or distribution deal; [...] Soderbergh remarked, [...] "It was very frustrating to know that this is a zeitgeist movie and that some of the <b>very</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> told me how much they now regret passing on Traffic passed on this one too". Foreign pre-sales covered $54 million of the $58 million budget. Wild Bunch, a French production, distribution and foreign sales company put up 75% of the budget for the two films, tapping into a production and acquisition fund from financing and investment company Continental Entertainment Capitol, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based Citigroup. Spain's Telecinco/Moreno Films supplied the rest of the budget.|$|E

Previously, models had been used as actors in historical narratives, but in Burial Courbet said he [...] "painted the <b>very</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had been present at the interment, all the townspeople".

2500|$|By October 4, {{economist}} Richard Wolff {{commented that}} the unclear shape of the movement is [...] "mostly irrelevant" [...] {{at this early stage}} and the priority should be to invite all interested parties.

[...] Michael Daly, of Newsweek and The Daily Beast characterized the position of the protesters as a [...] "feeling that there is just a fundamental unfairness.

2500|$|French {{anthropologist}} Claude Lévi-Strauss's structuralist anthropology {{brought together}} ideas of Boas (especially Boas's {{belief in the}} mutability of cultural forms, and Bastian's belief in the psychic unity of humankind) and French sociologist's Émile Durkheim's focus on social structures (institutionalized relationships among persons and groups of persons). Instead of making generalizations that applied to large numbers of societies, Lévi-Strauss sought to derive from concrete cases increasingly abstract models of human nature. [...] His method begins with the supposition that culture exists in two different forms: the many distinct structures that could be inferred from observing {{members of the same}} society interact (and of which members of a society are themselves aware), and abstract structures developed by analyzing shared ways (such as myths and rituals) members of a society represent their social life (and of which members of a society are not only not consciously aware, but which moreover typically stand in opposition to, or negate, the social structures of which people are aware). [...] He then sought to develop one universal mental structure that could only be inferred through the systematic comparison of particular social and cultural structures. [...] He argued that just as there are laws through which a finite and relatively small number of chemical elements could be combined to create a seemingly infinite variety of things, there were a finite and relatively small number of cultural elements which people combine to create the great variety of cultures anthropologists observe. [...] The systematic comparison of societies would enable an anthropologist to develop this cultural [...] "table of elements," [...] and once completed, this table of cultural elements would enable an anthropologist to analyze specific cultures and achieve insights hidden to the <b>very</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> produced and lived through these cultures. [...] Structuralism came to dominate French anthropology and, in the late 1960s and 1970s, came to have great influence on American and British anthropology.|$|E
