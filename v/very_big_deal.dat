Shows in Gothenburg, Amsterdam and Milan sold out {{reasonably}} fast, with second dates being added in each city; those also sold out quickly. In The Netherlands, demand rendered all of KPN's 0900 paid service numbers unreachable. The nearly 90,000 tickets for the opening concert in Barcelona were sold in 54 minutes, establishing a new record for concerts in Spain.

However, when he rushes to the hospital to learn how he is doing, Oliver is not allowed to know any details about Christian's condition as he's not a relative. When Christian goes to Sebastian von Lahnstein to file documents to fix any future health concerns for them hospital-wise as a couple, Miriam suggests marriage to Oliver as an easy fix who responds with excitement to propose to Christian and begins making plans for a romantic proposal.

40|$|Objective – To {{determine}} if “Big Deal” journal subscription packages are a cost-effective {{way to provide}} electronic journal access to academic library users versus individual subscriptions, pay-per-view, and interlibrary loans (ILL). Design – Cost-per-article-use analysis. Setting – Public research university in the United States of America. Subjects – Cost-per-use data from 1) journals in seven <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> packages, 2) individually subscribed journals, 3) pay-per-view from publishers’ websites, and 4) interlibrary loans. Methods – The authors determined cost-per-use for <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> titles by utilizing COUNTER JR 1 metric Successful Full-Text Article Request (SFTAR) reports. Individual journal subscription cost-per-use data were obtained from individual publishers or platforms. Pay-per-view cost was determined by recording the price listed on publishers’ websites. ILL cost-per-use was established by reviewing cost-per-article obtained from libraries outside of reciprocal borrowing agreement networks. With the exception of pay-per-view numbers, title cost-per-use was averaged {{over a three-year period}} from 2010 through 2012. Main Results – Cost-per-article use for journals from <b>Big</b> <b>Deals</b> varied from 2. 11 to 9. 42. For individually subscribed journals, the average cost-per-article ranged from 0. 25 to 84. 00. Pay-per-view charges ranged from 15. 00 to 80. 00, with an average cost of 37. 72. Conclusion – The authors conclude that <b>Big</b> <b>Deals</b> are cost effective, but that they consume such a large amount of funds that they limit the purchase of other resources. The authors go on to outline the options for libraries thinking about <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> packages. First, libraries should keep <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> packages in place if the average cost-per-article is less than individual subscriptions. Second, libraries could subscribe only to the most-used journals in <b>Big</b> <b>Deals,</b> cancel the packages, and rely on ILL and pay-per-view access.

The first author of Jerry Cotton had grown tired of his creation and of writing pulp fiction in general. Höber became his successor and led Jerry Cotton to new heights. He worked diligently on the new stories and driven by his ambitions to walk in the footsteps of Karl May he did not only a <b>very</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> of research on the FBI and on New York, but also invented an American Indian sidekick called Zeerokah for Jerry Cotton. But in opposite to Karl May he didn't reach any fame because allegedly the G-man Jerry Cotton wrote all his tales himself. Also Höber received only an all-inclusive fee for each novel, not considering the amplitude of the publisher's profit. So Heinz Werner Höber followed his cherished idol Karl May another time by meeting his own publisher at court. He demanded recognition as the main author of Jerry Cotton and {{a significant part of the}} profit. Since he was neither the actual creator of Jerry Cotton nor at any time the only author of this series (although he was considered the probably most productive and certainly most committed of the altogether about 100 writers) and because he had never been promised to get named or to obtain royalties, the trial did not make him rich but ruined him. Still he had eventually reached a high profile, could publish books under his real name and won the highly accredited Glauser Award.|$|E

[...] Jussie Smollett, Television Critics Association Winter Preview (2015) Jamal's sexuality is a point of contention very early on for him and his father, while his mother sees the signs and loves him anyway. Lee Daniels made a conscious effort to remove the [...] "stereotype" [...] from Jamal's sexuality. [...] "Look... there are all different types of gay people" [...] Daniels remarked.

While Jamal's sexuality is known in his personal life, Ilene Chaiken explained that Jamal is [...] "coming out to the world which not everybody gets."
