40|$|Over {{the past}} few years there has been an {{increasing}} tendency to carry <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>IP</b> networks as opposed to the PSTN and other switched circuit networks. Initially this trend was favoured due to reduced costs but occurred at the expense of sacrificing the quality of the voice communications. Switched circuit networks have therefore remained the preferred carrier-grade voice communication network, but this is again changing. The advancement in improved quality of service (QoS) of real-time traffic on the IP network is a contributing factor to the anticipated future of the IP network supplying carrier-grade voice communications. Another contributing factor is the possibility of creating a new range of innovative, state-of-the-art telephony and communications services that acquire leverage through the intelligence and flexibility of the IP network. The latter has yet to be fully explored. Various protocols exist that facilitate the transport of voice and other media on IP networks. The most well known and widely supported of these is H. 323. This work presents and discusses H. 323 version 4 service creation. The work also categorises the various H. 323 services and presents the mechanisms provided by H. 323 version 4 that have facilitated the development of the three services I have developed, EmailReader, Telgo 323 and CANS...|$|E

Real time voice services will continue to be dominant in future cellular systems and to reduce system costs it is desirable to base all services, including <b>voice,</b> <b>on</b> <b>IP.</b> However, the radio spectrum must be efficiently used to provide mass-market services at reasonable prices, but Internet protocol headers are large in size. Moreover, data discarding policies are poorly suited to the error-proneness of cellular links. Protocol overhead for IP-based voice services can be reduced by compressing headers, e. g. with the compressed real time protocol (CRTP). CRTP, however, does not perform well over cellular links since it is not robust in the face of errors. ROCCO, a header compression scheme suitable for cellular systems, delivers more packets to the user than CRTP at realistic error rates with a better average compression ratio. Voice services in cellular systems should also be able to use damaged speech data. This can be done using the UDP Lite protocol which provides a more flexible checksumming policy that enables delivery of data possibly usable to the application. This paper shows that CRTP/UDP fails to deliver sufficient service quality at the error rates of a cost-efficient cellular system and that ROCCO combined with UDP Lite can provide an IP-based voice service over such cellular systems.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} three encoding strategies {{based on}} digital logic for steganography <b>on</b> <b>Voice</b> over <b>IP</b> (VoIP), which aim {{to enhance the}} embedding transparency. Differing from previous approaches, our strategies reduce the embedding distortion by improving the similarity between the cover and the covert message using digital logical transformations, instead of {{reducing the amount of}} the substitution bits. Therefore, by contrast, our strategies will improve the embedding transparency without sacrificing the embedding capacity. Of these three strategies, the first one adopts logical operations, the second one employs circular shifting operations, and the third one combines the operations of the first two. All of them are evaluated through comparing their prototype implementations with some existing methods in a prototypical covert communication system based on VoIP (called StegVoIP). The experimental results show that the proposed strategies can effectively enhance the embedding transparency while maintaining the maximum embedding capacity...|$|R

Quality of Service (QoS) routing, attempts to provide real time services with the required guarantees to achieve acceptable performance.

We investigate the Shortest-Widest routing algorithm and the Widest-Shortest routing algorithm that uses the hop-normalized metric to provide QoS for real time applications. We show that although both algorithms have superior performance compared with the conventional delay and hop based routing algorithms, the Widest-Shortest algorithm using a modified cost metric based on the hop-normalized metric is better able to route real time traffic away from congested links thus providing better performance to satisfy real time services requirements.

40|$|Research <b>on</b> <b>Voice</b> over <b>IP</b> (VoIP) in {{infrastructure}} wireless local area networks (WLANs) has shown that, {{because of the}} access mechanism, the access point severely limits the number of voice calls a WLAN can support. To address this problem we propose a new scheme based on the IEEE 802. 11 e quality of service (QoS) mechanism where a tradeoff between codec quality and priority is exploited to improve the number of calls that can be supported. In particular, we propose certain priority settings at the access point (AP) to encourage users {{to switch to a}} lower quality codec during periods of high contention and thus enable them to maintain the call. We develop a detailed analytical model to show the benefit of this scheme. Our analytical results are validated by extensive simulation and show that the voice capacity in the network can be significantly improved. Furthermore, by using the ITU-T E-model to assess the voice quality, we show that users with a lower quality codec can still maintain an acceptable level of quality using the proposed scheme...|$|R

Cultivars significantly affected several life history parameters of the spider mite.

The traditional PoC {{defined in the}} Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) specification is a centralized architecture. In this architecture, servers need to be deployed for the PoC service to work and be widely available, presenting a substantial cost to ISPs. Meanwhile, the problem of network congestion and one point failure existing in the centralized architecture may degrade system performance and cause the failure of an entire system. In addition, the traditional floor control based on the centralized architecture, also suffers from the drawbacks of using a centralized controller.

Non-intrusive methods, instead, are a measurement based on observing parameters that permit the individuation of voice signal quality. The possibility of having the telephony on Internet presents a lot of advantages, first of all it gives the capability of constructing a single network for transporting voice and data signals.
