5|$|Most {{of those}} who died (comprising 78% of the {{fugitive}} <b>victims)</b> <b>were</b> young men aged between 16 and 30. Married men accounted for 20% of the deaths while only 8 (6%) were women. Nine children younger than 16 years old died, whereas 94 <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> aged between 21 and 30. The overwhelming majority came from East Berlin and the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|The {{killing of}} civilians living in Voćin and two nearby smaller villages began on 13 December at noon. The White Eagles infantry, {{supported}} {{by at least}} one tank, moved through Voćin bombing Croat-owned houses and killing civilians. The killings and the destruction took twelve hours and claimed the lives of 43 civilians. The bodies of the <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> mutilated and left on display, presumably as a warning to others, outside Voćin itself, to flee or perish. All the <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> Croat civilians, except one 77-year-old Serb who had tried to protect his neighbours from the paramilitaries. Most of the <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> elderly, including twelve women aged 56–76 and eleven men aged 60–84.|$|E
5|$|There were 147 {{recorded}} lynchings in Oklahoma between 1885 and 1930. Until {{segregation in}} 1907, most <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> white cattle rustlers or highwaymen.

5|$|The Moors murders {{were carried}} out by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley between July 1963 and October 1965, in and around Manchester, England. The <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> five {{children}} aged between 10 and 17—Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans—at least four of whom were sexually assaulted. Two of the <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> discovered in graves dug on Saddleworth Moor; a third grave was discovered there in 1987, {{more than twenty years}} after Brady and Hindley's trial. The body of a fourth victim, Keith Bennett, is also suspected to be buried there, but despite repeated searches remains undiscovered.|$|E

50|$|The {{identifiable}} <b>victim</b> {{effect has}} <b>been</b> contested in academia.

5|$|Having {{escaped the}} {{buildings}} {{in a variety}} of ways (including through doors and out of windows), some students found themselves impeded by a river that adjoined the school. However, some were able to use rowing boats as a means of escape. Saari started fires at several other locations within the school buildings, and the fire in the exam room damaged some of the bodies so badly that they had to be identified from DNA and dental records. Nine of the <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> found in the exam room, and one in a nearby corridor. It was later ascertained that this student had fled the burning classroom and then died in the corridor. Eight of the <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> female students, one a male student, and one a male member of staff. All of the students killed were in their 20s, and the teacher was in his 50s. A 21-year-old woman was shot in the head but had two operations in the days after sustaining her injury, and was reported as being in a satisfactory condition. A further ten students were treated for minor injuries including sprains and cuts from broken glass. All the <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> classmates of Saari's. Saari was originally from Pohjois-Pohjanmaa, but lived in Kauhajoki where he was enrolled on his catering course at the college. It was later revealed that the male student was probably a close friend of Saari's. The pair had spent an evening out together in February 2008 when they were threatened with a starter pistol. A photo of them together had been circulating on the Internet, in which Saari jokingly points at his friend's head with his forefinger. The names of the other <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> withheld by police.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{released}} {{the results of}} a five-year-long study (the Highway Serial Killings Initiative) investigating the unsolved murders of prostitutes, hitchhikers, and stranded motorists. Over 500 female victims have been compiled in a database, most of whom were killed or discarded at truck stops, hotels, and roadsides. The FBI has speculated that many of these <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> murdered by long-haul truck drivers, some of whom may be serial killers. Investigators speculate that the easy access to potential victims, mobility, and lack of supervision enjoyed by long-haul truck drivers have contributed to this phenomenon. The head of the initiative, Michael Harrigan, says most of the victims lead high-risk lifestyles (e.g., prostitution) which left them particularly vulnerable. In 2004, the FBI began investigating a string of murders in which the <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> found along the Interstate 40 corridor in Oklahoma and several other states, which sparked the creation of the Highway Serial Killings Initiative.|$|E
5|$|James Bond {{is sent to}} {{investigate}} the murder of three British MI6 agents, {{all of whom have}} been killed within 24 hours.

He also establishes that Kananga also acts as Mr. Big, a ruthless and cunning gangster.|$|E
50|$|Ingestion: The <b>victim’s</b> mouth should <b>be</b> rinsed at first. The <b>victim</b> should <b>be</b> given {{charcoal}} as a slurry (240 ml water/30 g charcoal). This is {{only possible}} when the <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> conscious.|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the impact of gender, victim job performance, and victim employment status on individual juror and jury perceptions of sexual harassment. Gender, victim job performance, and <b>victim</b> employment <b>are</b> all extralegal factors that were found to influence individual jurors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of sexual harassment. The present study revealed individual female jurors {{were more likely than}} male jurors to find sexual harassment. Although gender did not have a significant effect in jury perceptions of sexual harassment, further analysis revealed females were more likely than males to change their decision on sexual harassment in a jury. Victim job performance and employment status were both found to influence jury perceptions of sexual harassment. When the <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> a good, average performer, or no information <b>was</b> provided on <b>victim</b> job performance, the individual jurors were more likely to find sexual harassment than cases where the <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> a poor performer. When the <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> a good or poor performer or no information <b>was</b> provided for <b>victim</b> job performance, the jury was more likely to find sexual harassment than cases where the <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> an average performer. Individual jurors were more likely to find sexual harassment when the <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> currently employed or no information was provided than when the <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> fired from the organization. Juries were more likely to perceive sexual harassment when no employment information was provided than when the <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> currently employed fired. These results have implications for the legal system...|$|R

5|$|Judicial {{authorities}} {{investigating the}} charges said the alleged <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> not being fully cooperative, whereas former members were {{suspicious of the}} Mexican legal system, arguing that it favored the church.

5|$|Reports {{of the six}} {{missing women}} and Sparks's brutal beating {{appeared}} prominently in newspapers and on television throughout Washington and Oregon. Fear spread among the population; hitchhiking by young women dropped sharply. While pressure mounted on law enforcement agencies, the paucity of physical evidence severely hampered them. Police could not provide reporters with the little information that was available for fear of compromising the investigation. Further similarities between the <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> noted: The disappearances all took place at night, usually near ongoing construction work, {{within a week of}} midterm or final exams; all of the <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> wearing slacks or blue jeans; and at most crime scenes, there were sightings of a man wearing a cast or a sling, and driving a brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.|$|E
5|$|The Jadovno camp site {{remained}} unexplored {{after the}} war due to {{the depth of the}} gorges where bodies were disposed of and {{the fact that some of}} these had been filled with concrete by Yugoslavia's Communist authorities.

5|$|The Voćin {{massacre}} was {{the killing}} of 43 civilians in Voćin, Croatia, by the Serbian White Eagles paramilitary unit on 13 December 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. The massacre was carried out after the unit was ordered to abandon the village before the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) recaptured the area in Operation Papuk-91. All the <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> local Croats, save one Serb, {{who had tried to}} protect his neighbours. Gunfire was the leading cause of death, though some of the <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> killed with axes or chainsaws, or were burned to death. The victims exhibited signs of torture and were left unburied. On the night of 13–14 December, the White Eagles dynamited a 550-year-old church in the village.|$|E
5|$|The same day, several non-Serb {{civilians were}} killed in Dalj.
