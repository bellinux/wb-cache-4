5|$|At the college, Morris met fellow first-year {{undergraduate}} Edward Burne-Jones, {{who became}} his lifelong friend and collaborator.

5|$|Captive whales have {{occasionally}} {{been known}} to mimic human speech. Scientists have suggested this indicates a strong desire {{on behalf of the}} whales to communicate with humans, as whales have a <b>very</b> <b>different</b> vocal mechanism, so imitating human speech likely takes considerable effort.|$|E

5|$|If the solvent {{is water}} {{in either the}} {{evaporation}} or precipitation method of formation, {{in many cases the}} ionic crystal formed also includes water of crystallization, so the product is known as a hydrate, and can have <b>very</b> <b>different</b> chemical properties.|$|E
40|$|We {{start by}} {{comparing}} the psychoanalytic experience as a private practice, and as an institutional practice. Than we considere {{the differences between the}} way a father, makes the link betwen public and private langage in two different cases. They are both teenagers that relate a homossexual symptom.

5|$|In {{algebraic}} geometry and theoretical physics, mirror symmetry {{is a relationship}} between geometric objects called Calabi–Yau manifolds.

5|$|The {{remains of}} a {{complete}} male C. dirus are sometimes easy to identify compared to other Canis specimens because the baculum (penis bone) of the dire wolf is <b>very</b> <b>different</b> from that of all other living canids.|$|E
5|$|After Meredith is {{promoted}} to a resident, her younger half-sister Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) begins working at Seattle Grace as an intern. Meredith initially rejects Lexie's attempts {{to form a}} relationship, but slowly softens towards her. The sisters are <b>very</b> <b>different</b> people with different childhoods. Lexie had an idealistic family life and often has difficulty understanding her much darker sister, {{who does not have}} the same positive associations with family as Lexie.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotic drug {{design is}} {{facilitated}} when an enzyme {{that is essential}} to the pathogen's survival is absent or <b>very</b> <b>different</b> in humans. In the example above, humans do not make peptidoglycan, therefore inhibitors of this process are selectively toxic to bacteria. Selective toxicity is also produced in antibiotics by exploiting differences {{in the structure of the}} ribosomes in bacteria, or how they make fatty acids.|$|E

5|$|At this point, {{there is}} a {{divergence}} in the classical sources as to the course of events which cannot be reconciled until the entry of Marcus Licinius Crassus into the war. The two most comprehensive (extant) histories of the war by Appian and Plutarch detail <b>very</b> <b>different</b> events. However, neither account directly contradicts the other, but simply reports different events, ignoring some events in the other account, and reporting events that are unique to that account.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{excellent}} thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. Boron nitride has potential use in nanotechnology.

5|$|Because of {{production}} difficulty and high price, lutetium has very few commercial uses, especially {{since it is}} rarer {{than most of the}} other lanthanides but is chemically not <b>very</b> <b>different.</b> However, stable lutetium can be used as catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and can also be used in alkylation, hydrogenation, and polymerization applications.|$|E
