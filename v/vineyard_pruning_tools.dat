40|$|ABSTRACT: The agri-energetic chain project, {{financed by}} the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, {{concerns}} the realization of a pilot plant for energy recovering of <b>vineyards</b> <b>pruning</b> residues near an important wine viticulture company in Umbria (Cantine G. Lungarotti). The chain is divided in the following phases: grapes pruning harvesting and storage by a round-baler; chipping cylindrical bales to obtain a biochips whose size {{is consistent with the}} biomass boiler; chemical-physical characterization of the biochips; biomass energy conversion in the diathermic oil boiler. Grapes pruning round-baling reached an average productivity of 0, 70 tons/ha dry basis. Chipping of cylindrical bales, because of the huge dimensions of bales not compatible with mouth opening width of a common chipper, has been realised by means of a special mixer wagon. Energetic conversion phase will be executed by a diathermic oil boiler with useful thermal power 400 kW. The innovative aspect is burning residual <b>vineyard</b> <b>pruning</b> in a boiler to heat diathermic oil up to + 300 °C; diathermic oil allows the energy production in four different shapes: hot water for rooms heating; cool water up to- 10 °C for vinification processes; cool water up to + 7 °C for summer conditioning of company rooms; steam production for bottles sterilization processes...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Lactic acid {{bacteria}} is {{an interesting}} group of microorganisms {{for the production of}} biosurfactants. In addition, these bacteria are generally recognized as safe by the American Food and Drug Administration. An example is the Lactobacil/us paracasei that was isolated from a Portuguese dairy industry and has been previously reported by Gudina and collaborators [1] forthe production of biosurfactants. The biosurfactants produced by LAB are cell-bound biosurfactants contrarily to the most well-known extracellular biosurfactants produced by Pseudomonas or Bacillus species. The main bottleneck of their industrial production and application is related with the production and recovery costs. Therefore, many studies are focusing on the use of renewable agroindustrial wastes as carbon sources in the fermentative processes [2]. The aim of this work was the production and characterization of biosurfactants by L. paracasei using a lignocellulosic residue (<b>vineyard</b> <b>pruning</b> waste) as carbon source. The <b>vineyard</b> <b>pruning</b> waste was subjected to a fractionation process to obtain cellulose, which was next submitted to a saccharification step with enzymes in order to convert cellulose in a glucose-based fermentation media. Once this glucose solution was obtained, it was further supplemented with 1 O g/L of yeast extract and 1 O g/L of corn steep liquor.

40|$|Comparative {{tests of}} 4 systems for {{harvesting}} <b>vineyard</b> <b>pruning</b> residues {{were carried out}} using 1) a square baler; 2) a round baler; 3) a comminuter (or shredder) with drop-down re-usable containers (big bags); 4) a comminuter with built-in dumping bin. All machines were light enough for towing or carrying behind compact vineyard tractors. The machines were tested in Central Italy, on 10 ha of hill vineyard, with slope gradients ranging from 20 to 35 %. The tests included forwarding the processed residue to a central storage place 3 km away. Harvesting-processing productivity ranged from 1. 1 to 1. 7 t per scheduled machine hour (SMH), including all delays. Calculated harvesting-processing costs varied between 19. 7 and 32. 3 € t- 1, but increased from 53. 0 and 105. 2 € t- 1 when forwarding the residues to a central collection point was included. The additional cost of residue management could amount to about 25 € t- 1 (50 € ha- 1 for 2 t ha- 1). The commercial viability of recovering <b>vineyard</b> <b>pruning</b> residue also depends on the eventual redistribution of the savings accrued on residue management.

40|$|In this study, {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} (LCA) is used to assess and compare the environmental and energy profiles of three potential bioenergy production chains using different available feedstocks in Southern European countries. Two wastes, <b>vineyard</b> <b>pruning</b> and eucalypt logging residues, and a wooden energy crop, poplar, were examined in detail. The comparative LCA study showed {{that the use of}} poplar biomass for bioenergy production has a greater impact than the use of <b>vineyard</b> <b>pruning</b> and logging residues. The contribution from the poplarcultivation- related activities considerably affected the results, as all the activities from field preparation to harvesting have been included within the system boundaries. In contrast, all the activities performed in the vineyard and forest prior to collection of the residues have not been computed in both scenarios since they have been allocated to the driving force of these stands: grapes and roundwood, respectively. The results support the idea that forest and agricultural waste would be an interesting and potential raw material for bioenergy purposes. However, further analysis should focus on these potential bioenergy sources, namely in terms of their availability and technical burning conditions, in order to meet energy requirements. Moreover, the environmental results were compared with others from literature corresponding to electricity production using alternative biomass sources and fossil fuels. In all the categories considered for comparison, environmental benefits were reported for the electricity production using a biomass source. However, these results must be carefully used since other issues e such as production costs, water availability and land use e should be considered. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

In order {{to investigate the}} type and extent of mechanical injury that pruning causes to tree cambium {{as well as the}} effects on the healing process, different types of shear were selected and used in an eight-year-old Quercus robur L. plantation. The amount of removed, detached and crushed bark was assessed by means of image analysis immediately after pruning. After 15 months, the effect of different cutting patterns on the healing process was investigated by measuring the area of the pruned branch covered by woundwood (HI 1). Five years after pruning, the same analysis was performed above and below bark (HIo 5 and HIu 5) and a number of parameters were assessed in order to quantify the quantity and quality (symmetry) of woundwood growth and the healing time for sealing. The action of <b>pruning</b> <b>tools</b> depends on cutting pattern and branch diameter. The greater the diameter, the longer the healing time.

40|$|Vineyards cover {{about eight}} {{millions}} of hectares worldwide and their annual pruning generates {{a large amount}} of ligno-cellulosic biomass, potentially available for industrial and energy use. Commercial pruning residue harvesters are now available, which may allow cost-effective recovery. The study aimed at determining the quantity and the quality of pruning residues potentially derived from vineyard management. Data were obtained from 17 fields in Northern and Central Italy. Fields were harvested with seven different machines. The experimental design adapted to the necessities of field trials, but was adequate for testing the main sources of variability. Net residue yield varies around 1 oven dry tonne per hectare, with minor differences between grape varietals and harvesting technologies. Losses are still high, and are generally related to ineffective management techniques. Moisture content at harvest varies between 40 % and 45 %, whereas the higher heating value is slightly lower than that of forest fuels. Comminuted vineyard residues are unsuitable for firing residential boilers, due to the frequent presence of oversize and/or undersize particles. The application of pesticides does not result in any significant contamination with noxious chemicals, because these products are almost completely weathered before residues are recovered.

40|$|The ambitious {{targets of}} the European Union in {{increasing}} the use of renewable energies to 20 % of Europe’s energy needs, call for urgent changes, including in the biomass sector. The share of solid biomass for heating purposes could be further increased by replacing oil- and gas-fired furnaces with biomass boilers and by expanding the spectrum of biomass raw materials for small-scale combustion systems. The interest in using non-woody biomass fuels for heat production has been increasing in Europe due to two main factors. First, the market for fossil fuels is unstable and their prices are continuously rising. Second, the increase competition for woody biomass between the heating sector and other industries, have increased the price of wood. As a result, the interest for alternative biomass fuels is growing rapidly, covering woody materials of low quality, energy crops and forest residues. The present work aims at investigating the technical feasibility of using non-woody biomass fuels in existing small-scale combustion appliances developed for burning wood. Therefore, combustion tests with different non-woody biomass fuels and in different combustion appliances were performed in standard laboratory conditions and in households under real life conditions (field tests). The laboratory tests were performed using eight different fuels (straw, Miscanthus, maize, <b>vineyard</b> <b>pruning,</b> hay, wheat bran and Sorghum) while in the field tests straw, Miscanthus and maize were burned. The gaseous and particle emissions, the slag tendency and {{the efficiency of the}} combustion systems operated with non-woody biomass fuels were analysed and when possible compared with the legal requirements defined in FPrEN 303 - 5. The limitations of the investigated combustion appliances when operated with non-woody biomass fuels were analysed and discussed. Non-woody biomass fuels could be used for heat production in existing combustion appliances as long as the systems are adapted for burning high ash content fuels. Among the investigated fuels, Miscanthus, <b>vineyard</b> <b>pruning</b> and hay could be burnt in most of the tested combustion appliances while fulfilling the legal European requirements (defined in FprEN 303 - 5) in terms of emissions and efficiency. The non-woody biomass fuels showed problems with ash accumulation and slag formation and could only be burned without unwanted shutdowns in combustion appliances adapted to manage high ash content fuels. Straw, wheat bran and maize were the most problematic fuels regarding slagging. The combustion appliances require appropriate technological developments to manage the strong variability in terms of chemical and thermal properties of the non-woody biomass fuels. The results of the laboratory tests were generally in agreement with the field test results.

The use of suppressive composts {{is a low}} environmental impact method for its control. Although {{attempts have been made}} to reveal the relationship between microbiota and compost suppressiveness, little is known about the microorganisms associated with disease suppression. Here, an Ion Torrent platform was used to assess the microbial composition of composts made of different agro-industrial waste and with different levels of suppressiveness against P. nicotianae. Both bacterial and fungal populations responded differently depending on the chemical heterogeneity of materials used during the composting process. High proportions (67 – 75 %) of <b>vineyard</b> <b>pruning</b> waste were used in the most suppressive composts, COM-A and COM-B. This material may have promoted the presence of higher relative abundance of Ascomycota as well as higher microbial activity, which have proved to be essential for controlling the disease.

The study was also extended to the soil, being potentially mixed to the biomass in the case of mechanical collection of pruning residues. The grapevine residues free of impurities that were collected during this study have typical values of copper in pruning wood, varying from 8. 5 mg kg – 1 when treated with low Cu product, to 19. 2 mg kg – 1 when treated with high Cu product. It was observed that contaminations during pruning with soil could increase the amount of copper in the residues. More in detail, every percentage point of soil that winds up on pruning residues involves an increase of 1 mg of Cu every kg of biomass. For this reason, we recommend the use of appropriate systems for the harvest of grapevine residues, particularly mechanical systems that avoid soil lifting. Moreover, we suggest the use of pruning residues preferably in large-scale power plants with appropriate emission filters instead of small-scale domestic boilers...|$|R
40|$|Understanding how grapevines {{perceive}} {{and adapt}} to different environments will {{provide us with}} an insight into how to better manage crop quality. Mounting evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms are a key interface between {{the environment and the}} genotype that ultimately affect the plant’s phenotype. Moreover, it is now widely accepted that epigenetic mechanisms are a source of useful variability during crop varietal selection that could affect crop performance. While the contribution of DNA methylation to plant performance has been extensively studied in other major crops, very little work has been done in grapevine. To study the genetic and epigenetic diversity across 22 vineyards planted with the cultivar Shiraz in six wine sub-regions of the Barossa, South Australia. Methylation sensitive amplified polymorphisms (MSAPs) were used to obtain global patterns of DNA methylation. The observed epigenetic profiles showed a high level of differentiation that grouped vineyards by their area of provenance despite the low genetic differentiation between vineyards and sub-regions. Pairwise epigenetic distances between vineyards indicate that the main contributor (23 – 24 %) to the detected variability is associated to the distribution of the vineyards on the N–S axis. Analysis of the methylation profiles of <b>vineyards</b> <b>pruned</b> with the same system increased the positive correlation observed between geographic distance and epigenetic distance suggesting that pruning system affects inter-vineyard epigenetic differentiation. Finally, methylation sensitive genotyping by sequencing identified 3, 598 differentially methylated genes in grapevine leaves that were assigned to 1, 144 unique gene ontology terms of which 8. 6 % were associated with response to environmental stimulus. Our results suggest that DNA methylation differences between vineyards and sub-regions within The Barossa are influenced both by the geographic location and, to a lesser extent, by pruning system. Finally, we discuss how epigenetic variability {{can be used as a}} tool to understand and potentially modulate terroir in grapevine...|$|R
