40|$|<b>Video</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> are {{a rapidly}} growing industry. As with most systems, this {{technology}} presents both opportunities and threats. The wide adoption of <b>video</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> by various businesses and individuals has raised some vital security issues. Appropriately addressing these security issues is of great importance for <b>video</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems,</b> as these systems may capture sensitive personal data and may attract numerous attacks. As of today nearly all devices have become networked (or {{are on their way}} to being connected to networks), hence eavesdropping is a common attack which can exploit a breach of a system’s security and result in data disclosure to unauthorised parties, video stream alterations, interference, and reduction of a system’s performance. Moreover, it is important that <b>video</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> are standardized by appropriate standardization organizations in order to assure high quality of the security services that utilize these systems and to facilitate interoperability.

40|$|Abstract- Most of the {{notification}} {{mechanisms of}} current intelligent <b>video</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> {{are based on}} traditional methods, which either require operators on duty to receive and deal with early-warning notification from <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems,</b> or notice related personnel by broadcasting. The former costs {{a great deal of}} labor and effort, and the latter is inconvenient. Moreover, some other intelligent <b>video</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> could even only provide clues for ex post analysis, whose instantaneity performance is poor. To solve these problems of notification mechanisms in current intelligent <b>video</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems,</b> a security early warning system based on mobile push technology which uses XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is proposed in this paper. The performance test results indicate that the proposed system not only improves the instantaneity performance, but also saves labor and effort...|$|R
