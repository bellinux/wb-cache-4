50|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, Duke Williams {{gave the}} Castle to his illegitimate son in 1405. His son did not hold the Castle for long, as he sold it to Johan Van Broeckhuysen, lord of the Waardenburg, in 1424. The Castle only changed hands by {{marriage}} for the next 400 years. In 1496, Johan Van Broeckhuysen married Otto <b>Van</b> <b>Arkel,</b> which ended up giving the <b>Van</b> <b>Arkel</b> family control of the Castle for centuries. The <b>Van</b> <b>Arkel</b> family was a well-known and quite wealthy family in the region {{at the time of the}} wedding. At {{the end of the}}ir rule, the <b>Van</b> <b>Arkel’s</b> had controlled the Castle for five generations.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the time}} the French {{soldiers}} arrived at the Castle in 1672, the <b>Van</b> <b>Arkel’s</b> were able to regain some of their prior wealth. As the French made {{their way through the}} Dutch countryside, they destroyed numerous Castles. The French soldiers also threatened to destroy the Ammersoyen Castle, but Thomas <b>Van</b> <b>Arkel</b> was able to buy the Castles safety from the French by offering the French commanding officer 7000 guilders. While this ensured the Castles safety, it left the <b>Van</b> <b>Arkel’s</b> in a severe amount of debt. This debt meant that the final interior redecorating under the <b>Van</b> <b>Arkel's</b> could not be completed [...] In 1693, following the death of the last <b>Van</b> <b>Arkel's,</b> Thomas, the Castle came into the hands of a number of other Dutch families over the next century. The owners of the Castle during this period were often very rich families who had various estates throughout the region and spent little time at the Castle.|$|R

40|$|Thorium samples, the {{surfaces}} of which were mechanically polished, electropolished and as grown from the <b>van</b> <b>Arkel</b> process, were systematically studied by optical reflectivity measurements. These optical data were compared with published measurements showing significant discrepancies. Increasing surface roughness was found to lower the reflectivity considerably and probably to induce surface plasmons indicated by a deep minimum in reflectivity at 4 eV. Best reflectivity data were obtained only for electropolished surfaces. Well chosen conditions for the <b>van</b> <b>Arkel</b> process give also good results...|$|R

50|$|The crystal bar process (also {{known as}} iodide process or the <b>van</b> <b>Arkel</b> - de Boer process) was {{developed}} by Anton Eduard <b>van</b> <b>Arkel</b> and Jan Hendrik de Boer in 1925. This process was the first industrial process for the commercial production of pure ductile metallic zirconium. It {{is used in the}} production of small quantities of ultra-pure titanium and zirconium. It primarily involves the formation of the metal iodides and their subsequent decomposition to yield pure metal. This process was superseded commercially by the Kroll process.|$|R
50|$|Once the <b>Van</b> <b>Arkel’s</b> regained enough {{wealth to}} rebuild the Castle the {{original}} architecture had become obsolete. As a result, the family made severe changes to the original layout of the Castle. They restored the outside to essentially the same design as the original, but changed they inside considerably. Given how much architectural styles had changed since the Castle was founded, is very surprising that the then Lord, Thomas Walraven <b>Van</b> <b>Arkel,</b> chose to restore the outside with traditional medieval style. Given the changes in architectural styles, {{the interior of the}} Castle was transformed to a much more comfortable living space. The original Castle had traditional, large rooms with high ceilings. Among these large rooms was the large knights hall. These sorts of rooms were very common in medieval Castles. When the <b>Van</b> <b>Arkel’s</b> repaired the Castle they got rid of the grand hall, elected to have numerous, smaller rooms instead.|$|R
50|$|His {{most prestigious}} design was the Astoria {{building}} (1904-1905), a Jugendstil office building at Keizersgracht 174-176 in Amsterdam, built as {{the headquarters of}} the Eerste Hollandsche Levensverzekerings Bank insurance company. With six floors and a maximum height of 37 metres, the Astoria building {{was one of the first}} office towers in the Netherlands. Baanders designed this building together with Gerrit <b>van</b> <b>Arkel.</b> In 2001 it gained rijksmonument (national monument) status. Another design by Baanders and <b>Van</b> <b>Arkel,</b> a double house at Korte Marnixkade 4 (1893), has rijksmonument status as well.|$|R
5000|$|According {{to popular}} legend a [...] "Jan van Arkel" [...] {{was the first}} to have settled the village of Acquoy, when he {{returned}} from the crusades in 1133. However, this is highly unlikely, because there were no crusades in the period around 1133. The first crusade was from 1096-99 and the second one was from 1147-49. Some sources report that the Jan <b>van</b> <b>Arkel</b> mentioned was in fact Jan I <b>van</b> <b>Arkel.</b> However, he lived a century later and had the nickname [...] "de Sterke", which means [...] "the strong".|$|R

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the programme Biological Research Ems-Dollard Estuary (BOEDE) inventories were made of the Ems-Dollard estuary during the period 1974 – 1979. Samples were collected in both intertidal and more deeper subtidal and gully areas. Sampling in the intertidal was done during both low and high tider. Low tide sampling followed the procedure of the Balgzand sampling: cores were taken up to 30 cm depth and sieved in the field over a 1 mm sieve. High tide sampling was done with a specially designed flushing sampler (<b>Van</b> <b>Arkel</b> & Mulder, 1975; Neth. J. Sea Res. 9, 365 - 370.; Mulder & <b>Van</b> <b>Arkel,</b> 1980; Neth. J. Sea Res. 14, 119 - 122.). Sampling of subtidal and gully was done from a research vessel with a standard Van Veen grab-sampler. The first inventory took place in 1974 - 1975 and it was repeated in 1978 and 1979. Information has been published in <b>Van</b> <b>Arkel</b> & Mulder (1979, 1982), Anon (1983) and Baretta & Ruardy (1988).
