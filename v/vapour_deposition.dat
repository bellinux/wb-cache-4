25|$|Supercritical fluids {{can be used}} {{to deposit}} {{functional}} nanostructured films and nanometer-size particles of metals onto surfaces. The high diffusivities and concentrations of precursor in the fluid as compared to the vacuum systems used in chemical <b>vapour</b> <b>deposition</b> allow deposition to occur in a surface reaction rate limited regime, providing stable and uniform interfacial growth. This is crucial in developing more powerful electronic components, and metal particles deposited in this way are also powerful catalysts for chemical synthesis and electrochemical reactions. Additionally, due to the high rates of precursor transport in solution, it is possible to coat high surface area particles which under chemical <b>vapour</b> <b>deposition</b> would exhibit depletion near the outlet of the system and also be likely to result in unstable interfacial growth features such as dendrites. The result is very thin and uniform films deposited at rates much faster than atomic layer deposition, the best other tool for particle coating at this size scale.|$|E
25|$|Some {{grades of}} {{titanium}} based pigments {{as used in}} sparkly paints, plastics, finishes and pearlescent cosmetics are man-made pigments whose particles have two or more layers of various oxides – often titanium dioxide, iron oxide or alumina – {{in order to have}} glittering, iridescent and or pearlescent effects similar to crushed mica or guanine-based products. In addition to these effects a limited colour change is possible in certain formulations depending on how and at which angle the finished product is illuminated and the thickness of the oxide layer in the pigment particle; one or more colours appear by reflection while the other tones appear due to interference of the transparent titanium dioxide layers. In some products, the layer of titanium dioxide is grown in conjunction with iron oxide by calcination of titanium salts (sulfates, chlorates) around 800°C or other industrial deposition methods such as chemical <b>vapour</b> <b>deposition</b> on substrates such as mica platelets or even silicon dioxide crystal platelets of no more than 50µm in diameter.|$|E

In this work, plasma-enhanced-chemical <b>vapour</b> <b>depositions</b> (PE-CVD) from acrylic acid and allylamine vapours have been performed to deposit coatings bearing oxygen (0) - and nitrogen (N) -containing functional groups on polyethylenethereplualate (PET) surface. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y cells were grown on plasma modified substrates and in presence of media containing different amount of fetal calf serum (FCS) or in serum-free medium containing cAMP. Our results showed that N-containing substrates improved cell adhesion, while the neurites sprouting was influenced by cell culture media.

25|$|Metals {{can also}} be an {{effective}} way to confine light in structures equal to or smaller than the optical wavelength. This effect is emergent from the confined surface plasmon resonance induced by the resonating light, which, when confined to the surface of a nanostructure such as a gold channel or nanorod, induces electromagnetic resonance. Surface plasmon effects are strong in the visible range because the permittivity of a metal is very large and negative at visible frequencies. At frequencies higher than the visible range, the permittivity of a metal is closer to zero, and the metal stops being useful for focussing electric and magnetic fields. This effect was originally observed in radio and microwave engineering, where metal antennas and waveguides may be hundreds of times smaller than the free-space wavelength. In the same way, visible light can be constricted to the nano level with metal structures which form channels, tips, gaps, etc. Gold is also a convenient choice for nanofabrication because of its unreactivity and ease of use with chemical <b>vapour</b> <b>deposition.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Chemical <b>Vapour</b> <b>Deposition</b> (CVD). This {{was a major}} {{development}} area at Fulmer. A wide range of metals and inorganic compounds were deposited. [...] Examples are: tungsten coating of graphite rocket nozzles for ablation resistance, boron nitride crucibles for melting gallium arsenide, alumina coatings on carbon fibres for reinforcement of aluminium, zinc sulphide infra-red radomes for heat-seeking missiles. Fulmer's profound understanding of subhalide disproportionation led its chemists to devise {{a process in which}} halide vapour, pulsed at low partial pressure could be used to put uniform oxidation resistant coatings of aluminium or chromium on gas turbine blades. This was especially difficult because the coated surface had to include the insides of the blades' long narrow cooling passages – [...] 2mm diameter and 180mm long for example. In 1975 Fulmer hosted the fifth International Conference on Chemical Vapor Deposition.|$|E
40|$|In an {{important}} initiative to reduce carbon dioxide emission from pulverized fuel boilers, coal is now co-fired with biomass. During the combustion process, however, chlorine and sulphur in chemical compounds associated with sodium and potassium are released {{in a form}} which can deposit onto and then corrode the steel heat exchanger tubes. The deposition and corrosion can have serious implications for the power generation industry because the corrosive damage on heat exchange tubes can shorten the operational life of the boilers and lead to significant economic penalties. The deposition and corrosion processes have been widely studied but eliminating the deposits and corrosive materials is still a challenging problem. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) {{has been used to}} model the deposition processes and it mainly focuses on experimentally deriving constants in the models that capture some aspects of the problem such as the motion behaviour of aerosols. However, using CFD has a limitation that results in periodic instability when solving the models with numerical computation. Modelling deposition environments around superheater tubes is a complex problem as many aspects, such as particle motion, condensation of matter and continuous combustion of particles, should be considered. This thesis has: (1) developed a new mathematical approach that uses mesh-free methods to solve Hamilton’s equations with a consideration of the total energy of the system, where the Hamilton’s equation is scale independent; (2) developed a model that can simulate the mass accumulation process based on graph and combinatorics theory; (3) developed a model depicting the continuous combustion of particles in motion; (4) developed a model depicting the behaviour of changing matter states; (5) developed a model depicting the <b>vapour</b> phase <b>deposition</b> on particles; and (6) verified the developed models with case studies. This work shows the importance of homogenous and heterogeneous <b>vapour</b> <b>depositions</b> on binding particles onto superheater tubes...|$|R
40|$|Machine {{contamination}} poses {{serious problems}} {{to the food}} processing industry particularly from an economic and hygienic perspective. Various studies therefore investigated the impact of energy-related and topography-related surface properties on the contamination tendency and the cleanability of material probes. These tests were carried out with stainless steel as reference as well as 46 surface modifications taken from the area of polymer coatings, nanocomposite coatings and physical/chemical <b>vapour</b> <b>depositions</b> (PVD/CVD) on the basis or whey protein and starch contamination. The findings showed that starch deposits on modified surface specimens were reduced by up to 76 % (Fluorinated ethylene propylene, FEP) in contrast to stainless steel. Whey protein deposits were reduced by up to 34 % (nanocomposite). The remaining starch contamination after one spray cleaning was reduced by up to 50 % (FEP) and the whey protein contamination was reduced by up to 88 % (FEP). Comparing the roughness and surface energy with the contamination and cleaning behaviour yields no clear correlation. But depending {{on the kind of}} contamination there is the tendency that low energetic surfaces show a better cleanability or less deposits. Furthermore, the surface modifications tested showed different abrasion resistance and different levels of resistance to repeated stress with detergents...|$|R

2500|$|Nanocellulose {{can also}} be used to make aerogels/foams, either {{homogeneously}} or in composite formulations. Nanocellulose-based foams are being studied for packaging applications in order to replace polystyrene-based foams. Svagan et al. showed that nanocellulose has the ability to reinforce starch foams by using a freeze-drying technique. The advantage of using nanocellulose instead of wood-based pulp fibers is that the nanofibrills can reinforce the thin cells in the starch foam. Moreover, it is possible to prepare pure nanocellulose aerogels applying various freeze-drying and super critical [...] drying techniques. Aerogels and foams can be used as porous templates. Tough ultra-high porosity foams prepared from cellulose I nanofibrill suspensions were studied by Sehaqui et al. a wide range of mechanical properties including compression was obtained by controlling density and nanofibrill interaction in the foams. Cellulose nanowhiskers could also be made to gel in water under low power sonication giving rise to aerogels with the highest reported surface area (>600m2/g) and lowest shrinkage during drying (6.5%) of cellulose aerogels. In another study by Aulin et al., the formation of structured porous aerogels of nanocellulose by freeze-drying was demonstrated. The density and surface texture of the aerogels was tuned by selecting the concentration of the nanocellulose dispersions before freeze-drying. Chemical <b>vapour</b> <b>deposition</b> of a fluorinated silane was used to uniformly coat the aerogel to tune their wetting properties towards non-polar liquids/oils. The authors demonstrated that it is possible to switch the wettability behaviour of the cellulose surfaces between super-wetting and super-repellent, using different scales of roughness and porosity created by the freeze-drying technique and change of concentration of the nanocellulose dispersion. Structured porous cellulose foams can however also be obtained by utilizing the freeze-drying technique on cellulose generated by Gluconobacter strains of bacteria, which bio-synthesize open porous networks of cellulose fibers with relatively large amounts of nanofibrills dispersed inside. Olsson et al. demonstrated that these networks can be further impregnated with metalhydroxide/oxide precursors, which can readily be transformed into grafted magnetic nanoparticles along the cellulose nanofibers. The magnetic cellulose foam may allow for a number of novel applications of nanocellulose and the first remotely actuated magnetic super sponges absorbing 1gram of water within a 60mg cellulose aerogel foam were reported. Notably, these highly porous foams (>98% air) can be compressed into strong magnetic nanopapers, which may find use as functional membranes in various applications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{discovered in}} 1991 and after their developed in various fields, the first theory of boron nitride nanotubes predicted in 1994 and experimentally synthesized by arc-discharge method in 1995. In recent years, most works {{focused on the}} synthesis of boron nitride nanotubes. Boron nitride nanotubes have a structure {{similar to that of}} carbon nanotubes, whereas carbon nanotubes can be metallic or semiconducting depending on the rolling direction and radius, boron nitride nanotubes are an electrical insulator with a wide band gap of ~ 5. 5 eV (same as in diamond), which is independent of tube chirality and morphology. In this paper, similarities and differences between structural parameters and properties of boron nitride nanotubes with carbon nanotubes are particularly compared and are expected to be as desirable for application as carbon nanotubes. All these properties develop the solid basis for their future technological applications. [5] All well-founded techniques of CNTs growth, such as arc-discharge [6, 7], laser ablation [8, 9], and chemical <b>vapour</b> <b>depositions</b> [10] are used to synthesize BNNTs. BNNTs can be produced by ball milling of amorphous boron, mixed with a catalyst: iron powder, under NH 3 atmosphere.

40|$|Organic {{polymeric}} {{solar cells}} require thin absorber layers due to intrinsic low exciton diffusion distances, thus showing low absorption of light. They are also characterized {{by having a}} low absorption peak, whose position lies in the near-infrared, slightly affecting the visible spectrum. By depositing thin silver layers of 10 nm for the back electrode, a semi-transparent organic solar cell can be created. Attractive outcomes could result from these devices, like solar cell windows that would remain visually transparent, while still collecting energy from the sun, or tandem polymeric solar cells. The formation of a non-homogeneous and discontinuous silver layer when depositing an ultra-thin film turns into a high resistivity electrode, therefore limiting the area that such devices can reach and the maximum power that the cell can offer. The goal of this bachelor thesis was to up-scale semi-transparent organic solar cells by characterizing the thin electrode conductivity and enhancing its charge collection using thick grid-like layers of silver. The cause for such high resistivity was confirmed by finding silver agglomerations of 30 nm in size, and a lower limit for its value was found by studying the silver bulk resistivity. The upscaling losses were determined {{in terms of the}} increase in area, and charge-collecting grids were consequently tested.

30|$|The above {{arguments}} can {{be supported}} by previous research [65]. For the first time, their team had reported the life cycle assessment (LCA) on ecotoxicity of PSC. Fabrication is based on two most successive reported articles on fabricating PSC that is <b>Vapour</b> Phase <b>Deposition</b> and Solution Processing. They concluded that the major contributor to negative environmental effect comes from the manufacturing process itself. The electricity required to fabricate the cell is the main arguments for this paper, and this by all means covers <b>vapour</b> and solution <b>deposition.</b> The only difference is the percentage of contribution between these two processing methods. Additionally, the life cycle impact analysis revealed that in both deposition processes, the impact was focused primarily on the human toxicity (cancer effect) and freshwater ecotoxicity, {{which is due to}} lead emission [65, 66]. However, the article suggested that PSC technology does not pose concern in its raw materials extraction, synthesis of the starting materials and manufacture of the PSC as compared to the other solar cell technologies. In another LCA, the research focuses on the difference of TiO 2 module and ZnO module for PSC [67]. The study found that both PSC modules have the shortest energy payback time compared to the other solar cell technologies while emphasizing on reducing the high energy demand processes to lower the CO 2 emission factor.|$|R
