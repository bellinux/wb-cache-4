40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{computer model}} of a shopping center was navigated by participants who were unfamiliar with it. In the first experiment, an orthogonal and equally spaced grid was used. It {{was found that the}} great majority of the itineraries made simple and similar patterns which were remembered by the participants, although they often mistook the precise path choices. In a second experiment, the width of the corridors was varied. Participants showed a distinct preference for wider corridors over narrow ones, resulting in a significantly different distribution of itineraries when compared with the results of the first experiment. Dimensional variation did not improve the ability of the participants to remember their itineraries, however. Also, individuals preferred to continue moving straight-ahead over turning. They also preferred to circumnavigate the shopping center, traveling along the outer edges, rather than head first into its center. The computer-based model is a low-cost way of testing preference in a dynamic way and could be mounted on multiple stations in computer laboratories as a way of increasing sample size. There remain some interface problems, however, that diminish somewhat the sensation of moving in real time. Further work will include refinements to the model and other variations in geometry and visual stimuli in the <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>center,</b> in addition to its validation in real environments...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Shopping</b> <b>centers</b> are an {{important}} aspect of the extremely dynamic life of the 21 st century consumer. Nowadays, worldwide, <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> represent significant investments, remarking themselves with bold architectures and structures and an individual brand image. Retail markets are currently under transformation by a confluence of new retailing technologies, dramatic shifts in the demographic profile and preferences of more affluent and educated shoppers. Still in process of recovering from the devastating recession, retailers and landlords are facing a new set of challenges as Internet technology is transforming both consumer behavior and retailing business models. E-commerce 2 is upending traditional retailing strategies by greatly expanding shopping convenience, selection and affordability. Computers and mobile devices will mix the <b>virtual</b> and real <b>shopping</b> experiences and will affect how <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> are planned and managed, better accommodating the needs of individual shoppers to an “E”-model...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to empirically measure the {{consumer}} utility tradeoff between store location (i. e., distance to a <b>shopping</b> <b>center)</b> and retail agglomeration in regional <b>shopping</b> <b>centers.</b> Using the Lakshmanan and Hansen retail expenditure model, our findings reveal that the distance specification is of surprisingly little importance in explaining retail sales. Conversely, agglomeration economies were of significant importance in explaining consumer patronage at regional <b>shopping</b> <b>centers.</b> The implication of these results is that smaller regional <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> may be dominated by large super-regional <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> with the smaller one or two anchor regional <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> unable to compete with the larger, many-anchored super-regional <b>shopping</b> <b>centers.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to study how <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> in Stavanger region coexist with the city, with special focus on the {{relationship}} between the <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> and the neighborhoods. In addition, the sustainability aspect is examined to this research in order to provide more comprehensive study. The problem statement relies on understanding how the integrated <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> relate to some aspects such as location, density, accessibility, sustainable transport, and to some extent, economy. In order to comply with these objectives, the development of <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> in Stavanger region with their classification is generally discussed, and then some specific <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> were selected based on their distinct aspects mentioned above. The discoveries show that the location and the existing neighborhood’s condition influence the relation between the <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> and the neighborhoods.
