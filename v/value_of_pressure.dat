40|$|Abstract. Herschel-Bulkley {{model is}} used to {{describe}} the constitutive behavior of Magnetorheological(MR) fluids subject to an applied magnetic field. Based on the shear flow equation at the narrow gap, a theoretical analysis of the effect of the applied magnetic field on the viscoplastic flow between two parallel disks is presented. The expression for the velocity in viscoplastic flow is derived. The results indicate that the velocity profile of MR fluid in shear region is deeply dependent on the gradient of the pressure in the flow channel. For the negative pressure gradient value, the velocity peak value point tends to move toward the driven disc wall as absolute <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient increases. However, the velocity peak value point tends to move toward the driving disc wall as absolute <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient increases for the positive pressure gradient value...|$|E

Upon proper scaling and by means of an exact similarity transformation, the nonlinear momentum and constitutive equations of each layer transform into the respective system of highly nonlinear and coupled ordinary differential equations. Numerical solutions to the resulting boundary value problem are obtained using an efficient shooting technique in conjunction with a variable stepping method for different <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> gradients. It is observed that, unlike the Newtonian flows, in order to maintain a potential flow, normal stresses must inevitably develop.
