5|$|Josephine, at 62, {{felt she}} {{was too old to}} travel to India, but two American {{supporters}} <b>visited</b> <b>on</b> her behalf and spent four months building a dossier showing that the lock hospitals, compulsory examination and use of underage prostitutes—some as young as 11—were all continuing to operate. The campaign in Britain pushed again for changes, and Josephine spoke at meetings, published pamphlets and wrote to missionaries in India.|$|E
5|$|The Chinnery {{family was}} {{prominent}} enough {{that members of}} the English nobility visited often during the 1790s and early 19th century. King George III <b>visited</b> <b>on</b> occasion, and the Prince Regent, who later became George IV, was a regular visitor. George III's seventh son, Prince Adolphus, became a family friend, lived at Gilwell for a while, and tutored their eldest son George.|$|E
5|$|Everglades National Park is a U.S. National Park in Florida {{that protects}} the {{southern}} 20percent of the original Everglades.

5|$|In November 2014, the ACT Government {{announced}} the Night Noodle Markets {{would be coming}} to Canberra during the Enlighten Festival in 2015. The Night Noodle Markets feature Asian-themed street-food vendors. ACT Tourism Minister Andrew Barr told media that Canberra's Night Noodle Markets were expected to host up to 25 hawker style food stalls, and that the ACT Government had committed $200,000 to bring the 2015 noodle markets to the city. Around 156,000 peoples visited the inaugural Enlighten Night Noodle Markets—of whom 24,000 <b>visited</b> <b>on</b> the opening night, far exceeding expectations.|$|E
5|$|In {{between his}} various duties and responsibilities, Nansen had {{continued}} to take skiing holidays when he could. In February 1930, aged 68, he took a short break in the mountains with two old friends, who noted that Nansen was slower than usual and appeared to tire easily. On his return to Oslo he was laid up for several months, with influenza and later phlebitis, and was <b>visited</b> <b>on</b> his sickbed by King Haakon VII.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the film}} {{was shot in the}} cities of London, Paris, Venice, Palmdale, California, Port St. Lucie, Florida, and Rio de Janeiro. The {{production}} team had considered India and Nepal as a location in the film but on arriving at those places to investigate, they found that it was inconceivable to write them into the script, particularly with time restrictions to do so. They decided on Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, relatively early on, a city that Cubby Broccoli had <b>visited</b> <b>on</b> holiday, and a team was sent to that city in early 1978 to capture initial footage from the Carnival festival, which featured in the film.|$|E

5|$|Some Neolithic flint tools {{recovered}} {{from the top of}} the Tor show that the site has been visited, perhaps with lasting occupation, since prehistory. The nearby remains of Glastonbury Lake Village were identified at the site in 1892, which confirmed that there was an Iron Age settlement in about 300–200BC on what was an easily defended island in the fens. There is no evidence of permanent occupation of the Tor, but finds, including Roman pottery, do suggest that it was <b>visited</b> <b>on</b> a regular basis.|$|E

5|$|After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry {{and raising}} vast armies united by {{ethnicity}} and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually {{to the establishment}} of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206. The sultanate was to control much of North India, and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs. By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation <b>visited</b> <b>on</b> West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north. The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India {{paved the way for the}} indigenous Vijayanagara Empire. Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India, and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.|$|E
5|$|As a {{marriage}} gift, the Tsar gave George {{a group of}} islands in the Petalioi Gulf, which the family <b>visited</b> <b>on</b> the royal yacht Amphitrite. George later purchased a country estate, Tatoi, north of Athens, and on Corfu he built a summer villa called Mon Repos. George developed Tatoi, building roads and planting grapes for making his own wine, Chateau Décélie. Intent on not letting his subjects know that he missed Denmark, he discreetly maintained a dairy at his palace at Tatoi, which was managed by native Danes {{and served as a}} bucolic reminder of his homeland. Queen Olga was far less careful in hiding her nostalgia for her native Russia, often visiting Russian ships at Piraeus two or three times before they weighed anchor. When alone with his wife, George usually conversed in German. Their children were taught English by their nannies, and when talking with his children he therefore spoke mainly English.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1650s, Parchevich {{had entered}} major European {{politics}} {{and was the}} central figure of a significant anti-Ottoman plot. In 1656, Parchevich arranged a meeting in Târgovişte between {{the members of the}} plot, which included the rulers of Moldavia and Wallachia and high-ranking clerics, including the Serbian Patriarch. After the meeting, Parchevich sent revolutionary messages to Bulgaria, Serbia, Albania and Greece, hoping to incite a rebellion. His plans were backed by the rulers of the Romanian lands which border Bulgaria north of the Danube: Gheorghe Ştefan of Moldavia and Constantin Şerban of Wallachia. However, the lack of clear support by key accomplice Austria meant an eventual uprising had to be delayed. In 1657, Parchevich was received by Cossack hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, whom he <b>visited</b> <b>on</b> a special mission. In the same year, he was granted the noble title of baron by the Habsburgs owing to his merits in defending Christianity. As an Austrian noble, he was styled Peter Freiherr von Parchevich.|$|E

5|$|The Canadiens' team doctor, Dr. J.A. Hector Forgues, visited Morenz in late February and {{determined}} that he had suffered a nervous breakdown. To help Morenz, Dr. Forgues banned all visitors to his room, except for family and Canadiens officials. Mary, Morenz's wife, and their oldest son, Howie Jr., <b>visited</b> <b>on</b> most days, and William Morenz, his father, travelled from Stratford {{during the first week}} of March and stayed through March 5. On March 8, Morenz began complaining of chest pains, which doctors attributed to a heart attack. Mary Morenz and Cecil Hart were called to the hospital; around 11:30pm, Morenz tried to get out of bed to use the washroom but collapsed on the floor and died from a coronary embolism caused by blood clots from his damaged leg, minutes before his wife and coach arrived. He was 34.|$|E
5|$|The Mounties {{convince}} Kripik {{to come to}} {{the post}} to answer questions, and Kripik agrees. Several months pass. Hunt and Balk give Kripik the freedom of the post, and Hunt learns about the horrors the white traders <b>visited</b> <b>on</b> the Eskimo. When the Eskimo village moves on to new hunting rounds, Kripik's family stays behind to wait for him. They begin to starve, and Kripik learns of their plight. However, the rigid and rule-bound Inspector White has arrived at the RCMP outpost, and he demands that Kripik not only no longer be allowed to hunt during the day but also be chained down in his bed at night. Hunt tries to dissuade White, but White insists — and Hunt is forced to break his word that Kripik will not be chained.|$|E
5|$|With the {{accession}} of ElizabethI in November 1558, Robert Dudley {{came into}} great favour and was made Master of the Horse. Ambrose Dudley received {{the post of}} Master of the Ordnance, though he pressed his influential brother to delay the appointment somewhat, {{so that he could}} not be held accountable for his predecessor's embezzlement of funds. When their attainder had been lifted in 1558, the Dudley brothers had renounced any rights to their father's possessions or titles. Yet on 25 and 26December 1561 Ambrose Dudley was created Baron Lisle and Earl of Warwick, and the next year received {{a large portion of the}} lands confiscated from the Duke of Northumberland. Warwick Castlewhich the Queen <b>visited</b> <b>on</b> her 1572 summer progressbecame his seat, while the neighbouring Kenilworth Castle became that of Robert Dudley. Like their father, Ambrose and Robert Dudley adopted the bear and ragged staff, the heraldic device of the medieval Earls of Warwick.|$|E

5|$|Leftist {{influence}} in Syria grew {{further in the}} immediate wake of the crisis; on 15 August, a high-ranking officer from Sidon, Lebanon with Marxist leanings, Afif Bizri, was appointed army chief of staff, and several mid-level officers were replaced with communist officers. Quwatli flew to Egypt amid apparent plans to resign from the presidency {{in favor of the}} Soviet-leaning Azm. However, he returned to Syria on 26 August. Tensions had been rising as rumors swept the region regarding a US-backed Turkish or joint Iraqi-Jordanian invasion of Syria to prevent a potential communist takeover. Quwatli's earlier success in repairing ties between Syria and Saudi Arabia proved particularly useful during this period. Saud immediately lent his full support to Quwatli, whom he viewed as a significant counterweight to the leftist movement, by rebuffing President Dwight D. Eisenhower's appeal to endorse the Eisenhower Doctrine, a policy aimed at containing communist and Arab nationalist {{influence in}} the Middle East. He also accepted an invitation to Damascus by Quwatli on 25 August, publicly stating that Saudi Arabia would support Syria in any aggression against it. Iraqi Prime Minister Ali Jawdat also proclaimed support for Syria when he <b>visited</b> <b>on</b> 26 August, in spite of support for an attack by the Iraqi monarchy. Both Saud and Jawdat privately criticized Syria's leadership for increasing dependence on the Eastern bloc.|$|E
