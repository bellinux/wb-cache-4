500|$|Several months later, the Catholic League {{contacted}} Fox again, {{asking that}} the word [...] "Catholic" [...] be excised from the <b>voice-over</b> <b>when</b> the episode repeated in September1999 on the network, {{as well as in}} its subsequent syndicated airings. The network agreed, and Roland MacFarland, Fox's vice president of broadcast standards, ordered Scully to cut the word from the episode or eliminate all reference to religion. Scully refused, and after a long argument, MacFarland offered to replace the protesting denomination with a Protestant substitute – Methodist, Presbyterians or Baptists. Scully then asked MacFarland [...] "What would be the difference changing it to another religion, and wouldn't that just be offending a different group of people?", to which MacFarland replied that Fox had already had trouble with the Catholics earlier that season.|$|E

5000|$|A large orange tabby tomcat, he is [...] "the world's most finicky cat", eating only 9Lives, {{and making}} this {{preference}} clear with humorously sardonic <b>voice-over</b> comments <b>when</b> offered other brands. Every can of 9Lives features Morris's [...] "signature".|$|R
50|$|Murray and Thompson were {{concerned}} with the film's lack of continuity and in early 1980 added <b>voice-over</b> narration. <b>When</b> the film was sneak-previewed in late March, the last two scenes and narration were absent.

5000|$|Born in Chicago, Illinois, Crispin Freeman is {{the oldest}} of three children. He {{attended}} the Latin School of Chicago, where he graduated in 1990. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Williams College, majoring in Theater and minoring in Computer Science. Afterward, he earned his Master of Fine Arts degree from Columbia University in Acting, and performed on Broadway (New York City), at the American Repertory Theater in (Cambridge), at the Mark Taper Forum in (Los Angeles), at Cincinnati's Playhouse in the Park, and at the Williamstown Theater Festival. As a child, Freeman was greatly influenced by anime shows such as Speed Racer and Battle of the Planets. Casey Kasem voiced the role of his favorite character, Mark of Battle of the Planets (he actually wanted to change his name to Mark at one point). Later, he discovered Voltron, Star Blazers, and Robotech, being quoted in the January 1999 issue of America Interview saying, [...] "That show really blew me away." [...] Freeman has also stated that the reason {{he got into the}} industry was because of the anime television show The Vision of Escaflowne. Freeman initially got involved in the anime <b>voice-over</b> industry <b>when</b> a friend of his landed a role in Peacock King.|$|R
5000|$|John Godson, who was {{directing}} {{the news that}} night remembered, When Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon's surface, the whole BBC control room, with the canteen ladies and security guards standing beside the vision control desk, exploded into cheering and clapping. To us {{it had been a}} similar type of relief as it must have been to Armstrong, his crew and Ground Control. Up to now, nothing had gone wrong. I vividly recall we had Armstrong's 'One small step' spiel with very little distortion, considering he was in full lunar gear. I mean, it was easily comprehensible though, shall we say, slightly garbled. It was quite difficult to make any visual sense out of the first pictures from the lunar surface, as I recollect. But under those circumstances we would have had James Burke describe, voice-over, {{what we were trying to}} assimilate with our eyes. I was there to direct the situation - to decide <b>when</b> <b>voice-over</b> explanations were required, to be ready to take actions if the picture circuits failed. In fact, it resulted in quite a calm overnight operation with, if I remember correctly, not a single major panic situation other than numerous sound comprehension problems.|$|R
