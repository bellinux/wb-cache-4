5|$|Boron is {{a special}} case, being the only nonmetal in group 13. The alkali metal borides tend to be boron-rich, {{involving}} appreciable boron–boron bonding involving deltahedral structures, and are thermally unstable due to the alkali metals having a very high <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> at elevated temperatures. This makes direct synthesis problematic because the alkali metals do not react with boron below 700°C, and thus this must be accomplished in sealed containers with the alkali metal in excess. Furthermore, exceptionally in this group, reactivity with boron decreases down the group: lithium reacts completely at 700°C, but sodium at 900°C and potassium not until 1200°C, and the reaction is instantaneous for lithium but takes hours for potassium. Rubidium and caesium borides have not even been characterised. Various phases are known, such as LiB10, NaB6, NaB15, and KB6. Under high pressure the boron–boron bonding in the lithium borides changes from following Wade's rules to forming Zintl anions {{like the rest of}} group 13.|$|E
5|$|Electrostatic forces between {{particles}} are strongest when {{the charges are}} high, and {{the distance between the}} nuclei of the ions is small. In such cases, the compounds generally have very high melting and boiling points and a low <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure.</b> Trends in melting points can be even better explained when the structure and ionic size ratio is taken into account. Above their melting point ionic solids melt and become molten salts (although some ionic compounds such as aluminium chloride and iron(III) chloride show molecule-like structures in the liquid phase). Inorganic compounds with simple ions typically have small ions, and thus have high melting points, so are solids at room temperature. Some substances with larger ions, however, have a melting point below or near room temperature (often defined as up to 100°C), and are termed ionic liquids. Ions in ionic liquids often have uneven charge distributions, or bulky substituents like hydrocarbon chains, which also play a role in determining the strength of the interactions and propensity to melt.|$|E
25|$|Wood is a {{hygroscopic}} substance. It has {{the ability}} to take in or give off moisture in the form of vapour. Water contained in wood exerts <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> of its own, which is determined by the maximum size of the capillaries filled with water at any time. If water <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> in the ambient space is lower than <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> within wood, desorption takes place. The largest-sized capillaries, which are full of water at the time, empty first. <b>Vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> within the wood falls as water is successively contained in smaller capillaries. A stage is eventually reached when <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> within the wood equals <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> in the ambient space above the wood, and further desorption ceases. The amount of moisture that remains in the wood at this stage is in equilibrium with water <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> in the ambient space, and is termed the equilibrium moisture content or EMC (Siau, 1984). Because of its hygroscopicity, wood tends to reach a moisture content that is in equilibrium with the relative humidity and temperature of the surrounding air.|$|E

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} {{of the formation of}} secondary organic aerosol (SOA) to the estimated <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> of the condensable oxidation products is explored. A highly detailed reaction scheme was generated for α-pinene photooxidation using the Generator for Explicit Chemistry and Kinetics of Organics in the Atmosphere (GECKO-A). <b>Vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> (P vap) were estimated with three commonly used structure activity relationships. The values of P vap were compared for the set of secondary species generated by GECKO-A to describe α-pinene oxidation. Discrepancies in the predicted <b>vapour</b> <b>pressures</b> were found to increase with the number of functional groups borne by the species. For semi-volatile organic compounds (i. e. organic species of interest for SOA formation), differences in the predicted P vap range between a factor of 5 to 200 in average. The simulated SOA concentrations were compared to SOA observations in the Caltech chamber during three experiments performed under a range of NO x conditions. While the model captures the qualitative features of SOA formation for the chamber experiments, SOA concentrations are systematically overestimated.

25|$|Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) gas is a {{rapid and}} {{effective}} sterilant for use against {{a wide range}} of microorganisms, including common bacteria, viruses, and spores. The unique physical properties of NO2 gas allow for sterilant dispersion in an enclosed environment at room temperature and ambient pressure. The mechanism for lethality is the degradation of DNA in the spore core through nitration of the phosphate backbone, which kills the exposed organism as it absorbs NO2. This degradation occurs at even very low concentrations of the gas. NO2 has a boiling point of 21°C at sea level, which results in a relatively high saturated <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> at ambient temperature. Because of this, liquid NO2 may be used as a convenient source for the sterilant gas. Liquid NO2 is often referred to by the name of its dimer, dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). Additionally, the low levels of concentration required, coupled with the high <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure,</b> assures that no condensation occurs on the devices being sterilized. This means that no aeration of the devices is required immediately following the sterilization cycle. NO2 is also less corrosive than other sterilant gases, and is compatible with most medical materials and adhesives.|$|E
25|$|The boiling {{points of}} {{components}} in an azeotrope overlap {{to form a}} band. By exposing an azeotrope to a vacuum or positive pressure, it's possible to bias the boiling point of one component {{away from the other}} by exploiting the differing <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> curves of each; the curves may overlap at the azeotropic point, but are unlikely to be remain identical further along the pressure axis either side of the azeotropic point. When the bias is great enough, the two boiling points no longer overlap and so the azeotropic band disappears.|$|E
25|$|Relative humidity: The {{relative}} humidity of air {{is defined as}} the partial pressure of water vapour divided by the saturated <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> at the same temperature and total pressure (Siau, 1984). If the temperature is kept constant, lower relative humidities result in higher drying rates due to the increased moisture gradient in wood, resulting from the reduction of the moisture content in the surface layers when the {{relative humidity}} of air is reduced. The relative humidity is usually expressed on a percentage basis. For drying, the other essential parameter related to relative humidity is the absolute humidity, which is the mass of water vapour per unit mass of dry air (kg of water per kg of dry air).However, its influenced by the amount of water in the heated air.|$|E
40|$|The {{removal of}} noxious and air {{pollutant}} substances from exhaust gases {{has become a}} routine procedure in the glass industry. Nevertheless, process control is still based on empirical data and {{on the experience of}} the plant operators. In the past, the occasional and unexpected occurrence of aggressive fluxes in the electrostatic precipitator (e-filters) has troubled several operators. This is unsatisfactory since the occurrence could not be attributed in a clear way to any unfavourable boundary conditions. This thesis presents investigations on the thermodynamic and kinetic conditions in Na 2 O-H 2 O-SO 2 -CO 2 -N 2 -containing flue gases below 500 °C. Investigations are particularly focused on the formation of liquid and solid sodium pyrosulphates and sodium bisulphates. Special attention is paid to mechanisms of their occurrence and avoidance inside flue gas filters. It is shown that the formation is strongly dependent on the oxygen- and water <b>vapour</b> partial <b>pressure</b> of the system.
