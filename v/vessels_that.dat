5|$|In 1854, {{during the}} Tokugawa shogunate, Japanese ships {{were ordered to}} hoist the Hinomaru to {{distinguish}} themselves from foreign ships. Before then, different types of Hinomaru flags were used on <b>vessels</b> <b>that</b> were trading with the U.S. and Russia. The Hinomaru was decreed the merchant flag of Japan in 1870 and was the legal national flag from 1870 to 1885, making it the first national flag Japan adopted.|$|E

50|$|A {{minehunter}} is a naval <b>vessel</b> <b>that</b> seeks, detects, and destroys individual naval mines. Minesweepers, on {{the other}} hand, clear mined areas as a whole, without prior detection of mines. A <b>vessel</b> <b>that</b> combines both of these roles {{is known as a}} mine countermeasures vessel (MCMV).|$|R
5|$|The Antarctic scallop is {{monitored}} {{in connection with}} the Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VME) classification set up by the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). As such, notification is required to be made by <b>vessels</b> <b>that</b> land the scallop as by-catch during their fishing activities.|$|E
5|$|The Ficus genus is {{composed}} of 800 species of vines, shrubs, and trees, including the cultivated fig, defined by their syconiums, the fruit-like <b>vessels</b> <b>that</b> either hold female flowers or pollen on the inside. Each fig species has its own fig wasp which (in most cases) pollinates the fig, so a tight mutual dependence has evolved and persisted throughout the genus.|$|E
5|$|The St George's Cross defaced {{with the}} arms of Dunkirk flown from the jack staff is the {{warranted}} house flag of the Association of Dunkirk Little Ships. It {{is known as the}} Dunkirk jack. The flag is flown only by civilian <b>vessels</b> <b>that</b> took part in the Dunkirk rescue operation.|$|E

This figure {{did not include}} financial losses in coastal cities.|$|E
5|$|The town {{continued}} to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment. During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going <b>vessels</b> <b>that</b> shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on Market Square. In 1797, the manufacture of glass began.|$|E
5|$|These attacks led the United States, Britain, China, Australia {{and several}} other states to {{formally}} declare war on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan. Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States in solidarity with Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war <b>vessels</b> <b>that</b> had been ordered by Roosevelt.|$|E

5|$|Accordingly, {{building}} a new oil terminal in Europe capable of handling the largest <b>vessels</b> <b>that</b> were planned was judged appropriate. The intention was that oil coming from the Middle East would be off-loaded at this terminal and then stored for trans-shipment to European refineries using smaller vessels. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 {{as a result of}} the Six-Day War reinforced the economic viability of this scheme. Oil shipments had to come round the Cape of Good Hope, thus avoiding the vessel size constraints previously imposed by the canal.|$|E
5|$|Bayard's Cove Fort, {{also known}} {{historically}} as Berescove or Bearscore Castle, is an English 16th-century artillery blockhouse, built {{to defend the}} harbour entrance at Dartmouth in Devon. Constructed {{in the early part}} of the century, it had eleven gunports for heavy artillery and was intended to engage enemy <b>vessels</b> <b>that</b> broke past the external defences of the Dartmouth and Kingswear castles. It remained armed during the English Civil War, but was neglected in the 18th century and used for storage. The fort was restored in the late 19th century and is now managed by English Heritage and open to visitors.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods {{also have}} colorless blood, {{circulated}} by a muscular heart {{lying in the}} dorsal {{part of the body}} above the stomach. The blood passes through <b>vessels</b> <b>that</b> extend to the front and back of the body, and branch to organs including the lophophore at the front and the gut, muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The blood circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid and blood must mix to a degree. The main function of the blood may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E

5|$|By July Bellerophon {{was part}} of a {{squadron}} commanded by Captain Thomas Byam Martin of HMS Implacable. They were off Percola Point on 7 July when a flotilla of eight Russian gunboats was sighted. A boat party led by Lieutenant Hawkey of Implacable made an attempt to cut-out the <b>vessels</b> <b>that</b> evening. Hawkey was killed in the attempt, but Bellerophons Lieutenant Charles Allen took over command, and six of the gunboats were captured, and a seventh destroyed, with 12 craft containing stores for the Russian Army also being taken. Bellerophon made several cruises {{during the rest of the}} year, visiting the Åland Islands and Karlskrona, before returning to Britain with a convoy in November 1809.|$|E
5|$|By sea: Banton is {{accessible}} via wooden launches and motorized boats that regularly travel from Lucena City, Quezon. Tourists and visitors {{can also take}} RORO <b>vessels</b> <b>that</b> ply the Manila-Odiongan, Batangas City-Odiongan, or the Roxas-Odiongan route. From Odiongan, Banton {{can be reached by}} jeepney and motorized boat via Calatrava, Romblon. Another RORO route is from Lucena City to Boac or Mogpog in Marinduque. From these towns, travelers can take jeepneys to Buenavista, which is only three hours away from Banton. Another alternative route is through Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro by motorized boats.|$|E

However, upon {{learning}} that Lucifer has escaped destruction, now jumping through <b>vessels</b> <b>that</b> rapidly burn out due to his weakened state making it harder for him to maintain them, Castiel sets out to find Lucifer, accompanied by Crowley, although their first attempt simply sees Rowena banish Lucifer's new vessel {{to the bottom of the}} ocean without actually managing to kill him.|$|E

5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small <b>vessels</b> <b>that</b> supply blood to the vital organs, and the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of the Commonwealth, 1649–60, {{wholesale}} iconoclasm was wrought on all the pictorial elements of Christian buildings. Most of England’s medieval stained glass was smashed. The majority of England’s medieval statues were smashed or defaced leaving only a few isolated examples intact. Medieval paintings almost disappeared. Vestments embroidered in the famous style known as Opus Anglicanum were burnt. Those medieval Communion <b>vessels</b> <b>that</b> had escaped the Dissolution were melted down so that only about 50 items of pre-Reformation church plate remain.|$|E
5|$|Other major {{employers}} {{in the county}} include: BAE Systems, Sunseeker International, J.P. Morgan, Cobham plc and Bournemouth University. Dorset's three ports, Poole, Weymouth and Portland, and the smaller harbours of Christchurch, Swanage, Lyme Regis, Wareham and West Bay generate {{a substantial amount of}} international trade and tourism. Around 230 fishing <b>vessels</b> <b>that</b> predominantly catch crab and lobster are based in Dorset's ports. When the waters around Weymouth and Portland were chosen for the sailing events in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, the area underwent an increased investment in infrastructure and a growth in the marine leisure sector. It is expected that this will continue to {{have a positive effect on}} local businesses and tourism.|$|E
