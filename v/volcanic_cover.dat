50|$|The ancient marine basin {{that the}} Great Valley Sequence was {{deposited}} in very closely approximates the combined {{extent of the}} modern Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin Valley as delineated by the California Coast Ranges {{on the west side}} and the Sierra Nevada on the east. Geologists believe that the west boundary of this ancient seaway was made up of uplifted rocks of the Franciscan Assemblage that today make up the Coast Ranges. By contrast, the east boundary was a chain of ancient volcanoes located where the Sierra Nevada is today. As these ancient Sierran volcanoes were rapidly eroded they fed volcanic-derived sediment through submarine canyons westward to the ancient submarine fans of the Great Valley Sequence. Additional sediment was fed into the basin as the granitic roots of these volcanoes were uplifted and eroded. As a consequence, the <b>volcanic</b> <b>cover</b> of the Sierra Nevada has been largely stripped off and used by nature to fill the Great Valley basin.

40|$|International audienceWe {{document}} {{evidence for}} growth {{of an active}} volcano in a compressional Andean setting. Our data are surface structures and 39 Ar- 40 Ar ages of volcanic products on Tromen volcano. Tromen is an active back-arc volcano in the Andean foothills of Neuquèn province, Argentina. Its volcanic products are unconformable upon Mesozoic strata of the Neuquèn basin. The volcano straddles a N-S trending pop-up, which formed during E-W shortening. The main underlying structures are eastward verging thrusts. Their traces curve around the eastern foot of the volcano. Minor folds and faults also occur in the <b>volcanic</b> <b>cover</b> of Tromen, {{as a result of}} E-W shortening. New 39 Ar- 40 Ar ages for these volcanic rocks are younger than 2. 27 ± 0. 10 Ma and show that Tromen has been active almost continuously from the late Pliocene to the Holocene. We conclude that volcanism and thrusting have been coeval and that magma must have reached the surface in a tectonic setting of horizontal compression. Our results have wider implications for magmatic processes in such settings...|$|E

40|$|Geothermal energy {{exploration}} {{is based}} in part on interpretation of the chemistry, temperature, and discharge rate of thermal springs. Here we present the major element chemistry and the δD, δ 18 O, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and δ 11 B isoto- pic ratio of groundwater from the low-enthalpy geothermal system near the city of Viterbo in the Cimino-Vico volcanic district of west-Central Italy. The geothermal system hosts many thermal springs and gas vents, but the resource is still unexploited. Water chemistry is controlled by mixing between low salinity,HCO 3 -rich fresh waters (b 24. 2 °C) flowing in shallow volcanic rocks and SO 4 -rich thermal waters (25. 3 °C to 62. 2 °C) ascending from deep, high permeability Mesozoic limestones. The (equivalent) SO 4 /Cl (0. 01 – 0. 02), Na/Cl (2. 82 – 5. 83) and B/Cl ratios (0. 02 – 0. 38) of thermal waters differs from the ratios in other geothermal systems from Central Italy, probably implying a lack of hydraulic continuity across the region. The δ 18 O (− 6. 6 ‰ to − 5. 9 ‰) and δD (− 40. 60 ‰ to − 36. 30 ‰) isotopic composition of spring water suggest that the recharge area for the geothermal system is the summit region of Mount Cimino. The strontium isotope ratios (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) of thermal waters (0. 70797 – 0. 70805) are consistent with dissolution of the Mesozoic evaporite-carbonate units that constitute the reservoir, and the ratios of cold fresh waters mainly reflect shallow circulation through the <b>volcanic</b> <b>cover</b> and some minor admixture (b 10 %) of thermal water as well. The boron isotopic composition (δ 11 B) of fresh waters (− 5. 00 and 6. 12 ‰) {{is similar to that of}} the <b>volcanic</b> <b>cover,</b> but the δ 11 B of thermal waters (− 8. 37 ‰ to − 4. 12 ‰) is a mismatch for the Mesozoic reservoir rocks and instead reflects dissolution of secondary boron min- erals during fluid ascent through flysch units that overlie the reservoir. A slow and tortuous ascent enhances ex- traction of boron but also promotes conductive cooling, partially masking the heat present in the reservoir. Overall data from this study is consistent with previous studies that concluded that the geothermal system has a large energy potential...|$|E

A number of domal outcrops of the Archcan basement are exposed in the Witwatersrand hinterland, revealing the presence of a diverse suite of granitoids and a minor (< 20 %) greenstone belt component. In addition, samples from over 130 boreholes drilled adjacent to the basin have revealed the character of subsurface Archcan basement beneath early Proterozoic sedimentary and <b>volcanic</b> <b>cover.</b> The granitic subsurface basement is commonly characterized by pervasive hydrothermal alteration evident as propylitization, sericitization, carbonation, and greisenization, as well as a variety of vein-related alterations comprising quartz + K-feldspar + chlorite + CO 3 [...] - sulfide + fluorite parageneses.

A U-Pb age of 183 ± 2. 1 Ma, with no detectable inheritance, on zircons from an orthogneiss from Cape Berteaux provides the first reliable age for the orthogneisses, which are interpreted as metamorphosed silicic volcanic rocks, and Sm-Nd data indicate derivation in a mature volcanic arc. The age indicates they may be correlatives of the Jurassic ‘Chon Aike’ volcanism of the eastern Antarctic Peninsula.

40|$|Beta Regio is {{characterized}} by the existence of rift structures. We compiled new geologic maps of Beta Regio according to Magellan data. There are many large uplifted tesserae on beta upland. These tesserae are partly buried by younger <b>volcanic</b> <b>cover.</b> We can conclude, using these observations, that Beta upland formed mainly due to lithospheric tectonic uplifting and was only partly constructed by volcanism. Theia Mons is the center of the Beta rift system. Many rift belts are distributed radially to Theia Mons. Typical widths of rifts are 40 - 160 km. Rift valleys are structurally represented by crustal grabens or half-grabens. There are symmetrical and asymmetrical rifts. Many rifts have shoulder uplifts up to 0. 5 - 1 km high and 40 - 60 km wide. Preliminary analysis for rift valley structural cross sections lead to the conclusion that rifts originated due to 5 - 10 percent crustal extension. Many rifts traverse Beta upland and spread to the surrounding lowlands. We can assume because of these data that Beta rift system has an active-passive origin. It formed due to regional tectonic lithospheric extension. Rifting was accelerated by upper-mantle hot spot origination under the center of passive extension (under the Beta Regio) ...|$|E

40|$|Twenty-five new 40 Ar / 39 Ar ages from {{volcanic}} {{rocks and}} veins {{in the western}} San Juan Mountains clarify relationships between volcanism and mineralization in this classic area. Five calc-alkaline ash-flow sheets erupted from caldera sources (Ute Ridge, Blue Mesa, Dillon Mesa, Sapinero Mesa, and Crystal Lake Tuffs) from 28. 6 to 27. 6 Ma. This {{is a much more}} restricted time interval than previously thought and indicates that the underlying batholith rose and evolved very rapidly beneath the western San Juan Mountains. The new ages and geologic relations constrain the timing of joint resurgence of the Uncompahgre and San Juan calderas to between 28. 2 and 27. 6 Ma. The collapse of the Silverton caldera produced a set of strong ring fractures that intersected with graben faults on the earlier resurgent dome to produce the complex set of structures that localized the mid-Miocene epithermal gold veins. Later calc-alkaline monzonitic to quartz monzontic plutons solidified at 26. 5 - 26. 0 Ma as the underlying batholith rose through its <b>volcanic</b> <b>cover.</b> A new age from lavas near Uncompahgre Peak supports earlier interpretations that these lavas were fed by nearby 26 Ma monzonite intrusions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a magnetotelluric (MT) {{survey of the}} unstable eastern flank of Mt Etna. We take thirty soundings along profiles oriented in the N-S and NW-SE directions, and from these data recover two 2 D resistivity models of the subsurface. Both models reveal three major layers in a resistive-conductive-resistive sequence, the deepest extending to 14 km bsl. The shallow layer corresponds to the <b>volcanic</b> <b>cover,</b> and the intermediate conductive layer corresponds to underlying sediments segmented by faults. These two electrical units are cut by ~ E-W-striking faults. The third layer (basement) is interpreted as mainly pertinent to the Apennine-Maghrebian Chain associated with ~ SE-NW-striking regional faults. The detailed shapes of the resistivity profiles clearly show that the NE Rift is shallow-rooted (~ 0 - 1 km bsl), thus presumably fed by lateral dikes from the central volcano conduit. The NW-SE profile {{is characterized by a}} series of listric faults reaching up to 3 km bsl, then becoming almost horizontal. Towards the SE, the resistive basement dramatically dips (from ~ 3 km to ~ 10 km bsl), in correspondence with the Timpe Fault System. Several high-conductivity zones close to the main faults suggest the presence of hydrothermal activity and fluid circulation that could enhance flank instability. Our results provide new findings about the geometry of the unstable Etna flank and its relation to faults and subsurface structures...|$|E

A significant and possible major economic {{example of the}} practical value of Skylab photographs was provided by locating on Skylab Camera Station Number 4, frame 010, SL- 2, an area of exposures of limestone rocks which {{were thought to be}} completely covered by volcanic rocks based upon prior mapping. The area is located less than 12 miles north of the Ruth porphyry copper deposit, White Pine County, Nevada. This is a major copper producing open pit mine owned by Kennecott Copper Corporation.
