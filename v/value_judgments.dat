50|$|A <b>value</b> <b>{{judgment}}</b> is {{a judgment}} of the rightness or wrongness of something or someone, or of the usefulness of something or someone, based on a comparison or other relativity. As a generalization, a <b>value</b> <b>judgment</b> can refer to a judgment based upon {{a particular set of}} values or on a particular value system. A related meaning of <b>value</b> <b>judgment</b> is an expedient evaluation based upon limited information at hand, an evaluation undertaken because a decision must be made on short notice. Value judgement is a fact which can be judged.|$|R

25|$|Often, if {{the skill}} {{is being used}} in a common or {{practical}} way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art. Some art followers {{have argued that the}} difference between fine art and applied art {{has more to do with}} <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> made about the art than any clear definitional difference. However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see aesthetics); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong emotions. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.|$|E

In this case the quality of judgment suffers because the information available is incomplete {{as a result of}} exigency, rather than as a result of cultural or personal limitations.|$|R
25|$|The {{fieldwork}} {{leading up}} to French DNA: Trouble in Purgatory focused on a multidimensional crisis revolving around a proposal for commercial collaboration between an American biotechnology start-up company and the French laboratory that led the genome sequencing effort in France, the CEPH. As opposed to his earlier book, French Modern, French DNA is not {{a history of the}} present but an initial case study in the anthropology of the contemporary. Rabinow accepted the challenge from the Center’s scientific director to be a 'philosophic observer.’ His task was to identify the formation of constellations of <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> around new forms of scientific knowledge, and to make that process available for further debate and modification, not to adjudicate disputes. The text is in part a meditation on committed ‘disinterestedness:’ “a certain vocational integrity, an asceticism in Weber and Foucault's senses, a certain rigor and patience that could, lead us somewhere beyond what we already believe and know.” This work still emphasizes the observation in “participant-observation” and can be contrasted to latter work at SynBERC in which both poles are put into play.|$|E
25|$|The revised {{sequence}} concept {{applies only}} to the industrial system – that is, the manufacturing core {{of the economy in}} which each industry contains only a handful of very powerful corporations. It does not apply to the market system in the Galbraithian dual economy. In the market system, composed of the vast majority of business organizations, price competition remains the dominant form of social control. In the industrial system, however, composed of the 1,000 or so largest corporations, competitive price theory obscures the relation to the price system of these large and powerful corporations. In Galbraith's view, the principal function of market relations in this industrial system is, not to constrain the power of the corporate behemoths, but to serve as an instrument for the implementation of their power. Moreover, the power of these corporations extends into commercial culture and politics, allowing them to exercise considerable influence upon popular social attitudes and <b>value</b> <b>judgments.</b> That this power is exercised in the shortsighted interest of expanding commodity production and the status of the few is both inconsistent with democracy and a barrier to achieving the quality of life that the new industrial state with its affluence could provide.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{commonly}} {{the term}} <b>value</b> <b>judgment</b> {{refers to an}} individual's opinion. Of course, the individual's opinion is formed to a degree by their belief system, and the culture to which they belong. So {{a natural extension of}} the term <b>value</b> <b>judgment</b> is to include declarations seen one way from one value system, but which may be seen differently from another. Conceptually this extension of definition is related both to the anthropological axiom [...] "cultural relativism" [...] (that is, that cultural meaning derives from a context) and to the term [...] "moral relativism" [...] (that is, that moral and ethical propositions are not universal truths, but stem from cultural context). A <b>value</b> <b>judgment</b> formed within a specific value system may be parochial, and may be subject to dispute in a wider audience.|$|R
5000|$|As an example, {{scientific}} [...] "truths" [...] {{are considered}} objective, but are held tentatively, {{with the understanding}} that more careful evidence and/or wider experience might change matters. Further, a scientific view (in the sense of a conclusion based upon a value system) is a <b>value</b> <b>judgment</b> that is socially constructed based upon rigorous evaluation and wide consensus. With this example in mind, characterizing a view as a <b>value</b> <b>judgment</b> is vague without description of the context surrounding it.|$|R

There he argued that economics as science should be free of <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> for it to be objective. Moreover, a useful economic theory should be judged not by its descriptive realism but by its simplicity and fruitfulness as an engine of prediction. That is, students should measure the accuracy of its predictions, rather than the 'soundness of its assumptions'. His argument was part of an ongoing debate among such statisticians as Jerzy Neyman, Leonard Savage, and Ronald Fisher.|$|E

500|$|Moralistic {{judgments}} implying wrongness or badness on {{the part}} of people who don't act in harmony with our values. Blame, insults, put-downs, labels, criticisms, comparisons, and diagnoses are all said to be forms of judgment. (Moralistic judgments are {{not to be confused with}} <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> as to the qualities we value.) The use of moralistic judgments is characterized as an impersonal way of expressing oneself that does not require one to reveal what is going on inside of oneself.

500|$|Many feminists call {{attention}} to <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> in economic analysis. This idea {{is contrary to the}} typical conception of economics as a positive science held by many practitioners. For example, Geoff Schneider and Jean Shackelford suggest that [...] "the issues that economists choose to study, the kinds of questions they ask, and the type of analysis undertaken all are a product of a belief system which is influenced by numerous factors, some of them ideological in character." [...] Similarly, Diana Strassmann comments, [...] "All economic statistics are based on an underlying story forming the basis of the definition. In this way, narrative constructions necessarily underlie all definitions of variables and statistics. [...] Therefore, economic research cannot escape being inherently qualitative, regardless of how it is labeled." [...] Feminist economists {{call attention}} to the value judgements in all aspects economics and criticize its depiction of an objective science.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{scientific}} and academic literature on the definition or categorization of mental disorders, one extreme argues that it is entirely a matter of <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> (including of what is normal) while another proposes that it is or could be entirely objective and scientific (including by reference to statistical norms); other views argue that the concept refers to a [...] "fuzzy prototype" [...] {{that can never be}} precisely defined, or that the definition will always involve a mixture of scientific facts (e.g. that a natural or evolved function isn't working properly) and <b>value</b> <b>judgments</b> (e.g. that it is harmful or undesired).
