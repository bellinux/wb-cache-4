40|$|The {{discovery}} of {{the wreck of the}} brigMercurio, which sank in 1812 in the waters of the north Adriatic, is of major significance for the study of Italic Kingdom vessels from the Napoleonic era. The underwater excavations carried out in 2004 – 11 led to the recovery of many small finds, among which are several gunflints of different size and shape. The Mercurio gunflints were produced mainly from blades using a technique in use in Britain and France, but also in the workshops of the Lessini Hills around Ceredo (<b>Verona</b> <b>province,</b> northern Italy). We suggest that the flint employed for their manufacture probably came from Monte Baldo, in the Trentino, or perhaps from the River Tagliamento, in Friuli. We can exclude the possibility that the specimens recovered from the shipwreck were made from French flint because of the typically north Italian manufacturing technique and the character of the grey Treveti derived flint. Given the complexity of the period during which the Grado (or Pirano) battle took place, the study of even such small items can contribute to a better interpretation of the dramatic events that characterised the beginning of the nineteenth century {{in that part of the}} Mediterranean...|$|E
40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} {{collection}} {{is a public}} service with impact on the environment, public health, {{and the appearance of}} a municipal area.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of amber from the world-famous fossil-lagerstatte of Pesciara di Bolca (<b>Verona</b> <b>province)</b> is here {{reported for the}} first time.

Then, the amber from Bolca has been compared with other ambers of similar age.

Moreover, the fossil assemblages allowed to reconstruct the palaeoenvironments, stressing they were in both case on a shallow carbonate platform, relatively close to the shoreline.

40|$|The {{fossil record}} of amber {{dates back to}} the Palaeozoic, but it is only since the Mesozoic that amber became {{relatively}} common, probably because of the spreading of resin-producing plants. In Italy, the oldest ambers come from the Middle and Upper Triassic of the Dolomites. Cretaceous ambers come from some Albian sites in the Dolomites and from the Coniacian–Santonian of Vernasso, Julian Prealps, northern Italy. Until now, no Jurassic sites with amber have been reported in Italy, and this “Jurassic gap” seems generalized, since {{there are only a few}} Jurassic ambers described all over the world. Here, we report the first finding of Lower Jurassic (Pliensbachian) amber from the Bellori locality (Grezzana, <b>Verona</b> <b>Province,</b> Northern Italy). The amber was found in two clayey-coal levels containing plant remains and cuticles, with subordinate bivalves, foraminifera and ostracods. Palynomorphs of the amber levels are dominated by levigate and ornamented spores (ferns) and Circumpolles (conifers). Foraminiferal linings and algal cysts are also present. The freshwater alga Pseudoschizaea is reported for the first time from the Lower Jurassic. The amber shows different kinds of preservation, some peculiar features probably connected with the plant structure, and colours ranging from light yellow to blackish red. Moreover, it includes millimetre-sized wood structures (“mummified wood”) and gas bubbles. Fourier-transform–Infrared, thermogravimetric and differential thermogravimetric analyses were carried out and resulted in a clear characterization of this amber with respect to all others known so far. These data, together with sedimentological observations and fossil content analysis, suggest a coastal palaeoenvironment under rather wet conditions, comparable with the present-day Everglades, with the addition of a monsoonal climate as in the modern southern Asia...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} geo-statistical {{analysis}} applied to seismic noise measurements {{in the framework}} of a thermal basin characterization. The site test is located in the N-E part of Italy (Caldiero, <b>Verona</b> <b>Province)</b> where more than 100 passive single station seismic noise measurements were conducted. The final aim was the characterization of an important hydrothermal basin, which is exploited since the Roman Period. The huge amount of measurements offers high density cover, since the measurements point has average spacing of 100 m for a total area investigated of ca 100 ha. The HVSR (Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio) is a geophysical passive technique used to retrieve fundamental resonance frequency of the subsoil. The measurement consists in passive recording of seismic noise with 3 components broadband receivers. From the spectral analysis of the recorded data, we can retrieve the resonance frequency of soil and hence information about depth and mechanical properties of soil covers. Since HVSR is a punctual measurement, 2 d map of the results are usually extracted with interpolation procedure, as common kriging or natural neighbor techniques. Despite this accurate statistical procedure are rarely adopted for HVSR analysis, limiting the real significance of the dataset. As a matter of fact, rigorous statistical approach of the spatial distribution is neglected in common HVSR geophysical prospecting. Here we present the use of advanced spatial-statistic technique (e. g. cross-validation, residual distribution etc.) applied to HVSR data. Our results show as critic data scrubbing, joined to rigorous statistical approach for data interpolation, are mandatory to assure meaningful structural interpretation of microtremor HVSR survey. The maps obtained are compared with boreholes data, reflection seismic prospecting, and geological information. The proposed procedure highlighted the potential of these quick passive measurements, if correctly treated from the statistical point of view...|$|E
40|$|Background: Quinoxyfen is a {{fungicide}} of the phenoxyquinoline class used {{to control}} powdery mildew, Uncinula necator (Schw.) Burr. Owing to its high persistence and strong sorption in soil, it could represent a risk for soil organisms if they are exposed at ecologically relevant concentrations. The objective {{of this paper is}} to predict the bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of quinoxyfen in earthworms, selected as a representative soil organism, and to assess the uncertainty in the estimation of this parameter. Three fields in each of four vineyards in southern and northern Italy were sampled over two successive years. Results: The measured BCFs varied over time, possibly owing to seasonal changes and the consequent changes in behaviour and ecology of earthworms. Quinoxyfen did not accumulate in soil, as the mean soil concentrations at the end of the 2 year monitoring period ranged from 9. 16 to 16. 0 μg kg - 1 dw for the <b>Verona</b> <b>province</b> and from 23. 9 to 37. 5 μg kg - 1 dw for the Taranto province, with up to eight applications per season. To assess the uncertainty of the BCF in earthworms, a probabilistic approach was used, firstly by building with weighted bootstrapping techniques a generic probabilistic density function (PDF) accounting for variability and incompleteness of knowledge. The generic PDF was then used to derive prior distribution functions, which, by application of Bayes' theorem, were updated with the new measurements and a posterior distribution was finally created. Conclusion: The study is a good example of probabilistic risk assessment. The means of mean and SD posterior estimates of log BCFworm (2. 06, 0. 91) are the 'best estimate values'. Further risk assessment of quinoxyfen and other phenoxyquinoline fungicides and realistic representative scenarios for modelling exercises required for future authorization and post-authorization requirements can now use this value as input. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|E
40|$|Avian Metapneumovirus (AMPV) is {{the casual}} agent of Turkey Rhinotracheitis (TRT), and also causes a {{respiratory}} infection in chickens, which {{can result in}} Swollen Head Syndrome (SHS). A survey of AMPV infection in 122 turkey and 48 broiler farms, in a highly densely populated area of Northern Italy, performed from January 2011 to February 2013, is reported. Positive AMPV samples were detected using or RT-nested PCR or qRT-PCR both able to detect and differentiate AMPV subtype A and B. All samples but one resulted positive for AMPV subtype B confirming the high prevalence of this subtype in Italy. Only one AMPV subtype A was detected in a turkey farm located in <b>Verona</b> <b>province.</b> The majority of AMPV detections were of field origin, circulating mainly from 9 to 12 weeks of age in turkeys and from 5 to 7 weeks of age in broilers, and associated with respiratory symptoms. Turkeys were all vaccinated at 1 day {{of age in the}} hatchery. The reasons for vaccine failure could be field virus changes in key antigenic regions that allow replication and leading to disease in well vaccinated birds. Our study revealed that VC 03 vaccine strain can be detected in turkeys up to many weeks after vaccination, with a high prevalence in the first weeks after hatch. This confirmed the pattern seen previously for subtype A and B live vaccine which has been shown to persist on farm for 4 - 5 weeks. Uniquely in this study, apparently vaccine derived strains were observed in older turkeys of up to 84 days of age. It is unlikely that a vaccine persists on the same farm for such a long period, so it is likely that as observed in a previous study for AMPV subtype A, a vaccine-derived virus was present in the environment being able to circulate and affect turkey farms...|$|E

From the Southern Alps, since recent times, the occurrence of amber has been cited only sporadically. During the last decade, more comprehensive descriptions of amber findings have been published. The occurrence of amber from the world-famous fossil-lagerstätte of Pesciara di Bolca (<b>Verona</b> <b>province)</b> is here reported {{for the first time}} (Trevisani et al., 2004).

The presence of amber, never reported before, in the Pesciara di Bolca increases the already abundant fossil documentation of this unique paleontological site.

40|$|The “Pesciara di Bolca” (<b>Verona</b> <b>Province,</b> Northern Italy) {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous fossil-lagerstätten, known since the mid XVI century for its spectacularly-preserved fish faunas. The latter were {{extensively}} studied during past years (e. g. Sorbini, 1972), but little or no attention at all was deserved to the invertebrate microfauna (especially foraminiferans) and to the facies analysis. The larger foraminiferans present in the Pesciara succession were since now neglected because, showing signs of transport, they were considered as reworked. A careful analysis of the field and microfacies features allowed us to conclude the foraminiferans are certainly mostly transported, but with no signs of a real reworking. Moreover, the alveolinas assemblages from all the collected samples belong to the same biozone (Alveolina dainellii Zone, SBZ 11 or Middle Cuisian). The only exception regards some extraclasts in the lower portion of the succession, where silicified alveolinas indicate the underlying SBZ 10 (Alveolina oblonga Zone, Early Cuisian). Previously, the age of the Pesciara was given as Early-Middle Eocene, relying on a single-sample attribution to the nannoplankton zone NP 14 (Discoaster sublodoensis Zone; Medizza, 1975). Now, the alveolina assemblages recognized over the whole succession allow a more stable datation. The facies analysis allowed us to distinguish between strictly autochthonous micritic limestones and allochthonous biocalcarenites-biocalcirudites. The former represents the fish-bearing levels, probably settled within an oxygen-depleted paleoenvironment accounting for the exceptional preservation of fossils. The latter, containing the larger foraminiferans, were probably the result of storm-induced transport from nearby very shallow sea bottom. The presence of emerged lands close to the Pesciara “basin” is testified by several continental fossils of both plants and animals (especially insects). The recent discovery of amber within the Pesciara limestones reinforces this interpretation (Trevisani et al., 2005, in press).

In particular, it analyses the main models of inter-firm networks, both contractual and organisational, as emerging in the wine market in seven regions of five European countries: Loire (France), Trentino province (north-east Italy), <b>Verona</b> <b>province</b> (north-east Italy), Enna and Ragusa provinces (east Sicily, Italy), Douro and Porto regions (Portugal), Valencia (Spain), and selected regions of Hungary. The seven case studies are presented both individually and comparatively. The observation of concrete phenomena of inter-firm collaboration allows to compare more mature markets (like the French and the Italian ones) with markets that are undergoing a major restructuring process (like in Hungary) : the former being characterised by higher propensity to inter-firm collaboration and higher degree of contractual and organisational innovation than the latter in terms of identification of effective tools of networks. The different mix between territory-driven production strategies and brand-driven production strategies also influences the type of networks and their role along the supply chain in each of the examined areas. Some common trends are considered: the higher propensity to form networks in the production phase than in distribution; the tendency to use linked bilateral contracts to coordinate the supply and distribution chain vertically, where power and value are asymmetrically distributed, while organisational networks are mostly used for horizontal cooperation among producers having similar market shares and producing complementary products or seeking for similar services supply. The increasing concentration of economic power among distributors is deeply influencing this picture, reinforcing hierarchy in vertical networks, especially in private label production, and stimulating some form of horizontal coordination as an attempt to counterbalance that concentration. Domestic and trans-national networks are compared and the impact of wine regulation is considered on their respective emergence. The role of European policies in promoting domestic and transnational networks is also examined. This shows the lack of coordination between rural and industrial policies, on the one side, and the definition of a menu of contractual and organisational models to be used to implement these policies, on the other side. The definition of a European legal framework on inter-firm networks could contribute to the fostering of innovation and competitiveness of European enterprises in the global market. economic policy...|$|E
