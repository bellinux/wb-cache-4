5|$|Classic {{learning}} {{theories and}} the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction of interesting, tangential details to learning content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> <b>nonverbal</b> systems. This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.|$|E
5|$|In another study, {{students}} who read less-organized material performed better that students given organized material on tasks that required {{an application of}} the knowledge to problem-solving. This suggests that the inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when trainees are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the core material is and, therefore, the recall {{will not be as}} good and more errors will occur. This distortion can lead to a richer understanding of the material and facilitate transfer performance because trainees are required to form a macro structure of the instructional material. Research using the dual-coding paradigm also suggests that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and leads to deeper processing of information because it allows storage of material in both <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> <b>nonverbal</b> systems. When information is made easier to comprehend, material is processed less deeply, thus leading to poorer acquisition of information.|$|E

Due to developmental processes occurring during adolescence including myelinization and restructuring of the synapses, adolescents are thought to be more vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol.|$|E
25|$|There is <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> <b>nonverbal</b> {{guidance}} from parents {{to children with}} chores and other activities. For example, {{a pat on the}} shoulder can communicate to the child that he/she is doing the activity at hand the correct way. This example relates to the LOPI model by there being an appraisal from the parent(s) in order to support their progress in learning and contributing better in the community. As the child gradually advances towards more complex tasks, the goal of mastery and feedback on the adequacy of their contributions become more pronounced.|$|E
25|$|In some Native Hawaiian communities, {{there is}} a {{constant}} use of “talk story” which plays an essential role in promoting solidarity in the community by not overpowering or making the members of the community feel inadequate for not understanding something. Talk story can consist of recalled events, folktales, and joking. Joking can be used to tease and guide the children about how to do a chore better or to avoid serious trouble. Talk story relates to an Indigenous way of learning by providing conversations such as narratives and dramatizations with <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> <b>nonverbal</b> communication between the elder and children.|$|E

25|$|Even as {{clinical}} psychology was growing, working {{with issues of}} serious mental distress remained the domain of psychiatrists and neurologists. However, clinical psychologists continued to make inroads into this area due to their increasing skill at psychological assessment. Psychologists' reputation as assessment experts became solidified during World War I {{with the development of}} two intelligence tests, Army Alpha and Army Beta (testing <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> <b>nonverbal</b> skills, respectively), which could be used with large groups of recruits. Due {{in large part to the}} success of these tests, assessment was to become the core discipline of {{clinical psychology}} for the next quarter century, when another war would propel the field into treatment.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also thought}} that the test's {{reliability}} can depend substantially on details of the testing procedure, such as where the tester and subject are seated, any introductory words, <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> <b>nonverbal</b> responses to subjects' questions or comments, and how responses are recorded. Exner has published detailed instructions, but Wood et al. cites many court cases where these had not been followed. Similarly, the procedures for coding responses are fairly well specified but extremely time-consuming leaving them very subject to the author's style and the publisher {{to the quality of}} the instructions (such as was noted with one of Bohm's textbooks in the 1950s) as well as clinic workers (which would include examiners) being encouraged to cut corners.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{effective}} communication among patients and healthcare professionals {{is critical for}} achieving a patient's optimal health outcome. However, according to the Canadian Patient Safety Institute, ineffective communication has the opposite effect as {{it can lead to}} patient harm. Communication with regards to patient safety can be classified into two categories: prevention of adverse events and responding to adverse events. Use {{of effective}} communication can aid in the prevention of adverse events, whereas ineffective communication can contribute to these incidences. If ineffective communication contributes to an adverse event, then better and more effective communication skills must be applied in response to achieve optimal outcomes for the patient's safety. There are different modes in which healthcare professionals can work to optimize the safety of patients which include both <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> <b>nonverbal</b> communication, as well as the effective use of appropriate communication technologies.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} on the communication of affection has illuminated its implications for mental and physical health. In particular, affectionate communication {{has been shown to}} covary with healthy hormonal variation and accelerated recovery from stress. The present study focuses on the association between marital affection and hormonal markers of stress regulation, including cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S), and their ratio. Twenty healthy adults and their spouses provided independent reports of their propensity for <b>verbal,</b> <b>nonverbal,</b> <b>and</b> support-based expressions of affection prior to providing saliva samples that were assayed for cortisol and DHEA-S. As hypothesized, spouses’ reports of <b>verbal,</b> <b>nonverbal,</b> <b>and</b> supportive affection significantly predicted participants’ waking cortisol levels, cortisol change, and cortisol:DHEA-S ratio. Participants’ own reports of affection were predictive of cortisol:DHEA-S ratio for verbal affection behaviors only, and were not predictive of participants’ waking cortisol, cortisol change, or DHEA-S. In addition, spouses’ reports of <b>verbal,</b> <b>nonverbal,</b> <b>and</b> supportive affection predicted participants’ evening cortisol levels. Results illustrate that affectionate communication from one’s spouse is related to hormonal stress regulation and suggest the possibility that interventions designed to increase affectionate behavior in romantic relationships may have stress-ameliorating physiological effects...|$|R

50|$|On a broad level, individualistic {{cultures}} {{operate with}} a more direct, low-context facework with importance placed on <b>verbal</b> communication <b>and</b> <b>nonverbal</b> gestures for emphasis. Collectivistic cultures operate in a more indirect, high context facework emphasizing nonverbal subtleties. There are three prevalent facework strategies: dominating, avoiding, and integrating. Dominating facework is characterized by trying to maintain a credible image {{with the goal of}} winning the conflict. Avoiding facework attempts to preserve harmony in the relationship by dealing with the conflict indirectly. Integrating facework focuses on content resolution and maintaining the relationship.|$|R
25|$|Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots share a lot {{in common}} in their culture but also have differences. Several {{traditional}} food (such as souvla and halloumi) and beverages are similar, as well as expressions and ways of life. Hospitality and buying or offering food and drinks for guests or others are common among both. In both communities, music, dance and art are integral parts of social life and many artistic, <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> <b>nonverbal</b> expressions, traditional dances such as tsifteteli, similarities in dance costumes and importance placed on social activities are shared between the communities. However, the two communities have distinct religions and religious cultures, with the Greek Cypriots traditionally being Greek Orthodox and Turkish Cypriots traditionally being Sunni Muslims, which has partly hindered cultural exchange. Greek Cypriots have influences from Greece and Christianity, while Turkish Cypriots have influences from Turkey and Islam.|$|E
25|$|Methods of {{effective}} <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> <b>nonverbal</b> communication include treating patients {{with respect and}} showing empathy, clearly communicating with patients {{in a way that}} best fits their needs, practicing active listening skills, being sensitive with regards to cultural diversity and respecting the privacy and confidentiality rights of the patient. To use appropriate communication technology, healthcare professionals must choose which channel of communication is best suited to benefit the patient. Some channels are more likely to result in communication errors than others, such as communicating through telephone or email (missing nonverbal messages which are an important element of understanding the situation). It is also the responsibility of the provider to know the advantages and limitations of using electronic health records, as they do not convey all information necessary to understanding patient needs. If a health care professional is not practicing these skills, they are not being an effective communicator which may affect patient outcome.|$|E

2500|$|Skinner's views {{influenced}} {{education as}} well as psychology. Skinner argued that education has two major purposes: (1) to teach repertoires of both <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> <b>nonverbal</b> behavior; and (2) to interest students in learning. He recommended bringing students’ behavior under appropriate control by providing reinforcement only {{in the presence of}} stimuli relevant to the learning task. Because he believed that human behavior can be affected by small consequences, something as simple as [...] "the opportunity to move forward after completing one stage of an activity" [...] can be an effective reinforcer (Skinner, 1961, p.380). Skinner was convinced that, to learn, a student must engage in behavior, and not just passively receive information. (Skinner, 1961, p.389).|$|E
2500|$|A neuropsychological profile {{has been}} {{proposed}} for AS; if verified, it could differentiate between AS and HFA and aid in differential diagnosis. Relative to HFA, people with AS have deficits in nonverbal skills such as visual-spatial problem solving and visual-motor coordination, along with stronger verbal abilities. Several studies have found AS with a neuropsychologic profile of assets and deficits consistent with a nonverbal learning disability, but several other studies have failed to replicate this. The literature review did not reveal consistent findings of [...] "nonverbal weaknesses or increased spatial or motor problems relative to individuals with HFA", leading some researchers to argue that increased cognitive ability is evidenced in AS relative to HFA regardless of differences in <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> <b>nonverbal</b> ability.|$|E
