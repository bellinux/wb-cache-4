40|$|Abstract With {{this paper}} {{we suggest that}} <b>vegetation</b> <b>series</b> is a useful {{conceptual}} tool to identify a clear level of biodiversity of land systems among the many possible logical levels. The suggestion {{is supported by the}} results of a case study carried out for the province of Almeria (Spain) using the watersheds as operational geographic units. The application of standard correlation analysis, simple and partial, the Mantel?s test, and the cluster analysis has shown that ? and ? vegetation diversities, based on <b>vegetation</b> <b>series,</b> are significantly predictive with respect to environmental heterogeneity expressed by pedodiversity, lithodiversity, and some parameters of digital elevation model.

40|$|Although satellite-based sensors {{have made}} <b>vegetation</b> data <b>series</b> {{available}} for several decades, {{the detection of}} vegetation trend and change is not yet straightforward. This {{is partly due to}} the scarcity of available change detection algorithms suitable for identifying and characterizing both abrupt and non-abrupt changes, without sacrificing accuracy or computational speed. We propose a user-friendly program for analysing <b>vegetation</b> time <b>series,</b> with two main application domains: generalising vegetation trends to main features, and characterizing vegetation trend changes. This program, Detecting Breakpoints and Estimating Segments in Trend (DBEST) uses a novel segmentation algorithm which simplifies the trend into linear segments using one of three user-defined parameters: a generalisation-threshold parameter δ, the m largest changes, or a threshold β for the magnitude of changes of interest for detection. The outputs of DBEST are the simplified trend, the change type (abrupt or non-abrupt), and estimates for the characteristics (time and magnitude) of the change. DBEST was tested and evaluated using simulated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data at two sites, which included different types of changes. Evaluation results demonstrate that DBEST quickly and robustly detects both abrupt and non-abrupt changes, and accurately estimates change time and magnitude. DBEST was also tested using data from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) NDVI image time series for Iraq for the period 1982 – 2006, and was able to detect and quantify major change over the area. This showed that DBEST is able to detect and characterize changes over large areas. We conclude that DBEST is a fast, accurate and flexible tool for trend detection, and is applicable to global change studies using time series of remotely sensed data sets...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Area-pedo{{diversity}}, area?vegetation diversity, area-bioclimatic belts, {{diversity and}} pedodiversity-vegetation diversity-bioclimatic diversity relationships were analyzed {{for the most}} arid region ofWestern Europe (SE Spain). The study is novel in that it analyzed these relationships using as operational geographic units (OGUs) the set of polygons belonging to the same character state (i. e., typology) that defines a zone in a given thematic map. We considered three thematic maps: 1) the map of soil associations (SMU) with 303 different soil associations (i. e., 303 areas or zones); 2) the map of potential vegetation (PNV) with 40 <b>vegetation</b> <b>series</b> or zones and 3) the map of bioclimatic belts (BB) with 7 bioclimatic zones. Using GIS tools, we analyzed the contents (richness) of soil mapping units (polygons) with regard to <b>vegetation</b> <b>series</b> and bioclimatic belts {{as well as the}} contents of <b>vegetation</b> <b>series</b> and bioclimatic belts with regard to SMU. The results indicate that the relationships between the area and the richness of zones follow a power law, the ?fingerprint of fractal geometry?, irrespective of the way the area has been defined and their relative magnitude (the areas defined by SMU are the smallest, while the areas defined by bioclimatic belts are the largest). The results also indicate a significant correlation between the ? diversities of the zones and between their ? diversities. We conclude that the methods used to measure such correlations, based on ? and ? diversities are useful to investigate and quantify the relationships between the pedosphere, vegetation and climate...|$|E

40|$|A dynamic coupled biogeochemical-ecological {{model was}} used to {{simulate}} the effects of nitrogen deposition and climate change on plant communities at three forest sites in France. The three sites had different forest covers (sessile oak, Norway spruce and silver fir), three nitrogen loads ranging from relatively low to high, different climatic regions and different soil types. Both the availability of <b>vegetation</b> time <b>series</b> and the environmental niches of the understory species allowed to evaluate the model for predicting {{the composition of the}} three plant communities. The calibration of the environmental niches was successful, with a model performance consistently reasonably high throughout the three sites. The model simulations of two climatic and two deposition scenarios showed that climate change may entirely compromise the eventual recovery from eutrophication of the simulated plant communities in response to the reductions in nitrogen deposition. The interplay between climate and deposition was strongly governed by site characteristics and histories in the long term, while forest management remained the main driver of change in the short term...|$|R
40|$|Various {{compositing}} criteria {{have been}} proposed to produce cloud-free images from optical time series. However, they often favour specific atmospheric and geometric conditions, which may cause serious inconsistencies in the syntheses. Algorithms including BRDF normalization minimize variations induced by the anisotropy of the target. However, their operational implementation faces some issues. This study proposes to avoid these issues by using a new strategy based on a statistical approach, i. e. Mean Compositing, and by comparing it with three existing techniques. A quantitative evaluation methodology with statistical tests on reflectance and texture values as well as visual comparisons were applied to numerous SPOT <b>VEGETATION</b> time <b>series.</b> The performance criterion was to best mimic the information content of a single cloud-free near-nadir view image.

Our work allowed to resume the knowledge status of the vegetation studies carried out on the Island, identify the actual plant landscape, define the <b>vegetation</b> <b>series</b> and geoseries, as well as draw a map of their potential distribution. In total, 23 principal <b>vegetation</b> <b>series</b> were identified, with 21 of them being exclusive of the Sardinian biogeographic sub province and 2 of the Corsican-Sardinian province.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of open areas as grasslands and croplands {{has become a}} vital issue addressed to biodiversity conservation. For this purpose, innovation in agricultural activities may be a key factor. To achieve this goal, {{it is essential to}} identify the agronomic suitability and the most appropriate spatial pattern for the proposed cultivation. Therefore, the definition of land suitability classes and of their boundaries is a key step. For this purpose we used the phytosociological approach since it is based on an ecological definition and hierarchical classification of plant communities and landscapes and can be considered as an indirect way to assess the variation of the environmental conditions. Starting from the Marche Region vegetation geo-database, for each <b>vegetation</b> <b>series</b> a draft of the main ecological factors matching with the ecological needs of Crocus sativus L. was carried out. Afterwards, two intermediate maps were drawn: the “Climatic suitability map” and the “Soil suitability map”. Finally, the “Crocus sativus cultivation suitability map” was drawn by overlapping these two maps. Results were tested by agronomic experimentations. The synphytosociological approach proved to be a very valuable method. In fact, the areas belonging to the highlighted different suitability classes (that is the different <b>vegetation</b> <b>series)</b> showed substantial differences in the saffron productivity. Moreover using the vegetation mapping procedures also the definition of the borders of each suitability class has been easily solved at the landscape scale...|$|E

LCC can be described not only by its occurrence, but also by the land cover replacement, causal agent and change duration or recuperation. Nowadays, remote sensing offers the opportunity to assemble reliable time series, however this fails to make a characterization of LCC since the series represents dynamics due to the combination of several processes occurring simultaneously.
