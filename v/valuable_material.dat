5|$|Lakkanna Dandesa, the king's prime {{minister}} and provincial governor, wrote an encyclopaedia on the beliefs and rites of the Veerashaiva faith titled Sivatattva Chintamani. This work is {{an account of the}} life of Basavanna, the progenitor of the faith, and hundreds of his followers, making it <b>valuable</b> <b>material</b> for students of the Lingayat movement. Numerous references are made in this work to the capital city of Vijayanagara and its suburbs. Jakkanarya, a minister in the court, not only wrote Nurondusthala (one hundred and one stories) but also was patron to Kumarabanka Natha and Mahalinga Deva, poet-saints who wrote vachana poems and books on the Shaiva philosophy (called shatsthala). Other writers of the 15th century worthy of mention are Kavi Linga (1490), court poet of King Saluva NarasimhaI, Adrisappa (Praudaraya Charitra), Bommarasa (Soundara Purana), Kallarasa (Janavasya), Chaturmukha Bommarasa (Revanasiddhesvara Purana), Suranga Kavi (Trisashti Puratanara Charitre), and Nilakanthacharya (Aradhya Charitra), court poet of the Ummattur chieftain Virananjendra.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{attempted}} {{to slow the}} Japanese advance with an initial defense against the Japanese landings. MacArthur's plan for holding all of Luzon against the Japanese collapsed as it spread out the American-Filipino forces too thin. However, he reconsidered his confidence {{in the ability of}} his Filipino troops after the Japanese landing force made a rapid advance after landing at Lingayen Gulf on 21 December, and ordered a retreat to Bataan. Within two days of the Japanese landing at Lingayen Gulf, MacArthur had reverted to pre-July 1941 plan of attempting to hold only Bataan while waiting for a relief force to come. Most of the American and some of the Filipino troops were able to retreat back to Baatan, but without most of their supplies, which were abandoned in the confusion. Manila was declared an open city at midnight on 24 December, without any consultation with Admiral Thomas C. Hart, commanding the Asiatic Fleet, forcing the Navy to destroy considerable amounts of <b>valuable</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} lightly damaged by saboteurs in December which {{disrupted}} progress and the Regia Marina decided to suspend construction in April 1942 as she remained {{nearly two years}} from completion. By late 1942, the Regia Marinas shortage of destroyers had reached a point that every possible hull was needed and construction restarted at a high priority. This allowed her to be launched on 18 July 1943, but shortly afterwards {{a change in the}} Italian leadership caused any further work to be suspended in August and the resources used in her construction to be diverted to finish a large group of small wooden minesweepers. During the fighting between the Germans and the Italians after the Italian surrender on 9 September, Spalato was scuttled in Split harbor on 24 September. The Germans occupied Split three days later, refloated the ship several weeks later and stripped her of any <b>valuable</b> <b>material.</b> As part of their scorched-earth strategy as they abandoned Split, the Germans scuttled Spalato and wrecked the shipyard before the Yugoslav Partisans occupied the port on 27 October 1944.|$|E

In chapter 33, likewise, are found his personal opinions regarding the proper terms of cancellation of such contracts. These chapters are most timely and will be read with interest by professional accountants and contractors.|$|E
25|$|In 1520 the caravels began {{delivering}} Spanish cacao to Spain and {{the pirates}} {{with a letter}} of marque from England, perhaps due to ignorance of the new ingredient, burned and discarded {{the contents of the}} Spanish ships which they seized. No one knows for certain when cocoa first arrived in Spain, however it was considered a <b>valuable</b> <b>material</b> in the mid-16th century. The value which the product had {{can be seen in the}} strength of the Spanish galleons which carried the first cacao seeds to Spanish ports to prevent their theft.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatise}} {{is divided}} into 14 chapters, and this division dates from the 13th century at the latest, since even Mordecai ben Hillel cites it by chapters (Mordekai on M.

The tractate contains almost complete instructions as {{to the treatment of}} the dying and the dead, from the commencement of the death-agony to the arrangement of the grave which receives the remains. Numerous examples from current practice are cited. A large number of haggadot also are included. On the whole, it furnishes much <b>valuable</b> <b>material</b> for the study of Oriental antiquities in general and of ancient Jewish practices in particular, for the verification of historical facts, and for an understanding of the development of Jewish customs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Solar {{power is}} {{one of the fastest growing}} sources of {{renewable}} power in the world today. The word “photovoltaic ” is a combination of two words “photo”, meaning light, and “voltaic”, meaning electricity. Therefore photovoltaic technology, the scientific term used to describe solar energy, involves the generation of electricity from light. During the last years rapidly increased the number of photovoltaic sources in Slovak republic. By the increasing numbers of photovoltaic sources also increased the numbers of installed photovoltaic panels in Slovak republic. Photovoltaic panels contents <b>valuable</b> <b>materials.</b> These <b>valuable</b> <b>materials</b> will become interesting at the life end of photovoltaic panels [8]...|$|R

500|$|When Hong Kong {{announced}} {{the destruction of}} its stockpile, it noted [...] "the management burden and the security risk" [...] inherent {{in the possession of}} large quantities of <b>valuable</b> <b>material.</b> For example, when the Philippines decided to burn its stockpile, only a fraction of what it had confiscated over the years remained, with at least six tons [...] "lost" [...] or stolen during the 2000s alone. Stockpiles of ivory have often been connected to theft and corruption, with multiple countries, including Zambia, Mozambique, Botswana, and the Philippines, suffering [...] "losses" [...] of several tons. Keeping illicit goods on hand can also signal government plans or active involvement with the ivory trade. Destroying it removes the possibility of corruption as well as the costs associated with operating a secure place of storage.|$|E

500|$|The Marble Hall is the {{basement}} of Mt. St. Peter's and is [...] Before the church had been completed, this area had been filled with <b>valuable</b> <b>material</b> from the Mellon Mansion until the materials found their proper places in the upstairs of the church. By winter of 1944, {{the basement}} was completely empty. During this time, there were men working on building the Rectory, but since there was much snow, they could not return to their work on the Rectory until spring. Nicholas Givens had donated a large quantity of marble for the basement, so they began work on the basement. The workers covered the ground with black asphalt tile and the walls and pillars with white Carrara marble. Two marble altars were constructed along with a large kitchen built to feed up to 400people. They also built a furnace room and a large workshop {{to the side of}} the kitchen.|$|E
500|$|The {{second major}} German {{locality}} with P.engelhardti finds, a quarry in Trossingen in the Black Forest, was worked {{repeatedly in the}} 20th century. Between 1911 and 1932, excavations during six field seasons led by German palaeontologists Eberhard Fraas (1911–1912), Friedrich von Huene (1921–23), and finally Reinhold Seemann (1932) revealed a total of 35 complete or partially complete skeletons of Plateosaurus, as well as fragmentary remains of approximately 70 more individuals. The large number of specimens from Swabia had already caused German palaeontologist Friedrich August von Quenstedt to nickname the animal Schwäbischer Lindwurm (Swabian lindworm or Swabian dragon). Much of the Trossingen material was destroyed in 1944, when the Naturaliensammlung in Stuttgart (predecessor to the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart (SMNS)) burnt to the ground after an Allied bombing raid. Luckily, however, a 2011 study by SMNS curator Rainer Schoch found that, {{at least from the}} finds of Seemann's 1932 excavation, [...] "the scientifically most <b>valuable</b> <b>material</b> is still available".|$|E

Being at that time an SA-Sturmbannführer health worker, a report {{confirmed}} that Rodenberg had been a long-time informant for the Sicherheitsdienst (SD). The report shows that Rodenberg had [...] "provided the SD with <b>valuable</b> <b>material</b> on many occasions" [...] and [...] "in his work for the SD he has great interest. His placement in the SS [...] is therefore important." [...] In the SS, Rodenberg was promoted on 30 January 1944 to SS-Obersturmbannführer.

[...] This is an extreme weakness of filters, something that will probably be used in arguments against them until, and if, new technology is developed that is able to define and deem what is “obscene” and what is not.|$|E
