Studies {{have demonstrated that}} Astraeus, Pisolithus, and Scleroderma form ectomycorrhizal associations with both angiosperms and gymnosperms. Previously thought to be saprophytic, the Calostomataceae were determined to be ectomycorrhizal with Fagaceae and Myrtaceae using isotopic and molecular analyses. Species from the genera Pisolithus and Scleroderma {{have been used in}} forestry as mycorrhizal inocula to help promote the growth and <b>vigor</b> <b>of</b> young seedlings.|$|E
5|$|The LaSalle Street {{canyon is}} home to other {{historic}} buildings including the Rookery Building, a National Historic Landmark {{considered to be the}} oldest standing high-rise. A 1907 renovation included a lobby remodeled by Frank Lloyd Wright in the Prairie School style. The name rookery comes from the previous building on the property which became home to many birds, especially pigeons. The nearby Reliance Building was the first skyscraper to have large plate glass windows comprise the majority of its surface area, and One North LaSalle was for some time one of Chicago's tallest buildings. Both the Reliance Building and One North LaSalle are on the National Register of Historic Places. Since 1853, the governments of Chicago and Cook County have shared three different buildings {{at the north end of}} the canyon. The current Chicago City Hall, built in a Classical Revival style, was designed to symbolize the strength, dignity, and <b>vigor</b> <b>of</b> the government. Completed in 2001, an award-winning green roof was incorporated into the structure. All of the structures are designated as Chicago Landmarks.|$|E

25|$|Several {{nematode}} species infect rice crops, causing {{diseases such}} as Ufra (Ditylenchus dipsaci), White tip disease (Aphelenchoide bessei), and root knot disease (Meloidogyne graminicola). Some nematode species such as Pratylenchus spp. are most dangerous in upland rice of {{all parts of the}} world. Rice root nematode (Hirschmanniella oryzae) is a migratory endoparasite which on higher inoculum levels will lead to complete destruction of a rice crop. Beyond being obligate parasites, they also decrease the <b>vigor</b> <b>of</b> plants and increase the plants' susceptibility to other pests and diseases.|$|E

A similar system was introduced at Wesleyan University in nearby Middletown, Connecticut, but with a pair of societies in each class year and dual memberships between class societies and college fraternities, so that most class society members were also fraternity members. The older societies survived because of their endowments, real estate, and the <b>vigor</b> <b>of</b> their respective alumni organizations and their charitable Trusts.|$|E
25|$|Current mime therapy {{consists}} {{of a combination of}} procedures designed to promote symmetry of the face at rest and during movement to control synkinesis. The components include: massage, stretching exercises, exercises to coordinate both halves of the face, etc. The overall aim of mime therapy is to develop a conscious connection between the use of facial muscles and emotional expression. While facial retraining therapy is more focused on treating slight synkinetic movements, mime therapy aims to increase the overall <b>vigor</b> <b>of</b> the muscles through active exercises, while {{in the process of doing}} so, teaching the face to decrease unwanted synkinetic movements.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, {{investments}} {{made possible the}} use of irrigation, especially in the Northeast Region and in Rio Grande do Sul State, which had shifted from grazing to soy and rice production in the 1970s. Savanna soils also were made usable for soybean farming through acidity correction, fertilization, plant breeding, {{and in some cases}} spray irrigation. As agriculture underwent modernization in the 1970s and 1980s, soil fertility became less important for agricultural production than factors related to capital investment, such as infrastructure, mechanization, use of chemical inputs, breeding, and proximity to markets. Consequently, the <b>vigor</b> <b>of</b> frontier expansion weakened.|$|E

25|$|Soils {{with low}} {{fertility}} are ideal and help control {{some of the}} <b>vigor</b> <b>of</b> the vine.

While high-yielding clones have been favored in the past, more attention is being paid to matching the clone to the vineyard site and controlling the vine's vigor.|$|E
25|$|In 2000 and 2001, Merck {{conducted}} {{several studies}} of rofecoxib aimed at determining if the drug slowed {{the onset of}} Alzheimer's disease. Merck has placed great emphasis on these studies {{on the grounds that}} they are relatively large (almost 3000 patients) and compared rofecoxib to a placebo rather than to another pain reliever. These studies found an elevated death rate among rofecoxib patients, although the deaths were not generally heart-related. However, they did not find any elevated cardiovascular risk due to rofecoxib. Before 2004, Merck cited these studies as providing evidence, contrary to <b>VIGOR,</b> <b>of</b> rofecoxib's safety.|$|E

The settlement frontier quickly moved {{north along the}} Brazos, Colorado, and Guadalupe rivers, into Comanche hunting ranges and the borders of Comancheria. Soon the Texan-Comanche relationship was turning violent. Houston made efforts to restore peace and the Comanches, alarmed at the <b>vigor</b> <b>of</b> Texan settlement, began to consider demanding a fixed boundary, contrary to their traditional notions about borders. However, Houston was forbidden by Texas law to yield any land claimed by the Republic. He still made peace with the Comanche in 1838.|$|E

Edith initially did not pursue the furtherance of their physical interaction with the <b>vigor</b> <b>of</b> Wilson, but she gradually warmed to the relationship and they became secretly engaged {{in the fall of}} 1915. Many in Wilson's camp had become concerned about the appearance of a premature romance soon {{after the death of his}} wife; the engagement was made public in October and they were married on December 18, 1915.

25|$|Considering {{that the}} writing of the general {{newspaper}} worker was for the most part anonymous, the organization felt that its ranks do not appear at a disadvantage when compared with those of other press associations. the PCWPA's population was so scattered over a large territory, that it could not show many influential Western newspaper connections. On the other hand, the Western <b>vigor</b> <b>of</b> style had become popular, with nearly all of the writers retaining from one to a half a dozen connections with influential Eastern and English periodicals. As a member of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, the International League of Press Clubs and the Woman's National Press Association, the PCWPA was abreast with the spirit of organization, at the same time confident that responsible individualism was the basis of strength.|$|E

25|$|Bonsai {{cultivation}} {{and care}} involves the long-term cultivation of small trees in containers, called bonsai in the Japanese tradition of this art form. Similar practices exist in other Japanese art forms {{and in other}} cultures, including saikei (Japanese), penjing (Chinese), and hòn non bộ (Vietnamese). Trees are difficult to cultivate in containers, which restrict root growth, nutrition uptake, and resources for transpiration (primarily soil moisture). In addition to the root constraints of containers, bonsai trunks, branches, and foliage are extensively shaped and manipulated to meet aesthetic goals. Specialized tools and techniques are used to protect the health and <b>vigor</b> <b>of</b> the subject tree. Over time, the artistic manipulation of small trees in containers {{has led to a}} number of cultivation and care approaches that successfully meet the practical and the artistic requirements of bonsai and similar traditions.|$|E
