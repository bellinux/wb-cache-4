50|$|VDP is {{a direct}} {{outgrowth}} of digital printing, which harnesses computer databases and digital print devices and highly effective software to create high-quality, full color documents, with a look and feel comparable to conventional offset printing. <b>Variable</b> <b>data</b> <b>printing</b> enables the mass customization of documents via digital print technology, {{as opposed to the}} 'mass-production' of a single document using offset lithography. Instead of producing 10,000 copies of a single document, delivering a single message to 10,000 customers, <b>variable</b> <b>data</b> <b>printing</b> could print 10,000 unique documents with customized messages for each customer.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} {{technology}} to help differentiate originals from copies is the void pantograph. Void pantographs are essentially {{invisible to the}} untrained, naked eye on an original but when scanned or copied the layout of lines, dots and dashes will reveal a word (frequently VOID and hence the name) or symbol that clearly allows the copy to be identified. This technology is available on both traditional presses (offset and flexographic) and on the newer digital platforms. The advantage of a digital press {{is that in a}} single pass through the printer a void pantograph with all the <b>variable</b> <b>data</b> can be <b>printed</b> on plain paper.|$|R

30|$|Wideband code {{division}} multiple access (WCDMA) cellular networks use a CDMA scheme known as OVSF-CDMA [4] to support <b>variable</b> <b>data</b> rates by employing orthogonal variable spreading factor (OVSF) codes. In an OVSF-CDMA-based system, each mobile station is assigned a single OVSF code. <b>Variable</b> <b>data</b> rates are supported by changing the spreading factor (SF). An alternative CDMA scheme known as multicode CDMA (MC-CDMA) [5] assigns multiple codes of the same spreading factor to a mobile station in order to achieve <b>variable</b> <b>data</b> rates. MC-CDMA requires multiple transceivers to support <b>variable</b> <b>data</b> rates. OVSF-CDMA reduces the hardware complexity of the mobile station because it requires only a single transceiver to support <b>variable</b> <b>data</b> rates. However, OVSF-CDMA suffers from the code blocking problem, as explained next.|$|R

40|$|Historically, {{calibration}} {{results have}} typically been recorded {{and stored in}} the form of attributes data. In the past few years, however, an apparent trend has begun to emerge for recording and storing calibration results {{in the form of}} <b>variables</b> <b>data.</b> This is partly due to ISO/IEC 17025 requirements for uncertainty analysis and partly due to the growing implementation of six-sigma or other SPC quality control systems. The growing availability of <b>variables</b> <b>data</b> has positive implications for calibration interval analysis. This paper describes a methodology for determining calibration intervals from <b>variables</b> <b>data.</b> A regression analysis analytical approach is developed and algorithms are given for setting parameter calibration intervals from the results of <b>variables</b> <b>data</b> analysis. ...|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} levels of {{variable}} printing. The {{most basic level}} involves changing the salutation or name on each copy much like mail merge. More complicated <b>variable</b> <b>data</b> <b>printing</b> uses 'versioning', where there may be differing amounts of customization for different markets, with text and images changing for groups of addresses based upon which segment of the market is being addressed. Finally there is full variability printing, where the text and images can be altered for each individual address. All <b>variable</b> <b>data</b> <b>printing</b> begins with a basic design that defines static elements and variable fields for the pieces to be printed. While the static elements appear exactly the same on each piece, the variable fields are filled in with text or images as dictated {{by a set of}} application and style rules and the information contained in the database.|$|E

Whenever we deal with <b>variables</b> <b>data,</b> we usually employ a combination of X-bar chart and R chart (or S chart) to monitor both the center and the spread of the process. In this paper, we propose a simple alternative, that is, we design a single chart to monitor both the center and the spread for <b>variables</b> <b>data.</b> When compared with the combination of X-bar chart and S chart, the proposed chart is shown to be just as effective. An example is given to show how to use this new chart. Key words and phrases: Average run length, control chart, <b>variables</b> <b>data.</b> 1...|$|R
