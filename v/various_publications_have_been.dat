Taxes on oil production and exports are the most important source of state budget revenues which guarantee Russia maintains its political and economic stability. Russia is building its international position {{on the basis of its}} vast raw material and energy potential. While a great number of <b>various</b> <b>publications</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> devoted to Russian gas and Gazprom, surprisingly little research has been done into the present condition and possible future developments of the Russian oil sector, despite the fact that oil has and will have a much greater impact than gas on the functioning and the future of Russia. The main objective of this text is to describe the present situation of the Russian oil sector, its problems and the challenges it is posing, as well as the government’s policy towards this key branch of the Russian economy. This will be an introduction to an attempt to answer to the questions about the possible future production and the export levels of Russian oil, also broken down into the European and Asian directions...|$|E
40|$|Recent state: The {{umbilical}} cord care {{is one of}} the basic operations which are made immediately after the childbirth and during the first weeks in the newborn?s life. It is an everyday routine of midwives, infant nurses and mothers. The {{umbilical cord}} care is very important as the cord stump can easily become a gateway for an infection and hereby endanger the newborn?s health and life. Many pages in <b>various</b> <b>publications</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> written about the way how to treat the umbilicus. The authors wrote mostly about their own experience and the possibilities which they had in their time. Considering that the procedure changed several times in the past years, there is no unity in the way how to proceed in unison and the newborn?s umbilical cord care is performed differently in diverse hospitals. Repeated education of mothers about correct umbilical cord care in hospital as well as at home is also necessary. World Health Organisation (WHO), The Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN), European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and in the Czech Republic The Czech Neonatology Organisation (ČSNeoS) deal with the issue of the umbilical cord care. Subject: The aim of the work was to find out {{the way in which the}} umbilical cord care in newborns from birth to the discharge to home care is performed in chosen infant wards and the way the mothers are educated about the umbilical cord care in chosen infant wards. Methodology: The practical part of the work was compiled on the basis of qualitative survey with a small set of respondents. The qualitative survey was made in a form of questioning and the technique of depth interview was used for the data collecting. This method was chosen because it helps to keep the content aspect of the interview and at the same time it provides space to the respondents to express their own opinions, feelings and experience about the subject of the interview. It also enables to see how the respondents understand the particular problem. The subsequent coding, categorization and content analysis of interviews was made easier thanks to the uniform composition of questions. Research set: The research set was assembled from three infant nurses/midwives and three mothers in purposely chosen infant wards in Valašské Meziříčí, Benešov and České Budějovice. Three criteria were set for choosing of the infant nurses/midwives. The first criterion was work in an infant ward without technical supervision (valid registration of the nurse in NCONZO), the second one was employment for at least one year in an infant ward and the third one was a visible identification of person. Two criteria were set for choosing of the mothers. The first criterion was mother?s newborn care in the form of rooming-in for at least 48 hours and the second one was that the mother and the newborn will be discharged to home care on the day of interview. Results : From the result of the research it is clear that the way of the newborn umbilical cord care in chosen infant wards differs in the umbilical cord care after the birth as well as in the subsequent care provided in the rooming-in care. The standard of the umbilical cord care in infant wards are set by the consultant and the head doctor of the ward and basically do not change, only in České Budějovice there was one change last year, when they accepted the latest AWHONN recommendation from 2007 which says that the cord stump should be left to fall off spontaneously. It follows that the infant ward in České Budějovice matches the WHO, AWHONN and ČNeoS recommendation the most, the infant ward in Benešov slightly differs in the procedure and the infant ward in Valašské Meziříčí treats the umbilical cord according the old standard of ČNeoS. Conclusion: The output of the work is a standard of nursing care in the newborn umbilical cord care which could serve as a uniform procedure in chosen infant wards...|$|E

The pH of the venous blood of certain fresh water fishes, under experimental conditions, as determined by the Beckman pH meter glass electrode was fairly constant, pH 6. 20 to 7. 07 over a wide range of carbon dioxide tensions, approximately. 09 to 20 mm.

The pH level of the blood in the species of fishes tested, rock bass {Ambloplites rupestris), small mouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens), in the experiments just cited, is maintained by a modification of the alkali reserve of the blood either up or down.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, {{corporate}} responsibility issues, including the social obligations of corporations, have attained prominence in political and business debate. This {{is not only}} in response to corporate scandals but also due {{to the realization that}} development centered only on economic growth paradigms is unsustainable and therefore,there is a need for a more proactive role by states, companies and communities in a development process aimed at balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability and social cohesion. The concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is gaining importance nowadays. It calls upon business to follow ethical practices while dealing with shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, environment, government and community, all the companies are not equally committed towards their social responsibility. When everything seems to be going wrong, it is the employees that can make company realize their social responsibility.

40|$|Since {{the turn}} of the {{millennium}} <b>various</b> scientific <b>publications</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> discussing a re-greening of the Sahel after the 1980 s drought mainly based on coarse-resolution satellite data. However, the author's own field studies suggest that the situation is far more complex and that both paradigms, the encroaching Sahara and the re-greening Sahel, need to be questioned. This paper discusses the concepts of desertification, resilience, and re-greening by addressing four main aspects: (i)  the relevance of edaphic factors for a vegetation re-greening, (ii-iii)  the importance of the selected observation period in the debate on Sahel greening or browning, and (iv)  modifications in the vegetation pattern as possible indicators of ecosystem changes (shift from originally diffuse to contracted vegetation patterns). The data referred to in this paper cover a time period of more than 150 years and include the author's own research results from the early 1980 s until today. A special emphasis, apart from fieldwork data and remote sensing data, is laid on the historical documents. The key findings summarised at the end show the following: (i)  vegetation recovery predominantly depends on soil types; (ii)  when discussing Sahel greening vs. Sahel browning, the majority of research papers only focus on post-drought conditions. Taking pre-drought conditions (before the 1980 s) into account, however, is essential to fully understand the situation. Botanical investigations and remote-sensing-based time series clearly show a substantial decline in woody species diversity and cover density compared to pre-drought conditions; (iii) the self-organised patchiness of vegetation is considered to be an important indicator of ecosystem changes...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate whether there is sufficient economic justification of the omission of nuclear energy from the policy sphere in New Zealand. Technologically speaking nuclear is a reliable and clean source of electricity, but concerns surround its safety and cost competitiveness. In order to reach a relevant conclusion, a range of literature, scientific reports, cost data, and other <b>various</b> institutional <b>publications</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> evaluated. Consideration is also made of the political treatment of nuclear technology, with the understanding that nuclear power needs to gain acceptance {{in the eyes of the}} public and policymakers, not just prove economically competitive. The findings of the research are two-fold. First, nuclear power is potentially economically competitive – when carbon cost estimations are taken into account. In the absence of any adjustments for emissions, the outcome is less clear. Nevertheless, this is promising in the case of New Zealand, which has a carbon trading scheme and a strong focus on emissions costs in its energy outlook. Secondly, the safety risks of a modern nuclear energy are not nearly as drastic as public perception may hold. The oftquoted examples of Chernobyl and Three Mile Island are – in the case of a modern reactor design – irrelevant and encouraging, respectively. However, the findings also point to on-going challenges facing nuclear energy, particularly that of long-term waste disposal. The author asserts that, on balance, there is no justification for simply dismissing nuclear as an energy option. Further research and an integration of the technology into the evaluation of possible future electric generation mixes would be desirable, in order to reach a definitive conclusion about the possible role of nuclear generation in the NZ energy sector...|$|R

In nature, association of the two domains is assisted through a combination of metal ions (including Mg2+) and the presence of two additional helical domains that are not present in the minimal ribozyme-substrate complex but serve to promote proper three-dimensional folding. These additional domains stack upon helices 2 and 3, thereby promoting the association of the two functional domains through what is termed a four-way helical junction.|$|R

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comInternational audienceMelt generation and extraction are typically modeled using the two-phase equations developed by mckenzie: 1984 or scott: 1984. Various approximations are often made to simplify the problem which may lead to some unphysical results (, thermodynamically inconsistent conditions of melting and unrealistic porosity profiles). Here, we discuss a generalized version of the set of equations introduced by BRS 1 that allows for mass transfer between the two phases and consider a self-consistent set of equations. In our description the two phases are submitted to individual pressure fields whose difference {{is related to the}} surface tension at the interfaces, changes in porosity and the melting rate. A kinetic relation for the melting rate arises from the second law of thermodynamics. The condition of chemical equilibrium corresponds to the usual univariant equality of the chemical potentials of each phase when the matrix and melt are motionless. In the most general form, phase equilibrium is influenced by both the Gibbs-Thomson effect that arises naturally from thermodynamic considerations on surface tension and by the viscous deformation of the phases. We apply these new equations to a steady state problem of pressure release melting in a univariant system. We treat melting and compaction simultaneously and observe several new effects including multiple boundary layers near the onset of melting that correspond to various force balances. A consequence of matrix compaction and melt expulsion (or matrix dilation and melt accumulation) is a pressure difference between melt and solid that facilitates (inhibits) melting. For parameters corresponding to mid-oceanic ridge magmatism, compaction induces melting to start as much as ∼ 2 km below the standard solidus. Numerical solutions are necessary to determine the magnitude of the melt zone shift. Numerical results support the boundary layer solutions obtained analytically and suggest that in most of the melting zone the movement of melt and matrix should be close to the Darcy equilibrium where the buoyancy of melt is balanced by the viscous drag between the phases. The Darcy equilibrium follows an initial stage where the matrix viscous stresses balance Darcy drag. In all situations the steady state porosity profile remains a monotonous function of depth. The existence of a compaction layer following a melting zone where the porosity is maximum as described in <b>various</b> earlier <b>publications</b> <b>has</b> never <b>been</b> found...|$|R

40|$|This special theme {{issue of}} the International Journal of Pedagogies and Learning is {{entitled}} "Town and Gown' in the Bush: Contemporary Regional Universities and Transforming Communities' and provides a forum for multiple engagements with the relationships (or lack thereof) between contemporary regional universities and their communities, whether in Australia or in other countries. Many of the world's most prestigious universities, such as Oxford, Cambridge, Heidelberg and Yale, are located in regional settings. Indeed in some cases, such as Utrecht, the regional town has developed around the university. Certainly, owing to the concentration of academics and students within a relatively underpopulated location, the atmosphere within a regional university town seems to be quite distinctive. Such an atmosphere <b>has</b> not always <b>been</b> mutually fruitful, {{and there is a}} long history of distrust between the university and the town of which it is ostensibly a part. In the case of Oxford, tensions between townspeople, who resented the university's growing arrogance and authority, and students boiled over on 10 February 1354, the Feast of Scholastica: 'The countrymen advanced crying [...] . 'Smyt fast, give gude knocks' [...] Such Scholars as they found [...] . they killed or maimed, or grievously wounded [...] Our mother the University of Oxon, which had but two days before many sons is now almost forsaken and left forlorn' (Anthony Wood, History and Antiquities of the University of Oxford, 1674; cited in Drake 1991, p. 3). The battle led to 62 students being killed and the rest being driven from the town. In the case of Australia, most of the longstanding traditional universities were constructed within metropolitan centres and capital cities. One exception is the University of New England in Armidale. Indeed, up until the 1980 s, higher education institutions in most country areas were limited to Technical and Further Education (TAFE) colleges and colleges of advanced education (CAEs). The reforms by John Dawkins, the then Federal Minister for Employment, Education and Training, to higher education in that decade saw these CAEs attain the status of universities, a change that enabled them to award postgraduate degrees and be recognised for research. Colloquially known as 'gumnut universities', these regional campuses have faced ongoing challenges in recruiting and retaining students and academics, building a competitive research profile and finding a secure niche within the Australian higher education field {{on the one hand and}} within the often culturally diverse and geographically dispersed regional communities from which they draw their allegiance on the other. While several discourses can be discerned in these relationships, commentators on regional universities and communities commonly invoke at least two distinct narratives:  Regional universities, like their communities, are marginalised and under threat, and their best chance for survival lies in working together to create alternative opportunities and futures.  Regional universities, like their metropolitan counterparts, must increasingly adopt free market ideologies and practices whereby regional communities will be sidelined unless they can compete with national and international clients in accessing services from 'their' universities. In interrogating, contesting and reconstructing these discourses, the authors of the articles in this issue address three key questions currently confronting regional universities and their communities:  What are the identities and the missions of contemporary regional universities?  How are those identities and missions manifested in the universities' negotiated relationships with their communities, only some of which might also be regional?  What are the implications of those relationships for the likely future sustainability and survival of both regional universities and communities? In seeking to address these questions, the issue is also directed at re-examining the concept of 'transformations' in regional communities in the early 21 st century. Transformations, understood as permanent and substantial changes and improvements, are crucial for the ongoing development of individuals and groups. Yet often these transformations occur in spite of, not because of, the planned interventions of institutions. So it is vital, now more than ever before, to understand the drivers, influences and potential outcomes of and on genuinely meaningful and productive transformations in regional communities. Within that quest for understanding, a process of evaluating the roles and responsibilities of regional universities and communities with regard to themselves and to one another is a worthwhile endeavour. At this point we need to offer an important explanatory note. The articles that comprise this volume were largely composed in 2004. Owing to <b>various</b> constraints <b>publication</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> delayed until 2006. Despite this delay, we believe that the approaches outlined and issues canvassed within the articles offer an enriching understanding of the relationships between town and gown within regional settings...|$|R
