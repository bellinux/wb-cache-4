40|$|Abstract. The {{air-conditioning}} {{system is a}} source of energy consumption and consequently, it has a strong influence on the fuel consumption, the engine load and the pollutant emissions. The {{air-conditioning system}} has to be accounted for in the energy balance under the hood. This system is composed of a <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>compressor</b> including an internal regulation valve. In this paper, we model a complete system step by step. We build the compressor system and gradually add components so as to end up with the complete system. The simulation results shows that when the suction pressure becomes at some point smaller than the regulation pressure, the valve controls the compressor displacement and tends to reduce it in order to maintain a certain level for the suction pressure. It will be easier to observe the influence of the regulation valve on the complete refrigerant loop system...|$|E

A vibration mount installed between the flywheel and crankshaft {{is used as}} the optimizing element; the stiffness and damping values of the mount are selected so that the shaft vibration level is min-imized over the cruise speed range, while the maximum twist angle acceleration amplitude and transmitted torque are kept within acceptable limits for the entire operating speed range. An asymptotic analysis is used to obtain the nonlinear vibrational response. This analysis provides analytic expressions for the motion and forces {{in terms of the}} operating speed and other geometric, kinetic, and dynamic parameters. Consequently, the calculation of the objective and constraint functions is simple to do. A result of the analysis is that the optimal design is insensitive to changes in the magnitude and shape of the cylinder pressure excitation...|$|E

The massive energy consumption of AC&R systems provides both economic and environmental motivation to develop highly efficient systems that maintain operating efficiency through the use of online diagnostic modules. Recent developments in actuator technologies (i. e. variable speed and <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>compressors,</b> electronic expansion valves) managed by proper control architectures can capitalize on the efficiency gains obtained through continuous system operation, enabling significant efficiency gains to be realized in vapor compression systems. The addition of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) algorithms to the overall control architecture provides the capability to maintain a high level of system performance over its lifetime of operation. This thesis makes contributions to both the effective transient control and diagnostic capability of vapor compression systems. Accurate control-oriented models that balance simplicity and accuracy are leveraged to improve the understanding of system level fault impact. The general control architecture for vapor compression systems is analyzed from a design perspective, and effective methods to achieve improved system performance and capacity control are demonstrated.

To validate the system model, a test system is established and the simulated results are compared with experimental data: the predicted results agree well with the experimental data. After analyzing the influence of different factors with the system model, three reasons causing evaporator frosting have been found and corresponding countermeasures have been proposed: (1) the system performance band caused by the frictional forces among the moving components of the VDC can contribute to evaporator frosting, which may be avoided by decreasing the frictional forces between the moving components while designing, manufacturing and operating the VDC; (2) the mismatch between the parameters of the control valve and the resistance pressure of suction pipe or the condenser size can also contribute to evaporator frosting and the control valve with a proper initial compressive force should be selected for a given suction pipe and condenser; and (3) a higher air temperature at the condenser's inlet may cause evaporator frosting one needs to consider the influence of the air temperature at the condenser inlet while designing the new control valve.

40|$|The {{use of a}} roof-top Bus {{air-conditioning}} (AC) {{system has}} been steadily growing in in the emerging markets. An AC system is the second biggest energy consumer component in a bus. The addition of an air conditioning system in a bus would cause higher fossil fuel consumption and increasing {{the impact on the}} environment due to the increasing amounts of exhaust emission from the combustion engines. For this reason, researchers and AC system manufacturers seek to improve Bus AC systems design and technology to reduce the fuel consumption rate without forfeiting passenger thermal comfort. Unlike in Developed Markets,Bus AC in Emerging Markets pose a unique challenge of undersigned Main engine, not well insulated walls and higher emphasis on first cost. Thus, {{there is a need to}} develop an affordable and efficient bus AC system featured by low first cost, economical operation in terms of energy saving and stable passenger thermal comfort at all atmospheric conditions. This paper presents a design optimization study that is used in assessing the best configuration of a bus air conditioning system, using a thermo economic approach. A cost function is introduced, defined as the sum of three contributions, the efficiency of system obtained by minimizing the rate of exergy destruction, the investment expense, and the operational expense of a roof top Bus AC system that is usually coupled with the main bus engine. The optimal trade-off between these contributions efficiency, investment and operating cost is investigated. The design optimization is conducted by investigating the effect of geometrical and operational parameters of system configuration which have a significant influence on the objective functions of the design optimization. Based on this sensitivity analysis different practical system enhancement methods like using <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>compressors,</b> enhanced and demand based dehumidification, dedicated sub cooling etc are investigated to minimize the cost function.

40|$|The ECS and the {{anti-ice}} {{systems are}} two of the energy consumers for an aircraft; they absorb together two times the sum of the power of all the other systems (electrical, mechanical and hydraulic). More efficient ECSs and a more efficient anti-ice sub-systems would reduce the aircraft fuel consumption increasing the operative radius of the vehicle and also increasing the maximum useful load. The anti-ice sub-system is not only a key energy consumer {{but it is also a}} system critical for the flight safety: a failure of this system means a mission abort and the landing on the nearest airport. This thesis presents the results of several mathematical models which have been developed to study the performance of the aforementioned systems and the strategies to reduce their impacts on the aircraft fuel consumption. The models have been developed using AMEsim and Simulink. In particular a mathematical model, which describes the behavior of the inline pneumatic valves, have been created. The model uses the fundamental thermodynamic and mechanical differential equations to simulate the dynamic behavior of the valves. The mathematical model reproduces the results of the experimental tests within their uncertainty. The validated model has been used to explore the behavior of the valve and its own subcomponents proposing two possible solutions to increase the operative range of the valves and to decrease the influence of the pressure and temperature on the regulated pressure. The second detailed mathematical model created calculates the performance of the plate and wavy fins compact heat exchangers. The model, based on the work of Kays & London, includes some improvements related to the description heat exchanger geometry and related to the empirical correlations used to calculate the number of Stanton. The tests performed on three different heat exchangers have been used to validated the developed model; the mathematical model is able to predict the performance of the performance of the HXs with an accuracy compatible with most the industrial applications. The developed detailed models have been used to simulate the behavior of the system where they are installed. The behavior of an anti-ice system at extreme high bleed air temperature has been analyzed. An innovative architecture for anti-ice system is studied and the benefits on aircraft fuel consumption for a standard day mission are shown. The performance of an reverse Brayton-Joule cycle has been analyzed and a new possible control strategy based on a line installed in series to the air cycle machine is proposed. The limits of the proposed architecture are exposed studying the case of a system used to cool some electronic equipment. The benefits of the use of a reverse Brayton-Joule system which does not use the air bled from the engine (bleedless approach) are detailed with particular attention to the gain in terms of fuel penalty.
