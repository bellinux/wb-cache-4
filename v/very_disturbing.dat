500|$|Kondracki's graphic {{depiction}} of violence was controversial. Bob Mondello of NPR called it [...] "sobering", but felt the scenes detracted {{from the film}} {{and should have been}} more subtle. Ryan Rojas of Tonight at the Movies described the film as [...] "gritty and merciless", and cautioned that certain scenes might offend some viewers: [...] "While the scenes do work as reinforcing the horror of the events, it really just made it obvious that the way that the director was going to win over fans was to simply shock them into numbness, as scenes showing rape, mutilation, and murder are shown in <b>very</b> <b>disturbing</b> fashion."

500|$|According to Stephen Dillon, Lynch's use of {{different}} camera positions throughout the film, such as hand-held points of view, makes the viewer [...] "identify with the suspense {{of the character}} {{in his or her}} particular space", but that Lynch at moments also [...] "disconnects the camera from any particular point of view, thereby ungrounding a single or even a human perspective" [...] so that the multiple perspectives keep contexts from merging, significantly troubling [...] "our sense of the individual and the human". Andrew Hageman similarly notes that the camera work in the film [...] "renders a <b>very</b> <b>disturbing</b> sense of place and presence", such as the scene in Winkie's where the [...] "camera floats irregularly during the shot-reverse shot dialogue" [...] by which the [...] "spectator becomes aware that a set of normally objective shots have become disturbingly subjective". Scholar Curt Hersey recognizes several avant-garde techniques used in the film including lack of transitions, abrupt transitions, motion speed, nontraditional camera movement, computer-generated imagery, nondiegetic images, nonlinear narration and intertextuality.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of November, President Johnson announced that a bombing had been halted in Vietnam; observers noted that the development significantly helped Humphrey although Nixon had endorsed such talks. At this time, Nixon operative Anna Chennault secretly spoke with the South Vietnamese, explaining that they could receive a better deal under Nixon. The charge that, along with remarks from Nixon supporter and future Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, Johnson had deliberately misinformed Nixon during briefs angered the President. He spoke with Nixon supporters Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen and Senator George Smathers of Florida, informing Nixon of the President's frustration. On the Sunday preceding the election, Nixon appeared on Meet the Press, explaining that he would cooperate completely with Johnson, phoning the President shortly thereafter to personally reassure him. The final Harris poll before the election indicated that Nixon was trailing Humphrey 43% to 40%, but Gallup's final poll showed Nixon leading 42% to 40%. On {{the eve of the}} election, Nixon and Humphrey bought time on rival television networks, Nixon appearing on NBC, Humphrey on ABC, where each made his final appeal to voters. Nixon used this appearance to counter Humphrey's 'October surprise', a polling surge following the bombing halt, claiming that he had just received [...] "a <b>very</b> <b>disturbing</b> report", which detailed that tons of supplies were being moved into South Vietnam by the North. Humphrey labeled this charge as [...] "irresponsible", causing Nixon to counter that Humphrey [...] "doesn't know what's going on." [...] Overall, Nixon spent $6,270,000 on television advertising, most of which was judged to have only reinforced supporters.|$|E
