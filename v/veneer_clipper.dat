40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the largest loss associated with green veneer production occurs at the green <b>veneer</b> <b>clipper.</b> It has been reported that up to 26 percent of the block volume is lost during clipping. However, because of today's processing sophistication, this value is no longer considered current nor was it determined by direct measurement. Therefore, no conclusions could be drawn regarding the overall accuracy of the clipping operation. This project involved the development of a direct measurement technique, whereby the veneer on the downstream side of the clipper was photographed during the peeling and clipping operation. The resulting film images were digitized in the laboratory. Six hundred Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) peeler blocks in four diameter classes ranging on the small end from 10. 00 to 29. 99 in. were obtained from five Pacific Northwest mills for this study. All veneer volumes and resulting recovery values are reported. That component normally designated as trash was partitioned into distinct components and quantified. The green-end performance was further analyzed to determine the amount of potentially recoverable material presently being lost in the clipping stage. The merchantable veneer recovered at the five mills, ranged from 65 percent to 82 percent of the total block volume with veneer recovery factors ranging from 3. 49 to 4. 27. The average total mill loss at the clipper ranged from five percent to ten percent of the total block volume. Merchantable veneer volumes could potentially be improved anywhere from 1. 5 percent to four percent at the clipper. This information could be useful to clipper and scanner manufacturers as well as being of interest to mill management to serve as a reference base regarding the potential for recovery improvement at the green-end...|$|E
