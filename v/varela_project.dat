5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Payá and other MCL activists began {{collecting}} signatures for the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project,</b> a petition drive {{that would become}} his best-known program. Named in honor of Félix Varela, a Catholic priest {{who had participated in}} Cuba's independence struggle with Spain, the Project took advantage of a clause in the Cuban Constitution requiring a national referendum to be held if 11,000 signatures are gathered.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien {{arrived in}} Cuba to meet Castro and {{highlight}} their close ties. He {{was the first}} Canadian government leader to visit the island since Pierre Trudeau was in Havana in 1976. In 2002, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter visited Cuba, where he highlighted the lack of civil liberties {{in the country and}} urged the government {{to pay attention to the}} <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> of Oswaldo Payá.|$|E
5|$|Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas (29 February 1952– 22 July 2012) was a Cuban {{political}} activist. A Roman Catholic, {{he founded}} the Christian Liberation Movement in 1987 to oppose the one-party rule of the Cuban Communist Party. He attracted international attention for organizing a petition drive known as the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project,</b> in which 25,000 signatories petitioned the Cuban government to guarantee {{freedom of speech and}} freedom of assembly as well as to institute a multi-party democracy. In recognition of his work, he received the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize and People in Need's Homo Homini Award.|$|E
50|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} white middle class portrayals in {{literacy}} materials, Varela began creating materials that reflected Black people’s lifestyles. After the notorious Dallas County Sheriff Jim Clark shut the Selma program down by arresting <b>Varela’s</b> <b>project</b> staff, she moved to Mississippi (where she herself was arrested several times) {{and spent the next}} 3 years responding to SNCC organizers’ requests for adult education and training materials.|$|R

5000|$|Grave de Peralta {{was imprisoned}} in 2003 within the Kilo 5½ Prison in Pinar del Río during the Black Spring. He has been {{declared}} as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. Before his imprisonment, he was a multitasking threat to the Castro dictatorship. As {{a member of the}} Christian Liberation Movement, Grave de Peralta collected over 100 signatures for the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project's</b> pro-democracy campaign. He had a circulation record of over 700 book loans despite restrictions on independent libraries. During his time as a prisoner of conscience, he was subjected to ill-treatment such as extended periods of solitary confinement and incarcerating in prisons located at extreme distances from his home, breaking many Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. He received assistance from Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart while incarcerated, who petitioned for his release along with the other political prisoners.|$|R

25|$|The <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> (Proyecto Varela in Spanish) is {{a project}} that was started in 1998 by Oswaldo Payá of the Christian Liberation Movement (CLM) and named after Felix Varela, a Cuban {{religious}} leader.|$|E
25|$|In March 2003, Cuba arrested 75 {{human rights}} activists, {{including}} 25 {{members of the}} <b>Varela</b> <b>Project,</b> {{on a variety of}} charges; all were sentenced to prison in trials within twenty days of their arrest.|$|E
25|$|In March 2003, {{approximately}} 75 dissidents were jailed by the Cuban {{authorities for}} allegedly receiving unlawful payments from the Interests Section. Some {{of these were}} participants in the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project,</b> though the leader of that project, Oswaldo Payá, was careful to stress his distance from the Americans.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> was to {{circulate}} a proposal of law advocating for democratic political reforms within Cuba, such as the establishment of freedom of association, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, free elections, freedom of religion, freedom to start private businesses, and amnesty for political prisoners.|$|E
25|$|Although {{contacts}} between Cubans and foreign visitors were made legal in 1997, extensive censorship has isolated {{it from the}} rest of the world. In 1997, a group led by Vladimiro Roca, a decorated veteran of the Angolan war and the son of the founder of the Cuban Communist Party, sent a petition, entitled La Patria es de Todos ("the homeland belongs to all") to the Cuban general assembly, requesting democratic and human rights reforms. As a result, Roca and his three associates were sentenced to imprisonment, from which they were eventually released. In 2001, a group of Cuban activists collected thousands of signatures for the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project,</b> a petition requesting a referendum on the island's political process, which was openly supported by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter during his 2002 visit to Cuba. The petition gathered sufficient signatures to be considered by the Cuban government, but was rejected on an alleged technicality. Instead, a plebiscite was held in which it was formally proclaimed that Castro's brand of socialism would be perpetual.|$|E
500|$|Later that year, Payá's {{efforts were}} {{recognized}} by the European Parliament, which awarded him its Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, although he was nearly denied an exit visa to attend the awards ceremony. In the months that followed, Payá met with Pope John Paul II, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, and Mexican President Vicente Fox to discuss the cause of Cuban democratic reform. The <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> progress was blocked when the government launched its own petition drive to declare the socialist state [...] "irrevocable". During the 2003 crackdown popularly known as the Black Spring, MCL members comprised around 40 of the 75 defendants, though Payá himself was not arrested.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> {{movement}} enjoyed broad based {{support among}} expatriate Cuban-Americans and the United States Government. [...] Also, {{some of the}} <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> leaders were accused by the Cuban government of accepting foreign political support from James Cason of the United States State Department for political purposes, which {{is against the law}} in Cuba. The dissidents deny the charges. In March 2003, the Cuban government arrested approximately 75 dissenters, who were tried and convicted of accepting funds from foreign sources for political purposes, and approximately one half of these arrested persons were associated with the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> movement. [...] This was met with widespread criticism internationally, and was perceived as a crackdown. Although the project was officially legally rejected on November 2002, the same <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> was brought again to the National Assembly on October 2004. Its promoters claimed that the National Assembly had not responded to the project. The <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> was again re-launched in Madrid on October 2008.|$|E
2500|$|The {{organization}} {{reported having}} collected 11,020 signatures, {{but neither the}} Constitution nor any complementary law authorizes a proposal of law by citizens without proving their right to vote. Article 88 of the Constitution does not refer to any signature, and the Article 64 of the Rules of the National Assembly clearly request as quantum of proof a notarized affidavit. Thus, the legal requisite for consideration by Cuban National Assembly is not a number at all, but {{the legal status of}} voter. [...] The Cuban National Assembly's Constitution and Legal Affairs Committee did not suspend consideration of the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> citizens' initiative, but responded to it with an expert opinion, dated on November 1, 2002, and forwarded to the promoters by courier on November 18 and by certified mail on November 26. This expert opinion dismissed the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> because of formal and substantial grounds. Formally, the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> did not prove the voter status of those who had provided their names, national identification numbers, addresses, and signatures. Also it wasn't presented as a proposal of law, but as a mix of allegations regarding legal issues that should be articulate as separate laws. Moreover, the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> mixed up referendum and popular consultation, which are two different constitutional issues. The Cuban regime did not respond to the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> with its own counter initiative, providing that the Cuban Constitution be amended to make permanent the socialist nature of the Cuban state. Such was the response to the U.S. President's speeches on May 20, 2002, and the foreign media broke the news that the huge mobilization [...] — a typical resource of the Cuban regime against the U.S. — for irrevocable socialism was the response to the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project.</b> In fact, the response was limited since the very beginning to the expert opinion by the aforementioned Constitution and Legal Affairs Committee. [...] A BBC reporter noted that many Cubans said they felt pressured into signing the government's petition. [...] According to the United States State Department, [...] "activists reported increased harassment by State Security agents. Authorities arrested and detained Varela activists, confiscated signatures, fined and threatened activists and signers, and forced signers to rescind signatures. State Security impersonated canvassing volunteers and increasingly infiltrated the ranks of activists. In May and June, Oswaldo Paya reported State Security agents visited and pressured more than 50 <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> signatories to retract their signatures and denounce the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> activists who had collected their signatures." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{official}} {{response to}} the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> was a dismissal by both formal and substantial grounds. The latter was argued in terms of unconstitutionality.

The response simply dismissed the entire project as a disorderly way to amend the Cuban Constitution, which is not possible through mere proposal of laws.|$|E
2500|$|Article 88(h) of the Cuban constitution, {{adopted in}} 1976, {{provides}} for citizen proposals of law, prerequisite that the proposal {{be made by}} at least 10,000 citizens who are eligible to vote.

2500|$|Cuba {{maintains}} {{that the head of}} the US Special Interests section in Havana, James Cason has given money, gifts and support to dissidents in Cuba, associated with the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project,</b> and that: [...] "For these reasons, a few dozen persons directly linked to the conspiratorial activities headed by James Cason have been arrested by the relevant authorities and will be brought to trial." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Cuban National Assembly Constitution and Legal Affairs Committee tabled the <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> citizens' {{initiative}} and {{responded with a}} counter initiative, the petition for which collected 8.1 million signatures, to request that Cuba's National Assembly amend the constitution to state [...] "Socialism and the revolutionary political and social system...are irrevocable; and Cuba will never again return to capitalism." [...] At the same time, millions of Cubans took to the street {{in support of the}} government. The BBC reported that some citizens had felt pressured to sign the government petition.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> was {{announced}} as relying on Article #88(g) of the Cuban Constitution [...] of 1976, as amended in 1992, which allows citizens to propose laws if 10,000 who {{are entitled to}} vote support the proposal with a notarized affidavit that the Varela Project's promoters failed to bring together with the project itself. The simple collection, in any number, of names, national identification numbers, addresses, and signatures does not support any proposal of law {{in accord with the}} Cuban Constitution and its complementary legislation, which in this case is the Rules of the National Assembly (1996).|$|E
2500|$|Jose Daniel Ferrer Garcia, a <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> {{leader and}} one of the 75 activists arrested, {{reported}} serving 45 days in a punishment cell with no light or available water for protesting the suspension of correspondence and the delivery of food and medical supplies from his family.

Ferrer is serving a 25-year sentence for [...] "acts against the independence or the territorial integrity of the State." ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> was lauded by some outside {{observers}} such {{as former}} US President Jimmy Carter, in a May 2002 speech in Havana, Cuba, and the European Union, which awarded Payá the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. They {{did not have}} a clue about the applicable Cuban Law. Other observers are skeptical: Attempts to bring about democratic change in Cuba with the aid of US financing have long been criticized by pundits as [...] "Dead on Arrival" [...] when the initiatives reach Cuba, as there is widespread popular opposition in Cuba to US intervention in Cuban politics (as such, dissidents receiving money from US sources, especially from the CIA, are immediately discredited in Cuban politics). [...] 2004 Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry called the initiative and its results [...] "counterproductive".|$|E
2500|$|The Foreign Minister of the Republic of Cuba, Felipe Pérez Roque stated on April 9, 2003, that [...] "The <b>Varela</b> <b>Project</b> {{is part of}} a {{strategy}} of subversion against Cuba that has been conceived, financed, and directed from abroad with the active participation of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. It is part of the same subversive design and has no basis whatsoever in Cuban law. It is a crude manipulation of Cuba’s laws and Constitution." [...] and [...] "The U.S. Interests Section’s diplomatic pouch is being increasingly used to bring funds and the means for the exercise of counterrevolutionary acts in Cuba to groups created and funded by the U.S. government. To sum up, we have a situation where there has been an increase in subversive actions, disrespect for Cuban laws, and open defiance of Cuba’s legal institutions, which all diplomatic representations should respect in their work in our country." ...|$|E
