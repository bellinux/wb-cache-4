2500|$|In 1999 Yad Vashem {{historian}} Avraham Milgram {{published a}} study where {{he asserted that}} [...] "the discrepancy between the reality and {{the myth of the}} number of visas granted by Sousa Mendes is great." [...] According to Milgram it was probably Harry Ezratty who was the first to mention in an article published in 1964 that Sousa Mendes had saved 30,000 refugees, of which 10,000 were Jews, a number which has since then been repeated automatically by journalists and academics. Milgram says that Ezratty, imprudently, took the total number of Jewish refugees who passed through Portugal and ascribed it to the work of Aristides de Sousa Mendes. To make his point Milgram cross checked the numbers from the Bordeaux ‘s <b>visa</b> <b>register</b> entry books with those of the HICEM reports and although he acknowledged that visas delivered in cities of Bayonne, Hendaye and Toulouse cannot be exactly determined, Milgram asserted that the numbers are exaggerated. Again in 2011, Milgram published a densely researched book, “Portugal Salazar and the Jews” and for a second time he asserted that: [...] "authors, especially those who wish to sing the praises of Aristides de Sousa Mendes, tend to overstate the number of visas with figures that not satisfy research criteria, but rather correspond to their wishful thinking".|$|E

Bangkok, the home of two-thirds of all the registered Japanese residents in Thailand, has the fourth-largest Japanese expatriate population of any city in the world outside Japan, only behind Los Angeles, New York City, and Shanghai. Japanese residents themselves suspect that their actual population number may be several times more than the official figures, because many transient residents, especially those on long-term tourist <b>visas,</b> fail to <b>register</b> with their local Japanese consulates.|$|R
2500|$|On February 11, 2009, {{legislation}} {{was introduced by}} Representatives John Shadegg (R-AZ), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), and Ed Pastor (D-AZ) in the 111th Congress to the House of Representatives, HR 1001 ("The Nursing Relief Act of 2009": To create a new non-immigrant <b>visa</b> category for <b>registered</b> nurses, and for other purposes) making a new non-immigrant [...] "W" [...] visa category for nurses {{to be able to}} work in the United States. This was to relieve the nursing shortage still considered to be a crisis despite the economic problems in the country. The proposed bill was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary but was never reported on by Committee.|$|R
40|$|The {{whereabouts}} of migrants: {{a comparison of}} Dutch migrant registration systems. Today, one way of visualising the current refugee and migrant crisis on the outer borders of Europe is by showing a bottleneck in the processing of migrant flows: large groups of people waiting endlessly for their registration before {{they are allowed to}} enter ‘the promised land’. But registering and mobility is not a new phenomenon: With the emergence of the modern nation-state, the distinction between ‘foreigner’ and ‘national’ became more important. States started to set up information systems. From 1840 onwards population registers in western European countries were introduced, which made it possible to monitor mobility of individuals, residents or aliens, over time and to discern specific migrant streams (Moch 2003). National consular services, responsible for issuing <b>visas</b> <b>registered</b> citizens abroad, while national security and aliens registration services collected information on inward migrants. During World War II, the allies started to coordinate attempts to establish migration management on a global scale. These were continued after 1945, when countries were confronted with new and large groups of displaced persons, demographic problems, security issues and questions of manpower. With millions of people on the move who wanted to leave Europe, it resulted in multilateral collaboration to regulate migration and a plethora of more specific migrant registration systems. In these years the Dutch government started their so called active migration policy, facilitating emigration, in close collaboration with civil society organizations. Migration studies usually have a strong focus on the inward movement. As a result the data (and policy files) of the aliens registration services, collected with the purpose of ‘control’ and ‘monitoring’, are best known. The aim {{of this paper is to}} make a comparative analysis of migrant registration systems in order to asses a Dutch registration system of Dutch nationals to Australia (1946 - 1991). Records with data on over 50, 000 migrant units (90 % of the Dutch-Australian migrants) were kept from the moment they applied to the moment that they settled – and sometimes even long afterwards. What kind of information was registered, by whom and what was the original purpose of this system? Why wanted the Dutch authorities to monitor citizens who left? And what can we discern today from the different layers of information about the bureaucratic habits of civil servants? I will argue that the original function of the cards was no more than an index on personal files of selected migrants, which developed into a system that was deliberately used by Dutch authorities for migration policy goals...|$|R
50|$|On 14 February 2012, Salgaocar SC, the I-League club, {{announced}} {{the signing of}} Maxime Belouet as their fourth Foreign <b>Visa</b> player and <b>registered</b> him for the 2012 AFC Cup and I-League. He was the first French footballer to ply his trade in India. He played both in the 2012-13 I-League and 2012 AFC Cup matches for the club where his performance was highly praised by football fans and critics and he was compared to be equally good to the famous Mohun Bagan A.C. player Jose Ramirez Barreto. He then got injured while playing against Al-Oruba SC of Oman in the 2012 AFC Cup. As a result, {{he had to go}} back to France to get the top treatment. He later recovered from the injury totally and became fit to play in the 2013-14 I-League season.|$|R

Dr Hopper’s contribution, “Coming Off the Rails”, focuses on O’Brien’s most inventive and intriguing short story, “John Duffy’s Brother” (1940), which was made into an award-winning short film in 2006. The essay discusses both the story and the film, and explores some of its more secretive subtexts. It also locates the story as one of the earliest, and most exuberant, examples of post-modern fiction. Dr Hopper, who is a recognised authority on Flann O’Brien, said: “As a long-time Flanneur, I am pleased {{to be part of the}} latest project in the growing field of O’Brien studies. Cork University Press has published a number of important works on O’Brien, and are to be commended for this handsome and well-edited volume. ...|$|R
