5|$|Under {{appellation}} rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) {{of grapes}} can be pressed to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuvée {{and the next}} 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that <b>vintage</b> <b>year</b> while non-vintage wine {{is a blend of}} vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a minimum of three years of aging. There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier Champagne houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses keep their wines on the lees through the whole time of aging because it is more expense to bottle the wine then age it and finally shipped.|$|E

25|$|For consistency, non-vintage wines can be blended {{from more}} than one vintage, which helps wine-makers sustain a {{reliable}} market image and maintain sales even in bad years. One recent study suggests that for the average wine drinker, the <b>vintage</b> <b>year</b> may not be as significant for perceived quality as had been thought, although wine connoisseurs continue to place great importance on it.|$|E

25|$|The white wines {{made from}} the Moscato Bianco (also known as Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains) are most noted for their frizzante and {{sparkling}} spumante styles but some still wines are produced as well. Located northeast of Alba, the wines from the Asti region {{are known for their}} delicate light bodies, low alcohol content and slightly sweet nature. Like many sparkling wines, Asti are not vintage dated even though a majority of the grapes might all come from the same <b>vintage</b> <b>year.</b> The wines are typically at their peak between 1 and 2 years from their release.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{being made}} {{primarily}} from the same grape, pinot noir, winemaking styles in the Cote de Nuits is far from monolithic. The individual style of the producer or negociant and the decisions they make at {{each step of the}} winemaking process — beginning with the sorting table as they grapes arrive from the harvest — will affect the resulting quality of the wine immensely. It is this reason, along with the varied and complex ownership of most grand and premier cru vineyards, that most wine experts put more weight on the reputation of the producer and the <b>vintage</b> <b>year</b> than on the vineyard name when it comes to evaluating all Burgundy wine-the Cote de Nuits not excluded.|$|E
25|$|Spanish {{wines are}} often labeled {{according}} {{to the amount of}} aging the wine has received. When the label says vino joven ("young wine") or sin crianza, the wines will have undergone very little, if any, wood aging. Depending on the producer, some of these wines will be meant to be consumed very young - often within a year of their release. Others will benefit from some time aging in the bottle. For the <b>vintage</b> <b>year</b> (vendimia or cosecha) to appear on the label, a minimum of 85% of the grapes must be from that year's harvest. The three most common aging designations on Spanish wine labels are Crianza, Reserva and Gran Reserva.|$|E

25|$|Smaragd: The ripest wines {{that must}} contain at least 12.5% APV. The maximum {{residual}} sugar level for these wines is 9 g/l. This designation {{was first used}} in 1986, right after the diethylene glycol scandal and was intended to denote the highest quality level of Wachau wines. All grapes destined for this designation must attain at least 18.5°KMW and all finished wine must be sealed with a long natural cork that is at least 49mm long and branded with <b>vintage</b> <b>year,</b> since 2007 also screwcaps are allowed. The wines have to be aged in bottle and not released till after May 1 following harvest though some producers will age their inventory longer. Smaragd wines {{tend to be the}} most sought after and critically acclaimed Wachau wines with well made examples from favorable vintages having the potential to age for more than 20 years. The symbol for this class is an emerald lizard that can found sunning itself on the stone terraces along the Danube.|$|E
500|$|Considerable {{variations}} {{exist in}} the pisco used in the cocktails. According to food and wine expert Mark Spivak, the difference is in the way both beverages are produced; whereas [...] "Chilean pisco is mass-produced", the Peruvian version [...] "is made in small batches." [...] Cocktail historian Andrew Bohrer focuses his comparison on taste, claiming that [...] "n Peru, pisco is made in a pot still, distilled to proof, and un-aged; it {{is very similar to}} grappa. In Chile, pisco is made in a column still and aged in wood; it is similar to a very light cognac." [...] Chilean oenologist Patricio Tapia adds that while Chilean pisco producers usually mix vine stocks, Peruvian producers have specific pisco types that use the aromatic qualities of vines such as Yellow Muscat and Italia. Tapia concludes this is why Peruvian pisco bottles denote their <b>vintage</b> <b>year</b> and the Chilean versions do not.|$|E
