40|$|Background: The {{constant}} {{increase of}} aquaculture production and wealthy seafood consumption {{has forced the}} industry to explore alternative and more sustainable raw aquafeed materials, and plant ingredients {{have been used to}} replace marine feedstuffs in many farmed fish. The objective {{of the present study was}} to assess whether plant-based diets can induce changes in the intestinal mucus proteome, gut autochthonous microbiota and disease susceptibility of fish, and whether these changes could be reversed by the addition of sodium butyrate to the diets. Three different trials were performed using the teleostean gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) as model. In a first preliminary short-term trial, fish were fed with the additive (0. 8 %) supplementing a basal diet with low <b>vegetable</b> <b>inclusion</b> (D 1) and then challenged with a bacteria to detect possible effects on survival. In a second trial, fish were fed with diets with greater <b>vegetable</b> <b>inclusion</b> levels (D 2, D 3) and the long-term effect of sodium butyrate at a lower dose (0. 4 %) added to D 3 (D 4 diet) was tested on the intestinal proteome and microbiome. In a third trial, the long-term effectiveness of sodium butyrate (D 4) to prevent disease outcome after an intestinal parasite (Enteromyxum leei) challenge was tested. Results: The results showed that opposed forces were driven by dietary plant ingredients and sodium butyrate supplementation in fish diet. On the one hand, vegetable diets induced high parasite infection levels that provoked drops in growth performance, decreased intestinal microbiota diversity, induced the dominance of the Photobacterium genus, as well as altered the gut mucosal proteome suggesting detrimental effects on intestinal function. On the other hand, butyrate addition slightly decreased cumulative mortality after bacterial challenge, avoided growth retardation in parasitized fish, increased intestinal microbiota diversity with a higher representation of butyrate-producing bacteria and reversed most vegetable diet-induced changes in the gut proteome. Conclusions: This integrative work gives insights on the pleiotropic effects of a dietary additive on the restoration of intestinal homeostasis and disease resilience, using a multifaceted approach...|$|E
40|$|Currently UK {{fruit and}} {{vegetable}} intakes are below recommendations. Bread is a staple food consumed by ~ 95 % of adults in western countries. In addition, bread provides an ideal matrix by which functionality can be delivered to the consumer in an accepted food. Therefore, enriching bread with vegetables may be an effective strategy to increase vegetable consumption. This study evaluated consumer acceptance, purchase intent and intention of product replacement of bread enriched with red beetroot, carrot with coriander, red pepper with tomato or white beetroot (80 g vegetable per serving of 200 g) compared to white control bread (0 g vegetable). Consumers (n= 120) rated their liking of the breads overall, {{as well as their}} liking of appearance, flavour and texture using nine-point hedonic scales. Product replacement and purchase intent of the breads was rated using five-point scales. The effect of providing consumers with health information about the breads was also evaluated. There were significant differences in overall liking (P< 0. 0001), as well as liking of appearance (P< 0. 0001), flavour (P= 0. 0002) and texture (P= 0. 04), between the breads. However, the significant differences resulted from the red beetroot bread which was significantly (P< 0. 05) less liked compared to control bread. There {{were no significant differences in}} overall liking between any of the other vegetable-enriched breads compared with the control bread (no <b>vegetable</b> <b>inclusion),</b> apart from the red beetroot bread which was significantly less liked. The provision of health information about the breads did not increase consumer liking of the vegetable-enriched breads. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that vegetable-enriched bread appeared to be an acceptable strategy to increase vegetable intake, however, liking depended on vegetable type...|$|E

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of plant-protein sources in aquafeed has increased {{due to the}} limited amount and increasing cost of fishmeal available for production of animal feeds (Burr et al., 2012). One {{of the greatest challenges}} for the aquafeed industry is to reduce fishmeal levels in feed further and increase the amount of plant protein and ingredient diversity in diets of carnivorous fishes. Fish meal free diets have been successfully used but problems related to some anti-nutritional factors have not allowed so far a total substitution of fish meal. In addition, higher <b>inclusion</b> level of <b>vegetable</b> meals, cause reduces weight gain and feed efficiency as well as morphological changes of the digestal intestinal epithelium (Buttle et al., 2004).

40|$|A {{feeding trial}} was {{conducted}} to define the optimal mixtures of either sunflower oil (SFO) or linseed oil (LO) with fish oil (FO), in fish meal (FM) based diets for gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) fingerling, without significant effect on fish performance, fatty acid composition and liver structure. The trial lasted nine weeks with 420 fish (~ 4. 0 g) testing seven isonitrogenous (~ 48 % CP) and isolipidic (~ 18 % L) diets contained three incremental inclusions of either SFO or LO (40, 48, 56 g[*]kg- 1) and the only-fish oil control (CTRL) diet. Results showed {{that the combination of}} 32 g fish oil plus 48 g of either SFO or LO kg- 1 diet as the lipid source had performed the best among all.

Diet induced- changes in hepatic morphology with <b>vegetable</b> oil <b>inclusion</b> level were further described. Linolenic acid (α-LNA, n- 3) had led to less pronounced steatosis symptoms than linoleic acid (LOA, n- 6) in liver cells. This study provides sound support for the use of preferably sunflower oil then linseed oil as a complementary lipid resource (48 g[*]kg[*]diet- 1) with marine fish oil in gilthead seabream fingerling diets.

40|$|Linseed, camelina, perilla and echium oils are n- 3 C 18 {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acid}} (PUFA) -rich vegetable oil sources viewed as favorable replacements to fish oil in aquaculture feed (aquafeed) production in consideration of their high α- linolenic acid (ALA; 18 : 3 n- 3) and/or stearidonic acid (SDA; 18 : 4 n- 3) contents and potential for subsequent bio-conversion to n- 3 long chain {{polyunsaturated fatty acid}}s (LC-PUFA) in farmed aquatic species. While the total production of these oils is currently low in comparison with other terrestrial oil sources, their distinct fatty acid composition and high n- 3 /n- 6 ratio delivers a unique substitute to fish oil in aquafeeds, presently unparalleled in other alternative terrestrial oil sources. The dietary inclusion of these oil sources has therefore attracted significant research attention, resulting in a multitude of investigations across {{a broad range of}} aquatic species (finfish and crustaceans). Generally, providing that the essential fatty acids (EFA) requirements of the species under investigation were met and an adequate level of fishmeal was present in the diet, it was found possible to replace 100 % and 60 - 70 % of the dietary fish oil component for freshwater and marine species, respectively, with minimal impact on growth performance indices. However, the substitution of fish oil with n- 3 -rich vegetable oils and/or vegetable oil blends resulted in substantially reduced concentrations of health promoting eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20 : 5 n- 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22 : 6 n- 3) in the edible portion of the farmed species. This Chapter provides an overview of the use of n- 3 PUFA-rich vegetable oils and/or vegetable oil blends for use in aquafeeds. In particular, key aspects of oil production, processing and refinement will be presented and individual differences pertaining to the physical, chemical and nutritional characteristics of the oil types will be highlighted. Following on from this, a summary of the key findings relevant to n- 3 PUFA-rich <b>vegetable</b> oil <b>inclusion</b> in aquafeeds will be discussed, with particular emphasis placed on growth performance and nutritional modificatio...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To assess {{dietary intake}} and serum mineral and vitamin levels in elderly people from Northwest Spain {{consuming}} a Mediterranean diet, rich in vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, olive oil, dairy products and moderate in wine. Methods: Cross-sectional observational study in four retirement homes. Forty-five men and 65 women participated. Dietary intake and serum calcium, magnesium, iron, retinol, α-tocopherol, albumin, cholesterol, glucose and hematological parameters were determined. Results: Mean consumption of fruit plus vegetables was 600 g/day. Men consumed significantly more legumes, fruit, meat, and alcoholic beverages, but fewer vegetables than women. Women presented higher carbohydrate and lower alcohol energy contributions. Men consumed significantly more thiamin, niacin equivalents, riboflavin, retinol equivalents and iron. Vitamin D intake was 2. 2 ± 1. 2 μg/day and folate intake was 204 ± 47 μg/day without gender differences. Prevalence of anemia was 6. 7 % {{and that of}} high ferritin, 1. 8 %. Serum cholesterol and retinol were higher in women. Mean serum α-tocopherol/cholesterol ratio in the whole population was 6. 3 ± 2. 3 mmol/mol without gender differences. Conclusion: This elderly population consumes an Atlantic-Mediterranean diet that appears, according to biochemical and hematological parameters, appropriate. However, more fatty fish and leafy green <b>vegetables</b> and the <b>inclusion</b> of fortified foods in the diet might optimize micronutrient status. Copyright © 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

40|$|International audienceThe {{plant growth}} {{regulator}} 2 -(1 -naphthyl) acetamide (NAAm) is susceptible to degradation by sunlight and UV light in aqueous solution. Its inclusion complex with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) was characterized by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and its photodegradation was {{compared with that of}} aqueous solutions of NAAm. The complex was formed with a stoichiometric ratio of 1 : 1 with a binding constant of 651 M− 1. The photodegradation behavior of NAAm in the inclusion complex NAAm:β-CD was investigated using both UV (λ = 254 nm) and simulated solar light (Suntest) irradiation. It was found that the NAAm:β-CD complex increases NAAm photostability towards photochemical degradation markedly. In addition, an influence of β-CD concentration was also observed on NAAm degradation rate: higher β-CD concentrations lead to a slower photoinduced transformation. Moreover, some differences were found in the photoproducts in the presence and absence of the cyclodextrin, indicating inhibition of some of the mechanistic pathways. β-CD stabilizes NAAm photodegradation towards sunlight and UV irradiation, enhancing its efficient application on formulations for the treatment of fruits and <b>vegetables.</b> Journal of <b>Inclusion</b> Phenomena and Macrocyclic Chemistry Journal of Inclusion Phenomena and Macrocyclic Chemistry LookInsideOther actions Export citation Register for Journal Updates About This Journal Reprints and Permissions Add to PapersShareShare this content on Facebook Share this content on Twitter Share this content on LinkedI...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThere {{has been}} limited study {{of all types of}} food stores, such as {{traditional}} (supercenters, supermarkets, and grocery stores), convenience stores, and non-traditional (dollar stores, mass merchandisers, and pharmacies) as potential opportunities for purchase of fresh and processed (canned and frozen) fruits and vegetables, especially in small-town or rural areas. MethodsData from the Brazos Valley Food Environment Project (BVFEP) are combined with 2000 U. S. Census data for 101 Census block groups (CBG) to examine neighborhood access to fruits and vegetables. BVFEP data included identification and geocoding of all food stores (n = 185) in six rural counties in Texas, using ground-truthed methods and on-site assessment of the availability and variety of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables in all food stores. Access from the population-weighted centroid of each CBG was measured using proximity (minimum network distance) and coverage (number of shopping opportunities) for a good selection of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables. Neighborhood inequalities (deprivation and vehicle ownership) and spatial access for fruits and vegetables were examined using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test and multivariate regression models. ResultsThe variety of fruits or vegetables was greater at supermarkets compared with grocery stores. Among non-traditional and convenience food stores, the largest variety was found at dollar stores. On average, rural neighborhoods were 9. 9 miles to the nearest supermarket, 6. 7 miles and 7. 4 miles to the nearest food store with a good variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, respectively, and 4. 7 miles and 4. 5 miles to a good variety of fresh and processed fruits or vegetables.

40|$|People are {{encouraged}} to consume more fresh vegetables due to the high nutritional value and fibre contents in vegetables. At the same time, due to pesticidal residue in vegetables, vegetable consumption is considered as an important route of pesticides uptake by human beings. Pesticides, particularly organochlorines such as Aldrin, heptachlor and isomers of dichlorodiphe - nyltrichloroethane (DDT) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) are a major concern because of their persistence, bioaccumulation, toxicity, and long-range environmental transport ability. Hence information on such toxic contaminants in vegetables is very essential, due to human health concern. In order to assess the potential health risks associated with vegetable consumption due to pesticidal residues of DDT and HCH, sixty four samples of commonly available vegetables were collected from a local market in West Bengal, India and analysed for DDT and HCH. In this study, estimated average daily intake of HCHs and DDTs through vegetables was ranged between 5. 0 x 10 – 8 – 9. 1 x 10 – 6 mg kg – 1 day – 1 with an average value of 2. 0 x 10 – 6 mg kg – 1 day – 1. Human health risk was assessed in terms of incremental lifetime cancer risk and health hazard index was between 1. 7 x 10 – 8 – 8. 8 x 10 – 6 and 1. 5 x 10 – 7 – 1. 7 x 10 – 2, respectively. Generated results were compared with maximum residual levels and reference values, were within acceptable limits and suggested no health risk to the human populations. Therefore, an extensive study on <b>vegetables</b> with the <b>inclusion</b> of other persistent organic pollutants and toxic metals should be carried out to know the overall scenario of contamination of vegetables...|$|R
40|$|Nutrition {{during the}} early life of turkey poults has a long lasting impact on bird performance, as well as {{gastrointestinal}} tract (GIT) development. This research focused on understanding the impact of protein source provided in the feed on performance and GIT development. All statistical analysis was completed using Proc Mixed in SAS 9. 3 and significant differences were set at P≤ 0. 05, while trends were identified for P≤ 0. 10. The first study (5 x 2 factorial arrangement) evaluated apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn) and apparent ileal amino acid digestibility (AIAAD) of five high protein feed ingredients (soybean meal, SBM; corn gluten meal, CGM; canola protein concentrate, CPC; fish meal, FM; and porcine meal, PM) in male broiler chickens at 5 and 21 d with 6 replications of 30 and 8 chicks, respectively. The AMEn was not affected by bird age for CPC, FM, CGM, and SBM, however, the d 5 value for PM was higher than the d 21 value. The response of AIAAD was variable and dependent on amino acid and protein source, but overall, {{there was an increase}} in AIAAD with increasing age, with the largest increase observed for CGM. These AMEn and AIAAD values were then used to formulate the diets for a second experiment. The diets for this experiment consisted of a high SBM control diet, and four additional diets with either CPC, FM, PM, or CGM replacing 25 % of the protein that was supplied by SBM in the control diet. This experiment was set up as a completely randomized design with four pens of 23 turkey poults per protein source. Body weights, feed and water intake, and mortality were recorded on a weekly basis. At the same time, four pens of 21 poults per protein source were used to study the impact of these diets on GIT development and blood metabolic profiling. At hatch, placement, d 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21, intestinal tract and tissue weights were collected and recorded (2 poults per replication per time point). Ileal segments were collected at hatch, placement, d 1, 3, 5, and 7 from 2 poults per replicate pen of the SBM and PM diets to study the effect of diet on intestinal morphology, number of goblet cells, and transcript abundance for selected genes relating to barrier function and inflammation. Blood samples were also drawn at these time points for blood metabolite analysis. Data were analyzed as a 5 x 9 factorial for tissues weights, a 2 x 5 factorial for histology and gene expression, and a 5 x 5 factorial for blood analysis. Planned contrasts were used on the performance, tissue, and blood data to compare the SBM diet to the average of the remaining diets, the PM diet to the average of the remaining diets, and the addition of animal or <b>vegetable</b> proteins. <b>Inclusion</b> of an additional protein source increased body weight up to 14 d, in comparison to poults fed the SBM diet, but feed efficiency and water consumption were not affected. The effect of diet on tissue weights were small, {{with the exception of the}} pancreas weight, which were higher in the birds fed vegetable protein diets. Age had an effect on all tissue weights, which peaked between d 2 and 7, as well as on digestive tract morphology and gene expression. There was an increase in gene expression between placement and d 1, which could illustrate the importance of feed as an activator of barrier function and the immune system. The goblet cell counts revealed a greater proportion of neutral goblet cells in PM fed birds associated with accelerated mucus maturation. The research shows there are benefits to limiting the amount of SBM provided in early turkey feeds, especially prior to two weeks of age...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteDelores ChambersThe rising {{awareness}} of celiac disease, an intestinal intolerance to gluten, {{has increased the}} demand for gluten-free products. Gluten is a protein that provides structure to breads, cakes, cookies, and other wheat-flour based baked goods. When flour and water are combined and mixed, the proteins glutenin and gliaden present in wheat combine and a network of gluten is formed. In addition to providing structure and elasticity to dough, it also traps air within the matrix and allows baked goods to rise and maintain desirable characteristics such as an open and airy crumb structure and chewiness of bread products. Removing gluten from a baked good formulation affects the finished product in many ways. This review examines research conducted {{on the effects of}} many various ingredients on finished product quality of gluten-free baked goods. Quality parameters that are most greatly affected by the exclusion of gluten in baked goods include specific volume (a measure of the amount of air incorporated into the finished product), height, spread ratio (the ratio of diameter to thickness in cookies and like products), color, and hardness. Gluten-free baked goods are recognized to be denser, shorter in height, have a larger spread, have a different color, and be harder in texture than traditional wheat-based baked goods. Various gluten-free ingredients have been studied for their use in producing a finished product that exhibits quality parameters similar to wheat-based baked goods. These include rice, potato, tapioca, corn, and sorghum; pseudocereals such as buckwheat, amaranth, and quinoa; legumes; nuts; and waste from fruit and <b>vegetable</b> processing. The <b>inclusion</b> of additives such as hydrocolloids, protein concentrates, emulsifiers, and acidic ingredients are extensively utilized and studied in gluten-free baked good applications. Gluten-free baked goods commonly have a reduced shelf life as compared to wheat-based products. The weak association of water with the starches present in gluten-free baked goods allows moisture to migrate to the outside of the product and rapidly escape. Shelf life studies are also included in much of the research and are summarized in this review. Because consumers desire gluten-free products that taste like the gluten-containing products they replace, many studies pertaining to gluten-free ingredient research include sensory analysis. Some studies include a wheat-based product as a control, while others use only gluten-free formulations in the research. Future research using better sensory methods are needed in this product category. Food manufacturers who wish to compete in the still growing gluten-free market have many ingredient resources available to them to produce high quality gluten-free baked goods. Through research conducted on alternative flours, starches, hydrocolloids, emulsifiers, and other ingredients, gluten-free consumers can enjoy baked goods that exhibit the same desirable qualities as traditional wheat-flour based products...|$|R
40|$|South Africans {{frequently}} consume {{red meat}} {{as part of}} their diet. However the nutrient content of South African sheep meat is derived from other countries. The Red Meat Industry considered it essential to have more reliable data and thus the nutrient content of A 2 South African lamb was recently determined and published. This is the next phase of the study in which the right sides of C 2 mutton carcasses were used to determine the nutrient and physical (carcass) composition of each raw cut as well as the whole carcass by calculation. Eighteen mutton carcasses of the most commonly consumed breeds, namely Dorper and Merino, in South Africa were selected. The carcasses were obtained from large abattoirs form three mutton producing regions in South Africa namely Ermelo, the Karoo and Kalahari. Chilled carcass sides were subdivided into ten primal cuts. Three cuts (shoulder, loin and leg) from the left side were cooked {{in order to determine the}} nutrient composition thereof. The cuts were dissected into meat which consists of muscle and intramuscular fat, intermuscular - plus subcutaneous fat and bone in order to determine the physical composition per cut and for the whole carcass. Meat compromise of 63. 2 % of the carcass, with bone contributing to 20. 5 % and fat to 16. 9 %. Results showed differences in the physical composition of South African C 2 mutton as it contains on average 47 % less fat and 19 % more lean muscle, when compared to previous published composition data. Three cuts (shoulder, loin and leg) from the left side were cooked in order to determine the nutrient composition thereof. Cooking resulted in an increase in the protein and cholesterol concentrations of the cooked cuts. Iron content was higher in the cooked loin and leg but decreased in the cooked shoulder. According to nutrient density, a 100 g edible portion of the leg, loin and shoulder have a nutrient density higher than one for protein, iron, zinc and vitamin B 12 indicating that these cuts are a good source of these specific nutrients. A 100 g edible portion of the loin cut contained higher fat quantities than the cooked shoulder and leg cuts. The loin cut also had a higher cholesterol content at 70. 8 mg compared the 58. 5 mg cholesterol content in the shoulder and 57. 9 mg in the leg cut. However, these values were calculated with all associated subcutaneous fat and it is known that many consumers trim on plate, especially the loin cut. Considering the fact that significant differences were apparent between the current study and previous data derived from other countries, it emphasizes the importance of determining the nutrient composition of South African food products in order to increase the validity of the SA food composition tables. Food-based approaches targeting the relief of micronutrient deficiency usually encourage the consumption of animal foods together with the consumption of green leafy <b>vegetables</b> (GLV). The <b>inclusion</b> of GLV and red meat, two micronutrient rich foods, can be a strategy based on mutual supplementation to combat nutritional deficiencies as it has the potential to alleviate numerous micronutrient deficiencies including iron and vitamin A deficiency.
