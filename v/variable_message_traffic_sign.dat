An even earlier test is not mentioned. A <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> is called VMS in the following. The tests are described approximately in the sequence they were carried out. To some degree the sequence {{describes a}} "learning by doing" process in which later tests were based on earlier tests. All the tests involve presentation {{of a number of}} prearranged messages on a VMS, representing variation of some parameters supposedly related to the readability of the messages, to a group of test persons. In the early tests, the criterion for the readability was the reading distance of each of the messages for each of the test persons. In the later tests the criterion was rating of the readability at predetermined distances...|$|E

A new, aluminum extrusion, ("Jersey") barrier was also installed to separate opposing traffic flows. In addition, the elevators and electrical systems in the two towers were replaced, and new <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>signs</b> and <b>traffic</b> control devices were installed on the bridge, approach roadways, and toll plaza. The toll plaza also received a brand-new service building.|$|R
50|$|Operations and {{management}} involve traffic engineering, so that vehicles move smoothly {{on the road}} or track. Older techniques include signs, signals, markings, and tolling. Newer technologies involve intelligent transportation systems, including advanced traveler information systems (such as <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>signs),</b> advanced <b>traffic</b> control systems (such as ramp meters), and vehicle infrastructure integration. Human factors are an aspect of transportation engineering, particularly concerning driver-vehicle interface and user interface of road signs, signals, and markings.|$|R
50|$|In the 2010s, {{the road}} {{received}} a <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign</b> (VMS) <b>traffic</b> information system to inform travellers {{on the road}} of incidents and closures, in a more timely fashion than the old, hand-changed signs. The system received a 2012 New Zealand Engineering Excellence Award, {{partly due to the}} information system using satellite links as their primary communication system making unnecessary the much more costly laying of communications cables along the road. The message signs are powered by small hydro-power systems with battery back-ups.|$|R

Permanent CMS displays are mounted on large sign structures overhead or alongside the road. These devices are often placed on urban freeways which have traffic problems. Portable CMS (PCMS) panels are usually mounted on trailers, although some may be carried by trucks. They are often used in work zones or other events that disrupt traffic. CMS devices also follow a uniform shape, design and color that were set by the MUTCD.|$|R

Including vehicle navigation system, mobile phone application, <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign</b> (VMS), <b>traffic</b> radio, a series of information delivery equipment which can meet real demand in information services, are used to support travel decision making of destinations, departure time, routes and travel mode. Along {{with the development of}} information technology which can release plenty of {{travel information}}, it will be a considerable challenge to department who furnish the travel information service that requires them to choose which service to provide. To reach that goal, it is fundamental to acquaint themselves to understand market penetration of ATIS equipment and information behavior of traveller. Through the data of drivers’ information behavior of ATIS equipment in Kunming based on tracking survey, this paper reveal that Chinese drivers have a sustainable increased willingness to pay for personalized information service. Market penetration of vehicle navigation, as the most well-used ATIS equipment, is climbing. Satisfaction to vehicle navigation is closely related to utilization frequency, willingness to pay for the map upgrade and utilization load. Furthermore, although users have a distinguished dependency to vehicle navigation, query level is still high...|$|R

40|$|Researches {{indicate}} that foggy weather {{is one of}} the most critical factors that restrict human&# 39;s traffic activities and cause traffic accidents. It will reduce the visibility of <b>traffic</b> <b>message</b> board, which could cause the insecurity of transportation. Commonly, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were used as light source for <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> sign, which could not be seen clearly in the foggy low visibility condition. A high-brightness light source which could be used for variable information board was firstly put forward in this paper. And a new type of <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> sign used in low visibility condition was also introduced. Besides, the attenuation characteristics of laser diode (LD) and light-emitting diode (LED) were analyzed respectively. Calculation and simulation show that the attenuation of red light source is fastest, and the yellow LED light has the better transmittance property. In the experiment, LDs were used to make <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> board for verifying image definition. A 16 ∗ 16 array structure composed of LDs was designed and could display Chinese characters. By comparing the display effect of LDs and LEDs driven with same power, they were placed in fog chamber of the visibility less than 5 meters. And experiment results show that the penetrability of red LD light is better than that of red LED. So <b>traffic</b> <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign</b> based on LDs could improve the image definition and the information could be seen more clearly in the foggy weather. In addition to the high-brightness, good coherence, good direction, experimental results show that <b>traffic</b> <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> board based on LD has better visual effect in low visibility condition. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

40|$|AbstractDue {{to excess}} demand, we {{encounter}} traffic congestion on motorways quite often at bottlenecks {{in the vicinity}} of metropolitan areas in Japan, mainly on holidays. The administrators of motorways have tackled this issue for more than four decades. At the beginning, they just tried {{to increase the number of}} lanes; however, widening of motorways requires huge construction costs and long periods. After the collapse of the bubble economy in the early 1990 s, it became so difficult to broaden the existing motorways. To alleviate traffic congestion, they have introduced comparatively costless innovative attempts; however, those could not eradicate traffic congestion completely. This paper describes the advantageous effects of innovative attempts, methodologies and applied cases, such as traffic information system providing location of the traffic bottleneck to drivers to activate them to gain speed on the upgrade, using the <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>signs,</b> or <b>traffic</b> demand management disseminating real-time traffic information (e. g., travel time, length of the queue) to drivers, resulting in mitigation of traffic congestion on motorways. In recent years, toll discount has been introduced on motorways as a pilot program; the situation of traffic congestion is getting worse. This paper also mentions a quick overview of the countermeasure strategies against traffic congestion and of the state of the congestion on motorways for a couple of decades...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{and timely}} traffic {{information}} enables road users {{to make informed}} decisions to enable them to optimise their route choices by avoiding congestion. Such information is instrumental to transport management as bus and taxi operators can reschedule their fleets in response to prevailing traffic conditions to minimise the effects of traffic congestion on their services. The information can also be used by the traffic management control centres of transport and highway authorities to streamline the timing control of traffic signals and the broadcast of <b>traffic</b> advice via <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>signs.</b> Real-time <b>traffic</b> information is gathered from point-based traffic surveillance and monitoring detectors, and the piecemeal data fitted to interpolate or model road conditions over a transport network. The process of gathering and transforming point-based traffic data to display an area view is computationally intensive and often fails to meet the instant requirements of a real-time traffic information system. The authors propose a real-time traffic multimedia Internet geographic information system that is capable of transmitting video images and modelling road conditions in real time. The prototype system is capable of calibrating data from traffic closed-circuit television images that are modelled over the entire road network for broadcasting to road users on the world-wide web with a time lapse of 3 - 4 minutes. The authors also suggest potential applications of the prototype system. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>sign</b> {{provides}} road {{users with}} the specified instruction and information to enhance traffic safety. Automatic detection of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> {{is important for}} navigation, autonomous driving, transportation asset management, etc. With the advance of laser and imaging sensors, Mobile Mapping System (MMS) becomes widely used in transportation agencies to map the transportation infrastructure. Although many algorithms of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> detection are developed in the literature, they are still a tradeoff between the detection speed and accuracy, especially for the large-scale mobile mapping of both the rural and urban roads. This paper is motivated to efficiently survey <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> while mapping the road network and the roadside landscape. Inspired by the manual delineation of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign,</b> a drawing strategy is proposed to quickly approximate the boundary of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign.</b> Both the shape and color prior of the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> are simultaneously involved during the drawing process. The most common speed-limit sign circle and the statistic color model of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> are studied in this paper. Anchor points of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> edge are located with the local maxima of color and gradient difference. Starting with the anchor points, contour of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> is drawn smartly along the most significant direction of color and intensity consistency. The drawing process is also constrained by the curvature feature of the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> circle. The drawing of linear growth is discarded immediately if it fails to form an arc over some steps. The Kalman filter principle is adopted to predict the temporal context of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign.</b> Based on the estimated point,we can predict and double check the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> in consecutive frames. The event probability of having a <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> over the consecutive observations is compared with the null hypothesis of no perceptible <b>traffic</b> <b>sign.</b> The temporally salient <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> is then detected statistically and automatically as the rare event of having a <b>traffic</b> <b>sign.</b> The proposed algorithm is tested with a diverse set of images that are taken inWuhan, China with theMMS ofWuhan University.

40|$|This {{research}} paper highlights {{the problems that}} are encountered in a typical <b>Traffic</b> <b>Sign</b> Recognition System like incorrect interpretation of a particular <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> which is observed by a driver while driving a vehicle causing misunderstanding thereby resulting in road accidents. The visibility is affected by many environmental factors such as smoke, rain, fog, humid weather, dust etc. {{and it is very}} difficult to understand the <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> in this situations, causing misinterpretations of the particular <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> and resulting in road accidents. In order to avoid this condition, a novel method of recognizing <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> is developed which take into consideration the color and shape of the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign.</b> A algorithm called as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used for classification of different groups of <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> which are predefined by a particular set of features after the process of Image Segmentation. The images are segmented by using the color and shape features of an image and the features are extracted by using the Haar Transform and then the classification of images is done by using Linear Discriminant Analysis Algorithm. Finally the GUI of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> images is prepared by using the software tool called as MATLAB. Our main objective is to recognize partially occluded <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> in a cloudy environment by using LDA and to make an efficient <b>Traffic</b> <b>Sign</b> Detection system which will be capable of recognizing and classifying any kind of known <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> from the other <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> by considering the color and shape of the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> on the basis of supervised classification of the training data so that any error which results in a faulty detection or incorrect detection of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> can be eliminated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The robust {{identification}} of the <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> represents the first {{and one of the}} most important steps in the development of a <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> recognition (TSR) system. <b>Traffic</b> <b>signs</b> detection usually involves a color segmentation process that uses the information related to the chromatic properties of the road <b>signs.</b> Since the <b>traffic</b> video data is captured in diverse road and weather conditions, the problem relating to <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> detection is quite challenging. Among several issues that need to be addressed during this processing stage, the problem generated by mutually occluding <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> (mutual occlusion occurs when one <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> partially occludes the surface of other road signs) that are attached to the same pole require special attention. In these situations the color segmentation process fails to correctly identify the regions that are associated with the <b>traffic</b> <b>signs.</b> These <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> detection failures compromise the performance of other stages of the TSR system and in this paper we propose two approaches that address the segmentation of mutually occluding <b>traffic</b> <b>signs.</b> The first approach uses the information associated with the inner parts of the <b>traffic</b> <b>signs,</b> while the second approach applies the watershed transform to identify the signs that have their borders in contact or are mutually occluding...|$|R

However, among damaged <b>signs,</b> dirty <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> are unique since their damage is not permanent and they just can be cleaned instead of replaced. This study aimed to identify the most important factors contributing to <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> dirt. To do so, a large number of <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> in Utah were measured by deploying a vehicle instrumented with mobile LiDAR imaging and digital photolog technologies.

To identify contributing factors to <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> dirt, the chi-square test was employed. To analyze the data and rank all of the factors based on their importance to the sign dirt, Random forests statistical model was utilized. After analyzing the data, it can be concluded that ground elevation, sign mount height, and air pollution had the highest effect on making <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> dirty. The findings of this investigation assist transportation agencies in determining <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> with a higher likelihood of sign dirt.
