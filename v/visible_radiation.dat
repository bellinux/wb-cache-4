5|$|The <b>visible</b> <b>radiation</b> {{emitted by}} white dwarfs varies {{over a wide}} color range, from the blue-white color of an O-type main {{sequence}} star to the red of an M-type red dwarf. White dwarf effective surface temperatures extend from over 150,000K to barely under 4,000K. In accordance with the Stefan–Boltzmann law, luminosity increases with increasing surface temperature; this surface temperature range corresponds to a luminosity from over 100 times the Sun's to under 1/10,000 that of the Sun's. Hot white dwarfs, with surface temperatures in excess of 30,000K, have been observed to be sources of soft (i.e., lower-energy) X-rays. This enables the composition and structure of their atmospheres to be studied by soft X-ray and extreme ultraviolet observations.|$|E
25|$|Deceleration {{of a free}} charged particle, such as an electron, {{can produce}} visible radiation: {{cyclotron}} radiation, synchrotron radiation, and bremsstrahlung radiation are all examples of this. Particles moving through a medium faster {{than the speed of}} light in that medium can produce visible Cherenkov radiation. Certain chemicals produce <b>visible</b> <b>radiation</b> by chemoluminescence. In living things, this process is called bioluminescence. For example, fireflies produce light by this means, and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake.|$|E
500|$|The {{visual light}} curves of the {{different}} supernova types all depend at late times on radioactive heating, but they vary in shape and amplitude because of the underlying mechanisms, the way that <b>visible</b> <b>radiation</b> is produced, the epoch of its observation, and the transparency of the ejected material. [...] The light curves can be significantly different at other wavelengths. [...] For example, at ultraviolet wavelengths there is an early extremely luminous peak lasting {{only a few hours}} corresponding to the breakout of the shock launched by the initial event, but that breakout is hardly detectable optically.|$|E

2500|$|Most nebulae can be {{described}} as diffuse nebulae, which means that they are extended and contain no well-defined boundaries. [...] Diffuse nebulae can be divided into emission nebula, reflection nebulae and [...] "dark nebulae." [...] Visible light nebulae may be divided into emission nebulae that emit spectral line radiation from excited or ionized gas (mostly ionized hydrogen); [...] they are often called HII regions (the term [...] "HII" [...] refers to ionized hydrogen). Reflection nebulae are visible primarily due to the light they reflect. Reflection nebulae themselves do not emit significant amounts of visible light, but are near stars and reflect light from them. Similar nebulae not illuminated by stars do not exhibit <b>visible</b> <b>radiation,</b> but may be detected as opaque clouds blocking light from luminous objects behind them; they are called [...] "dark nebulae".|$|E

50|$|Apker {{found that}} in {{addition}} to <b>visible</b> <b>radiation,</b> near-ultraviolet radiation also produces photoconductitivty. Deeper into the ultraviolet spectrum, however, potassium iodide has a strong absorption line due to the formation of chargeless particles called excitons. These excitons transfer energy to the electrons in the F-Centers with remarkably high efficiency, and these excited electrons are excited from the crystals in exciton-induced photoemission. Apker observed the same sort of behavior in other crystals such as barium oxide.|$|E

30|$|All the {{measured}} parameters {{are characteristic of}} very clean surfaces: the haze remains below the value (1 %) commonly accepted as being the visual disturbance threshold in the glass industry [17] and the surface coverage {{as well as the}} thickness of the deposit are low. As expected, vertical coupons show less deposition than horizontal ones. The smallest difference between the horizontal and vertical exposures is obtained for the haze. According to the Mie theory, this parameter is essentially sensitive to the presence of fine (submicron) particles that scatter the UV and <b>visible</b> <b>radiations</b> efficiently. Because the deposition of such fine particles is driven more by diffusion than by gravitational settling [34], one does not expect them to deposit very differently on the vertical and horizontal coupons and, as a result, haze is less sensitive to the coupons orientation than the other parameters.|$|R

50|$|IR {{radiation}} is more useful than the <b>visible</b> <b>radiation</b> for heating our body, because we absorb most of it, {{compared to a}} strong reflection of visible light. Penetration depth of infrared radiation in our skin is dependent of wavelength. IR-A is the most penetrating, and reaches some millimeters, IR-B penetrates into the dermis (about 1 mm), and IR-C is mostly absorbed in the external layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum). For this reason the infrared lamps used for therapeutic purposes produce mainly IR-A radiation.|$|E
