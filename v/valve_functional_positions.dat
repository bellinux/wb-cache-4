The implementation of <b>functional</b> <b>position</b> is the effort to assign and measure the performance of librarian through the assessment system of work implementation with credit numbers. Librarian as profession and <b>functional</b> <b>position</b> is demanded to have good performance in doing his/her task and function. Librarians perform professional performance in the field of library based on Permenpan Reformasi Birokrasi No. 9 tahun 2014 (Regulation of the Minister of the State Apparatus Utilization and Bureaucratic Reform Number 9 Year 2014). How is the perception of librarian in that regulation? Does this perception influence the implementation of performance standard in library? Both questions are studied by using descriptive quantitative method and the research sample is purposive sampling, which use 14 librarians in central library of Indonesia University of Education. Fifty percent of librarians agree, and 36 % of them very agree that the cluster, task, function, and stage of librarian <b>functional</b> <b>position</b> concretely provide explanation and comprehension in doing their performance.

40|$|Compared with {{previous}} Laws, Law No. 17 of 2003 concerning State Finance has some fundamental differences and new matters, {{such as the}} post of treasurer as <b>functional</b> <b>position.</b> it shows {{that it is important}} that finance management must be managed by <b>functional</b> <b>position</b> as stated in Article 10 paragraph (3) of Law No. 1 of 2004. Thus, the embodiment of treasurer as <b>functional</b> <b>position</b> must be implemented immediately so that the clear and ideal position and the responsibilities can be realized and cannot be separated from the government role in implementing good governance in state budget since state budget is a form of state financial management that must be transparent and accountable for citizen's prosperity as it provided in UUD NKRI 1945. Therefore, the ideal implementation of state budget for prosperity of people is the embodiment of the government efforts for public interest without any distinction on Indonesian social plurality...|$|R

50|$|Positioning is {{the final}} stage in the ‘STP’ process and focuses on how the {{customer}} ultimately views your product or service in comparison to your competitors and is important in gaining a competitive advantage in the market. Therefore, customer perceptions have {{a huge impact on}} the brands positioning in the market. There are three types of positioning that are key in positioning the brand to a competitive advantage; these are <b>Functional</b> <b>Positioning,</b> Symbolic Positioning, and Experiential <b>positioning.</b> <b>Functional</b> <b>Positioning</b> is focused on the aspects of the products or services that can fulfill consumers’ needs or desires. Symbolic Positioning is based on the characteristics of the brand that fulfill customers’ self-esteem. Experiential positioning is based around the characteristics of the brands that stimulate the sensory or emotional connection with the customers. A combination of the three is key to positioning the brand at a competitive advantage to its immediate competition. Overall, positioning should provide better value than competitors and communicate this differentiation in an effective way to the consumer.|$|R

40|$|ONE of {{the most}} {{difficult}} problems in the management of juvenile rheum-atoid arthritis is to maintain the joints in their correct <b>functional</b> <b>position</b> during the active phases of the disease. During this time the joints are held in flexion deformity by painful muscle spasm, and the child will vigorously resist attempts to extend them passively. The obvious answer is to splint the joint, but this is often difficult (1) because the patient will seldom tolerate splinting of the usual plaster-of-Paris type (cellulose acetate was an advance, but had its difficulties and dangers); and (2) there is often multiple joint involvement, and to make cellulose acetate splints from plaster-of-Paris casts is a lengthy business. Thus, for one reason or another, either the joints are not splinted or the splints are not tolerated, and when the disease goes into remission it is found that the affected joints are fixed in bad <b>functional</b> <b>positions.</b> Unfortunately joints which are of great importance from the functional point of view—the finger and carpal joints, the knee, ankle, and tarsus...|$|R

40|$|Since no {{generally}} accepted guidelines exist on sizing booster charges to assure functional margins in pyrotechnically actuated devices, a {{study was conducted}} to provide an approach to meet this need. An existing pyrovalve was modified from a single cartridge input to a dual-cartridge input with a booster charge. The objectives of this effort were to demonstrate an energy-based functional margin approach for sizing booster charges, and to determine booster charge energy delivery characteristics in this <b>valve.</b> <b>Functional</b> margin was demonstrated by determining the energy required to actuate the valve through weight drop tests for comparison to the energy delivered by the cartridge and booster charge in firings in the modified valve.
