40|$|This report {{presents}} the research conducted {{as part of}} an investigation for the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) regarding the seismic response and overall moment capacity of precast I-girder to inverted-T bent cap bridge connections for seismic applications. The current design practice, as outlined by Caltrans’ Seismic Design Criteria, assumes that the connection between the precast I-girders and the inverted-T bent cap will degrade in a seismic event and shall therefore be designed as a pinned connection, making the precast girder option for seismic bridges inefficient. A prototype I-girder to inverted-T bent cap bridge and a 50 % scale test unit was designed in order to investigate the behavior of the as-built girder-to-cap connection region. Additionally, per the request of Caltrans, an improved girder-to-cap connection detail was developed in order to ensure a fully continuous moment connection between the I-girders and inverted-T bent cap. A finite element grillage model was developed using ABAQUS and SAP 2000 and was used to predict the global and local responses of various aspects of the test unit. The test unit was constructed and tested in two phases of quasi-static cyclic testing. The first phase was a horizontal load test phase, which simulated the effects of gravity and seismic loads on the entire test unit. The second phase was a <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> phase, which specifically focused on the positive and negative moment capacity of the connections. Both the results of the finite element grillage model and the testing were used to make conclusions regarding the performance of Igirder to inverted-T bent cap bridges. It was concluded that the current I-girder to inverted-T bent cap bridge connection is capable of acting as a fully continuous connection for both positive and negative moments during both gravity and seismic loading, contrary to the design assumptions stated in Caltrans’ Seismic Design Criteria. The improved connection detail demonstrated the ability to ensure a fully continuous moment connection between the I-girders and inverted-T bent cap. Both connection details also exhibited a significant moment resistance beyond what was expected during the <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> although the as-built connection eventually failed under positive moments at moderate to large displacements...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} make the Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC) pile, {{developed}} in Phase I of the UHPC Pile Project at Iowa State University (ISU), a viable option in practice, laboratory testing, field testing and installation of a production pile in the field were undertaken during Phase II of this project. A detailed understanding of the section behavior and lateral loading behavior was determined and compared to that of a steal HP 10 x 57 pile through lateral load analyses of a UHPC pile section. The analysis found that UHPC piles were suitable for integral abutments of bridges. To make the field installation of UHPC piles possible, the overall performance of a common pile-to-abutment connection was verified in the laboratory by defining the UHPC pile-to-abutment connection, which is similar to the currently used connection for steel HP 10 x 57 piles. Both piles performances were verified by testing their connection when subjected to weak-axis bending. The test piles met performance criteria during the laboratory displacements of 0. 28 and 0. 42 inches which correspond to 1. 0 and 1. 55 inches in the field. Next, the field testing began to ensure that the production pile would achieve the desired behavior and capacities required by integral abutment bridges. A <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> on a 46 -ft UHPC test pile was completed one week after being driven into the ground at the same site where the UHPC production pile was implemented into a 223 -ft long integral bridge with a 24 ¢ª skew. Before failure, the test pile resisted 1. 5 times the predicted capacity based on the Iowa Bluebook method of design for concrete piles, verifying appropriateness of reducing the UHPC production pile by 16 % in length compared to the specified length of 65 -ft for the HP 10 x 57 piles on the integral bridge. Additionally, a lateral load test was conducted between the second test pile with a newly designed splice detail and the <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> pile, which confirmed the adequacy of the splice detail and the lateral load resistance of the pile. The 46 -ft test pile was also tested during the lateral load test. The results of the laboratory and field studies indicated that the UHPC pile in the field is a viable option...|$|E
40|$|The {{railway track}} {{underwent}} several changes from it early development. In the modern railway track, concrete sleepers {{are widely used}} to accommodate the impact from the high speed train. It is important to increase the strength {{and the weight of}} concrete sleeper, to reduce the vibration and track buckling. High-speed train can cause high vibration to sleeper and this impact will lead cracking in the sleeper. The present concrete sleeper should be able to absorb the stresses and prevent the crack development. In this study, an experimental was carried out to examine behaviour of prestressed concrete sleeper under the rail seat. The positive bending moment at rail seat was carried out in the <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> <b>test.</b> Then 80 % of the yield load which is 204 kN was taken to be the mean value to simulate the repeated load test with amplitude variation of 10 % of the yield. The hairline crack developed has been under the rail seat measuring 176 mm maximum with a crack mouth of 0. 374 mm. Under the repeated load test the cracks occurred at mid span of the PSC with maximum 164 mm and crack mouth of 0. 4 mm. The study of the behaviour of PSC with 4 wire showed that the tested PSC could be used in the Malaysia railway track. The crack at 138 kN occurred beyond the design load which is 82. 2 kN under the rail seat and at the mid span the tested load 101 kN is greater than design load of 52. 5 kN...|$|E

Despite superiority of these man-made composite sleepers, wooden sleepers still lead {{in terms of}} track performance qualities in particular on its natural elasticity. An initiative to investigate the degree of degradation of used wooden sleepers {{and the possibility of}} reusing them on low capacity railway track in Malaysia as a means of reducing the overall track rehabilitation cost was undertaken. Used wooden sleepers were tested according to Australian Standard, Railway Track Material, Prestressed Concrete Sleepers (AS 1085 : 14 : 2003) on Rail Seat <b>Vertical</b> <b>Load</b> <b>Test</b> and Centre Positive Bending Moment Test. Six wooden sleeper samples were tested under the static load until failure. Benchmarking was carried on high strength prestressed concrete sleeper, tested according to AS 1085 : 14 : 2003 : Rail Seat - Positive Moment Test. The results obtained showed the maximum load that the used wooden sleepers can carry surpassed the design load of KTMB specifications and it is about 58 % of high strength prestressed concrete sleeper. The maximum deflection produced by all used wooden sleepers is 20 mm showing that the sleepers maintained their elastic behaviour. Modulus of Elasticity ranging from 21 to 27 kN/mm 2 of which within the standard value, indicating weathering process does not so much affect their stiffness. Most sleepers showed crack patterns propagated in the longitudinal direction. Toughness value is almost one half of the high strength prestressed concrete sleeper. This study indicates that there is a potential of reusing the wooden sleepers for light loading of the railway track. Hence, an extensive study is recommended to be carried out under fatigue loading condition...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of fixed}} offshore platforms supported by pile foundations has encouraged {{the development of more}} rational methods of analysis of piles subjected combined axial and lateral loading. The combination of large lateral loads resulting from the action of wind, waves and currents in conjunction with vertical loads has created the need to analyze systems exposed to large inclined loads. [...] The scope of this thesis is to study the pile-soil interaction of a vertical flexible pile under inclined loadings in dense sand. To study the interaction, model flexible piles of 25 mm, 42 mm and 60 mm diameters were jacked into sand with controlled density. These model piles were instrumented with load-cells and strain-gauge bridges to measure the bending moment distributions. The piles were tested under vertical, horizontal and inclined loads using a computerized data acquisition system. A suitable soil container and laboratory test frame were assembled to conduct the tests. [...] The <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> results indicated that the value of the bearing capacity factor Nq was constant with depth and consistently smaller than that predicted by various existing theories. The results also indicated that the piles had a critical depth where the point resistance became constant with depth, at a pile diameter/depth ratio of about 20. [...] Experimental p-y curves were compared with those proposed by Reese et al (1974), Matlock et al (1980), Scott (1980) and Parker (1970). The test data indicate that the semi-empirical methods underestimate the ultimate resistance near the pile head and overestimate it at depth. Computed response of piles under test conditions showed good agreement with the measured response. [...] The ultimate load capacity under inclined load decreases with load inclination, with a rapid reduction for load inclinations between 45 and 90 degrees. Compared to a pile subjected to only lateral load, the vertical load on the pile increases the lateral deflections by about 4 to 15 %, and the maximum moment in the pile section by about 8 to 16 % for load inclinations from 60 to 30 degrees...|$|E

The {{oil and gas industry}} is targeting minimum facility applications, whilst the renewable energy sector is developing offshore wind turbines, {{as well as a number}} of wave and tidal energy devices. The design and installation of the foundations are key considerations in the financial viability of such offshore engineering projects. Suction caisson foundations are a potential solution for these new developments, but design guidance is relatively sparse. This paper considers the <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> response of a caisson foundation in clay, during installation and under both monotonic and cyclic <b>vertical</b> <b>loading.</b> The main contribution is the presentation and interpretation of high quality experimental data. <b>Vertical</b> <b>loading</b> is critical for the design of a multi-footing structure of the type that might be used for large offshore wind turbines.

40|$|A large {{excavated}} rectangular pile (barrette) with lateral {{earth pressure}} and pore-water pressure cells was successfully constructed and {{tested in a}} sequence of marine, alluvial, and weathered granite soils. A ``soft'' base formed beneath {{the bottom of the}} barrette permitted over 100 mm of Vertical settlement, completely mobilizing the shaft friction at the barrette-soil interface. During the <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> <b>tests,</b> an unusual and complex response of pore-water pressures and earth pressures at the barrette-soil interface was measured. During each <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> cycle (except the last one) and before interface slippage of the barrette occurred, excess positive pore-water pressures were recorded in all soil layers. Upon the initiation of slip at the barrette-soil interface, a sudden drop in the measured pore pressures as well as a substantial drop in lateral earth pressures generally resulted. Subsequent loading or unloading slippage events did not show the same dramatic behavior unless a period of consolidation/recovery was allowed first. This implies that caution must be used in design of barrettes relying heavily on skin friction when shearing induces contractive soil behavior. The current test results indicated that the empirical uncorrected SPT-N value approach and the effective stress beta-method were inconsistent...|$|R

As a newly introduced appendix to the International Residential Code (IRC), the strawbale construction requirements may benefit from further evaluation and possible refinement. Such evaluation and refinement may lead towards code change proposals that will improve the provisions and make strawbale construction safer and more accessible to the general public. This seismic test series addressed the effect of mesh wire type on ductility and {{the validity of the}} existing wall slenderness limits. The tests focused on slender walls dominated by flexural deformations. Welded wire mesh wall performed better than the woven wire mesh wall of the same detailing, yet fell short of expected values.

40|$|Geosystems often {{experience}} numerous loading cycles. Plastic strain accumulation during repetitive mechanical loads {{can lead}} to shear shakedown or continued shear ratcheting; in all cases, volumetric strains diminish as the specimen evolves towards terminal density. Previously suggested models and new functions are identified to fit plastic strain accumulation data. All accumulation models are formulated to capture terminal density (volumetric strain) and either shakedown or ratcheting (shear strain). Repetitive <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> <b>tests</b> under zero lateral strain conditions are conducted using three different sands packed at initially low and high densities. Test results show that plastic strain accumulation for all sands and density conditions can be captured in the same dimensionless plot {{defined in terms of}} the initial relative density, terminal density, and ratio between the amplitude of the repetitive load and the initial static load.

40|$|The lack of {{knowledge}} about the behaviour of footings for jack-up rigs under storm loads poses a design problem which can be tackled by model testing. The areas of prime concern are the ultimate loads on footings under combined loading, which affects the safety of the rig, and the rotational stiffness, which affects the interaction between the foundation and the structure. A programme of <b>loading</b> <b>tests</b> was performed on model footings on clay, and was divided into two stages: monotonic loading and cyclic loading. The clay samples were obtained by consolidating Speswhite kaolin slurry in cylindrical tanks 450 mm in diameter. The strength and compressibility characteristics of the samples were verified by means of standard laboratory tests. The model footings were 50 mm and 100 mm in diameter and several shapes were tested: circular flat plate, cones of various angles and model spud-cans. Loads and displacements were monitored using appropriate instrumentation and a data logger. A series of central <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> <b>tests</b> provided data for comparison with existing bearing capacity theories. Combined <b>loading</b> <b>tests</b> were performed applying a displacement controlled horizontal load at a fixed height above the footing which was also subjected to a fixed <b>vertical</b> <b>load.</b> The main series of tests involved a parametric study of the relevant variables. Special tests allowed the assessment of the effect of embedment of the footing and the interaction of a flexible leg with the foundation.

40|$|Suction {{caissons}} {{are a new}} foundation {{option for}} offshore wind turbines. This thesis is focussed on the behaviour of suction caisson foundations in sand and in clay during installation, and under subsequent vertical and combined moment-lateral loadings. The research is based on extensive experimental work carried out using model scaled caissons. The analysis of the results allowed the determination of parameters for hyperplasticity models. Model caissons were vertically loaded in loose and dense sands to study in service states and plastic behaviour. Bearing capacity increased with {{the length of the}} caisson skirt. The bearing capacity formulation showed that the angle of friction mobilised was close to the critical state value for loose sands and close to those of peak values due to dilation for dense sands. The <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> increased, though at a lower rate than during initial penetration, after large plastic displacements occurred. A hardening law formulation including this observed behaviour is suggested. In sand the installation of caissons by suction showed a drastic reduction in the net <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> required to penetrate the caisson into the ground compared with that required to install caissons by pushing. This occurred due to the hydraulic gradients created by the suction. The theoretical formulations of the yield surface and flow rule were calibrated from the results of moment <b>loading</b> <b>tests</b> under low constant <b>vertical</b> <b>loads.</b> The fact that caissons exhibit moment capacity under tension loads was considered in the yield surface formulation. Results from symmetric and non symmetric cyclic moment <b>loading</b> <b>tests</b> showed that Masing’s rules were obeyed. Fully drained conditions, partially drained and undrained conditions were studied. Caisson rotation velocities scaled in the laboratory to represent those in the field induced undrained response for relevant periods of wave loading, a wide range of seabed permeabilities and prototype caisson dimensions. Under undrained conditions and low constant <b>vertical</b> <b>loads</b> the moment capacity of suction caissons was very small. Under partially drained conditions the moment capacity decreased with the increase of excess pore pressure. In clay, <b>vertical</b> cyclic <b>loading</b> around a mean <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> of zero showed that in the short term the negative excess pore pressures generated during suction installation reduced vertical displacements. The yield surface and the flow rule were determined from moment swipe and constant <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> <b>tests.</b> The moment capacity was found to depend on the ratio between the preload Vo and the ultimate bearing capacity Vu. Gapping response was observed during cyclic moment <b>loading</b> <b>tests,</b> but starting at smaller normalised rotations than in the field. The hysteresis loop shape obtained during gapping cannot be reproduced by means of the Masing’s rules. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Vertical</b> static <b>load</b> <b>test</b> {{is widely}} used in the {{determination}} of pile bearing capacity, the mathematical model used to fit test pile data in determining the bearing capacity is essential. From the perspective of analytic geometry, the paper analyzes the traditional method of hyperbola, of which the asymptotic line of equilateral hyperbola {{was used to determine}} the ultimate bearing capacity. By extending the equal-axed conditions, a more general form of hyperbolic equation is derived and feasibility of such method is also analyzed, which indicates that the maximum point of curvature in such hyperbolic curve can determine the ultimate bearing capacity and such method is proved to be reasonable in practical projects...|$|R

Since 1997, investigations at Kinnegar have included lateral <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> on single piles (Phillips 2002) and <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> (both static and cyclic) on single piles and small pile groups (reported in this Thesis). Extensive site investigation data {{has also been}} assimilated over this period. <b>Vertical</b> <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out single reference piles and groups of five piles (centre to corner spacing of s/B= 3). Each precast concrete driven pile was 250 mm square and with an embedded length of 6 m, much of its load was carried in shaft friction. Some of these piles contained internal instruments allowing load distributions and horizontal total stresses to be estimated. Slow static <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> (in tension and compression, for single piles and groups) were of the maintained load type with a final displacement rate of 0. 24 mm/hour for each load increment. One-way cyclic tension tests (on single piles and groups) were carried out {{at a rate of}} 1 cycle/minute for between 180 and 550 cycles. There are two distinct facets to group action in driven piles: (i) the effect of neighbouring installations and (ii) the effect of loading adjacent piles. Both effects are likely to determine how the load-displacement relationship of a pile within a group differs from that of an isolated single or reference pile. It is commonly assumed that the soil surrounding any group pile is stiffened due to adjacent piling (i. e. its shear modulus increases) leading to improved individual performance under load. However, although the maximum excess pore pressures and total stress associated with group installation are higher than for a single pile, these are transient and return to original values very quickly. In fact, total stresses immediately after the installation of a five-pile group fall below those expected for a single pile. Upon full equalization of horizontal effective stresses, the value for the group appears to fall slightly below that expected for a single pile. This suggests that adjacent pile installation may have a small negative effect on subsequent pile performance. Independent data also suggests either a neutral or small negative installation effect. Group action in Belfast soft clay appears to be governed predominantly by the load transferred between group piles when under <b>load.</b> <b>Tests</b> on tension and compression fivepile groups (s/B= 3) are consistent in indicating that on average, the stiffness of the group is typically ? 45 % that of a single pile at a typical working load per pile 1 (alternatively, the group has displaced by over twice the amount of a single pile). The relative stiffnesses of the centre and corner piles (corresponding to a working load per pile) are more difficult to determine due to inconsistent pile cap flexibility; nevertheless the centre pile is typically ? 65 %- 85 % as stiff as a corner pile at any stage 2 of group loading. While relative pile capacities depend upon the flexibility of the pile-cap, the ultimate load in the centre pile falls 25 - 30 % below that of a single pile for a rigidly capped group. A <b>load</b> <b>test</b> on one group pile (with settlement measurements on adjacent non-loaded piles) proved instructive. It provided data to show that non-linear superposition (of displacements) is unsuitable for predicting the response of closely spaced piles but may be acceptable when widely spaced. The importance of choosing non-linear soil models is emphasized, as linear elastic ?interaction factors? grossly overestimate the amount of load transferred between piles and may lead to inefficient piling solutions. This data also contributed {{to the development of a}} trendline relating the stiffness efficiency to the pile spacing/width ratio (s/B), a useful design guide for small groups of the Belfast configuration. Its use in tandem with a suitable indication of the cost of constructing a capped group indicates that the economy of the solution is relatively insensitive to spacing in the range 4 B 2) causes little cyclic degradation. Failure in one-way cyclic tension is governed by the accumulation of mean pile head displacements and is not amplitude-driven...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results from}} the experimental testing of load-bearing timber–glass composite shear walls and beams. Shear wall specimens measuring 1200 [*]×[*] 2400  mm 2 manufactured with three adhesives of varying stiffness were tested. Twelve specimens with a single 10  mm thick glass pane and one specimen with an additional insulating glass unit were produced. The testing procedures involved various <b>loading</b> conditions: pure <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> and different combinations of shear and <b>vertical</b> <b>loading.</b> The <b>test</b> {{results showed that the}} adhesive had only a minor influence on the buckling load which was the main failure mechanism. 240  mm high and 4800  mm long timber–glass beams manufactured with adhesives of different stiffness were tested. For the webs, two types of glass were used: annealed float and heat-strengthened glass, in both cases 8  mm thick panes were used. In total, 12 beams were tested in four-point bending until failure. Despite the considerable difference in adhesive stiffness, beam bending stiffness was similar. Concerning load-bearing capacity, the beams with heat-strengthened glass were approximately 50 % stronger than the beams made using annealed float glass...|$|R

Repeated <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out with different initial monotonic load levels to simulate structures in which live loads change slowly and repeatedly such as petroleum tanks and ship repair tracks. Three series of tests were carried out. Tests of series 1 were performed to determine the ultimate monotonic bearing capacity. Tests of series 2 were performed on unreinforced sand under <b>vertical</b> repeated <b>loads.</b> <b>Tests</b> of series 3 were performed to study the effect of sand reinforcement on the footing response under the same loads. The studied parameters include the initial monotonic load levels, the number of load cycles, and the relative density of sand along with geosynthetic parameters including size and number of layers. Both the ultimate bearing load and the cumulative settlement were obtained and analyzed...|$|R

The principal parameters investigated were the arch geometry; arch ring thickness; area and distribution of reinforcement; type of inter-ring shear reinforcement and mortar strength. In each case a full width line load was applied incrementally to the upper surface of the arch at quarter span until collapse occurred. In all cases, longitudinal reinforcement was found to delay the onset of cracking and to increase the load carrying capacity.

Longitudinal reinforcement was found to be the most effective when used with measures to prevent ring separation...|$|R
40|$|The use of Steel Fiber Reinforced Concrete (SFRC) in columns was {{experimentally}} {{evaluated with}} the aim of reducing the stirrups spacing without compromising the columns seismic behavior in terms of drift capacity and dissipation energy. Results from eight RC columns and eight SFRC ones are reported. The columns were reinforced with hooked steel fibers with a volume fraction of 1. 0 %, subjected to earthquake-induced displacement reversals and constant axial loads. The spacing and the diameter of the stirrups were varied in order to verify their influence, moreover mono-axial and bi-axial quasi-static tests were performed by keeping constant the <b>vertical</b> <b>load.</b> The <b>tests</b> results confirmed that SFRC can reliably reduce the damage by preventing the concrete cover to spall out at earlier stages and increase the initial stiffness and the energy dissipation of the columns, especially for mono-axial loads that resulted a less severe load condition with respect to the bi-axial one. Nevertheless, it seems that, despite the fibers addition, the increased spacing reduces the columns ductility...|$|R
