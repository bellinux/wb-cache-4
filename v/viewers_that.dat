Dries believes that the progression of the show demonstrates that Lex earned Lana's love. To answer <b>viewers</b> <b>that</b> hated to see Lana marry Lex, Dries contends that as viewers we are seeing all of Lex, including how evil he truly is, while Lana only sees the portion of Lex that appears good.|$|E
