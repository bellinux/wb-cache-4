5|$|During the game's development, {{the team}} lacked artists. The art {{director}} at Epic Games, Shane Caudle, and the artists at Digital Extremes {{could not make}} enough new textures because {{of the amount of}} diversity in characters and maps. In order to supplement the skin and texture production, Epic turned to contract artist Steve Garofalo. The game's level and content management program, UnrealEd, was written in <b>Visual</b> <b>Basic</b> and considered buggy, but no one had time to fix it. The game engine had an object-oriented design, and the scripting language, UnrealScript, was considered to be more like Java. The modularity of the object-oriented design meant that programmers could make large changes without affecting other parts of the game. Other tools used during development included Microsoft Visual Studio and 3D Studio Max. All of the weapon sound effects were created by Sonic Mayhem. The soundtrack for the game, which employed the system of module files, was written by Alexander Brandon, Michiel van den Bos, Andrew Sega, Dan Gardopee and Peter Hajba.|$|E

40|$|Excellent {{graphics}} are {{the instruments}} used for representing quantitative information. Graphics help {{people to understand}} complex things easily. Hence the user interfaces developed should be clear, illustrative and designed from the user point of view {{with respect to their}} applications. The thesis work deals with the design of a graphical user interface (GUI) developed for a home energy monitoring system. Design methodologies like user centric design and empathic design are followed while creating the user interface and also the effect of various colors on human perception is studied. Hence the final design of user interface provides the end-users a visualization of the energy produced and consumed in a monitored environment. The monitoring devices are connected to ThereGate system (data logger) via the M-Bus communication protocol. The ThereGate platform uses an Open Source Linux system as the operating language. The other communication platform used over the ThereGate platform is an oBIX bridge, a web based service interface rich in XML support for transferring the data. The interface has been programmed by using <b>Visual</b> <b>basics</b> 2008 and VB. NET, developed by Microsoft. The work progresses with an initial explanation on the availability of various home energy monitoring systems on the market and their comparison. The other units discuss the architecture of the ThereGate system, give a brief overview of the M-bus system, and discuss the development of graphical user interface (GUI) from a user centric design perspective using Microsoft's <b>Visual</b> <b>Basics</b> and VB.
