40|$|Atmospheric {{monitoring}} systems (AMS) are required when using air from conveyor belt entries to <b>ventilate</b> <b>working</b> <b>sections</b> in U. S. underground coal mines. AMS technology {{has the potential}} to increase fire safety mine-wide, but {{research is needed to determine}} the detection and response times for fires of a variety of combustible materials. To evaluate the potential of an AMS for fire detection in other areas of a coal mine, a series of full-scale fire experiments were conducted to determine detection and response times from fires of different combustible materials that are found in U. S. underground coal mines, including high- and low-volatility coals, conveyor belts, brattice materials, different types of wood, diesel fuel, and a foam sealant. These experiments were conducted in the Safety Research Coal Mine (SRCM) of the U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) located in Pittsburgh, PA, using a commercially available AMS that is typical of current technology. The results showed that through proper selection of sensors and their locations, a mine-wide AMS can provide sufficient early fire warning times and improve the health and safety of miners.

The Belt Air Rule included a requirement dictating compatibility of air velocity with fire suppression systems. The final rule of limiting air velocity in the belt entry was challenged in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

The removal of the air velocity cap from the final rule, paired with the compatibility requirement, led to a need for research on high air velocity 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s influence on fire suppression system performance in belt entries.

40|$|A {{scheme for}} {{reducing}} dynamic interference in wind tunnels at subsonic and transonic speeds was {{tested in a}} pilot 4 in × 4 in tunnel.

When solid walls are present in the <b>working</b> <b>section</b> of test rigs and wind tunnels, acoustic modes can readily be excited in the <b>working</b> <b>sections</b> without he knowledge of experimenters and can lead to an erroneous interpretation of test results. Examples of the interaction between loud sounds, up to 150 dB, and the flow are described.

Recent experiments at CSIRO show that sound levels between 70 and 95 dB (with corresponding ratios of the velocity due to sound to the freestream velocity of between ~ 0. 0001 and, ~ 0. 002) generated by the flow can alter both the flow and the heat ransfer characteristics in a manner not immediately obvious to the experimenter.
