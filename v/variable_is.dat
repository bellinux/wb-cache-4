When the logarithm of a random variable has a normal distribution, the <b>variable</b> <b>is</b> {{said to have}} a log-normal distribution. Log-normal distributions are encountered in many fields, wherever a <b>variable</b> <b>is</b> formed {{as the product of}} many independent positive random variables, for example in the study of turbulence.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} a clause in {{which one of the}} clause's two {{variables}} has already been set, and the clause could still become either true or false, then the other <b>variable</b> <b>is</b> set in a way that forces the clause to become true.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble assumption {{can introduce}} {{variability in the}} decompression outcome through the lung function. The first <b>variable</b> <b>is</b> individual susceptibility. The filtering capacity of the lung may be assumed to vary between individuals, and for a given individual, from day to day, and {{may account for the}} inter-personal and intra-persona variability which have been observed in DCS susceptibility. Basically, a good diver is a good bubble filter. This is a justification for divers who seek top physical fitness for severe decompression exposures.|$|E

5|$|For graphs G and H, the {{question}} of whether G has a homomorphism to H corresponds to a CSP instance with only one kind of constraint, as follows. The variables are the vertices of G and the domain for each <b>variable</b> <b>is</b> the vertex set of H. An evaluation is a function that assigns to each variable an element of the domain, so a function f from V(G) to V(H). Each edge or arc (u,v) of G then corresponds to the constraint ((u,v), E(H)). This is a constraint expressing that the evaluation should map the arc (u,v) to a pair (f(u),f(v)) that is in the relation E(H), that is, to an arc of H. A solution to the CSP is an evaluation that respects all constraints, so it is exactly a homomorphism from G to H.|$|E
25|$|Step 1: Identify {{the primary}} breath control variable. If {{inspiration}} {{starts with a}} preset inspiratory pressure, or if pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort, then the control <b>variable</b> <b>is</b> pressure.

50|$|Within each latent class, the {{observed}} <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> statistically independent. This {{is an important}} aspect. Usually {{the observed}} <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> statistically dependent.
