5|$|Before {{the start}} of Yao's sophomore season, Rockets' head coach Rudy Tomjanovich {{resigned}} because of health issues, and long-time New York Knicks head coach Jeff <b>Van</b> <b>Gundy</b> was brought in. After <b>Van</b> <b>Gundy</b> began focusing the offense on Yao, Yao averaged career highs in points and rebounds for the season, and had a career-high 41points and 7assists in a triple-overtime win against the Atlanta Hawks in February 2004.

5|$|During {{his time}} as an All-Star, McGrady was {{frequently}} criticized for not having led any team beyond {{the first round of}} the playoffs. Some analysts have defended McGrady, feeling that he was the victim of bad rosters and unfortunate circumstances. His effort level, leadership, and toughness were also questioned at times. In response to these criticisms, former Rockets coach Jeff <b>Van</b> <b>Gundy</b> described McGrady as a poor practice player but praised his coachability, unselfishness, and ability to perform well in big games.|$|E
5|$|The 2003–04 season {{marked the}} Rockets' arrival {{to a new}} arena, the Toyota Center, a {{redesign}} of their uniforms and logo, and their first season without Rudy Tomjanovich, who resigned as head coach after being diagnosed with bladder cancer.

25|$|In {{the second}} round of the playoffs against the {{defending}} champions Boston, the Magic blew a lead in Game 5 and Howard publicly questioned coach Stan <b>Van</b> <b>Gundy's</b> tactics and said that he should be given the ball more; in Game 6, the center posted 23 points and 22 rebounds to force the series into seven games.

5|$|In the offseason, Houston saw {{major changes}} in the roster as the Rockets {{acquired}} Tracy McGrady in a seven-player deal with the Orlando Magic. The scoring champion McGrady and the strong rebounder Yao formed a well-regarded pair that helped the Rockets win 22 consecutive games in the 2007–08 NBA season, which was at the time the 3rd longest winning streak in NBA history. Still, the duo was plagued with injuries – of the 463 regular season games for which they were teammates, Yao missed 146 and McGrady 160 – and did not win any playoff series, despite gathering leads over the Dallas Mavericks in 2005 and the Jazz in 2007. After the 2007 elimination, <b>Van</b> <b>Gundy</b> was fired, and the Rockets hired Rick Adelman to replace him.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, {{after an}} injury-plagued {{year in which}} McGrady and Yao missed a total of 70 games, the team finished with only 34 wins, and missed the playoffs. The Rockets improved by 18 games the next year, with 52 wins, but once again lost {{in the first round}} after leading 2–0, when they lost in seven games to Utah. After the loss, <b>Van</b> <b>Gundy</b> was fired, and the Rockets hired Rick Adelman to replace him. In the following year, despite Yao suffering a season-ending injury for the third year in a row, the Rockets won 22 consecutive games, which is the second longest winning streak in NBA history. This streak included going 13-0 in the month of February, making them the first team since the 1996 Chicago Bulls to finish an entire month undefeated.

He had previously asked to be traded to the New Jersey Nets, and the Magic were prepared to trade him had Howard not signed the amendment, to avoid losing him as a free agent.

25|$|The Orlando Magic {{started the}} 2007–08 season with new coach Stan <b>Van</b> <b>Gundy,</b> and Arroyo again {{was at the}} backup point guard position. On November 28, 2007, he had a career-high 14 assists {{in a game against}} the Seattle SuperSonics. On December 29, 2007, Arroyo was {{promoted}} to the starting position after Nelson experienced an extended offensive slump. With Nelson in the starting position during this period the team was having an average of seventeen turnovers per game, and he was unable to score in double digits on 10 out of 17 games. This led to <b>Van</b> <b>Gundy</b> issuing several public notices concerning the team's performance eventually leading to changes in the starting formation. During Arroyo's first three games in the starting position the number of turnovers produced by the team was lowered to eleven per game. Arroyo's points average was within double digits in all of these games and he recorded seventeen assists.

25|$|After {{finishing}} the 2002–03 season 25–57, to fully dedicate {{his attention to}} his duties as general manager, Riley stepped down as head coach and was succeeded by longtime assistant Stan <b>Van</b> <b>Gundy.</b> <b>Van</b> <b>Gundy</b> and rookie Dwyane Wade, whom Riley drafted 5th overall, led the Heat back into the playoffs with a 42–40 record after starting 0–7. Riley concentrated on improving the team even further before the 2004–2005 season. One of his biggest moves as full-time general manager was to trade Caron Butler, Brian Grant, Lamar Odom and a first-round draft pick to the Lakers for Shaquille O'Neal. O'Neal had just come off a successful stint with the Phil Jackson-coached Lakers winning three straight championships 2000–02 and a 2004 Finals loss. By this time, Riley and Jackson's feud had cooled. Wade and O'Neal led the Heat to the Eastern Conference finals during the 2005 playoffs, although they lost to the defending champions Detroit Pistons after being up 3–2 in the series. Wade had missed game 6 entirely due to injury.|$|E

25|$|Four players {{missed the}} game: Kobe Bryant, Chris Paul and Brandon Roy due to injury; Allen Iverson due to {{personal}} reasons.

Wade won the Finals MVP award.|$|E
25|$|On Memorial Day, 2003, Brown {{abruptly}} resigned as head coach, {{taking over the}} reins in Detroit a few days later. Brown's Pistons would win the 2004 NBA Championship over the Los Angeles Lakers, in some ways avenging his loss to them in 2001. After being turned down by Jeff <b>Van</b> <b>Gundy</b> and Eddie Jordan, the 76ers hired Randy Ayers, an assistant under Brown, as their new head coach.
