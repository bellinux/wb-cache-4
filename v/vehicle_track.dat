40|$|<b>Vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> plays more {{important}} roles in modern transportation and logistics operation. This paper deals with {{a new approach to}} <b>track</b> <b>vehicles</b> based on RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> system is designed overallly  supported by Axiomatic Design theory. The basic steps of <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> based on RFID are developed and a six-layered architecture for the <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> system integrating databases, RFID tags, RFID readers, data centers, networks and user interface is presented, where the positions of vehicles are attained directly by compared the RFID readers collecting vehicle RFID tags their position information in the database. It is shown that this <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> method uses RFID more fully, the architecture with clear levels, adapts to the future technical and practical requirements, and can help fuse more complicated applications like intelligent charging and cargo tracking. </p...|$|R
50|$|<b>Vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> {{systems are}} also popular in {{consumer}} vehicles as a theft prevention, monitoring and retrieval device. Police can simply follow the signal emitted by the tracking system and locate the stolen vehicle. When used as a security system, a <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Tracking</b> System may serve as either an addition to or replacement for a traditional car alarm. Some <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> systems {{make it possible to}} control the vehicle remotely, including block doors or engine in case of emergency.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> {{processes}} are very computationally intensive. Traditionally, <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> algorithms have been implemented using software approaches. The software approaches have a large computational delay, which causes low frame rate <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking.</b> However, real-time <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> is highly desirable to improve not only tracking accuracy but also response time, in some ITS (Intelligent Transportation System) applications such as security monitoring and hazard warning. For this purpose, this project proposes a hardware based <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> system for real-time high frame rate tracking. The proposed tracking algorithm is based on motion estimation by full-search block matching algorithm. Motion estimation is implemented in a hardware processor, which could significantly reduce the computational delay compared to traditional software approaches. In this project, the hardware processor is first designed and verified using Cadence software in CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) IBM 0. 13 μm technology, and then mapped to the Xilinx Spartan- 3 A DSP Development Board for quick implementation. Test results have shown the hardware processor functions correctly with sequences of traffic images. We also design the algorithms to post-process the motion vectors output from the hardware processor to complete the overall <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> process...|$|R

Therefore, <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> system is needed to reduce this risk. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> system is a system’s {{combination}} that installed in the vehicle so that can be tracked by the owner or the third part. Modern <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> system usually use GPS to determine vehicle’s location.

In this Final Project, the <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> tool based on GPS via celluler will be created. This tool {{is a part of}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> system. This tool will respond a command which is sent by tracker via SMS. The device contains of three parts.

All of these parts will cooperate to process all of the messages sent by tracker. Then server will get information about position in form of longitude, latitude, date and time.
