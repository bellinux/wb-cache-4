The articles, written by {{experts on the}} subject, summarize the situation in various (mainly European) countries and the evaluation procedures and criteria for international institutions (Codex Alimentarius, IFOAM Basic Standards). This volume of proceedings was produced {{as part of a}} workshop of the European funded Project ‘Organic Inputs Evaluation’.

The degree of phytotoxicity is expressed by ([...] P_iQ_i)/∑ P_iQ_i * UAA, where Q indicates the quantities of plant <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> and P the weight associated with the class of toxicity, with P =  3 for class I, P =  2 for class II, P =  1 for classes III-IV, and P =  0 for non-toxic plant <b>protection</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} new {{proposals}} for the aquatic effects assessment of plant <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> (pesticides) in the Netherlands are described for edge-of-field surface waters (drainage ditches) falling under {{the domain of}} the Plant <b>Protection</b> <b>Product</b> Regulation (pre-registration) and for water bodies falling under {{the domain of the}} Water Framework Directive (post-registration). These methods are developed on request of two Dutch ministries (Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation; Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment). They are based on specific protection goals proposed by the responsible risk managers of the Dutch ministries, the current European aquatic risk assessment procedures for plant <b>protection</b> <b>products,</b> state-of-the-art knowledge on the ecotoxicology of these chemicals and different aims/claims of the Plant <b>Protection</b> <b>Product</b> Regulation (1107 / 2009 /EC) and the Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC) ...|$|R

40|$|Registration {{of plant}} <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> {{involves}} {{the analysis of}} their effects on soil microorganisms. The residues of plant <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> penetrate the soil, but their impact on fungi remains scarcely researched. In this study, the influence of selected plant <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> on the abundance of rhizosphere-dwelling fungi {{and the growth of}} winter wheat seedlings was evaluated under greenhouse conditions. The analysed plant <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> had an inhibitory effect on the growth of filamentous fungi in the rhizosphere, whereas yeasts were resistant to those products applied to soil. Tebuconazole exerted the strongest suppressive effect on the growth of filamentous fungi, and propiconazole was characterized by the greatest phytotoxic activity against winter wheat seedlings. Azoxystrobin had the weakest ecotoxic and phytotoxic effects, and its application to soil usually led to a rapid increase in the counts of fungi of the genus Acremonium...|$|R
30|$|As yet, {{far less}} data for {{biocides}} {{in the environment}} are available in comparison with plant <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> and pharmaceuticals. New data can create pressure on policy makers for {{a level playing field}} in, e.g., regulating biocides and plant <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> with equivalent <b>protection</b> goals. The Directive 2009 / 128 /EC on the “sustainable use of pesticides” [75] adopts an overarching approach to reduce the overall risks and impacts of pesticides on environment and health. The German Environment Ministry emphasized that new monitoring data for biocides can help to achieve a protection level comparable to the sustainable use law for plant <b>protection</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R

40|$|New {{legislation}} {{emphasizes the}} importance of proper disposal of the residues of plant <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> in farms in the agricultural and horticultural sector, because some of those residues may remain in soil in unchanged form for several years, thus affecting the biodiversity of soil microorganisms. A questionnaire survey was conducted to determine the methods of application and disposal of plant <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> by professional users. Biodiversity of microbial communities in soil at sites contaminated by xenobiotics from point sources was evaluated in a laboratory experiment. The awareness of the users of plant <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> regarding responsible and safe use of approved sprayers and the need to train persons performing protective treatments was satisfactory. However, the respondents demonstrated a low level of environmental awareness, and they often declared that in their farms the residues of plant <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> are disposed of in the same place repeatedly. Such practices reduce the biodiversity of soil-dwelling microbes, in particular, the counts of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. In most cases, fungi of the genus Mucor and the species of Fusarium culmorum and Gliocladium roseum did not respond to the presence of the residues of plant <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> in soil...|$|R

40|$|EFSA has {{a number}} of panels. The Panel on Plant <b>Protection</b> <b>Products</b> and their Residues (PPR) is about plant <b>protection</b> <b>products.</b> It deals with three {{different}} types of questions: 1. Questions from the EFSA (related to the assessment of compounds) 2. Questions from the Panel (self tasking) 3. Questions from the European Commission About EFSA and bees The centrepiece of the Authority’s work in this area is a guidance document on the risk assessment of plant <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> on bees (Apis mellifera, Bombus spp. and solitary bees), which will be published this year 2012 (see attachment below). EFSA’s advice was requested by the European Commission in 2011 after members of the European Parliament and beekeeper associations voiced concerns about the appropriateness of the current risk assessment scheme. The guidance will be preceded by another important document: an opinion on the science behind the development of a risk assessment of plant <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> on bees, which will be completed by the end of April o...|$|R

Its development has be-come necessary in the context of Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009 concerning the placing of plant <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> on the market of the European Community. Even though the criteria developed and the data set used as a basis for toxicological analysis of such substances are considered to be specific for plant <b>protection</b> <b>products,</b> it is recognized that a guidance document once developed might also have implications for other classes of substances such as biocides or chemicals under REACh.
