5|$|The female banded sea kraits {{then lay}} {{as many as}} 10 eggs per clutch. The eggs are {{deposited}} in crevices where they remain until hatching. These eggs are <b>very</b> <b>rarely</b> found in the wild; only two nests have been definitively reported throughout {{the entire range of}} the species.|$|E
50|$|Dicoria calliptera has {{spreading}} branches up to 50 cm (20 inches) long. Leaves are egg-shaped, <b>very</b> small, <b>rarely</b> {{more than}} 15 mm (0.6 inches) long. One plant can produce many small flower heads.|$|R
50|$|The Shelley's eagle-owl (Bubo shelleyi) is {{a species}} of owl in the family Strigidae. Despite its large size, it is a <b>very</b> little-known, <b>rarely</b> studied owl that seems to occur in very small numbers.|$|R
50|$|Allium lineare has {{one or two}} bulbs each up to 15 cm across. Scape is up to 60 cm tall. Leaves are flat, {{shorter than}} the scape, <b>very</b> narrow, <b>rarely</b> more than 5 mm across. Flowers red.|$|R
5|$|Western jackdaws hatch asynchronously and {{incubation}} begins before clutch completion, {{which often}} leads {{to the death of}} the last-hatched young. If the supply of food is low, parental investment in the brood is kept to a minimum as little energy is wasted on feeding a chick that is unlikely to survive. Replacement clutches are <b>very</b> <b>rarely</b> laid in the event of clutch failure.|$|E
5|$|In most {{of their}} range, egg laying begins in late February. In colder climates, it is later, e.g. April in Greenland and Tibet. In Pakistan, {{egg-laying}} takes place in December. Eggs and hatchlings are preyed on, rarely, by large hawks and eagles, large owls, martens and canids. The adults, which are <b>very</b> <b>rarely</b> predated, are often successful in defending their young from these predators, due to their numbers, large size and cunning. They have been observed dropping stones on potential predators that venture close to their nests.|$|E
5|$|Males {{tend to take}} tits, finches, sparrows and buntings; females {{often take}} thrushes and starlings. Larger quarry (such as doves and magpies) may not die {{immediately}} but succumb during feather plucking and eating. More than 120 bird species have been recorded as prey and individual Eurasian sparrowhawks may specialise in certain prey. The birds taken are usually adults or fledglings, though chicks in the nest and carrion are sometimes eaten. Small mammals, including bats, are sometimes caught but insects are eaten only <b>very</b> <b>rarely.</b>|$|E

5|$|Schmeisser helped {{organize}} and {{played on the}} Mount Washington Lacrosse Club, a highly successful Baltimore-based amateur team. Since there was no professional league, many former college lacrosse stars played for Mount Washington. The club regularly participated in exhibition games against the top intercollegiate programs and <b>very</b> <b>rarely</b> lost. In 1904, Schmeisser and Abercrombie co-authored Lacrosse: From Candidate to Team, a book which became the sport's standard text for the next fifty years. He also helped promote lacrosse at the University of Maryland and the Naval Academy.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{store their}} entire genomes {{in the form}} of RNA, and contain no DNA at all. Because they use RNA to store genes, their {{cellular}} hosts may synthesize their proteins as soon as they are infected and without the delay in waiting for transcription. On the other hand, RNA retroviruses, such as HIV, require the reverse transcription of their genome from RNA into DNA before their proteins can be synthesized. RNA-mediated epigenetic inheritance has also been observed in plants and <b>very</b> <b>rarely</b> in animals.|$|E
5|$|The spores of Myxogastria are haploid, mainly {{round and}} measure between 5µm and 20µm, rarely up to 24µm in diameter. Their surface is {{generally}} reticular, sharp, warty or spiky and <b>very</b> <b>rarely</b> smooth. The typical colour of the spore mass becomes {{visible through the}} structure, since the spores themselves are not pigmented. In some species, especially of the genus Badhamia, the spores produce lumps. The colour, shape and diameter of spores are important characteristics for identifying species.|$|E
5000|$|Marikina {{features}} a tropical monsoon climate. Its {{proximity to the}} equator means that the temperature range is <b>very</b> small, <b>rarely</b> going lower than [...] or higher than [...] However, humidity levels are usually very high, which makes it feel much warmer.

5|$|Throughout the goldcrest's range, {{the main}} {{predator}} of small woodland birds is the Eurasian sparrowhawk, {{which has a}} diet consisting of up to 98% of birds. Merlins, tawny and long-eared owls also hunt goldcrests. The erratic movements and flights of small woodland birds, which are vulnerable to attack while away from cover, may help to confuse their predators. The goldcrest has only <b>very</b> <b>rarely</b> been recorded as a host of the common cuckoo, a widespread European brood parasite.|$|E
5|$|<b>Very</b> <b>rarely</b> (about 1 in 10,000 conchs), a conch pearl may {{be found}} within the mantle. Though they occur {{in a range of}} colors {{corresponding}} to the colors of the interior of the shell, pink specimens are the most valuable. These pearls are considered semi-precious, and a popular tourist curio. The best specimens have been used to create necklaces and earrings. A conch pearl is a non-nacreous pearl (formerly referred to by some sources as a 'calcareous concretion') which differs from most pearls that are sold as gemstones.|$|E
5|$|<b>Very</b> <b>rarely,</b> {{female worker}} bees lay eggs that escape worker policing, {{in a process}} known as the anarchic syndrome. Female {{reproductive}} workers in these colonies activate their ovaries even {{in the presence of a}} queen. The worker eggs are allowed as they mimic queen hydrocarbons. Thus, female workers can maximize their reproductive fitness at the expense of the colony. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at individual and group levels.|$|E
5|$|Under the Köppen climate {{classification}} system, Manila has {{a tropical}} savanna climate (Köppen climate classification Aw). Together {{with the rest}} of the Philippines, Manila lies entirely within the tropics. Its proximity to the equator means that the temperature range is <b>very</b> small, <b>rarely</b> going below 20°C or above 38°C. Temperature extremes have ranged from 14.5°C on January 11, 1914, to 38.6°C on May 7, 1915.|$|R

The bark is used for tanning leather and dying orange color. It is appreciated as ornamental and fruit-producing tree. Planted trees in northern California have done <b>very</b> well. <b>Rarely</b> seen in Spain, it has adapted perfectly in that country.|$|R
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases the amount of air in the chest increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, it can result in death. <b>Very</b> <b>rarely</b> both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis.|$|E
5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge <b>very</b> <b>rarely,</b> at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E
5|$|An insect {{survey in}} September 2009 {{recorded}} 187 beetle species, including two new to Norfolk, the rove beetle Phytosus nigriventris and the fungus beetle Leiodes ciliaris, and two <b>very</b> <b>rarely</b> {{seen in the}} county, the sap beetle Nitidula carnaria and the clown beetle Gnathoncus nanus. There were also 24 types of spider, and the five ant species included the nationally rare Myrmica specioides. The rare millipede Thalassisobates littoralis, a specialist of coastal shingle habitats, was found here in 1972, and a red-veined darter appeared in 2012. Tens of thousands of migrant turnip sawflies were recorded {{for a few days}} in late summer 2006, along with red-eyed damselflies. The silver Y moth also appears in large numbers in some years.|$|E

50|$|X-23 is <b>very</b> taciturn, <b>rarely</b> uttering {{more than}} one {{sentence}} or two at a time. Because {{she grew up in}} a controlled environment, she speaks using perfect grammar, rarely using slang. She also engages in self-injury, cutting herself with her own claws; this is something she has done since a very young age. X-23 is a highly trained and skilled combatant; she is able to kill dozens of heavily armed opponents during a single encounter.|$|R
50|$|Agami herons stalk {{their prey}} (fish, frogs, small reptiles, and snails) in shallow shaded water in forested areas. They often standi still on perches or {{directly}} in the water, or moving <b>very</b> slowly. They <b>rarely</b> wade in open water.|$|R
5|$|Black-shouldered kites live almost {{exclusively}} on mice, and have become a specialist predator of house mice, often following outbreaks of mouse plagues in rural areas. They take other suitably sized creatures when available, including grasshoppers, rats, small reptiles, birds, and even (<b>very</b> <b>rarely)</b> rabbits, but mice and other mouse-sized mammals account for over 90% of their diet. Their influence on mouse populations is probably significant: adults take two or three mice a day each if they can, around a thousand mice a year. On one occasion, a male was observed bringing no less than 14 mice to a nest of well-advanced fledglings within an hour. In another study, a female kite was seen to struggle back to fledglings in the nest with a three-quarters grown rabbit, a heavy load for such a small bird.|$|E
5|$|P. moranensis {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{commonly}} cultivated Pinguicula, in part due to its large size, large and pretty flowers, and the ease with which it can be grown as a container plant. Most growers use an open soil mix composed of some combination of washed sand, perlite, vermiculite, peat moss, gypsum and/or decomposed granite. Soil should be kept well drained, but watered regularly with distilled water in the summer and only <b>very</b> <b>rarely</b> once the plant enters its winter rosette. The species grows readily on well-lit windowsills, under fluorescent lights, or in warm to hot greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|Reductions in {{the size}} of host populations may cause a {{long-lasting}} reduction of louse taxonomic richness, for example, birds introduced into New Zealand host fewer species of lice there than in Europe. Louse sex ratios are more balanced in more social hosts and more female-biased in less social hosts, presumably due to the stronger isolation among louse subpopulations (living on separate birds) in the latter case. The extinction of a species results in the extinction of its host-specific lice. Host-switching is a random event that would seem <b>very</b> <b>rarely</b> likely to be successful, but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time-scales so it must be successfully accomplished sometimes.|$|E
