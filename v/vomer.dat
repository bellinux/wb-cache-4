5|$|The {{skull of}} the bowfin {{is made of}} two layers of skull, the dermatocranium and the chondrocranium. The chondrocranium layer cannot be seen because it is located below the dermal bones. The bowfin skull {{is made up of}} 28 fused bones, which compose the dermatocranium. The roof of the mouth is made up of 3 bones, the ectopterygoid, the palantine, and the <b>vomer.</b> The teeth are on two bones, the premaxillae and the maxillae. Another three bones make up the lower jaw the dentary, the angular, and the surangular. The cranial surface of the skull is made up of the nasals, the antorbital, the lacrimal, the parietal, the intertemporal, the post parietal, the supratemporal, the extra scapular, the post temporal, and the opercular. The {{entirety}} of the skull is attached to the girdle through another set of bones.|$|E
5|$|Strickland and Melville {{established}} that the dodo was anatomically similar to pigeons in many features. They pointed to the very short keratinous portion of the beak, with its long, slender, naked basal part. Other pigeons also have bare skin around their eyes, almost reaching their beak, as in dodos. The forehead was high {{in relation to the}} beak, and the nostril was located low on the middle of the beak and surrounded by skin, a combination of features shared only with pigeons. The legs of the dodo were generally more similar to those of terrestrial pigeons than of other birds, both in their scales and in their skeletal features. Depictions of the large crop hinted at a relationship with pigeons, in which this feature is more developed than in other birds. Pigeons generally have very small clutches, and the dodo is said to have laid a single egg. Like pigeons, the dodo lacked the <b>vomer</b> and septum of the nostrils, and it shared details in the mandible, the zygomatic bone, the palate, and the hallux. The dodo differed from other pigeons mainly in the small size of the wings and the large size of the beak in proportion {{to the rest of the}} cranium.|$|E
25|$|The {{species was}} first scientifically {{described}} by the American ichthyologist Theodore Gill, who named the species Carangoides dorsalis based on the holotype taken from {{the west coast of}} Central America. This name and description was published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, in which Gill one year previously described another carangid, <b>Vomer</b> dorsalis. The state of carangid taxonomy at the time was rather confusing, with many synonymous genera and species present in the literature, and <b>Vomer</b> dorsalis was soon moved to Caranx, as was Carangoides dorsalis, creating a taxonomic homonym. To address this problem, the American ichthyologists David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert in 1883 created the name Caranx otrynter as a replacement for the species originally named Carangoides dorsalis, basing their description on a new holotype specimen taken from Mazatlán, Mexico.|$|E

50|$|In bony fish, the <b>vomers</b> are flattened, paired, bones {{forming the}} {{anterior}} {{part of the}} roof of the mouth, just behind the premaxillary bones. In many species, they have teeth, supplementing those in the jaw proper; in some extinct species the teeth on the <b>vomers</b> were actually larger than the primary set. In amphibians and reptiles, the <b>vomers</b> become narrower, due to the presence of the enlarged choanae (the inner part of the nostrils) on either side, and they may extend further back in the jaw. They are typically small in birds, where they form the upper hind part of the beak, again being located between the choanae.|$|R

25|$|Eogavialis {{has often}} been {{proposed}} to be non-tomistomine due to its lack of supposedly crocodylid synapomorphies needed {{in order for a}} taxon to be placed within Tomistominae. The genus lacks the exposure of the <b>vomer</b> on the palate that has been viewed as a characteristic of tomistomines. The trend for a long, narrow rostrum developing progressively over time as seen in Eogavialis has been used to suggest that the genus was a direct ancestor of Gavialis. Gryposuchus was once seen as phylogenetically between Eogavialis and Gavialis.|$|E
25|$|In {{the upper}} {{portion of the}} nose, the paired nasal bones attach to the frontal bone. Above and to the side (superolaterally), the paired nasal bones connect to the {{lacrimal}} bones, and below and to the side (inferolaterally), they attach to the ascending processes of the maxilla (upper jaw). Above and to the back (posterosuperiorly), the bony nasal septum is composed of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone. The <b>vomer</b> bone lies below and to the back (posteroinferiorly), and partially forms the choanal opening into the nasopharynx, (the upper portion of the pharynx that is continuous with the nasal passages). The floor of the nose comprises the premaxilla bone and the palatine bone, {{the roof of the}} mouth.|$|E
25|$|The {{nasal septum}} is {{composed}} of the quadrangular cartilage, the <b>vomer</b> bone (the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone), aspects of the premaxilla, and the palatine bones. Each lateral nasal wall contains three pairs of turbinates (nasal conchae), which are small, thin, shell-form bones: (i) the superior concha, (ii) the middle concha, and (iii) the inferior concha, which are the bony framework of the turbinates. Lateral to the turbinates is the medial wall of the maxillary sinus. Inferior to the nasal conchae (turbinates) is the meatus space, with names that correspond to the turbinates, e.g. superior turbinate, superior meatus, et alii. The internal roof of the nose is composed by the horizontal, perforated cribriform plate (of the ethmoid bone) through which pass sensory filaments of the olfactory nerve (Cranial nerve I); finally, below and behind (posteroinferior) the cribriform plate, sloping down at an angle, is the bony face of the sphenoid sinus.|$|E
50|$|Looking at the palate, {{it has a}} pronounced, sagittally {{elongated}} vault that {{is formed}} primarily by the <b>vomers.</b> The <b>vomers</b> contact the premaxillae at a level with the maxillary tooth margin towards {{the tip of the}} rostrum. However, it does curve strongly dorsally towards the palatines, and so we see the choanae very far above the tooth margin. To withdraw the choana further from the oral cavity, the vomerine and palatine borders of the choana are recessed dorsally.|$|R
50|$|At the {{underside}} of the skull, the paired front praemaxillae form a bony secondary palate, with a concave surface. Each praemaxilla is pierced by two foramina. Both elements are at the snout tip separated by a gap, ending about thirty-five millimetres in front of the tip of the narrow and flat <b>vomers</b> at the midline. Behind the praemaxillae, the internal wings of the maxillae form the edges of the choanae, the internal nostrils. To the rear of the <b>vomers,</b> triangular palatine bones are located. These are not pierced by large fenestrae though a triangular depression is present at their undersides.|$|R
50|$|Edenopteron is {{assigned}} to the Gondwanan tristichopterid subfamily Mandageriinae due to similarities shared with Cabonnichthys and Mandageria, including paired <b>vomers</b> in the palate, submandibular bones overlapping ventral jaw margin, and scales ornamented with widely-spaced grooves.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Freer, in 1902, and Killian, in 1904, {{respectively}} pioneered the Submucous Resection septoplasty (SMR) procedure for correcting a deviated septum; they raised mucoperichondrial tissue flaps, and resected the cartilaginous and bony septum (including the <b>vomer</b> bone and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone), maintaining septal support with a 1.0-cm margin at the dorsum and a 1.0-cm margin at the caudad, for which innovations the technique became the foundational, standard septoplastic procedure. In 1921, A. Rethi introduced the open rhinoplasty approach featuring an incision to the columella to facilitate modifying {{the tip of}} the nose. In 1929, Peer and Metzenbaum performed the first manipulation of the caudal septum, where it originates and projects from the forehead. In 1947, Maurice H. Cottle (1898–1981) endonasally resolved a septal deviation with a minimalist hemitransfixion incision, which conserved the septum; thus, he advocated for the practical primacy of the closed rhinoplasty approach. In 1957, A. Sercer advocated the “decortication of the nose” (Dekortication des Nase) technique which featured a columellar-incision open rhinoplasty that allowed greater access to the nasal cavity and to the nasal septum.|$|E

2500|$|The base of {{the upper}} mandible, or the roof when seen from the mouth, is the palate, the {{structure}} of which differs greatly in the ratites. Here, the <b>vomer</b> is large and connects with premaxillae and maxillopalatine bones in a condition termed as a [...] "paleognathous palate". All other extant birds have a narrow forked <b>vomer</b> that does not connect with other bones and is then termed as neognathous. The shape of these bones varies across the bird families.|$|E
50|$|Chenoprosopus {{belongs to}} clade Edopoidea, a {{superfamily}} of temnospondyl. Edopoidea has several primitive characteristics of temnospondyls. These are namely {{the retention of}} intertemporal ossification, and the palatine rami of the pterygoids meeting anteriorly to exclude the palatines and <b>vomers</b> from the interpterygoid vacuity margins.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, {{while the}} <b>vomers</b> of later dicynodonts are fused, they are paired in Eodicynodon and {{together}} with the pterygoid border the intervomero-pterygoidal vacuity; in more derived dicynodonts, this vacuity is more posteriorly located and exclusively bordered by the pterygoid. These features are also present in more primitive relatives of dicynodonts, including Pristerodon, sphenacodont pelycosaurs, cotylosaurs, and Venyukovia.|$|R
5000|$|Niaftasuchus is an extinct genus of synapsid. Only {{one species}} is recorded, Niaftasuchus zekkeli, from Nyafta, basin of the Mezen' River, Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia. The family Niaftasuchidae {{was created by}} Ivankhenko in 1990, and {{initially}} attributed to the Tapinocephalia, essentially {{on the basis of}} the dentition; later it was regarded as Biarmosuchia, by share big orbits and fused <b>vomers.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Asian arowanas {{grow up to}} [...] total length. Like all Scleropages, Asian arowanas {{have long}} bodies; large, {{elongated}} pectoral fins, dorsal and anal fins located far back on the body; and a much larger caudal fin than that of their South American relative, the silver arowana, Osteoglossum bicirrhosum. The mouth is oblique with a very wide gape. The prominent lower jaw has two barbels at its tip. The gill rakers are stout. Asian arowanas bear teeth on many bones of the mouth, including the jaws, <b>vomer,</b> palatines, pterygoids, parasphenoid, and tongue.|$|E
2500|$|The {{threadfin}} jack or thread pompano, Carangoides otrynter, is {{a species}} of coastal marine fish in the jack family Carangidae. The species inhabits the tropical waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean from Baja California in the north to Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands in the south. It is a moderately large fish, growing to [...] and may be recognized by its filamentous dorsal and anal fin lobes. The threadfin jack inhabits both deeper coastal waters and inshore environments, including reefs and estuaries, where it preys on minute benthic and pelagic organisms, including small fishes and crustaceans. Very {{little is known about}} the ecology and reproductive cycle in the species. The threadfin jack is of importance to fisheries throughout its distribution, caught by hook-and-line and net methods and marketed fresh and salted, and is considered a very good table fish. The species was named Carangoides dorsalis by Theodore Gill 20 years before the name Caranx otrynter was introduced, but confusion with <b>Vomer</b> dorsalis led to the proposal of the new name to separate the two species.|$|E
2500|$|The golden {{trevally}} {{is a relatively}} large fish, growing to a maximum recorded size of 120cm in length and 15.0 kg in weight. It is similar to most other trevallies and jacks in having a compressed, oblong body, with the dorsal profile slightly more [...] than the ventral profile, particularly anteriorly. The species' mouth {{is one of its}} defining features; the mouth is highly protractile and fleshy, with specimens greater than 90mm having no teeth on the jaws, <b>vomer</b> or tongue. Smaller individuals have a series of small villiform teeth in both jaws. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first with 7 spines, the second with 1 spine and 18 to 20 soft rays. The anal fin has 2 detached spines followed by 1 spine and 15 to 17 soft rays, while the pelvic fin consists of 1 spine and 19 to 20 soft rays. The curved part of the lateral line is moderately arched; containing 62 to 73 scales, and approximately equal in length to the straight section containing 15 to 27 scales and 18 to 25 scutes. The breast is completely scaled. There are 27 to 30 gill rakers and 24 vertebrae in total.|$|E

50|$|Although the skulls {{of fossil}} lobe-finned fish {{resemble}} those of the early tetrapods, the same cannot be said of those of the living lungfishes. The skull roof is not fully formed, and consists of multiple, somewhat irregularly shaped bones with no direct relationship to those of tetrapods. The upper jaw is formed from the pterygoids and <b>vomers</b> alone, all of which bear teeth. Much of the skull is formed from cartilage, and its overall structure is reduced.|$|R

60|$|Section 3. The {{skin of the}} dog-fish {{is closely}} set with pointed tooth-like scales, the placoid scales, and these are {{continued}} over the lips into the mouth as teeth. Each scale consists of a base of true bone, with a little tubercle of a harder substance, dentine, capped by a still denser covering, the enamel. The enamel {{is derived from the}} outer layer of the embryonic dog-fish, the epiblast, which also gives rise to the epidermis; while the dentine and bony base arise in the underlying mesoblast, the dermis. A mammalian tooth has essentially the same structure: an outer coat of enamel, derived from epiblast, overlies a mass of dentine, resting on bone, but the dentine is excavated internally, to form a pulpcavity containing blood-vessels and nerves. Most land animals, however, have teeth only in their mouths, and have lost altogether the external teeth which constitute the armour of the dog-fish. Besides the teeth there perhaps remain relics of the placoid scales in the anatomy of the higher vertebrata, in the membrane bones. How placoid scales may have given rise to these structures will be understood by considering such a bone as the <b>vomer</b> of the frog. This bone lies {{on the roof of the}} frog's mouth, and bears a number of denticles, and altogether there is a very strong resemblance in it to a number of placoid scales the bony bases of which have become confluent. In the salamander, behind the teeth-bearing vomers comes a similar toothed parasphenoid bone. The same bone occurs in a corresponding position in the frog, but without teeth. In some tailed amphibians the vomers and splenials are known to arise by the fusion of small denticles. These facts seem to point to stages in the fusion of placoid bases, and their withdrawal from the surface to become incorporated with the cranial apparatus as membrane bones, a process entirely completed in the mammalian type.|$|E
50|$|Few {{advantages}} of the <b>vomer</b> flap procedure include the relative simple execution compared to other palatoplasties, amount of surgery time, and similarity between the <b>vomer</b> tissue and the nasal mucosa. A major disadvantage of the <b>vomer</b> flap surgery is the varying size and visibility of the <b>vomer</b> in different patients. If the <b>vomer</b> is not visible or too small to cover the cleft, the procedure cannot be done. Another disadvantage {{of the use of}} the <b>vomer</b> flap in the oral cavity is that the <b>vomer</b> tissue does not aesthetically match the oral mucosa. The color and texture of the <b>vomer</b> mucosa matches the nasal mucosa much better than the oral mucosa. Sometimes, patients are displeased and uncomfortable with the visible <b>vomer</b> flap in the oral cavity.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vomer</b> is a {{triangle}} shaped bone {{that forms the}} inferior and posterior portion of the nasal septum (www.emedicine.com/plastic/topic519.htm). A <b>vomer</b> flap {{is a type of}} palatoplasty surgery that uses the mucoperiosteal tissue of the <b>vomer</b> to cover a unilateral or bilateral cleft palate. This procedure can be used to reconstruct the nasal or oral surfaces by either raising the <b>vomer</b> or creating a flap. Surgical procedures can be combined according to type of clefting in order to ensure the best outcomes for the patient. <b>Vomer</b> flap surgery involves the suture line of the <b>vomer</b> bone which is an important site for midface growth. In this case, a suture line refers to boundary between two bony plates which eventually grow together as the child matures.|$|E
5000|$|The upper jaw had a {{marginal}} row of small teeth on the maxilla and premaxilla, medium-sized fangs on the ectopterygoid and dermopalatine bones, and large tusks on the <b>vomers</b> and premaxillae. On the lower jaw were marginal teeth on the dentary, with fangs {{on the three}} coronoids and a huge tusk at the symphysial tip of the dentary. Apparently, {{the left and right}} mandibles rotated inwards towards each other on biting. This may have been a kinetic mechanism to dig the marginal teeth more deeply into the prey, to help grip slippery or struggling items.|$|R
5000|$|As in the skull, {{the palate}} was also heavily ossified with a {{similarity}} to their lineage with having paired anterior palatal vacuities (APV). These APVs were {{formed by the}} premaxillae (anteriorly) and the <b>vomers</b> (posteriorly). These APVs had a posteroventrally prong-like process that separated them from one another anteriorly. Another similarity was the choana which is larger in Microposaurus but still circular-elliptical in appearance. A lasting ancestral trait was the quadrate ramus’s primitive appearance of the same length and orientation. Some differences were the parasphenoid and pterygoid sutures were elongated, and the “parasphenoid was broader posteriorly than anteriorly”.|$|R
5000|$|Daza et al. (2016) {{described}} a small (10,6 mm in snout-vent length), probably neonatal lizard {{preserved in the}} Cretaceous (Albian-Cenomanian boundary) amber from Myanmar.

The phylogenetic analysis conducted by the authors indicated that the lizard was a stem-chamaeleonid.|$|R
