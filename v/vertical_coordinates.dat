Heun’s Method considers the tangent lines to the solution curve {{at both ends of the}} interval, one which overestimates, and one which underestimates the ideal <b>vertical</b> <b>coordinates.</b> A prediction line must be constructed based on the right end point tangent’s slope alone, approximated using Euler's Method. If this slope is passed through the left end point of the interval, the result is evidently too steep to be used as an ideal prediction line and overestimates the ideal point. Therefore, the ideal point lies approximately halfway between the erroneous overestimation and underestimation, the average of the two slopes.Euler’s Method is used to roughly estimate the coordinates of the next point in the solution, and with this knowledge, the original estimate is re-predicted or corrected. Assuming that the quantity [...] on the right hand side of the equation can be thought of as the slope of the solution sought at any point , this can be combined with the Euler estimate of the next point to give the slope of the tangent line at the right end-point. Next the average of both slopes is used to find the corrected coordinates of the right end interval.|$|E

5000|$|The FIM {{is being}} {{developed}} as a candidate to eventually supplant the Global Forecast System, the United States's current medium-range forecast model. The FIM was originally slated to become operational some time in 2014 (as of autumn 2016 the model is still testing); the GFS {{will continue to be}} run and maintained for several years afterward, much in the same way the GFS and its predecessor, the Nested Grid Model, ran concurrently for several years. The model currently produces similar results to the GFS, but runs slower on the NWS's operational computers. Its three-part name derives from its key features: [...] "flow-following" [...] indicates that its <b>vertical</b> <b>coordinates</b> are based on both terrain and potential temperature (isentropic sigma coordinates, previously used in the now-discontinued rapid update cycle model), and [...] "finite-volume" [...] describes the method used for calculating horizontal transport. The [...] "icosahedral" [...] portion describes the model's most uncommon feature: whereas most grid-based forecast models have historically used rectangular grid points (a less than ideal arrangement for a planet that is a slightly oblate spheroid), the FIM instead fits Earth to a truncated icosahedron, with twelve evenly spaced pentagons (including two at the poles) anchoring a grid of hexagons.|$|E
5000|$|The model code (see POM web, http://www.ccpo.odu.edu/POMWEB/) was {{originally}} developed at Princeton University (G. Mellor and Alan Blumberg) {{in collaboration with}} Dynalysis of Princeton (H. James Herring, Richard C. Patchen). The model incorporates the Mellor-Yamada turbulence scheme developed in the early 1970s by George Mellor and Ted Yamada; this turbulence sub-model is widely used by oceanic and atmospheric models. At the time, early computer ocean models such as the Bryan-Cox model (developed in the late 1960s at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, GFDL, and later became the Modular Ocean Model, MOM)), were aimed mostly at coarse-resolution simulations of the large-scale ocean circulation, {{so there was a}} need for a numerical model that can handle high-resolution coastal ocean processes. The Blumberg-Mellor [...] model (which later became POM) thus included new features such as free surface to handle tides, sigma <b>vertical</b> <b>coordinates</b> (i.e., terrain-following) to handle complex topographies and shallow regions, a curvilinear grid to better handle coastlines, and a turbulence scheme to handle vertical mixing. At the early 1980s the model was used primarily to simulate estuaries such as the Hudson-Raritan Estuary (by Leo Oey) and the Delaware Bay (Boris Galperin), but also first attempts to use a sigma coordinate model for basin-scale problems have started with the coarse resolution model of the Gulf of Mexico (Blumberg and Mellor) and models of the Arctic Ocean (with the inclusion of ice-ocean coupling by Lakshmi Kantha and Sirpa Hakkinen).|$|E

The fact that the model is regional implies that it requires initial conditions and lateral boundary conditions. This means that each boundary (there are four) has initialized wind speeds, temperatures, pressure and moisture fields. Thus, gridded data is needed for this program. This model takes and then analyzes its data based on pressure surfaces. However, these surfaces must first be interpolated by a specific vertical coordinate {{before it can be}} analyzed. [...] This vertical coordinate, sigma, is computed and then used throughout the program. Σ is defined as:Σ = (p-pt)/p*, p* = ps-pt, Where p is pressure, ps is surface pressure, and pt is the pressure {{at the top of the}} model. When Σ is close to the ground, the program follows the actual terrain, but when Σ is higher up, the program looks at isobaric surfaces. Σ ranges from 0 to 1. [...] It has adaptable and multiple nesting capabilities, which allows multiple programs to run at once, while utilizing 2-way nesting. MM5 features inputs from actual data, which is helpful because routine observations can be used. Then, data can be compared and used in context with other models. [...] MM5 also features terrain-following <b>vertical</b> <b>coordinates</b> and four-dimensional data assimilation (FDDA) [...] FDDA is used when there is a lot of data that was taken over a longer period of time. Then this data that needed to be taken over a longer period of time gets placed into FDDA. It is also utilized for dynamical initialization and four-dimensional data sets.

50|$|The {{interference}} occurs {{for white}} light when the path lengths of the measurement beam and the reference beam are nearly matched. By scanning (changing) the measurement beam path length {{relative to the}} reference beam, a correlogram is generated at each pixel. The width of the resulting correlogram is the coherence length, which depends strongly on the spectral width of the light source. A test surface having features of different heights leads to a phase pattern that is mixed with {{the light from the}} flat reference in the CCD image sensor plane. Interference occurs at the CCD pixel if the optical path lengths of the two arms differ less than half the coherence length of the light source. Each pixel of the CCD samples a different spatial position within the image of the test surface. A typical white light correlogram (interference signal) is produced when the length of the reference or measurement arm is scanned by a positioning stage through a path length match. The interference signal of a pixel has maximum modulation when the optical path length of light impinging on the pixel is exactly the same for the reference and the object beams. Therefore, the z-value for the point on the surface imaged by this pixel corresponds to the z-value of the positioning stage when the modulation of the correlogram is greatest. A matrix with the height values of the object surface can be derived by determining the z-values of the positioning stage where the modulation is greatest for every pixel. The vertical uncertainty depends mainly on the roughness of the measured surface. For smooth surfaces, the accuracy of the measurement is limited by the accuracy of the positioning stage. The lateral positions of the height values depend on the corresponding object point that is imaged by the pixel matrix. These lateral coordinates, together with the corresponding <b>vertical</b> <b>coordinates,</b> describe the surface topography of the object.|$|E

Two different cases were simulated: (i) a downslope windstorm along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, and (ii) stably stratified flow blocked by high mountains in Taiwan. Flow separation on the lee side of the mountains, previously shown to occur in idealized two-dimensional Eta simulations, was also apparent in these real data cases, even for the downslope wind event. The step orography resulted in a substantial underestimate of wind speeds to the lee of the Rockies during the windstorm. Near the surface, both the eta and sigma simulations of the Taiwan blocking event were comparable. For both events, the use of step orography resulted in much weaker mountain waves than occurred when the sigma <b>vertical</b> <b>coordinate</b> was used.
