Several HIV-1 isolates were found to carry point mutations in the Vpu translation initiation codon but have otherwise intact vpu genes. Since removal of the Vpu initiation codon results in increased expression of the downstream env gene, {{it is possible that}} HIV-1 actually uses this mechanism as a molecular switch to regulate the relative expression of Vpu or Env in infected cells.

Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation is thought to prevent CD4-Env binding in the endoplasmic reticulum in order to facilitate proper Env assembly into virions. It is found in the membranes of infected cells, but not the virus particles themselves.|$|E

Here we investigated the properties of the CXCR 4 -tropic simian-human {{immunodeficiency virus}} DH 12 (SHIVDH 12) and the CCR 5 -tropic SHIVAD 8, each of which carries <b>vpu</b> <b>genes</b> derived from different primary HIV- 1 isolates. We found that virion release from infected rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cells was enhanced to various degrees by the Vpu present in both SHIVs. Transfer of the SHIVDH 12 Vpu transmembrane domain to the HIV- 1 NL 4 - 3 Vpu conferred antagonizing activity against macaque BST- 2. Inactivation of the SHIVDH 12 and SHIVAD 8 <b>vpu</b> <b>genes</b> impaired virus replication in 6 of 8 inoculated rhesus macaques, resulting in lower plasma viral RNA loads, slower losses of CD 4 + T cells, and delayed disease progression. The expanded host range of the SHIVDH 12 Vpu was not due to adaptation during passage in macaques but was an intrinsic property of the parental HIV- 1 DH 12 Vpu protein.

This gene is also found in the virus lineage of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) and chimpanzee immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz) and was recently described in viruses isolated from Cercopithecus nictitans, Cercopithecus mona, and Cercopithecus cephus. The SIVden vpu coding region is shorter than the HIV- 1 /SIVcpz and the SIVgsn, SIVmon, and SIVmus counterparts.

Three virus replication phenotypes were observed in monocytes: productive infection, silent infection, and no infection. Incorporation of the monocytetropic env determinant in a full-length clone incapable of infection or replication in primary monocytes (no infection) conferred the capacity for highly efficient virus replication in monocytes (productive infection). Clones with the env determinant but lacking either functional vpr or <b>vpu</b> <b>genes</b> generated lower replication levels in monocytes.

The rationale of this study was to characterize genetic variations that are present in the <b>vpu</b> <b>gene</b> from HIV- 1 infected individuals from North-India (Punjab/ Haryana) and determine their functional relevance. Methods: Functionally intact <b>vpu</b> <b>gene</b> variants were PCR amplified from genomic DNA of HIV- 1 infected individuals.

Results: Based on phylogenetic analysis and extensive polymorphisms with respect to consensus Vpu B and C, we were able to arbitrarily assign variants into two major groups (B and C). The group B variants always showed significantly higher virus release activity and exhibited moderate levels of cell death. On the other hand, group C variants displayed lower virus release activity but greater cell death potential.

40|$|AbstractThe human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) Vpu is an integral membrane protein that forms oligomeric structures in membranes. Expression of vpu using Sindbis virus (SV) as a vector leads to permeabilization of plasma membrane to hydrophilic molecules and impaired maturation of wild type SV glycoproteins in BHK cells. The 6 K protein is a membrane protein encoded in the SV genome that facilitates budding of virus particles and regulates transport of viral glycoproteins through the secretory pathway. Some of these functions were assayed with a SV mutant containing a partially deleted 6 K gene. Transfection of BHK cells with pSVΔ 6 K vector rendered defective SVΔ 6 K virus, which had lower membrane permeabilization, impaired glycoprotein processing, and deficient virion budding. Replacement of 6 K function by HIV- 1 Vpu in SVΔ 6 K was tested by cloning the <b>vpu</b> <b>gene</b> under a duplicated late promoter (pSVΔ 6 KVpu). The presence of the <b>vpu</b> <b>gene</b> in the 6 K-deleted virus enhances membrane permeability, modifies glycoprotein precursor processing, and facilitates infectious virus particle production. Restoration of infectivity of 6 K-deleted SV by Vpu was evidenced by increased PFU production and cytopathic effect on infected cells. The modification of SVΔ 6 K glycoprotein maturation by Vpu was reflected in augmented processing of B precursor and impairment of PE 2 cleavage. Taken together, our data {{support the notion that}} HIV- 1 Vpu and SV 6 K proteins share some analogous functions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo HIV- 1 {{accessory}} proteins, Vpu and Vif, {{are notoriously}} difficult to express autonomously {{in the absence}} of the viral Tat and Rev proteins. We examined whether the codon bias observed in the vpu and vif genes relative to highly expressed human genes contributes to the Rev dependence and low expression level outside the context of the viral genome. The entire <b>vpu</b> <b>gene</b> as well as the 5 ′ half of the vif gene were codon optimized and the resulting open reading frames (ORFs) (vphu and hvif, respectively) were cloned in autonomous expression vectors under the transcriptional control of the CMV promoter. Codon optimization efficiently removed the expression block observed in the native genes and allowed high levels of Rev- and Tat-independent expression of Vpu and Vif. Most of the higher protein levels detected are accounted for by enhanced steady-state levels of the mRNA encoding the optimized species. Nuclear run-on experiments show for the first time that codon optimization has no effect on the rate of transcriptional initiation or elongation of the vphu mRNA. Instead, optimization of the <b>vpu</b> <b>gene</b> was found to stabilize the vphu mRNA in the nucleus and enhance its export to the cytoplasm. This was achieved by allowing the optimized mRNA to use a new CRM 1 -independent nuclear export pathway. This work provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the process of codon optimization and introduces novel tools to study the biological functions of the Vpu and Vif proteins independently of other viral proteins...|$|E

Among these, only Vpu proteins of pandemic HIV- 1 group M strains evolved potent activity against the restriction factor tetherin, which inhibits virus release from infected cells. Thus, effective Vpu-mediated tetherin antagonism may have been a prerequisite for the global spread of HIV- 1. To determine whether this particular function enhances primary HIV- 1 replication and interferon resistance, we introduced mutations into the <b>vpu</b> <b>genes</b> of HIV- 1 group M and N strains to specifically disrupt their ability to antagonize tetherin, but not other Vpu functions, such as degradation of CD 4, down-modulation of CD 1 d and NTB-A, and suppression of NF-κB activity.

40|$|AbstractThe Vpu protein {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 {{has been shown to}} shunt the CD 4 receptor molecule to the proteasome for degradation and to enhance virus release from infected cells. The exact mechanism by which the Vpu protein enhances virus release is currently unknown but some investigators have shown that this function is associated with the transmembrane domain and potential ion channel properties. In this study, we determined if the transmembrane domain of Vpu could be functionally substituted with that of the prototypical viroporin, the M 2 protein of influenza A virus. We constructed chimeric <b>vpu</b> <b>gene</b> in which the transmembrane domain of Vpu was replaced with that of the M 2 protein of influenza. This chimeric <b>vpu</b> <b>gene</b> was substituted for the <b>vpu</b> <b>gene</b> in the genome of a pathogenic simian {{human immunodeficiency virus}}, SHIVKU- 1 bMC 33. The resulting virus, SHIVM 2, synthesized a Vpu protein that had a slightly different Mr compared to the parental SHIVKU- 1 bMC 33, reflecting the different sizes of the two Vpu proteins. The SHIVM 2 was shown to replicate with slightly reduced kinetics when compared to the parental SHIVKU- 1 bMC 33 but electron microscopy revealed that the site of maturation was similar to the parental virus SHIVKU 1 bMC 33. We show that the replication and spread of SHIVM 2 could be blocked with the antiviral drug rimantadine, which is known to target the M 2 ion channel. Our results indicate a dose dependent inhibition of SHIVM 2 with 100 μM rimantadine resulting in a > 95 % decrease in p 27 released into the culture medium. Rimantadine did not affect the replication of the parental SHIVKU- 1 bMC 33. Examination of SHIVM 2 -infected cells treated with 50 μM rimantadine revealed numerous viral particles associated with the cell plasma membrane and within intracytoplasmic vesicles, which is similar to HIV- 1 mutants lacking a functional vpu. To determine if SHIVM 2 was as pathogenic as the parental SHIVKU- 1 bMC 33 virus, two pig-tailed macaques were inoculated and followed for up to 8 months. Both pig-tailed macaques developed severe CD 4 + T cell loss within 1 month of inoculation, high viral loads, and histological lesions consistent with lymphoid depletion similar to the parental SHIVKU- 1 bMC 33.

Codon optimized <b>vpu</b> <b>genes</b> from subtype C isolates FV 5 and FV 15 (which have a six and two amino acid insert in the N-terminal domain, respectively) and a representative subtype B vpu were TA cloned into the pcDNA 6. 2 /C-emGFP expression vector.

Cotransfection and microscopy conditions were methodically optimised. At 24 hours post-transfection, the subtype C FV 5 Vpu had ER/Golgi localisation, but none at the PM.

40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies have}} shown that the transmembrane (TM) domain of the subtype B Vpu enhances virion release from cells and some {{studies have shown}} that this domain may form an {{oligomeric}} structure with properties of an ion channel. To date, no studies have been performed to assess the role of this domain in virus pathogenesis in a macaque model of disease. Using a pathogenic molecular clone of simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIVKU- 1 bMC 33), we have generated a novel virus in which the transmembrane domain of the Vpu protein was scrambled but maintained hydrophobic in nature (SHIVTM), which presumably would disrupt any ion channel TM properties of this protein. Vectors expressing the Vpu as a fusion protein with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (VpuTMEGFP) indicate that it was transported to the same intracellular compartment as the unmodified Vpu protein but did not down-regulate cell surface expression of CD 4. To assess the pathogenicity of SHIVTM, three pig-tailed macaques were inoculated with the SHIVTM and monitored for 6 – 8 months for CD 4 + T cell levels, viral loads and the stability of the sequence of the <b>vpu</b> <b>gene.</b> Our results indicated that unlike the parental SHIVKU- 1 bMC 33, inoculation of macaques with SHIVTM did not cause a severe CD 4 + T cell loss over the course of their infections. Sequence analysis of the <b>vpu</b> <b>gene</b> analyzed from sequential PBMC samples derived from macaques revealed that the scrambled TM was stable during the course of infection. At necropsy, examination of tissues revealed low viral loads and none of the pathology commonly observed in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues following inoculation with the pathogenic parental SHIVKU- 1 bMC 33 virus. Thus, these results show for the first time that the TM domain of Vpu contributes to the pathogenicity of SHIVKU- 1 bMC 33 in pig-tailed macaques...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{diversity}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) type 1 (HIV- 1) has been characterized mainly by analysis of the env and gag genes. Information on the vpu genes in the HIV sequence database is very limited. In the present study, the nucleotide sequences of the vpu genes were analyzed, and the genetic subtypes determined by analysis of the <b>vpu</b> <b>gene</b> were compared with those previously determined by analysis of the gag and env genes. The vpu genes were amplified by nested PCR of proviral DNA extracted from 363 HIV- 1 -infected individuals and were sequenced directly by use of the PCR products. HIV- 1 subtypes were determined by sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis with reference strains. The strains in all except one of the samples analyzed {{could be classified as}} subtype A, B, C, E, or G. The vpu subtype of one strain could not be determined. Of the strains analyzed, genetic subtypes of 247 (68. 0 %) were also determined by analysis of the env or gag gene. The genetic subtypes determined by <b>vpu</b> <b>gene</b> analysis were, in general, consistent with those determined by gag and/or env gene analysis except for those for two AG recombinant strains. All the strains that clustered with a Thailand subtype E strain in the vpu phylogenetic analyses were subtype E by env gene analysis and subtype A by gag gene analysis. In summary, our genetic typing revealed that subtype B strains, which constituted 73. 8 % of all strains analyzed, were most prevalent in Taiwan. While subtype E strains constituted about one-quarter of the viruses, they were prevalent at a higher proportion in the group infected by heterosexual transmission. Genetic analysis of vpu may provide an alternate method for determination of HIV- 1 subtypes for most of the strains, excluding those in which intersubtype recombination has occurred...|$|E
40|$|The {{relevance}} of the accessory vpr, <b>vpu,</b> and nef <b>genes</b> for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) replication in human lymphoid tissue (HLT), the major site of viral replication in vivo, is largely unknown. Here, we show that an individual deletion of nef, vpr, or vpu significantly decreases HIV- 1 replication and prevents CD 4 + T-cell depletion in ex vivo HLT. However, only combined defects in all three accessory genes entirely disrupt the replicative capacity of HIV- 1. Our results demonstrate that nef, vpr, and vpu are all essential for efficient viral spread in HLT, suggesting {{an important role in}} AIDS pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Retroviruses {{have evolved}} {{effective}} strategies {{to evade the}} host immune response, such as high variability and latent infection. In addition, primate lentiviruses, such as HIV- 1, have acquired several “accessory” genes that antagonize antiviral host restriction factors and facilitate viral immune evasion, thereby allowing continuous and efficient viral replication despite apparently strong innate and acquired immune responses. Here, I summarize some of our current knowledge on the acquisition and function of the viral vif, vpr, <b>vpu,</b> and nef <b>genes,</b> with a particular focus on the evolution and specific properties of pandemic HIV- 1 strains that may contribute to their efficient spread and high virulence...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Vpu</b> {{accessory}} <b>gene</b> {{that originated}} in the primate lentiviral lineage leading to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is an antagonist of human tetherin/BST- 2 restriction. Most other primate lentivirus lineages, including the lineage represented by simian immunodeficiency virus SIVagm from African green monkeys (AGMs), do not encode Vpu. While some primate lineages encode gene products other than Vpu that overcome tetherin/BST- 2, we find that SIVagm does not antagonize physiologically relevant levels of AGM tetherin/BST- 2. AGM tetherin/BST- 2 can be induced by low levels of type I interferon and can potently restrict two independent strains of SIVagm. Although SIVagm Nef had an effect at low levels of AGM tetherin/BST- 2, simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmus Vpu, from a virus that infects the related monkey Cercopithecus cephus, is able to antagonize even at high levels of AGM tetherin/BST- 2 restriction. We propose that since the replication of SIVagm does not induce interferon production in vivo, tetherin/BST- 2 is not induced, and therefore, SIVagm does not need Vpu. This suggests that primate lentiviruses evolve tetherin antagonists such as Vpu or Nef only if they encounter tetherin during the typical course of natural infection...|$|R
40|$|A mutant {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 which carries a frameshift insertion in the integrase/endonuclease region of pol gene was constructed in vitro. Upon transfection into cells, although this mutant exhibited a normal phenotype with respect to expression of gag, pol, and env genes and to generation of progeny virions, no replication-competent virus in CD 4 -positive cells emerged. An assay for the single-step replication of a defective viral genome dependent on trans complementation by rev protein was established and used to monitor the early phase of viral infection process. Viral clones with a mutation in the vif, vpr, or <b>vpu</b> <b>gene</b> displayed no abnormality in the early phase. In contrast, the integrase mutant did not direct a marker gene expression after infection. Together with an observation that the mutant lacked the ability to integrate, these {{results indicated that the}} integration was required for efficient viral gene expression and productive infection of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular {{immunization}} with RevM 10, a transdominant negative {{form of the}} Rev protein, efficiently inhibits {{human immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) replication in vitro and gene therapy protocols that use this modality are currently being evaluated in human clinical trials. Development of resistance {{to this kind of}} therapy has not been previously reported. Here we show that RevM 10 -resistant HIV type 1 (HIV- 1) variants can be selected by in vitro passage of HIV- 1 in a T-lymphoblastoid cell line constitutively expressing RevM 10. Unexpectedly, the selected variants showed changes in the Rev response element (RRE) but no changes in Rev. Replacement of the wild-type RRE with a mutated RRE resulted in a virus that showed increased resistance to RevM 10. After repeated passages of the resistant variant in cells expressing RevM 10, a virus with an additional mutation in the viral <b>vpu</b> <b>gene</b> was selected. Surprisingly, a virus containing only this vpu mutation also showed some resistance to inhibition by RevM 10...|$|E
40|$|Tetherin/BST- 2 is an {{important}} host restriction factor that limits the replication of HIV and other enveloped viruses. Tetherin is a type II membrane glycoprotein with a very unusual domain structure that allows it to engage budding virions and retain them on the plasma membrane of infected cells. Following the initial report identifying tetherin as the host cell factor targeted by the HIV- 1 <b>Vpu</b> <b>gene,</b> knowledge of the molecular, structural, and cellular biology of tetherin has rapidly advanced. This paper summarizes the discovery and impact of tetherin biology on the HIV field, {{with a focus on}} recent advances in understanding its structure and function. The relevance of tetherin to replication and spread of other retroviruses is also reviewed. Tetherin is a unique host restriction factor that is likely to continue to provide new insights into host-virus interactions and illustrates well the varied ways by which host organisms defend against viral pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Two macaque monkeys were inoculated with a {{chimeric}} {{human and}} simian immunodeficiency virus carrying the tat, rev, <b>vpu</b> and env <b>genes</b> of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1. Infectious virus was recovered {{from one of the}} monkeys at 2 and 6 weeks post-infection. The hybrid nature of the isolated viruses was verified by Southern and Western blotting analyses. Both of the monkeys infected with the chimera elicited a humoral antibody response against the virus. The host range of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), the major causative virus of human AIDS, is narrow and other animal species usceptible to HIV- 1 infection are few. However, anumber of systems for the study of animal models of HIV-I infection have been reported.

40|$|AbstractInterferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) {{proteins}} {{inhibit the}} infection {{of a wide}} range of viruses including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1). At present, little is known about how viruses overcome IFITM restriction. In this study, we have utilized HIV- 1 as a model and selected IFITM 1 -resistant viruses after multiple passages of HIV- 1 in IFITM 1 -expressing SupT 1 cells. Sequencing the entire viral genome revealed several mutations in the <b>vpu</b> and envelope <b>genes,</b> among which mutations Vpu 34 and EnvG 367 E together enable efficient HIV- 1 replication in IFITM 1 -expressing cells. Vpu 34 introduces a stop codon at amino acid position 35 of Vpu, whereas EnvG 367 E changes the G 367 residue at the CD 4 -binding site of gp 120. These two mutations do not appear to overcome the downregulation of viral p 24 expression caused by IFITM 1, but rather enhance HIV- 1 replication by promoting cell-to-cell virus transmission. Altogether, our data demonstrate that HIV- 1 can mutate to evade IFITM 1 restriction by increasing cell-to-cell transmission...|$|R
40|$|HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 {{are members}} of the {{lentivirus}} subfamily. These retroviruses are approximately 50 % related at the nucleotide level (1, 2). A major difference in their genetic organization is that <b>vpu,</b> an accessory <b>gene,</b> is unique to HIV- 1 (3), while the vpx gene is found only in HIV- 2 (4, 5). Of the two viruses, HIV- 1 is the more widely distributed, accounting for approximately 95 % of all HIV infections worldwide. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences from globally circulating strains of HIV reveal a great deal of genetic diversity. Sequence analyses have shown not only that there is genom-ic heterogeneity between the various strains worldwide, but also that the diversity is unevenly dis-tributed throughout the HIV- 1 genome (2). Furthermore, intrapatient isolates have less diversity than interpatient isolates, but even within a single individual replicating viruses can differ as much as 10 % at the nucleotide level (1, 2, 6). Given this extensive variability, the development of a classifi-cation scheme for all circulating HIV- 1 strains became necessary...|$|R
