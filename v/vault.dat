5|$|Six {{versions}} of the 8-foot high <b>vault</b> were built, each with specific uses. One of the vaults was a façade built onto {{the front of a}} semitruck and was used for filming close shots of the <b>vault</b> destroying street cars. Another <b>vault</b> was a reinforced, four-wheel self-drive vehicle that was connected to 30-foot cables and dragged through the streets of San Juan by the two stunt Dodge Chargers. The four-ton <b>vault</b> was driven by stunt driver Henry Kingi, who had to wear a temperature controlled suit to compensate for the temperatures within that could exceed 100 degrees. A scene where the <b>vault</b> tumbled as the cars rounded a corner was a practical effect, and the result was more violent than the filmmakers had anticipated. Over 200 vehicles were destroyed by the <b>vault</b> during filming. Several stunts had to be cut including a final scene that would have seen the <b>vault</b> hanging {{over the edge of the}} Teodoro Moscoso Bridge. This stunt was abandoned when it was determined that even the powerful Chargers would not be able to support the vault's weight.|$|E

5|$|In Fallout Shelter, players {{build and}} {{manage their own}} <b>Vault</b> as an Overseer – the leader and {{coordinator}} of their <b>Vault.</b> Players guide and direct {{the citizens of the}} <b>Vault,</b> and need to keep them happy through meeting their needs such as power, food, and water. They rescue dwellers from the wasteland and assign them to different resource-generating buildings in the <b>Vault,</b> using the SPECIAL statistics system from the other Fallout games. Each character's SPECIAL profile affects their ability to generate different resources, and their statistics can be increased by training them in rooms devoted to each stat. The dwellers can level up over time, increasing their health, and can be given new items and weapons to help with various tasks. The number of dwellers can be increased by waiting for new dwellers from the wasteland to arrive or by pairing a male and a female dweller in living quarters to produce babies.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, the {{traditional}} <b>vaulting</b> horse {{was replaced with}} a new apparatus, sometimes known as a tongue, horse or <b>vaulting</b> table. The new apparatus is more stable, wider, and longer than the older <b>vaulting</b> horse, approximately 1 m in length and 1 m in width, giving gymnasts a larger blocking surface. This apparatus is thus considered safer than the <b>vaulting</b> horse used in the past. With the addition of this new, safer <b>vaulting</b> table, gymnasts are attempting more difficult and dangerous <b>vaults.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{complexity}} of the <b>vault</b> is another significant feature of English cathedrals. The vaults range from the simple quadripartite <b>vault</b> in the French manner at Chichester through increasingly elaborate forms including the multi-ribbed (“tierceron”) <b>vault</b> at Exeter, the similar <b>vault</b> with inter-connecting (“lierne”) ribs at Norwich, the still more elaborate variation at Winchester, the array of unique lierne vaults at Bristol, the net-like stellar vaulting of the choirs at Gloucester and York, the fan vaulting of the retro-choir at Peterborough, and the pendant vaulting of the choir at Oxford, where elaborate long stone bosses are suspended from the ceiling like lanterns. Many of the more elaborate forms are unique to England, with stellar vaulting also occurring in Spain and Germany.|$|E
