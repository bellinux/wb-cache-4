In addition, the server will leave {{for a vacation}} each time when he finds an empty system. We cast the queueing process as a Lévy process modified to have random jumps at two classes of stopping times. By using the Kella-Whitt martingale method, we obtain the limiting distribution of the <b>virtual</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>process.</b> Moreover, we investigate the busy period, the correlation structure and the stochastic decomposition properties. These results may be generalized to Lévy processes with multi-class jump inputs or Lévy-driven queues with multiple input classes...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a single-server queue fed by K independent renewal arrival streams, each rep-resenting a different job class. Jobs are processed in a FIFO fashion, regardless of class. The {{total amount of}} work arriving to the system exceeds the server’s capacity. That is, the nominal traffic intensity {{of the system is}} assumed to be greater than one. Jobs arriving to the system grow impatient and abandon the queue after a random amount of time if service has not yet begun. Interarrival, service and abandonment times are assumed to be generally distributed and class specific. We approximate this system using both fluid and diffusion limits. To this end, {{we consider}} a sequence of systems indexed by n in which the arrival and service rates are proportional to n; the abandonment distribution remains fixed across the sequence. In our first main result, we show that in the limit as n tends to infinity, the <b>virtual</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>process</b> for those jobs that do not abandon from the queue converges to a limiting deterministic process. This limit may be characterized as the solution to a first order ODE. Specific examples are then presented for which the ODE may be explicitly solved. In our second main result, we refine the deterministic fluid approximation by showing that the fluid centered and diffusion scaled <b>virtual</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>process</b> weakly converges to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process whose drift and infinitesimal variance both vary over time. This process may also be solved for explicitly, thus yielding approximations to the transient as well as steady state behavior of the queue...|$|E
40|$|Motivated by {{call center}} practice, we propose a {{tractable}} model for GI/GI/n+GI queues in the efficiency-driven (ED) regime. We use a one-dimensional diffusion process to approximate the <b>virtual</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>process</b> that is scaled in both space and time, {{with the number}} of servers and the mean patience time as the respective scaling factors. Using this diffusion model, we obtain the steady-state distributions of virtual waiting time and queue length, which in turn yield simple formulas for performance measures such as the service level and the effective abandonment fraction. These formulas are generally accurate when the mean patience time is several times longer than the mean service time and the patience time distribution does not change rapidly around the mean virtual waiting time. For practical purposes, these formulas outperform existing results that rely on the exponential service time assumption. To justify the diffusion model, we formulate an asymptotic framework by considering a sequence of queues, in which both the number of servers and the mean patience time go to infinity. We prove that the space-time scaled <b>virtual</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>process</b> converges in distribution to the one-dimensional diffusion process. A fundamental result for proving the diffusion limit is a functional central limit theorem (FCLT) for the superposition of renewal processes. We prove that the superposition of many independent, identically distributed stationary renewal processes, after being centered and scaled in space and time, converges in distribution to a Brownian motion. As a useful technical tool, this theorem characterizes the service completion process in heavy traffic, allowing us to greatly simplify the many-server analysis when service times follow a general distribution.

40|$|This work {{considers}} a many-server queueing {{system in which}} impatient customers with i. i. d., generally distributed service times and i. i. d., generally distributed patience times enter service {{in the order of}} arrival and abandon the queue if the time before possible entry into service exceeds the patience time. The dynamics of the system is represented in terms of a pair of measure-valued processes, one that keeps track of the waiting times of the customers in queue and the other that keeps track of the amounts of time each customer being served has been in service. Under mild assumptions, essentially only requiring that the service and reneging distributions have densities, as both the arrival rate and the number of servers go to infinity, a law of large numbers (or fluid) limit is established for this pair of processes. The limit is shown to be the unique solution of a coupled pair of deterministic integral equations that admits an explicit representation. In addition, a fluid limit for the <b>virtual</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>process</b> is also established. This paper extends previous work by Kaspi and Ramanan, which analyzed the model in the absence of reneging. A strong motivation for understanding performance in the presence of reneging arises from models of call centers.

40|$|We study {{systems with}} {{two classes of}} {{impatient}} customers who differ across the classes in their distribution of service times and patience times. The customers are served on a first-come, first served basis (FCFS) regardless of their class. Such systems are common in customer call centers, which often segment their arrivals into classes of callers whose requests differ in their complexity and criticality. We first consider an $M$/$G$/ 1 + $M$ queue and then analyze the $M$/$M$/$k$ + $M$ case. Analyzing these systems using a queue length process proves intractable as it would require us {{to keep track of}} the class of each customer at each position in queue. Consequently, we introduce a <b>virtual</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> <b>process</b> where the service times of customers who will eventually abandon the system are not considered. We analyze this process to obtain performance measures such as the percentage of customers receiving service in each class, the expected waiting times of customers in each class, and the average number of customers waiting in queue. We use our characterization to perform a numerical analysis of the $M$/$M$/$k$ + $M$ system, and find several managerial implications of administering a FCFS system with multiple classes of impatient customers. Finally, we compare the performance a system based on data from a call center with the steady-state performance measures of a comparable $M$/$M$/$k$ + $M$ system. We find that the performance measures of the $M$/$M$/$k$ + $M$ system serve as good approximations of the system based on real data...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the time-dependent moments of the workload process in the M/G/ 1 queue. The k th moment {{as a function of}} time can be characterized in terms of a differential equation involving lower moment functions and the time-dependent server-occupation probability. For general initial conditions, we show that the first two moment functions can be represented as the difference of two nondecreasing functions, one of which is the moment function starting at zero. The two nondecreasing components can be regarded as probability cumulative distribution functions (cdf's) after appropriate normalization. The normalized moment functions starting empty are called moment cdf's; the other normalized components are called moment-difference cdf's. We establish relations among these cdf's using stationary-excess relations. We apply these relations to calculate moments and derivatives at the origin of these cdf's. We also obtain results for the covariance function of the stationary workload process. It is interesting that these various time-dependent characteristics can be described directly in terms of the steady-state workload distribution.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{establish}} a joint {{central limit theorem}} for customer and time averages by applying a martingale central limit theorem in a Markov framework. The limiting values of the two averages appear in the translation terms. This central limit theorem helps to construct confidence intervals for estimators and perform statistical tests. It thus helps determine which finite average is a more asymptotically efficient estimator of its limit. As a basis for testing for PASTA (Poisson arrivals see time averages), we determine the variance constant associated with the central limit theorem for {{the difference between the}} two averages when PASTA holds.

When the two limiting averages need not agree, we want to estimate their difference and be able to test for ASTA. To illustrate what happens when ASTA is known to hold, we give two examples.
