In 1952, Dingane's Day was changed to Day of the Covenant and in 1980 was changed to The Day of the <b>Vow.</b> The Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria was erected on 16 December 1949 to commemorate Dingane's Day.|$|E

5000|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, the <b>vows</b> {{of members}} of {{religious}} orders and congregations are regulated by canons 654-658 of the Code of Canon Law. These are public <b>vows,</b> meaning <b>vows</b> accepted by a superior {{in the name of}} the Church, and are usually of two durations: temporary, and, after a few years, final <b>vows</b> (permanent or [...] "perpetual"). Depending on the order, temporary <b>vows</b> may be renewed a number of times before permission to take final <b>vows</b> is given. There are exceptions: the Jesuits' first <b>vows</b> are perpetual, for instance, and the Sisters of Charity take only temporary but renewable <b>vows.</b>|$|R
50|$|Religious <b>vows</b> are of two varieties: simple <b>vows</b> and solemn <b>vows.</b> The {{highest level}} of {{commitment}} is exemplified {{by those who have}} taken their solemn, perpetual <b>vows.</b> There once were significant technical differences between them in canon law; but these differences were suppressed by the current Code of Canon Law in 1983, although the nominal distinction is maintained. Only a limited number of religious congregations may invite their members to solemn vows; most religious congregations are only authorized to take simple <b>vows.</b> Even in congregations with solemn <b>vows,</b> some members with perpetual <b>vows</b> may have taken them simply rather than solemnly.|$|R
5|$|These Nishidhis {{detail the}} names, dates, the {{duration}} of the <b>vow,</b> and other austerities performed by the person who observed the <b>vow.</b> The earliest Nishidhis (6th to 8th century) mostly have an inscription on the rock without any symbols. This style continued until the 10th century when footprints were added alongside the inscription. After the 11th century, Nishidhis are inscribed on slabs or pillars with panels and symbols. These slabs or pillars were frequently erected in mandapas (pillared pavilions), near basadi (temples), or sometimes as an inscription on the door frame or pillars of the temple.|$|E
5|$|A {{king who}} fights in {{defending}} his empire, however, does {{not violate the}} <b>vow</b> of ahimsa, for his motive is to protect his subjects. The same {{is the case with}} the judge who punishes to maintain law and order.|$|E
5|$|Ahimsa (Non-violence or Non-injury). Mahavira {{taught that}} every living being has {{sanctity}} and dignity {{of its own}} {{and it should be}} respected just as one expects one's own sanctity and dignity to be respected. Ahimsa is formalised into Jain doctrine as the first and foremost <b>vow.</b> The concept applies to action, speech, and thought.|$|E
5000|$|Jain ethical code prescribes two dharmas or {{rules of}} conduct. One {{for those who}} wish to become ascetic and another for the śrāvaka (householders). Five {{fundamental}} <b>vows</b> are prescribed for both votaries. These <b>vows</b> are observed by śrāvakas (householders) partially and are termed as anuvratas (small <b>vows).</b> Ascetics observe these fives <b>vows</b> more strictly and therefore observe complete abstinence. These five <b>vows</b> are:- ...|$|R
5000|$|The same Code also {{abolished}} the distinction {{according to which}} solemn <b>vows,</b> unlike simple <b>vows,</b> were indissoluble. It recognized no totally indispensable religious <b>vows</b> and thereby abrogated for the Latin Church the special consecration that distinguished [...] "orders" [...] (institutes with solemn <b>vows)</b> from [...] "congregations" [...] (institutes with simple <b>vows),</b> while keeping some juridical distinctions between the two classes.|$|R

5|$|Sallekhana is a <b>vow</b> {{available}} to both for Jain ascetics and householders.

Eventually, after he accidentally shreds George's memoirs, the former President spanks Bart. An outraged Homer confronts George and both men <b>vow</b> to make trouble for each other.|$|E
5|$|Haakon also {{attempted}} to strengthen his {{ties with the}} papacy by issuing a <b>vow</b> of crusade. In 1241 he however converted this into a <b>vow</b> of engaging in warfare against pagan peoples in the north {{in light of the}} Mongol invasion of Europe. When a group of Karelians ("Bjarmians") had been forced westwards by the Mongols, Haakon allowed them to stay in Malangen and had them Christianized—something that would please the papacy. Later, in 1248, Louis IX of France proposed (by Matthew Paris as messenger) to Haakon to join him for a crusade, with Haakon as commander of the fleet, but Haakon turned the offer down. While Haakon had been unsuccessful in gaining the recognition of Pope Gregory IX, he quickly gained the support from Pope Innocent IV who sought alliances in his struggle with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Haakon finally achieved royal recognition by Pope Innocent in 1246, and Cardinal William of Sabina was sent to Bergen and crowned Haakon in 1247.|$|E

Pam's rejection sent Roy into a downward spiral, hitting rock bottom with a drunk driving arrest. When being interviewed by the camera crew, Roy makes a <b>vow</b> to win Pam back.|$|E
5|$|Jain texts make a clear {{distinction}} between the Sallekhana and suicide. Its dualistic theology differentiates between soul and matter. Soul is reborn in the Jain belief based on accumulated karma, how one dies contributes to the karma accumulation, and a pious death reduces the negative karmic attachments. The preparation for sallekhana must begin early, much before the approach of death, and when death is imminent, the <b>vow</b> of Sallekhana is observed by progressively slenderising the body and the passions.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{historically}} contentious views within Jainism {{is in part}} attributed to Mahavira and his ascetic life where he never wore any clothes as a mark of disowning everything (interpreted {{as a consequence of}} the fifth <b>vow</b> of Aparigraha). The disputes triggered by this teaching of Mahavira are those related to gender and whether a female mendicant (sadhvi) can achieve spiritual liberation just like a male mendicant (sadhu) through Jain ascetic practices.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{after the}} victory the festival of the Agroteras Thysia ("sacrifice to the Agrotéra") {{was held at}} Agrae near Athens, in honor of Artemis Agrotera ("Artemis the Huntress"). This was in {{fulfillment}} of a <b>vow</b> made by the city before the battle, to offer in sacrifice a number of goats {{equal to that of}} the Persians slain in the conflict. The number was so great, it was decided to offer 500 goats yearly until the number was filled. Xenophon notes that at his time, 90 years after the battle, goats were still offered yearly.|$|E
5000|$|Interpreting {{the law of}} <b>vows</b> in [...] the Mishnah {{taught that}} a young child’s <b>vows</b> were not binding. When a girl turned 11 years old and {{throughout}} the year thereafter, they examined to determine whether {{she was aware of}} the significance of her <b>vows.</b> The <b>vows</b> of a girl 12 years old or older stood without examination. When a boy turned 12 years old and throughout the year thereafter, they examined to determine whether he was aware of the significance of his <b>vows.</b> The <b>vows</b> of a boy 13 years old or older stood without examination. For girls below age 11 or boys below age 12, even if they said that they knew in honor of Whose Name they <b>vowed,</b> their <b>vows</b> and dedications were not valid. After girls turned 12 or boys turned 13, even though they said {{that they did not know}} in the honor of Whose Name they <b>vowed,</b> their <b>vows</b> and dedications stood. The Sifri Zutta told that once a youth told Rabbi Akiva that the youth had dedicated a shovel. Rabbi Akiva asked the youth whether perhaps he had sanctified his shovel to the sun or the moon. The youth replied that Rabbi Akiva did not need to worry, as the youth had sanctified it to the One Who had created them. Rabbi Akiva told the youth that his <b>vows</b> were valid.|$|R
50|$|Until the 19th Century the {{religious}} communities {{were divided into}} two groups: regular orders with solemn <b>vows</b> and congregations of simple <b>vows.</b> Only those taking the solemn <b>vows</b> were valued by the Church and the civil authorities.|$|R
50|$|Buddha {{established}} both lay and ordained Pratimoksha <b>vows,</b> {{and established}} several levels of ordination <b>vows.</b> Traditionally, the {{different levels of}} ordination are distinguished by the specific number of <b>vows</b> taken, and by the ceremony {{in which they were}} received. In the NKT-IKBU, Kelsang Gyatso established a simplified tradition of ordination with ten <b>vows</b> that summarize the entire Vinaya, and a single ordination ceremony.|$|R
