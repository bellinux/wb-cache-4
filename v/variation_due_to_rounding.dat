40|$|General and {{specific}} environmental adaptation of genotypes {{is the main}} goal of breeders. However, genotype-by-environment (G × E) interaction complicates the identification of genotypes for release. This study aimed at analyzing the effects of G × E interaction on the expression of important cassava traits using two multivariate analyses: additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) and genotype stability index (GSI). Total carotene content (TCC), postharvest physiological deterioration (PPD), and reaction to viral diseases were significantly affected by G × E interaction effects. The low percent (%) <b>variation</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> genotype for cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) explained the influence of environment on CBSD expression. The % <b>variation</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> genotype for TCC was higher (96 %) than <b>variation</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> environment (1. 7 %) and G × E interaction (2. 4 %) indicating a low interaction effect of environment on TCC accumulation. The % <b>variation</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> genotype was higher than % <b>variation</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> environment for all traits but CBSD root necrosis and CBSD on stems, indicating the influence of environment on {{the severity of the}} viral diseases. These findings indicate that screening for disease resistance requires multi-environment trials, whereas a single-environment trial suffices to screen for total carotene content...|$|R
