40|$|Purpose: Postoperative voiding {{dysfunction}} is a bothersome complication after mid-urethral sling surgery. The {{current study}} presents multiple repeated postoperative voiding trials against a urine load of preoperative functional bladder capacity, as estimated by a preoperative frequency <b>volume</b> <b>chart,</b> {{to identify the}} relevance of preoperative and immediate factors to the outcome. Methods: A total of 180 patients were enrolled from August 2008 to August 2011. Patients received mid-urethral sling surgery with a transobturator tape, with or without concomitant cystocele repair. Patients reported relevant medical histories and a 3 -day frequency <b>volume</b> <b>chart</b> and underwent urodynamic studies. After surgery, patients were filled to their maximum bladder capacity as dictated by their frequency <b>volume</b> <b>chart</b> and performed the first voiding trial. Two subsequent voiding trials were performed after natural filling. Failure of any single voiding trial was considered failure. Patients who failed the final voiding trial received intermittent catheterization to follow-up. After screening for relevant factors {{with the use of}} univariate analyses, preoperative, surgical, and postoperative factors predicting outcome were estimated by logistic regression analysis. Results: The urine load at the voiding trial and the peak flow rate immediately preceding the voiding trial predicted voiding trial success in the multivariate analysis. Urine load and previous trial peak flow rate were relevant when tested against each individual voiding trial. Preoperative and surgical factors, such as age, parity, and concomitant cystocele repair, showed significance in the univariate analysis. Overall, 16. 1 % of patients who passed the first voiding trial failed on subsequent trials, whereas 36. 8 % of patients who failed the first voiding trial succeeded...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the type of}} nocturia and concomitant voiding dysfunction (VD) {{and the effect of}} desmopressin treatment on nocturia in women. Materials and Methods: We reviewed 84 women who experienced more than 2 nocturia episodes as recorded on a pretreatment frequency <b>volume</b> <b>chart</b> and who were treated with desmopressin. All patients underwent history taking, physical examination, uri-nalysis, International Prostate Symptom Score assessment, completion of a urinary sensation scale, and completion of a 3 day frequency <b>volume</b> <b>chart.</b> Nocturia was divided into nocturnal polyuria (NP), reduced nocturnal bladder capacity (RNBC), and mixed type. After treatment with desmopressin, a reduction in nocturia of over 50 % compared with baseline was regarded as effective. Results: Among 84 women, the most common concomitant VD was overactive bladder (OAB, 60. 7 %). NP was observed in 70. 2 % (59 / 84) of the women, RNBC in 7. 1 % (6 / 84), and mixed type in 22. 6 % (19 / 84).

Methods: All consecutive women who had pure OAB symptoms (including urgency with or without urgency incontinence and frequency) for at least 3 Â months were considered for this study. Women were divided into two groups: women without any previous pharmacological treatment for OAB (group 1) and women with a previous history of failed antimuscarinics therapy (group 2).

Twenty-five patients diagnosed with BPH were administered daily oral doses of naftopidil (50 or 75 mg/day) for eight weeks. The symptoms were assessed quantitatively {{using the following criteria}} : International Prostate Symptoms Score (I-PSS), QOL index, frequency <b>volume</b> <b>chart,</b> and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). After treatment, the mean±SD of total I-PSS and nocturia decreased from 16. 9 ± 5. 2 to 10. 3 ± 4. 9 (p＜ 0. 001) and 3. 5 ± 1. 2 to 2. 3 ± 1. 3 (p＜ 0. 001), respectively.

40|$|Purpose: The precise {{etiology}} and {{classification of}} nocturia in women is not enough. We evaluated age related changes and classified {{the type of}} nocturia by age in women. Methods: We included 118 women 20 years or older with nocturia at least one time during night time. Subjects were divided into three groups by the age: group 1, under 40 years; group 2, 40 through 59 years; group 3, 60 years and above. The causes of nocturia and its pattern changed by age in women were evaluated using 3 days frequency <b>volume</b> <b>chart.</b> Nocturia was devided into three types: nocturnal polyuria, decreased nocturnal bladder capacity and mixed type. Results: The mean age was 57. 2 ± 11. 8 and the mean nocturnal frequency was 2. 7 ± 1. 8. In all age group, noctural polyuria was the major cause for noturia (40. 8 %), followed by low nocturnal bladder capacity (23. 7 %).

Conclusions: Nocturnal polyuria and decreased nocturnal bladder capacity are the major causes of nocturia in women. Nocturnal polyuria was the major cause of nocturia with age over 60 years old.

However, the efficacy of this strategy has not been established. We tested the efficacy of nondrug lifestyle measures as a first step in treating nocturia and found factors predictive of the efficacy of the intervention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective evaluation of 56 patients treated at 3 hospitals between 2005 and 2009 for symptomatic nocturia. The patients were advised to modify their lifestyle to improve nocturia. Lifestyle modifications consisted of 4 directives of 1) restriction of fluid intake, 2) refraining from excess hours in bed, 3) moderate daily exercise and 4) keeping warm in bed. The frequency <b>volume</b> <b>chart,</b> International Prostate Symptom Score, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index before and 4 weeks after the intervention were used to evaluate the efficacy of the therapy.

SBNI was performed with a diathermy hook, always superficially (2 – 3 [*]mm) and unilaterally at 7 O’clock. Males that had SBNI during childhood after posterior urethral valve incision or relief of other obstruction between 1986 and 2003 were included.

The mean number of voiding episodes per night was measured as follows: 88 patients (31. 0 %) reported no nocturia, 60 patients (21. 1 %) reported 2 >voids/night ≥ 1, 56 patients (19. 7 %) reported 3 >voids/night ≥ 2, and 80 patients (28. 2 %) reported ≥ 3 voids/night. The mean number of nocturia episodes increased with age (P= 0. 001), and the number of nocturia episodes was significantly associated with the OAB-q symptom score (P= 0. 001) and symptom bother (P= 0. 001).

Although this is a good instrument for the assessment of functional bladder capacity, it is known that patient compliance could introduce problems. Therefore, we assessed whether uroflowmetry and post-void residual volume could replace FVC recordings in specific cases, by comparing the bladder capacity as measured by FVC or uroflowmetry. MethodsWe performed post-hoc analyses using data from a retrospective cohort study, in secondary/tertiary care. This included 907 patients between 2003 and 2013, aged 11 years, suffering from enuresis (1 wet night/fortnight). Data were collected from the medical files. Bland Altman plots were made to compare the two methods. ResultsAgreement between uroflowmetry and FVC was reasonable only when uroflowmetry was between 200 and 450 ml. ConclusionsFor individual clinical purposes, uroflowmetry can be used if values are in this range. For future research, we recommend to keep measuring bladder capacity with an FVC. Neurourol.
