The Office Controller was envisaged as a central switch which would interconnect and create all applications and make them available to users. PABX manufacturers of that era (the 1980s) created suites of data applications for the connection of users to mainframe applications. There were even magazine articles touting the victory of the PABX as an Office Controller over its LAN rivals. The PACX was a <b>data</b> <b>PABX</b> without the <b>voice</b> capability.|$|R

In this research, <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> was used to estimate HR, because it can easily be recorded using a common device such as smartphone. To evaluate the feasibility of HR estimation using recorded voice, experiments were conducted with two subjects. In the experiment, 60 sets of HRs and <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> were measured per subject. A correlation between HR and the vocal frequency was observed, and the feasibility of HR estimation using <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> was confirmed. The relationship between HR and <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> was modeled using a polynomial function of vocal frequency. Using the proposed model, HR could be estimated with high correlation coefficients and small estimation errors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Determining how to {{transport}} delay-sensitive <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> {{has long been}} a problem in multimedia networking. The difficulty arises because <b>voice</b> and best-effort <b>data</b> are different by nature. It would not be fair to give priority to voice traffic and starve its best-effort counterpart; however, the <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> delivered might not be perceptible if each voice call is limited to the rate of an average TCP flow. To address the problem, we approach it from a user-centric perspective by tuning the <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> rate based on user satisfaction. Our contribution in this work is threefold. First, we investigate how Skype, the largest and fastest growing VoIP service on the Internet, adapts its <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> rate (i. e., the redundancy ratio) to network conditions. Second, by exploiting implementations of public domain codecs, we discover that Skype’s mechanism is not really geared to user satisfaction. Third, based on a set of systematic experiments that quantify user satisfaction under different levels of packet loss and burstiness, we derive a concise model that allows user-centric redundancy control. The model can be easily incorporated into general VoIP services (not only Skype) to ensure consistent user satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a new innovative key exchange protocol for mobile VoIP devices. Further we analyze the existing key exchange protocols namely MIKEY, ZRTP and SDES and their vulnerability towards Man-In-The-Middle attack. The focused research area in VoIP {{is related to}} the Security and Quality of service of the <b>voice</b> <b>data.</b> Among these areas VoIP security and confidentiality of <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> turns to be a challenging one. As VoIP delivers the voice packet over the public internet, using the transparent IP protocol suite the confidentiality of the <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> is at risk. Moreover exchanging cryptographic keys to encrypt the media stream in the Session Initiation Protocol has proven to be quite difficult task. The existing key exchange protocols have been quite vulnerable to the Man-In-The-Middle attack. Therefore {{there is a need for}} stronger key management protocol which will secure the <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> from all types of attack and which also provides a feasible key exchange mechanism. In our approach we go for a two tier key exchange mechanism, in which the first tier involves ECDH for key seeding and the second tier involves a Key Generation Function (KGF), which takes care to the key update by consuming absolutely zero bandwidth. Here we take care to that this mechanism yields a very effective mechanism for preserving the confidentiality of the <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> without affecting the quality of the voice in Mobile Based VoIP devices...|$|R
