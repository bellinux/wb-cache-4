5|$|<b>Variegated</b> – Any form of mismatched, oddities in fur. Can be {{anything}} from broken or spotted hood or a misshaped blaze.|$|E
5|$|Vocal {{communication}} among <b>variegated</b> fairywrens is used primarily for communication between birds {{in a social}} group and for advertising and defending a territory. The basic song type is a high-pitched reel {{of a large number}} of short elements (10–20 per second); this lasts 1–4 seconds. The reel of the <b>variegated</b> fairywren is the softest of all malurids. Birds maintain contact with each other by tsst or seeee calls, while a short, sharp tsit serves as an alarm call.|$|E
5|$|F. rubiginosa is also {{suited for}} use as a houseplant in low, medium or brightly-lit spaces, {{although}} a <b>variegated</b> form requires brighter light. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. It is easily propagated by cuttings or aerial layering.|$|E
5|$|In his 1982 monograph, ornithologist Richard Schodde {{proposed}} a northern origin for the chestnut-shouldered fairywren group {{due to the}} variety of forms in north and their absence in the southeast of the continent. Ancestral birds spread south and colonised the southwest during a warm wetter period around 2 million {{years ago at the}} end of the Pliocene or beginning of the Pleistocene. Subsequent cooler and drier conditions resulted in loss of habitat and fragmentation of populations. Southwestern birds gave rise to what is now the red-winged fairywren, while those in the northwest of the continent became the <b>variegated</b> fairywren and yet another isolated in the northeast became the lovely fairywren. Further warmer, humid conditions again allowed birds to spread southwards, this group occupying central southern Australia east to the Eyre Peninsula became the blue-breasted fairywren. Cooler climate after this resulted in this being isolated as well and evolving into a separate species. Finally, after the end of the last glacial period 12,000–13,000years ago, the northern <b>variegated</b> forms have again spread southwards, resulting in the purple-backed subspecies assimilis. This has resulted in the <b>variegated</b> fairywren's range to overlap with all three other species. Schodde also proposed that the blue-grey coloured females of the lavender-flanked subspecies were ancestral, while the browner coloration of females of southern forms was an adaptation to dry climates. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified.|$|E

5|$|Like other fairywrens, male <b>variegated</b> fairywrens {{have been}} {{observed}} carrying brightly coloured petals to display to females {{as part of a}} courtship ritual. In this species, the petals that have been recorded have been yellow. Petals are displayed and presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the <b>variegated</b> fairywren is {{unrelated}} to the true wrens. Initially fairywrens {{were thought to be}} a member of the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae or warbler family Sylviidae, before being placed in the newly recognised Maluridae in 1975. More recently, DNA analysis has shown the family to be related to Meliphagidae (honeyeaters) and the Pardalotidae in a large superfamily Meliphagoidea.|$|E

5|$|The <b>variegated</b> fairywren (Malurus lamberti) is a fairywren {{that lives}} in diverse {{habitats}} across most of Australia. Four subspecies are recognised. In a species that exhibits sexual dimorphism, the brightly coloured breeding male has chestnut shoulders and azure crown and ear coverts, while non-breeding males, females and juveniles have predominantly grey-brown plumage, although females of the subspecies rogersi and dulcis (previously termed lavender-flanked fairywren) have mainly blue-grey plumage.|$|E
5|$|The <b>variegated</b> fairywren {{was officially}} {{described}} by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827, {{and was at}} first considered a colour variant of the superb fairywren. The scientific name commemorates the British collector Aylmer Bourke Lambert. It is one of 12 species of the genus Malurus, commonly known as fairywrens, found in Australia and lowland New Guinea. Within the genus it belongs {{to a group of}} four very similar species known collectively as the chestnut-shouldered fairywrens. The other three species are localised residents in restricted regions of Australia: the lovely fairywren (M. amabilis) of Cape York, the red-winged fairywren (M. elegans) of the southwest corner of Western Australia, and the blue-breasted fairywren (M. pulcherrimus) of southern Western Australia and the Eyre Peninsula. A 2011 analysis by Amy Driskell and colleagues of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found that the lovely fairywren was nested within the <b>variegated</b> fairywren complex, and was the sister taxon of the purple-backed subspecies assimilis.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the forest}} habitat, the red-winged fairywren prefers wetter gullies and {{riverside}} sword sedge (Lepidosperma effusum). It borders {{the range of}} the <b>variegated</b> fairywren on the northern limit of its range, and the blue-breasted fairywren in the eastern limit, with the latter two species occupying dryer scrub while the red-winged fairywren is restricted to wetter forests. The lack of intermediate forms reinforces the status of all three taxa as separate species.|$|E

Molecular study showed the blue-breasted fairywren to be the most closely related to the red-winged fairywren.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile Caribbean reef {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger sharks {{such as the}} tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) and the bull shark (C. leucas). Few parasites are known for this species; one is a dark <b>variegated</b> leech often seen {{trailing}} from its first dorsal fin. Off northern Brazil, juveniles seek out cleaning stations occupied by yellownose gobies (Elacatinus randalli), which clean the sharks of parasites while they lie still on the bottom. Horse-eye jacks (Caranx latus) and bar jacks (Carangoides ruber) routinely school around Caribbean reef sharks.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the <b>variegated</b> fairywren is a {{cooperative}} breeding species, with {{small groups of}} birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females {{as part of a}} courtship display. These birds are primarily insectivorous and forage and live in the shelter of scrubby vegetation across 90% of continental Australia, which is a wider range than that of any other fairywren.|$|E
5|$|Major nest predators include Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbirds (Cracticus spp.), {{laughing}} kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), and shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.), {{as well as}} introduced mammals such as the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), feral {{cats and}} black rat (Rattus rattus). The <b>variegated</b> fairywren readily adopts a 'rodent-run' display to distract predators from nests with young birds. The head, neck and tail are lowered, the wings are held out and the feathers are fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call.|$|E
5|$|The <b>variegated</b> fairywren is a {{cooperative}} breeding species, with pairs or {{small groups of}} birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. Though less studied than the superb- and splendid fairywrens, it is presumably socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, with each partner mating with other individuals. Females and males feed young equally, while helper birds assist in defending the territory and feeding and rearing the young. Birds in a group roost side-by-side in dense cover as well as engage in mutual preening. Occasionally larger groups of around 10 birds have been recorded, though {{it is unclear whether}} this was incidental or a defined flock.|$|E
5|$|Like all fairywrens, the <b>variegated</b> fairywren is {{an active}} and restless feeder, {{particularly}} on open ground near shelter, but also through the lower foliage. Movement {{is a series of}} jaunty hops and bounces, its balance assisted by a relatively large tail, which is usually held upright, and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts. During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during the heat of the day. Food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.|$|E
5|$|The red-winged fairywren (Malurus elegans) is {{a species}} of {{passerine}} bird in the family Maluridae. It is sedentary and endemic to the southwestern corner of Western Australia. Exhibiting {{a high degree of}} sexual dimorphism, the male adopts a brilliantly coloured breeding plumage, with an iridescent silvery-blue crown, ear coverts and upper back, red shoulders, contrasting with a black throat, grey-brown tail and wings and pale underparts. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles have predominantly grey-brown plumage, though males may bear isolated blue and black feathers. No separate subspecies are recognised. Similar in appearance and closely related to the <b>variegated</b> fairywren (M. lamberti) and the blue-breasted fairywren (M. pulcherrimus), it is regarded as a separate species as no intermediate forms have been recorded where ranges overlap. Though the red-winged fairywren is locally common, there is evidence of a decline in numbers.|$|E
5|$|Numerous cultivars of C.australis {{are sold}} within New Zealand {{and around the}} world. Like other Cordyline species, C.australis can produce sports which have very {{attractive}} colouration, including pink stripes and leaves in various shades of green, yellow or red. An early cultivar was published in France and England in 1870: Cordyline australis 'Lentiginosa' was described as having tinted leaves with brownish red spots. Other early cultivars included 'Veitchii' (1871) with crimson midribs, 'Atrosanguinea' (1882) with bronze leaves infused with red, 'Atropurpurea' (1886) and 'Purpurea' (1890) with purple leaves, {{and a range of}} <b>variegated</b> forms: 'Doucetiana' (1878), 'Argento-striata' (1888) and 'Dalleriana' (1890). In New Zealand and overseas, hybrids with other Cordyline species feature prominently in the range of cultivars available. New Plymouth plant breeders Duncan and Davies included hybrids of C.australis and C.banksii in their 1925 catalogue, and have produced many new cultivars since. In New Zealand, some of the coloured forms and hybrids seem to be more susceptible to attacks from the cabbage tree moth.|$|E

25|$|In most tinamou species, {{the males}} {{practice}} simultaneous polygyny and the females sequential polyandry. This is not invariable; ornate tinamous form stable pairs, and spotted nothuras are monogamous when young and polygamous when older.
