40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} students’ <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the orientation of science and to investigate the relationship between their <b>views</b> and decision-making <b>on</b> socio-scientific issues (SSI). In this study, 27 university students attending a science course were asked to discuss four controversial issues: the Toyota recall, the green car, the global warming and swine influenza (influenza A (H 1 N 1)). The study was comprised of two stages. At the first stage, we examined students’ <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the nature of science and on the orientation of science with the open-ended questionnaire based on VNOS and VOSTS. While they held relatively similar <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the nature of science, their <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the orientation of science were distinct as pragmatic, intrinsic, communal and ethical views. At the second stage, to examine the role of their <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the orientation of science in decision-making, we selected four students who had similar <b>views</b> <b>on</b> NOS but different <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the orientation of science. The four students were selected from each group of <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the orientation of science and their decision-making processes were analyzed following grounded theory. Across SSIs, they relied upon their <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the orientation of science as the strategies for decision, though considered different perception, and causal and contextual conditions. This study indicates that understanding students’ <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the orientation of science would be helpful for achieving scientific literacy for informed decision...|$|R

5|$|French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir {{provided}} a Marxist solution and an existentialist <b>view</b> <b>on</b> {{many of the}} questions of feminism with the publication of Le Deuxième Sexe (The Second Sex) in 1949. The book expressed feminists' sense of injustice. Second-wave feminism is a feminist movement beginning in the early 1960s and continuing to the present; as such, it coexists with third-wave feminism. Second-wave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage, such as ending gender discrimination.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent discoveries and {{analyses}} upheld Sternberg's <b>view</b> <b>on</b> {{the position of}} Triceratops, with Lehman defining both subfamilies in 1990 and diagnosing Triceratops as ceratopsine (chasmosaurine of his usage) {{on the basis of}} several morphological features. In fact, it fits well into the ceratopsine subfamily, apart from its one feature of a shortened frill. Further research by Peter Dodson, including a 1990 cladistic analysis and a 1993 study using RFTRA (resistant-fit theta-rho analysis), a morphometric technique which systematically measures similarities in skull shape, reinforces Triceratops placement in the ceratopsine subfamily.|$|E
40|$|This study reviews {{international}} {{comparative studies}} investigating people’s <b>views</b> <b>on</b> inequality. These studies are classified using a framework consisting of {{three types of}} conceptions of inequality and two dimensions of inequality. Four perspectives are discussed explaining cross-national differences in <b>views</b> <b>on</b> inequality: the modernist, the culturalist, the micro and the macro perspective. The findings of studies comparing <b>views</b> <b>on</b> inequalities in post-communist and Western states provide more support for the modernist than for the culturalist perspective. Few comparative studies appear to investigate <b>views</b> <b>on</b> inequalities as independent variables impacting on other social attitudes and behaviours. It is argued that the social relevance of the field will be enhanced if more studies can show that <b>views</b> <b>on</b> inequality {{have an effect on}} social outcomes complementary to that of objective inequalities...|$|R
40|$|While most {{remember}} Augustine (354 - 430 AD) as theologian, exegete, and philosopher, {{the purpose}} of this essay is to consider Augustine’s legacy and ministry as teacher. After his conversion (386 AD), Augustine’s <b>views</b> <b>on</b> teaching took a turn. His theological convictions thus set the course for his <b>views</b> <b>on</b> teaching throughout the rest of his life. It is to such <b>views</b> <b>on</b> teaching that this essay seeks to examine. Therefore this essay will wrestle through Augustine’s <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the role of the teacher and the learner and the link between the two, his theological basis for teaching, and some of the methods he used in teaching. Having established these crucial points, it will be argued that Augustine’s <b>views</b> <b>on</b> the role of teacher have significant implications for Christian educators today...|$|R
