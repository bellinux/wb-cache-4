However, such assessment methods have not, hitherto, been utilised in London Metropolitan University’s Journalism education programme.

This article will examine why this variety seems not to {{be reflected in the}} assessment regimes of associated journalism education programmes and will also raise the following questions: is this simply a preference that may need to be challenged, and, more provocatively, does it therefore suggest a lack of desire amongst Journalism educators to innovate?

5000|$|Wanning {{is today}} most noted for being [...] "the first Protestant {{composer}} to write cycles of de tempore motets {{for the whole}} church year," [...] and his work inspired a number of later composers to create similar cycles of Evangelienmotetten or Spruchmotetten. He composed over 100 motets in Latin, published between 1580 and 1590. They were published in two cycles, the first appearing in two parts published in 1580 and 1584 respectively (and republished in 1590) and the latter published in 1590. The first volume, Sacrae Cantiones quinque, sex, septem et octo voces compositae, et tum <b>vivae</b> <b>voces,</b> tum musicis instrumentis aptatae, contains twenty-seven motets for six voices, for saints' days and festivals. A further fifty-two motets are contained in the second volume, Sententiae insigniores quinque, sex et septem voces ex evangeliis dominicalibus excerptae atque modulis musicis ornatae, for from five to seven voices. They were to be sung on days from the first Sunday in Advent through to the twenty-fifth Sunday after Trinity. They {{have been described as}} [...] "lively" [...] by Hans J.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} financial education trends and innovations {{in the academic}} literature that can be translated in an investor education strategy shared by all national stakeholders. Policy makers {{would be interested in}} the following considerations that raise to strategic asset educational programs for retail investors. The instrument used for the survey was a detailed analysis of the doctrine and three structured interviews at CONSOB, Bank of Italy and Feduf. The first part focuses on the definition of financial education, as financial interdisciplinary branch that combines aspects of cognitive psychology and financial theories, and as complementary tool for soft law to the regulation and supervision. Then it seeks to understand the degree of financial miseducation over investment contracts and how we can generate a virtuous circle from this. Since the critical issues of the financial system are {{due in part to the}} type of rules on transparency between broker and client, it is key to investigate the cognitive techniques of individuals, reconciling the needs of investor protection with the development of the activity trade and provision of investment services. In this area we have to draw and implant investor education projects. In the dissertation there is a study on all the preliminary investigations that Governments, international organizations and private Authority should take to generate a systematic program. After those different educational approaches are enucleated and deepened (from the gamefication nudging, and different degrees of empowerment), always keeping in mind the financial education purpose: ensuring everyone comprehension to be an irrational agent with enough capacity/knowledge to make efficient economic decisions with the fewest number of mistakes. Through <b>vivae</b> <b>voces</b> of institutions and industry people, it finally understands how national strategies should define a global and cross-sectoral vision and to set realistic and logical overall targets with policy priorities...|$|R

Finally in 1646 he published a version of the History that was slightly over half the length of the original.

This damaged Buck's scholarly reputation for centuries.
