5|$|Though {{some groups}} {{advocate}} total sexual abstinence, {{by which they}} mean the avoidance of all sexual activity, {{in the context of}} birth control the term usually means abstinence from <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse.</b> Abstinence is 100% effective in preventing pregnancy; however, not everyone who intends to be abstinent refrains from all sexual activity, and in many populations there is a significant risk of pregnancy from nonconsensual sex.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the G-spot has not been proven, nor has the source of female ejaculation. Although the G-spot has been studied since the 1940s, disagreement persists over its existence as a distinct structure, definition and location. A 2009 British study concluded that its existence is unproven and subjective, based on questionnaires and personal experience. Other studies, using ultrasound, have found physiological evidence of the G-spot in women who report having orgasms during <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse.</b> It is also hypothesized that the G-spot {{is an extension of}} the clitoris and that this is the cause of orgasms experienced vaginally.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{proposed}} high-risk transmission channels, {{allowing the}} virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout the society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to circa 1910. Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic {{with the emergence of}} colonialism and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of sexual promiscuity, the spread of prostitution, and the concomitant high frequency of genital ulcer diseases (such as syphilis) in nascent colonial cities. While transmission rates of HIV during <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse</b> are typically low, they are increased many fold if one of the partners suffers from a sexually transmitted infection resulting in genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable due to their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers to the degree that as of 1928 as many as 45% of female residents of eastern Leopoldville were thought to have been prostitutes and as of 1933 around 15% of all residents of the same city were infected by one of the forms of syphilis.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Sex workers (SW) clients {{represent}} a bridge population for HIV transmission from high risk to low risk general population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional anonymous telephone survey {{was carried out}} at the AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections Helpline of National Institute of Health in Italy. The questionnaire was proposed {{on a voluntary basis}} to a sample of 119 subjects from helpline users. RESULTS: The 119 participants were all males, aged between 19 and 59 years and mostly accessed female prostitutes. <b>Vaginal</b> <b>intercourses</b> with SW were more frequently reported, followed by passive oral, active oral sex and active anal intercourses. Cumulatively, 86. 6 % and 84. 6 % of <b>vaginal</b> and anal <b>intercourses</b> were respectively reported as regularly protected by condom. DISCUSSION: The telephone interview allowed an eased access, a high response rate and a standardised evaluation of questions CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary a constant monitoring of the characteristics, behaviour, risk perception and testing of SW clients in Italian and other populations...|$|R

25|$|If {{a victim}} is under 14 and the {{offender}} at least 4 years older, and {{they engage in}} a sex act (oral, anal and other sex acts, but not <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse),</b> that constitutes a sexual offense in the second degree. If they engage in <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse,</b> that constitutes rape in the second degree. If they have sexual contact (kissing, touching for sexual gratification), that constitutes a sexual offense in the third degree.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of factors that make {{male-to-female}} anal intercourse riskier for a female than for a male. For example, besides the risk of HIV transmission being higher for anal intercourse than for <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse,</b> the risk of injury to the woman during anal intercourse is significantly higher than the risk of injury to her during <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse</b> because of the durability of the vaginal tissues compared to the anal tissues. Additionally, if a man moves from anal intercourse immediately to <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse</b> without a condom or without changing it, infections can arise in the vagina (or urinary tract) due to bacteria present within the anus; these infections can also result from switching between vaginal sex and anal sex by the use of fingers or sex toys.|$|E
25|$|Other {{studies suggest}} that women exposed to lower levels of {{prenatal}} androgens {{are more likely to}} experience orgasm during <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse</b> than other women.|$|E

25|$|The {{infection}} is usually spread {{from one person}} to another through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Men have a 20% risk of getting the infection from a single act of <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse</b> with an infected woman. The risk for men that have sex with men (MSM) is higher. Active MSM may get a penile infection, while passive MSM may get anorectal gonorrhea. Women have a 60–80% risk of getting the infection from a single act of <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse</b> with an infected man. A pregnant women can pass on the infection to her unborn infant.|$|E
25|$|The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth {{has found}} that, while pledgers {{are more likely}} to abstain until {{marriage}} than non-pledgers – 99% of whom will have sex before marriage – 88% of the pledgers studied had <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse</b> before marriage. Out of those who pledge, there was a significant delay in first experience with <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse,</b> with an average delay of 18 months. However, people who took a virginity pledge were found to be less likely to have protected sex upon initiation and less likely to get STI tested if a concern arose.|$|E

50|$|Insufficient {{lubrication}} or {{vaginal dryness}} in women can cause dyspareunia, {{which is a}} type of sexual pain disorder. While vaginal dryness is considered an indicator for sexual arousal disorder, male circumcision exacerbates female <b>vaginal</b> dryness during <b>intercourse.</b> <b>Vaginal</b> dryness may also result from insufficient excitement and stimulation or from hormonal changes caused by menopause (potentially causing atrophic vaginitis), pregnancy, or breast-feeding. Irritation from contraceptive creams and foams can also cause dryness, as can fear and anxiety about sexual intimacy. Vaginal dryness can also be a symptom of Sjögren's syndrome (SS), a chronic autoimmune disorder in which the body destroys moisture-producing glands.|$|R
25|$|While {{some women}} find being a {{receptive}} partner during anal intercourse painful or uncomfortable, or only {{engage in the}} act to please a male sexual partner, other women find the activity pleasurable or prefer it to <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse.</b>|$|E
25|$|For a {{woman to}} conceive, certain things have to happen: <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse</b> must take place around the time when an egg is {{released}} from her ovary; the system that produces eggs has to be working at optimum levels; and her hormones must be balanced.|$|E
25|$|Anal {{intercourse}} {{is sometimes}} {{used as a}} substitute for <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse</b> during menstruation. The likelihood of pregnancy occurring during anal sex is greatly reduced, as anal sex alone cannot lead to pregnancy unless sperm is somehow transported to the vaginal opening. Because of this, some couples practice anal intercourse as a form of contraception, often {{in the absence of a}} condom.|$|E
30|$|Consistent use of {{a condom}} in <b>vaginal</b> sexual <b>intercourse</b> (in the {{previous}} 2  months) was calculated. To do this, first, the proportion of condom use in <b>vaginal</b> sexual <b>intercourse</b> in the previous 2  months was calculated, dividing the number of vaginal sexual relations using a condom {{by the total number}} of vaginal sexual relations. Then, the variable proportion of condom use in vaginal sexual relations over the previous 2  months was dichotomized, so that values equal to 1 indicated consistent use of condoms and values below 1 indicated inconsistent use of condoms. The same approach was used to calculate consistency of condom use in anal sexual intercourse (in the previous 2  months). To establish resilience levels (high, medium, and low), the 25 th (low level) and 75 th (high level) percentiles were considered. Scores between 25 th and 75 th percentiles were considered as medium level. We decided not to stratify the sample according to sexual orientation since it was a convenience and intentional sample, so the sample was not large enough for such analysis.|$|R
40|$|Many HIV serodiscordant {{couples have}} {{a strong desire to}} have their own {{biological}} children. Natural conception may be the only choice in some resource limited settings but data about natural conception is limited. Here, we reported our findings of natural conception in HIV serodiscordant couples. Between January 2008 and June 2014, we retrospectively collected data on 91 HIV serodiscordant couples presenting to Beijing Youan Hospital with childbearing desires. HIV counseling, effective ART on HIV infected partners, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in negative female partners and timed intercourse were used to maximally reduce the risk of HIV transmission. Of the 91 HIV serodiscordant couples, 43 were positive in male partners and 48 were positive in female partners. There were 196 unprotected <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourses,</b> 100 natural conception and 97 newborns. There were no cases of HIV seroconversion in uninfected sexual partners. Natural conception may be an acceptable option in HIV-serodiscordant couples in resource limited settings if HIV-positive individuals have undetectable viremia on HAART, combined with HIV counseling, PrEP, PEP and timed intercourse...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Clients of {{sex workers}} {{represent}} a relevant target for interventions {{aimed at the}} prevention of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Within prevention strategies, the AIDS and sexually transmitted infections helpline (Telefono Verde AIDS/ IST, TVA-IST) of National Institute of Health in Italy has provided, since 1987, specific information and counselling interventions. AIM: The present study reports data on anagraphical characteristics and behaviours of clients of sex workers, anonymously reported at TVA-IST in the period 1987 - 2010. DISCUSSION: Among 95 149 phone calls (14 % of the total) considered 99. 5 % came from males, over 80 % aged under 37 years and prevalently from Northern Italy. Among sexual behaviours, unprotected sexual intercourses were reported in the 26 % of the calls. Subjects under 27 years reported a higher frequency of unprotected anal intercourse, while they used protection with oral and <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourses</b> in {{a greater extent than}} older ones. Due to differential behaviours within clients of sex workers, specific informative strategies for this targeted population should adequately consider age-related differences...|$|R
25|$|If {{a victim}} is 14 or 15 and the {{offender}} at least 4 {{years older than}} the victim, that constitutes a sexual offense in the fourth degree. If the offender is at least 21 years old, and they engage in <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse</b> or other sexual acts (including oral and anal sex), that constitutes a sexual offense in the third degree.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2010 {{study from}} the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB) that was {{authored}} by Debby Herbenick et al., although anal intercourse is reported by fewer women than other partnered sex behaviors, partnered women in the age groups between 18–49 are {{significantly more likely to}} report having anal sex in the past 90 days. Women engaged in anal intercourse less commonly than men. <b>Vaginal</b> <b>intercourse</b> was practiced more than insertive anal intercourse among men, but 13% to 15% of men aged 25 to 49 practiced insertive anal intercourse.|$|E
25|$|The hymen is a {{membrane}} {{of tissue}} that surrounds or partially covers the vaginal opening. The effects of <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse</b> and childbirth on the hymen are variable. If the hymen is sufficiently elastic, it may return to nearly its original condition. In other cases, {{there may be}} remnants (carunculae myrtiformes), or it may appear completely absent after repeated penetration. Additionally, the hymen may be lacerated by disease, injury, medical examination, masturbation or physical exercise. For these reasons, {{it is not possible}} to definitively determine whether or not a girl or woman is a virgin by examining her hymen.|$|E

25|$|Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STI), {{also referred}} to as sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and venereal diseases (VD), are infections that are commonly spread by sex, especially <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse,</b> anal sex or oral sex. Most STIs initially do not cause symptoms. This results in a greater risk of passing the disease on to others. Symptoms and signs of disease may include vaginal discharge, penile discharge, ulcers on or around the genitals, and pelvic pain. STIs acquired before or during birth may result in poor outcomes for the baby. Some STIs may cause problems with the ability to get pregnant.|$|E
25|$|The {{transmission}} of HIV is frequently {{a major concern}} of the patient. Prophylactic treatment for HIV is not necessarily administered. Routine treatment for HIV after rape or sexual assault is controversial due to the low risk of infection after one sexual assault. Transmission of HIV after one exposure to penetrative anal sex {{is estimated to be}} 0.5 to 3.2 percent. Transmission of HIV after one exposure to penetrative <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse</b> is 0.05 to 0.15 percent. HIV can also be contracted through the oral route but is considered rare. Other recommendations are that the patient be treated prophylactically for HIV if the perpetrator is found to be infected.|$|E
25|$|The film {{told the}} story of a wealthy San Francisco socialite, Gloria Saunders (Chambers), who is taken against her will to an elite North Beach sex club and loved as she's never been loved before. Unusually, Chambers does not have a single word of {{dialogue}} in the entire film. After engaging in lesbian sex with a group of six women, she has sex with the African-American boxer Johnny Keyes. This possibly makes Behind the Green Door the first U.S. feature-length hardcore film to include an interracial sex scene. The porn industry and viewing public were shocked by the then-taboo spectacle of a white woman having sex with a black man. The scene with Keyes is followed by Chambers mounting a trapeze contraption suspended from the ceiling. She then engages in <b>vaginal</b> <b>intercourse</b> with one man as she performs oral sex on another and masturbates two others.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{the association between}} early sexual debut and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have mainly focused on Africans or females but rarely on {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) in China. This study, therefore, mainly aimed at exploring the association between early sexual debut and HIV infection among MSM in Shenzhen, China. A total of 533 MSM were enrolled in this study using a convenience sampling method. Information about sociodemographic characteristics and risky sexual behaviors was collected. It was found that the prevalence of HIV infection was 24. 2 % among this study population and 66. 4 % of the MSM reported having had <b>vaginal</b> sexual <b>intercourse</b> with females. The mean ages at first <b>vaginal</b> sexual <b>intercourse,</b> first anal sexual intercourse, and first sexual intercourse were 21. 38, 22. 43, and 19. 87 years, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that the MSM who experienced early anal sexual debut were more likely to be infected with HIV than those who did not. The results indicate that HIV infection is quite prevalent among MSM in Shenzhen. Early and efficient intervention strategies should be taken, and the MSM experiencing early anal sexual debut should be given special attention...|$|R
