40|$|All {{too often}} {{interest}} in the industrialization of housing {{is concerned with the}} product rather than the process. Much effort has gone into the design and manufacture of many different building systems and yet, to date, industrialization has made little impact on the building industry. The manufacturer has been unable to aggregate an adequate market to sustain sufficient production to justify the industrialization of the building process. The complete process of manufacture and distribution must be considered if a successful system is to be designed for industrialization. An understanding of the implications of [...] the present constraints, the concept of the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>in</b> <b>manufacture,</b> the available methods and costs of product distribution, the limitations to successful market aggregation [...] is necessary to the determination of the final product design. This thesis demonstrates that by rationalizing these factors into a complete system of manufacture, distribution and construction it is possible to successfully overcome the obstacles of market aggregation to the realization of the successful industrialization of housing. The thesis concludes that working within the framework of present-day transportation capabilities and costs, the core and panel method of manufacture and construction offers the housing manufacturer an economically effective means for furnishing industrialized housing without limiting his choice of transportation method...|$|E
40|$|Log {{conversion}} processes {{currently in}} use are, {{for the most}} part, batch processes based on sawing or rotary peeling of logs, leading to direct correspondence between the size {{and quality of the}} raw material and the size and quality of the resulting product. Since the engineering capabilities of such products are also dependent on their size and quality, a higher value is imputed to those logs from which these products can be made, i. e., larger logs of higher grade. In recent decades, rising price differentials between timber grades, relative to product prices, have reduced the profit margin on traditional conversion processes, contributing to the development of new technologies. ^ Simulation was used to project the value added to different log grades when used to produce structural products through alternative conversion methods. The results obtained indicate that resource scarcity (as reflected by log prices) provides a strong impetus for the development and adoption of improvements in the methods of converting logs into structural products. Additionally, value added trends appear to provide an adequate signal of technological change. ^ For the traditional conversion technologies of sawing and peeling, value added is projected to decrease over time for both Douglas-fir and southern pine. In general, the value added in log conversion improved as log grade declined, and the most favorable value added trends for commodity structural items were observed when these products were obtained from the lower grade logs. Technological improvements designed to increase lumber yields resulted in higher value added figures than with older technologies, but the trend lines still decreased with time. For aspen waferboard and OSB, products whose size and quality does not depend on resource size and quality, <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>in</b> <b>manufacture</b> was projected to increase over time. A simple sensitivity analysis to observe the effects of possible increases in raw material prices indicated that aspen pulpwood prices could rise by a significant amount and still result in an increasing value added trend for most thicknesses of waferboard and OSB panels. ...|$|E
3000|$|... “TP” {{stands for}} the measure of {{domestic}} trade policy liberalization. Concerning the theoretical impact of domestic trade policy liberalization on resource revenue, the literature has demonstrated that trade policy liberalization can exert either a positive or {{a negative effect on}} public revenue, depending on several factors, including the structure of trade liberalization and the effect of the latter on each component of public revenue (e.g., Ebrill et al. 1999; Agbeyegbe et al. 2006). On the one hand, trade policy liberalization could attract resource-seeking FDI inflows that intend to exploit natural resources, with a view to exporting them to their home countries (these natural resources may be used as inputs in the production process of final goods in the home countries) or to export the final products to the international trade market. This may in turn result in higher resource revenue if the government of the host country does not exempt MNEs from paying revenue on the exploitation of these resources. At the same time, the host country’s government can exempt resource-seeking MNEs (that intends to exploit and process the natural resource in the host country) from paying resource revenue if it intends to diversify its public revenue sources, notably through higher non-resource revenue mobilization, which is ultimately a more stable and sustainable public revenue source. Trade policy liberalization could particularly enhance the mobilization of higher non-resource revenue by, inter alia, promoting higher <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>in</b> the <b>manufactured</b> products—including the processing of natural resources that are sold either in the domestic market and/or exported abroad—and facilitating export diversification (see Gnangnon and Brun 2017). The literature on the determinants of public revenue has established that a higher <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>in</b> <b>manufactured</b> products (<b>in</b> % of total output) generates higher non-resource revenue (e.g., Thomas and Treviño 2013; Brun et al. 2015; Gnangnon and Brun 2017). Overall, it is difficult to anticipate the (average) impact of trade policy liberalization on the share of resource revenue in total public revenue, as this impact depends {{on the extent to which}} such liberalization influences non-resource revenue relative to resource revenue. Nevertheless, we postulate that the positive impact of trade policy liberalization on non-resource revenue would likely be higher than the one on resource revenue, so that trade policy liberalization would ultimately be associated with a higher extent of change in the structure of public revenue, i.e., a lower resource revenue share of total public revenue. It is worth recalling that a positive or a negative average impact across the full sample could reflect various impacts across countries in the sample. For example, during the last sub-period (2012 – 2015) of the analysis, the countries that experience the lowest level of trade policy liberalization include Iran, Zimbabwe, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, and Sudan.|$|R

40|$|Diamond mining in Canada {{began in}} 1998, {{with the first}} {{production}} from the Ekati mine in the Northwest Territories. Since then the Diavik mine has begun production, and two other mines are slated to begin production within two years. Canada’s share of the world value of diamond production was 15 per cent in 2003, the third largest worldwide. These mines are all located in the northern regions of Canada, and hence contribute substantially {{to the growth of}} these regions. Diamond production accounted for 19. 9 per cent of total real output in the Northwest Territories in 2002, representing a phenomenal impact, especially given that the industry did not exist five years before. Given the very high level of output per hour in the diamond mining industry ?reflecting a high degree of economic rent ?and the strong expected growth of the industry in the coming years, the labour productivity growth of the overall mining industry will be favourably affected. Based on a rough simulation of the growth of the Canadian diamond mining industry in the 2001 - 2006 period, average annual labour productivity growth in the overall mining industry will be between one and two percentage points higher than if the diamond mining industry did not exist. Although the mining of rough diamonds is lucrative in itself, there is also much <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>in</b> the <b>manufacture</b> and retailing of diamond jewelry.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Oregon's {{forest product}} {{industry}} {{continues to be}} the nation's number one producer of wood products. The forest products industry contributes significantly to Oregon's economy. Changes in timber supply, land use policy, technology, and product demand create significant impacts on the region. The activities of the wood products industry translate into jobs, payroll, taxes, and the purchase of services and materials from other industries. In order to trace the contribution of the wood products industry to the state of Oregon's economy, a thorough understanding of how wood is utilized at all subsequent stages of processing is necessary. This study provides an in-depth look at the forest products industry by estimating the volume of wood, number of jobs, and value added of product shipments at each stage of processing, from harvest to final product. The forest products industry as defined in this study includes six primary wood processing industries: sawmills; veneer and plywood mills; pulp and board mills; shake and shingle mills; pole, post & piling mills; and log export firms. Seven secondary and/or residue converting industries are included: structural members, which produce engineered wood products such as laminated veneer, glu-lam beams, and I-joist; millwork; furniture; materials handling, which includes pallets, dunnage and other products used in shipping; reconstituted wood products, such as particle and hard board; converted paper and board products; and miscellaneous wood products. Forestry services and regeneration, logging operations, and hauling are also included to the extent possible. The results of this study indicate the forest products industry in Oregon supported in excess of 80, 000 jobs and provided <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>in</b> <b>manufacture</b> of more than 5. 2 billion dollars in 1992. The estimated harvest volume in 1992 was 1, 409. 4 million cubic feet and 1, 547. 1 million cubic feet of logs were consumed in Oregon primary wood products industries. The employment numbers in this study are not directly comparable to other studies because the definition of "wood products industries" may be broader than in other reports. Using the traditional definitions of SIC 24 (lumber and wood products) and SIC 26, (paper and allied products) 63, 000 people were employed in wood products industries in 1992...|$|E

40|$|As {{domestic}} exports usually require imported inputs, {{the value}} of exports differs from the domestic <b>value</b> <b>added</b> contained <b>in</b> exports. The higher the domestic <b>value</b> <b>added</b> contained <b>in</b> exports, the higher the domestic national income created by exports will be. In this case, exports will expand the domestic market. Therefore, exports will push economic growth in two ways: through their direct effect on aggregate demand, and through their effect on the domestic market. For these reasons, the estimate {{of the magnitude of}} the domestic <b>value</b> <b>added</b> contained <b>in</b> exports helps explain the capacity of exports to lead economic growth. Domestic exports may be classified as direct and indirect exports. Direct exports are the goods sold to other countries; indirect exports are the domestically produced inputs incorporated in direct exports. The distinction between direct and indirect exports leads to a distinction between direct and indirect domestic <b>value</b> <b>added</b> contained <b>in</b> exports. The income of the factors directly involved in the production of exports constitutes direct domestic value added; the income contained in domestically produced inputs incorporated into exports constitutes the indirect domestic <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> Therefore, the magnitude of indirect <b>value</b> <b>added</b> depends on the density of the domestic intersectorial linkages. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present an estimation of the domestic indirect <b>value</b> <b>added</b> contained <b>in</b> Mexico's manufacturing exports in two ways. The first derives from the fact that a direct exporting sector may be the vehicle through which other sectors export in an indirect way; this leads us to estimate the indirect <b>value</b> <b>added</b> contained <b>in</b> exports by sector of origin. The second refers to the destination of this indirect <b>value</b> <b>added</b> - that is, to the direct exporting sectors <b>in</b> which the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> contained <b>in</b> indirect exports of each sector appears. Based on the input-output table for Mexico (National Institute of Statistics and Geography-INEGI 2008), we estimate the domestic <b>value</b> <b>added</b> contained <b>in</b> inputs used to produce Mexican manufacturing exports. We show separately the domestic <b>value</b> <b>added</b> from maquiladora exports and from exports produced by the rest of the manufacturing sector.
