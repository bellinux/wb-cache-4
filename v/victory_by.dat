25|$|In a tournament, most of {{the team}} points are scored for advancement. For example, a team winning a match in the {{championship}} bracket would be awarded one team advancement point; one-half of an advancement point would be awarded if a team won a match in the wrestle-back bracket. The corresponding team points also apply if a wrestler from the team gained a bye and then won his next match in that bracket. Two additional advancement points are for <b>victories</b> <b>by</b> fall, default, disqualification, and forfeit (including <b>victories</b> <b>by</b> medical forfeit). One and one-half additional advancement points are awarded for <b>victories</b> <b>by</b> technical fall with near fall points scored {{in the course of}} the match. One additional advancement point is awarded for <b>victories</b> <b>by</b> technical fall <b>victories</b> with no near fall points scored during the course of the match and also for <b>victories</b> <b>by</b> major decision. A team could then win a certain number of placement points if its wrestlers have placed individually in the championship and wrestle-back brackets. Thus, whole teams are awarded placements (first, second, etc.) based on their total number of victories.|$|R
