Lazur has given several reasons to explain his willingness to restart the project, including his experience coding for the Dreamcast <b>Visual</b> <b>Memory</b> Unit, programming for game developer DC Studios, and playing Chrono Cross, the official sequel to Chrono Trigger for PlayStation. Unlike CT64, the second version would be a short demo developed in a cross-platform engine with a single 3D playing mode. The Windows version was planned for a free Internet release, while Nintendo GameCube and Xbox ports would be reserved for official developers with access to development kits of {{either of the two}} consoles.|$|E
5|$|Individuals with AS {{often have}} {{excellent}} auditory and visual perception. Children with ASD often demonstrate enhanced perception of {{small changes in}} patterns such as arrangements of objects or well-known images; typically this is domain-specific and involves processing of fine-grained features. Conversely, compared with individuals with high-functioning autism, individuals with AS have deficits in some tasks involving visual-spatial perception, auditory perception, or <b>visual</b> <b>memory.</b> Many accounts of individuals with AS and ASD report other unusual sensory and perceptual skills and experiences. They may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound, light, and other stimuli; these sensory responses are found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to AS or to ASD. There is little support for increased fight-or-flight response or failure of habituation in autism; there is more evidence of decreased responsiveness to sensory stimuli, although several studies show no differences.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{findings}} suggest that <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> preferentially remembers angry looking faces. However, the meaning of facial actions is construed in relation to context. To date, there are no studies investigating the role of perceiver-based context when processing emotional cues in <b>visual</b> working <b>memory.</b> To {{explore the influence of}} affective context on <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> for faces, we conducted two experiments using both a <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> task for emotionally expressive faces and a mood induction procedure. Affective context was manipulated by unpleasant (Experiment 1) and pleasant (Experiment 2) IAPS pictures in order to induce an affect high in motivational intensity (defensive or appetitive, respectively) compared to a low arousal control condition. Results indicated specifically increased sensitivity of <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> for angry looking faces in the neutral condition. Enhanced <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> for angry faces was prevented by inducing affects of high motivational intensity. In both experiments, affective states led to a switch from specific enhancement of angry expressions in <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> to an equally sensitive representation of all emotional expressions. Our findings demonstrate that emotional expressions are of different behavioral relevance for the receiver depending on the affective context, supporting a functional organization of <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> along with flexible resource allocation. In <b>visual</b> working <b>memory,</b> stimulus processing adjusts to situational requirements and transitions from a specifically prioritizing default mode in predictable environments to a sensitive, hypervigilant mode in exposure to emotional events...|$|R
40|$|<b>Visual</b> {{short-term}} <b>memory</b> {{has been}} studied extensively, however nearly all research on this topic has assessed two-dimensional object properties. This is unexpected, given that most individuals perceive the visual environment in three-dimensions. In the experiments reported here, I investigate the stimuli necessary to assess <b>visual</b> short-term <b>memory</b> while eliminating potential confounds: the use of verbal <b>memory</b> to encode <b>visual</b> information, and the unintentional use of mental resources directed at irrelevant aspects of the memory task. I {{assess the impact of}} the amount of disparity, and the distribution of elements in depth, on <b>visual</b> short-term <b>memory.</b> Individuals retain simple visual stimuli equivalently when information is displayed in 2 -D or 3 -D, regardless of how objects are distributed in 3 -D. Conversely, ease of encoding does influence <b>visual</b> short-term <b>memory.</b> Tasks that facilitate encoding result in better <b>visual</b> short-term <b>memory</b> performance. The experiments reported show that stereoscopic 3 -D does not improve <b>visual</b> short-term <b>memory...</b>|$|R
5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable <b>visual</b> <b>memory,</b> and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with {{just the right amount of}} ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E
25|$|<b>Visual</b> <b>memory</b> {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} perceptual processing and the encoding, storage and retrieval of the resulting neural representations. <b>Visual</b> <b>memory</b> occurs over a broad time range spanning from eye movements to years in order to visually navigate to a previously visited location. <b>Visual</b> <b>memory</b> {{is a form of}} memory which preserves some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. We are able to place in memory visual information which resembles objects, places, animals or people in a mental image. The experience of <b>visual</b> <b>memory</b> is also referred to as the mind's eye through which we can retrieve from our memory a mental image of original objects, places, animals or people. <b>Visual</b> <b>memory</b> is one of several cognitive systems, which are all interconnected parts that combine to form the human memory. Types of palinopsia, the persistence or recurrence of a visual image after the stimulus has been removed, is a dysfunction of <b>visual</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
25|$|During encoding, {{participants}} are typically exposed to 1–10 visual patterns while {{connected to a}} brain imaging device. As the subject encodes the visual patterns researchers are able to directly view the activation of areas involved in <b>visual</b> <b>memory</b> encoding. During recall subjects again need to have all visual stimuli removed {{by means of a}} dark room or blindfolding to avoid interfering activation of other visual areas in the brain. Subjects are asked to recall each image clearly in their mind's eye. While recalling the images researchers are able view the areas activated by the <b>visual</b> <b>memory</b> task. Comparing the control 'baseline' state to the activated areas during the <b>visual</b> <b>memory</b> task allows researchers to view which areas are used during <b>visual</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
40|$|People often rely on {{information}} {{that is no longer}} in view, but maintained in <b>visual</b> short-term <b>memory</b> (VSTM). Traditionally, VSTM is thought to operate on either a short time-scale with high capacity - iconic memory - or a long time scale with small capacity - <b>visual</b> working <b>memory.</b> Recent research suggests that in addition, an intermediate stage of memory in between iconic <b>memory</b> and <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> exists. This intermediate stage has a large capacity and a lifetime of several seconds, but is easily overwritten by new stimulation. We therefore termed it fragile VSTM. In previous studies, fragile VSTM has been dissociated from iconic memory by the characteristics of the memory trace. In the present study, we dissociated fragile VSTM from <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> by showing a differentiation in their dependency on attention. A decrease in attention during presentation of the stimulus array greatly reduced the capacity of <b>visual</b> working <b>memory,</b> while this had only a small effect on the capacity of fragile VSTM. We conclude that fragile VSTM is a separate <b>memory</b> store from <b>visual</b> working <b>memory.</b> Thus, a tripartite division of VSTM appears to be in place, comprising iconic memory, fragile VSTM and <b>visual</b> working <b>memory...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} retain, and {{manipulate}} visual {{information in the}} mind {{is one of our}} most important human cognitive abilities. This ability varies widely across individuals yet why these large variations exist is poorly understood. In this thesis, I investigate the use of visual imagery as a cognitive strategy in <b>visual</b> working <b>memory,</b> and how this might produce these large individual differences. First, I carried out a correlational study where I found that participants with strong visual imagery (measured using binocular rivalry) tend to have larger <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> capacities. Next a new methodology using binocular rivalry was developed to measure the capacity limits of visual imagery. I found that the capacity limits of visual imagery are very similar to those found in the <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> literature. I then investigated the use of visual imagery as a mnemonic during <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> by employing a behavioural interference task (using background luminance) and neuro-stimulation (using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)), which have both been found to modulate visual imagery strength. In this thesis and previous studies, I have shown that luminance attenuates visual imagery strength. Similarly, in this thesis I found that decreasing visual cortex excitability (using tDCS) resulted in stronger visual imagery, while increasing cortical excitability lead to small decreases in strength. If imagery is used as a mnemonic during <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> these two types of visual imagery modulators, luminance and neuro-stimulation, should likewise alter <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> performance. I found that background luminance perturbed performance on a <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> task, but only for good and high capacity imagers. When tDCS was used to alter visual cortex excitability during a <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> task good imagers showed the greatest changes to their <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> performance. This collection of studies suggests that visual imagery is a cognitive strategy used by some participants to complete <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> tasks, and may help to explain, in part, the large individual differences found in <b>visual</b> working <b>memory.</b> The implications of these findings are then discussed in terms of theories of <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> and <b>visual</b> imagery...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Visual</b> working <b>memory</b> {{capacity}} is extremely limited {{and appears to}} be relatively immune to practice effects or the use of explicit strategies. The recent discovery that <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> tasks, like verbal working memory tasks, are subject to proactive interference, coupled with the fact that typical <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> tasks are particularly conducive to proactive interference, suggests that <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> capacity may be systematically under-estimated. Methodology/Principal Findings: Working memory capacity was probed behaviorally in adult humans both in laboratory settings and via the Internet. Several experiments show that although the effect of proactive interference on <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> is significant and can last over several trials, it only changes the capacity estimate by about 15 %. Conclusions/Significance: This study further confirms the sharp limitations on <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> capacity, both in absolute terms and relative to verbal working memory. It is suggested that future research take these limitations into account in understanding differences across a variety of tasks between human adults, prelinguistic infants and nonlinguistic animals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Many {{theories}} of attention {{have proposed that}} <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> {{plays an important role}} in visual search tasks. The present study examined the involvement of <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> in search using a dual-task paradigm in which participants performed a visual search task while maintaining no, two, or four objects in <b>visual</b> working <b>memory.</b> The presence of a working memory load added a constant delay to the visual search reaction times, irrespective of the number of items in the visual search array. That is, there was no change in the slope of the function relating reaction time to the number of items in the search array, indicating that the search process itself was not slowed by the memory load. Moreover, the search task did not substantially impair the maintenance of information in <b>visual</b> working <b>memory.</b> These results suggest that visual search requires minimal <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> resources, a conclusion that is inconsistent with theories that propose a close link between attention an...|$|R

25|$|One common {{group of}} people that have <b>visual</b> <b>memory</b> {{problems}} are children with reading disabilities. It was often thought that disabilities are caused by failure to perceive the letters of a written word in the right order. However, studies show {{it is more likely that}} it is caused by a failure to encode and process the correct order of letters within the word. This means that the child perceives the word just as anyone else would, however their brains do not appear to hold onto the visual characteristics of the word. Although initially it was found that children with reading disabilities had comparable <b>visual</b> <b>memory</b> to those without difficulty, a more specific part of the <b>visual</b> <b>memory</b> system has been found to cause reading disabilities.|$|E

40|$|Several {{authors have}} {{hypothesised}} that visuo-spatial working memory is functionally analogous to verbal working memory. Irrelevant background speech impairs verbal short-term memory. We investigated whether irrelevant visual information has an analogous effect on <b>visual</b> short-term <b>memory,</b> using a dynamic visual noise (DVN) technique known to disrupt visual imagery (Quinn & McConnell, 1996 a). Experiment 1 replicated {{the effect of}} DVN on pegword imagery. Experiments 2 and 3 showed no effect of DVN on recall of static matrix patterns, despite a significant effect of a concurrent spatial tapping task. Experiment 4 showed no effect of DVN on encoding or maintenance of arrays of matrix patterns, despite testing memory by a recognition procedure to encourage visual rather than spatial processing. Serial position curves showed a one-item recency effect typical of <b>visual</b> short-term <b>memory.</b> Experiment 5 showed no effect of DVN on short-term recognition of Chinese characters, despite effects of visual similarity and a concurrent colour memory task that confirmed visual processing of the characters. We conclude that irrelevant visual noise does not impair <b>visual</b> short-term <b>memory.</b> <b>Visual</b> working <b>memory</b> may not be functionally analogous to verbal working memory, and different cognitive processes may underlie <b>visual</b> short-term <b>memory</b> and <b>visual</b> imagery...|$|R
40|$|Visual search {{requires}} {{the maintenance of}} a search template in <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> in order to guide attention towards the target. This raises the question whether a search template is essentially the same as a <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> representation used in tasks that do not require attentional guidance, or whether it is a qualitatively different representation. Two experiments tested this by comparing electrophysiological markers of <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> maintenance between simple recognition and search tasks. For both experiments, responses were less rapid and less accurate in search task than in simple recognition. Nevertheless, the contralateral delay activity (CDA), an index of quantity and quality of <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> representations, was equal across tasks. On the other hand, the late positive complex (LPC), which is sensitive to the effort invested in <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> maintenance, was greater for the search task than the recognition task. Additionally, when the same target cue was repeated across trials (Experiment 2), the amplitude of <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> markers (both CDA and LPC) decreased, demonstrating learning of the target at an equal rate for both tasks. Our results suggest that a search template is qualitatively the same as a representation used for simple recognition, but greater effort is invested in its maintenance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that dynamic visual noise (DVN) does not interfere with memory for random matrices. This has led to suggestions that (a) <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> is distinct from imagery, and (b) <b>visual</b> working <b>memory</b> is not a gateway between sensory input and long-term storage. A comparison of the interference effects of DVN with memory for matrices and colored textures shows that DVN can interfere with <b>visual</b> working <b>memory,</b> probably at a level of visual detail not easily supported by long-term memory structures or the receding of the visual pattern elements.

25|$|The Benton Visual Retention Test is an {{assessment}} of visual perception, and <b>visual</b> <b>memory</b> abilities. More than 50 years of proven clinical use is the staple of the Benton Visual Retention Test. This test has proven its sensitivity to reading disabilities, nonverbal learning disabilities, traumatic brain injury, attention-deficit disorder, alzheimer's, {{and other forms of}} dementia. During testing participants are presented with 10 cards for 10 seconds with unique designs on each.
