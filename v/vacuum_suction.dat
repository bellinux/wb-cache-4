40|$|This {{study was}} made in order to {{determine}} how much the type of cotton affects the design parameters such as <b>vacuum</b> pressure, <b>suction</b> speed and break-off force in a simple cotton picking machinery. The <b>vacuum</b> pressure, <b>suction</b> speed and curl break-off forces belonging to the cotton types of DPXxC//BixLa hybrid and Nazilli 84 which is still being developed in accordance with the mechanical harvesting were measured. The statistical relationships between measured design parameters and cotton variety were searched. It was observed that there is no statistical difference between types in aspect of suction speed and values of vacuum pressure where as the types differ in aspect of lock break-off force. The lock break-off force of the type of Nazilli 84 was been found lower than the kind which is still being developed. Although the break-off forces of cotton variety are different it is observed that suction speed of 2 m s - 1 in average and a vacuum pressure of � 5 kPa is sufficient for the locks to be broken off from the bolls...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Taking {{a nozzle}} jet for gas-fluid phase flow as a {{research}} object, the influences of the main structural parameters on the vacuum in the internal suction volume are analyzed. Utilizing the software FLUENT to simulate the gas-liquid two-phase flow in nozzle jet with different structural parameters, the pressure distributions are obtained {{and the relationship between}} the structural parameters and the <b>vacuum</b> in the <b>suction</b> volume is concerned. The results show that the <b>vacuum</b> in the <b>suction</b> volume of jet reaches the maximum when these structural parameters are some certain values. The research is helpful for the optimal design and performance testing of nozzle jets...|$|R

50|$|The 800 series, {{introduced}} in 2013, {{is similar to}} the 700 series and its predecessors, but contains updated technology. The aeroforce performance cleaning system, which is five times more powerful than older series, and the iRobot XLife battery are some of the new features. The aeroforce system does away with the large rotating brush, but pulls air between two rubber rollers, thereby getting the <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> closer to the floor. In 2017 iRobot released the 890 with WiFi connectivity that can be started with an app and various personal-assistant software.|$|E
50|$|Argentine {{snake-necked turtles}} live in slow-moving ponds, rivers, streams, and marshes, preferably with aquatic vegetation. In coastal areas, they will enter {{brackish}} water, {{and they may}} hibernate in colder areas of their distribution. The turtles are carnivorous and eat snails, aquatic insects, fish, and amphibians. It attacks its prey {{with a combination of}} the Matamata's <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> and the stabbing neck motions of other snake-necked turtles. Courtship and mating has not been extensively observed in this species, although it is known that nesting occurs in the spring at the riverbanks. The eggs are 34x22 mm long, white, and brittle-shelled. Hatchlings are about 34 mm long, and have more wrinkled carapaces than adults.|$|E
50|$|Microdermabrasion is {{a fairly}} simple, easy, painless, non-invasive, skin {{rejuvenation}} procedure {{using a combination of}} a fine abrasive tip or crystals and <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> applied to the skin. Typically there are no needles or anesthetics required for microdermabrasion. The vacuum pressure and speed are adjusted depending on the sensitivity and tolerance of the skin. Microdermabrasion is often compared to the feeling of a cat licking the skin- a rough but gentle texture. Typical microdermabrasion sessions can last anywhere from 5-60 minutes. Minimal to no recovery time is required after microdermabrasion and most people immediately return to daily activity after a session. Makeup and non-irritating creams can usually be applied within a few hours or right after microdermabrasion. Since there is an often immediate increased minor skin sensitivity after microdermabrasion, irritating products like glycolic acids, Alpha Hydroxy Acids, Retinoid products or fragranced creams and lotions are typically avoided right after the procedure.|$|E
40|$|Filtration of {{seawater}} {{from the}} intertidal and coastal areas for separating chlorophyll pigments or {{particulate organic matter}} (POM) requires vacuum and for creating <b>vacuum,</b> a <b>suction</b> pump operated using AC/DC is essential. From the field or sea, large quantities of water samples have to be saved, brought to the laboratory and preserved by freezing until the filtration. Seawater filtration in remote areas with no power supply or portable suction pump is difficult but can be made possible by deploying a simple device involving filtering flask, a rubber hose and a safety pipette filler...|$|R

50|$|Just {{as with a}} {{standard}} motion picture camera, the intermittent register pin camera actually stops the film in the film gate while the photograph is being taken. In high-speed photography, this requires some modifications to the mechanism for achieving this intermittent motion at such high speeds. In all cases, a loop is formed {{before and after the}} gate to create and then take up the slack. Pulldown claws, which enter the film through perforations, pulling it into place and then retracting out of the perforations and out of the film gate, are multiplied to grab the film through multiple perforations in the film, thereby reducing the stress that any individual perforation is subjected to. Register pins, which secure the film through perforations in final position while it is being exposed, after the pulldown claws are retracted are also multiplied, and often made from exotic materials. In some cases, <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> is used to keep the film, especially 35 mm and 70 mm film, flat so that the images are in focus across the entire frame.|$|E
50|$|Hot water {{extraction}} equipment {{may be a}} portable unit that plugs into an electrical outlet, or a truck mount carpet cleaner requiring long hoses from the truck or trailer. Truck mounted equipment may be used where electricity is unavailable (e.g. if electrical service was terminated). Truck mount carpet cleaning may be unsuited to premises distant from a driveway or road, and hoses may need to pass through windows to reach upper floors of a building. Hoses needed for truck mount and professional portable carpet cleaning may present an inconvenience or tripping hazard to users of hallways, and pets or children can escape through doors that must be left ajar for hoses. Heated or air conditioned air will also escape from buildings when doors are left open for hoses, potentially creating a significant waste of energy. Truck mounted carpet cleaning equipment minimizes noise in the room being cleaned, but may cause noise and air pollution offensive to neighbors, and may violate anti-idling bylaws in some jurisdictions. However, truck-mounted cleaning is much faster than portable equipment, and the extra heat will dissolve more spots and stains, and more <b>vacuum</b> <b>suction</b> power will reduce drying times.|$|E
50|$|Most modern {{artificial}} limbs {{are attached}} to the stump of the amputee by belts and cuffs or by suction. The stump either directly fits into a socket on the prosthetic, or—more commonly today—a liner is used that then is fixed to the socket either by <b>vacuum</b> (<b>suction</b> sockets) or a pin lock. Liners are soft and by that, they can create a far better suction fit than hard sockets. Silicone liners can be obtained in standard sizes, mostly with a circular (round) cross section, but for any other stump shape, custom liners can be made. The socket is custom made to fit the residual limb and to distribute the forces of the artificial limb across the area of the stump (rather than just one small spot), which helps reduce wear on the stump. The custom socket is created by taking a plaster cast of the stump or, more commonly today, of the liner worn over the stump, and then making a mold from the plaster cast. Newer methods include laser guided measuring which can be input directly to a computer allowing for a more sophisticated design.|$|E
50|$|The manual {{vacuum cleaner}} was {{a type of}} non-electric <b>vacuum</b> cleaner, using <b>suction</b> to remove dirt from carpets, being powered by human muscle, similar in use to a manual lawn mower.

50|$|The {{flexible}} bulb has a plug {{that can}} be opened to pour off collected fluid. Each time fluid is removed, the patient, caregiver or healthcare provider squeezes {{the air out of}} the bulb and replaces the plug before releasing the bulb. The resulting <b>vacuum</b> creates <b>suction</b> in the drainage tubing, which gradually draws fluid from the surgical site into the bulb. The bulb may be repeatedly opened to remove the collected fluid and squeezed again to restore suction. It is best to empty drains before they are more than half full to avoid the discomfort of the weight of the drain pulling on the internal tubing.|$|R
