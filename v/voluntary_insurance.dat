25|$|As a back-up position, in 1965 Johnson {{turned his}} focus to {{hospital}} insurance {{for the aged}} under Social Security. The key player in initiating this program, named Medicare, was Wilbur Mills, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. In order to reduce Republican opposition, Mills suggested that Medicare be fashioned as a three layer cake—hospital insurance under Social Security, a <b>voluntary</b> <b>insurance</b> program for doctor visits and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor, known as Medicaid. The bill passed the house {{by a margin of}} 110 votes on April 8. The effort in the Senate was considerably more complicated; however, the Medicare bill passed Congress on July 28 after negotiation in a conference committee. Medicare now covers tens of millions of Americans. Johnson gave the first two Medicare cards to former President Harry S Truman and his wife Bess after signing the Medicare bill at the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri.|$|E

2500|$|It took {{taxation}} surpluses {{no longer}} needed by the wartime military and paying back in full Canada's debts accrued during the World Wars and the Great Depression. With remaining revenues, St-Laurent oversaw the expansion of Canada's social programs, including the gradual expansion of social welfare programs such as family allowances, old age pensions, government funding of university and post-secondary education and an early form of Medicare termed Hospital Insurance at the time. This scheme {{lay the groundwork for}} Tommy Douglas' healthcare system in Saskatchewan, and Pearson's nationwide universal healthcare in the late 1960s. Under this legislation, the federal government paid around 50% of the cost of provincial health plans to cover [...] "a basic range of inpatient services in acute, convalescent, and chronic hospital care." [...] The condition for the cost-sharing agreements was that all citizens were to be entitled to these benefits, and by March 1963, 98.8 of Canadians were covered by Hospital Insurance. According to historian Katherine Boothe, however, St. Laurent did not regard government health insurance to be a [...] "good policy idea", instead favouring the expansion of <b>voluntary</b> <b>insurance</b> through existing plans. In 1951, for instance, St. Laurent spoke in support of the medical profession assuming [...] "the administration and responsibility for, a scheme that would provide prepaid medical attendance to any Canadian who needed it".|$|E

40|$|Aim. To examine why {{the demand}} for substitutive <b>voluntary</b> health <b>insurance</b> in Germany is low. Method. Acomparison of the {{benefits}} andcosts of statutory andvoluntary health insurance in Germany, basedon a review of literature publishedin academic journals andbooks as well as gray literature. Results. Employees in Germany with gross earnings over 40, 500 a year can choose {{to opt out of}} the statutory health insurance scheme (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung, GKV) andpurchase substitutive <b>voluntary</b> health <b>insurance</b> instead. Only a quarter of these employees and their dependants actually choose to opt out; the majority remain in the GKV. Substitutive <b>voluntary</b> health <b>insurance</b> does not generally afford greater benefits than the GKV in terms of services provided or choice of insurer and only affords marginal benefits in terms of choice of provider. It is also more expensive than the GKV for people with dependants, elderly people and people in poor health. Consequently, the choice to opt out andpurchase substitutive <b>voluntary</b> health <b>insurance</b> {{is more likely to be}} taken by young, healthy or single people or couples with double incomes. Conclusion. Our analysis suggests that {{the demand for}} substitutive <b>voluntary</b> health <b>insurance</b> in Germany is low because the costs of opting out of the GKV are, in general, higher than the benefits afforded by purchasing substitutive <b>voluntary</b> health <b>insurance.</b> In the long term substitutive <b>voluntary</b> health <b>insurance</b> does not appear to provide good value for money when compared to the GKV, particularly for people with dependants, elderly people, and people in poor health...|$|R
60|$|But our {{proposals}} {{go farther}} than that. The State assistance to unemployment insurance {{will not be}} limited to those trades in which it is compulsory. Side by side with the compulsory system we shall offer facilities to <b>voluntary</b> <b>insurance</b> schemes in other trades, managed by trade unions or by societies or groups of workmen. Moreover, we contemplate that the State insurance office should undertake, if desired, the insurance against unemployment of any individual workman in any trade outside of those for which compulsory powers are required, and should afford to these individuals an equivalent support to that which is given in the trades which are subject to the compulsory system.|$|E
60|$|So I come to Unemployment Insurance. It is not {{practicable}} at {{the present}} time to establish a universal system of unemployment insurance. We, therefore, have to choose at the very outset of this subject between insuring some workmen in all trades or all workmen in some. In the first case we should have a voluntary, and in the second a compulsory system. The risk of unemployment varies so much between one man and another owing to relative skill, character, demeanour, and other qualities, that any system of State-aided <b>voluntary</b> <b>insurance</b> is utilised mainly by those most liable to be unemployed, and, consequently, a preponderance of bad risks is established against the Insurance Office fatal to its financial stability. On the other hand, a compulsory system of insurance, which did not add to the contribution of the worker a substantial contribution from outside, would almost certainly break down, because of the refusal of the higher class of worker to assume, unsupported, a share of the burden of the weaker members of the community.|$|E
60|$|History {{is full of}} {{forgotten}} controversies; {{and those}} who speak of Socialism now have nearly all forgotten that for some time it was an almost equal fight between Socialism and Anarchism for {{the leadership of the}} exodus from Capitalism. It is here that Herbert Spencer comes in logically, though not chronologically; also that much more interesting man, Auberon Herbert. Spencer has no special place as a man of letters; and a vastly exaggerated place as a philosopher. His real importance was that he was very nearly an Anarchist. The indefinable greatness there is about him after all, in spite of the silliest and smuggest limitations, is in a certain consistency and completeness from his own point of view. There is something mediæval, and therefore manful, about writing a book about everything in the world. Now this simplicity expressed itself in politics in carrying the Victorian worship of liberty to the most ridiculous lengths; almost to the length of voluntary taxes and <b>voluntary</b> <b>insurance</b> against murder. He tried, in short, {{to solve the problem of}} the State by eliminating the State from it. He was resisted in this by the powerful good sense of Huxley; but his books became sacred books for a rising generation of rather bewildered rebels, who thought we might perhaps get out of the mess if everybody did as he liked.|$|E

40|$|Adequate {{supervision}} (control) of {{the functioning}} of <b>voluntary</b> pension <b>insurance</b> {{is one of the}} preconditions for the development of this form of insurance.

50|$|A {{risk pool}} {{is one of}} the forms of risk {{management}} mostly practiced by insurance companies.

In particular, it is difficult to pool dissimilar risks in a <b>voluntary</b> <b>insurance</b> bracket, unless there is a subsidy available to encourage participation.|$|E
