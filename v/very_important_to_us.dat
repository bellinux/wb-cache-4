500|$|In December 2014, Jed Whedon {{explained}} {{the benefits of}} introducing a society of superhuman characters in the Inhumans, saying [...] "One of the things that, early on was <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> last season was, there were so {{few people in the}} Cinematic Universe who had powers. Really, only two humans had powers, Captain America and the Hulk. We had to be very responsible—we didn't want to dive into this show and have a new one every week, and have it feel like we disregarded everything that they spent so much money and time building in the films. Along those same lines, the origin of a power is always a complex thing—Marvel cares about it feeling grounded, it feeling scientific at some level. Even on Thor, he says, [...] "In our world, magic and science are the same thing." [...] So this is a way for us to sort of open up our world. It's a way to introduce, into the MCU, the idea that people can be born with a power. They don't have to be engineered in a lab, they don't need to have some freak accident with a vat of acid. They can be born with this. That's sort of a gamechanger, not just on our show, but in the cinematic universe".|$|E

Joe and Anthony Russo, the directors of Captain America: Civil War, had lobbied for months to include the character in the film. Anthony Russo stated that, despite Marvel telling them to have a [...] "plan B" [...] should the deal with Sony fail, the Russos never created one because [...] "it was <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> to reintroduce" [...] Spider-Man in the film, adding, [...] "We only have envisioned the movie with Spider-Man." [...] By the end of May 2015, Asa Butterfield, Tom Holland, Judah Lewis, Matthew Lintz, Charlie Plummer and Charlie Rowe screen tested for the lead role, against Robert Downey Jr., who portrays Iron Man, for chemistry. The six were chosen out of a search of over 1,500 actors to test in front of Feige, Pascal and the Russo brothers. In June, Feige and Pascal narrowed the actors considered to Holland and Rowe. Both screen tested again with Downey, with Holland also testing with Chris Evans, who portrays Captain America, and emerged as the favorite. On June 23, 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios jointly announced that Holland would play Spider-Man. The following month, Marisa Tomei was in talks for the role of May Parker, later appearing in Civil War.|$|E

They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background. At the time, Marvel did not confirm his involvement in Civil War, due to being contractually obligated not to talk about his inclusion publicly. The Russos discussed this, saying that the various business deals and agreements stemming from the sharing of the character rights, such as on a promotional and commercial level, [...] "were always lagging slightly behind how we were using the character. We were always in danger of upsetting the deal—there were still sensitive issues going on between the two studios that they needed to agree on." [...] Holland was confirmed to appear in the film in July 2015, by Jonathan M. Goldstein, one of the writers of the solo Spider-Man film, and later by Entertainment Weekly from a set visit. Jon Watts, director of Spider-Man: Homecoming, was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes, in order to [...] "see what they were doing with it, and that informed where we eventually took it," [...] and provide [...] "ideas about this and that", such as what Parker's wardrobe and bedroom should look like, [...] "to make sure we were all on the same page so that [...] transitions seamlessly with theirs."

6000|$|In {{all this}} {{we see that}} guide-books are <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> {{and that there is}} little or no fault to be found with them, since even the worst give some {{guidance}} and enable us in after times mentally to revisit distant places. It may then be said that there are really no bad guide-books, and that those that are good in the highest sense are beyond praise. A reverential sentiment, which is almost religious in character, connects itself in our minds with the very name of Murray. It is, however, possible to make an injudicious use of these books, and by so doing to miss the fine point of many a pleasure. The very fact that these books are guides to us and invaluable, and that we readily acquire the habit of taking them about with us and consulting them at frequent intervals, comes between us and that rarest and most exquisite enjoyment to be experienced amidst novel scenes. He that visits a place new to him for some special object rightly informs himself of all that the book can tell him. The knowledge may be useful; pleasure is with him a secondary object. But if pleasure be the main object, it will only be experienced in the highest degree by him who goes without book and discovers what old Fuller called the [...] "observables" [...] for himself. There will be no mental pictures previously formed; consequently what is found will not disappoint. When the mind has been permitted to dwell beforehand on any scene, then, however beautiful or grand it may be, the element of surprise is wanting and admiration is weak.
