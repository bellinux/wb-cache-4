50|$|<b>Variable</b> <b>Compression</b> <b>Ratio</b> (VCR) is {{becoming}} increasingly desirable as oil prices increase and car buyers have an increased interest in fuel economy. In addition, Global Climate Warming requires measures from the international community. To the Automobile industry, it means stricter limits to car emissions, especially CO2. <b>Variable</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> is one cost effective way of achieving these targets. In addition, VCR allows free use of different fuels besides petrol e.g. LPG or ethanol.|$|E

5000|$|Model diesels have <b>variable</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ratios.</b> This <b>variable</b> <b>compression</b> is {{achieved}} by a [...] "contra-piston," [...] {{at the top of}} the cylinder, which can be adjusted by a screwed [...] "T-bar". The swept volume of the engine remains the same, but as the volume of the combustion chamber at top dead center is changed by adjusting the contra-piston, the <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> (swept volume + combustion chamber / combustion chamber) changes accordingly.There also exist model diesels with fixed compression heads. A few examples are the British 5cc OWAT or the American DRONE.These engines have a fixed <b>compression</b> <b>ratio,</b> but the <b>compression</b> can be altered slightly with the use of more or less lubrication oil in the fuel.Also the engine's load affects the compression and ignition timing.Larger propellers give a longer combustion time and so higher compression.Smaller propellers reduce the load, and therefore the compression pressure build up, which changes the ignition timing to earlier.|$|R
5000|$|The {{operational}} flexibility through the <b>variable</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> allows operation optimisation for all operating conditions and multi-fuel operation. The free-piston engine is further {{well suited for}} homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) operation.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of octane rating {{worldwide}} is the Research Octane Number (RON). RON is determined by running the fuel in a test engine with a <b>variable</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> under controlled conditions, and comparing the results with those for mixtures of iso-octane and n-heptane.|$|E
50|$|The FPLG {{has many}} {{potential}} advantages compared to traditional electric generator powered by an internal combustion engine. One {{of the main}} advantages of the FPLG comes from the absence of crankshaft. It leads to a smaller and lighter engine with fewer parts. This also allows a <b>variable</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ratio,</b> which {{makes it possible to}} design an engine that works ideally with different kinds of fuel.|$|E
40|$|Controlled {{auto-ignition}} (CAI) combustion, {{also known}} as Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) was achieved in a four-stroke gasoline engine, by internally recycling burned gases through positive valve overlap in combination with <b>variable</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ratios</b> and intake temperature control. The operational range of CAI combustion was determined {{for a range of}} <b>compression</b> <b>ratios</b> and intake air temperatures at wide open throttle conditions. This was followed by further engine experiments with boosted intake and external EGR in order to evaluate their effect on the operational range of CAI combustion and the engine’s performance and emissions. It has been found that the CAI operational region could be extended to the higher load region by boosting and running with leaner mixtures, whilst the use of external EGR allowed the engine to operate CAI combustion optimized in the region between naturally aspirated and lean boosted CAI operational regions...|$|R
40|$|Controlled Auto-Ignition (CAI) {{combustion}} {{was investigated}} in a Ricardo E 6 single cylinder, four-stroke gasoline engine. CAI combustion was achieved by employing positive valve overlap in combination with <b>variable</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ratios</b> and intake air temperatures. The combustion characteristics and emissions were studied {{in order to understand}} the major advantages and drawbacks of CAI combustion with positive valve overlap. The enlargement of the CAI operational region was obtained by boosting intake air and adding external EGR. The lean-boosted operation elevated the range of CAI combustion to the higher load region, whilst the use of external EGR allowed the engine to operate with CAI combustion in the region between boosted and N/A CAI operational ranges. The results were analyzed to investigate combustion characteristics, performance and emissions of the boosted CAI operations. ...|$|R
5000|$|Full-size diesel engines, such {{as those}} found in a truck, are fuel {{injected}} and either two-stroke or four-stroke. They use compression ignition to ignite the mixture: the compression within the cylinder heats the inlet charge sufficiently to cause ignition, without requiring an applied ignition source. A fundamental feature of such engines, unlike petrol (gasoline) engines, is that they draw in air alone and the fuel is only mixed by being injected into the combustion chamber separately. Model diesel engines are instead a carbureted two-stroke using the crankcase for compression. The carburetor supplies a mixture of fuel and air into the engine, with the proportions kept fairly constant and their total volume throttled to control the engine power. Apart from sharing the diesel's use of compression ignition, their construction has {{more in common with}} a small two-stroke motorcycle or lawnmower engine. In addition to this, model diesels have <b>variable</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ratios.</b> This <b>variable</b> <b>compression</b> is achieved by a [...] "contra-piston," [...] {{at the top of the}} cylinder, which can be adjusted by a screwed [...] "T-bar". The swept volume of the engine remains the same, but as the volume of the combustion chamber at top dead centre is changed by adjusting the contra-piston, the <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> (swept volume + combustion chamber / combustion chamber) changes accordingly.|$|R
5000|$|In 1911 the Macomber Rotary Engine Company of Los Angeles marketed one of {{the first}} axial internal-combustion engines, {{manufactured}} by the Avis Engine Company of Allston, Massachusetts. A four-stroke, air-cooled unit, it had seven cylinders and a <b>variable</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ratio,</b> altered by changing the wobble-plate angle and hence the length of piston stroke. It was called a [...] "rotary engine", because the entire engine rotated apart from the end casings.|$|E
50|$|In low-demand {{conditions}} (low {{to medium}} engine speeds), the engine uses HCCI. In high-demand conditions, it operates {{like a regular}} gasoline engine (using spark ignition of the fuel/air mixture) and uses the full benefits of direct fuel injection, turbocharging and variable valve timing to maximize efficiency. These two modes of operation require different compression ratios, achieved via a concept {{similar to that of}} the Lanchester shaft, which is why the engine also features a <b>variable</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Variable</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> is a {{technology}} {{to adjust the}} compression ratio of an internal combustion engine while the engine is in operation. This is done to increase fuel efficiency while under varying loads. Higher loads require lower ratios to be more efficient and vice versa. Variable compression engines allow for the volume above the piston at 'Top dead centre' to be changed. For automotive use {{this needs to be}} done dynamically in response to the load and driving demands.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the performance of}} biodiesel blends in a single-cylinder water-cooled diesel engine. All experiments were carried out at constant speed 1500 [*]rpm and the biodiesel blends were varied from B 10 to B 100. The engine was equipped with <b>variable</b> <b>compressions</b> <b>ratio</b> (VCR) mechanism. For 100 % Jatropha biodiesel, the maximum fuel consumption was 15 % {{higher than that of}} diesel fuel. The brake thermal efficiency for biodiesel and its blends was found to be slightly higher than that of diesel at various load conditions. The increase in specific fuel consumption ranged from 2. 75 % to 15 % for B 10 to B 100 fuels. The exhaust gas temperature increased with increased biodiesel blend. The highest exhaust gas temperature observed was 430 °C with biodiesel for load conditions 1. 5 [*]kW, 2. 5 [*]kW, and 3. 5 [*]kW, where as for diesel the maximum exhaust gas temperature was 440 °C. The CO 2 emission from the biodiesel fuelled engine was higher by 25 % than diesel fuel at full load. The CO emissions were lower with Jatropha by 15 %, 13 %, and 13 % at 1. 5 [*]kW, 2. 5 [*]kW, and 3. 5 [*]kW load conditions, respectively.

50|$|The {{operational}} characteristics of free-piston engines {{differ from those}} of conventional, crankshaft engines. The main difference is due to the piston motion not being restricted by a crankshaft in the free-piston engine, leading to the potentially valuable feature of <b>variable</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ratio.</b> This does, however, also present a control challenge, since the position of the dead centres must be accurately controlled in order to ensure fuel ignition and efficient combustion, and to avoid excessive in-cylinder pressures or, worse, the piston hitting the cylinder head.|$|E

5000|$|The {{overview}} given above may {{describe a}} modern {{version of the}} Miller cycle, but it differs in some respects from the 1957 patent. The patent describes [...] "a new and improved method of operating a supercharged intercooled engine". The engine may be two-cycle or four-cycle and the fuel may be diesel, dual fuel, or gas. It {{is clear from the}} context that [...] "gas" [...] means gaseous fuel and not gasoline. The pressure-charger shown in the diagrams is a turbocharger, not a positive-displacement supercharger. The engine (whether four-stroke or two-stroke) has a conventional valve or port layout, but an additional [...] "compression control valve" [...] (CCV) is in the cylinder head. The servo mechanism, operated by inlet manifold pressure, controls the lift of the CCV during part of the compression stroke and releases air from the cylinder to the exhaust manifold. The CCV would have maximum lift at full load and minimum lift at no load. The effect is to produce an engine with a <b>variable</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ratio.</b> As inlet manifold pressure goes up (because of the action of the turbocharger) the effective compression ratio in the cylinder goes down (because of the increased lift of the CCV) and vice versa. This [...] "will insure proper starting and ignition of the fuel at light loads".|$|E

40|$|The SAAB <b>variable</b> <b>compression</b> {{engine is}} a new engine concept that enables the fuel {{consumption}} to be radically cut by varying the <b>compression</b> <b>ratio.</b> A challenge with this new engine concept is that the <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> has a direct influence on the output torque, which means that a change in <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> also leads {{to a change in}} the torque. A torque change may be felt as a jerk in the movement of the car, and this is an undesirable effect since the driver has no control over the <b>compression</b> <b>ratio.</b> The aim of this master's thesis work is to develop a torque control strategy for the SAAB <b>variable</b> <b>compression</b> engine. Where the main control objective is to make the output torque behave in a desirable way despite the influence of <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> changes. The controller is developed using a design method called Internal Model Control, which is a straightforward way of both configuring a controller and determining its parameters.

40|$|<b>Variable</b> <b>compression</b> {{engines are}} a mean {{to meet the}} demand on lower fuel consumption. A high <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> results in high engine efficiency, but also {{increases}} the knock tendency. On conventional engines with fixed <b>compression</b> <b>ratio,</b> knock is avoided by retarding the ignition angle. The <b>variable</b> <b>compression</b> engine offers an extra dimension in knock control, since both ignition angle and <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> can be adjusted. The central question is thus for what combination of <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> and ignition angle the maximum efficiency is achieved, considering the set of <b>compression</b> <b>ratios</b> and ignition angles that give a sufficiently low knock intensity. Four knock detection methods are proposed, compared and evaluated with respect to robustness for noise and choices of parameter values. Three of the knock detectors are categorised as on-line, and are designed for giving feedback about knock occurrence to the engine control unit. The methods can determine both whether or not knock is present and the crank angle at knock onset. A study of the relationship between knock oscillation properties and knock-onset is performed. It is concluded that the logarithm of the normalised knock energy depends almost linearly on the rate of knock occurrence. A new formulation of multi-zone engine models is presented. The formulation makes it easy to increase or decrease the number of zones during the simulation. One of many possible applications is the investigation of engine efficiency. An analysis of experimental data shows how the engine efficiency changes with <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> and ignition angle.
