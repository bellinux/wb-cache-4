For fixed t, {{the distribution of the}} risk process is investigated. By using the theory of the canonical measure, we show that the risk process is asymptotically α-stably distributed when the net profit of a policy belongs to the domain of attraction of an α-stable distribution with index α(0 <α≤ 2). Finally, we consider a special case in which each policy is restricted to being claimed at most once and obtain the weak convergence results under two very explicit moment conditions: heavy-tailed distribution and finite second moment of claims...|$|E

Results show that the 16 facets constituted homogeneous item clusters (i. e., unidimensional and internally consistent parcels) that fit well into 5 clinically interpretable, higher order domains: self-control, identity integration, relational capacities, social concordance, and responsibility. These domains appeared to have good concurrent validity across various populations, good convergent <b>validity</b> in <b>terms</b> of associations with interview ratings of the severity of personality pathology, and good discriminant <b>validity</b> in <b>terms</b> of associations with trait-based personality disorder dimensions. Furthermore, results suggest that the domain scores are stable over a time interval of 14 - 21 days in a student sample but are sensitive to change over a 2 -year follow-up interval in a treated patient population. Taken together, the final instrument, the SIPP- 118, provides a set of 5 reliable, valid, and efficient indices of the core components of (mal) adaptive personality functioning...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to develop a measure that assesses {{negative}} daily social encounters. Specifically, we examined the concept of perceived chronic social adversity and its assessment, the Perceived Chronic Social Adversity Questionnaire (PCSAQ). The PCSAQ focused on the subjective processing of daily social experiences. Psychometric properties were examined within two non-clinical samples (N = 331 and N = 390) and one clinical sample (N = 86). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a three-factor model of the PCSAQ, which corresponds to three types of daily social stressors. The final 28 -item PCSAQ was shown to be internally consistent, and to have good construct <b>validity</b> in <b>terms</b> of factor structure and group differences. It was also shown to have good concurrent <b>validity</b> in <b>terms</b> of association with outcome variables (sense of control, happiness, and mood and anxiety symptoms). Perceived chronic social adversity was also shown to be correlated with PTSD severity. Taken together, these findings suggest that the PCSAQ is a reliable, valid, and useful measure that can be used to assess negative social and clinical aspects of personal experiences. This study is an important exploratory step in improving our understanding of the relationship between the cumulative effect of negative social encounters and psychological difficulty...|$|R

Purpose: To evaluate intrarater and interrater reliability of newly proposed TLICS schemes and to estimate validity of TLICS’s final treatment recommendation. Overview of Literature: Despite numerous literature about thoracolumbar spine injury classifications, {{there is no}} consensus regarding the optimal system. Methods: Using plain radiographs, computed tomography scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, and medical records, 3 clssifiers, consisting of 2 spine surgeons and 1 senior orthopaedic surgery resident, reviewed 114 clinical thoracolumbar spine injury cases retrospectively to classify and calculate injury severity score according to TLICS. This process were repeated on 4 weeks intervals and the scores were then compared with type of treatment that patient ultimately received. Results: The intrarater reliability of TLICS was substantial agreement on total score and injury morphology, almost perfect agreement on integrity of the posterior ligament complex (PLC) and neurologic status. The interrater reliability was substantial agreement on injury morphology and integrity of the PLC, moderate agreement on total score, almost perfect agreement on neurologic status. The TLICS schems exhibited satisfactory overall <b>validity</b> in <b>terms</b> of clinical decision making. Conclusions: The TLICS was demonstrated acceptable intrarater and interrater reliability and satisfactory <b>validity</b> in <b>terms</b> of treatment recommendation...|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} human {{functioning}} and school organisation informed by Basil Bernstein’s {{sociology of education}} suggests that to gain the commitment and promote the health of students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, schools require radical transformations eroding various ‘boundaries’: between and among staff and students; between students’ academic learning and broader social development and welfare; and between schools and their local communities. Existing research examining this theory has reported associations between school-level proxy measures of student commitment and lower rates of student smoking, drinking alcohol, use of drugs and violence. But this research has not directly assessed whether reduced school boundaries explain this. We piloted a new scale derived from teacher reports to measure unhealthy school boundaries and examined its inter-item reliability and its criterion <b>validity</b> in <b>terms</b> of associations with various measures of school commitment and smoking. Data on boundaries came from 101 teachers across 40 schools. Data on student commitment and smoking came from 6667 students. We assessed reliability by examining correlations between scale-items and criterion <b>validity</b> in <b>terms</b> of associations with student-reported commitment and smoking. Inter-item reliability was sub-optimal but better within the subscales about boundaries between academic/broader learning and schools/local communities. The scale had good criterion validity, strongly associated with reduced student-reported school commitment and increased student-reported smoking. We reflect on {{the implications of these}} findings in terms of critical perspectives on health promotion in schools and the strengths and limitations of quantitative research in examining health behaviours as opposed to practices...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} "washback, " {{especially}} {{prominent in the}} field of applied linguistics, refers {{to the extent to which}} a test influences teachers and learners to do things they would not otherwise necessarily do. Some writers invoke the notion of washback validity, holding that a test's validity should be gauged by the degree to which it has a positive influence on teaching. The complexity and uncontrolled variables of washback make it unsuitable for establishing test validity, but one can turn to the test properties likely to produce washback [...] authenticity and directness [...] and explore what they might mean in <b>validity</b> <b>terms.</b> The terms "authentic " and "direct " are most often used in connection with assessments involving realistic simulations or criterion samples. Purportedly authentic and direct performance assessments may not yield positive washback because the ideal forms of authenticity and directness rarely, if ever, exist. Construct underrepresentation and construct-irrelevant variance are present to varying degrees. To facilitate positive washback, an assessment must strive to avoid these two pitfalls. A comprehensive exploration of construct validity and its six distinguishable aspects (content, substantive, structural, generalizability, external, and consequential aspects) demonstrates that validity can be seen as a unified concept with the unifying force being the meaningfulness or interpretability of the test scores and action implications. The principles of unified validity provide a framework for evaluating all educational and psychological measurement, including washback. (Contains 29 references.) (SLD...|$|R
