40|$|Due to {{the large}} surface-to-volume ratio, surface <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> play a {{dominant}} role in the optoelectronic properties of nanoscale devices(1 - 6). Understanding the surface <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> allows us to properly engineer the device surfaces for better performance. But characterization of surface <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> at nanoscale has been a formidable challenge using the traditional capacitive techniques based on metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structures(7) and deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) (8 - 11). Here, we demonstrate a simple but powerful optoelectronic method to probe the density of nanowire surface <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> to the limit of a single <b>trap</b> <b>state.</b> Unlike traditional capacitive techniques (Fig 1 a), in this method we choose to tune the quasi-Fermi level across the bandgap of a silicon nanowire photoconductor, allowing for capture and emission of photogenerated charge carriers by surface <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> (Fig 1 b). The experimental data show that the energy density of nanowire surface <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> is in a range from 10 ^ 9 cm^- 2 /eV at deep levels to 10 ^ 12 cm^- 2 /eV {{in the middle of}} the upper half bandgap. This optoelectronic method allows us to conveniently probe <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> of ultra-scaled nano/quantum devices at extremely high precision. Comment: 9 pages and 3 figure...|$|R

30|$|To {{elaborate}} temperature {{effect on}} PL intensity of quantized <b>states</b> and <b>trap</b> <b>states,</b> we compare PL intensity of quantized states {{with that of}} <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> for CdSe on the quartz coverslip and silver films, respectively. The integrated PL intensity ratio of quantized <b>states</b> and <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> run up to 7.1 and 23 for CdSe QDs on the quartz coverslip surface and silver films at lower temperature (4  K) as shown in Fig.  4 c, respectively. From the ratio of PL intensities of quantized <b>states</b> and <b>trap</b> <b>states,</b> {{it can be concluded}} that the silver films further enhance the energy transfer (ET) process from the quantized <b>states</b> to <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> due to the surface plasmonic coupling effect. To elucidate the temperature effect on energy transfer process from quantized states to surface states, the energy transfer model consisting of core quantized state, surface state, and ground state was established [34].|$|R
30|$|The {{different}} PL decay {{curves of}} the quantized <b>states</b> emission and <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> emission can be fitted {{as shown in}} Fig.  5 c, d. As {{can be seen from}} the two figures, the nonradiative decay rate becomes larger at 200  K and thus, the PL decay of quantized states is faster. However, the corresponding PL decay of <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> becomes slower at lower temperature. As mentioned above, the conventional three-state model can perfectly explain the temperature effect on PL dynamic process between quantized <b>states</b> and surface <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> [38, 39]. Therefore, the temperature-dependent PL intensity of quantized <b>states</b> and surface <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> as shown in Fig.  4 a, b suggests the energy transfer that occurs through thermally activated process.|$|R
30|$|D. Kim et al. [30 – 33] have {{systematically}} {{reported the}} temperature effect on photoluminescence (PL) {{dynamics of the}} CdSe QDs, and the experimental result demonstrates that the bound-exciton state causes {{a significant impact on}} radiative decay lifetime. Temperature dependence of thermal population behavior is an important factor for the ET process from quantized states to surface states. However, researches paid little attention to the temperature-dependent dynamics of <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> and ET process between quantized <b>states</b> and <b>trap</b> <b>states.</b> The photoluminescence (PL) mechanism of <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> is being highly debated. Therefore, in order to better understand the photoluminescence (PL) origin of surface <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> in the CdSe QDs, it is important to explore temperature effect on photoluminescence (PL) decay and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of quantized <b>states</b> and surface <b>trap</b> <b>states,</b> respectively. Here, we investigate temperature and wavelength dependence of photoluminescence (PL) properties of surface states and ET process from low temperature to room temperature in this paper.|$|R
30|$|Finally, we {{confirm that}} by using these visualizations, <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> for {{learners}} could be detected and they changed for each trial. This means that <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> {{in the previous}} trial did not remain <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> in the next trial. Moreover, the number of learners and actions decreased from one trial to the next. This indicates {{that the number of}} learners who had a good understanding of the problem structure increased, although there were small numbers of learners who were still confused.|$|R
40|$|Quantum dots (QDs) are {{semiconductor}} nanocrystals {{having a}} size comparable to or smaller than its exciton Bohr radius. The {{small size of}} QDs leads to the quantum confinement effects in their electronic structures. Their unique optical properties, including a tunable emission from UV to IR, make QDs attractive in optoelectronic applications. However, further improvements in device performance are required to make them competitive. One well-known factor that presently limits the performance of QD thin film devices is sub-band-gap states, {{also referred to as}} <b>trap</b> <b>states.</b> For instance, <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> impair optical properties and device performance by providing alternative pathways for exciton quenching and carrier recombination. Chemical modification of QDs has been commonly used for passivating <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> and thereby improving QD devices. However, the influence of chemical modifications of ligands, QD surfaces, or synthetic routes on electrical properties of QD thin films is not sufficiently characterized. Suppressing the <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> in QD thin films is a key to improve the performance of QDbased optoelectronics. This requires fundamental understanding of <b>trap</b> <b>state</b> source, which is lacking in these materials. In this thesis, I pursue to find a systematic method to control density of <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> by exploring different characterization techniques to investigate <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> in QD thin films. These attempts provide insight to develop a rationale for fabricating better performing QD devices. This thesis focuses on the <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> in IR emitting lead sulfide (PbS) QD thin films, which have great potential for application in photovoltaics, light emitting diodes (LEDs), photodetectors, and bio-imaging. Previously, QD thin films are treated with different ligands to passivate <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> and thereby improve the device performance. Through my work, I pursued to unveil the electrical characteristics and chemical origin of <b>trap</b> <b>states,</b> and develop a strategy to suppress the <b>trap</b> <b>states.</b> First, I hypothesize that surface dangling bonds are a major source of <b>trap</b> <b>states.</b> An inorganic shell layer comprised of cadmium sulfide (CdS) is introduced to PbS QDs to passivate the surface states. Addition of CdS shell layers on PbS QDs yields an enhanced stability and quantum yield (QY), which indicates decreased trap-assisted exciton quenching. These PbS/CdS core/shell QDs have a potential for deep-tissue bio-imaging in shortwavelength IR windows of 1550 - 1900 nm. However, the shell layer acts as a transport barrier for carriers and results in a significant decrease in conductivity. This hinders the incorporation of the core/shell QDs in electrical applications. An improved reaction condition enables the synthesis of PbS/CdS QDs having a monolayer-thick CdS shell layer. These QDs exhibit QY and stability comparable to thick-shell PbS/CdS QDs. Incorporation of these thin-shell QDs improves external quantum efficiency of IR QD-LEDs by 80 times compared to PbS core-only QDs. In the second phase of my work, I explore capacitance-based measurement techniques for better understanding of the electrical properties of PbS QD thin films. For in-depth analysis, capacitance-based techniques are introduced, which give complementary information to current-based measurements that are widely used for the characterization of QD devices. Nyquist plots are used to determine the dielectric constant of QD films and impedance analyzing models to be used for further analysis. Mott-Schottky measurements are implemented to measure carrier concentration and mobility to compare PbS core-only and PbS/CdS core/shell QD thin films. Drive-level capacitance profiling is employed to characterize the density and energy level of <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> when QD films are oxidized. Lastly, I investigate the chemical origin of <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> and use this knowledge to suppress the <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> of PbS QD thin films. Photoluminescence spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that standard ligand exchange procedures for device fabrication lead to the formation of sub-bandgap emission features and under-charged Pb atoms. Our experimental results are corroborated by density functional theory simulation, which shows that the presence of Pb atoms with a lower charge in QDs contributes to sub-bandgap <b>states.</b> The <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> generated after ligand exchange were significantly reduced by oxidation of under-charged Pb atoms using 1, 4 -benzoquinone. The density of <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> measured electrically with drive-level capacitance profiling shows that this reduces the electrical trap density by a factor of 40. In this thesis, I characterized <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> and showed that by suppressing the <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> we can modify the electrical properties of QD thin films, which influence the performance of QD devices directly. This work is a starting point to fully analyze the <b>trap</b> <b>states</b> in QD thin devices and thereby provides insight to design a rationale for fabricating better performing QD devices. by Gyuweon Hwang.

40|$|A quasi 2 -D {{conduction}} model {{based on}} the thermionic emission of charge carriers over the energy barriers at discrete grain boundaries is formulated for a polycrystalline silicon thin-film transistor with an undoped body.

In the description of collective two-atom effects we allow the mean number of pump atoms inside the cavity during the characteristic atomic cavity transit time to be as large as of order one. The master equation we consider, which describes the micromaser including collective two-atom effects, still exhibits <b>trapping</b> <b>states</b> for even for a mean number of atoms inside the cavity close to one.

30|$|The above {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} bipolar resistance switching with eightwise polarity originates from {{the presence of the}} Schottky barrier near the Au/STO interface, in which there exist <b>trapping</b> <b>states,</b> such as oxygen vacancies and impurity states. The Schottky barrier width/height is changed due to the trapping/detrapping effect in the depletion layer [10, 14]. When a large forward-bias voltage is applied to the Schottky junction, electrons are discharged from the <b>trapping</b> <b>states,</b> resulting in unoccupied <b>trapping</b> <b>states</b> in the Schottky barrier. The increased density of positively charged <b>trapping</b> <b>states</b> in the depletion layer reduces the Schottky width/height, which results in the large leakage current simultaneously. So the Au/STO/Ti cell is switched to the LRS. In the lower-bias-voltage region, electrons can tunnel easily through the reduced Schottky barrier. When a large reverse-bias voltage is applied, electrons are captured in the <b>trapping</b> <b>states,</b> resulting in the reduction of the net positive charge in the depletion layer. This makes the barrier wider and higher, and the cell returns to the HRS. The trapped electrons seem to be released during a coming positive bias sweeping. The electroforming process is not required to realize this eightwise-polarity switching. This is because the high concentration of defects exists in the pristine junction due to the STO films prepared in an anoxic environment.|$|R

No nonradiative energy transfer from surface <b>trapping</b> <b>state</b> to gold nanofilm, thus the lifetime of surface <b>trapping</b> <b>state</b> was not affected obviously.
