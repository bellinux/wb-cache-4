5|$|There {{are ongoing}} {{programs}} {{working on a}} dengue <b>vaccine</b> <b>to</b> cover all four serotypes. Now {{that there is a}} fifth serotype this will need to be factored in. One of the concerns is that a vaccine could increase the risk of severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The ideal vaccine is safe, effective after one or two injections, covers all serotypes, does not contribute to ADE, is easily transported and stored, and is both affordable and cost-effective.|$|E

5|$|All known prion diseases, collectively called {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are untreatable and fatal. However, {{a vaccine}} developed in mice may provide insight into providing a <b>vaccine</b> <b>to</b> resist prion infections in humans. Additionally, in 2006 scientists announced that they had genetically engineered cattle lacking a necessary gene for prion production– thus theoretically making them immune to BSE, building on research indicating that mice lacking normally occurring prion protein are resistant to infection by scrapie prion protein. In 2013, a study revealed that 1 in 2,000 people in the United Kingdom might harbour the infectious prion protein that causes vCJD.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, Maurice Brodie, a {{research}} assistant at New York University, attempted to produce a formaldehyde-killed polio vaccine from ground-up monkey spinal cords. His initial attempts were hampered by the difficulty of obtaining enough virus. Brodie first tested the vaccine on himself {{and several of his}} assistants. He then gave the <b>vaccine</b> <b>to</b> three thousand children. Many of these children developed allergic reactions, but none developed immunity to polio. Philadelphia pathologist John Kolmer also claimed to have developed a vaccine that same year, but it too produced no immunity and was blamed for causing cases of paralytic polio, nine of them fatal.|$|E
5|$|The BCG vaccine has limitations, and {{research}} {{to develop new}} TB vaccines is ongoing. A number of potential candidates are currently in phase I and II clinical trials. Two main approaches {{are being used to}} attempt to improve the efficacy of available vaccines. One approach involves adding a subunit <b>vaccine</b> <b>to</b> BCG, while the other strategy is attempting to create new and better live vaccines. MVA85A, an example of a subunit vaccine, currently in trials in South Africa, is based on a genetically modified vaccinia virus. Vaccines are hoped to {{play a significant role in}} treatment of both latent and active disease.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability to}} rapidly {{reproduce}} HeLa cells {{in a laboratory}} setting has led to many important breakthroughs in biomedical research. For example, by 1954, Jonas Salk was using HeLa cells in his research to develop the polio <b>vaccine.</b> <b>To</b> test his new vaccine, the cells were mass-produced in the first-ever cell production factory. Additionally, Chester M. Southam, a leading virologist, injected HeLa cells into cancer patients, prison inmates, and healthy individuals in order to observe if cancer could be transmitted {{as well as to}} examine if one could become immune to cancer by developing an acquired immune response.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{opened on}} June 11, 2007 in Washington, DC. The Cedillos' six expert {{witnesses}} argued that thimerosal-containing vaccines degraded Michelle's immune system, {{which in turn}} {{made it possible for}} the weakened measles virus in the MMR <b>vaccine</b> <b>to</b> cause a persistent infection leading to autism. In support of this hypothesis, the Cedillos' witnesses relied on the reported detection of measles virus in Michelle's gastrointestinal tract by John O'Leary's Unigenetics laboratory in Dublin. However, the government's expert witnesses conclusively demonstrated that O'Leary's positive results were caused by contamination in the Unigenetics lab rather than an actual infection.|$|E

He breaks Scully's confinement and uses the <b>vaccine</b> <b>to</b> revive her, but this disrupts the facility and cocooned aliens begin trying to escape. Just after the agents escape to the surface, a huge alien vessel emerges from beneath the ice and travels into the sky. Mulder watches it disappear into the distance as Scully regains consciousness. Some time later, Scully attends a hearing, where her testimony is disregarded and the evidence covered up. She hands over the only remaining proof of their ordeal, the bee that stung her, noting that the FBI is not currently capable of investigating this evidence. Outside, Mulder reads an article that has covered up the domes and crop field in Texas; Scully informs Mulder that she is willing to continue working with him.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} procedure used {{to prevent}} smallpox was inoculation (known as variolation after the introduction of smallpox <b>vaccine</b> <b>to</b> avoid possible confusion), which likely occurred in India, Africa, and China well before the practice arrived in Europe. However, the idea that inoculation originated in India has been challenged, as few of the ancient Sanskrit medical texts described the process of inoculation. Accounts of inoculation against smallpox in China can be found {{as early as the}} late 10th century, and the procedure was widely practiced by the 16th century, during the Ming dynasty. If successful, inoculation produced lasting immunity to smallpox. However, because the person was infected with variola virus, a severe infection could result, and the person could transmit smallpox to others. Variolation had a 0.5–2 percent mortality rate, considerably less than the 20–30 percent mortality rate of the disease. Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers.|$|E
5|$|Yuu's {{younger sister}} Ayumi {{eventually}} awakens {{an ability to}} cause anything around her to suddenly collapse, which results in her death. Yuu falls into a deep depression as a result and isolates himself, but Nao successfully manages to pull {{him out of his}} depression and gets him to return to the student council. While attending a concert of the post-rock band Zhiend with Nao, Yuu recollects previously suppressed memories of his brother Shunsuke, who has the ability to time travel. Shunsuke had used this ability to establish Hoshinoumi Academy and an affiliated organization attempting to develop a <b>vaccine</b> <b>to</b> prevent children from developing abilities before they manifest, but repeated use leaves him blind. Yuu learns that the true nature of his ability enables him to steal someone's ability by possessing them. Yuu steals Shunsuke's ability to go back in time and ultimately prevent Ayumi's death by stealing her collapse ability before she can use it.|$|E
