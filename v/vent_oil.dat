5000|$|Often {{criticized by}} marine writers (and some seamen) and {{considered}} difficult to maneuver and sluggish (comparisons to a [...] "bath tub" [...] and a [...] "beached whale" [...] were made), Thomas W. Lawson proved problematic in the ports she {{was intended to}} operate in due {{to the amount of}} water she displaced. She tended to yaw and needed a strong wind to be held on course. Originally built for the Pacific trade, the schooner was used as collier along the American East Coast. A year later in 1903, Crowley withdrew her from the coal trade. He had the topmasts, gaff booms and all other wooden spars removed and had chartered her out as a sea-going barge for the transportation of case oil. In 1906, she was retrofitted for sail at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company for use as a bulk oil carrier using the lower steel masts to <b>vent</b> <b>oil</b> gasses from the holds. Her capacity was 60,000 barrels. Under charter to Sun Oil Company, she was the world's first pure sailing tanker, carrying bulk oil from Texas to the eastern seaboard.|$|E

They can produce biofilm when subjected to environmental stresses such as extreme pH or temperature, high concentrations of metal, or the addition of antibiotics, xenobiotics, or oxygen. These archaeons are known to cause the corrosion of iron and steel in oil and gas processing systems by producing iron sulphide. Their biofilms, however, may have industrial or research applications in the form of detoxifying metal contaminated samples or to gather metals in an economically recoverable form.|$|R

40|$|We wish {{to add to}} {{the recent}} {{insightful}} comments of Wilcox et al. [1] regarding the thermodynamics of light alkane carboxylation. This process is particularly of industrial interest when it comes to methane which is <b>vented</b> at <b>oil</b> production sites where there are significant quantities of 2 ̆ 2 associated 2 ̆ 2 natural gas also being released. This is of course damaging environmentally. There are also many natural gas reservoirs in locations where there is no gas markets within a pipe-able distance. Thus the methane is 2 ̆ 2 stranded 2 ̆ 2 and any conversion to a liquid, such as the carboxylation discussed by Wilcox et al. is interesting from the point of making gas into a transportable liquid. Finally, the possibility of simultaneously capturing CO 2 as reported by Taniguchi et al. [2] is of great significance given the increasing occurrence of gas wells with 2 ̆ 6 gt; 15...|$|R
50|$|The Schlenk line (also vacuum gas manifold) is a {{commonly}} used chemistry apparatus developed by Wilhelm Schlenk. It {{consists of a}} dual manifold with several ports. One manifold is connected to a source of purified inert gas, while the other is connected to a vacuum pump. The inert-gas line is <b>vented</b> through an <b>oil</b> bubbler, while solvent vapors and gaseous reaction products are prevented from contaminating the vacuum pump by a liquid-nitrogen or dry-ice/acetone cold trap. Special stopcocks or Teflon taps allow vacuum or inert gas to be selected {{without the need for}} placing the sample on a separate line.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} gas <b>venting</b> from the <b>oil</b> {{industry}} is the atmospheric release of low pressure natural gas or contaminated gas {{to a safe}} location and at a concentration that avoids creation of a flammable or explosive mixture, or one that directly affects human health. Venting smaller volumes of low pressure gas can be the lowest cost and sometimes the only practicable option, particularly for limited durations and exceptional activities. Today, it is generally considered unacceptable in normal operations due to its environmental impact: natural gas has far greater global warming potential before than after combustion to CO2 and often contains harmful contaminants prior to processing.|$|R

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThe {{increase}} of anthropogenic activities {{is the main}} reason for the {{increase of}} methane emissions in the Netherlands. Methane is an important greenhouse gas. The most important sources in the Netherlands are landfills, cattle, manure and the exploration, transport and distribution of oil and gas. In this report the emissions of methane are calculated for 1989 - 1992 using IPCC methodology. Developments in the emissions for the years until 2015 are estimated. Scenario's are used of the Third National Environmental Outlook. The government aim to reduce methane emissions with 10 % by the year 2000 will only be effectuated if policies in the oil and gas sector, the livestock sector and the landfill sector are successful. Additional policy measures are feasible in landfill gas recovery and prevention of <b>venting</b> in the <b>oil</b> and gas sector. Cattle reduction are especially effective...|$|R
25|$|In 1906, Mauretania was {{launched}} by the Duchess of Roxburghe. At {{the time of her}} launch, she was the largest moving structure ever built, and slightly larger in gross tonnage than Lusitania. The main visual differences between Mauretania and Lusitania were that Mauretania was five feet longer and had different <b>vents</b> (Lusitania had <b>oil</b> drum-shaped <b>vents,</b> which proved fragile on winter runs and were eventually replaced with the cowl design vents of her sister ship). Mauretania also had two extra stages of turbine blades in her forward turbines, making her slightly faster than Lusitania. Mauretania and Lusitania were the only ships with direct-drive steam turbines to hold the Blue Riband; in later ships, reduction-geared turbines were mainly used. Mauretanias usage of the steam turbine was the largest application yet of the then-new technology, developed by Charles Algernon Parsons. During speed trials, these engines caused significant vibration at high speeds; in response, Mauretania received strengthening members aft and redesigned propellers before entering service, which reduced vibration.|$|R
50|$|On Missile 4B, the {{location}} of the lube <b>oil</b> <b>vent</b> lines was moved, and improved heat insulation added to the firewall and engine boots. It was successfully launched on August 2 from LC-13 on a 2500-mile flight. All systems functioned well and booster section separation, which was tested for the first time, occurred on schedule. Two problems occurred on 4B. The first involved high vibration levels following BECO; this was corrected by a few modifications to the autopilot, as well as moving the rate gyros forward slightly to increase their responsiveness to missile bending. The other was a repeat of the high helium usage on 3B, due to a suspected fault in the LOX tank pressure regulator. At T+155 seconds, the LOX tank pressure surged {{to the point where it}} went out of instrumentation range. Total helium usage for booster phase was 14 pounds higher than normal, and 11 pounds higher than normal during sustainer phase.|$|R
40|$|Pore fluids {{from the}} Green Canyon Block in the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico show distinct differences with respect to element concentrations and oxygen, hydrogen, and strontium isotope signatures. The shallowest of the three investigated sites (GC 185 or Bush Hill at 540 m water depth) is interpreted as a seafloor piercing mud mound and the two deeper areas (GC 415 East and West at 950 and 1050 m water depth) as gas <b>vent</b> and <b>oil</b> seep sites. All three locations accommodate near-surface gas hydrates and the sediment surface is populated with chemosynthetic communities. They are characterized by a distinct increase in salinity with depth. However, {{the origin of this}} increasing salinity is different for the GC 415 sites and Bush Hill and the depth source of the fluids is considerably different for all sites. The more saline fluids of the GC 415 sites result from the dissolution of halite by formation water from two different sources. The fluids of GC 415 East have most likely a deeper origin (early Cenozoic or even Mesozoic) and experienced elevated temperatures leading to mineral/water reactions including mineral transformations (e. g. smectite to illite transformation) and dissolution (e. g. feldspar dissolution). This process is expressed by the heavier oxygen isotope values and distinct Li, Sr, and Ca enrichments. The fluids of GC 415 West have a shallower origin which is expressed by a smaller enrichment in Li, Sr, and Ca and lighter oxygen isotopes. The fluids from Bush Hill are less saline and its fluid signature indicates intensive water/mineral interaction. Oxygen and hydrogen isotope values as well as Na/Cl and Br/Cl molar ratios suggest that the salt enrichment was caused by phase separation under sub-critical conditions. A simple heat flow model simulation suggests that sub-critical phase separation may have occurred at a depth of ∼ 1650 m at ∼ 350 °C...|$|R
50|$|A {{gear motor}} (external gear) {{consists}} of two gears, the driven gear (attached to the output shaft {{by way of a}} key, etc.) and the idler gear. High pressure oil is ported into one side of the gears, where it flows around the periphery of the gears, between the gear tips and the wall housings in which it resides, to the outlet port. The gears then mesh, not allowing the oil from the outlet side to flow back to the inlet side. For lubrication, the gear motor uses a small amount of oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and <b>vents</b> the same <b>oil</b> either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the motor housing. An especially positive attribute of the gear motor is that catastrophic breakdown is less common than in most other types of hydraulic motors. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the motor gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{chemical}} and physical changes which can occur to gas turbine lubricants as a result of exposure to operational conditions. The continual evolution toward more efficient gas turbines is accompanied by increasing thermal and mechanical loading which the lubricant must be able to withstand. In this thesis two major degradation issues are studied; thermal oxidative degradation and lubricant deposition. In the area of thermal oxidative degradation, efforts are made to better understand the key parameters which determine the lubricant breakdown mechanism. Through control of these parameters and comparison to service derived gas turbine oil samples a new laboratory methodology is proposed for the assessment of lubricant oxidative degradation. The study of lubricant deposition in this thesis is concentrated on the regions of highest risk, the bearing chamber feed (single phase) and <b>vent</b> (two phase) <b>oil</b> pipes. Development of existing laboratory scale deposition simulators was conducted to increase how engine representative the methods are of gas turbine conditions. These simulators were used to evaluate the rate of deposition with a range of lubricants, simulated engine cycles and pipe surfaces. ...|$|R
50|$|The Diablo GT was noticeably {{different}} on the exterior. While previous Diablo models had differed one from another with subtle fascia refinements or {{changes in the}} brake cooling ducts, the Diablo GT opted for an all new black carbon fiber front air dam with large brake ducts and a central <b>vent</b> for the <b>oil</b> cooler (the car still featured driving lamps, the single pair of round units featured on the Diablo VT Roadster). In the front luggage compartment lid, a large air extractor was added, while the small corner vents on the front fenders were changed to NACA style ducts. The fenders themselves were widened to accommodate a wider front track. In the rear, the bumper and its lamps were removed entirely, replaced by a carbon fiber diffuser that forced the fog and backup lamps into the outer pair of tail lamps, and shielded a pair of large center-mounted exhaust pipes. The engine lid featured a large central ram air duct protruding above the roof; a rear spoiler was standard equipment. This radical new body was composed mostly of carbon fiber, with the steel roof and aluminum doors being the only components to retain their standard material. Special 3-piece OZ wheels finished the GT's exterior package.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the oil cooler seals; this engine can also have an issue with {{the design of the}} positive crankcase ventilation system. The crankcase ventilation system vents to the inlet of the turbo. The issue is that the air vented from the crankcase contains too much oil to easily pass through the swirl motor valves downstream of the turbo. Once this oil and sludge begin to accumulate, the valve becomes inoperative and blows a fuse that controls many other sensors required to properly operate the engine and emission system. This will immediately place the vehicle into limp home mode and limit the rpm to 3000. It also causes a check engine light and numerous OBDII Codes. Mercedes Benz has previously recognized this feature of the vehicle and has stated that this engine feature, the accumulation of oil at the turbo inlet, is [...] "normal". In a Technical Service Bulletin they issued in 2008 they state:"Engine <b>oil</b> <b>venting</b> occurs on the right hand side of the engine air intake duct. For this reason there is always some oil in the engine air intake duct, see (Figure 3). This is no justification for replacing the turbocharger. Turbochargers replaced for this reason will not be covered by warranty." [...] While a slight amount of oil may be normal and acceptable, sufficient quantities and accumulation will indeed lead to other failures as identified above.|$|R
5000|$|Gear pumps (with {{external}} teeth) (fixed displacement) {{are simple}} and economical pumps. The swept volume or displacement of gear pumps for hydraulics will be between about 1 and 200 millilitres. They {{have the lowest}} volumetric efficiency ( [...] ) of all three basic pump types (gear, vane and piston pumps) These pumps create pressure through the meshing of the gear teeth, which forces fluid around the gears to pressurize the outlet side. For lubrication, the gear pump uses {{a small amount of}} oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and <b>vents</b> the same <b>oil</b> either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the pump housing. Some gear pumps can be quite noisy, compared to other types, but modern gear pumps are highly reliable and much quieter than older models. This is in part due to designs incorporating split gears, helical gear teeth and higher precision/quality tooth profiles that mesh and unmesh more smoothly, reducing pressure ripple and related detrimental problems. Another positive attribute of the gear pump, is that catastrophic breakdown is a lot less common than in most other types of hydraulic pumps. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the pump gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|R
40|$|Thermococcus {{may be an}} {{important}} alternative source of H 2 in the hot subseafloor in otherwise low H 2 environments such as some hydrothermal <b>vents</b> and <b>oil</b> reservoirs. It may also be useful in industry for rapid agricultural waste treatment and concomitant H 2 production. Thermococcus paralvinellae grown at 82 °C without sulfur produced up to 5 mmol of H 2 L- 1 at rates of 5 - 36 fmol H 2 cell- 1 h- 1 on 0. 5 % (wt vol- 1) maltose, 0. 5 % (wt vol- 1) tryptone, and 0. 5 % maltose + 0. 05 % tryptone media. Two potentially inhibiting conditions, the presence of 10 mM acetate and low pH (pH 5) in maltose-only medium, did not significantly affect growth or H 2 production. Growth rates, H 2 production rates, and cell yields based on H 2 production were the same as those for Pyrococcus furiosus grown at 95 °C on the same media for comparison. Acetate, butyrate, succinate, isovalerate and formate were also detected as end products. After 100 h, T. paralvinellae produced up to 5 mmol of H 2 L- 1 of medium when grown on up to 70 % (vol vol- 1) waste milk from cows undergoing treatment for mastitis with the bacterial antibiotic Ceftiofur and from untreated cows. The amount of H 2 produced by T. paralvinellae increased with increasing waste concentrations, but decreased in P. furiosus cultures supplemented with waste milk above 1 % concentration. All mesophilic bacteria from the waste milk that grew on Luria Bertani, Sheep’s Blood (selective for Staphylococcus, the typical cause of mastitis), and MacConkey (selective for Gram-negative enteric bacteria) agar plates were killed by heat during incubation at 82 °C. Ceftiofur, which is heat labile, was below the detection limit following incubation at 82 °C. T. paralvinellae also produced up to 6 mmol of H 2 L- 1 of medium when grown on 0. 1 - 10 % (wt vol- 1) spent brewery grain while P. furiosus produced < 1 mmol of H 2 L- 1. Twelve of 13 enzyme activities in T. paralvinellae showed significant (p< 0. 05) differences across six different growth conditions; however, methyl viologen-dependent membrane hydrogenase activity remained constant across all media types. The results demonstrate the potential of at least some Thermococcus species to produce H 2 if protein and α-glucosides are present as substrates...|$|R
2500|$|Oil sands {{extraction}} {{can affect}} the land when the bitumen is initially mined, water resources by its requirement for large quantities of water during separation of the oil and sand, and the air due {{to the release of}} carbon dioxide and other emissions. [...] Heavy metals such as vanadium, nickel, lead, cobalt, mercury, chromium, cadmium, arsenic, selenium, copper, manganese, iron and zinc are naturally present in oil sands and may be concentrated by the extraction process. [...] The environmental impact caused by oil sand extraction is frequently criticized by environmental groups such as Greenpeace, Climate Reality Project, Pembina Institute, 350.org, MoveOn.org, League of Conservation Voters, Patagonia, Sierra Club, and Energy Action Coalition. In particular, mercury contamination has been found around oil sands production in Alberta, Canada. The European Union has indicated that it may vote to label oil sands oil as [...] "highly polluting". Although oil sands exports to Europe are minimal, the issue has caused friction between the EU and Canada. According to the California-based Jacobs Consultancy, the European Union used inaccurate and incomplete data in assigning a high greenhouse gas rating to gasoline derived from Alberta’s oilsands. Also, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Russia do not provide data on how much natural gas is released via flaring or <b>venting</b> in the <b>oil</b> extraction process. The Jacobs report pointed out that extra carbon emissions from oil-sand crude are 12 percent higher than from regular crude, although it was assigned a GHG rating 22% above the conventional benchmark by EU.|$|R
5000|$|The B series {{test program}} took a {{considerable}} amount of delays and frustration, not in the least because the Atlas B was far more complicated than the prototype Atlas A, in fact the first launch would feature all hardware systems found on an operational Atlas, including the sustainer engine, separable booster section, guidance computer, Azusa tracking system, detachable nose cone, and more. The first flight article missile, 3B, was originally planned for launch in May 1958, but the date was set back by endless hardware difficulties, both with the missile itself and the newly opened LC-11. In addition, Atlas 3B could not be cleared for flight until a successful firing run of Missile 2B was performed at the Sycamore Canyon test stand, which was also experiencing nonstop technical issues. The launch of a third Soviet satellite in April also put further pressure on program planners. Finally on July 19, Missile 3B was launched. Engine start proceeded normally and the launcher release system functioned well. The Atlas performed well until T+21 seconds when the programmer attempted to initiate the pitch and roll maneuver. At this point, the missile began swerving from side to side uncontrollably and finally broke up at the forward end of the LOX tank at T+43 seconds, the thrust section and part of the RP-1 tank remaining in one piece until impact with the ocean. Even before the flight was terminated, technicians had determined the cause of the failure - ground crews had forgotten to power on the yaw gyro during prelaunch preparations. To prevent a recurrence of this, Convair began equipping the gyroscope packages with motion sensors to ensure proper operation, something that would eventually become a standard part of guided missile control systems. Atlas 3B was considered [...] "partially successful" [...] because all other systems had functioned properly. The only other abnormality was an unusually high usage of helium pressure gas, possibly due to a leak. If the flight had not terminated prematurely, the helium supply might have become depleted. Tank pressures however remained within normal levels until missile destruction. A minor thrust section fire was evident from T+9 seconds, caused by placement of the lube <b>oil</b> <b>vent</b> line near the booster turbine exhaust, however this was believed to have no connection to the subsequent loss of the missile. One telemetry channel failed during the prelaunch countdown, as a consequence 13 telemetry measurements were inactive during the flight.|$|R
