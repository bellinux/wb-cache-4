5|$|At {{the final}} whistle, Van Nistelrooy was {{immediately}} confronted by Arsenal players Martin Keown, Lauren, Ray Parlour, Ashley Cole and Kolo Touré. Keown jumped {{up next to}} Van Nistelrooy and brought his arms {{down hard on the}} Dutchman's back, while Lauren pushed Van Nistelrooy in the back and Parlour and Cole offered <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse.</b> Van Nistelrooy did not react and was escorted away by Manchester United captain Roy Keane, but the incident escalated away from the two of them. In defence of their teammate, Manchester United players Ryan Giggs, Cristiano Ronaldo, Gary Neville, Mikaël Silvestre, Quinton Fortune and Rio Ferdinand also became involved in the situation.|$|E

5|$|During his midget season, Crosby {{appeared}} on the CBC's Hockey Day in Canada telecast. He has recalled numerous instances in which opposing players intentionally attempted to injure him, as well as constant <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> from parents {{on and off the}} ice. Parents taunted and threatened Crosby so harshly, he took to not wearing his jersey between tournament games while he waited to play so {{that he would not be}} recognized. Due to this treatment, he elected to play for the American hockey program at Shattuck-Saint Mary's Boarding School, Minnesota for the 2002–03 hockey season. In 57 games with the Sabres, he recorded 72 goals and 162 points, leading the team to a U18 AAA national championship.|$|E
5|$|Caroline's main rival for Mac's {{affections}} is Sue White (Michelle Gomez), the Scottish staff {{liaison officer}} employed {{to listen and}} respond to the problems of East Hampton's staff. However, Sue is perhaps the least suited person for the job; she is mean-spirited, insensitive, unsympathetic, controlling and vain. Her office is a place where the impossible tends to happen, and anyone who enters is normally treated with a mixture of <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> and psychological torture, so she can get back to doing nothing, or thinking about how to upset the next visitor. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness, but Mac, like almost everyone else, tries his best to avoid her. Anyone who attempts to get involved with Mac is treated with contempt and hatred by Sue, in particular Caroline, whom Sue attempts several times to murder.|$|E
5|$|Macartney scored 2,207 runs {{during the}} tour {{at an average}} of 45.04. During the English season, he reached the peak of his {{performance}} as an all-rounder, taking 38 wickets. He made six centuries, including two in one match against Sussex. Apart from his 99 at Lord's, Macartney did not pass 34 in the other Tests and ended with 197 runs at 32.83. He did not bowl heavily during the series, taking six wickets at 23.66. It was not a happy tour for the Australians; without the senior players, there were frequent reports of drunken brawls and <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> towards the locals. Macartney was one of only four players to accept the guaranteed tour fee of 400 pounds; the others signed up to a percentage share of the profits and the commercial failure of the tour left them with {{less than half of the}} flat fee.|$|E

50|$|Several {{cases of}} verbal {{bullying}} {{were reported by}} several athletes and coaches to the Department of Education, and reports showed that parents of some athletes had been observed to have bullied some athletes especially those who were competing against their children.

25|$|Another {{prevalent}} form {{of violence}} in slums is armed violence (gun violence), mostly existing in African and Latin American slums. It leads to homicide {{and the emergence of}} criminal gangs. Typical victims are male slum residents. Violence often leads to retaliatory and vigilante violence within the slum. Gang and drug wars are endemic in some slums, predominantly between male residents of slums. The police sometimes participate in gender-based violence against men as well by picking up some men, beating them and putting them in jail. Domestic violence against men also exists in slums, including <b>verbal</b> <b>abuses</b> and even physical violence from households.|$|R
5|$|According to Sarma, Gandhi {{recruited}} {{women to}} participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity in the mainstream of Indian public life. However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because he feared he would be accused of using women as political shield. When women insisted that they join the movement and public demonstrations, according to Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join him. Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions and views, Indian women joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. After Gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> from British authorities for the cause in a manner Gandhi inspired.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E
5|$|An {{official}} {{in charge of}} ethnic and religious affairs in Guangdong said that the province had hired Uygurs, aged from 18 to 29, in May. A small group of Uyghurs arrived on 2 May, and workers at the factory remarked that {{relations between the two}} groups deteriorated as the number of Uyghurs increased. State media confirmed that all the workers were from Shufu County. China Labor Watch reported that workers at the Shaoguan factory, where the Uyghurs were employed, earned 28 yuan per day compared with 41.3 yuan in its factory in Shenzhen. They noted that rights of workers, Han and Uyghur alike, were frequently violated by <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> from factory supervisors, unpaid overtime, poor dormitory conditions and illegal labour contracts. Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch said that low pay, long hours and poor working conditions combined with the inability to communicate with their colleagues exacerbated deeply held mistrust between the Han and Uyghurs.|$|E
40|$|The take-home {{lesson from}} this survey of Australian {{anti-discrimination}} law {{is that the}} legislation offers only minimal protection to gay, lesbian, transgender or bisexual students who are <b>verbal</b> <b>abused</b> by other students.

Only the Northern Territory Act protects students from being harassed {{on the basis of their}} heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality or transsexuality, but this is by educational authorities, not other students. Vilification on the grounds of a person’s sexual orientation, sexuality or transgender status is only prohibited in NSW, Queensland and Tasmania.

5|$|The Boston Massacre, {{known as}} the Incident on King Street by the British, was an {{incident}} on March 5, 1770, in which British Army soldiers shot and killed people while under attack by a mob. The incident was heavily publicized by leading Patriots, such as Paul Revere and Samuel Adams, to encourage rebellion against the British authorities. British troops had been stationed in Boston, capital of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, since 1768 {{in order to protect}} and support crown-appointed colonial officials attempting to enforce unpopular Parliamentary legislation. Amid ongoing tense relations between the population and the soldiers, a mob formed around a British sentry, who was subjected to <b>verbal</b> <b>abuse</b> and harassment. He was eventually supported by eight additional soldiers, who were subjected to verbal threats and repeatedly hit by clubs, stones and snowballs. They fired into the crowd, without orders, instantly killing three people and wounding others. Two more people died later of wounds sustained in the incident.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To examine {{reports of}} <b>verbal</b> and {{physical}} <b>abuse</b> from family caregivers of adults with severe physical, neurological and developmental disabilities, and examine possible associations of abuse with family caregiver adjustment. Design: Cross-sectional. Participants: 147 community-residing caregivers (129 women, 18 men) of adults with disabilities (66 men, 81 women). Measures: Caregiver burden, life satisfaction, depression, health complaints, supervision provided {{to a family}} member with a disability, and care-recipient agitation and functional impairment. A brief measure of <b>verbal</b> and physical <b>abuse</b> experienced {{over the previous year}} was administered to the caregiver. Results: 51 % of the sample reported some form of abuse in the twelve months prior to assessment. Caregivers who reported some form of abuse reported significantly greater distress and burden than caregivers who did not report any abuse. Conclusions: Caregivers who experience <b>verbal</b> and physical <b>abuse</b> may be at risk for increased emotional difficulties and have a greater sense of caregiver burden than caregivers who do not experience abuse. These data indicate that clinicians should attend to incidents of <b>verbal</b> and physical <b>abuse</b> that may occur between caregiver - care-recipient dyads. Further research is required to determine the conditions under which such abuse is likely to occur...|$|R

One of Lasso’s two such compositions extends the geographic boundaries of the theme to remote Hungary. „Bestia curvafia pulices” turns up in a poem that Lasso set to music and published in his Les melanges in 1576. „Bestia curvafia” [whoreson beast] was an expression in Hungarian, which for centuries {{was one of the most}} common <b>verbal</b> <b>abuses.</b> The first registered occurrence of the defamation bestia curvafia is from 1507.

2500|$|Stories {{of sexual}} {{violence}} with perpetrators shouting anti-Chinese slogans and other <b>verbal</b> <b>abuses</b> during the Jakarta riots shocked Indonesians. As the incidents were represented as state-sponsored violence, {{national and international}} groups became more vocal in calling for reform and the government to step down. Muhammadiyah leader Amien Rais denounced the violence in Surakarta, which he saw as more destructive than the riots on Jakarta. The Islamic organisation manages the UMS campus, where student clashes with police on 14 May prompted the ensuing violence. His statement that the Surakarta incident was orchestrated by a [...] (puppeteer) rather than unorganised masses became a national headline. Unlike in Jakarta, local citizens in Surakarta did not view the violence in their city as anti-Chinese. This image was further cultivated by the insistence of influential Chinese Indonesians that the causes were [...] "multifaceted". Most of the Chinese who fled during the violence returned after it had subsided, unlike those in Medan in Jakarta.|$|R
