25|$|The newly invented Western Electric {{moving coil}} or dynamic {{microphone}} {{was part of}} the Wide Range System. It had a flatter audio response than the old style Wente condenser type and didn't require electronics installed in the microphone housing. Signals fed to the cutting head were pre-emphasized in the treble region to help override noise in playback. Groove cuts in the vertical plane were employed rather than the usual lateral cuts. The chief advantage claimed was more grooves per inch that could be crowded together, resulting in longer playback time. Additionally, the problem of inner groove distortion, which plagued lateral cuts, could be avoided with the <b>vertical</b> <b>cut</b> system. Wax masters were made by flowing heated wax over a hot metal disc thus avoiding the microscopic irregularities of cast blocks of wax and the necessity of planing and polishing.|$|E
25|$|When {{dragged through}} a field the coulter cuts {{down into the}} soil and the share cuts {{horizontally}} from the previous furrow to the <b>vertical</b> <b>cut.</b> This releases a rectangular strip of sod that is then lifted by the share and carried by the mouldboard up and over, so that the strip of sod (slice of the topsoil) that is being cut lifts and rolls over as the plough moves forward, dropping {{back to the ground}} upside down into the furrow and onto the turned soil from the previous run down the field. Each gap in the ground where the soil has been lifted and moved across (usually to the right) is called a furrow. The sod that has been lifted from it rests at about a 45 degree angle in the next-door furrow and lies up the back of the sod from the previous run.|$|E
500|$|The Copán {{buildings}} suffered {{significantly from}} {{forces of nature}} in the centuries between the site's abandonment and the rediscovery of the ruins. After the abandonment of the city the Copán River gradually changed course, with a meander destroying the eastern portion of the acropolis (revealing in the process its archaeological stratigraphy in a large <b>vertical</b> <b>cut)</b> and apparently washing away various subsidiary architectural groups, including at least one courtyard and 10 buildings from Group 10L2. The cut is an important archaeological feature at the site, with the natural erosion having created an enormous cross-section of the acropolis. This erosion cut away {{a large portion of}} the eastern part of the acropolis and revealed a vertical cross-section that measures [...] high at its tallest point and [...] long. Several buildings recorded in the 19thcentury were destroyed, plus an unknown amount of the acropolis that was eroded before it could be recorded. In order to avoid further destruction of the acropolis, the Carnegie Institution redirected the river to save the archaeological site, diverting it southwards in the 1930s; the dry former riverbed was finally filled in at the same time as consolidation of the cut in 1990s. Structures 10L19, 20, 20A and 21 were all destroyed by the Copán River as it eroded the site away, but had been recorded by investigators in the 19thcentury.|$|E

In <b>vertical</b> <b>cuts</b> taken well-away from the nucleus, no halo emission is detected. To our detection limit, these data are well modeled by a spherically symmetric component having an exponential radial surface brightness profile plus a sech(z) disk. The exponential radial surface brightness profile suggests an unusually faint and extended spiral bulge. A ae / r Γ 3 : 5 spheroid plus sech(z) disk is nearly as good a fit. It is also possible to fit these data with a ae / r Γ 2 component tracing the massive halo. However, this requires a larger error in setting the sky level than appears likely.

[...] In the other ossuaries and burials the bones had been taken out from a side of a <b>vertical</b> <b>cut,</b> in this ossuary the archaeologist (T. Dale Stewart) worked down and exposed the upper surfaces before removing them. [...] This permitted a better observation of the arrangement of skeletons. [...] All the skeletons were laid in no particular direction. [...] An unusual thing about this ossuary is that some of the skeletons had their lower legs bent unnaturally forward at the knee. [...] There were 135 skeletons, 63 adult and 72 children. [...] The archaeologist determined 34 of the adults to be male, 27 to be female, and two he was unsure of. [...] Shell beads were the most common artifact. [...] In one skull a lot of different kinds of beads were found and this is evidence of secondary burial. [...] There was more evidence of secondary burial because of burnt bones. [...] An unusual artifact was a three-foot piece of pine heartwood. [...] This was on top of the bones on the north side. [...] It is thought that the wood was used to carry the bodies to the pit and then put in afterwards. [...] The wood could also be a type of burial structure or something ceremonial. [...] The discovery of mud dauber nests with some of the skeletons supports the interpretation that these were secondary burials. [...] Mud daubers do not build their nests underground showing that the remains were left above ground while they decomposed and were then buried.|$|E
