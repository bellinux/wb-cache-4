40|$|Soy {{lecithin}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular emulsifiers in processed foods. In chocolate production, it is used as a key ingredient which prevents the separation of sugar particles from cocoa butter and cocoa solid (and optionally milk solid) particles. Chocolate flow behaviour is of big concern for the industrial manufacturers. This is because the chocolate flow behaviour largely affects the final characteristics of chocolate. Therefore, it is necessary for the producers to control the flow behaviour which is represented by two parameters: yield stress and viscosity. As lecithin is a natural by-product of vegetal oil processing, its composition varies depending on the origin, weather conditions, storage and processing conditions. It is a complex mixture of surface active and non-surface active components exhibiting a variable composition. As a consequence, its functionality is inconsistent which subsequently affects the chocolate flow behaviour and the final chocolate applications. As steering the chocolate yield stress is more difficult than the <b>viscosity,</b> <b>controlling</b> the yield stress is a fundamental technological challenge. In order to have a better control over the chocolate flow parameters, especially the yield stress, an understanding of the structure-function relation of polar lipids in liquid chocolate should be established. In this research, three different types of polar lipids from vegetal, animal and synthetic sources were investigated in an effort to explore this relation...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} an alternative chemical formulation {{using a new}} polymeric surfactant to improve the conventional alkali/surfactant/polymer (ASP) flooding. It is a one-component system for interfacial tension reduction and <b>viscosity</b> <b>control.</b> To simulate the conventional ASP flooding, {{the performance of the}} polymeric surfactant was studied in the absence and presence of sodium carbonate. The most outstanding feature of the new polymeric surfactant lies in its viscosity insensitivity towards an increasing alkali concentration up to 1.2  wt%. This feature makes the new formula superior to the conventional ASP process. A combination of alkali and surfactant with a concentration of 0.8 and 0.4  wt% was found to significantly reduce the interfacial tension while maintaining the desired solution viscosity. The optimal polymeric surfactant concentration was then validated in coreflood experiments using different surfactant concentrations. Using the optimum surfactant and alkali concentrations, tertiary oil recovery could reach 16.3  % of the original oil in place by injecting a 0.5 pore volume of the formulated slug. This makes the new polymeric surfactant promising because it has structural feature that can be modified to give a width range of interfacial tension reduction and <b>viscosity</b> <b>control</b> to suit reservoir conditions.|$|R

This type of actuator has the capability to communicate with computer to give better control, higher position and force accuracy. In prior to that, several experimental setup for the stiffness and <b>viscosity</b> <b>control</b> had been done using conventional PI controller.

In this project, the work focuses more on the reverse engineering method, which is from existing real IPA system which had been developed by Dr. Ahmad ‘Athif Mohd Faudzi, to simulation analysis for the validation of other controllers. The objectives of this project are to develop a simulation model to represent the real IPA system, and design other controllers to be applied in this developed simulation model.
