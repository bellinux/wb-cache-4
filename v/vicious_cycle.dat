5|$|The {{mandate and}} the limits on open {{enrollment}} were designed to avoid the insurance death spiral in which healthy people delay insuring themselves until they get sick.

5|$|Given {{the role}} of {{mitochondria}} as the cell's powerhouse, {{there may be some}} leakage of the high-energy electrons in the respiratory chain to form reactive oxygen species. This was thought to result in significant oxidative stress in the mitochondria with high mutation rates of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Hypothesized links between aging and oxidative stress are not new and were proposed in 1956, which was later refined into the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging. A <b>vicious</b> <b>cycle</b> was thought to occur, as oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial DNA mutations, which can lead to enzymatic abnormalities and further oxidative stress.|$|E

5|$|Mitochondria-mediated {{oxidative}} stress {{plays a role}} in cardiomyopathy in Type 2 diabetics. Increased fatty acid delivery to the heart increases fatty acid uptake by cardiomyocytes, resulting in increased fatty acid oxidation in these cells. This process increases the reducing equivalents available to the electron transport chain of the mitochondria, ultimately increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS increases uncoupling proteins (UCPs) and potentiate proton leakage through the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), the combination of which uncouples the mitochondria. Uncoupling then increases oxygen consumption by the mitochondria, compounding the increase in fatty acid oxidation. This creates a <b>vicious</b> <b>cycle</b> of uncoupling; furthermore, even though oxygen consumption increases, ATP synthesis does not increase proportionally because the mitochondria is uncoupled. Less ATP availability ultimately results in an energy deficit presenting as reduced cardiac efficiency and contractile dysfunction. To compound the problem, impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release and reduced mitochondrial reuptake limits peak cytosolic levels of the important signaling ion during muscle contraction. The decreased intra-mitochondrial calcium concentration increases dehydrogenase activation and ATP synthesis. So in addition to lower ATP synthesis due to fatty acid oxidation, ATP synthesis is impaired by poor calcium signaling as well, causing cardiac problems for diabetics.|$|E

25|$|Tax {{avoidance}} {{strategies and}} loopholes tend to emerge within income tax codes. They get created when taxpayers find legal methods {{to avoid paying}} taxes. Lawmakers then attempt to close the loopholes with additional legislation. That leads to a <b>vicious</b> <b>cycle</b> of ever more complex avoidance strategies and legislation. The <b>vicious</b> <b>cycle</b> tends to benefit large corporations and wealthy individuals that can afford the professional fees that come with ever more sophisticated tax planning, thus challenging the notion that even a marginal income tax system can be properly called progressive.|$|E

5000|$|The general {{thesis is}} that time distortions disrupt anticipatory control {{and lead to}} psychopathological spirals.

25|$|Obesity can unfavorably alter {{hormonal}} and metabolic status via {{resistance to}} the hormone leptin, and a <b>vicious</b> <b>cycle</b> may occur in which insulin/leptin resistance and obesity aggravate one another. The <b>vicious</b> <b>cycle</b> is putatively fueled by continuously high insulin/leptin stimulation and fat storage, {{as a result of}} high intake of strongly insulin/leptin stimulating foods and energy. Both insulin and leptin normally function as satiety signals to the hypothalamus in the brain; however, insulin/leptin resistance may reduce this signal and therefore allow continued overfeeding despite large body fat stores. In addition, reduced leptin signaling to the brain may reduce leptin's normal effect to maintain an appropriately high metabolic rate.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlmost {{four years}} after Greece's entry to a {{financial}} support programme, the Greek economy is still facing recession. The aim {{of this article is}} to analyse the interconnections between five <b>vicious</b> <b>cycles</b> of recession and highlight the country's development prospects. The five <b>vicious</b> <b>cycles</b> of the Greek economy are as follows: a) fiscal, b) internal devaluation, c) financial, d) psychological, and e) sociopolitical. These five vicious circles of recession must be seen in parallel with the adjustment policy applied. The results of this policy have created the preconditions for the maintenance of the recession. Also, other deficits of the adjustment policy and structural weaknesses of the Greek economy continue to limit the prospects of recovery for the Greek economy. We conclude with certain suggestions that might enable Greece to overcome the major obstacles to economic development...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an argument for}} the clinical and empirical relevance of case study material. Drawing {{on a series of}} systematic case studies based in Stiles 19 s (2007) model of theory building, the author proposes adding the concepts of avoidance and <b>vicious</b> <b>cycles</b> to standard transactional analysis and offers case material to illustrate the usefulness of doing so. Avoidance and <b>vicious</b> <b>cycles</b> are proposed as key mechanisms in the maintenance of the client 19 s problems, specifically depression and anxiety, but also in relation to other presenting problems. The article also proposes experiential disconfirmation as an active change mechanism in transactional analysis therapy whereby the therapist actively challenges the client 19 s life script and promotes change at an experiential level. These concepts forge links between several transactional analysis concepts and provide a unifying framework for a range of TA therapy approaches...|$|R
40|$|Summaries The central {{argument}} {{of this article}} is that a central feature of post?Cold War conflicts has been the delegitimisation of public authority, interacting with globalisation, through a process which is almost the reverse of state and nation?building. The political economy of the ‘new wars’ involves a mix of state and non?state, national and international violence. It creates <b>vicious</b> <b>cycles,</b> reinforcing the decline in the formal sector, breaking down the distinction between public and private spheres, and mobilising identity cleavages through strategies of fear and hate directed against civilians. These <b>vicious</b> <b>cycles</b> can only be broken by peace strategies, whose centrepiece, over the longer run, is the restoration of legitimate authority and the democratisation of politics. These strategies cannot, {{in a world in which}} the state has been eroded, be confined just to the state, but must also involve many other layers of political authority, from the local to the global...|$|R

25|$|These {{three basic}} drives have been {{compared}} to the Freudian drive theory of libido, ego, and thanatos respectively (de Silva, 1973).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} formulates {{and describes}} the Discrepancy Model. The Discrepancy Model {{is a process}} model showing how problems in relationships can develop into <b>vicious</b> <b>cycles</b> that further damage the relationship. A generic process model provides the foundation for describing a Discrepancy Model specifically related {{to the development of}} alcohol problems. The Discrepancy Model combines research and models in the fields of cognitive dissonance and consistency theories, attribution theory, family systems, and the Attention Allocation Model. The Attention Allocation Model describes an effect of intoxication on information processing capacity. The Discrepancy Model for developing alcohol problems will not rely on biological vulnerability, but allows that such vulnerability exists for some people. The model produces hypotheses concerning drinkers, spouses, and interventions that can change the development of <b>vicious</b> <b>cycles.</b> The strengths and limitations of the model, and implications for research are discussed. A limitation to each of the lines of research used is low, but significant, correlations and small effect sizes. The discrepancy model suggests a number of predicted results so evaluations on constituents and path analyses can be conducted to explore the its value...|$|R
