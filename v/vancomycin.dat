5|$|In March 2007, the FDA {{reported}} {{the results of}} a randomized, open-label, phase III clinical trial comparing linezolid to <b>vancomycin</b> in the treatment of catheter-related bloodstream infections. Patients treated with <b>vancomycin</b> could be switched to oxacillin or dicloxacillin if the bacteria that caused their infection was found to be susceptible, and patients in both groups (linezolid and <b>vancomycin)</b> could receive specific treatment against Gram-negative bacteria if necessary. The study itself was published in January 2009.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is used {{in cases}} of {{suspected}} toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as <b>vancomycin.</b> The rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between <b>vancomycin,</b> which causes {{the death of the}} bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis).|$|E
5|$|Linezolid {{has been}} studied as an {{alternative}} to <b>vancomycin</b> in the treatment of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients when Gram-positive infection is suspected. It is also one of few antibiotics that diffuse into the vitreous humor, and may therefore be effective in treating endophthalmitis (inflammation of the inner linings and cavities of the eye) caused by susceptible bacteria. Again, there is little evidence for its use in this setting, as infectious endophthalmitis is treated widely and effectively with <b>vancomycin</b> injected directly into the eye.|$|E
5|$|A large {{meta-analysis}} of randomized controlled trials found linezolid {{to be more}} effective than glycopeptide antibiotics (such as <b>vancomycin</b> and teicoplanin) and beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and smaller studies appear to confirm its superiority over teicoplanin in the treatment of all serious Gram-positive infections.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid's {{spectrum}} of activity against Gram-positive bacteria {{is similar to that}} of the glycopeptide antibiotic <b>vancomycin,</b> which has long been the standard for treatment of MRSA infections, and the two drugs are often compared. Other comparable antibiotics include teicoplanin (trade name Targocid, a glycopeptide like <b>vancomycin),</b> quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid, a combination of two streptogramins, not active against E. faecalis), and daptomycin (Cubicin, a lipopeptide), and some agents still being developed, such as ceftobiprole, dalbavancin, and telavancin. Linezolid is the only one that can be taken by mouth. In the future, oritavancin and iclaprim may be useful oral alternatives to linezolid—both are in the early stages of clinical development.|$|E
5|$|In the {{treatment}} of diabetic foot infections, linezolid appears to be cheaper and more effective than <b>vancomycin.</b> In a 2004 open-label study, it was as effective as ampicillin/sulbactam and Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and far superior in patients with foot ulcers and no osteomyelitis, but with significantly higher rates of adverse effects. A 2008 meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials, however, found that linezolid treatment failed as often as other antibiotics, regardless of whether patients had osteomyelitis.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{advantages}} of linezolid is its high bioavailability (close to 100%) when given by mouth: the entire dose reaches the bloodstream, {{as if it had been}} given intravenously. This means that people receiving intravenous linezolid may be switched to oral linezolid as soon as their condition allows it, whereas comparable antibiotics (such as <b>vancomycin</b> and quinupristin/dalfopristin) can only be given intravenously.|$|E
5|$|Penicillin {{has been}} {{suggested}} as the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} S.iniae infection in mammals, including humans. In the 1995–1996 cluster of human cases, all clinical s were susceptible to penicillin, several cephalosporins, clindamycin, erythromycin, and co-trimoxazole (MICs 0.25µg/ml); all nine patients were treated with parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics and recovered uneventfully. A study of isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2000 and 2004 found all to be sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, and <b>vancomycin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} in several countries with different health care system models to assess the cost-effectiveness of linezolid compared to glycopeptides such as <b>vancomycin</b> or teicoplanin. In most countries, linezolid was more cost-effective than comparable antibiotics {{for the treatment of}} hospital-acquired pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections, either due to higher cure and survival rates or lower overall treatment costs.|$|E
5|$|The {{detected}} compounds are polyols {{and have}} an antifungal and antibacterial effect, especially in connection with Gram-positive bacteria. H.olivaceoalbus is therefore {{an important source of}} antibiotics, especially as the hygrophorones also show an effect on bacterial cultures that are resistant against contemporary antibiotics such as methicillin, ciprofloxacin or <b>vancomycin.</b> The fungus has been used in Traditional Chinese medicine, where it is known for its curing components, such as 4-, 6- or 4,5,6-tri-O-acetyl hygrophorones B14.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for gastroenteritis, {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or <b>vancomycin.</b> Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and <b>vancomycin</b> inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E
5|$|HSP {{can develop}} after infections with streptococci (β-haemolytic, Lancefield group A), {{hepatitis}} B, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, Coxsackievirus, adenovirus, Helicobacter pylori, measles, mumps, rubella, Mycoplasma and numerous others. Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an idiosyncratic reaction, include the antibiotics <b>vancomycin</b> and cefuroxime, ACE inhibitors enalapril and captopril, anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, {{as well as}} ranitidine and streptokinase. Several diseases {{have been reported to}} be associated with HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced to any of these causes.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid was {{associated}} with significantly greater mortality than the comparator antibiotics. When data from all participants were pooled, {{the study found that}} 21.5% of those given linezolid died, compared to 16% of those not receiving it. The difference was found to be due to the inferiority of linezolid in the treatment of Gram-negative infections alone or mixed Gram-negative/Gram-positive infections. In participants whose infection was due to Gram-positive bacteria alone, linezolid was as safe and effective as <b>vancomycin.</b> In light of these results, the FDA issued an alert reminding healthcare professionals that linezolid is not approved for the treatment of catheter-related infections or infections caused by Gram-negative organisms, and that more appropriate therapy should be instituted whenever a Gram-negative infection is confirmed or suspected.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid was {{discovered}} in the mid 1990s and was approved for commercial use in 2000. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. Linezolid is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about US$ 2.90 USD per day while that in the United States as of 2016 is about US$13.79 per day. It appears to be more cost-effective than alternatives such as <b>vancomycin,</b> mostly because of the ability to switch from intravenous use to administration by mouth sooner.|$|E
5|$|No {{significant}} difference appears in treatment success rates between linezolid, glycopeptides, or appropriate beta-lactam antibiotics {{in the treatment}} of pneumonia. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend that linezolid be reserved for cases in which MRSA has been confirmed as the causative organism, or when MRSA infection is suspected based on the clinical presentation. The guidelines of the British Thoracic Society do not recommend it as first-line treatment, but rather as an alternative to <b>vancomycin.</b> Linezolid is also an acceptable second-line treatment for community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia when penicillin resistance is present.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{function}} by binding {{to specific}} locations on target molecules and causing some desired change, such as disabling a target or causing a conformational change. Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, {{it is difficult}} to precisely determine where and how tightly two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current in silico methods usually must trade speed for accuracy; e.g., use rapid protein docking methods instead of computationally costly free energy calculations. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability. Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery. In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the villin protein to within 1.8 angstrom (Å) root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the crystalline structure experimentally determined through X-ray crystallography. This accuracy has implications to future protein structure prediction methods, including for intrinsically unstructured proteins. Scientists have used Folding@home to research drug resistance by studying <b>vancomycin,</b> an antibiotic drug of last resort, and beta-lactamase, a protein that can break down antibiotics like penicillin.|$|E
5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} {{possess a}} thick cell wall containing {{many layers of}} peptidoglycan and teichoic acids. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Lipopolysaccharides, also called endotoxins, are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A {{that is responsible for}} much of the toxicity of gram-negative bacteria. Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall, and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram-positive arrangement. These two groups were previously known as the low G+C and high G+C gram-positive bacteria, respectively. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, <b>vancomycin</b> can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast, whereas if it is partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. The enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defence against eye infections.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vancomycin</b> by {{mouth is}} {{preferred}} for severe disease. Additionally, <b>vancomycin</b> {{may be used}} to treat mild-to-moderate disease if diarrhea persists after a course of metronidazole. Since metronidazole has the potential to cause birth defects, pregnant women with Clostridium difficile infection may be treated with <b>vancomycin</b> regardless of disease severity. <b>Vancomycin</b> may be more effective than metronidazole. Typical <b>vancomycin</b> dosage is taken four times daily for 10 days. Vancomyin may be given rectally if the person develops an ileus and cannot take medications by mouth.|$|E
25|$|One {{mechanism}} {{of resistance to}} <b>vancomycin</b> involves the alteration to the terminal amino acid residues of the NAM/NAG-peptide subunits, under normal conditions, D-alanyl-D-alanine, to which <b>vancomycin</b> binds. The D-alanyl-D-lactate variation results {{in the loss of}} one hydrogen-bonding interaction (4, as opposed to 5 for D-alanyl-D-alanine) possible between <b>vancomycin</b> and the peptide. This loss of just one point of interaction results in a 1000-fold decrease in affinity. The D-alanyl-D-serine variation causes a six-fold loss of affinity between <b>vancomycin</b> and the peptide, likely due to steric hindrance.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{antibiotic}} therapy for less-severe Clostridium difficile colitis (pseudomembranous colitis) consists of oral metronidazole or oral <b>vancomycin.</b> Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated equivalent efficacy of oral metronidazole and oral <b>vancomycin</b> in treating this colitis. However, oral <b>vancomycin</b> {{is shown to}} be more effective in treating patients with severe C. difficile colitis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vancomycin</b> is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of serious, life-threatening infections by Gram-positive bacteria unresponsive to other antibiotics. In particular, <b>vancomycin</b> should not be used to treat methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus because it is inferior to penicillins such as nafcillin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vancomycin</b> acts by {{inhibiting}} proper {{cell wall}} synthesis in Gram-positive bacteria. Due {{to the different}} mechanism by which Gram-negative bacteria produce their cell walls and the various factors related to entering the outer membrane of Gram-negative organisms, <b>vancomycin</b> is not active against them (except some nongonococcal species of Neisseria).|$|E
25|$|<b>Vancomycin</b> {{has been}} a {{successful}} target in total synthesis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vancomycin</b> {{is made by}} {{the soil}} {{bacterium}} Amycolatopsis orientalis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vancomycin</b> {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1953 by Edmund Kornfeld (working at Eli Lilly) from a soil sample {{collected from the}} interior jungles of Borneo by a missionary. The organism that produced it was eventually named Amycolatopsis orientalis. The original indication for <b>vancomycin</b> was {{for the treatment of}} penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vancomycin</b> can {{induce a}} linear IgA bullous {{dermatosis}} in some patients.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vancomycin</b> {{biosynthesis}} occurs via different nonribosomal protein synthases (NRPSs). The enzymes {{determine the}} {{amino acid sequence}} during its assembly through its 7 modules. Before <b>vancomycin</b> is assembled through NRPS, the amino acids are first modified. L-tyrosine is modified to become the β-hydroxychlorotyrosine (β-hTyr) and 4-hydroxyphenylglycine (HPG) residues. However, acetate is used to derive the 3,5 dihydroxyphenylglycine ring (3,5-DPG).|$|E
25|$|Damage to {{the kidneys}} {{and to the}} hearing were {{a side effect of}} the early impure {{versions}} of <b>vancomycin,</b> and these were prominent in the clinical trials conducted in the mid-1950s. Later trials using purer forms of <b>vancomycin</b> found nephrotoxicity is an infrequent adverse effect (0.1% to 1% of patients), but this is accentuated in the presence of aminoglycosides.|$|E
25|$|A few Gram-positive {{bacteria}} are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin: Leuconostoc and Pediococcus species, but these organisms rarely cause diseases in humans. Most Lactobacillus species are also intrinsically resistant to <b>vancomycin,</b> {{with the exception}} of L. acidophilus and L. delbruekii, which are sensitive. Other Gram-positive bacteria with intrinsic resistance to <b>vancomycin</b> include Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Weissella confusa, and Clostridium innocuum.|$|E
25|$|Fidaxomicin {{has been}} found to be as {{effective}} as <b>vancomycin</b> in those with mild to moderate disease and may be better in those with severe disease. It is tolerated as well as <b>vancomycin,</b> and may have a lower risk of recurrence. It may be used in those who have recurrent infections and have not responded to other antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|Another area of {{controversy}} and uncertainty concerns {{the question of}} whether, and if so, to what extent, <b>vancomycin</b> increases the toxicity of other nephrotoxins. Clinical studies have yielded variable results, but animal models indicate some increased nephrotoxic effect probably occurs when <b>vancomycin</b> is added to nephrotoxins such as aminoglycosides. However, a dose- or serum level-effect relationship has not been established.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vancomycin</b> is an {{antibiotic}} {{used to treat}} a number of bacterial infections. It is recommended intravenously {{as a treatment for}} complicated skin infections, bloodstream infections, endocarditis, bone and joint infections, and meningitis caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Blood levels may be measured to determine the correct dose. <b>Vancomycin</b> is also recommended by mouth as a treatment for severe Clostridium difficile colitis. When taken by mouth it is very poorly absorbed.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (≥1% of patients) {{associated with}} IV <b>vancomycin</b> include: local pain, {{which may be}} severe, and thrombophlebitis.|$|E
25|$|Inhaled <b>vancomycin</b> {{has also}} been used (off-label), via nebulizer, for {{treatment}} of various infections of {{the upper and lower}} respiratory tract.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vancomycin</b> can induce platelet-reactive {{antibodies}} in the patient, {{leading to}} severe thrombocytopenia and bleeding with florid petechial hemorrhages, ecchymoses, and wet purpura.|$|E
