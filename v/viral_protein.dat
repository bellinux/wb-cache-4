5|$|HIV is {{different}} in structure from other retroviruses. It is roughly spherical with a diameter of about 120nm, around 60times smaller than a red blood cell. It is composed of two copies of positive single-stranded RNA that codes for the virus's nine genes enclosed by a conical capsid composed of 2,000 copies of the <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> p24. The single-stranded RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7, and enzymes needed {{for the development of}} the virion such as reverse transcriptase, proteases, ribonuclease and integrase. A matrix composed of the <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring the integrity of the virion particle.|$|E
5|$|As {{the sole}} <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> {{on the surface}} of the virus, the Envelope protein is a major target for HIV vaccine efforts. Over half of the mass of the trimeric {{envelope}} spike is N-linked glycans. The density is high as the glycans shield the underlying <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> from neutralisation by antibodies. This is one of the most densely glycosylated molecules known and the density is sufficiently high to prevent the normal maturation process of glycans during biogenesis in the endoplasmic and Golgi apparatus. The majority of the glycans are therefore stalled as immature 'high-mannose' glycans not normally present on secreted or cell surface human glycoproteins. The unusual processing and high density means that almost all broadly neutralising antibodies that have so far been identified (from a subset of patients that have been infected for many months to years) bind to or, are adapted to cope with, these envelope glycans.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus is a positive-stranded RNA virus. Thus, {{the genome}} {{enclosed}} within the viral particle {{can be used}} as messenger RNA and immediately translated by the host cell. On entry, the virus hijacks the cell's translation machinery, causing inhibition of cellular protein synthesis in favor of virus–specific protein production. Unlike the host cell's mRNAs, the 5'end of poliovirus RNA is extremely long—over 700 nucleotides—and highly structured. This region of the viral genome is called internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and it directs translation of the viral RNA. Genetic mutations in this region prevent <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> production. The first IRES to be discovered was found in poliovirus RNA.|$|E

25|$|Picornaviruses have a <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> (VPg) covalently {{linked to}} 5’ {{end of their}} genomes instead of 7-methylguanosine cap like {{cellular}} mRNAs. Virus RNA polymerases use VPg as primer. VPg as primer uses both minus and plus strand RNA synthesis. Picornavirus replication is initiated by the uridylylation of <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> genome-linked (VPg).It is uridylylated at the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue.|$|E

25|$|<b>Viral</b> <b>protein</b> C binds to {{replication}} complex, inducing packaging of new viral positive-stranded DNA into procapsids. The preinitiation complex {{consists of}} the host cell protein rep and viral A and C proteins. These associate with the procapsid forming a 50S complex.|$|E
25|$|The RNA {{segments}} of the viral genome have complementary base sequences at the terminal ends, allowing them to bond to each other with hydrogen bonds. After transcription from negative-sense to positive-sense RNA takes place, the positive-sense RNA strands are capped on the 5’ end by a process called cap snatching. This involves the <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> NS1 binding to the host cell’s early messenger RNA transcripts. A second <b>viral</b> <b>protein,</b> PA, cleaves the cap from the host’s RNA. The short cap is then added to the influenza positive-sense RNA strands, allowing it to be processed by ribosomes and translated into its protein products. The positive-sense RNA strands also serve for synthesis of negative-sense RNA strands for new virions.|$|E

25|$|The {{papillomavirus}} capsid {{also contains}} a <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> known as L2, which is less abundant. Although not clear how L2 is arranged within the virion, it is known to perform several important functions, including facilitating the packaging of the viral genome into nascent virions {{as well as the}} infectious entry of the virus into new host cells. L2 is of interest as a possible target for more broadly protective HPV vaccines.|$|E
25|$|The virus {{replicates}} on intracellular lipid membranes. The {{endoplasmic reticulum}} {{in particular are}} deformed into uniquely shaped membrane structures termed 'membranous webs'. These structures can be induced by sole expression of the <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> NS4B. The core protein associates with lipid droplets and utilises microtubules and dyneins to alter their location to a perinuclear distribution. Release from the hepatocyte may involve the very low density lipoprotein secretory pathway.|$|E

500|$|Poliovirus mRNA is {{translated}} as one long polypeptide. This polypeptide is then autocleaved by internal proteases into about 10 individual <b>viral</b> <b>proteins.</b> Not all cleavages occur {{with the same}} efficiency.

25|$|The HIV <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> gp120 induces {{apoptosis}} of neuronal cells by inhibiting {{levels of}} furin and tissue plasminogen activator, enzymes responsible for converting pBDNF to mBDNF. gp120 induces mitochondrial-death proteins like caspases which {{may influence the}} upregulation of the death receptor Fas leading to apoptosis of neuronal cells, gp120 induces oxidative stress in the neuronal cells, {{and it is also}} known to activate STAT1 and induce interleukins IL-6 and IL-8 secretion in neuronal cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{structures}} of human P-TEFb containing Cdk9 and cyclin T1 and the HIV Tat•P-TEFb complex have been solved using X-ray crystallography. The first structure solved {{demonstrated that the}} two subunits were arranged as {{has been found in}} other cyclin dependent kinases. Three amino acid substitutions were inadvertently introduced in the subunits used for the original structure and a subsequent structure determination using the correct sequences demonstrated the same overall structure except for a few significant changes around the active site. The structure of HIV Tat bound to P-TEFb demonstrated that the <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> forms extensive contacts with the cyclin T1 subunit (Figure 2).|$|E
25|$|The single-strand RNA is {{tightly bound}} to p7 nucleocapsid proteins, late {{assembly}} protein p6, and enzymes {{essential to the}} development of the virion, such as reverse transcriptase and integrase. Lysine tRNA is the primer of the magnesium-dependent reverse transcriptase. The nucleocapsid associates with the genomic RNA (one molecule per hexamer) and protects the RNA from digestion by nucleases. Also enclosed within the virion particle are Vif, Vpr, Nef, and viral protease. A matrix composed of an association of the <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> p17 surrounds the capsid, ensuring the integrity of the virion particle. This is in turn surrounded by an envelope of host-cell origin. The envelope is formed when the capsid buds from the host cell, taking some of the host-cell membrane with it. The envelope includes the glycoproteins gp120 and gp41, which are responsible for binding to and entering the host cell.|$|E

25|$|Picornaviruses are non-enveloped, with an {{icosahedral}} capsid. The capsid is {{an arrangement}} of 60 protomers in a tightly packed icosahedral structure. Each protomer consists of 4 polypeptides known as VP (<b>viral</b> <b>protein)</b> 1, 2, 3 and 4. VP2 and VP4 polypeptides originate from one protomer known as VP0 that is cleaved to give the different capsid components. The icosahedral {{is said to have}} a triangulation number of 3, this means that in the icosahedral structure each of the 60 triangles that make up the capsid are split into 3 little triangles with a subunit on the corner.In many picornaviruses have a deep cleft formed by around each of the 12 vertices of icosahedrons.The outer surface of the capsid is composed of regions of VP1, VP2 and VP3. Around each of the vertices is a canyon lined with the C termini of VP1 and VP3. The interior surface of the capsid is composed of VP4 and the N termini of VP1. J.Esposito and Professor Freederick A. Murphy demonstrates cleft structure referred to as canyons, using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy.|$|E
