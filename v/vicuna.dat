5|$|Meanwhile, Ruiz Belvis, {{who headed}} the Committee, was {{supposed}} to gather financial support for the incoming Puerto Rican revolution through a tour of South America. He had received an invitation from Benjamín <b>Vicuña</b> Mackenna, a Chilean diplomat, to coordinate a common front against Spanish interests in all of Latin America (Spain was still threatening Chile after the Chincha Islands War, and any revolution in the Caribbean {{would have been a}} welcome distraction). <b>Vicuña</b> promised to gather necessary support in Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela to help the Puerto Rican independence cause.|$|E
5|$|More {{than ten}} species of mammals have been {{observed}} in the park, several of them endangered, including the colocolo, the Andean mountain cat, the spectacled bear, the taruca deer, the <b>vicuña,</b> the white-tailed deer, the puma, the northern viscacha, the long-tailed weasel, the hog-nosed skunk and the Andean fox.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Peng Cui of the Chinese Academy of Sciences {{and colleagues}} {{carried out a}} phylogenetic study of the {{evolutionary}} relationships between the two tribes of Camelidae; Camelini – consisting of the three Camelus species (the study considered the wild Bactrian camel as a subspecies of the Bactrian camel) – and Lamini, which consists of the alpaca (Vicugna pacos), the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the llama (L. glama) and the <b>vicuña</b> (V. vicugna). The study showed the two tribes had diverged 25 million years ago (early Miocene), earlier than previously estimated from North American fossils.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Vicuñas</b> {{were led}} by Antonio Xeldres. The creole, Mestizo and {{indigenous}} populations largely sided with the <b>Vicuñas.</b> The <b>Vicuñas</b> themselves were not always unified, though, as they suffered from internal feuds between Andalusians {{on one hand and}} New Castillians and Extremadurans on the other (the former group eventually withdrew from the rebellion).|$|R
40|$|<b>Vicuñas</b> (Vicugna vicugna) are South American {{camelids}} whose valuable fleece led {{to their}} overexploitation and near extinction in the 1960 s. Since then, conservation measures enabled the wild population to rebound, and <b>vicuñas</b> are now viewed as strategic resources {{for the development of}} Andean communities. Perceptions of wild <b>vicuñas</b> are changing owed to a transition from strict conservation to managed harvest of fleece from live-shorn animals. Understanding the values and attitudes of human populations toward wildlife is important in the frameworks for developing conservation and sustainable management plans. Attitudes of children are an overlooked area of focus in this field. We surveyed children (n= 348) from four Andean communities of the Puna region in Argentina regarding their perceptions of wild <b>vicuñas</b> and their relationships with domesticated animals. They recognized the potential of wild <b>vicuñas</b> to promote economic development, although they believed that the wild nature of <b>vicuñas</b> made management difficult and not always desirable...|$|R

5|$|San Martín made a {{new request}} for ships to Bowles, but {{received}} no answer. He moved again to Buenos Aires, to make a similar request. He arrived to Mendoza {{a few days after}} the execution of the Chileans Luis and Juan José Carrera, brothers of José Miguel Carrera. The specific initiative of those executions is controversial. Chilean historian <b>Vicuña</b> Mackenna indicts San Martín, while J. C. Raffo de la Reta blames O'Higgins instead. Manuel Rodríguez was also imprisoned and then killed in prison; this death may have been decided by the Lautaro lodge. San Martín could not have taken part in it, as he was already on the way to Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|Official {{efforts to}} protect this area started in 1960, when Senator Augusto Guzmán Robles {{presented}} a bill to the Peruvian Congress {{for the creation of}} Huascarán National Park. In 1963, the Forestry and Hunting Service (Servicio Forestal y de Caza) presented a preliminary project for the delimitation of the Cordillera Blanca National Park, covering an area of 321,000 hectares. On February 18, 1966 a government resolution prohibiting the logging and hunting of native species {{in the area of the}} Cordillera Blanca was issued. Later that year, the Patronage of Huascarán National Park was formed in Yungay. In 1967, Curry Slaymaker and Joel Albrecht, Peace Corps volunteers, formulated delimitation proposal on an area of 85,000 hectares; and simultaneously, the Forest Regional Service of Huaraz established the <b>vicuña</b> and queen-of the-Andes surveillance zone for an area of approximately 10,000 hectares. Finally, on July 1, 1975 Huascarán National Park was created by decree No. 0622-75-AG, with an extension of 340 000 hectares.|$|E

40|$|A current {{programme}} {{of wildlife}} utilisation in the Andean region involves {{the capture of}} wild <b>vicunas,</b> their shearing, transport and, in some cases, captive farming. The effects of these interventions on the physiology, and thus welfare, of wild <b>vicunas</b> are unknown. As a first step to quantifying and thus mitigating any adverse welfare consequences of this harvest, we measured the immediate and longer-term physical and physiological effects of capture, shearing and transport. A sample of juvenile male <b>vicunas</b> was captured. Six were shorn at the capture site, six after two weeks in captivity, and the remaining seven animals were kept as controls for 39 days. In general, <b>vicunas</b> showed changes in blood glucose, packed cell volume, cortisol, and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios within 4 – 6 h following capture. Creatine kinase was also affected by capture and transport, showing a peak plasma level 24 h after capture, which {{was followed by a}} peak plasma level of aspartate aminotransferase four days after capture and transport. After 12 days in captivity, all of the <b>vicunas</b> showed physiological parameters close to expected baseline values for the species. We could detect no differences in physiological parameters between animals that were captured, sheared and transported and those that were only captured and transported. Similarly, we could detect n...|$|R

25|$|The llama and alpaca {{are only}} {{known in the}} {{domestic}} state, and are variable in size and of many colors, being often white, brown, or piebald. Some are grey or black. The guanaco and <b>vicuña</b> are wild, the former being endangered, and of a nearly uniform light-brown color, passing into white below. They certainly differ from each other, the <b>vicuña</b> being smaller, more slender in its proportions, and having a shorter head than the guanaco. The <b>vicuña</b> lives in herds on the bleak and elevated parts of the mountain range bordering the region of perpetual snow, amidst rocks and precipices, occurring in various suitable localities throughout Peru, {{in the southern part}} of Ecuador, and as far south as the middle of Bolivia. Its manners very much resemble those of the chamois of the European Alps; it is as vigilant, wild, and timid. The fiber is extremely delicate and soft, and highly valued for the purposes of weaving, but the quantity that each animal produces is minimal.|$|E

25|$|The Chilean relief {{consists}} of the central depression, which crosses the country longitudinally, flanked by two mountain ranges that make up about 80% of the territory: the Andes mountains to the east-natural border with Bolivia and Argentina, with its most alton 18 located on the Nevado Ojos del Salado, at 6891.3 m, the highest volcano in the world, {{in the region of}} Atacama and Coastal Range west-minor height from the Andes, with its highest point located on the hill <b>Vicuña</b> Mackenna, at 3114 meters, located in the Sierra <b>Vicuña</b> Mackenna, the south of Antofagasta. Among the coastal mountains and the Pacific is a series of coastal plains, of variable length, which allow the settlement of coastal towns and big ports. Some areas of the plains territories encompass territory east of the Andes, and the Patagonian steppes and Magellan, or are high plateaus surrounded by high mountain ranges, such as the Altiplano or Puna de Atacama.|$|E
