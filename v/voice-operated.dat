5000|$|When {{someone on}} a two-way radio wished {{to speak to}} someone on phone, or [...] "landline" [...] (e.g., [...] "Central dispatch, patch me through to McGarrett"), the station {{operator}} at the base would dial the telephone number. When callers {{on the radio and}} on the telephone were both in contact with the base station operator, the handset of the operator's telephone was placed on a cradle built into the Carterfone device. A <b>voice-operated</b> switch in the Carterfone automatically switched on the radio transmitter when the telephone caller was speaking; when he stopped speaking, the radio returned to a receiving condition. A separate speaker was attached to the Carterfone to allow the base station operator to monitor the conversation, adjust the voice volume, and hang up his telephone when the conversation had ended.|$|E
50|$|There were {{communication}} {{problems during}} the spacewalk. Gemini spacecraft {{were the first}} to use a <b>voice-operated</b> switch (known as VOX) on the astronaut's microphones, but McDivitt soon realized his VOX circuit wasn't working properly; he could only hear the Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) in the push-to-talk setting, but not on VOX (though both astronauts could be heard by each other and the ground.) Plus, while outside the spacecraft, White was unable to receive transmissions from the ground and had to have all messages relayed through McDivitt. McDivitt must have switched to the VOX setting somewhere around the time White was exiting the spacecraft, because at that point, for most of the EVA, neither he nor White responded either to the Hawaii CAPCOM, or to the Houston CAPCOM, Gus Grissom. Grissom tried to talk to Gemini 4 a total of 40 times in 13 minutes before he got a response.|$|E
50|$|In this technique, the {{relatively}} slow acting VOX circuitry {{is used to}} control the T/R switches. <b>Voice-operated</b> switch (VOX) circuitry {{is designed to be}} normally activated by human voice audio picked up by the transceiver microphone during voice communications in order to effect antenna change over at a rate no faster than the typical human voice syllabic rate or slower. VOX circuitry usually has a front panel adjustable delay {{that can be used to}} control the length of time it takes for T/R switches to operate but generally the delay adjustment range is limited to that of human voice syllables and, although automatic, is generally not fast enough to act in the short periods between Morse code dots and dashes. Receiving stations thus cannot break-in or interrupt semi break-in or VOX controlled Morse code stations in mid-symbol or mid-word, during Morse code operation because the semi break-in sending station simply cannot hear in the short durations between the Morse code signals and words or code groups.|$|E
50|$|Concerning {{itself with}} Atlantis, it portrays a first person account of Atlantean culture which {{had reached a}} high level of {{technological}} and scientific advancement. His personal history and that of a group of souls with whom Phylos closely interacted is portrayed {{in the context of the}} social, economic, political and religious structures that shaped Poseid society. Daily life for Poseidi citizens included such things as antigravity powered air craft and submarines, television, wireless telephony, arial water generators, air conditioners and high-speed rail. The book deals with deep esoteric subjects including karma and re-incarnation and describes Phylos' final incarnation in 19th century America where his Atlantean karma played itself out. In that incarnation (as Walter Pierson, gold miner and occult student of the Theo-Christic Adepts) he travelled to Venus/Hysperia in a subtle body while his physical form remained at the temple inside Mt Shasta. Describing his experience with the Hesperian adepts, Phylos relates many wonders including artworks depicting 3D scenes that appeared alive. He saw a <b>voice-operated</b> typewriter and other occult and technical power. Some devices mentioned have become reality (such as the TV and the atomic telescope).|$|E
40|$|When users {{interact}} with a <b>voice-operated</b> service, they bring along their habits {{as well as}} their expectations from experience with human-human dialogues, with the domain, and with other systems and services. In addition, users' expectations are further shaped while using a system. The present study explores the extent to which user-system interaction, and in particular difficulties in the interaction, are affected by users' expectations and (mis) conceptions of the service, and how these expectations evolve during use. In an exploratory study, twenty subjects queried two different train travel information services. A semi-structured interview was held on subjects' dialogues with the systems, by replaying the recordings together with the subjects. In interacting with <b>voice-operated</b> services, users appear to draw from various sources of experience.

40|$|Abstract—In amateur radio applications, voice {{activity}} detection (VAD) algorithms enable hands-free, <b>voice-operated</b> transmis-sions (VOX). In this paper, {{we first}} review a recent hybrid VAD algorithm, which was developed by combining features from two legacy speech detection algorithms long used in amateur radio applications. We then propose a novel VAD algorithm whose operating principles are not restricted to those of legacy approaches. The new method employs two key features. The first feature, called sub-band variance ratio, is the ratio of energies calculated over a low-frequency region and {{over the rest of}} the spectrum of the input audio signal. The second feature, called temporal formant density, is a running N-frame sum of the number of low-bandwidth formants over a low-frequency region. Both features are shown to yield low values for non-speech segments and relatively high values for speech segments. A two...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we will {{describe}} {{the design of}} the dialogue management module for a <b>voice-operated</b> system for car driver information. The literature on designing 'good' user interfaces involving natural language dialogue in general and spoken language in particular abounds with useful guidelines for actual development. We have tried to summarize these guidelines in 7 'commandments'. Trying to obey these 7 commandments when designing a system to be used in 'ordinary' situations is by no means easy. To obey them when designing systems for in-car usage is even more difficult: the noisy environment increases the possibility for speech recognition errors, the driver has to perform several other tasks while communicating with the system, etc. In this paper, we will discuss how these constraints influence {{the design of the}} dialogue management module and how the additional requirements fit in with the 7 commandments...|$|E

30|$|Building a <b>voice-operated</b> {{system for}} {{learning}} disabled users {{is a difficult}} task that requires {{a considerable amount of}} time and effort. Due to the wide spectrum of disabilities and their different related phonopathies, most approaches available are targeted to a specific pathology. This may improve their accuracy for some users, but makes them unsuitable for others. In this paper, we present a cross-lingual approach to adapt a general-purpose modular speech recognizer for learning disabled people. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows rapid and cost-effective development by taking the already built speech recognition engine and its modules, and utilizing existing resources for standard speech in different languages for the recognition of the users’ atypical voices. Although the recognizers built with the proposed technique obtain lower accuracy rates than those trained for specific pathologies, they can be used by a wide population and developed more rapidly, which makes it possible to design various types of speech-based applications accessible to learning disabled users.|$|E
