5|$|All 12,400 Chevrolet <b>Volts</b> {{produced}} until December 2011, {{including all}} Amperas in stock at European dealerships, {{were scheduled to}} receive the safety enhancements. Since production was halted during the holidays, the enhancements were in place when production resumed in early 2012. Sales continued, and dealers modified the <b>Volts</b> they had in stock. General Motors {{sent a letter to}} Volt owners indicating that they could schedule the service appointment to protect their batteries beginning in the last week of March 2012. General Motors also decided to replace the 120-volt charging cords in most of the nearly 10,000 <b>Volts</b> sold since late 2010. The new cords were enhanced to add durability, and some of the chargers built after February 5 have the new cords.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 20th century, lithium {{became an}} {{important}} component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential. Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 <b>volts</b> per cell, compared with 2.1 <b>volts</b> for lead-acid or 1.5 <b>volts</b> for zinc-carbon cells. Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a high energy density, {{should not be confused with}} lithium batteries, which are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode. Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.|$|E
5|$|When the {{generator}} building first went into operation, it housed two Westinghouse horizontal generators originally rated at 6,600 <b>volts,</b> operating at 225 rpm and producing 3 phase 60 cycle AC. They were driven by turbines. The voltage was {{stepped up to}} 100,000 <b>volts</b> using three delta-connected oil-cooled transformers of 3,000 kilowatt capacity. These were regulated with oil switches, and the transformers and switch gear were housed in {{the south end of}} {{the generator}} building.|$|E

5000|$|The MAX232 {{replaced}} {{an older}} pair of chips MC1488 and MC1489 that performed similar RS-232 translation. The MC1488 quad transmitter chip required 12 <b>volt</b> and -12 <b>volt</b> power, and MC1489 quad receiver chip required 5 <b>volt</b> power. [...] The main disadvantages of this older solution was the +/- 12 <b>volt</b> power requirement, only supported 5 <b>volt</b> digital logic, and two chips instead of one.|$|R
5|$|Each {{ship had}} seven 1,000 kW ship service turbogenerators (SSTG) {{as well as}} two 200 kW {{emergency}} diesel generators. Total electrical power output was 7,000 kW at 450 <b>volts</b> alternating current.|$|E
5|$|Out of the 2012 production, General Motors {{expected}} to produce 10,000 Amperas for sale in Europe, 6,000 destined for Opel and 4,000 for Vauxhall in the UK. In addition, 2,000 <b>Volts</b> will be made available for the region. By early 2012 GM abandoned its sales target to deliver 45,000 <b>Volts</b> in the U.S and instead announced that production in 2012 will depend on demand. By March 2012 the Volt plant has a global production capacity of 60,000 vehicles per year.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Chevrolet Volt {{was officially}} {{launched}} on November 30, 2010 at a ceremony at the Hamtramck plant, where the first production unit for retail sale came off the assembly line. The first retail vehicle was delivered to a customer in Denville, New Jersey on December 15, 2010. GM reported it had built 12,400 <b>Volts</b> in total through December 2011. This includes dealers' demo vehicles in North America and Amperas in dealerships in Europe, crash test vehicles and other unavailable <b>Volts</b> owned by GM.|$|E
50|$|To {{match the}} 1,200 <b>volt</b> output, the {{locomotive}} would have three 400 <b>volt</b> traction motors connected in series. Later locomotives had two 600 <b>volt</b> motors in series.|$|R
50|$|The LPC1100LV series {{primarily}} targets a low {{operating voltage}} range of 1.65 to 1.95 <b>volt</b> power. Its I²C {{is limited to}} 400 kHz. It is available in two power supply options: A 1.8 <b>volt</b> single power supply (WLCSP25 and HVQFN24 packages), or 1.8 <b>volt</b> (core) / 3.3 <b>volt</b> (IO/analog) dual power supply with 5 <b>volt</b> tolerant I/O (HVQFN33 package). The available packages are WLCSP25 (2.17 mm × 2.32 mm), HVQFN24 and HVQFN33.|$|R

5|$|The Holden Volt is {{available}} to purchase through 49 select Holden dealerships throughout metropolitan and rural Australia, with 18 in Victoria, 11 in New South Wales, 9 in Queensland, 7 in Western Australia and 4 in South Australia. A total of 80 Holden <b>Volts</b> were sold during 2012, and 101 units in 2013. A total of 246 Holden <b>Volts</b> had been sold in the country by mid April 2015, with the stock {{of the first generation}} almost empty. General Motors announced that it will not build the second generation Volt in right-hand-drive configuration, so the Volt will be discontinued in the country when the remaining stock is sold out.|$|E
5|$|Customer {{deliveries}} of the Opel Ampera in Europe were {{delayed until}} the NHTSA completed its {{investigation of the}} Volt's battery fire risk {{to make sure the}} vehicle is safe. However, deliveries of the first Chevrolet <b>Volts</b> in Europe began in France in November 2011. Deliveries of the Vauxhall Ampera in the UK continued as scheduled for May 2012. Opel Ampera deliveries began in February 2012.|$|E
5|$|General Motors do Brasil {{announced}} that it will import from five to ten <b>Volts</b> to Brazil during the first semester of 2011 as part of a demonstration and also to lobby the federal government to enact financial incentives for green cars. If successful, General Motors would adapt the Volt to operate on ethanol fuel, as most new Brazilian cars are flex-fuel.|$|E

5|$|In March 2012, General Motors {{announced}} that an agreement was {{signed with the}} China Automotive Technology and Research Center (CATARC) to manage the Volt demonstration fleet in Beijing and to gather feedback from the fleet usage for one year. The demonstration <b>Volts</b> were scheduled to be delivered in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|Magicam also {{produced}} the orbital dry dock seen during the Enterprises {{first appearance in}} the film. Measuring 4ft x 10ft x 6ft (1.22m x 3.05m x 1.83m), its 56 neon panels required 168,000 <b>volts</b> of electricity to operate, with a separate table to support the transformers; the final price for the dock setup was $200,000.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{video signal}} (or more precisely composite video signal) is a signal {{with a maximum}} level of 1 <b>volt</b> into 75 Ω. In this signal 0.3 <b>volt</b> corresponds to black and 1 <b>volt</b> corresponds to white. The 0.0 <b>volt</b> to 0.3 <b>volt</b> range is reserved for the sync pulses. Video circuits are designed around these limits. These limits apply to recording on analogue video tape and analogue transmission {{as well as in}} analogue to digital video converters.|$|R

5|$|In 1914, Franck {{teamed up}} with Hertz to perform an {{experiment}} to investigate fluorescence. They designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapour of mercury atoms. They discovered that when an electron collided with a mercury atom it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9electron <b>volts)</b> of its kinetic energy before flying away. A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely {{the same amount of}} its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, General Motors planned {{an initial}} {{production}} for calendar year 2011 of 10,000 <b>Volts</b> and 45,000 units for 2012, {{up from the}} 30,000 units initially announced. In May 2011, the carmaker again raised its production targets, as Volt and Ampera production capacity was increased to 16,000 units in 2011, including 3,500 units for exports and 2,500 demonstration units destined to U.S. dealerships, and the rest for U.S. sales. However, in November 2011 GM's sales chief announced {{that they would not}} meet its sales goal of 10,000 vehicles in 2011.|$|E
