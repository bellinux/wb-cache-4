40|$|To {{determine}} whether antidopaminergic drug administration may modify endogenous opioid {{activity at the}} hypothalamic-pituitary level, the effects of naloxone infusion (1. 6 mg/h for 4 h) on LH secretion were studied in six postmenopausal women before and after administration of the potent antidopaminergic drug <b>veralipride</b> for 20 days. Before <b>veralipride</b> administration, the naloxone infusion did not alter LH secretion. Chronic administration of <b>veralipride</b> resulted in a significant (P less than 0. 01) decline in plasma LH levels. In addition, the naloxone infusion induced a significant (P less than 0. 05) increase in plasma LH levels, which reached values similar to those before <b>veralipride</b> administration. These results demonstrate that in postmenopausal women the antidopaminergic drug <b>veralipride</b> can restore, at least in part, {{the activity of the}} endogenous opioid system. These findings suggest that endogenous opioid peptides may mediate the inhibitory effect exerted by chronic antidopaminergic drug administration on LH secretion in humans...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of endogenous opioid peptides on body thermoregulation {{has been studied}} in untreated postmenopausal women {{and in the same}} subjects after chronic administration of the antidopaminergic drug <b>veralipride</b> (200 mg/day for 20 days). Subjects randomly received an infusion of the opioid antagonist naloxone (1. 6 mg/h for 4 h) or saline on two consecutive days, both before and after <b>veralipride</b> treatment. In untreated subjects body core temperature, as evaluated by rectal temperature, did not vary during saline infusion, whereas a significant decrease was observed during naloxone infusion. Chronic administration of <b>veralipride</b> significantly increased the hypothermic response to naloxone. Therefore, <b>veralipride</b> seems to increase the activity of endogenous opioid peptides on mechanisms which regulate body temperature in postmenopausal women...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects on}} hot flushes of the {{dopamine}} antagonist <b>Veralipride</b> versus placebo were investigated in a randomized double-blind study of postmenopausal healthy women (N = 20 in each group). Cutaneous temperature recording and plasma LH pulsatility were studied in eight patients from each group. <b>Veralipride</b> administration (100 mg/day for 30 days) induced a significant (P less than. 01) reduction in vasomotor symptoms and {{was more effective}} (P less than. 05) than placebo.

A significant reduction (P less than. 01) was observed in objectively recorded hot flushes after <b>Veralipride</b> treatment, whereas there was no significant change in the characteristics of LH pulsatility. Infusion of the opioid antagonist naloxone (N = 5) induced a significant (P less than. 01) increase in LH secretion after <b>Veralipride</b> administration.

40|$|Patterns of LH and PRL {{secretion}} {{have been}} evaluated in 15 postmenopausal women {{before and after the}} chronic blockage of the D 2 dopamine receptors with <b>veralipride</b> (100 mg twice daily, for 30 days). In addition, the possible influence of the antidopaminergic drug on the activity of the endogenous opioid system has been evaluated by the infusion of the opioid antagonist naloxone, performed before and during <b>veralipride</b> administration. Mean plasma LH levels were significantly blunted (p less than 0. 05) and mean plasma PRL levels were significantly increased (p less than 0. 001) by <b>veralipride</b> administration. The frequency of both LH and PRL secretory pulses was not modified, while the mean pulse amplitude of both hormones was significantly increased (p less than 0. 05 for LH; p less than 0. 001 for PRL) by <b>veralipride</b> administration. In untreated postmenopausal women naloxone infusion did not modify LH secretion. Following <b>veralipride,</b> the infusion of naloxone significantly increased (p less than 0. 05) the mean plasma LH levels, had no influence on the frequency and significantly reduced (p less than 0. 01) the amplitude of LH pulses, expressed as the percent increase from the nadir to the peak. Both before and after <b>veralipride</b> administration, naloxone failed to modify the pattern of PRL secretion. In untreated postmenopausal women, the percentage of concomitant PRL and LH pulses was significantly higher (p less than 0. 001) during naloxone than during saline infusion, and this effect was amplified by <b>veralipride</b> administration (p less than 0. 01).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{pathogenesis}} of {{hot flushes}} involves several brain neurotransmitter systems, {{and changes in}} serotonin turnover have been hypothesized. <b>Veralipride</b> is an anti-dopaminergic agent that relieves hot flushes and putatively also modulates serotonergic neurons. To further elucidate this relationship, {{in the present study}} we evaluated whether administration of <b>veralipride</b> for relief of hot flushes is able to affect serum levels of the serotonin precursor tryptophan in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Twenty-four postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to receive <b>veralipride</b> (100 mg/day) or similar placebo tablets for 3 months (n = 12 per group). Free tryptophan and total tryptophan (free + protein-bound) levels were assayed before and monthly by high pressure liquid chromatography. Data were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test. RESULTS: Relief of hot-flushes was achieved with complete suppression of symptoms after <b>veralipride,</b> but not placebo, treatment. In the <b>veralipride</b> group, total tryptophan levels significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased from baseline (11. 2 +/- 0. 4 microg/ml) to 3 months (8. 0 +/- 0. 3 microg/ml), as well as free tryptophan concentrations (baseline 2. 1 +/- 0. 1 microg/ml; after 3 months 1. 3 +/- 0. 1 microg/ml; p < 0. 05). No changes were recorded in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Women treated with <b>veralipride</b> for relief of menopausal symptoms show a decrease in serum levels of serotonin precursors, suggesting that the brain serotonergic system may be involved in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms...|$|E
40|$|The perimenopausal period, from 1 to 4 years, is characterised by vasomotor symptoms, or hot flushes, {{and other}} effects due {{a deficit of}} estrogens. Approximately 85 % of women have hot flushes for 1 year and 25 - 50 % {{continue}} for up to 5 years. The cause of hot flushes {{has been linked to}} dysfunction of the thermoregulatory centre caused by estrogen withdrawal. One proposal for the aetiology of hot flushes is that the thermoregulatory zone is shifted downward in patients who experience hot flushes. Estrogen withdrawal creates a change of the central opioid system and a thermoregulatory instability. Estrogen and/or progestin replacement is the treatment of choice for this distressing symptom. However, steroid replacement may be associated with risks and complications, and is limited in some subjects by well-known contraindications. <b>Veralipride,</b> a synthetic benzamide derivative with antidopaminergic action, is effective in reducing the frequency and severity of hot flushes associated with menopausal hypoestrogenism, gaining interest as a non-hormonal treatment for climacteric flushing. In recent years, extrapyramidal disorders associated with <b>veralipride</b> therapy have been reported and are often due to drug misuse. Adverse effects include acute dyskinesia or Parkinsonism, which may occur after many months of treatment. An association between adverse effects and mistake of administration has been described.

For the treatment of hot flush, several non-hormonal treatments exist; among them, <b>veralipride</b> has shown to be a useful treatment of vasomotor symptoms during the climacteric period. In recent times, several medical societies have discredited its use. The purpose of this review, therefore, is to define a measured position in relation to the use of this drug. On completion of this review, it was possible to conclude that this drug has an antidopaminergic mechanism of action. The recommended schedule is: 100 mg/day for 20 days, with 10 days drug free. Since the risk of undesirable secondary effects such as galactorrhea, mastodynia, and extrapyramidal can increase with use, no more than 3 treatment cycles are recommended.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the utility of a parametric deconvolution method using a sum of inverse Gaussian functions (IG) to characterize the absorption and concentrations vs. time profile of drugs exhibiting complex absorption. METHODS: For a linear time-invariant system the response, Y(t), following an arbitrary input function I(t), is the convolution of I(t) with the disposition function, H(t), of the system: [Formula: see text]. The method proposed uses a sum of n inverse Gaussian functions to characterize I(t). The approach was compared with a standard nonparametric method using linear splines. Data were provided from previously published studies on two drugs (hydromorphone and <b>veralipride)</b> showing complex absorption and analyzed with NONMEM. RESULTS: A satisfactory fit for hydromorphone and <b>veralipride</b> data following oral administration was achieved by fitting a sum of two or three IG functions. The predictions of the input functions were very similar to those using linear splines. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a sum of IG as opposed to nonparametric functions, such as splines, offers a simpler implementation, a more intuitive interpretation of the results, a built-in extrapolation, and an easier implementation in a population context. Disadvantages are an apparent greater sensitivity to initial value estimates (when used with NONMEM) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the administration of}} raloxifene and <b>veralipride</b> in postmenopausal women with high osteoporosis risk and hot flushes in whom hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was contraindicated. A group of early postmenopausal women (n = 29) (mean age 51. 8 +/- 4. 1), complaining of severe vasomotor symptoms and with a bone mineral density (BMD) T-score between - 1. 5 and - 2. 5 were evaluated. They {{were randomly assigned to}} two treatment groups: raloxfene (60 mg/day) continuously in association with <b>veralipride</b> (100 mg/day) on alternate days (n = 17); or on alternate months (n = 12). BMD, serum prolactin concentration and endometrial thickness were assessed at baseline and after 6 months of therapy. Kupperman Index and hot flushes were assessed before and after 3 and 6 months of therapy. BMD was significantly higher at the end of therapy with an increase of 1. 1 %. Kupperman Index was significantly reduced after 3 months and a further decrease at 6 months was observed with both protocols. Both treatments led to a significant reduction of hot flushes after 3 and 6 months. No signifcant changes of prolactin levels were observed in either protocol. We found that the combined raloxifene-veralipride treatment, both every other day and every other month, led to a significant improvement in bone density and was effective in hot flushes and other menopause-associated symptoms. These protocols could represent a new way to administer raloxifene in early postmenopausal women at high osteoporosis risk with HRT contraindicatio...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods of}} {{modelling}} the Double Peak Phenomenon in pharmacokinetics are described; both {{are based on}} compartmental models. The first method assumes that the absorption of the drug from the gut to the systemic plasma varies with {{the location of the}} drug in the gut, with negligible absorption through the jejunum. It has the advantage of clear physiological interpretation, but there are a comparatively large number of parameters to be estimated. The second method assumes simultaneous input via two parallel pathways, and has been developed with the aim of reducing the number of parameters in the model. However, this approach lacks the direct relationship to physiology. The two methods are used to model two data sets provided by AstraZeneca and a further data set from the literature, describing the pharmacokinetics of <b>veralipride.</b> For all three data sets, the measurement is of concentration of drug in the systemic plasma following oral administration in solution form...|$|E
40|$|The dopaminergic system {{seems to}} be {{involved}} in both pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion and hot flushes in post-menopausal women. With the aim of further clarifying its role, the effectiveness of dopaminergic and antidopaminergic drugs in the treatment of hot flushes was studied. Self-assessed scores for vasomotor symptoms were evaluated in 5 groups of 15 patients treated for 20 days with one of the following agents: placebo; the dopamine receptor agonist, bromocriptine; the indirect dopaminergic agent, Liposom; the antidopaminergic drug, <b>veralipride</b> or the peripheral antidopaminergic agent, domperidone. All of these treatment regimens were effective in alleviating hot flushes, but the pharmacological agents proved to be more effective than the placebo. A direct dopaminergic action is hypothesized in the case of bromocriptine and Liposom, while the antidopaminergic drugs might act through different indirect mechanisms such as the short-loop feedback exerted by hyperprolactinaemia on tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons with a secondary dopamine-like activity, or stimulation of the opioid system...|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above (Berendsen 2000; Rosenberg & Larsen 1991), {{it is thought}} that α-adrenergic mechanisms participate in the pathophysiology of HF. And {{as is often the case}} in medicine, anecdotal reports pique interest in the testing of a specific drug for a new indication. In this instance, hypertensive women being treated with methyldopa, an α-adrenergic, centrally-active sympatholytic, reported improvement in HF symptoms. In two randomised, placebo-controlled trials each lasting 4 weeks and involving 40 post-menopausal women each, respectively (Nesheim & Saetre 1981; Andersen et al. 1986), significant improvement in HF symptoms was reported. Another study expounded on this and compared the following: bromocriptine (dopaminergic), liposom (indirect dopaminergic), <b>veralipride</b> (antidopaminergic), domperidone (a peripheral antidopaminergic) and placebo for treating vasomotor symptoms of menopause (Zichella et al. 1986). As all active treatments proved effective, different pathways were postulated: A direct action would be expected from dopamine, and direct and indirect dopaminergic agents, while the antidopaminergic drugs are thought to evoke a secondary dopamine-like activity via the short-loop feedback exerted by hyperprolactinaemia on tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons, or perhaps stimulation of the opioid system (Zichella et al. 1986). Though improvement in HF was seen, concerns about side effects (depression, anxiety, decreased alertness, lethargy, dizziness, headaches, myalgia, etc.) led to other avenues being pursued.|$|E
40|$|Background Antipsychotic {{agents are}} often used to treat neuropsychiatric {{symptoms}} (NPS) in dementia, although the literature is sceptical about their long-termuse for this indication. Their effectiveness is limited and there is concern about adverse effects, including higher mortality with long-term use. When behavioural strategies have failed and drug therapy is instituted, regular attempts to withdraw these drugs are recommended. Physicians, nurses and families of older people with dementia are often reluctant {{to try to stop}} antipsychotics, fearing deterioration of NPS. Strategies to reduce antipsychotic use have been proposed, but a systematic review of interventions aimed at withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia has not yet been performed. Objectives : To evaluate whether withdrawal of antipsychotic agents is successful in older people with dementia in community or nursing home settings, to list the different strategies for withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia and NPS, and to measure the effects of withdrawal of antipsychotic agents on behaviour. Search methods : ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources were searched on 23 November 2012. The search included the following terms: antipsychotic* or neuroleptic* or phenothiazines or butyrophenones or risperidone or olanzapine or haloperidol or prothipendyl or methotrimeprazine or clopenthixol or flupenthixol or clothiapine or metylperon or droperidol or pipamperone or benperidol or bromperidol or fluspirilene or pimozide or penfluridol or sulpiride or <b>veralipride</b> or levosulpiride or sultopride or aripiprazole or clozapine or quetiapine or thioridazine combined wither terms such as discontinu* or withdraw* or cessat* or reduce* or reducing or reduct* or taper* or stop*. ALOIS contains records from all major healthcare databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. Selection criteria : Randomised, placebo-controlled trials comparing an antipsychotic withdrawal strategy to continuation of antipsychotics in people with dementia. Data collection and analysis : Review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, rated their risk of bias and extracted data. Main results : We included nine trials with 606 randomised participants. Seven trials were conducted in nursing homes, one trial in an outpatient setting and one in both settings. In these trials, different types of antipsychotics prescribed at different doses were withdrawn. Both abrupt and gradual withdrawal schedules were used. The risk of bias of the included studies was generally low regarding blinding and outcome reporting and unclear for randomisation procedures and recruitment of participants. There was a wide variety of outcome measures. Our primary efficacy outcomes were success of withdrawal (i. e. remaining in study off antipsychotics) and NPS. Eight of nine trials reported no overall significant difference between groups on the primary outcomes, although in one pilot study of people with psychosis and agitation that had responded to haloperidol, time to relapse was significantly shorter in the discontinuation group (Chi(2) = 4. 1, P value = 0. 04). The ninth trial included people with psychosis or agitation who had responded well to risperidone therapy for four to eight months and reported that discontinuation led to an increased risk of relapse, that is, increase in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) -core score of 30 % or greater (P value = 0. 004, hazard ratio (HR) 1. 94, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 09 to 3. 45 at four months). The only outcome that could be pooled was the full NPI-score, used in two studies. For this outcome {{there was no significant difference}} between people withdrawn from and those continuing on antipsychotics at three months (mean difference (MD) - 1. 49, 95 % CI - 5. 39 to 2. 40). These two studies reported subgroup analyses according to baseline NPI-score (14 or less versus > 14). In one study, those with milder symptoms at baseline were significantly less agitated at three months in the discontinuation group (NPI-agitation, Mann-Whitney U test z = 2. 4, P value = 0. 018). In both studies, there was evidence of significant behavioural deterioration in people with more severe baseline NPS who were withdrawn from antipsychotics (Chi(2) = 6. 8; P value = 0. 009 for the marked symptom score in one study). Individual studies did not report significant differences between groups on any other outcome except one trial that found a significant difference in a measure of verbal fluency, favouring discontinuation. Most trials lacked power to detect clinically important differences between groups. Adverse events were not systematically assessed. In one trial there was a non-significant increase in mortality in people who continued antipsychotic treatment (5 % to 8 % greater than placebo, depending on the population analysed, measured at 12 months). This trend became significant three years after randomisation, but due to dropout and uncertainty about the use of antipsychotics in this follow-up period this result should be interpreted with caution. Authors' conclusions : Our findings suggest that many older people with Alzheimer's dementia and NPS can be withdrawn from chronic antipsychotic medication without detrimental effects on their behaviour. It remains uncertain whether withdrawal is beneficial for cognition or psychomotor status, but the results of this review suggest that discontinuation programmes could be incorporated into routine practice. However, two studies of people whose agitation or psychosis had previously responded well to antipsychotic treatment found an increased risk of relapse or shorter time to relapse after discontinuation. Two other studies suggest that people with more severe NPS at baseline could benefit from continuing their antipsychotic medication. In these people, withdrawal might not be recommended...|$|E
