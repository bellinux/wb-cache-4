5|$|Federal {{examiners}} had {{the authority}} to register voters, examine <b>voter</b> registration applications, and maintain <b>voter</b> rolls. The goal of the federal examiner provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities the right to vote by engaging in discriminatory behavior in the <b>voter</b> registration process, such as refusing to register qualified applicants, purging qualified voters from the <b>voter</b> rolls, and limiting the hours during which persons could register. Federal examiners were used extensively in the years following the Act's enactment, but their importance waned over time; 1983 was the last year that a federal examiner registered a person to vote. In 2006, Congress repealed the provision.|$|E
