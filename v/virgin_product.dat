Nevertheless, research finds that consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for refurbished products is low. Strategies for a higher WTP are {{needed in order to}} grow consumer markets for refurbished products. Eco-certification of refurbished products may be a key strategy here. Drawing on the consumer WTP literature concerning “green” products, we investigate the impact of independent eco-certificates. Our analysis is based on a survey of 231 potential customers. The results suggest that, across various product categories, the WTP for products with refurbished components is significantly lower. Adding an eco-certificate tends to return the WTP toward the <b>virgin</b> <b>product</b> level. We show that consumers with proenvironmental attitudes particularly exhibit green buying behavior. Our findings indicate that eco-certification is often worthwhile because it enhances the business rationale for producing products with refurbished component...|$|E

One aspect of arranger liability that has undergone radical change in the past decade is the useful product doctrine, which allows a party to escape arranger liability by proving it was selling a useful product rather than arranging for disposal. Prior to Burlington Northern, courts applied the useful product doctrine restrictively, only allowing parties selling <b>virgin</b> <b>products</b> to escape liability and imposing liability on parties selling useful secondary products. Following Burlington Northern, this shifted, with courts requiring concrete evidence of intent in arrangements for disposal and allowing parties selling secondary products to escape liability even when their actions directly contributed to environmental contamination.

40|$|International audienceThe Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing {{residual}} materials as a result of huge production of the Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE), its market expansion and technological progress in its conception. The complex compositions of WEEE (precious, strategic and rare elements, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, plastics, hazardous substances [...] .) and its often miniature design lead to the technical and environmental difficulties to propose an efficient and viable flow-sheet for WEEE treatment and for the recovery process. In this context, this study deals with delivering a predictive simulation tool (simulator) for the WEEE physical treatment (size reduction and sorting) useful for coherent matter balance calculation. Calculated material flows are then available for further environmental assessment. The simulator approach is based on combining the flow-sheets, the phase model, the mathematical models and a set of algorithms to get a representation of a given situation in terms of material flows circulating between processes. Data optimization and assessment of the simulator output led to the establishment of an enhanced and innovative process for the WEEE processing. Further, this study provides a methodology to assess the impact of the implementation of a WEEE recycling technology that takes into account economic, social and environmental consequences. Results linked to the chosen examples for aluminum and ABS plastic recycling from WEEE by the established process and their use instead of <b>virgin</b> <b>products</b> showed an important profit for these recycled materials from economic and environmental points of view.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Millions {{of dollars}} of limited state cleanup funds are spent each year in New Hampshire to identify, sample, excavate, and treat {{thousands}} of tons of contaminated soil. Cost analyses of numerous sites indicated that soil remediation costs alone reach upwards of $ 300, 000. 00 per site. The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services “Interim Policy for Management of Soils Contaminated from Spills/Releases of <b>Virgin</b> Petroleum <b>Products</b> ” (DES, 1989, 1991) set conservative remediation goals based on total petroleum hydrocarbons in 1989 using the Leaching Potential Analysis method (California Luft Manual, 1989). A current review of available literature and several case histories indicated that chemical-specific soil cleanup levels may be more appropriate for establishing remedial goals. New chemical-specific soil cleanup guidelines using a risk-based approach have been developed. These new guidelines are conservatively based using two principal considerations: (1) an assumed soil exposure scenario that estimated the human health risks associated with potential long-term exposure to site soils via ingestion, inhalation and dermal contact and (2) the estimated fate and transport of chemicals of concern in the soil unsaturated zone.

40|$|The {{substantial}} {{growth in}} infrastructure developments {{has resulted in}} an increase in the quantity of Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste, and the need to find effective waste management options. Although recycling C&D waste is becoming the preferred option for maintaining sustainable waste management practices, the adoption of recycling within the building industry is still very slow, with some C&D waste material still going to landfill. There are many drivers and barriers to the effective recycling and use of C&D waste materials. As many C&D companies strive to be considered as having sustainable practices, it has become necessary to overcome the existing barriers, as the demand for C&D recycled materials remains low. This study investigated the recycling of Reinforced Concrete (RC) and brick waste materials as a substitute for virgin gravel, compared to landfill disposal. Case-studies from six construction sites and a recycling plant were analysed, using the Triple Bottom Line + 1 (TBL+ 1) concept to discuss the environmental, social, economic, and governance impacts. The methods of data analysis applied were &# 8216;End-of-Life-Cycle Assessment&# 8217; (ELCA), &# 8216;investigating construction site practices&# 8217;, &# 8216;End-of-Life-Cycle Cost&# 8217; (ELCC), and &# 8216;review of waste legislation&# 8217;. Environmentally, four impact categories were considered for the ELCA study, namely, global warming (CO 2), water use, solid waste and embodied energy. The recycling results indicated that benefits of not producing virgin gravel or steel were significant in reducing the overall environmental impact, especially in energy and transport use. However, sustainable fuel options for transport and energy could further improve the environmental recycling benefits realised. The environmental impact of recycling RC and bricks was comparatively lower than landfill disposal. Socially, the study of the six construction sites highlighted best practices, and some barriers to recycling that had been gradually adopted at construction sites. The study findings indicated that the potential to recycle relied on effective waste management practices at C&D sites, and hence there was the need for a broader application of waste management practices across the building industry. Economically, ELCC calculations revealed cheaper RC and brick recycling costs compared to landfill disposal and virgin gravel production, when avoided production of steel and virgin gravel were considered. Conclusions from the cost calculations indicated that fuel tax costs and sustainable cheaper fuel options could further reduce recycling cost. However, to effectively maintain demand for recycled RC and brick materials, the introduction of higher landfill fees, taxes on <b>virgin</b> <b>products,</b> and subsidies for recycled products such as RC and bricks, is required. The governance aspect of the study reviewed seven organisational contributions to waste legislation. The review revealed that although there were several environmentally certified recycled materials on the market, the majority of them were not C&D recycled materials. The review of legislation highlighted the need to promote the endorsement of C&D recycled materials, as a critical step to the improvement of product quality, and increased demand. The overall results indicated that the optimisation of demand for recycled C&D waste materials could not be solely improved by considering environmental impacts. The social, economic, and governance impacts were very important aspects to consider. This study successfully addressed the interrelated factors needed to improve current recycling practices, with recommendations to increase demand for C&D recycled products such as RC and bricks...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{complete}} {{review of}} the different techniques {{that have been developed}} to recycle fibre reinforced polymers is presented. The review also focuses on the reuse of valuable products recovered by different techniques, in particular the way that fibres have been reincorporated into new materials or applications and the main technological issues encountered. Recycled glass fibres can replace small amounts of <b>virgin</b> fibres in <b>products</b> but not at high enough concentrations to make their recycling economically and environmentally viable, if for example, thermolysis or solvolysis is used. Reclaimed carbon fibres from high-technology applications cannot be reincorporated in the same applications from which they were recovered, so new appropriate applications have to be developed in order to reuse the fibres. Materials incorporating recycled fibres exhibit specific mechanical properties because of the particular characteristics imparted by the fibres. The development of specific standards is therefore necessary, as well as efforts in the development of solutions that enable reusers to benefit from their reinforcement potential. The recovery and reuse of valuable products from resins are also considered, but also the development of recyclable thermoset resins. Finally, the economic and environmental aspects of recycling composite materials, based on Life Cycle Assessment, are discussed...|$|R

Reprocessing is also uneconomical {{in comparison to the}} <b>virgin</b> plastic <b>products</b> in terms of commercial values due to polymeric contamination. This article studies the thermo-catalytic conversion processes waste plastics. The reaction conditions and the quantification of types of catalysts used for the conversion processes influenced the quality of the resultant hydrocarbons. Obtaining higher yield of conversion and transport grade fuel require more investigation to adapt this technical process as one of the effective alternative resources for fuel production. Thermo-catalytic process resolves the problem of halogen contents in the PVC type plastics by converting them into residues with the use of NaHCO 3 and AgNO 3 which capture chlorine type products from the gaseous hydrocarbons. Addition of catalysts in the convenient reactor reduces the requirement of higher temperature operations like thermal cracking processes and produces more liquefied products. It has been observed that, the aromatic plastic contents should be observed during the conversion process to obtain fuels based on allowable aromatic contents according to the fuel standards and emission regulations implemented in respective regions. The temperature of the process need to be controlled as per the boiling points of the mixture contents to avoid formation of vapor in the reactor which could causes sticky adherence to the reactor walls. A continuous liquid fractionating distillation process can reduce the formation of light gases in the yield. It was also found that the mixture of LDPE, HDPE, PP and PS yield 87. 19 % fuel with 20 wt% ZnO catalyst at 200 – 400 °C in a steel reactor. These fuels can be used directly in the automotive engines or can be retreated in the refineries to divide into gasoline and diesel fuels as per carbon chains. Since the plastic feedstocks do not contain any sulfur components the produced fuel can be treated as clean enough. Thus the fuels produced from this process can be considered as one of the potential alternative resources of fuel production resulting into an effective reduction of plastic wastes in a country...|$|R

Laboratory evaluation was undertaken on the RCA/FRG blends with 10 %, 20 % and 30 % FRG content and stabilized with 3 % medium setting General Blend (GB) cement. The laboratory evaluation was comprised of pH, plasticity index, foreign materials content, particle size distribution, linear shrinkage, California Bearing Ratio, modified Proctor compaction, Repeated Load Triaxial test, Unconfined Compressive Strength test and flexural beam tests. The cement stabilized RCA/FRG blends with up to 30 % FRG content were found to have physical properties, which comply with the local state road authority requirements.

40|$|Waste plastic {{disposal}} {{and excessive}} use of fossil fuels have caused environment concerns in the world. Both plastics and petroleum derived fuels are hydrocarbons that contain the elements of carbon and hydrogen. The difference between them is that plastic molecules have longer carbon chains than those in LPG, petrol, and diesel fuels. Therefore, {{it is possible to}} convert waste plastic into fuels. The main objectives of this study were to understand and optimize the processes of plastic pyrolysis for maximizing the diesel range products, and to design a continuous pyrolysis apparatus as a semi-scale commercial plant. Pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS) has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally in a lab-scale pyrolysis reactor. The key factors have been investigated and identified. The cracking temperature for PE and PP in the pyrolysis is at 450 ºC, but that of PS is lower, at 320 ºC. High reaction temperature and heating rate can significantly promote the production of light hydrocarbons. Long residence time also favours the yield of the light hydrocarbon products. The effects of other factors like type of reactor, catalyst, pressure and reflux rate have also been investigated in the literature review. From the literature review, the pyrolysis reaction consists of three progressive steps: initiation, propagation, and termination. Initiation reaction cracks the large polymer molecules into free radicals. The free radicals and the molecular species can be further cracked into smaller radicals and molecules during the propagation reactions. β-scission is the dominant reaction in the PE propagation reactions. At last, the radicals will combine together into stable molecules, which are termination reactions. There are three types of cracking of the polymers: random cracking, chain strip cracking, and end chain cracking. The major cracking on the polymer molecular backbone is random cracking. Some cracking occurs at the ends of the molecules or the free radicals, which is end chain cracking. Some polymers have reactive functional side group on their molecular backbones. The functional groups will break off the backbone, which is chain strip cracking. Chain strip cracking is the dominant cracking reaction during polystyrene pyrolysis. The reaction kinetics was investigated in this study. The activation energy and the energy requirement for the pyrolysis are dependent on the reaction process and the distribution of the final products. Following the equations from other literatures, the theoretical energy requirement for pyrolyze 1 kg PE is 1. 047 MJ. The estimated calorific value of the products is about 43. 3 MJ/kg. Therefore, the energy profit is very high for this process. The PE pyrolysis products are mainly 1 -alkenes, n-alkanes, and α, ω-dialkenes ranging from C 1 to C 45 +. The 1 -alkenes and the n-alkanes were identified with a special method developed in this research. It was found that secondary cracking process has a significant influence on the distribution of the product. This process converts heavy hydrocarbons into gas or light liquid product and significantly reduces 1 -alkenes and α, ω-dialkenes. This secondary process can be controlled by adjusting the reflux rate of the primary product. The product of PE pyrolysis with maximized diesel range output consist of 18. 3 % non-condensable gases, 81. 7 % w/w liquid product, and less than 1 % pure carbon under high reflux rate process. Some zeolite catalysts were tested to reduce the heavy molecular weight wax. It was found that NKC- 5 (ZSM- 5) was the most effective catalyst among zeolites tested. The proportion of the non-condensable gases was promoted from 17 % w/w to 58 % w/w by adding 10 % w/w NKC- 5 into the PE feedstock. The products of PP pyrolysis are mainly methyl- oligomers. The reflux effect on the product from pyrolysis of PP is not as great as that on PE. The PP pyrolysis product with high reflux rate consists of 15. 7 % non-condensable gases, 84. 2 % condensed liquid product, and less than 0. 25 % char. Cyclohexane is the dominant component, 21 %w/w in the liquid product. 44 %v/v of the non-condensable gases is propene. In the pyrolysis product of PS, there are 4 % non-condensable gases, 93 % liquid, and 3 % char. Styrene accounts for 68. 59 %w/w in the PS liquid pyrolysis products due to the chain strip reactions. There was 19 % v/v hydrogen in the gas product, which did not exist in the PE pyrolysis gas product. The composition of the char is almost pure carbon, which is similar to that from PE pyrolysis. The mixture of virgin and post-consumer PE, PP and PS have also been investigated to identify the feedstock interaction and the effect of the contamination on the product. The interaction promotes the production of non-condensable gases. However, the effect of the interaction on the distribution of total product is not significant. Contamination of paper labels on the post-consumer plastics may result in higher solid residue in the product but no significant effect on the product was found in this study. Based on the achievements, a continuous semi-scale reactor has been designed and constructed at maximum capacity of 27. 11 kg/hr in this research. From the experiments of pyrolysis of both virgin PE and post-consumer PE on this semi-scale pyrolysis reactor, {{it was found that the}} major components are 1 -alkenes, n-alkanes, and α, ω- dialkenes. The distribution of the condensed products of PE pyrolysis from the semiscale reactor is the same as that of the products from low reflux rate process with the lab-scale reactor. However, the proportion of non-condensable gases is much higher than that from pyrolysis in the lab-scale tests with low reflux rate because the semiscale plant has higher reaction temperature and heating rate. Lower proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbons was found in the condensed product from the post-consumer PE pyrolysis than in the <b>virgin</b> PE <b>product</b> because of the contamination on the postconsumer PE. The actual energy consumption for cracking and vaporizing PE into fuels is 1. 328 MJ/kg which is less than 3 % of the calorific value of the pyrolysis products. Therefore, the pyrolysis technology has very high energy profit, 42. 3 MJ/kg PE, and is environmental-friendly. The oil produced has very high quality and close to the commercial petroleum derived liquid fuels. The experience of design and operation of the semi-scale plant will be helpful for building a commercial scale plant in the future...|$|R
