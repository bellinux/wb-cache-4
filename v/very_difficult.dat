5|$|An oil tanker's {{inert gas}} system {{is one of}} the most {{important}} parts of its design. Fuel oil itself is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to ignite, but its hydrocarbon vapors are explosive when mixed with air in certain concentrations. The purpose of the system is to create an atmosphere inside tanks in which the hydrocarbon oil vapors cannot burn.|$|E
5|$|Barium is a soft, silvery-white metal, with {{a slight}} golden shade when ultrapure. The silvery-white color of barium metal rapidly vanishes upon {{oxidation}} in air yielding a dark gray oxide layer. Barium has a medium specific weight and good electrical conductivity. Ultrapure barium is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to prepare, and therefore many properties of barium have not been accurately measured yet.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} balance issues, {{the game was}} initially <b>very</b> <b>difficult,</b> especially in the later stages. Nakamura had written a program that simulated every single combat {{that he used to}} adjust the games setting for character leveling and the strength of enemies players would encounter. This program failed to account for larger monster groups, however, which fell outside the model and caused the game to be <b>very</b> <b>difficult.</b> Further more, enemies leveling and weapons power were designed by area, but Koichi Nakamura didn't think over the boat, so if player get the boat to some land might be quickly killed. The developers realized there was a balance problem and did some modifications, such as limiting the number of enemies in Midenhall to groups of three, and moving the Cannock Castle closer to Midenhall Castle.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of his}} career, Fischer was {{predictable}} in his use of openings {{and variations}} of those openings. Despite this seeming disadvantage, it was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> for opponents to exploit this limitation, because Fischer's knowledge of the openings and variations that he used was extensive.|$|E
5|$|Found {{with almost}} all other rare-earth metals but never by itself, {{lutetium}} is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to separate from}} other elements. The principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite: (Ce, La, etc.)PO4 which contains 0.0001% of the element. The abundance of lutetium in the Earth crust is only about 0.5mg/kg. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. The world production of lutetium (in the form of oxide) is about 10 tonnes per year. Pure lutetium metal is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to prepare. It {{is one of the}} rarest and most expensive of the rare earth metals with the price about US$10,000 per kilogram, or about one-fourth that of gold.|$|E

5|$|His {{shooting}} accuracy {{combined with}} his long seven-foot frame and unique shooting mechanics, such as having a release point above his head, makes contesting his jump shots <b>very</b> <b>difficult.</b> Before {{the start of the}} 2011 NBA Finals, LeBron James called Nowitzki's one-legged fadeaway the second most unstoppable move ever, only behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's skyhook.|$|E
5|$|In any case, {{there was}} not enough artillery, but new pieces could not be brought in. This was because it was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to move them over land, and {{there was not}} enough ice to bring them over the sea.|$|E

5|$|Oil spills have {{devastating effects}} on the environment. Crude oil {{contains}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which are <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to clean up, and last for years in the sediment and marine environment. Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility to disease, and abnormal reproductive cycles.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises, {{as opposed}} to their dolphin counterparts, {{generally}} do not thrive in captivity, and are <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to maintain. The reopened Miyajima Aquarium in Hiroshima (Japan) houses three finless porpoises.

5|$|Manganese is a silvery-gray {{metal that}} resembles iron. It is hard and <b>very</b> brittle, <b>difficult</b> to fuse, but easy to oxidize. Manganese metal and its common ions are paramagnetic.

40|$|This report {{covers the}} {{development}} and evaluation of Neural Network models of complex dynamic systems. It describes the experimental and numerical procedures to identify a particular system, a Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) system, located in Carnegie Mellon, using recurrent neural net models for a multi-input multi-output control system. Neural Networks have an advantage over standard techniques for complex non-linear systems when it is <b>very</b> <b>difficults</b> to introduce a priori knowledge in the modeling. The complexity of the PECVD process makes it necessary to develop empirical models of the dynamics. Several possibilities were investigated and improvements were made over existing techniques. Also, some comparisons with standard system identification results were analysed. The report describes the work accomplised during the period between September 1994 and June 1995...|$|R

Many of the Chopin nocturnes have middle sections marked by agitated expression (and often making <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> demands on the performer) which heightens their dramatic character.|$|E
