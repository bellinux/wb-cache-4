5|$|At {{a conference}} in 2011, the two new leaders of the FN and the FPÖ, Marine Le Pen and Heinz-Christian Strache, {{announced}} deeper cooperation between their parties. Pursuing her de-demonization policy, in October 2011, Marine Le Pen, as new president of the National Front, joined the European Alliance for Freedom (EAF). The EAF is a pan-European sovereigntist platform founded late 2010 that is recognized by the European Parliament. The EAF has individual members linked to the Austrian Freedom Party of Heinz-Christian Strache, the UK Independence Party, and other movements such as the Sweden Democrats, <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang</b> (Belgian Flanders), Germany (Bürger in Wut), and Slovakia (Slovak National Party).|$|E
5|$|The {{leadership}} of the Vlaams Blok seized {{the occasion of the}} ban to dissolve the party, and start afresh under a new name. Five days later, on 14 November, the Vlaams Blok disbanded itself, and a new party with the name <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang</b> was established. (Other proposed names included the Flemish People's Party and Flemish Freedom Front.) The new party instituted a number of changes in its political program, carefully moderating some of the more extreme positions of the former Vlaams Blok. Nevertheless, the party leadership {{made it clear that the}} party would fundamentally remain the same.|$|E
5|$|All {{significant}} Flemish {{political parties}} {{were reluctant to}} enter coalitions with the Vlaams Blok. Following a 1989 agreement, known as the cordon sanitaire, the party was effectively blocked from entering any level of government. The Court of Appeal in Ghent in April 2004 ruled {{that some of the}} party's organizations had breached the 1981 anti-racism law and that the party sanctioned discrimination. The ruling was made definite on 9 November 2004, and the party shortly after reorganised itself as the <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang.</b> By 2004, the party had arguably become the single most popular Flemish party in Belgium, supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate, as well as being {{one of the most successful}} radical right-wing populist parties in Europe as a whole.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{an in-depth}} {{understanding of a}} specific case {{at the intersection of}} extreme right politics, marketing and language. More specifically, the research focuses on a Flemish extreme right party, the <b>Vlaams</b> Blok/Vlaams <b>Belang</b> which provides a rich site of enquiry for the analysis of political communications, marketing strategies and discursive processes. Critical discourse analysis of the verbal and visual elements of <b>Vlaams</b> Blok/Vlaams <b>Belang</b> publications reveals, on three levels, the strategic use of lexical, rhetorical and other linguistic devices to brand and differentiate the <b>Vlaams</b> Blok/Vlaams <b>Belang</b> from other political parties. The thesis demonstrates that the <b>Vlaams</b> Blok/Vlaams <b>Belang</b> manages to legitimate its political product by dismissing unfavourable features (such as racism and xenophobia), and repackaging them (as nationalist) for a wider audience as a ready-to-consume product that achieves electoral success. The main contributions of the thesis are fourfold. First, the research provides a marketing-related explanation {{of the success of the}} <b>Vlaams</b> Blok/Vlaams <b>Belang.</b> The pervasiveness of the <b>Vlaams</b> Blok/Vlaams <b>Belang's</b> discourse in Belgian politics makes the analysis of the party interesting in its own right. The critical discursive analysis reveals the underlying market-orientation of the party and the methods and techniques that the party uses to communicate and persuade. Second, this research demonstrates that marketing can be used to advance an ideological discourse that places consumption in a central position in people's lives. The application of critical discourse analysis thus provides a novel and valuable contribution to the understanding of political marketing. Third, the thesis sets the stage for furthering understanding of how marketing is deployed with increasing sophistication outside its traditional, commercial domain, and, more specifically, in politics. Finally, critical discourse analysis has an emancipatory goal in uncovering ideologies, and providing a voice to the silenced and the oppressed. This thesis is located firmly within that tradition with political reflexivity implicit throughout. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The largest Flemish separatist party was the <b>Vlaams</b> Blok/Vlaams <b>Belang</b> (VB) from 1991 to 2007. In the federal election 2010 and 2014, the largest separatist party was the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA). In 2007 the NVA was presenting a single list together with the Flemish Christian Democrats (CD&V).

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the interplay between}} nationalism and populism in the Flemish (North-Belgian), <b>Vlaams</b> Bloc/Vlaams <b>Belang’s</b> (VB), populist radical right rhetoric about expressive culture. Building on a discourse theoretical analysis of three extensive case studies (concerts against the VB, the opposition between the VB and the Flemish theatres, and the VB’s criticism of the Flemish National Songfest), {{and a number of}} other controversial moments the article shows that nationalist and populist discourse play different roles in VB rhetoric about expressive culture. Radical and exclusionary nationalism is the ideological core of the VB’s views on culture and of its relationships with artists. Populism is a strategy the party uses to position itself as the political representative of the people, to present its nationalist demands as the will of the people, and to dismiss opposition to the party and its radical and exclusionary nationalist ideology as elitist. The VB’s ‘positive’ populist strategy of associating with popular Flemish artists and genres, the article shows, has only had limited success. By contrast, the party’s ‘negative’ populist strategy of criticising artists as an elite has been instrumental in delegitimising the strong, mainly anti-racist, resistance from the part of artists against the VB. It has reduced artistic resistance to the VB and its ideology to support of the political elite. And it has presented artists themselves as an elite that is completely out of touch with the ordinary people who suffer from multicultural society. The VB’s nationalist-populist rhetoric about expressive culture has thus contributed to the construction of the antagonism that is central to its populist radical right politics: the antagonism between on the one hand the anti-Flemish and multiculturalist political, cultural, media, and intellectual elite and on the other hand the people and the radical and exclusionary Flemish nationalist VB as the party of the people...|$|R
5|$|At {{a conference}} in 2011, Strache and the new leader of the French National Front, Marine Le Pen, {{announced}} deeper cooperation between their parties. Shortly thereafter, the FPÖ attempted {{to become a member}} of the Europe for Freedom and Democracy group, but was vetoed by some of its parties. The FPÖ's two MEPs are individual members of the establishing European Alliance for Freedom. After the 2014 European elections, the party joined the National Front, the Northern League, <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang</b> and the Czech Civic Conservative Party in forming the Movement for a Europe of Nations and Freedom, and participated along with these parties, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the Alternative for Germany, the Polish Congress of the New Right and a former member of the UK Independence Party in the Europe of Nations and Freedom parliamentary group.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Strache, the party has cooperated mainly with the Northern League, <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang</b> (successor to the Vlaams Blok, which it has traditionally maintained good ties with), and the Pro Germany Citizens' Movement in Germany. The FPÖ also has contacts with the Danish People's Party, the Slovak National Party, the Sweden Democrats, the Lithuanian Order and Justice, IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement, the Dutch Party for Freedom, Alternative for Germany and the German Freedom party. In 2007, the party's then-only MEP {{was a member of}} the short-lived Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty grouping in the European Parliament. Outside the EU, it has contacts with Tomislav Nikolić of the Serbian Progressive Party (formerly of the Serbian Radical Party), the Swiss People's Party, the Israeli Likud, the U.S. Republican Party and the United Russia party.|$|E
5|$|The FN {{has been}} part of several groups in the European Parliament. The first group it helped co-establish was the European Right after the 1984 election, which also {{consisted}} of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), its early inspiration, and the Greek National Political Union. Following the 1989 election, it teamed up with the German Republicans and the Belgian Vlaams Blok in a new European Right group, while the MSI left due to the Germans' arrival. As the MSI evolved into the National Alliance, it chose to distance itself from the FN. From 1999 to 2001, the FN {{was a member of the}} Technical Group of Independents. In 2007, it was part of the short-lived Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty group. Between the mentioned groups, the party sat among the non-affiliated Non-Inscrits. It leads the Europe of Nations and Freedom group, which also includes the Freedom Party of Austria, Polish Congress of the New Right, Italian Northern League, <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang,</b> the Alternative for Germany, the Dutch Freedom Party, a former member of the UK Independence Party and a former member of Romania's Conservative Party. They're also part of the Movement for a Europe of Nations and Freedom since 2014.|$|E
40|$|The Routledge Companion to Ethics, Politics and Organizations synthesizes {{and extends}} {{existing}} research on ethics in organizations by explicitly focusing on ‘ethico-politics’ - where ethics informs political action. It draws connections between ethics {{and politics in}} and around organizations and the workplace, examines cutting-edge areas and sets the scene for future research. Through a wealth of international and multidisciplinary contributions this volume considers {{the broad range of}} ways in which ethics and politics can be conceived and understood. The chapters look at various ethical traditions, as well as the discursive deployment of ethical terminology in organizational settings, and they also examine large scale political structures and processes and how they relate to different forms of politics which affect behaviour in organizations. These many possibilities are united by a focus on how ethics can be used to inform and justify the exercise of power in organizations. This collection will be a valuable reference source for students and researchers across the disciplines of organizational studies, ethics and politics.

25|$|On 24 May 2014, the National Front won the European {{election}} in France with 24.90% of the vote. Marine Le Pen came {{in first place}} in her North-West constituency with a score of 33.60%. 25 FN members {{were sent to the}} European Parliament of Strasbourg. They voted against the Juncker Commission in July. One year later, she was able to announce the formation of a group composed of the French National Front, the Freedom Party of Austria, the Italian Lega Nord, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the Polish Congress of the New Right, the Flemish <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang</b> and former UKIP member Janice Atkinson. Her first attempt to constitute this group in 2014 failed because of the UKIP refusal and some controversial statements of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in June. Le Pen sat in the commission for international trade. In 2016, Politico ranked her as the second-most influential MEP after Martin Schulz.|$|E
25|$|In an {{international}} press meeting, the Flemish nationalist party <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang</b> {{said that the}} formation crisis {{was an example of}} Belgium's failure to function as a state and that {{the time had come to}} declare Flemish independence. On September 1, the Flemish newspaper De Standaard devoted an issue to the question of whether a Flemish secession was realistic and viable. On September 2, during De Gordel, an annual Flemish cycling event in the periphery of Brussels with a strong political undertone, Eric Van Rompuy (member of the CD and the brother of explorateur Herman) and Bart De Wever (N-VA) emphasized that this should be the last De Gordel in which the problems surrounding the BHV were not solved. Flemish minister Geert Bourgeois (N-VA) also stated that the Flemish majority in the newly elected parliament should urgently solve the problem unilaterally - i.e. without the consent of the French speaking parties and thus without any offers. Other politicians, such as Flemish minister-president Kris Peeters (CD) and federal minister of Internal Affairs Patrick Dewael (Open VLD) participated in the event, but did not comment on BHV. Prominent absentees were Yves Leterme and Guy Verhofstadt.|$|E
500|$|The Progress Party has by some been {{compared}} to parties such as the Dutch Pim Fortuyn List, French Front National and the Freedom Party of Austria. It has been approached for cooperation by some of these parties, including the Belgian <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang,</b> French Front National and the Freedom Party of Austria, only to be rejected by the Progress Party. In 2008, the Progress Party international secretary Kristian Norheim specifically distanced the Progress Party from such parties. He regarded many of these parties to be [...] "national social democratic", and stressed their lack of liberalism as inconsistent with the Progress Party's platform. The Progress Party has also {{been compared}} to the Alternative for Germany by Jan Simonsen, who he also cited as a blending of conservatives and economic liberals.|$|E
500|$|Investigative {{journalist}} Max Blumenthal, {{who reported}} on {{an attempt by}} one of the show's staff to advertise at a rally for Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, described The Political Cesspool as having a [...] "racist ideology", and highlighted anti-Semitic, racist, and homophobic comments that Edwards had made on his blog. The Stephen Roth Institute has also commented on the show, noting that [...] " [...] Edwards openly espoused many of his guests' views and during speeches to extremist audiences, including members of the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens and the racist League of the South, he gained the support of a wide array of extremists." [...] In an article about antisemitism in Belgium, the Institute commented on the show's interview with Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian Parliament and a leader of the extremist <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang</b> movement.|$|E
500|$|Professor Lamine (KUL), {{a former}} Vlaams Blok member and [...] "advisor" [...] of the party's legal team, {{claimed that the}} party, for {{propaganda}} reasons, purposely undertook a weak defence, in order to lose the case; [...] "For the party leaders, losing was much more interesting. Winning just wasn't an option." [...] Lamine himself had earlier stated that the party should have carried the trial to the European Court of Human Rights, but Vlaams Blok senator Joris Van Hauthem had already stated in 2005, that; [...] "If we had gone to Strasbourg [...] based on procedural arguments, we {{might have had a}} case. But Lamine already put in a private claim to overturn the Appeals Court verdict, on the basis of substantive arguments. If <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang</b> were to put forth a claim against the verdict as well, at Strasbourg, the Court will bundle both cases. Then we would lose the case for sure. Lamine has thus given us the final blow." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon his {{election}} to the European Parliament Griffin unsuccessfully tried to form an alliance with right-wing parties, which would have entitled the group members to extra funding. He also held talks with other far-right European parties, such as <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang</b> and Jobbik. The BNP maintains ties with Roberto Fiore and fascist groups across Europe. Griffin criticised Gordon Brown's Labour government for its attitude toward the BNP, accusing it of treating elected representatives of the BNP as [...] "second-class citizens". Following {{his election}}, {{in a press conference}} held at a public house in Manchester, he criticised the privatisation of national industries, such as the railway network, and accused MPs generally of being involved in this [...] "...giant looting of Britain". He accused private corporations and the [...] "ruling elite" [...] in Britain of building a [...] "Eurocratic state", a process he called [...] "Mussolini fascism... under Gordon Brown." [...] He supported the Gurkhas, stating that the BNP would allow them and their families entry to the country for medical treatment [...] "{{for as long as they}} needed treatment, or for as long as they lived." [...] He also suggested the removal of 100,000 Muslims [...] "disloyal to Britain" [...] and their replacement with the Gurkhas.|$|E
500|$|On June 16, 2007, 200 people {{gathered}} in a protest organized by Pro Cologne against the mosque including representatives from the Austrian Freedom Party and the Belgian <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang.</b> Then district deputy mayor Uckermann seconded that he thinks many residents reject the mosque {{because they believe that}} Cologne is a “Christian city”. The prominent author Ralph Giordano stated that he opposed the project as the mosque would be “an expression of the creeping Islamization of our land”, a “declaration of war”, and that he wouldn't want to see women wearing headscarfs on German streets, likening their appearance to “human penguins”. Henryk M. Broder, a journalist, disagrees with Giordano's metaphor but said that “A mosque is more than a church or a synagogue. It is a political statement.” Giordano's remarks have turned the local dispute into a national debate about the place of Islam in Germany. and other prominent Germans criticized the project as well. District mayor Uckermann stated that Giordano's comments “broke down the wall. Before if you criticised this monstrous mosque you were a Nazi. But we {{have a problem with the}} integration of Muslims. It's a question of language and culture.” Uckermann left the conservative CDU for right-wing Pro Cologne in 2008 after being voted out of office as the district's deputy mayor and reportedly facing party exclusion.The city's official for integration Marlis Bredehorst stated that [...] "it is important that the Muslims here get dignified houses of prayer" [...] and added that [...] "two hundred years ago, the Protestants had to pray secretively in Catholic Cologne [...] that is something we can't imagine anymore today." [...] The city's mayor, Fritz Schramma, who supports the project said that “For me, it is self-evident that the Muslims need to have a prestigious place of worship, but it bothers me when people have lived here for 35 years and they don’t speak a single word of German.” Christian leaders have taken similarly ambivalent stances: the Catholic Church has long supported the project, though recently Cardinal Joachim Meisner, Archbishop of Cologne, has been more cautious: when asked if he was afraid of the mosque, he said, “I don't want to say I'm afraid, but I have an uneasy feeling.” He also stated that Turkey should allow its Christian minorities equivalent rights. He said the mosque would change the skyline of Cologne. Wolfgang Huber, Germany's top Protestant bishop, criticized the “male domination” he saw in Islam and said Muslims should be able to convert to Christianity without fearing reprisals and the penalty of death.|$|E
2500|$|Filip Dewinter of the <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang</b> {{proposed}} {{to have an}} earlier plenary session in the Flemish parliament to discuss the communitarian crisis, a request that was granted. On September 10, under {{the eyes of the}} international media, he proposed in the plenary session to prepare a plan for an independent Flanders and to hold a referendum on independence. He said that the Flemish resolutions agreed upon in the Flemish parliament in 1999 (that supported a far-reaching devolution of powers) were a breaking point. He also called Belgium [...] "a country that is terminally ill" [...] and {{that it was time to}} say [...] "bye bye Belgium".|$|E
5000|$|Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a {{prominent}} critic of Islam in the Netherlands, {{and to whom}} <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang</b> on different occasions referred to defend its points of view on Islam, called the party [...] "a racist, anti-Semitic, extremist party that is unkind to women {{and that should be}} outlawed." [...] According to <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang,</b> Ali had been misinformed. The party considered this {{to be part of a}} smear campaign. <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang</b> underlined that Ali supposedly made the statement on the occasion of a debate organised by the left-liberal think tank Liberales, whose president is Dirk Verhofstadt. <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang</b> added that Dirk Verhofstadt is known for regularly publishing accusations against the party. <b>Vlaams</b> <b>Belang</b> also wrote an open letter to Ali.|$|E
