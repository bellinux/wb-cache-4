40|$|Soil {{loss and}} surface runoff {{patterns}} over a four-year period (1997 ¿ 2000) were studied in erosion plots from three hillslopes under different <b>vegetative</b> <b>covers</b> (Rosmarinus officinalis, Triticum aestivum and natural-spontaneous vegetation) in Lanjaron (Alpujarras) {{on the south}} flank of the Sierra Nevada of southeast Spain. The erosion plots were located on the hillslopes at 35. 5 % incline, at 1, 480 m in altitude and with 41. 8 m 2 (21 m× 1. 9 m) in area. The <b>vegetative</b> <b>covers</b> were tested for effectiveness in controlling the surface runoff and soil loss production. The highest runoff and erosion values, ranging from 114. 1 to 1. 7 mm yr- 1 and from 14, 564. 3 to 6. 6 kg ha- 1 yr- 1, respectively, over the entire study period, were measured under the Triticum aestivum. In the Rosmarinus officinalis, runoff ranged from 7. 9 to 1. 3 mm yr- 1 and erosion from 156. 4 to 2. 3 kg ha- 1 yr- 1, while on the hillslope under natural-spontaneous vegetation, runoff ranged from 4. 4 to 0. 9 mm yr- 1 and erosion from 322. 3 to 2. 2 kg ha- 1 yr- 1. According to the results the <b>vegetative</b> <b>covers</b> of Rosmarinus officinalis and natural-spontaneous vegetation reduced the soil losses by 99 and 98 %, {{with respect to the}} Triticum aestivum, and the runoff losses by 94 and 96 %, respectively. Also, the Rosmarinus officinalis and natural-spontaneous plants influenced infiltration by intercepting much of the rainfall water respect to the Triticum aestivum. Monitoring allowed more direct linkages to be made between management practices and their impacts on runoff and soil erosion, thereby enabling to identify problems and take appropriate preventive measures to improve the management practice...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Seedlings of five native tussock species {{grown in}} the {{glasshouse}} on mountain subsoil showed outstanding responses to nitrogen and phosphorus fertiliser in combination. The most vigorous species was silver mssock but this produced less dry matter than an introduced grass, Yorkshire fog, grown on the same soil. Tussocks in general responded positively to applications of magnesium and potassium but growth was depressed by lime. In field sowings at two sites under different <b>vegetative</b> <b>covers</b> tussock seedling survivals over a five summer period were very low. Improved survival in early years through protection by cover species appeared to be offset in later years by competition for nutrients from the same species.

Vegetative input parameters measured in the field during this study include root depth, root length density, and percent bare area.

40|$|Hydrologic {{processes}} in the pinyon-juniper woodlands of the western region of the United States are variable because of the inherent interactions among the occurring precipitation regimes, geomorphological settings, and edaphic conditions that characterize the ecosystem.

Heterogeneous <b>vegetative</b> <b>covers</b> make it even more difficult to generalize hydrologic processes and the effects of land management practices on the water balance. Nevertheless, estimates of interception, infiltration, evapotranspiration, soil moisture storage, and hillslope soil erosion of these on-site hydrologic processes have been obtained in plot studies.

25|$|Normally {{snow has}} little overall {{direct effect on}} stream-flow within the watershed. However, on rare {{occasions}} warm rains falling on the snow-pack may result in rapid melting and release of large quantities of water {{at a time when}} the soils are already fully saturated. These conditions result in rapid runoff and floods. A large proportion of the exposed surface rock in the Barouk region is cavernous, fissured and broken limestone, and its porous condition makes it very permeable. This results in much of the precipitation infiltrating with minimum surface runoff despite the often-shallow soils and sparse <b>vegetative</b> <b>cover.</b> Water percolates downward through the various formations and feeds the many large springs found on lower slopes in the area. Such springs help maintain stream-flow during the April to November dry season.|$|E

We reviewed the ecological literature on prairie and grassland communities with specific reference to habitat templates from stressed environmental conditions and examined analogs of prairie-based vegetation on twenty-one existing green roofs.

In this chapter we describe {{the development of an}} efficient method to assess land degradation (specifically waterlogging and saline and acid soils) at a regional scale. We developed spa-tial models by integrating knowledge of landscape processes with remotely sensed, terrain and field data, within a geographic information system (GIS). The key to this approach was the linkage of soil and hydrological processes (identified at the point scale) to mapped soil units via toposequences, and the allocation of land degradation classes to each of the units. The data were aggregated to catchment and regional scale to produce maps of land degradation. The results obtained from the modelling were validated by random ground assessments of sites across the region. The method described here could be applied to the assessment of other types of land degrada-tion, and to other regions with comparable landscapes and <b>vegetative</b> <b>covers,</b> where similar soils, terrain and remotely sensed data exist...|$|R
