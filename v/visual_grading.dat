40|$|For <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> experiments, {{which are}} an easy and {{increasingly}} popular way of studying image quality, hitherto used data analysis methods are often inadequate. <b>Visual</b> <b>grading</b> analysis makes assumptions {{that are not}} statistically appropriate for ordinal data, and <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> characteristic curves are difficult to apply in more complex experimental designs. The approach proposed in this paper, <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> regression (VGR), consists of an established statistical technique, ordinal logistic regression, applied to data from single-image and image-pair experiments with <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> scores selected on an ordinal scale. The approach is applicable for situations in which, for example, {{the effects of the}} choice of imaging equipment and post-processing method are to be studied simultaneously, while controlling for potentially confounding variables such as patient and observer identity. The analysis can be performed with standard statistical software packages using straightforward coding of the data. We conclude that the proposed statistical technique is useful {{in a wide range of}} <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> studies.

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Visual</b> <b>grading</b> of the {{reproduction}} of important anatomical structures {{is often used to}} determine clinical image quality in radiography. However, many <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> methods incorrectly use statistical methods that require data belonging to an interval scale. The rating data from the observers in a <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> study with multiple ratings is ordinal, meaning that non-parametric rank-invariant statistical methods are required. This paper describes such a method for determining the difference in image quality between two modalities called <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> characteristics (VGC) analysis. In a VGC study, the task of the observer is to rate his confidence about the fulfilment of image quality criteria. The rating data for the two modalities are then analysed {{in a manner similar to}} that used in receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. The resulting measure of image quality is the VGC curve, which – for all possible thresholds of the observer for a fulfilled criterion – describes the relationship between the proportions of fulfilled image criteria for the two compared modalities. The area under the VGC curve is proposed as a single measure of the difference in image quality between two compared modalities. It is also described how VGC analysis can be applied to data from an absolute <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> analysis study...|$|E

The {{influence}} of <b>visual</b> assessment <b>grade</b> on the residual flexural capacity of 46 existing precast concrete ribbed panels from different agricultural buildings was studied. Before the tests the panels were assessed on a 6 -point rating scale according to visually distinguishable corrosion deterioration. All panels, the ultimate load {{of which was}} lower than the control load, received grade 0 on the visual rating scale. Consequently, attention should be paid to panels where the concrete cover of longitudinal reinforcement has spalled (grade 0) which could {{be a sign of}} decreasing load capacity. The majority of panels with grade 0 exhibited larger deflections under load than panels with higher grades. Of the 46 panels tested flexural ductile failure was noticed at 36 panels.

30|$|Previous {{studies of}} the {{mechanical}} properties of Hem-Fir (N) show that the design values of the wood species group D are conservative for Hem-Fir (N) lamina if visually graded and should be put into the group classification [4 – 6].

40|$|The current gold-standard {{method for}} {{diagnosing}} exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction (EILO) is continuous laryngoscopy during exercise (CLE), with severity classified by a <b>visual</b> <b>grade</b> scoring system. We evaluated {{the precision of}} this approach, by evaluating test–retest reliability of CLE and both inter- and intra-rater variability. In this prospective case–control study, subjects completed four consecutive treadmill CLE tests under identical conditions. Laryngoscopic video recordings were anonymised and graded by three expert raters. 2  months following initial scoring, videos were re-randomised and rating repeated to assess intra-rater agreement. 20 subjects (16 cases and four controls) completed four CLE tests. The time to exhaustion increased by 30  s (95 % CI 0. 02 – 57. 8, p< 0. 05) in the second CLE compared with the first test, but remained identical in the subsequent tests. Only one-third of subjects retained their initial diagnosis in the subsequent three tests. Inter-rater agreement on grade scores (weighted Cohen's ϰ) was 0. 16 – 0. 45, while intra-rater agreement ranged from 0. 30 to 0. 67.

30|$|The {{advantages}} of using <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> {{studies in the}} evaluation of clinical images are that these can be carried out with clinically available images and {{there is no need for}} a gold standard during the evaluation. However the use of appropriate data analysis methods should be emphasised. The terminology in this field is somewhat confusing as some authors use VGA to denote standard statistical tests with assumptions that may not be appropriate since the data in a VGA str ordinal. Analysing <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> analysis methods with parametrical statistical tests such as t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) incorrectly assumes the grading data are an interval variable; VGC and ordinal regression analysis correctly treat <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> data as ordinal and categorical [29].|$|E

40|$|BackgroundThe {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a new <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> system for the {{vascular}} ratio, to assess the correlation of the prognostic significance of the <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> system, tumoral blood flow velocity and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) antigen serum levels in invasive SCC of the cervix. Patients and MethodsA total of 117 patients with invasive cervical carcinoma were enrolled for the assessment of vascular grading and tumor flow using transvaginal ultrasound with power Doppler angiography (TV-PDA) before treatment. The modified <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> system of the vascular ratio (grades 1 to 3) and six blood flow characteristics of tumor vessels (pulsatility index, resistance index, peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, time-averaged maximum velocity, vascular index) were measured by TV-PDA. In addition, serum levels of SCC antigen were randomly obtained in 74 patients with invasive cervical SCC (stages Ia to IIIb) before treatment. ResultsThe modified <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> system of the vascular ratio significantly correlated with pretreatment SCC antigen serum levels (p < 0. 05) and intratumoral resistance index values (p < 0. 05, r 2 = 0. 49) from multiple regression analysis in 71 patients with invasive SCC of the cervix. Modified <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> of the vascular ratio negatively correlated with intratumoral resistance index values (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r = − 0. 571, p = 0. 001), but positively correlated with pretreatment serum levels of SCC antigen (r = 0. 296, p = 0. 012). In addition, this modified vascularity grading positively correlated with FIGO stage (r = 0. 336, p = 0. 004) by correlation analysis. ConclusionThe modified <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> system of the vascular ratio is a valuable sonographic marker in assessing invasive cervical carcinoma. The three major advantages of this semi-quantitative analysis are ease of discrimination, immediate results, and avoiding wasting time. This semi-quantitative analysis with pretreatment SCC antigen serum levels are two effective markers for assessing invasive cervical carcinoma...|$|E

The technique groups differed in tube voltage and detector system characteristics. Six different gradients of the H&D curves were simulated. The <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> analysis showed larger differences in image quality compared with the absolute method. The influence on the image quality due to a variation in tube voltage was easier to detect than the influence on the image quality from the detector characteristics.

30|$|In 2007 Bath and Mansson {{indicated}} the inappropriate analysis of <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> data using parametric tests and recommended a novel method of analysing such data called <b>Visual</b> <b>Grading</b> of Characteristics: VGC analysis. VGC treats the scale steps as ordinal with no assumptions {{on the distribution}} of the data [25]. The resemblance between VGC and receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis leads to the possibility of using the well-established ROC evaluation methods in analysing VGC data. The variation in the <b>visual</b> <b>grading</b> of the reviewers of two imaging techniques can be used to describe the variation between the two techniques {{in the same way as}} in an ROC study. VGC can be considered as a repeated image criteria scoring, where reviewers change their threshold for the necessity of fulfilling each criterion in a similar way to the scale steps in an ROC study. The reviewers therefore state their confidence concerning the fulfilment of a criterion obtaining an ordinal scale. As in ROC analysis, the different ratings do not necessarily correspond to the same numerical intervals on the decision scale nor do all reviewers use the ratings with the same meaning since the ordinal scale is just used to test the probability distribution for each imaging technique [25].|$|E
