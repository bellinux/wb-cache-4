5|$|Doors and vents {{often had}} sills of {{carefully}} ground flat stone slabs and lintels constructed from {{a row of}} thin wood beams. Chacoan masons also frequently included intramural beams – horizontal logs completely enclosed in the wall core – which were probably intended to reduce horizontal deformation of the wall. The interior walls of great houses were typically covered in a rock <b>veneer.</b> Judd identified four distinct types, and his typology is the most commonly accepted in the region. Chetro Ketl's interior walls, particularly those in the eastern wing, were covered in a Type IV <b>veneer</b> characterized by uniform pieces of sandstone with little to no exposed mortar. Judd excluded a fifth type of masonry, called McElmo style, from his typology.|$|E

5|$|Balabushka {{cues from}} the Gus Szamboti era are typified by {{straight}} grained maple forearms bearing four ebony points, with four veneers included, normally colored black, green, white and mahogany, or sometimes with an orange <b>veneer</b> {{in place of}} mahogany. Balabushka cues from this era, spanning {{the last five years}} of his life, are considered the finest of his career as a class. There have been unconfirmed rumors that some few cues made during this period included splices made by Balabushka himself.|$|E
50|$|Core <b>Veneers</b> -- Core <b>veneers</b> {{have the}} same basic {{requirements}} as face <b>veneers,</b> except that small splits are allowed, {{and there is no}} limit on the number of pin knots or edge joints. However, end joints are not permitted.|$|R
30|$|The {{splitting}} length {{was measured}} after the <b>veneers</b> were dried. Drying {{was likely to}} exaggerate the splitting lengths but was assumed to affect all <b>veneers</b> equally in this study. In addition, rough handling and peeling settings can {{also contribute to the}} splitting of <b>veneers.</b> It was assumed that all <b>veneers</b> were equally affected in these ways and the differences among them were mainly caused by growth-stress.|$|R
40|$|This {{is a book}} chapter. <b>Veneers</b> are {{slices of}} wood cut to a {{particular}} thickness, {{that are used in}} two major ways: firstly, for structural wood products such as plywood or laminates and secondly for decorative surface <b>veneers,</b> the latter often having a high value or prominent or unusual appearance. The use of <b>veneers</b> has a long and illustrious history and for hundreds of years <b>veneers</b> were prepared by hand. Since the early nineteenth century <b>veneers</b> have been generally produced by three methods: sawing, slicing or rotary cutting...|$|R
5|$|Over the centuries, {{numerous}} durian cultivars, propagated by vegetative clones, {{have arisen}} in southeast Asia. They {{used to be}} grown with mixed results from seeds of trees bearing superior quality fruit, but now are propagated by layering, marcotting, or more commonly, by grafting, including bud, <b>veneer,</b> wedge, whip or U-grafting onto seedlings of randomly selected rootstocks. Different cultivars may be distinguished to some extent by variations in the fruit shape, such as {{the shape of the}} spines. Durian consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.|$|E
5|$|Since 1992, {{the city}} has {{undergone}} several boundary expansions. One expansion incorporated undeveloped land in the southeast for an industrial park and a Louisiana-Pacific Canada <b>veneer</b> factory. The city extended sewer and water lines to the location; however, the area was not developed and with the factory only half-built, L-P Canada abandoned its plans. A business making manufactured homes bought the factory and completed its development in 2005. Another expansion incorporated the existing oriented strand board factory in {{the northwest corner of}} the city, while further incorporations have included undeveloped land to the south and north.|$|E
5|$|Since medieval times, dubbin, a waxy product, {{was used}} to soften and {{waterproof}} leather; however, it did not impart shine. It was made from natural wax, oil, soda ash and tallow. As leather with a high natural <b>veneer</b> became popular in the 18th century, a high glossy finish became important, particularly on shoes and boots. In most cases, a variety of homemade polishes were used to provide this finish, often with lanolin or beeswax as a base.|$|E

50|$|Rock <b>veneers</b> form {{a variety}} of ways, with two major types; in situ <b>veneers</b> form in place by means of weathering, fluvial erosion, {{deflation}} (the removal of loose, fine-grained particles) or accretion; other <b>veneers</b> are transported via soil creep, sheet flooding or gully gravure (described below). Rock <b>veneers</b> are typically distinguished through six variables: particle size, particle density, stability characteristics, potential for storing mobile sediments, degree of abrasion, and varnishing.|$|R

5|$|Edward's {{body was}} embalmed at Berkeley Castle, {{where it was}} viewed by local leaders from Bristol and Gloucester. It was then taken to Gloucester Abbey on 21 October, and on 20 December Edward was buried by the high altar, the funeral having {{probably}} been delayed to allow Edward III to attend in person. Gloucester was probably chosen because other abbeys had refused or been forbidden to take the King's body, {{and because it was}} close to Berkeley. The funeral was a grand affair and cost £351 in total, complete with gilt lions, standards painted with gold leaf and oak barriers to manage the anticipated crowds. Edward III's government probably hoped to put a <b>veneer</b> of normality over the recent political events, increasing the legitimacy of the young King's own reign.|$|E
5|$|GameSpot and GameSpy {{called the}} dialog sharply written, with many memorable lines. Eurogamer {{noted that the}} characters' {{frequent}} use of vulgar language worked; written as real people, such language fit their character rather than giving the game an adult <b>veneer.</b> The website appreciated the breadth of dialog options, allowing the player greater control of how to play their character. PC Zone opined that the quantity of well-written dialog did not guarantee quality; many player choices seemed to have little effect on a conversation's outcome, and the best response was often the most obvious. The voice acting was repeatedly praised for the actors' quality {{and the amount of}} voice work, due to the many dialog options.|$|E
5|$|Skyline Drive was {{originally}} lined with miles of chestnut log guardrails. However, the guardrails rotted and were removed in the 1950s and not replaced. The Marys Rock Tunnel was partially lined with concrete in 1958 to prevent icicles {{in the winter}} and water seepage in the summer. In 1983, the Federal Highway Administration began work to replace several of the original stone walls on the drive with concrete walls that used the original stone as a <b>veneer.</b> The road was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 28, 1997. On September 22, 2005, Skyline Drive was designated a National Scenic Byway. Skyline Drive was designated a National Historic Landmark in October 2008 for its pioneering place in the development of national parks in the eastern United States.|$|E

5|$|The Praetorian Guard was {{an elite}} {{unit of the}} Roman army formed by Augustus in 27 BC, with the {{specific}} function {{to serve as a}} bodyguard to the emperor and members of the imperial family. Much more than a guard however, the Praetorians also managed the day-to-day care of the city, such as general security and civil administration. Furthermore, their presence served as a constant reminder to the people and the Senate of the substantial armed force which served {{as the basis for the}} imperial power. Augustus was careful however to uphold the republican <b>veneer</b> of this regime, and only allowed nine cohorts to be formed (one fewer than in a normal Roman legion), which were inconspicuously scattered across various lodging houses in the city, and commanded by two prefects.|$|E
5|$|Weeks later, Jernigan filed a counter-suit against Wilkinson in Fayette County circuit court. He {{asked the}} court to award him $50 million in punitive damages and to {{determine}} the profits made by his and Wilkinson's <b>veneer</b> company, of which he would receive half. A judge ordered the case moved to Louisville because the alleged crime was committed in Glasgow, in the state's western district. State charges against Jernigan, which included kidnapping and carrying a concealed deadly weapon, were dropped so that the federal extortion charges could take precedence. Over the objection of his legal counsel, the court ordered Jernigan to undergo a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he was insane or mentally incompetent for his own defense. The court-appointed psychiatrist found Jernigan competent to stand trial, and he was released in late May on a $25,000 bond.|$|E

5|$|In the 1910s, Omak {{was chosen}} as the {{location}} for a sawmill to expand economic growth. Omak Fruit Growers controlled the mill and a nearby orchard processing factory. The Biles-Coleman Lumber Company bought out the organization and built a sawmill outside municipal boundaries on the nearby Omak Mountain in 1924. A secondary sawmill was constructed in the Omak area. The company and their mills were purchased in 1975 by Crown Zellerbach and thus an associated organizationCavenham Forest Industriesacquired the mills. The company ultimately went bankrupt, and in response, employees purchased the mill for 45 million dollars and renamed it Omak Wood Products in an attempt to save their jobs. Omak Woods Products' payroll decreased to 480 in the early 1990s and later went bankrupt themselves, along with Quality <b>Veneer,</b> who later owned the property for 19 million dollars until 2000. The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation later purchased the mill for 6.6 million dollars, having closed in 2009 because of low demand, ending over 130 jobs. As of 2013, there are proposals to reopen the mills during the summer season.|$|E
5|$|Organic finds {{are rarely}} well {{documented}} with hoards, because most coin and treasure finds are removed hastily by the finder or have previously been disrupted by farm work rather than excavated. The Hoxne organic finds included bone, wood and other plant material, and leather. Small fragments from a decorated ivory pyxis (a cylindrical lidded box) were found, {{along with more}} than 150 tiny shaped pieces of bone inlay or <b>veneer,</b> probably from a wooden box or boxes that have decayed. Minuscule fragments of wood adhering to metal objects were identified as belonging to nine species of timber, all native to Britain: wood traces associated with the iron fittings of the outer chest established that {{it was made of}} oak. Silver locks and hinges were from two small wooden boxes or caskets, one made of decorative cherry wood and one made of yew. Some wheat straw survived from padding between the plain silver bowls, which also bore faint traces of linen cloth. Leather fragments were too degraded for identification.|$|E
5|$|The December 1964 South Vietnamese coup {{took place}} before dawn on December 19, 1964, when the ruling {{military}} junta of South Vietnam led by General Nguyễn Khánh dissolved the High National Council (HNC) and arrested {{some of its}} members. The HNC was an unelected legislative-style civilian advisory body they had created {{at the request of}} the United States—South Vietnam's main sponsor—to give a <b>veneer</b> of civilian rule. The dissolution dismayed the Americans, particularly the ambassador, Maxwell D. Taylor, who engaged in an angry war of words with various generals including Khánh and threatened aid cuts. They were unable to do anything about the fait accompli that had been handed to them, because they strongly desired to win the Vietnam War and needed to support the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. Instead, Taylor's searing verbal attacks were counterproductive as they galvanized the Vietnamese officers around the embattled Khánh. At the time, Khánh's leadership was under threat from his fellow generals, as well as Taylor, who had fallen out with him and was seeking his removal.|$|E
