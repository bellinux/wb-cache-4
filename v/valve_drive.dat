50|$|The {{simplest}} form of gab {{valve gear}} or 'gab clutch' {{was a simple}} notch in the valve rod, where it hooked over the valve spindle. A hand lever allowed this notch to be lifted, thus disengaging the <b>valve</b> <b>drive</b> and promptly stopping the engine.|$|E

50|$|This {{was usually}} poppet <b>valves</b> <b>driven</b> by camshafts. In the steam motors built by Sentinel, the motor {{was derived from}} their already {{advanced}} steam wagon design.|$|R
50|$|Poppet valves {{typically}} require small coil springs, appropriately named valve springs, to {{keep them}} closed when not actuated by the camshaft. They {{are attached to the}} valve stem ends, seating within spring retainers. Other mechanisms can be used in place of valve springs to keep the valves closed: Formula 1 engines employ pneumatic valve springs in which pneumatic pressure closes the valves, while motorcycle manufacturer Ducati uses desmodromic <b>valve</b> <b>drive</b> which mechanically close the valves.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the days}} when <b>valve</b> <b>drive</b> {{dynamics}} could be analyzed by computer, desmodromic drive seemed to offer solutions for problems that were worsening with increasing engine speed. Since those days, lift, velocity, acceleration, and jerk curves for cams have been modelled by computer to reveal that cam dynamics are not what they seemed. With proper analysis, problems relating to valve adjustment, hydraulic tappets, push rods, rocker arms, and above all, valve float, became things of the past without desmodromic drive.|$|E
50|$|Valve springs {{that do not}} {{resonate}} are progressive, wound {{with varying}} pitch or varying diameter called beehive springsfrom their shape. The number of active coils in these springs varies during the stroke, the more closely wound coils being on the static end, becoming inactive as the spring compresses or as in the beehive spring, where the small diameter coils at the top are stiffer. Both mechanisms reduce resonance because spring force and its moving mass vary with stroke. This advance in spring design removed valve float, the initial impetus for desmodromic <b>valve</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E

50|$|The four {{banks of}} four {{cylinders}} were {{arranged in a}} flattened 'X' when viewed from the front. The angle between the upper cylinders was 52.5 degrees, the lower cylinders 127.5 degrees, which gave an angle of 90 degrees between the outer cylinder banks. The cylinders consisted of separate individual steel forgings with welded steel water cooling jackets. The carburettor was situated below the propeller reduction gear {{at the front of}} the engine and fed the inlet valves through four inlet manifolds. The <b>valve</b> <b>drive</b> gear, magnetos and pumps were fitted to the rear of the crankcase.|$|E
50|$|Cars were {{required}} to be designed with a separate wastegate for exhaust gases to pass through {{in a bid to}} increase the noise of the cars following criticism since the introduction of the 2014 generation of engines. The FIA also opted {{to increase the number of}} tokens available for power unit development starting in 2016. While the initial plans would have given manufacturers fifteen tokens for the season, the number was raised to thirty-two, the same number as 2014, in order to allow struggling manufacturers such as Renault and Honda to improve their development. This decision also allowed further development on parts that were initially planned to be closed off, including the upper and lower crankcase, <b>valve</b> <b>drive,</b> crankshaft, air-valve system and ancillaries drive.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1830s {{the most}} popular <b>valve</b> <b>drive</b> for {{locomotives}} was known as gab motion in the U.K. and V-hook motion in the U.S.A. The gab motion incorporated two sets of eccentrics and rods for each cylinder; one eccentric was set to give forward and the other backwards motion to the engine and {{one or the other}} could accordingly engage with a pin driving the distribution valve by means of the gabs: - vee-shaped ends to the eccentric rods supposed to catch the rocker driving the valve rod whatever its position. It was a clumsy mechanism, difficult to operate, and only gave fixed valve events. In 1841 two employees in Stephenson’s locomotive works, draughtsman William Howe and pattern-maker William Williams, suggested the simple expedient of replacing the gabs with a vertical slotted link, pivoted at both ends to the tips of the eccentric rods. To change direction, the link and rod ends were bodily raised or lowered by means of a counterbalanced bell crank worked by a reach rod that connected it to the reversing lever. This not only simplified reversing but it was realised that the gear could be raised or lowered in small increments, and thus the combined motion from the “forward” and “back” eccentrics in differing proportions would impart shorter travel to the valve, cutting off admission steam earlier in the stroke and using a smaller amount steam expansively in the cylinder, using its own energy rather than continuing to draw from the boiler. It became the practice to start the engine or climb gradients at long cutoff, usually about 70-80% maximum of the power stroke and to shorten the cutoff as momentum was gained to benefit from the economy of expansive working and the effect of increased lead and higher compression {{at the end of each}} stroke. This process was popularly known as [...] "linking up" [...] or “notching up”, the latter because the reversing lever could be held in precise positions by means of a catch on the lever engaging notches in a quadrant; the term stuck even after the introduction of the screw reverser. A further intrinsic advantage of the Stephenson gear not found in most other types was variable lead. Depending on how the gear was laid out, it was possible to considerably reduce compression and back pressure at the end of each piston stroke when working at low speed in full gear; once again as momentum was gained and cutoff shortened, so lead was automatically advanced and compression increased, cushioning the piston at the end of each stroke and heating the remaining trapped steam in order to avoid temperature drop in the fresh charge of incoming admission steam.|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} the thesis is the energy saving {{potential}} of digital hydraulic <b>valve</b> controlled <b>drives.</b> Digital hydraulic <b>valves</b> are capable of independent metering of flow paths, enabling reduction of energy losses when compared to traditional 4 / 3 -way control valves with mechanically fixed opening ratio between inflow and outflow control edges. So far independent metering control has been studied using proportional valves with four and five metering edges. In addition to four- and five-edge digital valves, six-edge controlled three-chamber cylinder and four-edge digital valve with pressurized tank line are studied in this thesis and their capability of reducing energy losses is systematically compared.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the {{modeling and simulation}} of a novel electromechanical <b>valve</b> <b>drive</b> known as the MIT EMV. This <b>valve</b> <b>drive</b> allows an engine to achieve variable valve timing which {{has been shown to}} produce improvements in engine fuel efficiency. To test this improvement, a reference engine model with fixed valve timing was obtained from the engine simulation software package WAVE® by Ricardo. A model of the MIT EMV was generated based on the details of the physical actuator, and it was incorporated into the WAVE® engine model. An interface between MATLAB® and WAVE® was developed for simulating the actuator at desired engine speeds and loads. Specific test points were chosen based on corporate operating points and operating points that were used to test the BMW Valvetronic actuator. Through simulation, it was determined that the MIT EMV can provide a reduction of approximately 10 % in fuel consumption at the corporate operating points when compared to the reference engine model. The drive was also able to achieve performance gains similar to the BMW Valvetronic actuator, showing that it is able to compete with other actuators on the market even without variable lift capabilities. by Justin Miller.

The relationship between the rotation of the camshaft and the rotation of the crankshaft is of critically importance.

40|$|In {{traditional}} {{internal combustion}} engines, a camshaft acts on the valve stems {{to open and}} close the valves. Valve timing is fixed relative to piston position. On the other hand, if a valve is flexibly controlled by a variable valve actuation (VVA) system, we can achieve significant improvements in fuel efficiency, engine performance, and emissions. One of the most advanced variable valve actuation systems is the VVA operated by an electromechanical actuator without a camshaft, the so-called bi-positional electromechanical <b>valve</b> <b>drive</b> (EMVD). Existing EMVDs characteristically use a spring to provide the required mechanical power for operating a valve. The use of a spring provides many benefits {{to the design of}} the system, but it also results in difficult design challenges. The large holding force against the spring at the ends of the stroke suggests the use of a normal-force electromagnetic actuator, which, from a servomechanical point of view, is considerably inferior to a shear-force actuator. Furthermore, the large holding force generates a large jerk at {{the beginning and the end}} of a stroke and makes it difficult to achieve soft valve landing. An innovative electromechanical <b>valve</b> <b>drive</b> (EMVD) design is proposed, which incorporates a nonlinear mechanical transformer and a shear-force actuator. This allows not only fast but also smooth valve motion, almost zero seating velocity, zero holding power, and improved control with acceptable electric power. This proposed concept is modeled, analyzed, simulated, designed, and implemented. Experimental results show the beneficial features of the promising proposed concept. by Woo Sok Chang. Thesis (Ph.
