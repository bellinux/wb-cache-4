Elizabeth discovers a golden pirate medallion around his neck, keeping {{it in order}} to protect him. Elizabeth sees a ghost ship <b>vanish</b> <b>into</b> the fog.|$|E
5|$|The Queen (voiced by Susanne Blakeslee) is {{the main}} villain in the 2005 direct-to-video {{animated}} film Once Upon a Halloween, but appears only in the Witch version despite misleading cover art (furthermore, only her shadow is shown). In it, the Queen plots to conquer Halloween and asks her cauldron to show several villains to which one of them helps her in her plan. The cauldron also explains its origins as {{it is one of}} the cauldrons formerly owned by the three witches from The Black Cauldron. Eventually, the cauldron turns against the Wicked Queen and makes her <b>vanish</b> <b>into</b> nothingness.|$|E
25|$|A corpse candle {{or light}} is a flame or ball of light, often blue, that {{is seen to}} travel just above the ground on the route from the {{cemetery}} to the dying person's house and back again, and is particularly associated with Wales. A corpse fire is very similar as the name comes from lights appearing specifically within graveyards where it was believed the lights were an omen of death or coming tragedy and would mark the route of a future funeral, from the victim's house to the graveyard, where it would <b>vanish</b> <b>into</b> {{the ground at the}} site of the burial. The appearance was often said to be on the night before a death.|$|E

25|$|Illustrations of {{theatrical}} masks from 5th century display helmet-like masks, covering the entire face and head, with holes {{for the eyes}} and a small aperture for the mouth, {{as well as an}} integrated wig. These paintings never show actual masks on the actors in performance; they are most often shown being handled by the actors before or after a performance, that liminal space between the audience and the stage, between myth and reality. This demonstrates {{the way in which the}} mask was to 'melt' into the face and allow the actor to <b>vanish</b> <b>into</b> the role. Effectively, the mask transformed the actor as much as memorization of the text. Therefore, performance in ancient Greece did not distinguish the masked actor from the theatrical character.|$|E
25|$|Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often {{center on}} its story {{foremost}} {{as a warning}} against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of <b>vanish</b> <b>into</b> a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} group eventually explores {{all four}} labyrinths, successfully unlocking the {{doors in the}} Velvet Room and restoring Zen's memories. He reveals that his true identity is the human avatar of Chronos, a manifestation of death created by the Collective Unconscious, and Rei is really a girl named Niko who died of illness twelve years prior. When Chronos came to escort her to the afterlife, he was intrigued by her descent into nihilism {{as a result of}} having lived an apparently meaningless life. Chronos created the alternate Yasogami High, split himself into Zen and a powerful being known as the Clockwork God, and sealed both of their memories {{in order to try to}} bring Rei happiness. The Clockwork God is the one responsible for trapping SEES and the Investigation Team in the alternate Yasogami, hoping for them to traverse the labyrinths and recover Zen's memories so they can merge and become Chronos once again: this would result in the teams being erased from time when their tasks were completed. The Clockwork God abducts Rei and transports her to the top of a clock tower outside the school. SEES and the Investigation Team decide to help Zen rescue Rei, and they ascend the tower and defeat the Clockwork God. After spending some carefree time together before the pocket dimension collapses, Zen and Rei <b>vanish</b> <b>into</b> the afterlife, while SEES and the Investigation Team promise to meet again someday and return home, although their memories of the incident are erased.|$|E

500|$|While inside KOS-MOS's memory, {{the group}} are guided through a dream-like realm {{constructed}} from their repressed bad memories, {{all the way}} observed by Nephilim, with whom chaos is acquainted. Shion also meets a vision of Febronia, a Realian woman killed in the Miltian Conflict, who asks Shion to [...] "free" [...] her sisters Cecily and Cathe {{for the sake of}} both humans and Realians. Before fulfilling their mission, Nephilim tells them that KOS-MOS was designed to stop the energies of U-DO from entering their reality, an event which caused the original planet Miltia to <b>vanish</b> <b>into</b> a space-time void and could potentially destroy the universe. Due to surviving a Gnosis encounter and remaining human, Shion has the capacity to change the future for the better. During these events, Albedo captures and psychologically tortures MOMO before triggering the [...] "Song of Nephilim", a song which attracts swarms of Gnosis.|$|E
500|$|Duvall was {{the only}} American actor {{nominated}} for the Best Actor Oscar; his competition were Britons Michael Caine (who had co-starred with Duvall in the 1976 The Eagle Has Landed), Tom Conti, Tom Courtenay and Albert Finney. During an interview before the Oscar ceremony, Duvall offended some Britons by complaining about [...] "the Limey syndrome," [...] claiming [...] "the attitude {{with a lot of}} people in Hollywood is that what they do in England is somehow better than what we do here." [...] Duvall, who was presented with the Oscar by country music star Dolly Parton, said of winning the award, [...] "It was a nice feeling, knowing I was the home-crowd favorite." [...] In a New York Times profile of Duvall that appeared six years after Tender Mercies release, Nan C. Robertson wrote that despite four previous Academy Award nominations, [...] "it was not until he won as Best Actor in 1983 ... that moviegoers woke up in droves to this great natural resource. The reason was that they rarely recognized Mr. Duvall from one part to another, so effortlessly did he <b>vanish</b> <b>into</b> each celluloid persona." [...] Foote, who was so certain he would not win the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for To Kill a Mockingbird he had not attended the 1963 ceremony, made sure he was present to collect his award for Best Original Screenplay. The critical success of the film allowed Foote to exercise considerable control over his future film projects, including final veto power over major decisions; when such power was denied, Foote would simply refuse to do the film.|$|E
500|$|While several {{including}} Robert and his half-brother John {{chose to}} <b>vanish</b> <b>into</b> the night, Catesby, Percy, the Wright brothers, Grant, Rookwood and Thomas remained. [...] Thomas asked {{them what they}} intended to do – [...] "We mean here to die". [...] Thomas replied [...] "I will take such part as you do". [...] Richard Walsh, Sheriff of Worcester, arrived with a vigilante force of about 200men early on 8 November. [...] Thomas {{was the first to}} be hit, in the shoulder, while crossing the courtyard. [...] The Wright brothers were next, followed by Rookwood, still injured from the explosion the night before. [...] Catesby and Percy were dropped by a single lucky shot. [...] The sheriff's men then proceeded to strip the defenders of their valuables, but Thomas was saved by the sheriff's assistant. [...] His fine sword, ordered and paid for four months previously, apparently proved too great a temptation for the Sheriff's men, as it was never seen again. [...] He and the others were taken first to Worcester, and then to the Tower of London. [...] Despite a proclamation of 18 November naming them as wanted men, Robert Wintour and Stephen Litteton managed to evade capture until 9 January 1606. [...] They spent about two months hiding out in barns and houses; at one point they were forced to restrain a drunken poacher who happened upon their hiding place. [...] They were eventually discovered at the house of Humphrey Littleton in Hagley, after a cook, John Finwood, informed on them. [...] Humphrey managed to escape, but was captured at Prestwood, in Staffordshire.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert, {{also of the}} Chicago Sun-Times, gave it two and a {{half out}} of four stars, and called the film a [...] "disappointment" [...] {{compared}} to his recent movies. Jonathan Trout of the BBC said, [...] "Youngsters and Miyazaki fans will coo at the world's depth and rich surreality, but opaque plotting, and a tendency to mope with Sophie whilst Howl is off affecting events let the momentum of the first act <b>vanish</b> <b>into</b> thin air." [...] Writing for Salon, Stephanie Zacharek said, [...] "the plot of [...] "Howl's Moving Castle" [...] meanders so listlessly that its details become less and less charming. Miyazaki's storytelling style resembles that of a breathless young tot who's fearlessly exercising his newfound powers of expression." [...] Stephen Hunter from The Washington Post criticized the plot of the film, saying [...] "There is no story, or rather, there's no force to the story, which meanders almost casually this way and that for no apparent reason." [...] However, he said that the movie also empowered young women, and was [...] "beautiful beyond telling." [...] David Rooney, writing in Variety, stated that [...] "the narrative motor roars ahead in the opening hour and is more erratic thereafter," [...] and suggested that better translation would help. Literary scholar Matt Kimmich stated that the film came across as [...] "uneasy compromise between two plots and two imaginations," [...] referring to Jones' original story and Miyazaki's style of animation and storytelling. However, he stated that those scenes which were not dependent either on Jones' original plot or Miyazaki's added plot threads found [...] "a visual humor that recalls the verbal wit and lightness of Jones's novel," [...] and that the [...] "animation manages to free itself from the demands of the two plots—and flies." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Born This Way, season ten American Idol {{contestant}} Haley Reinhart sang [...] "You and I" [...] as one of two performances for the [...] "Songs from Now and Then" [...] episode. Jimmy Iovine, head of Gaga's record label, asked for the song and Reinhart received her permission before the performance. Reviews of Reinhart's performance were mostly positive. Len Melisurgo of The Star-Ledger considered it a risky choice, since the song had not been released, but accepted that Reinhart [...] "sounded amazing" [...] by hitting [...] "some really high notes". Brian Mansfield of USA Today described Reinhart's performance as an [...] "old-fashioned dance-hall groove, kind of like a mid-'70s Elton John number. It's perfectly suited to that slippery growl that such a distinctive part of Haley's style. By the end of the song, she turns it into a gospel-style rocker, and she takes it to the house." [...] Mansfield also noted that the American Idol judges—Randy Jackson, Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler—reacted positively to it. On the contrary, Jim Farber of the New York Daily News considered the choice risky and was thankful when Reinhart performed a more familiar song for her second round. On May 5, 2011, Reinhart's studio recording of [...] "You and I" [...] was released as a digital single to the iTunes Store, and appeared on the compilation album American Idol Top 5 Season 10. Mansfield, who initially had misgivings about Reinhart as a singer, complimented her studio recording of the track, feeling that if she could [...] "get another 10 songs this good {{when it comes time to}} cut the record, then all my initial misgivings about this girl will <b>vanish</b> <b>into</b> thin air." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Graeco-Roman world, {{practitioners}} of magic {{were known as}} magi (singular magus), a [...] "foreign" [...] title of Persian priests. Apuleius, defending himself against accusations of casting magic spells, defined the magician as [...] "in popular tradition (more vulgari)... someone who, because of his community of speech with the immortal gods, has an incredible power of spells (vi cantaminum) for everything he wishes to." [...] Pliny the Elder offers a thoroughly skeptical [...] "History of magical arts" [...] from their supposed Persian origins to Nero's vast and futile expenditure on research into magical practices {{in an attempt to}} control the gods. Philostratus takes pains {{to point out that the}} celebrated Apollonius of Tyana was definitely not a magus, [...] "despite his special knowledge of the future, his miraculous cures, and his ability to <b>vanish</b> <b>into</b> thin air".|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, in Rohan, King Théoden and his Rohirrim are {{recovering}} from the Battle of the Hornburg, in which they defended Rohan {{against the forces of}} Saruman at great cost. On their way back from Isengard, Aragorn, the king, and his company are met by the Company of Rangers from Arnor in the north (the [...] "Grey Company"), led by Elladan and Elrohir, the sons of Elrond, and Halbarad, a leader of Rangers from the North. [...] They had answered the summons of Galadriel to join Aragorn in his cause. [...] When they return to Hornburg, Aragorn informs the king that he shall not ride with the Rohirrim, having confronted Sauron through the palantír (seeing-stone) of Isengard. [...] Instead, able to see a new threat to Gondor, he decides to go travel the Paths of the Dead and find the lost army of the undead oathbreakers who dwell under the Dwimorberg, the Haunted Mountain. [...] These spirits were cursed because they did not help Isildur during the War of the Last Alliance. Helped by his companions Legolas and Gimli as well as the Grey Company, they ride to Dunharrow. [...] When they arrive, Éowyn, tries to dissuade Aragorn from going and then—desperate to stay with him—tries to go as well. [...] Aragorn cannot release Éowyn from her duties and cannot return the love she has for him and reluctantly sets out the next morning to recruit the Army of the Dead to his cause. The company then passes under the Haunted Mountain where they come across the bones of a missing prince of Rohan, who had foolishly ventured on the Paths of the Dead. [...] The company then comes out {{on the other side of}} the mountain into the valley of the Morthond River in Gondor and then proceed to the Stone of Erech. [...] There, the Oathbreakers gather around the Grey Company in the middle of the night and resolve to fulfil their oath. [...] They all then ride east to the great port of Pelargir and <b>vanish</b> <b>into</b> the storm of Mordor.|$|E
