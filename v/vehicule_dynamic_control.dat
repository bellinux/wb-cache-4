A simplified dynamic model is used for the H 4 robot to decrease the cost of computation. A dynamic simulation is performed using ADAMSTM. In addition, the adept motion is used as a benchmark test to evaluate the effect of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>control.</b> The simulation results show that the <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> dramatically improves the trajectory tracking accuracy...|$|R

A numerical simulation of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> process in an AO system is carried {{out for the first}} time to complete a comprehensive numerical simulation of an AO system. By means of the numerical simulation the long-exposure Strehl ratio and other useful metrics for evaluating the performances of an AO system can be obtained. In comparison to the theoretical analyses of automatic control theory, a numerical simulation of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> process in an AO system is advantageous. The frequency response characteristics are closely related to the <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> performance of an AO system. The bandwidth, phase margin and gain margin which are very important parameters for experimenters can be obtained conveniently from a numerical simulation of the frequency response characteristics. A numerical simulation of the frequency response characteristics in an AO system is presented in this paper for the first time. The numerical simulation results agree with the experimental data excellently. The simulation computational results of frequency response by using composite input of multiple frequencies compare to the single-frequency simulation results very well and can be used to determine the practical parameters of bandwidth and margins. The performances of an AO system can be effectively investigated by means of a combination of a numerical simulation of frequency response characteristics with that of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> process...|$|R

In {{order to}} improve the pump {{efficiency}} of pumping wells, {{by means of the}} basic formula of pump efficiency, the mathematical model and boundary conditions of <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> chart is obtained, and the pump efficiency of pumping wells is drawn. Analysis shown that the pump efficiency is sensitive to the water content and pump leak rate. The higher the water content is, the higher pump efficiency is. The pump efficiency will be reduced with the increasing of pump leak rate. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> chart of class II block of A oilfield is given in the paper.

Most of the existing cobots use steering wheels; typical drawbacks of using steering wheels include the difficulties to (i) follow a trajectory with a curvature larger {{than that of the}} base platform, (ii) mount encoders on steering wheels due to self-spinning of the wheels, and (iii) quarantine <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> performance since it is purely kinematic control.

40|$|Software bugs {{comprise}} {{the greatest threat}} to computer security today. Though enormous effort has been expended on eliminating security exploits, contemporary testing techniques are insufficient to deliver software free of security vulnerabilities. In this paper we propose a novel approach to security vulnerability analysis: <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> frontier profiling. Security exploits are often buried in rarely executed code paths hidden just beyond the path space explored by end-users. Therefore, we develop Schnauzer, a distributed sampling technology to discover the <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> frontier, which forms the line of demarcation between dynamically executed and unseen paths. This frontier may then be used to direct tools (such as white-box fuzz testers) to attain a level of testing coverage currently unachievable. We further demonstrate that the <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> frontier paths are a rich source of security bugs, sensitizing many known security exploits. 1...|$|R
40|$|Capturing <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> {{dependence}} {{is critical}} for many dynamic program analysis such as dynamic slicing, dynamic information flow, and data lineage computation. Existing algorithms are mostly a simple runtime translation of the static definition, which fails to capture certain dynamic properties by its nature, leading to inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel online detection technique for <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> dependence. The technique is based upon a new definition, which {{is equivalent to the}} existing one in the intraprocedural case but it enables an efficient detection algorithm. The new algorithm naturally and efficiently handles interprocedural <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> dependence even in presence of irregular control flow. Our evaluation shows that the detection algorithm slows down program execution by a factor of 2. 57, which is 2. 54 times faster than the existing algorithm that was used in prior work...|$|R

40|$|In most {{industrial}} systems, {{people not}} only work as individuals, {{but also a}} member of one or more teams. This research investigates the effect of human mental workload and metacognition between an individual and team-based <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> task. Although advanced technology provides the ability to develop more effective training approaches to inexperienced workers, building effective team training methods is an unremitting research area. In this research, a human-in-the-loop simulation experiment was conducted to compare human mental workload between individual-based and team-based groups and to reveal the relationship between metacognition and human mental workload. Within the Anti-Air warfare Coordinator (AAWC) simulation domain, the experimental group was exposed to a team-based environment, while the control group conducted the same task in an individual-based environment. Our results show that different metacognitive monitoring processes exist between team-based and individual-based <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> tasks. Based on these, we suggest a possible metacognitive framework in <b>dynamic</b> <b>control</b> tasks...|$|R
