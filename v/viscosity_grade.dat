The matrix tablets were prepared by direct compression process. The prepared tablets were evaluated for various physico chemical parameters. In vitro drug release study was carried out in simulated gastric fluid (0. 1 N HCl) for the first 2 h and in phosphate buffer (pH 6. 8) for the next 6 h following USP 25 paddle method. Increase in Eudragit L 100 - 55 and HPMC concentrations or increase in <b>viscosity</b> <b>grades</b> of HPMC polymers (Methocel E 50 and Methocel K 15 M CR) resulted in a significant decrease in Ranolazine release. For instance, the matrix tablets containing 15 % of polymers shows delayed and extended drug release when compared to 10 % polymers irrespective of <b>viscosity</b> <b>grades</b> of HPMC in the tablet. Further, the drug release from Eudragit L 100 - 55 and higher HPMC <b>viscosity</b> <b>grades</b> (Methocel K 15 M) was slower as compared to lower <b>viscosity</b> <b>grades</b> (Methocel E 50). The in vitro data is fitted in to different kinetic models and the best-fit was achieved with the Higuchi model followed by the zero-order plot, Korsmeyer and Hixson Crowell equations.

Hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) of different <b>viscosity</b> <b>grades</b> at three different drug to polymer ratios were used to prepare HBS by wet granulation technique. The prepared HBS tablets were evaluated in terms of their pre-compression parameters, physical characteristics like hardness, friability, uniformity of weight, uniformity of drug content, swelling index, drug polymer interaction studies, invitro floating studies, invitro drug release and short term stability studies. The drug polymer ratio, <b>viscosity</b> <b>grades</b> of HPMC, different diluents and gas generating agents were found to influence the drug release and floating properties of the prepared HBS. The floating properties and drug release characteristics were determined for the prepared HBS in 0. 1 N HCl dissolution media.

40|$|Orally {{disintegrating}} tablets (ODTs) {{which are}} {{also referred to as}} orodispersible and fast disintegrating tablets, are solid oral dosage forms which upon placing on the tongue, disperse/disintegrate rapidly before being swallowed as a suspension or solution. ODTs are therefore easier and more convenient to administer than conventional tablets and are particularly beneficial for paediatric and geriatric patients, who generally have difficulty swallowing their medication. The work presented in this thesis involved the formulation and process development of ODTs, prepared using freeze-drying. Gelatin is one of the principal excipients used in the formulation of freeze-dried ODTs. One of the studies presented in this thesis investigated the potential modification of the properties of this excipient, in order to improve the performance of the tablets. As gelatin is derived from animal sources, a number of ethical issues surround its use as an excipient in pharmaceutical preparations. This was one of the motivations, Methocel™ and Kollicoat® IR were evaluated as binders as alternative materials to gelatin. Polyox™ was also evaluated as a binder together with its potential uses as a viscosity increasing and mucoadhesive agent to increase the retention of tablets in the mouth to encourage pre-gastric absorption of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The in vitro oral retention of freeze-dried ODT formulations was one property which was assessed in a design of experiments – factorial design study, which was carried out to further understand the role that formulation excipients have on the properties of the tablets. Finally, the novel approach of incorporating polymeric nanoparticles in freeze-dried ODTs was investigated, to study if the release profile of APIs could be modified, which could improve their therapeutic effect. The results from these studies demonstrated that the properties of gelatin-based formulations can be modified by adjusting pH and ionic strength. Adjustment of formulation pH has shown to significantly reduce tablet disintegration time. Evaluating Methocel™, in particular low <b>viscosity</b> <b>grades,</b> and Kollicoat® IR as binders has shown that these polymers can form tablets of satisfactory hardness and disintegration time.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of the pore structure in pharmaceutical coatings is crucial for understanding and controlling mass transport properties and function in controlled drug release. Since the drug release rate {{can be associated with}} the film permeability, the effect of the pore structure on the permeability is important to study. In this paper, a new approach for characterizing the pore structure in polymer blended films was developed based on an image processing procedure for given two-dimensional scanning electron microscopy images of film cross-sections. The focus was on different measures for characterizing the complexity of the shape of a pore. The pore characterization developed was applied to ethyl cellulose (EC) and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) blended films, often used as pharmaceutical coatings, where HPC acts as the pore former. It was studied how two different HPC viscosity grades influence the pore structure and, hence, mass transport through the respective films. The film with higher HPC <b>viscosity</b> <b>grade</b> had been observed to be more permeable than the other in a previous study; however, experiments had failed to show a difference between their pore structures. By instead characterizing the pore structures using tools from image analysis, statistically significant differences in pore area fraction and pore shape were identified. More specifically, {{it was found that the}} more permeable film with higher HPC <b>viscosity</b> <b>grade</b> seemed to have more extended and complex pore shapes than the film with lower HPC <b>viscosity</b> <b>grade.</b> This result indicates a greater degree of connectivity in the film with higher permeability and statistically confirms hypotheses on permeability from related experimental studies...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{investigations}} of aqueous based ethyl cellulose (EC) latex dispersions have mainly {{focused on the}} commercially available <b>viscosity</b> <b>grade</b> 20  cps. In this study, dispersions of EC with varying viscosity grades (which correspond to molecular weights), ranging from 4 to 100 cps, were produced and characterised. The dispersions showed particle sizes around 200  nm and highly negative ?-potentials (approx. ? 100  mV), which indicated stable dispersions as confirmed by sedimentation studies. The different latexes were used to produce free-standing film coatings. We hypothesised that the different viscosity grades of EC would result in different properties of the films. We found that an increase in <b>viscosity</b> <b>grade</b> (and higher molecular weight) resulted in lower coalescence between the particles during film formation and thus to higher water permeability than in film coatings of lower molecular weight. After exposure to water the EC 4  cps and 20  cps film coatings had a more porous structure in the side facing the air during production and drying after immersion in water. Molecular weight is therefore a factor {{that should be considered}} when producing pharmaceutical coatings for controlled release...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to develop sustained release matrix pellets of Lamivudine, using various <b>viscosity</b> <b>grades</b> of hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose as retardant polymers The pellets were prepared by extrusion spheronization technique. The pellets were evaluated for angle of repose, bulk density, compressibility index and hausners ratio and in vitro drug release studies. The pellets showed satisfactory flow properties, compressibility. The results of in vitro dissolution studies indicated that formulation F 8 is the most successful formulation of the study and exhibited highest drug release in the initial hours and the total release pattern was very close to the theoretical release profile of pellets. The rate of drug release decreased with increased polymer concentration. It was found that HPMC viscosity had a significant impact on the drug release from the prepared sustained release matrix pellets. Th...|$|R
40|$|Polyox Water Soluble Resins (CAS No. 25322 - 68 - 3) are high-molecular-weightpolymers of {{ethylene}} oxide ina variety of <b>viscosity</b> <b>grades.</b> They {{are widely used}} in cosmetic formulations, as phar-maceutical excipients, and food contact applications. The potential for absorptionand long-termtoxicity (including oncogenicity) from peroral dosing was investigated using an N- 10 grade with an av-erage molecular weight of about 100, 000 daltons. A subchronic (13 -week) toxicity study with up to 3 % Polyox N- 10 in the diet of Fischer 344 rats showed slight increases in food consumption, body weight, and body weight gain. A dose-related increase in liver weight was observed, {{but this was not}} associated with any histopathology, and morphometric analysis showed no alteration in the number or size of the hepatocytes. Because of the lack of correlative pathology ndings, the liver weight increase was con-sidered not to be deleterious, but a secondary response to increase...|$|R
40|$|Mucoadhesive tablets of {{diltiazem}} hydrochloride were formulated as matrix tablets employing, {{polyethylene oxide}} (Polyox) and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) and were investigated for mucoadhesion and drug release behavior. Tablets formulated using different <b>viscosity</b> <b>grades</b> of Polyox showed the drug release decreased with viscosity of Polyox increased. Tablet prepared with Polyox alone were slowly eroded and were dissolved completely within 6 - 10 hours. The mucoadhesive {{strength of the}} matrices increased with increase in polymer content. When HPMC was incorporated, the tablets remained intact and provided slow release of diltiazem for over 12 hr. A 3 2 full factorial design was conducted to optimized the formulation. The kinetic modeling study of all batches was shown anomalous pattern of drug release. The drug was released by both erosion and diffusion mechanism. Thus the developed formulation can be suitable for targeted delivery of diltiazem in upper part of GI tract where the absorption of diltiazem is more confined...|$|R
