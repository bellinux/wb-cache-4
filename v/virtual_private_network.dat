25|$|This is {{also the}} layer where packets may be {{selected}} to be sent over a <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> <b>network</b> or other networking tunnel. In this scenario, the link layer data may be considered application data which traverses another instantiation of the IP stack for transmission or reception over another IP connection. Such a connection, or virtual link, may be established with a transport protocol or even an application scope protocol {{that serves as a}} tunnel in the link layer of the protocol stack.

25|$|The Internet allows {{computer}} users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with computer security, i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, {{depending on the}} requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can audit the books of a company based in another country, on a server situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before {{the widespread use of}} the Internet, but the cost of private leased lines would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps {{on the other side of}} the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using cloud computing, or open a remote desktop session into their office PC using a secure <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> <b>network</b> (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among system administrators as the Virtual Private Nightmare, because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.|$|E

At the same time, both technologies provide {{the ability to}} realise <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> <b>networks.</b> The aim {{of this article is}} to identify an optimal solution which provides a compromise between resilience time and network cost for different network models according to the network layer on which the different resilience schemes are implemented and the network layer on which <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> <b>networks</b> are realised. Extended mathematical models for individual network layers for optimization are proposed to compare the different network models with the ASON network architecture. We prove that the optimal network topology applies hot standby path protection and <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> <b>networks</b> on the IP/MPLS network layer. The DWDM network layer is in this case used as a pure transport platform...|$|R
