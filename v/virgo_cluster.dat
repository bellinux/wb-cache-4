5|$|The Milky Way {{galaxy is}} a member of an {{association}} named the Local Group, a relatively small group of galaxies that has a diameter of approximately onemegaparsec. The Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are the two brightest galaxies within the group; many of the other member galaxies are dwarf companions of these two galaxies. The Local Group itself is a part of a cloud-like structure within the Virgo Supercluster, a large, extended structure of groups and clusters of galaxies centered on the <b>Virgo</b> <b>Cluster.</b> And the Virgo Supercluster itself {{is a part of the}} Pisces-Cetus Supercluster Complex, a giant galaxy filament.|$|E
5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble categorized M87 {{as one of}} {{the brighter}} globular nebulae, as it lacked any spiral structure, but appeared to belong to the same family of non-galactic nebulae as spiral nebulae. In 1926 he produced a new categorization of nebulae, with M87 being classified as a type of elliptical extra-galactic nebula with no apparent elongation (class E0). By 1931, Hubble had identified M87 {{as a member of the}} <b>Virgo</b> <b>Cluster,</b> for which he gave a provisional estimate of 1.8 million parsecs from Earth. At the time it was the only known example of an elliptical nebula for which individual stars could be resolved. M87 continued to be called an extragalactic nebula for many years thereafter, but by 1956 it had been identified as an E0-type galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Hubble {{has helped}} resolve some long-standing {{problems}} in astronomy, {{as well as}} raising new questions. Some results have required new theories to explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to Cepheid variable stars more accurately than ever before, and thus constrain {{the value of the}} Hubble constant, the measure of {{the rate at which the}} universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the <b>Virgo</b> <b>Cluster</b> and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of ±10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques. The estimated age is now about 13.7 billion years, but before the Hubble Telescope scientists predicted an age ranging from 10 to 20 billion years.|$|E
5|$|For galaxies {{more distant}} than the Local Group {{and the nearby}} <b>Virgo</b> <b>Cluster,</b> but within a {{thousand}} megaparsecs or so, the redshift is approximately proportional to the galaxy's distance. This correlation was first observed by Edwin Hubble and {{has come to be}} known as Hubble's law. Vesto Slipher was the first to discover galactic redshifts, in about the year 1912, while Hubble correlated Slipher's measurements with distances he measured by other means to formulate his Law. In the widely accepted cosmological model based on general relativity, redshift is mainly a result of the expansion of space: this means that the farther away a galaxy is from us, the more the space has expanded in the time since the light left that galaxy, so the more the light has been stretched, the more redshifted the light is, and so the faster it appears to be moving away from us. Hubble's law follows in part from the Copernican principle. Because it is usually not known how luminous objects are, measuring the redshift is easier than more direct distance measurements, so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble's law.|$|E
5|$|French {{astronomer}} Charles Messier discovered M87 in 1781, cataloguing it as a nebulous feature while {{searching for}} objects that would confuse comet hunters. The second brightest galaxy within the northern <b>Virgo</b> <b>Cluster,</b> M87 is located about 16.4 million parsecs (53.5 million light-years) from Earth. Unlike a disk-shaped spiral galaxy, M87 has no distinctive dust lanes. Instead, {{it has an}} almost featureless, ellipsoidal shape typical of most giant elliptical galaxies, diminishing in luminosity with distance from the centre. Forming around one sixth of M87's mass, the stars in this galaxy have a nearly spherically symmetric distribution, their density decreasing with increasing distance from the core. At the core is an active supermassive black hole, which forms the primary component of an active galactic nucleus. This object is a strong source of multiwavelength radiation, particularly radio waves. M87's galactic envelope extends out to a radius of about 150 kiloparsecs (490,000 light-years), {{where it has been}} truncated—possibly by an encounter with another galaxy. Between the stars is a diffuse interstellar medium of gas that has been chemically enriched by elements emitted from evolved stars.|$|E

M85 is interacting with the spiral galaxy NGC 4394 and the elliptical galaxy MCG-3-32-38. M88 (NGC 4501) is a multi-arm spiral galaxy seen at about 30° from edge-on. It has a highly-regular shape with well-developed, symmetrical arms. Among the first galaxies recognized as spiral, it has a supermassive black hole in its center. M91 (NGC 4548), a barred spiral galaxy with a bright, diffuse nucleus, is the faintest object in Messier's catalog at magnitude 10.2. M98 (NGC 4192), a bright, elongated spiral galaxy seen nearly edge-on, appears elliptical because of its unusual angle. The magnitude-10 galaxy has no redshift. M99 (NGC 4254) is a spiral galaxy seen face-on. Like M98 it is of magnitude-10 and has an unusually long arm on its west side. M100 (NGC 4321), a magnitude-nine spiral galaxy seen face-on, is one of the cluster's brightest.

25|$|Radio galaxies, and to {{a lesser}} extent, radio-loud quasars display a wide range of {{structures}} in radio maps.

A significant minority of low-luminosity sources exhibit structures usually known as plumes which are much more elongated. Some radio galaxies show one or two long narrow features known as jets (the most famous example being the giant galaxy M87 in the <b>Virgo</b> <b>cluster)</b> coming directly from the nucleus and going to the lobes. Since the 1970s, the most widely accepted model has been that the lobes or plumes are powered by beams of high-energy particles and magnetic field coming from close to the active nucleus.

500|$|This supergiant {{elliptical}} galaxy is {{located near the}} center of the <b>Virgo</b> <b>Cluster.</b> This rich cluster has about 2,000 members and it forms the core of the larger Virgo Supercluster, of which the Local Group, and hence the Milky Way galaxy, is an outlying member.

There is a preponderance of elliptical and S0 galaxies around M87, with a chain of elliptical galaxies aligned with the jet. In terms of mass, M87 is a dominant member of the cluster, and hence appears to be moving very little relative to the cluster as a whole. Indeed, M87 is defined as the cluster center.
