40|$|AbstractExperiments that {{involved}} the testing of different steel samples {{over a wide range}} of loads were conducted in order to investigate the influence of micro-loads on accuracy of Vickers microindentation hardness testing. We found that for the same material the <b>Vickers</b> <b>microhardness</b> decreases with the decreasing of test load. The measuring error of <b>Vickers</b> <b>microhardness</b> on a steel block sample with known hardness was - 25 % when we used 10 gf load force.
