50|$|The scooter was {{originally}} {{powered by the}} 175cc ČZ two-stroke single-cylinder motorcycle engine, giving {{a top speed of}} 55 mph and economy of 3.2 litres/100km. The engine was modified for the enclosed scooter by having a drive pulley on the crankshaft driving a fan by means of a <b>Vee</b> <b>belt.</b> There were four foot-operated gears.|$|E
50|$|These are {{for example}} a {{dumbwaiter}} (elevator), electrical night storage heaters and a lobster tank with, at this time, new air supply. The old mechanical tower clock {{was developed and}} constructed by Perrot (Calw). Later the clock gets a rare electro mechanical addition. It combines chime works and winch with two electric motors. The mechanical circuit is steered by a mercury switch. The power transmission is made by a <b>vee</b> <b>belt</b> and is still working today.|$|E
50|$|The Spitfire Mark I was {{a utility}} {{helicopter}} {{built in the}} United States in the late 1970s and intended for series production. In essence, the Mark I was an Enstrom F-28 that was modified to use an Allison 250 turboshaft engine and geared transmission {{in place of the}} original piston engine and system of <b>vee</b> <b>belts.</b> The resulting powerplant installation was lighter and more compact, which allowed for additional cargo or fuel.|$|R
5000|$|V belts (also style V-belts, <b>vee</b> <b>belts,</b> or, less commonly, wedge rope) {{solved the}} {{slippage}} and alignment problem. It {{is now the}} basic belt for power transmission. They provide the best combination of traction, speed of movement, load of the bearings, and long service life. They are generally endless, and their general cross-section shape is roughly trapezoidal (hence the name [...] "V"). The [...] "V" [...] shape of the belt tracks in a mating groove in the pulley (or sheave), {{with the result that}} the belt cannot slip off. The belt also tends to wedge into the groove as the load increases—the greater the load, the greater the wedging action—improving torque transmission and making the V-belt an effective solution, needing less width and tension than flat belts. V-belts trump flat belts with their small center distances and high reduction ratios. The preferred center distance is larger than the largest pulley diameter, but less than three times the sum of both pulleys. Optimal speed range is [...] V-belts need larger pulleys for their thicker cross-section than flat belts.|$|R
