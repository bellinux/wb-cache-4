In this report we introduce a <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> <b>software,</b> which seamlessly integrates mobile with stationary users into fully distributed multi-party conversations.

40|$|In a {{traditional}} network stack, data from an application is transmitted {{in the order}} that it is received.

This algorithm is implemented as an interface to DCCP and tested using traffic modelled on <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> <b>software.</b> The results show improvement can be made to <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> during periods of congestion - substantially more audio packets arrive on time with the algorithm, which leads to higher quality <b>video</b> <b>conferencing.</b> In many cases video packet arrival rate also increases and adopting the algorithm gives improvements to <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> that are better than using unmodified queuing for DCCP.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{adaptable}} features in a <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> system {{and how they}} can be tuned to preserve video quality when the network performance degrades. We present the implementation of two such features [...] resolution reduction and frame resizing [...] in an existing <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> <b>software</b> called NV developed at Xerox PARC. The savings in transmission time for a video frame with reduced resolution and size are offset by the extra CPU overhead in generating this frame.

We show empirically how the encoding and decoding time of processing a frame are affected by resizing and resolution reduction. 1 Introduction <b>Video</b> <b>conferencing</b> systems (VCS) have become practical in commercial and research institutions because of the advances of technologies in networking and multimedia applications [Vet 95].

40|$|With {{advances}} in VLSI technology, {{it is now}} possible to implement vector processors on a single chip. Vector architectures are ideal for providing the cost-effective, real-time performance demanded by graphicintensive applications such as MPEG players and <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> <b>software.</b> However, these vector microprocessors lack compilers and instead rely on libraries of hand-written assembly functions that use their vector hardware.

In this paper, we describe how we augmented SUIF and discuss which aspects of SUIF were or were not needed for the retargeting effort.

40|$|Different coding/decoding {{schemes for}} video frames require {{different}} amount of CPU processing overheads, {{and result in}} different amount of frame data compression. In this paper, we study the performance of alternative codec schemes as supported in a <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> <b>software</b> called NV. We present the concept of momentum which {{is the number of}} blocks in video frame whose contents have been changed since the display of the last video frame. As many codec schemes use only differentials (i. e. the difference between the current video frame and the last video frame coded) for coding a frame, momentum affects the performance of codec schemes significantly as verified by our experiments. Lossy compression of images results in lower quality, smaller size of images. Some of the information in the image is lost but because of the smaller size there is a decrease of communication delay in retrieving that image.

This paper provides a case study in the selection of <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> services by the Flinders University Telehealth in the Home trial (FTH Trial) to support healthcare in the home. Using pragmatic methods, <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> solutions available on the market were assessed for usability, reliability, cost, compatibility, interoperability, performance and privacy considerations. The process of elimination through which the eventual solution was chosen, the selection criteria used for each requirement and the corresponding results are described.

40|$|International audienceContext: Testing highly-configurable {{software}} {{systems is}} challenging {{due to a}} large number of test configurations that have to be carefully selected {{in order to reduce the}} testing effort as much as possible, while maintaining high software quality. Finding the smallest set of valid test configurations that ensure sufficient coverage of the system's feature interactions is thus the objective of validation engineers, especially when the execution of test configurations is costly or time-consuming. However, this problem is NP-hard in general and approximation algorithms have often been used to address it in practice. Objective: In this paper, we explore an alternative approach based on constraint programming that will allow engineers to increase the effectiveness of configuration testing while keeping the number of configurations as low as possible. Method: Our approach consists in using a (time-aware) minimisation algorithm based on constraint programming. Given the amount of time, our solution generates a minimised set of valid test configurations that ensure coverage of all pairs of feature values (a. k. a. pairwise coverage). The approach has been implemented in a tool called PACOGEN. Results: PACOGEN was evaluated on 224 feature models in comparison with the two existing tools that are based on a greedy algorithm. For 79 % of 224 feature models, PACOGEN generated up to 60 % fewer test configurations than the competitor tools. We further evaluated PACOGEN in the case study of large industrial highly-configurable <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> <b>software</b> with a feature model of 169 features, and found 60 % fewer configurations compared with the manual approach followed by test engineers. The set of test configurations generated by PACOGEN decreased the time required by test engineers in manual test configuration by 85 %, increasing the feature-pairs coverage at the same time. Conclusion: Extensive evaluation concluded that optimal minimisation of pairwise-covering test configurations is efficiently addressed using constraint programming techniques...|$|R
