The aim of {{our study}} was to test the possibility of detailed human embryonic biometry using a virtual reality (VR) technique. Methods In a longitudinal study, three-dimensional (3 D) measurements were performed from 6 to 14 weeks gestational age in 32 pregnancies (n = 16 spontaneous conception, n = 16 IVF/ICSI). A total of 125 3 D volumes were analysed in the I-Space VR system, which allows binocular depth perception, providing a realistic 3 D illusion. Crown-rump length (CRL), biparietal diameter (BPD), occipito-frontal diameter (OFD), head circumference (HC) and abdominal circumference (AC) were measured as well as arm length, shoulder width, elbow width, hip width and knee width. Result SCRL, BPD, OFD and HC could be measured in more than 96 of patients, and AC in 78. Shoulder width, elbow width, hip width and knee width could be measured in more than 95 of cases, and arm length in 82 of cases.

A previous research culminated in the description of the plant model; it called for important morphological modifications, but the most prominent involved the transfer of the site of grain production from a lateral position to the apex of the plant, associated with the complete suppression of the tassel. A mutant was also identified as a potential source to develop the ideotype. To decide on the suitability of this genetic material, several experiments were designed to characterize its morphology and to obtain information on the genetic nature of the different plant attributes associated with it;In average, the typical mutant plant was 85 cm tall, with 27 to 30 leaves from which 18 to 20 remained functional at maturity. It developed one or more apical female inflorescences; a tassel was usually present although suppressed at <b>variable</b> degrees. <b>Ears</b> were small, with few rows and gram. Gram yield per plain was low (+/- 30 g). Lateral ear shoots frequently appeared. Little improvement in the level of expression of these plant attributes was accomplished after backcrossing, possibly because of an undesirable linkage between the presence of apical ears and a short, leafy plant;Preliminary evidence suggested that the apical ear characteristic may be a threshold trait. Generation mean analysis indicated that penetrance of the trait was controlled by additive, dominance, additive x additive and additive x dominance gene effects. Models including one to three digenic epistatic effects explained the inheritance of other plant attributes. Information from a biparental progenies experiment revealed that in the population derived from the maintenance of the mutant, genetic variation existed for most traits, although its magnitude was small;It is concluded that some selection could be practiced in the mutant population, but that the most recommendable course of action is to continue with the backcross process and to explore new germplasm sources...|$|R

However, we did not find any sequence variation, pointing out that a larger sample size will be needed to map and identify a modifier.

INTRODUCTION: Many mammals have evolved highly adapted hearing associated with ecological specialisation. Of these, bats possess the widest frequency range of vocalisations and associated hearing sensitivities, with frequencies of above 200 kHz in some lineages that use laryngeal echolocation. High frequency hearing in bats appears to have evolved via structural modifications of the inner ear, however, studying these minute features presents considerable challenges and hitherto few such attempts have been made. To understand these adaptations more fully, as well as gain insights into the evolutionary origins of ultrasonic hearing and echolocation in bats, we undertook micro-computed tomography (Î¼CT) scans of the cochleae of representative bat species from 16 families, encompassing their broad range of ecological diversity. To characterise cochlear gross morphology, we measured the relative basilar membrane length and number of turns, and compared these values between echolocating and non-echolocating bats, as well as other mammals. RESULTS: We found that hearing and echolocation call frequencies in bats correlated with both measures of cochlear morphology. In particular, relative basilar membrane length was typically longer in echolocating species, and also correlated positively with the number of cochlear turns. Ancestral reconstructions of these parameters suggested that the common ancestor of all extant bats was probably capable of ultrasonic hearing; however, we also found evidence of a significant decrease in the rate of morphological evolution of the basilar membrane in multiple ancestral branches within the Yangochiroptera suborder. Within the echolocating Yinpterochiroptera, there was some evidence of an increase in the rate of basilar membrane evolution in some tips of the tree, possibly associated with reported shifts in call frequency associated with recent speciation events. CONCLUSIONS: The two main groups of echolocating bat were found to display highly <b>variable</b> inner <b>ear</b> morphologies. Ancestral reconstructions and rate shift analyses of ear morphology point to a complex evolutionary history, with the former supporting ultrasonic hearing in the common bat ancestor but the latter suggesting that morphological changes associated with echolocation might have occurred later. These findings are consistent with theories that sophisticated laryngeal echolocation, as seen in modern lineages, evolved following the divergence of the two main suborders...|$|R

In McElveen's experimental results [34], blocking the aditus decreased transmission in two bones and increased transmission in one bone. The effects were small between results. Because of the small numbers of bone studies and the individual variations between bones, any conclusion about the clinical significance of the temporal bone results might be cautiously. The real results could be affected by confounding <b>variables</b> including middle <b>ear</b> injury, stiffness of TM, and the mobility status of the ossicular chains. Therefore, more large numbers of temporal bone studies should be needed. Some small peaks in umbo displacement were noted in McElveen's results. According to umbo and stapes displacement measurements in temporal bones and living humans, in some 30 % of ears, the tympanic membrane (TM) does not produce a smooth frequency response over the important hearing frequencies [37]. Goode [38] reported that measurements of umbo displacement for a constant sound pressure level (SPL) at the TM in 22 frequencies between 200 and 6000 [*]Hz showed peaks and valleys of more than 10 [*]dB. This is possibly the result of previous injuries, both major and minor, to the TM, and perhaps to the ossicles [38]. Our FE model curve is lower than the experimental curve; however, the trend was similar to the experimental curve. The difference between the FE model and the experimental data may also result from the variations of individual temporal bone.|$|R
40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: Aural {{fullness}} is {{a frequent}} symptom of endolymphatic hydrops, Its evaluation may provide valuable information on the initial stage of development of endolymphatic hydrops. Study Design: The present investigation was specifically designed to ascertain {{the ability of the}} glycerol test, combined with pure tone audiometry and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) testing, to diagnose endolymphatic hydrops early and to identify patients who may evolve toward Meniere's disease. For these purposes, patients who complained about aural fullness as their only audiologic symptom were selected, Methods: This investigation consisted of 19 consecutive patients with unilateral or bilateral aural fullness who received no treatment. Each patient underwent glycerol testing measured with conventional pure tone audiometry and with both DPOAEs, For the traditional pure-tone glycerol test, a hearing improvement of at least 10 dB, at the lower two or three frequencies (125, 250, and 500 Hz), was judged as a positive result. For the DPOAE glycerol test, a smaller positive difference (5 dB) for at least three frequencies was interpreted as an ameliorative fluctuation. Results: The outcomes of the glycerol tests (24 <b>ears</b> examined) showed <b>variable</b> patterns. Seven <b>ears</b> showed no significant changes of either the pure-tone audiogram or DPOAE. In seven other ears, the comparison of the traditional glycerol test and the DPOAE glycerol test indicated an improvement in both measures. Another seven ears showed negative glycerol tests, whereas DPOAE: responses gradually recovered reaching levels significantly higher than those recorded before glycerol administration. The three remaining ears showed contrasting results. Conclusions: Patients with aural fullness in the absence of other associated symptoms may potentially be in the initial stages of Meniere's disease. This notion is confirmed by the present findings showing a high rate (58 %) of positive glycerol tests in the selected patients, The importance of DPOAE testing is supported by their ability to detect minimal dysfunction, possibly representing endolymphatic hydrops that goes undetected by routine pure-tone audiometry...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} different quantization methods in speech coding. Variable rate quantization {{has the potential}} to substantially reduce the bit rate requirements in speech coding. Due to the highly time-varying characteristics of a speech signal, and the properties of the <b>ear,</b> <b>variable</b> rate coding can lead to performance gains in applications that do not require a fixed bit rate. To determine the possible gains of variable rate coding, different classes of speech signals are studied, both from an information theoretic and a perceptual perspective. A quality criterion for variable rate quantization is proposed, and it is shown that the criterion leads to the lowest possible average distortion under fairly general conditions. We also propose a coder design technique, where the quality criterion is employed to assemble a set of coder modes for a multi-mode variable rate speech coder. Memory quantization is a category of quantization where past quantization instants are exploited to reduce the distortion. Parameters in speech coding are typically correlated from one quantization instant to the next. This correlation makes memory quantization advantageous. An extension of memory VQ systems with a fixed memoryless VQ, denoted safety-net VQ, is proposed. This safety-net VQ is shown to improve the performance for quantization of several parameter sets occuring in speech coding, both for transmission over noisy and over noiseless channels. Furthermore, we propose a memory VQ scheme based on variable-length coding of quantizer indices, where the bit allocation of a dual-stage quantizer is dynamically adapted. Lattice quantization is a technique where the regular structure of a lattice is incorporated in a vector quantizer. The regularity can be exploited to reduce storage and processor capacity requirements. We propose a training algorithm for design of lattices for vector quantization, which optimizes the quantization performance of the lattice, as given by the normalized second moment, G. Several new structures, which improve on previously known values of G, are found. Theory for high-rate lattice quantization of Gaussian variables is also presented, leading to design rules and to new insights in the performance of lattice quantization. Furthermore, lattice quantization is generalized, by allowing modifications on a global scale of the quantizer, while still keeping a locally lattice-similar structure. It is shown that generalized lattice quantization of Gaussian variables can achieve comparable performance to pdf-optimized quantization, and still keep some of the advantages of conventional lattice quantization...|$|R
