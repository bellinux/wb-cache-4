40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{theoretical and}} experimental {{work on a}} <b>velocity</b> feedback <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> with an electrodynamic proof-mass actuator. The study shows that the stability and performance of the feedback control loop can be substantially improved by implementing an appropriate compensation filter, which detunes the passive and active responses of the actuator. The <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> is analysed {{in terms of the}} open- and closed-loop base impedance it presents to the structure under control. In this way the analytical expression for the proposed compensator is derived directly from known actuator parameters. The compensation filter provides significant improvement over the uncompensated case, even for considerable variations in the actuator response. One drawback of the compensator is the enhancement of the feedback signal at low frequencies, which may lead to stroke/force saturation effects in the actuator. In this respect the study shows that it can be beneficial to implement an additional high pass filter, which however produces a loss in the phase and gain margin...|$|R

Both theoretical predictions and experimental results are presented for a reference problem of control of sound radiation by a rectangular panel clamped along the perimeter.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{research work}} on self-tuning <b>velocity</b> feedback <b>control</b> <b>units</b> with voltage driven electrodynamic inertial mass actuators (IMAs). Due to the IMAs dynamics such feedback loops are only conditionally stable. Feedback compensators {{can improve the}} feedback loop stability. In the literature often ideal current driven IMAs are assumed, while most practical power amplifiers are actually voltage sources. In this paper a feedback compensator for voltage driven IMAs is derived and experimentally validated. The primary structure considered is a base excited single degree of freedom system with variable stiffness. For each stiffness setting there is a specific feedback gain setting that provides optimal control performance. Therefore a self-tuning algorithm is developed that tunes the feedback gain to minimize the kinetic energy of the primary structure, while also considering the stroke and current limits of the IMA. The self-tuning algorithm is experimentally validated for different natural frequency settings...|$|R

In particular the inertia and stiffness effects produced by the actuator on the frequency response function have been analysed. Simulation results have highlighted that the inertia effect produces amplitude reduction and phase lag at higher frequencies. The stiffness effect reduces the amplitude at low frequencies, decreases the phase lag at higher frequencies and produces an amplitude modulation effect at higher frequencies. Comparison with a measured frequency response function indicates that the proposed model has captured the principal characteristics of the sensor–actuator open-loop frequency response function up to 80 kHz...|$|R

40|$|This Technical Report {{discusses}} {{the design and}} the construction of a smart panel with five decentralised direct <b>velocity</b> feedback <b>control</b> <b>units</b> {{in order to reduce the}} vibration of the panel dominated by well separated low frequency resonances. Each <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> consists of an accelerometer sensor and a piezoelectric patch strain actuator. The integrated accelerometer signal is fed back to the actuator via a fixed negative control gain. In this way the actuator generates a control excitation proportional and opposite to the measured transverse velocity of the panel so that it produces active damping on the panel. First the open loop frequency response function between the sensor and the actuator of a single channel has been studied and an analogue controller has been designed and tested in order to improve the stability of this control system. Following the stability of all five <b>control</b> <b>units</b> has been assessed using the generalised Nyquist criterion. Finally the performances of the smart panel have been tested with reference to the reduction of the vibrations at the error positions and with reference to the reduction of the radiated sound.

The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> produce active damping provided the fundamental resonance frequency of the actuator is well below that of the structure under control. Control stability limits arise from the actuator fundamental resonance which introduces a 180 ° phase lag in the <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> response, thus causing the feedback loop to be only conditionally stable. In contrast to previous studies, this paper discusses the response of the <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> in terms of the open and closed-circuit base impedance that it exerts on the structure. This allows for a straight forward physical interpretation of both stability and control performance. Experimental and simulation results show that the base impedance can be described as the sum of passive and active frequency response functions, where the active part of the <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> response depends on the actuator dynamics and also on the response of the analogue controller circuit. It is demonstrated that the control stability could be enhanced by implementing an appropriate compensator that shifts the fundamental resonance of the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> towards lower frequencies...|$|R

Traditional load control valves {{do not have}} the load <b>velocity</b> <b>control</b> ability and its opening feature is very poor because the high spring stiffness comes along with the pressure–spring balance–based principle. Some improvement has been done by employing a two-stage pressure–pressure balance principle to make a load control valve to achieve load <b>velocity</b> <b>control</b> ability while the opening feature was not improved much. In this design, another pressure–pressure balance principle is proposed to make the load control valve achieve load <b>velocity</b> <b>control</b> ability and fast opening closing feature at the same time.

The transfer carrier is applied to the matrix, with the surface fitted with <b>control</b> <b>units</b> towards the transducers, and the transfer carrier is peeled off. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - To produce an adaptronic micro system, the transfer carrier is a film, sheet or plate, with an adhesive bond to hold the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> at a surface, with a weaker bonding than the bond between the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> and the matrix. The bonds are modified to hold the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> more strongly at the matrix. When the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are in place at the matrix, the matrix and/or the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are given an intermediate hardening. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are applied to the transfer carrier by a printing process, ink jet printing or by dispensing. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are electrodes, in an inter-digital array, or of an electrically conductive adhesive applied to the transfer carrier and treated with radiation or heat to give a total or partial hardening action. The transfer carrier, with the control electrodes, is pressed mechanically against the matrix, which is then wholly or partially hardened by radiation or heat. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> can be of conductive film or foil materials, conductive lines or network or grid, or of an intrinsic or extrinsic electrically conductive material.

This research {{is motivated by}} the increasing interest in lightweight design for fuel efficient transportation vehicles. Lightweight sandwich panels are very appealing due to their high stiffness to weight ratio but also exhibit undesirable sound transmission properties which could cause problems with vehicle interior noise. The aim of this work is to assess the performance of decentralised <b>velocity</b> feedback <b>control</b> on lightweight sandwich panels. The {{first part of this}} thesis presents the theoretical model used to predict the structural response, sound radiation and sound transmission through active panels with decentralised velocity feedback loops. The model is then used in simulation studies on the intrinsic limitation of decentralised feedback control for thin homogeneous and sandwich active panels under distributed deterministic and stochastic excitations in the whole audio frequency range. The results suggest that decentralised <b>velocity</b> feedback <b>control</b> on lightweight sandwich panels is more efficient and can be applied over wider range of audio frequencies than for conventional thin homogeneous panels. The second part of this thesis presents experimental and simulation studies on a control system with five decentralised <b>control</b> <b>units</b> with proof-mass electrodynamic actuators, installed on conventional aluminium panel and a honeycomb sandwich panel. This study provides insight in the open and closed-loop response of the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> and gives a good understanding of the interaction between the panels and the control system.
