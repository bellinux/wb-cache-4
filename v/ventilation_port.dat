5000|$|The Ampeg Bassamp Company, {{founded in}} 1949 by Everett Hull, {{responded to the}} growing demand for {{electric}} bass equipment by producing a line of bass amplifiers. Ampeg bass amps were widely used by electric bass guitarists in the 1950s and 1960s. The first bass amplifier offered by Ampeg was an 18-watt model with a single 12" [...] speaker and a rear <b>ventilation</b> <b>port</b> called the Super 800. In 1951, they introduced a 20-watt version with a 15-inch speaker. In 1960, they introduced the B-15 Portaflex, a flip-top 25-watt tube bass amplifier with a single 15" [...] speaker. While the Ampeg Portaflex had a pleasing bass tone, and was used by studio bassists such as James Jamerson and Carol Kaye, it was not powerful enough {{to be used in}} a stadium or arena concert.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to unveil the effect of different ventilation arrangements in a rectangular enclosure subjected to combined free and forced convection. A heat source is flush mounted at the bottom of the enclosure. The equations of mass, momentum and energy conservation are solved using a control-volume-based technique utilized by Ansys Fluent. A pressure based solver and second order upwind scheme is used for the solution purpose. The non-dimensional variables Richardson number (Ri) and Reynolds number (Re) were varied in the course of parametric study. It is observed that increasing the number of <b>ventilation</b> <b>ports</b> complicates the flow structure inside the enclosure and hence a justified provision of exit openings should be provided.

40|$|There {{are three}} tanks in the 241 -SY tank farm. Tank 241 -SY 101 and 241 -SY- 103 are {{flammable}} gas watch list tanks. Tank 241 -SY- 102 {{is included in}} the ventilation improvement process in an effort to further control air flow in the tank farm. This tank farm has only one outlet <b>ventilation</b> <b>port</b> for all three tanks. Flammable gas is released (may be steady and/or periodic) from the waste in the primary tank vapor space. The gas is removed from the tank by an active ventilation system. However, maintaining consistent measurable flow through the tank can be problematic due to the poor control capabilities of existing equipment. Low flow through the tank could allow flammable gas to build up in the tank and possibly exceed the lower flammability limit (LFL), prevent the most rapid removal of flammable gas from the tank after a sudden gas release, and/or cause high vacuum alarms to sound. Using the inlet and outlet down stream butterfly valves performs the current method of controlling flow in tank farm 241 -SY. A filter station is installed on the inlet of each tank, but controlling air flow with its 12 inch butterfly valve is difficult. There is also in-leakage through pump and valve pits. Butterfly valves on the downstream side of each tank could also be used to control air flow. However, their large size and the relatively low air velocity make this control method also ineffective. The proposed method of optimizing tank air flow and pressure control capability is to install an air flow controller on the inlet of each existing filter station in SY farm, and seal as best as practical all other air leakage paths. Such air flow controllers have been installed on 241 -AN and 241 -AW tanks (see drawing H- 2 - 85647) ...|$|E

500|$|Arguments arose, {{frequently}} {{over the}} issue of speed; the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet (CINCUS) refused to allow the new ship to drop below , the Battle Force argued at least [...] was necessary to maintain homogeneity in the line of battle, {{and the president of the}} War College maintained a fast ship was optimal, but the navy would continue to operate the older [...] battleships until the 1950s and so a higher speed was not strictly necessarythough it would mean the class would be too slow to act as escorts for fast carrier task forces. The primary 666-ft design was the only plan that could meet the specified requirements for speed, protection, and the nine 16-inch guns. By late 1937 a proposed design was agreed on, requiring only small modifications to save weight and increase the fields of fire.

40|$|A {{computational}} work {{is performed}} {{to investigate the}} transient heat and mass transfer inside a ventilated enclosure.

In case 1, the outlet port {{is located on the}} top of the left vertical wall, in case 2 at the right and case 3 at the middle of the ceiling. Finite element method is employed to solve the governing equations of flow, heat and mass transfer. Also, the heatline and massline techniques are used to visualize the heat and mass transfer patterns. Obtained results show the evolution of various contours of stream function, isotherms and iso-concentrations as well as various parameters such as Nu and Sc numbers. It is found in particular that in order to reach highest heat and mass transfer rates for Gr = 10 (7), the outlet port should be located near the top of the left vertical wall.

50|$|Throughout {{the height}} of the Atlantic slave trade (1570-1808), slave ships were {{normally}} smaller than traditional cargo ships, with most slave ships weighing between 150 and 250 tons. This equated to about 350 to 450 enslaved Africans on each slave ship, or 1.5 to 2.4 per ton. The English ships of the time normally fell on the larger side of this spectrum and the French on the smaller side. Ships purposely designed to be smaller and more maneuverable were meant to navigate the African coastal rivers into farther inland ports; these ships therefore increased the effects of the slave trade on Africa. Additionally, the ships' sizes increased slightly throughout the 1700s; however the number of enslaved Africans per ship remained the same. This reduction in the ratio of enslaved Africans to ship tonnage was designed {{to increase the amount of}} space per person and thus improve the survival chances of everyone on board. These ships also had temporary storage decks which were separated by an open latticework or grate bulkhead, Ship masters would presumably use these chambers to divide enslaved Africans and help prevent mutiny. Some ships developed by the turn of the 19th century even had <b>ventilation</b> <b>ports</b> built into the sides and between gun ports (with hatches to keep inclement weather out). These open deck designs increased airflow and thus helped improve survival rates, diminishing potential investment losses.|$|R

The baseline results showed a marked reduction in the amplitude of the dynamic pressure waveforms over previously published studies due to the use of air instead of refrigerant as the working fluid.

40|$|Despite strong {{evidence}} of protective benefits, thermal discomfort {{is a key}} disincentive to motorcyclists wearing protective clothing in hot conditions. This paper presents some findings from our studies concerning the thermal management properties of motorcycle protective clothing and their physiological impact in hot conditions. The thermal and vapour permeability and abrasion resistance properties of motorcycle protective clothing were investigated in laboratory tests. The physiological and cognitive impact on humans was investigated using objective and subjective measures under controlled climate conditions and in a real-world riding trial. The aims were to determine: (i) if associations existed between thermal management and the abrasion-resistance properties {{of a range of}} commonly available, all-season motorcycle protective suits, (ii) the extent of the thermal load imposed by motorcycle clothing worn in average Australian summer conditions, and (iii) the impact of that thermal burden on psychophysical function. The results demonstrated significant physiological strain for motorcyclists wearing protective clothing in hot conditions. Wide variations in the thermal characteristics and abrasion resistance properties of the suits tested were identified. Ongoing work is investigating the impact that elevated thermal discomfort and physiological thermal strain can have on riding performance and the potential for clothing features, such as <b>ventilation</b> <b>ports</b> to reduce thermal discomfort. These results will determine thresholds for the thermal qualities of motorcycle clothing required for an acceptable compromise between user comfort and injury protection.

40|$|Introduction: Personal {{protective}} clothing and equipment, when used during moderate to heavy workloads, can push individuals {{to the limits}} of physiological regulation. What is less certain is the physiological strain imposed by appropriately protective ensembles when riding a motorcycle, and whether or not one need even consider the impact of that strain. Nevertheless, evidence indicates that thermal discomfort is a key disincentive to the wearing of motorcycle {{protective clothing}} in hot weather. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to quantify thermal and cardiovascular strain during a simulated urban, motorcycle ride, conducted under laboratory conditions. Methods: Twelve males were investigated on four occasions across three thermal environments: 25 oC (water vapour pressure 1. 3 kPa), 30 oC (1. 7 kPa) and 35 oC (2. 25 kPa). Each trial was comprised of three, 30 -min stages: 25 min cycling (30 W) plus 5 min rest. Heart rates, and auditory-canal and mean skin temperatures were measured. Clothing was modified between full accident protection (helmet, jacket, trousers, gloves, boots; <b>ventilation</b> <b>ports</b> closed) and an unprotected state (helmet, gloves, boots, jeans, long-sleeve t-shirt), with both conditions tested at 25 oC, and the full protective ensemble also investigated at 30 o and 35 oC. Results: Increasing rider protection at 25 oC did not modify auditory-canal temperature (P> 0. 05), but mean skin temperatures (2 oC) and steady-state heart rates were displaced vertically (12 beats. min- 1; both P 38. 5 oC) and profound hyperthermia (> 40. 0 oC) were predicted to occur within 105 min (SD 20. 6) and 180 min (SD 33. 0). The latter might eventuate in ~ 10 h at 30 oC, but would not occur at 25 oC. Thermal discomfort increased sequentially in the 35 oC trial, averaging between “uncomfortable” and “very uncomfortable”. Discussion: The principal outcomes from this experiment were that, within air temperatures that approximated deep-body temperature, as may be encountered during an Australian summer, urban motorcyclists would be likely to approach profound hyperthermia and potentially debilitating central cardiovascular strain within 3 h, and earlier in sedentary and overweight riders. However, at air temperatures of 25 o and 30 oC, neither of those outcomes would be likely. What remains uncertain {{is whether or not the}} level of physiological strain encountered at 35 oC would have an adverse impact upon cognitive function, perhaps through reducing cerebral blood flow, which may, in turn, elevate the risk of motorcycle accidents. This possibility forms the basis of ongoing research. Conclusion: This experiment was designed to evaluate the physiological significance of motorcycle impact-protective ensembles under close to worst-case conditions. The outcomes indicate that greater design attention is required to enhance dry and evaporative heat dissipation from clothing intended for summer use in hotter climates, but without compromising injury protection...|$|R
30|$|After {{instrumentation}} and stabilization, a {{trial of}} EVA using a 4.4  mm outer diameter, cuffed intratracheal catheter (Tritube) was performed to assure proper function {{of the system and}} determine hemodynamic effects in normovolemia in six of the subjects. The Tritube has three lumens: a 2.3  mm internal diameter lumen for <b>ventilation,</b> a distal <b>port</b> for monitoring intratracheal pressure, and a lumen for inflation/deflation of the cuff (Fig.  1). The Tritube was inserted through the endotracheal tube and the distal tip positioned above the tracheal origin of the right upper (cranial) lobe bronchus with bronchoscopic guidance. The Tritube was marked to assure equal depth of placement each time, and the inflated cuff created a closed system. Ventilation was initiated with an automated Ventrain device. During inspiration, the device delivers a constant rate of gas flow until the pressure measured {{at the end of the}} Tritube reaches a limit set by the user. The user also sets the ratio of inspiratory to expiratory times and the desired level of end-expiratory pressure. The EVA ventilator assists expiratory flow by producing a linear decline in intratracheal pressure until reaching the target end-expiratory pressure (Fig. 1). To confirm that the desired levels of negative end-expiratory pressure could be achieved, the target was progressively reduced from +[*] 4 to −[*] 8  cmH 2 O with minute ventilation kept constant. Each step lasted for ~[*] 8  min with FiO 2 of 1.0, and arterial blood gases measured.
