25|$|A {{relatively}} small energy, often {{as little as}} 0.2–2 millijoules, is needed to ignite a flammable mixture of a fuel and air. For the common industrial hydrocarbon gases and solvents, the minimum ignition energy required for ignition of vapor-air mixture is lowest for the <b>vapor</b> <b>concentration</b> roughly in the middle between the lower explosive limit and the upper explosive limit, and rapidly increases as the concentration deviates from this optimum to either side. Aerosols of flammable liquids may be ignited well below their flash point. Generally, liquid aerosols with particle sizes below 10 micrometers behave like vapors, particle sizes above 40 micrometers behave more like flammable dusts. Typical minimum flammable concentrations of aerosols lay between 15 and 50 g/m3. Similarly, presence of foam {{on the surface of}} a flammable liquid significantly increases ignitability. Aerosol of flammable dust can be ignited as well, resulting in a dust explosion; the lower explosive limit usually lies between 50 and 1000 g/m3; finer dusts tend to be more explosive and requiring less spark energy to set off. Simultaneous presence of flammable vapors and flammable dust can significantly decrease the ignition energy; a mere 1 vol.% of propane in air can reduce the required ignition energy of dust by 100 times. Higher than normal oxygen content in atmosphere also significantly lowers the ignition energy.|$|E

A driver who does not discharge static by contacting a conductive part of the car will carry it to the insulated handle of the nozzle and the static potential will eventually be discharged when this purposely-grounded arrangement is put {{into contact with the}} metallic filler neck of the vehicle. Ordinarily, vapor concentrations in the area of this filling operation are below the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the product being dispensed, so the static discharge causes no problem. The problem with ungrounded gas cans results from a combination of vehicular static charge, the potential between the container and the vehicle, and the loose fit between the grounded nozzle and the gas can. This last condition causes a rich <b>vapor</b> <b>concentration</b> in the ullage (the unfilled volume) of the gas can, and a discharge from the can to the grounded hanging hardware (the nozzle, hose, swivels and break-a-ways) can thus occur at a most inopportune point.

Stars with an age of 4.6 billion years, middle star life, are at the most stable state. Proper metallicity and size are also very important to stability. The Sun has a low 0.1% solar luminosity variation. A solar twin star, would be a star with low luminosity variation. To date no solar twin with an exact match as that of the Sun has been found, however, there are some stars that come close to being identical. The star must have no stellar companions, other close by stars as in binary systems, would disrupt the orbits of planets. Estimates suggest that 50% or more of all star systems are binary systems. The habitable zone for a main sequence star very gradually moves out over time until the star becomes a white dwarf, at which time the habitable zone vanishes. The habitable zone is closely connected to the greenhouse warming afforded by atmospheric water vapor (...) , carbon dioxide (...) , and/or other greenhouse gases.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a condensational growth technique for particle abatement, activated via heterogeneous nucleation, was evaluated both theoretically and experimentally. Based upon information present in the literature, the heterogeneous nucleation rate and particle activation probability were estimated {{as a function of}} the environmental conditions. This work demonstrated that it is possible to capture the dispersed particles in the water droplets with high efficiency, depending on operating conditions. Increased final particle size, which improves removal from the gas stream, was found with relatively high inlet <b>vapor</b> <b>concentrations</b> and low working temperatures. It is also worth noting that extreme working conditions might be useful for the particle coverage. In fact, both nucleation and growth processes are active at very low <b>vapor</b> <b>concentrations,</b> although the maximum growth factor at these conditions is relatively low. Although it is not valid in predicting the induction time, a theoretical evaluation of the activation probability provides an indication of the process effectiveness at high <b>vapor</b> <b>concentrations</b> and low inlet temperatures.

40|$|A warm bias in {{tropical}} tropopause temperature {{is found in}} the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM), in common with most models from phase 5 of CMIP (CMIP 5). Key dynamical, microphysical, and radiative processes influencing the tropical tropopause temperature and lower-stratospheric water <b>vapor</b> <b>concentrations</b> in climate models are investigated using the MetUM. A series of sensitivity experiments are run to separate the effects of vertical advection, ice optical and microphysical properties, convection, cirrus clouds, and atmospheric composition on simulated tropopause temperature and lower-stratospheric water <b>vapor</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the tropics. The numerical accuracy of the vertical advection, determined in the MetUM by the choice of interpolation and conservation schemes used, is found to be particularly important. Microphysical and radiative processes are found to influence stratospheric water vapor both through modifying the tropical tropopause temperature and through modifying upper-tropospheric water <b>vapor</b> <b>concentrations,</b> allowing more water vapor to be advected into the stratosphere.

50|$|Lower {{flammability}} limit (LFL), usually expressed in volume per cent, is {{the lower end}} of the concentration range over which a flammable mixture of gas or vapour in air can be ignited at a given temperature and pressure. The flammability range is delineated by the upper and lower {{flammability limit}}s. Outside this range of air/vapor mixtures, the mixture can not be ignited (unless the temperature and pressure are increased). The LFL decreases with increasing temperature; thus, a mixture that is below its LFL at a given temperature may be ignitable if heated sufficiently. For liquids, the LFL is typically close to the saturated <b>vapor</b> <b>concentration</b> at the flash point, however, due to differences in the liquid properties, the relationship of LFL to flash point (which is also dependent on the test apparatus) is not fixed and some spread in the data usually exists.|$|E

50|$|A major {{limitation}} of electrokinetics {{is the introduction}} of an external fluid into the soil. If the contaminant cannot be dissolved {{it is not possible}} to extract the contaminant of interest. Electrolysis near the electrodes can alter the pH of the soil especially if the current is induced for an extended period of time. Extended use of electrokinetics system can also cause acidic conditions around the electrodes sometimes reacting with contaminants. If increased acidification of the soil is not environmentally acceptable the use of electrokinetics should be reevaluated. Large metal objects that are buried underground also pose as a limitation to electrodes because they offer a path to short circuit the system. Buried metal objects can also change the voltage gradient and decrease or stop the flow. The removal of volatile organic compounds from the soils can increase the soil <b>vapor</b> <b>concentration.</b> Counterintuitively, highly permeable soils lower the efficiency of electrokinetics. Where a low permeable soil like clay can receive up to 90% initial contaminant removal a low permeable soil like peat achieves about 65% removal of initial contaminants.|$|E
