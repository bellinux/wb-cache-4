5|$|Keith {{questions}} Veronica {{about whether}} or not she broke into the house, despite knowing her guilt. Jake and a county prosecutor tell Keith that they will get a judge's order and will return to prosecute Veronica. The supercomputer processes the names of all the Castle members just as Keith hands over the surveillance tape to the county prosecutor. Logan tries to apologize to Veronica. One of the Castle members comes up and tells her that the organization videotaped her, and Logan assaults him. Veronica returns the tape to Jake Kane on the condition that he does not tell Keith about it. She sees in the newspaper that charges have been filed against Keith for tampering with evidence relating to Veronica's break-in, likely meaning that he will lose the votes needed to win the sheriff's election. She goes into a <b>voting</b> <b>booth</b> and votes for Keith as sheriff, walking away in pouring rain.|$|E
25|$|The {{chairmanship}} election {{coincided with}} elections for 985 party delegates for the KMT's 17th national party congress.

25|$|The years 1880 and 1881 saw a new {{influx of}} {{political}} refugees from Germany, {{activists in the}} socialist movement fleeing the crackdown on radicalism launched with the Anti-Socialist Laws of 1878. This influx of new German members, coming {{during a time of}} low ebb of the English-speaking membership, extended Germanic influence in the SLP. Excluded from the <b>voting</b> <b>booth</b> by their lack of citizenship status, many of the newcomers had little use for electoral politics. An SLP German militia sued on Second Amendment grounds {{to keep and bear arms}} in Chicago parades. The Supreme Court ruled against them in Presser v. Illinois, however.|$|E
25|$|SNL {{has also}} {{had an effect on}} American {{elections}} – most commonly presidential elections. Voters have reported that political sketches that were shown on the program influenced them in the <b>voting</b> <b>booth.</b> The so-called SNL Effect was observed during the 2008 presidential campaign, according to Mike Dabadie. Two-thirds of voters who responded to a poll said they had seen a broadcast of politically charged content on SNL, with ten percent saying that it had made a difference in their decision. Barack Obama was the beneficiary of the political content, with 59 percent saying they did in fact cast a vote for the Democratic then-nominee.|$|E

500|$|Thomas {{called the}} scene in which Keith makes Veronica dinner [...] "quintessential Keith" [...] and {{indicative}} of his lasting commitment to his daughter. Despite knowing that the episode could be the series finale, Thomas did not want it to completely resolve all plot lines; his intention was to keep viewers guessing and prevent the conclusion from being too bland or typical. He ultimately felt that the final shot of Veronica {{walking away from the}} <b>voting</b> <b>booth</b> in the rain was [...] "a pretty melancholy way to go out". The song [...] "It Never Rains in Southern California" [...] by Albert Hammond plays during the final scene. In promotional advertising for the episode, The CW billed it as a season finale, {{despite the fact that the}} series had already been cancelled.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} mental <b>voting</b> <b>booths,</b> i. e. a building block for voting schemes that provides remote voters with similar protection as that offered by physical <b>voting</b> <b>booths,</b> essentially protecting them from over-the-shoulder coercion attacks (shoulder-surfing). We introduce a framework to model <b>voting</b> <b>booths</b> and formulate a property of the modelled booths that is sufficient to ensure over-the-shoulder coercion resistance. Next, we propose an example of mental booth that is simple enough {{to be used by}} any voter without prior training and show that an execution of the remote booth {{in the presence of the}} adversary is equivalent to that execution in his absence (e. g. inside a physical booth). The only cost lies in the use of an untappable channel in order to transmit a piece of information before the <b>voting</b> phase. Mental <b>booths</b> also allow for the voter to safely delegate his own voice to an untrusted person while still being able to verify that the untrusted person followed his instructions while voting. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

The levies to build the new library and remodel the Shute Park location failed. The first measure in 2002 received majority support at the <b>voting</b> <b>booth,</b> but lost due to low voter turnout and the state’s double-majority law.|$|E
2500|$|Wade {{was killed}} in a car {{accident}} when strong winds swept his Jeep off a North Carolina highway in 1996. Three weeks before his death, Wade was honored by First Lady Hillary Clinton at The White House as one of the 10 finalists in an essay contest sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Voice of America for an essay he wrote on entering the <b>voting</b> <b>booth</b> with his father. [...] Wade, accompanied by his parents and sister, went on to meet North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms, who later entered Wade's essay and his obituary into the Congressional Record. Edwards and his wife began the Wade Edwards Foundation in their son's memory; the purpose of the non-profit organization is [...] "to reward, encourage, and inspire young people in the pursuit of excellence." [...] The Foundation funded the Wade Edwards Learning Lab at Wade's high school, Needham B. Broughton High School in Raleigh, along with scholarship competitions and essay awards.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, Barlow {{was unable to}} {{reconcile}} his ardent libertarianism with the prevailing neoconservative movement, and [...] "didn't feel tempted to vote for Bush"; in 2004, {{he said that he}} was [...] "voting for John Kerry, though with little enthusiasm". Barlow has subsequently declared that he is a Republican, most notably during an appearance on The Colbert Report on March 26, 2007, and has also claimed on many occasions to be an anarchist. Barlow has said he voted for Natural Law Party Presidential candidate John Hagelin in 2000 after discovering in the <b>voting</b> <b>booth</b> that his friend Nat Goldhaber was Hagelin's running mate. He said in 2004: [...] "I'm embarrassed for my country that in my entire voting life, there has never been a major-party candidate whom I felt I could vote for. All of my presidential votes, whether for George Wallace, Dick Gregory, or John Hagelin, have been protest votes." [...] Barlow condemned Donald Trump in November 2016, characterizing him as a [...] "thorough creep" [...] and [...] "toxic asshole" [...] in a Facebook [...] "micromanifesto".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{condemnation}} from media outlets— in 1965, when reporter Theodore H. White published The Making of the President, 1964, {{he referred}} to Wallace as a [...] "narrow-minded, grotesquely provincial man"— Wallace's opposition to the Civil Rights Act, which he based upon states' rights, represented what pundits and analysts began referring to as backlash, specifically white backlash. Coined in summer 1963 {{to refer to the}} possibility that white workers, when forced to compete with their black colleagues in a shrinking job market, might [...] "lash back", backlash came to be associated with whites' ability {{to do so in the}} <b>voting</b> <b>booth</b> in the face of racial tension, as they had done with the repeal of the Rumford Fair Housing Act in California. A series of riots over civil rights in cities throughout the U.S., notably in Cambridge, Maryland, and the Black Power movement further heightened the tension on which Wallace was able to capitalize. Wallace's connection with the alienated workingman would later manifest itself in the concept of the so-called [...] "silent majority".|$|E
2500|$|Compulsory voting {{has also}} been {{promoted}} for its collective benefits. [...] It becomes difficult for coercion {{to be used to}} prevent disadvantaged people (the old, illiterate or disabled) to vote, and for obstacles to be put in the way of classes of individuals (ethnic/coloured; either registration requirements or placement of voting booths) as often happens under other voting systems. The compulsion requirement also needs to be kept in proportion: jury duty and compulsory military service are vastly more onerous citizen's compulsions [...] than attending a local <b>voting</b> <b>booth</b> once every few years. Perhaps the most compelling reason to use a system of compulsory voting is a simple matter of logistics, that is, to facilitate the smooth and orderly process of an election. Every year in countries that do not have compulsory voting election officials have to guess at the numbers of voters who might turn out – this often depends on the vagaries of the weather. Often voters are disenfranchied in those countries when voting officials err and not enough voting booths are provided. Long queues can result with voters being turned away at the close of polling not having had their chance to exercise their democratic right to vote.|$|E
2500|$|On October 20, {{during early}} voting, a voter in Homer photographed {{a list of}} {{write-in}} candidates that was posted inside a <b>voting</b> <b>booth,</b> which {{raised the issue of}} whether the state should be posting, or even providing such a list. A lawsuit was filed alleging that the Alaska Division of Elections was violating AAC, 25.070, which reads in part: [...] "Information regarding a write-in candidate may not be discussed, exhibited or provided at the polling place, or within 200 feet of any entrance to the polling place, on election day." [...] Both Republican and Democratic spokespersons decried the lists as electioneering on behalf of Murkowski; representatives of the Division of Elections maintained that the lists were intended merely to assist voters. On October 27 a judge issued a restraining order barring the lists, noting in his decision [...] "If it were important 'assistance' for the Division to provide voters with lists of write-in candidates, then the Division has been asleep at the switch for the past 50 years, the Division first developed the need for a write-in candidate list 12 days ago." [...] Later on the same day, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that the lists could be distributed to those who asked for them, but that any ballots cast by voters based on information on the lists be [...] "segregated". The Division of Elections responded that they had neither the manpower nor the time to implement such a system by Election Day. By the deadline for registering as a write-in candidate, more than 150 Alaskans had submitted their names as candidates for the U.S. Senate seat, encouraged by an Anchorage talk radio host.|$|E

6000|$|The Marquesans of {{the present}} {{generation}} lack the energy to hoist and place such huge stones. Also, they lack incentive. There are plenty of pae-paes to go around, with a few thousand unoccupied ones left over. Once or twice, as we ascended the valley, we saw magnificent pae-paes bearing on their general surface pitiful little straw huts, the proportions being similar to a <b>voting</b> <b>booth</b> perched on the broad foundation of the Pyramid of Cheops. For the Marquesans are perishing, and, to judge from conditions at Taiohae, {{the one thing that}} retards their destruction is the infusion of fresh blood. A pure Marquesan is a rarity. They seem to be all half-breeds and strange conglomerations of dozens of different races. Nineteen able labourers are all the trader at Taiohae can muster for the loading of copra on shipboard, and in their veins runs the blood of English, American, Dane, German, French, Corsican, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Hawaiian, Paumotan, Tahitian, and Easter Islander. There are more races than there are persons, but it is a wreckage of races at best. Life faints and stumbles and gasps itself away. In this warm, equable clime--a truly terrestrial paradise--where are never extremes of temperature and where the air is like balm, kept ever pure by the ozone-laden southeast trade, asthma, phthisis, and tuberculosis flourish as luxuriantly as the vegetation. Everywhere, from the few grass huts, arises the racking cough or exhausted groan of wasted lungs. Other horrible diseases prosper as well, but the most deadly of all are those that attack the lungs. There is a form of consumption called [...] "galloping," [...] which is especially dreaded. In two months' time it reduces the strongest man to a skeleton under a grave-cloth. In valley after valley the last inhabitant has passed and the fertile soil has relapsed to jungle. In Melville's day the valley of Hapaa (spelled by him [...] "Happar") was peopled by a strong and warlike tribe. A generation later, it contained but two hundred persons. To-day it is an untenanted, howling, tropical wilderness.|$|E
