40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{an effect of}} basic soil tillage on {{physical}} and hydrophysical properties of cambisol. The chosen site {{is located in the}} village of Uhřínov, in potato production area. At an altitude of 506 m it is a <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> plowing. At an altitude of 520 m it is a <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> minimization. Two lands were chosen to present minimization process at one of them and classical plowing process at the second of them. Soil pits were dug in both versions and a description of soil profiles according to the Comprehensive Survey Methodology of Agricultural Soils (NĚMEČEK 1967) was carried. Intact soil samples were taken in ten terms, four replications, from the depths (center roller) : 5 cm, 17 cm and 30 cm. Bulk samples were taken also from these depths (range 10 cm). The average volume of macroaggregates (> 0. 5 mm) was reduced during the experiment from 39, 67 % in 2012 to 33, 52 % in 2014 in a <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> plowing. The average volume in a <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> minimization changed only minimally. The volume of microaggregates in a <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> plowing incereased during the years. This volume was amounted to 3, 71 % in 2002, while in 2014 the figure was 4, 21 %. The volume of microaggregates decreased in a <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> minimization from 4, 18 % in 2012 to mere 2, 51 % in 2014. The influence of basic tillage to bulk density was not statistically proven however there was extreme compaction found at the depths of 30 cm in both versions. Statistically highly significant effect of basic agrotechnics on total porosity was found. It was the value of 45, 27 % in a <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> plowing and the value of 34, 06 % in a <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> minimization. Highly significant effect of basic agrotechnics on maximal capillary water capacity was found. The value of maximal capillary capacity was 37, 40 % of a volume in a <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> plowing. The value of it was 35, 27 % of a volume in a <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> minimization. The effect of basic agrotechnics on soil moisture was highly important. Humidity was 23, 73 % of a volume in a <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> tillage. It was 17, 92 % of a volume in a <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> minimization. The effect of basic agrotechnics on soil airiness was statistically significant. Airiness was of the value 21, 56 % of a volume in a <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> tillage. Airiness was 25, 23 % of a volume in a <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> minimization. Highly significant effect of the basic soil tillage on minimum air capacity was found. Maximal water-holding capacity was 7, 29 % of a volume in a <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> plowing. It was 8, 27 % of a volume in a <b>variant</b> <b>of</b> minimization...|$|R
