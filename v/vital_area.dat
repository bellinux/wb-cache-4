5|$|Manitoba is {{bordered by}} the {{province}}s of Ontario {{to the east and}} Saskatchewan to the west, the territories of Nunavut to the north, and Northwest Territories to the northwest, and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south. It adjoins Hudson Bay to the northeast, and is the only prairie province to have a saltwater coastline. The Port of Churchill is Canada's only Arctic deep-water port and the shortest shipping route between North America and Asia. Lake Winnipeg is the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world. Hudson Bay is the world's second-largest bay. Manitoba {{is at the heart of}} the giant Hudson Bay watershed, once known as Rupert's Land. It was a <b>vital</b> <b>area</b> of the Hudson's Bay Company, with many rivers and lakes that provided excellent opportunities for the lucrative fur trade.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the <b>vital</b> <b>area</b> of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E

25|$|Stingrays are not {{aggressive}} and only attack humans when provoked, such as if a ray is accidentally stepped on. To avoid stepping on a stingray in shallow water, the water should be waded {{through with a}} shuffle. Alternatively, before wading, small stones can be thrown into the water to scare stingrays away. Contact with the stinger causes local trauma (from the cut itself), pain, swelling, muscle cramps from the venom, and later may result in infection from bacteria or fungi. The injury is very painful, but seldom life-threatening unless the stinger pierces a <b>vital</b> <b>area.</b> The barb usually breaks off in the wound, and surgery {{may be required to}} remove the fragments.|$|E
25|$|A {{more recent}} work on Bartle Frere's life, The Zulu and the Raj; The Life of Sir Bartle Frere by D. P. O'Connor, {{examines}} details of Frere's life and motives more fully than was permissible in Victorian times when Martineau was writing. In particular, O'Connor points to Frere {{as a leading}} thinker on imperial defence. He sets the Zulu war {{in the context of}} the overall global crisis, contingent on the 1877 Balkan War, which was widely expected to result in war between Britain and Russia. Frere was sent to South Africa to turn this <b>vital</b> <b>area</b> into a secure bastion on the route to India, but was distracted from the task by the routine instability of the South African theatre.|$|E
25|$|Mining {{operations}} can {{be grouped}} into five major categories {{in terms of}} their respective resources. These are oil and gas extraction, coal mining, metal ore mining, nonmetallic mineral mining and quarrying, and mining support activities. Of all of these categories, oil and gas extraction remains {{one of the largest in}} terms of its global economic importance. Prospecting potential mining sites, a <b>vital</b> <b>area</b> of concern for the mining industry, is now done using sophisticated new technologies such as seismic prospecting and remote-sensing satellites. Mining is heavily affected by the prices of the commodity minerals, which are often volatile. The 2000s commodities boom ("commodities supercycle") increased the prices of commodities, driving aggressive mining. In addition, the price of gold increased dramatically in the 2000s, which increased gold mining; for example, one study found that conversion of forest in the Amazon increased six-fold from the period 2003–2006 (292 ha/yr) to the period 2006–2009 (1,915 ha/yr), largely due to artisanal mining.|$|E

2500|$|Ruby {{possesses}} a mysterious and presumably magical demon-killing knife, which Kripke {{refers to as}} [...] "a hand-to-hand version of the Colt". Its handle is made of elk antlers, and the knife has engravings {{on both sides of}} the blade, although the symbols are all nonsensical. It has been seen and used many times following its introduction in the third season. Upon being stabbed in a <b>vital</b> <b>area,</b> the demon is almost immediately killed, usually taking the human host with it. The only known survivor is Bobby Singer who stabbed himself with it while fighting off a possession and was left paralyzed as a result. It is unknown if it is effective against other supernatural beings, although it is useless against angels. Furthermore, the higher-ranked demons are resistant or even immune to the effects of the knife. Creator Eric Kripke doubted that how the knife functions would ever be revealed, stating, [...] "I like to leave some things mysterious. And that's likely to remain mysterious." [...] However, the eighth season reveals it to be [...] "an ancient demon-killing knife of the Kurds".|$|E
2500|$|Part of Ebrington Barracks {{was handed}} over to the Royal Navy in mid-1941 and the entire barracks came under Admiralty command in 1943 as RN Barracks Ebrington, part of the Londonderry shore base known as HMS Ferret. [...] The old North of Ireland {{shipyard}} at Pennyburn was also taken over {{to be used as a}} ship repair facility, manned by workers from the Harland and Wolff yard at Belfast. Ships based at Ferret were under the operational control of Western Approaches Command, located in Plymouth for the early part of the war. [...] The main headquarters for the Western Approaches Command was moved to Liverpool in February 1941 as the North Western Approaches became the most <b>vital</b> <b>area</b> of convoy activity. [...] Ferret was then the backup for the Liverpool headquarters, with the other main bases in the area being at Greenock, and later at Belfast. The organisational function of Ferret was to form escort groups of the warships based there, mostly small destroyers, frigates, corvettes and armed trawlers. From 1 February 1941 these craft had a separate accounting system from the main base. [...] By 1942 this system had been extended to handle the accounts of Royal Navy ships based at St' John's and Argentia. [...] A Coastal Forces base was established in April 1941, under the name HMS Ferret II.|$|E
