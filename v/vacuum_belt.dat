40|$|Crop-based {{biodiesel}} has incurred international condemnation {{during recent}} years. Microalgae are strongly advocated {{as the most}} promising substitute for oil crops. However the commercialization of microalgal biodiesel is hindered by {{the high cost of}} microalgal feedstock and production through conventional processes. This thesis investigates the downstream processing of microalgal dewatering, lipid extraction, and transesterification. For microalgal dewatering, an energy-efficient <b>vacuum</b> <b>belt</b> filtration system with adaptable productivity is designed. For conventional lipid extraction-transesterification process, Soxhlet method and Bligh & Dyer method followed by alkali catalyzed transesterification are investigated by using avocados and microalgae Chlorella, respectively. The conventional methods are proved effective for laboratory scale biodiesel production. Avocado-based biodiesel production is patented by our group. Five transesterification parameters are determined, including water content, reaction time, temperature, catalysts, and molar ratio of methanol to oil. However these laboratory protocols are difficult to be scaled up and conventional extraction-transesterification process cannot lead to cost-competitive microalgal biodiesel. This thesis therefore designs a cost-effective, scalable process by integrating oil extraction and conversion into one step through in-situ transesterification. The co-solvent is the key to success. The co-solvent criteria for microalgal biodiesel production through in-situ transesterification are proposed. The overall biodiesel yield of microalgae Spirulina is determined by using Bligh & Dyer method and alkali catalyzed transesterification. The performance of the selected co-solvents of toluene, dichloromethane and diethyl ether, as well as other solvent combinations in in-situ transesterification is evaluated by the overall biodiesel yield. Among all the co-solvents, toluene/methanol system, 2 to 1 by volume ratio, demonstrates the highest efficiency which achieves a biodiesel yield of 76 % of the overall biodiesel yield for the first in-situ transesterification cycle and 10 % for the second in-situ transesterification cycle...|$|E

40|$|Equidistant, uniform seed {{placement}} {{is important}} in lettuce production as seeds are densely planted within the row, typically only about 5 cm apart. When seeds are sown too close together, it is time consuming to thin seedlings to the desired plant spacing of 20 to 30 cm by hand and {{very difficult to do}} mechanically. The overall goal of the project was to improve lettuce seed placement accuracy and reduce the percentage of seeds spaced closely together. Specific objectives were: 1) to compare vacuum and belt-type planters to determine which style of planter provides better planting performance, 2) to evaluate belt planter seeding performance with different types of furrow openers, and 3) to develop practical modifications for vacuum planters to improve lettuce seed placement accuracy. Three vacuum planter configurations, an unmodified and two reduced seed drop height designs and a belt planter equipped with two types of furrow openers were tested in situ with pelleted lettuce seed at four travel speeds ranging from 1. 6 to 4. 0 kph. Belt planter performance was significantly better than that of the vacuum planter. <b>Vacuum</b> and <b>belt</b> planters both provided acceptable levels of performance at speeds below 2. 4 kph, but at higher speeds, seed placement accuracy declined rapidly. No differences in planter performance were found between the two belt planter configurations tested. The mid-level drop height vacuum planter configuration had significantly better seed placement precision and fewer closely spaced seed spacings as compared to the unmodified vacuum planter. These findings illustrate the significant effect planter type, travel speed, and drop height have on planter performance. They also contradict the common perception that vacuum planters deliver seed more precisely and with fewer closely-spaced seeds as compared to belt planters. Further study is needed {{to determine the extent to}} which planter performance affects hand thinning labor costs, automated machine performance, final plant stand uniformity, and crop yield...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to compare the efficiency of counter-current and co-current filter cake washing techniques. Filter cake washing is a common unit operation which {{is used in the}} chemical process industry for improving the recovery of the liquid phase or for purifying the solid phase of the filter cake. Counter-current displacement washing is more difficult to arrange and it requires additional process equipment but the advantage of counter-current method is that the consumption of wash water that is required for achieving certain filter cake purity may be considerably decreased when compared to the co-current washing method. This is true especially for materials that are difficult to wash. The literature part of this thesis consists of a review of filter cake washing in general, including the basic principles of co-current and counter-current techniques, and a description of the structure and operation of a horizontal <b>vacuum</b> <b>belt</b> filter, which is the equipment considered in the experimental part of this thesis. Also the most common cake washing models are introduced. The experiments were performed by washing wheat apatite filter cakes in a laboratory scale vacuum filter by using both co-current and counter-current washing methods. The main results of these tests were the washing curves that relate the purity of the filter cake to the amount of wash liquid used. Comparison between the obtained washing curves showed that both washing methods could be efficiently applied for achieving good washing results. The differences between the wash liquid consumptions in the co-current and counter-current washing methods were found to be surprisingly small but this is most probably explained by the relatively good washing characteristics of the apatite cakes. The washing models introduced in the literature part were compared with the results obtained from the experiments and it was found out that the studied cake washing processes could be describe...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003. Dewatering coal, and {{especially}} fine coal (- 600 μm), {{is a significant}} problem {{in the preparation of}} coal. The final moisture level of fine coal can be anything up to 30 % by weight, {{depending on the type of}} dewatering equipment used. Moisture in coal can cause many problems, for example by increasing the transportation costs, as well as decreasing the calorific value of the coal. In industry today there is a need for a dewatering technique that will produce a drier final product. It was found that an interruption in the application of vacuum during a single dewatering cycle yielded a filter cake with a lower final moisture content. It was also demonstrated that the rate at which the coal is being dewatered is much higher than during continuous vacuum application. A further study of this phenomenon showed a twofold time dependency involving both the duration of the vacuum break, and the instant it is introduced in the dewatering cycle. An optimum was found at about 29 s time duration and an introduction time of 30 s, after the start of the cycle. The possibilities of diffusion and cake structural changes were investigated. For the diffusion tests, repeated interruptions of the vacuum were performed during a single dewatering cycle. Although the kinetics agreed with what was expected, the final moisture content was not as low as that found for the optimum single break test. The compressibility of a coal filter cake was one of the structural changes investigated, the other being an increase in area and, thus, airflow through the cake. Coal filter cakes were shown to be largely incompressible. It was, however, shown that an increase in area, and thus an increase in the airflow through the cake, gave excellent results. An increased area resulted in a much lower final moisture content as well as an increase in the dewatering rate. The addition of a cake surface cutter to a standard <b>vacuum</b> <b>belt</b> filter will make the application of these finfings relatively easy to industry. Master...|$|E
40|$|Filtration is {{a widely}} used unit {{operation}} in chemical engineering. The huge variation in the properties of materials to be ltered makes the study of ltration a challenging task. One of the objectives of this thesis was to show that conventional ltration theories are di cult to use when the system to be modelled contains all of the stages and features that are present in a complete solid/liquid separation process. Furthermore, most of the ltration theories require experimental work to be performed {{in order to obtain}} critical parameters required by the theoretical models. Creating a good overall understanding of how the variables a ect the nal product in ltration is somewhat impossible on a purely theoretical basis. The complexity of solid/liquid separation processes require experimental work and when tests are needed, it is advisable to use experimental design techniques so that the goals can be achieved. The statistical design of experiments provides the necessary tools for recognising the e ects of variables. It also helps to perform experimental work more economically. Design of experiments is a prerequisite for creating empirical models that can describe how the measured response is related to the changes in the values of the variable. A software package was developed that provides a ltration practitioner with experimental designs and calculates the parameters for linear regression models, along with the graphical representation of the responses. The developed software consists of two software modules. These modules are LTDoE and LTRead. The LTDoE module is used to create experimental designs for di erent lter types. The lter types considered in the software are automatic vertical pressure lter, double-sided vertical pressure lter, horizontal membrane lter press, <b>vacuum</b> <b>belt</b> lter and ceramic capillary action disc lter. It is also possible to create experimental designs for those cases where the variables are totally user de ned, say for a customized ltration cycle or di erent piece of equipment. The LTRead-module is used to read the experimental data gathered from the experiments, to analyse the data and to create models for each of the measured responses. Introducing the structure of the software more in detail and showing some of the practical applications is the main part of this thesis. This approach to the study of cake ltration processes, as presented in this thesis, has been shown to have good practical value when making ltration tests...|$|E
40|$|As one of {{the most}} {{abundant}} elements on earth, iron is nearly always present in metal concentrates. This is specifically true for zinc sulphide concentrates, which can contain up to 18 % iron (marmatite). Today more than half of these concentrates are treated in hydrometallurgical- or combined hydrometallurgical¬pyrometallurgical circuits. In hydrometallurgical circuits, iron is solubilised (either in a roast-Ieach-, a direct leach- or bacterial leach circuit) along with zinc and must be removed from the zinc¬rich solution before the electrowinning- or solvent extraction step. Various iron removal processes were developed to address the iron problem in hydrometallurgical circuits. The better known of these include the jarosite-, goethite- and hematite processes also used in the zinc industry. Zincor (Zinc Corporation of South Africa) patented an iron removal process (Zincor Process), which was generally considered to be very similar to the so-called "para-goethite" iron removal process used only in two other zinc smelters notably Porto Vesme (Italy) and Pasminco Hobart (Tasmania). However, since the Zincor Process was patented in 1976, various changes have been made such as a change from a batch parallel to a continuous series process, a change in precipitation pH-profile and the introduction of a pH controlled acid wash in the second tank. The introduction of a weak acid leach step and <b>vacuum</b> <b>belt</b> filters at Zincor's residue treatment plant in the near future and an iron removal process that is not clearly understood, necessitated this further study of the Zincor iron removal process. The study has been conducted in three parts. The first part of the study has focused on the characterisation of the Zincor iron residue and the Zincor process. The second part of the study has been concerned with the definition of an optimum operating window in terms of the filterability of the residue and the third part investigated the use of neutralisation reagents other than zinc calcine to control the pH during iron precipitation. The distribution of iron in the Zincor iron precipitate, which usually contains between 35 % and 40 % iron, {{has been found to be}} as follows: approximately 45 % as schwertmannite, 5 % as ferrihydrite, 20 % as jarosites, 25 % as franklinite, trace amounts of pyrite as well as 5 % of an unknown phase. This confirmed that goethite is not present in the Zincor iron residue and that iron is mainly removed in the form of amorphous intermediate iron phases such as schwertmannite and ferrihydrite. Of these two phases, schwertmannite was the least expected as most work up until now were done on samples taken from natural environments. The following description of the conditions that promote iron removal, mainly as schwertmannite, is viewed as an expansion of the available literature data, which was gathered at ambient conditions. In terms of the main operating parameters, optimum filterability was achieved under the following conditions: pH of 3. 0, temperature as high as possible (70 °C) and at least 25 kg/m 3 seeding. A retention time of at least 4 hours at a pH of 3. 0 and 60 °C was required, which decreased by more than 50 % at a temperature of 70 °C. As these conditions mainly impact on the soluble zinc loss encountered during iron removal, an effort was made to further reduce the insoluble zinc loss, which is the inherent weakness in the Zincor process, and similar processes where zinc calcine is used for pH control, by investigating the use of alternative neutralisation reagents. This study showed that iron can be successfully removed with Ca(OH) 2, a basic zinc sulphate and zinc oxide mixture as well as chemically precipitated CaC 03 produced in the paper and pulp industry. Of these alternatives, CaC 03 appeared to be the most promising, with filtration rates an order of magnitude higher than the zinc oxide options (calcine and basic zinc sulphate mixture), due to better overall economics than with the use of Ca(OH) 2. Utilisation CaC 03 as an alternative neutralisation agent might increase the overall zinc recovery figure at Zincor by up to 1. 5 %. Based on the findings, it can be concluded that the Zincor process in its current form has a very distinct character compared to what was historically considered to be the very similar patented para-goethite iron removal process, as practiced at the Porto Vesme and the Pasminco Hobart hydrometallurgical zinc plants.
