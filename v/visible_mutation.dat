5000|$|Colonel Xavras Wyżryn is the {{commander}} of the AWP or Armia Wyzwolenia Polski (Polish Liberation Army), a considerable guerrilla force fighting the Soviet army in the European War Zone. His past is a mystery. He was born within the [...] "Atomic Triangle" [...] and has a <b>visible</b> <b>mutation</b> - the skin on his hands is red, as if burned. He was a junior officer in the Red Army, until he deserted and formed the AWP. He is a truly charismatic leader, inspiring his men to do unbelievable things, even sacrificing their lives for the [...] "higher cause". For the freedom of his country he is capable of killing everyone standing in his way, including women, children and even his own men, calling this a [...] "sacrifice for a better future". He is seen as a terrorist by the Soviets and as a romantic, tragic hero in the West. In the United States, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has even made a blockbuster movie about him, entitled [...] "Uncatchable". A major US news network signed a contract with Wyżryn, offering him $250 million for exclusive interviews and footage from battlefields. Xavras understands the importance of media and propaganda in modern warfare, so he censors the footage before it is sent to the network and makes himself a television celebrity.|$|E
40|$|Two genomic clones exhibiting a maternal-specific {{pattern of}} {{expression}} map to cytological region 52 A. To elucidate {{the function of}} these clones we have undertaken a mutagenesis of the cytological region 51 D- 52 A. This paper {{presents the results of}} this screen and the preliminary analysis of female-sterile and lethal mutations isolated. A total of twelve complementation groups have been identified, four of which are defined exclusively by female-sterile alleles. Only one <b>visible</b> <b>mutation</b> was isolated, a recessive temperature-sensitive allele of Thickened-arista (Ta(rts)). Several of the seven lethal loci display an embryonic lethal phase. Three of the four female-sterile loci affect chorion structure with one resulting in underamplification of the chorion genes, and two (possibly three) of the four female-steriles affect nuclear division/DNA replication. Thus it appears that this is a ``developmentally important'' region, possibly representing a clustering of genes involved in either DNA replication or nuclear division...|$|E
40|$|Chlorambucil induced {{a number}} of {{recessive}} visible mutations in the mouse. Induction of these mutations was studied in two mating schemes, each designed to recover mutations after two intercrosses. In scheme 1, 10 mutations were detected in 82 mice; in scheme 2, 1 mutation was detected in 19 mice. We have estimated {{that the proportion of}} gametes carrying a recessive <b>visible</b> <b>mutation</b> may be as high as 25 % after a dose of 10 mg of chlorambucil per kg to early spermatids. Seven of these mutations caused morphologically distinct abnormalities, including (i) a cerebellar abnormality similar to that expressed in homozygotes for the reeler (rl) mutation; (ii) open eyelids at birth; (iii) a rostral head hemangioma; (iv) abnormally small spleens, anemia, and umbilical hemorrhages; (v) immobility at birth; (vi) polycystic kidneys; and (vii) a circling behavior. Four additional mutations resulted in growth retardation and a runting syndrome. Because, in earlier studies, all molecularly characterized mutations induced by chlorambucil in poststem cells have proved to be deletions, these recessive visible mutations are probably deletions as well. These mutations may be useful in isolating and characterizing the genes responsible for the observed phenotypes...|$|E

40|$|We have {{conducted}} a genetic {{analysis of the}} region flanking the 68 C glue gene cluster in Drosophila melanogaster by isolating lethal and semilethal mutations uncovered by deficiencies which span this region. Three different mutagens were used: ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), ethyl nitrosourea (ENU) and diepoxybutane (DEB). In the region from 68 A 3 to 68 C 11, 64 lethal, semilethal, and <b>visible</b> <b>mutations</b> were recovered. These include alleles of 13 new lethal complementation groups, {{as well as new}} alleles of rotated, low xanthine dehydrogenase, letha 1 (3) 5 17 and lethal(31 B 76. Six new <b>visible</b> <b>mutations</b> from within this region were recovered {{on the basis of their}} reduced viability; all proved to be semiviable alleles of lethal complementation groups. No significant differences were observed in the distributions of lethals recovered using the three different mutagens. Each lethal was mapped on the basis of complementation with overlapping deficiencies; mutations that mapped within the same interval were tested for complementation, and the relative order of the lethal groups within eac...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous {{mutation}} {{rates at}} ten allozyme loci on chromosomes II and III of Drosophila melanogaster were studied. Over the {{three and a}} half years study, one α-GPD mutation and two different IDH mutations were obtained. The α-GPD mutation was inherited in the Mendelian fashion, as expected. The two IDH mutations were peculiar in that the band of new types appeared only in females. In males, only the original bands were stained, and the positions where mutant alleles' bands should be present were blank. Both IDH mutant homozygotes appeared as null allele homozygotes, while in females clear-cut single bands were present. —The rates of spontaneous mutation varied greatly. Eight loci studied (MDH, ADH, EST- 6, APH, EST-C, ODH, XDH, AO) did not give any germ-line mutation. The average germ-line mutation rate over all ten loci was estimated at 4. 5 x 10 - 6. This rate is considerably smaller than that for sex-linked recessive <b>visible</b> <b>mutations</b> (Muller, Valencia and Valencia 1950), but it is somewhat less than autosomal recessive <b>visible</b> <b>mutations</b> (Glass and Ritterhoff 1956) ...|$|R
40|$|A set of 1, 000 "mutation accumulation" {{lines of}} Drosophila melanogaster, which {{originated}} {{from two different}} wild-type, lethal-bearing second chromosomes (Yamaguchi and Mukai 1974; Mukai and Cockerham 1977), was examined for evidence of a mutator factor by using the occurrence of recessive visible mutations and male recombination to identify its presence. The 1, 000 lines were screened at approximately generation 240 {{for the presence of}} recessive visible mutations at twelve loci, by outcrossing to a balanced multiply marked second chromosome stock (Muller's " 12 ple" Bowling Green). Twenty-three lines were found to carry a <b>visible</b> <b>mutation</b> at one of the loci. Seventeen of these lines carried a mutation of either the dp or the vg locus. Mutations found in three lines, two at the dp locus and one at the vg locus, demonstrated instability as revertants to the wild type and were recovered and verified in these three cases. The three revertant lines, and three lines showing no reversion, were tested for their ability to induce male recombination. Male recombination was observed in the three lines in which revertants were recovered. Male and female sterility assays indicated conclusively that these "hybrid dysgenic" characteristics could not be used to identify lines potentially carrying mutator factors, whereas the consistent ability of the lines to induce high rates of reversion and male recombination was successful in determining that the "mutation accumulation lines" do possess mutator factors...|$|E
40|$|We {{established}} a genetic linkage map employing 518 {{simple sequence repeat}} (SSR, or microsatellite) markers for Bombyx mori (silkworm), the economically and culturally important lepidopteran insect, {{as part of an}} international genomics program. A survey of six representative silkworm strains using 2, 500 (CA) n- and (CT) n-based SSR markers revealed 17 - 24 % polymorphism, indicating a high degree of homozygosity resulting from a long history of inbreeding. Twenty-nine SSR linkage groups were established in well characterized Dazao and C 108 strains based on genotyping of 189 backcross progeny derived from an F 1 male mated with a C 108 female. The clustering was further focused to 28 groups by genotyping 22 backcross progeny derived from an F 1 female mated with a C 108 male. This set of SSR linkage groups was further assigned to the 28 chromosomes (established linkage groups) of silkworm aided by visible mutations and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers developed from previously mapped genes, cDNA sequences, and cloned random amplified polymorphic DNAs. By integrating a <b>visible</b> <b>mutation</b> p (plain, larval marking) and 29 well conserved genes of insects onto this SSR-based linkage map, a second generation consensus silkworm genetic map with a range of 7 - 40 markers per linkage group and a total map length of ≈ 3431. 9 cM was constructed and its high efficiency for genotyping and potential application for synteny studies of Lepidoptera and other insects was demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|The alkylating {{compounds}} and strong mutagens methylnitrosourea (MNU) and ethylnitrosourea (ENU) {{were used to}} widen the genetic variability of pea (Pisum sativum L.) via experimental mutagenesis. Amongst multiple mutations of agronomical interest, {{for the first time}} two mutations conferring broad-range resistance to powdery mildew (Erysiphe pisi Syd.) were induced in pea. Mutagenic treatments were carried out on seedlings using a technique that ensures very high mutagenic efficiency. Two-hour exposure of cv. Solara seedlings to chemical mutagens resulted in almost non noticeable lethality and sterility in the M 1 generation and very high mutation rates: ~ 39 % families with visible mutations in the M 2 generation. The influence of the cell cycle phase on the process of mutagenesis was studied in cv. Frilene using a previously developed technique for synchronization of shoot apical meristem cells. The cell cycle phase at which cells were treated apparently did not influence the lethality and sterility in the M 1 generation, while the <b>visible</b> <b>mutation</b> rate, assessed in the M 2 generation, showed a clear cell cycle dependency. Seedlings treated at the G 2 and M phases gave rise to progenies exhibiting the highest mutation rate, over 50 % of M 2 families with visible mutations. The powdery mildew resistant (PMR) mutant S(er 1 mut 1) was induced by treatment of cv. Solara seedlings for 2 h with ENU, while the PMR mutant F(er 1 mut 2) was induced by treatment of cv. Frilene seedlings with the same chemical mutagen for 1 h during the G 2 phase of the cell cycle. The genetic analysis of the novel PMR mutant lines showed that both resistances are inherited as monogenic recessive traits. The performed genetic complementation analyses revealed that both mutations affect the same locus-er 1, which determines most of the natural sources of PMR in pea. A project aiming at the isolation of the powdery mildew resistance mutated gene via map based cloning is currently under way. © The Author(s) 2009...|$|E

Crosses between geographically separated populations, however, lead {{to the release of}} mutator activity as measured by a significant increase in <b>visible</b> <b>mutations.</b> Such an increase in mutation in hybrid individuals may be a powerful factor in inducing or releasing variation in nature, and in more extreme instances may contribute to the separation of microdifferentiated populations...|$|R

40|$|Hybrid dysgenesis is a {{syndrome}} of germ-line aberrations including, e. g., sterility and mutation, {{found in}} certain interstrain hybrids of Drosophila melanogaster. Previous studies of sterility {{have shown that}} elements responsible for dysgenesis may reside on all major chromosomes, but that their dysgenesis-causing ability is controlled by an unknown extrachromosomal factor. Dysgenic hybrids also give rise to unstable <b>visible</b> <b>mutations</b> thought to be DNA insertions at certain sensitive loci. One such unstable allele at the singed bristle locus, designated snw, was found to mutate at extraordinary rates exceeding 50 %. This instability was shown {{to be under the}} same extrachromosomal control as hybrid dysgenesis itself. That is, the mutability of snw was reversibly suppressed when placed in the background cytotype known to prevent sterility and other characteristics of hybrid dysgenesis. These results suggest that snw may represent an insertion at the singed locus of a hypothetical gene responsible for hybrid dysgenesis...|$|R
40|$|A {{considerable}} {{proportion of}} <b>visible</b> <b>mutations</b> {{is reported to}} be caused by the insertion of mobile genetic elements in Drosophila and other organisms. We estimated transposition rates of some Drosophila mobile elements by using the lines AW and JH in which spontaneous mutations have been accumulated independently for about 400 generations. Occupied sites of the mobile elements were detected by in situ hybridization on the salivary gland chromosomes sampled from 40 AW and 30 JH lines. The rates of insertion and excision of the copia and two copia-like elements, 412 and 17. 6, are very low: Insertions occurred at up to 10 (- 3) per second chromosome per generation (17. 6) and excision occurred at about 10 (- 5) per site per generation (copia and 412). Insertions of the I and hobo elements occurred much more frequently. These estimates are not only important for assessing the actual rate of various types of mutations but also for developing an evolutionary theory of mobile elements themselves...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} β 3 -tubulin gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a divergent isoform expressed in a complex developmental pattern. The β 3 gene is transiently expressed in the embryo {{and again in the}} pupa at high levels in the developing musculature, and at lower levels in several different pupal tissues of ectodermal origin. Adult expression is confined to specific somatic cells in the gonads. In some of the cell types in which it is expressed, β 3 is the sole or predominant β-tubulin, while in other the β 3 protein is a minor component of the β-tubulin pool. The sites and timing of β 3 expression demonstrated that β-tubulin is utilized primarily in cytoplasmic microtubule arrays involved in changes in cell shape and tissue organization, and suggested to us that this isoform may be functionally specialized. To determine whether the expression of the β 3 gene is essential for normal development, and to examine the specific functions of this divergent isoform, we have generated mutations within the gene. We determined that the small deficiency Df(2 R) Px(2), which deletes the 60 C 5, 6 - 60 D 9, 10 region of chromosome 2, removes all of the β 3 coding sequences, and that the distal breakpoint of the deficiency is approximately 2 kb upstream from the start of transcription of the β 3 gene. We have generated a total of 31 ethyl methanesulfonate- or diepoxy-butane-induced recessive lethal or <b>visible</b> <b>mutations</b> which map within the deficiency. These mutations define 12 new lethal complementation groups, which together with two previously identified <b>visible</b> <b>mutations,</b> altogether identify 14 genes in this interval of the second chromosome. A lethal complementation group comprising mutations in the β 3 -tubulin gene (βTub 60 D) was identified by rescue of their lethality by a wild-type copy of the gene introduced into the genome via P element-mediated germ line transformation. Analysis of the homozygous and transheterozygous phenotypes of the five β 3 mutations recovered (alleles designated B 3 t(1) -B 3 t(5)) demonstrates that β 3 -tubulin is essential for viability and fertility...|$|R
40|$|In their {{remarkable}} paper {{dealing with}} the production of chromosome aberrations by cyanide, Lilly and Thoday (9) also reported a cyanide effect in conjunction with x-ray treatments. In contrast {{to the production of}} aberrations by cyanide itself, the effect on x-ray breakage occurred only when the treatments were performed in the absence of oxygen. The cyanide effect consisted of an increased frequency of chromosome breakage by x-rays under anaerobic conditions (Lilly, personal communication). Prior to the publication of these results by Lilly and Thoday, conflicting reports had been made about the effect of cyanide on the production of mutations and chromosome aberrations by x-rays. D'Amato and Gustafsson (2) found that pretreatments with low concentrations of potassium cyanide (10 [...] 4 to 10 [...] 8 ~t) increased the frequency of <b>visible</b> <b>mutations</b> produced by a given dose of x-rays in barley.

40|$|A yellow-eyed mutant was {{discovered}} in a strain of Heliothis virescens, the tobacco budworm, that already exhibited a mutation for yellow scale, y. We investigated the inheritance of these <b>visible</b> <b>mutations</b> as candidate markers for transgenesis. Yellow eye was controlled by a single, recessive, autosomal factor, {{the same type of}} inheritance previously known for y. Presence of the recombinant mutants with yellow scales and wild type eyes in test crosses indicated independent segregation of genes for these traits. The recombinant class with wild type scales and yellow eyes was completely absent and there was a corresponding increase of the double mutant parental class having yellow scales and yellow eyes. These results indicated that a single factor for yellow eye also controlled yellow scales independently of y. This gene was named yes, for yellow eye and scale. We hypothesize that yes controls both eye and scale color through a deficiency in transport of pigment precursors in both the ommochrome and melanin pathways. The unlinked gene y likely controls an enzyme affecting the melanin pathway only. Both y and yes segregated independently of AceIn, acetylcholinesterase insensitivity, and sodium channel hscp, which are genes related to insecticide resistance...|$|R

Visibly marked deficiencies (deletions) are used in mapping studies and region-specific mutagenesis screens by providing segmental haploidy required to uncover recessive mutations. Marked recessive lethal inversions are used as balancer chromosomes to maintain recessive lethal mutations and to maintain the integrity of mutagenized chromosomes. In mice, studies on series of radiation-induced deletions that surround several <b>visible</b> <b>mutations</b> have yielded invaluable functional genomic information in the regions analyzed.

Using a deficiency of the 67 A 2 to 67 D 11 - 13 region, Df(3 L) AC 1, we screened 8700 diepoxybutane-treated chromosomes and 7800 ethyl methanesulfonate-treated chromosomes for <b>visible</b> and lethal <b>mutations</b> throughout this interval and recovered 74 independent recessive lethal <b>mutations,</b> but no <b>visible</b> <b>mutations.</b> One of the lethal mutations, d 29 A 6, was identified as an overlapping deficiency extending from 66 F 3 to 67 B 1. An additional 6000 diepoxybutane-treated chromosomes were screened for lethality over d 29 A 6, yielding another four lethal mutations within the 67 A 2 -B 1 subinterval. These 78 lethal mutations, along with two others isolated in other laboratories, define 23 essential loci [...] 6 within the 67 A 2 -B 1 subinterval and 17 within the 67 A 2 to D 11 - 13 subinterval. Many of these loci appear to be required for imaginal development only, exhibiting late larval to pharate adult lethal phases. Examination of the 67 A 2 -B 1 lethal complementation groups for (1) earlier onset of lethality following a heat shock, (2) missing or altered small hsps on two-dimensional protein gels, and (3) restoration of viability by transformed wild-type copies of the small hsp genes indicates {{that none of these}} mutations affect the small hsps.

40|$|A new {{example of}} ``hybrid dysgenesis'' has been {{demonstrated}} in the F(1) progeny of crosses between two different strains of Drosophila virilis. The dysgenic traits were observed only in hybrids obtained when wild-type females (of the Batumi strain 9 from Georgia, USSR) were crossed to males from a marker strain (the long-established laboratory strain, strain 160, carrying recessive markers on all its autosomes). The phenomena observed include high frequencies {{of male and female}} sterility, male recombination, chromosomal nondisjunction, transmission ratio distortion and the appearance of numerous <b>visible</b> <b>mutations</b> at different loci in the progeny of dysgenic crosses. The sterility demonstrated in the present study {{is similar to that of}} P-M dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster and apparently results from underdevelopment of the gonads in both sexes, this phenomenon being sensitive to developmental temperature. However, in contrast to the P-M and I-R dysgenic systems in D. melanogaster, in D. virilis the highest level of sterility (95 - 98 %) occurs at 23 - 25 °. Several of the mutations isolated from the progeny of dysgenic crosses (e. g., singed) proved to be unstable and reverted to wild type. We hypothesize that a mobile element (``Ulysses'') which we have recently isolated from a dysgenically induced white eye mutation may be responsible for the phenomena observed...|$|R

The Drosophila amontillado (amon) gene encodes a homolog of the mammalian PC 2 protein, an SPC that functions in the regulated secretory pathway in neuroendocrine tissues. We have identified amon mutants by isolating ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) -induced lethal and <b>visible</b> <b>mutations</b> that define two complementation groups in the amon interval at 97 D 1 of the third chromosome.

Mutant larvae can be rescued by heat-shock-induced expression of the amon protein. Rescued larvae arrest at the subsequent larval molt, suggesting that amon is also required for the second to third instar larval molt. Our data indicate that the amon proprotein convertase is required during embryogenesis and larval development in Drosophila and support the hypothesis that AMON acts to proteolytically process peptide hormones that regulate hatching, larval growth, and larval ecdysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{transposable element}} mariner {{is active in}} both {{germline}} and somatic cells of Drosophila mauritiana. Activity of the element is greatly enhanced {{in the presence of}} Mos 1, a genetic factor identified as an autonomous copy of mariner. A strain of D. mauritiana containing Mos 1 and other copies of mariner was used to initiate a screen for <b>visible</b> <b>mutations.</b> More than 20 mutations were obtained, including alleles of white, yellow and vermilion. Six alleles were characterized at the molecular level, and all were found to contain a mariner element inserted into the affected gene. Four insertions into the white locus were sequenced to determine the exact site of insertion of mariner. There appears to be little sequence specificity requirement for mariner insertion, other than an absolute requirement for the dinucleotide TA, which is duplicated upon insertion. Sequences of phenotypically wild-type germline and somatic revertants obtained from various white alleles, including the previously isolated w(pch) allele, were obtained using the polymerase chain reaction. Mariner excision is imprecise in both germline and soma, and the most frequent excision events are the same in the two tissues. Mutant derivatives of w(pch) were also studied, and were found to exhibit a wide range of molecular structures and phenotypes...|$|R
40|$|A refined {{functional}} map of a 6 - to 11 -centimorgan region {{surrounding the}} albino (c) locus in mouse chromosome 7 is being generated by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (EtNU) "saturation" mutagenesis of stem-cell spermatogonia. In {{the first phase}} of an experiment that will eventually test at least 3000 gametes, we screened 972 mutagenized gametes for the induction of both lethal and <b>visible</b> <b>mutations</b> with a two-cross breeding protocol. Thirteen mutations mapping within the limits of a segment corresponding to the cytologically visible Df(c Mod- 2 sh- 1) 26 DVT deletion were recovered. They represented three phenotypic groups: prenatal lethality (six mutations); a fitness/runting syndrome (three mutations, provisionally designated as fit variants); and a neurological/balance-defect abnormality (four mutations). Complementation analysis provided evidence for a true repeat mutation at the sh- 1 (shaker- 1) locus (for the neurological mutations) and another at the here defined fit- 1 (fitness- 1) locus. In addition, four complementation groups were defined by induced lethal mutations; the two other lethal mutations were each part of a cluster. The recovery of the repeat mutations suggests that the EtNU-induced mutation rate, estimated from specific-locus tests, should make it possible to achieve saturation mutagenesis of a chromosomal region. This experiment is providing basic logistical and statistical information on which to base strategies for expanding the functional map of larger segments of the mouse genome by experimental mutagenesis. It is also yielding additional mutations useful in dissecting the functional and molecular complexity of this segment of chromosome 7...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} {{to determine the effects of}} <b>visible</b> <b>mutations</b> of large effect on developmental stability and canalization in different morphological traits, namely, sternopleural bristle number, wing length, wing to thorax ratio, ovariole number, and sex comb tooth number (SCTN) in Drosophila ananassae. We have compared the mean trait size, fluctuating asymmetry (FA) (as an index of developmental stability), and morphological variation (as an index of canalization) of different mutant strains (yellow body color, y; claret eye color, ca; plexus wing, px; spread wing, spr; ebony body and sepia eye color, e se; yellow body and claret eye color, y ca; and cardinal eye color, curled wing, and ebony body color, cd cu e) with wild-type strain. The mean trait size of all morphological traits differs significantly among the wild-type and mutant strains. The wild-type and mutant strains vary significantly for the morphological variation and also for the levels of the FA in different morphological traits. However, we have found no increase in either the variance or in the degree of FA with the increase of the mutations (except in SCTN in y mutant). The plausible reasons for the variation in wild-type and mutant strains with particular reference to developmental stability and canalization have been discussed. Phenotypic variations provide the raw material for evolution on which natural selection acts, but understanding its nature and generation is an important challenge for evolutionar...|$|R
40|$|Irradiation data involve {{sampling}} distributions {{which are}} binomial and depend on probabilities less than. 01. The chi-square test {{has been shown}} to be valid for such data even when the expected numbers are as low as 0. 5, whereas it is known that the normal theory breaks down under these conditions;New data were obtained on <b>visible</b> <b>mutations</b> at nineteen loci on the first three chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster. These data were analysed by the chi-square test on the basis of these hypotheses: (1) that the genes within the sets observed have the same basic mutation rate, (2) that the mutation rate at a specific locus is directly proportional to the dosage of radiation applied, (3) that if the sets of genes used are representative of their respective chromosomes, the fundamental rates of mutation on those chromosomes are the same, and (4) that for a particular gene and a fixed dosage, the wave-length of x-ray used does not affect the mutation rate. Our data indicate that the first hypothesis is inadequate to explain the variation observed when the 2 ̆ 2 ct 2 ̆ 2 locus is among those observed, but the other hypotheses fit the data quite satisfactorily;Other sets of data were analysed by chi-square as illustrations of methodology. These data were on the following subjects: (1) continuous versus interrupted irradiation (from Patterson, 1931), (2) reverse mutations (from Timofeeff-Ressovsky, 1932), (3) the production of mutations by heat (from Buchmann and Timofeeff-Ressovsky, 1936), and (4) comparison of mutation rates among the species Drosophila funebris, Drosophila melanogaster, and Drosophila simulans (from Timofeeff-Ressovsky, 1937) ...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, {{little was}} {{known of the}} genetic {{constitution}} of the heterochromatic segments of the major autosomes of Drosophila melanogaster. Our previous report described the genetic dissection of the proximal, heterochromatic region of chromosome 2 of Drosophila melanogaster {{by means of a}} series of overlapping deficiencies generated by the detachment of compound second autosomes (Hilliker and Holm 1975). Analysis of these deficiencies by inter se complementation, pseudo-dominance tests with proximal mutations and allelism tests with known deficiencies provided evidence for the existence of at least two loci between the centromere and the light locus in 2 L and one locus in 2 R between the rolled locus and the centromere. These data in conjunction with cytological observations demonstrated that light and rolled and three loci lying between them are located within the proximal heterochromatin of the second chromosome. ——The present report describes the further analysis of this region through the induction with ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS) of recessive lethals allelic to the 2 L and 2 R proximal deficiencies associated with the detachment products. Analysis of the 118 EMS-induced recessive lethals and <b>visible</b> <b>mutations</b> recovered provided evidence for seven loci in the 2 L heterochromatin and six loci in the 2 R heterochromatin, with multiple alleles being obtained for most sites. Of these loci, one in 2 L and two in 2 R fall near the heterochromatic-euchromatic junctions of 2 L and 2 R respectively. None of the 113 EMS lethals behaved as a deficiency, implying that the heterochromatic loci uncovered in this study represent nonrepetitive cistrons. Thus functional genetic loci are found in heterochromatin, albeit at a very low density relative to euchromatin...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we address}} the {{question}} of whether there exist major genes that cause complete male sterility in the interspecific hybrids of Drosophila and, if they do, how these genes may be characterized at the molecular level. Our approach is to introgress small segments of the X chromosome from Drosophila mauritiana (or Drosophila sechellia) into Drosophila simulans by repeated backcrosses for more than 20 generations. The introgressions are monitored by both <b>visible</b> <b>mutations</b> and a series of DNA markers. We compare the extent of introgressions that cause male sterility with those that do not. If a major sterility factor exists, there should be a sharp boundary between these two classes of introgressions and their breakpoints should demarcate such a gene. Furthermore, if male sterility is the only major fitness effect associated with the introgression, recombination analysis should yield a pattern predicted by the classical three-point cross. Both the genetic and molecular analyses suggest the presence of a major sterility factor from D. mauritiana, which we named Odysseus (Ods), in the cytological interval of 16 D. We thus formalize three criteria for inferring the existence of a major gene within an introgression: (1) complete penetrance of sterility, (2) complementarity in recombination analysis, and (3) physical demarcation. Introgressions of Ods from D. sechellia do not cause sterility. Twenty-two introgressions in our collection have breakpoints in this interval of about 500 kb, making it possible to delineate Ods more precisely for molecular identification. The recombination analysis also reveals the complexity of the introgressed segments [...] even relatively short ones may contain a second male sterility factor and partial viability genes and may also interfere with crossovers. The spermatogenic defects associated with Ods and/or a second factor were characterized by phase-contrast microscopy...|$|R
