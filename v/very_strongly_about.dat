25|$|Lastly, the British felt {{disenchanted with}} Indian {{reaction}} to social change. Until the rebellion, they had enthusiastically pushed through social reform, like {{the ban on}} sati by Lord William Bentinck. It was now felt that traditions and customs in India were too strong and too rigid to be changed easily; consequently, no more British social interventions were made, especially in matters dealing with religion, even when the British felt <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> the issue (as in the instance of the remarriage of Hindu child widows). This was exemplified further in Queen Victoria's Proclamation released immediately after the rebellion. The proclamation stated that 'We disclaim alike our Right and Desire to impose Our Convictions on any of Our Subjects'; demonstrating official British commitment to abstaining from social intervention in India.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{models for}} random interval graphs {{that are based}} on stochastic service systems, with vertices corresponding to customers and edges corresponding to pairs of customers that are in the system simultaneously. The number N of vertices in a connected component thus corresponds to the number of customers arriving during a busy period, while the size K of the largest clique (which for interval graphs is equal to the chromatic number) corresponds to the maximum number of customers in the system during a busy period. We obtain the following results for both the M=D= 1 and the M=M= 1 models, with arrival rate per mean service time. The expected number of vertices is e, and the distribution of the N=e tends to an exponential distribution with mean 1 as tends to infinity. This implies that log N is <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> concentrated <b>about</b> Γ fl (where fl is Euler's constant), with variance just 2 = 6.

40|$|The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change {{concluded}} {{that there can be}} “no doubt” the economic risks of business-as-usual (BAU) climate change are “very severe” [Stern, 2006. The Economics of Climate Change. HM Treasury, London, p. 188]. The total cost of climate change was estimated to be equivalent to a one-off, permanent 5 – 20 % loss in global mean per-capita consumption today. And the marginal damage cost of a tonne of carbon emitted today was estimated to be around $ 312 [p. 344]. Both of these estimates are higher than most reported in the previous literature. Subsequently, a number of critiques have appeared, arguing that discounting is the principal explanation for this discrepancy. Discounting is important, but in this paper we emphasise that how one approaches the economics of risk and uncertainty, and how one attempts to model the very closely related issue of low-probability/high-damage scenarios (which we connect to the recent discussion of ‘dangerous’ climate change), can matter just as much. We demonstrate these arguments empirically, using the same models applied in the Stern Review. Together, the issues of risk and uncertainty on the one hand, and ‘dangerous’ climate change on the other, raise <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> questions <b>about</b> the limits of a welfare-economic approach, where the loss of natural capital might be irreversible and impossible to compensate. Thus we also critically reflect on the state-of-the-art in integrated assessment modelling. There will always be an imperative to carry out integrated assessment modelling, bringing together scientific ‘fact’ and value judgement systematically. But we agree with those cautioning against a literal interpretation of current estimates. Ironically, the Stern Review is one of those voices. A fixation with cost-benefit analysis misses the point that arguments for stabilisation should, and are, built on broader foundations...|$|R

40|$|Twenty-six {{people with}} mild {{intellectual}} disabilities and challenging behaviour, who {{had all been}} service-users at a specialist, hospital-based unit, were interviewed after they had left the service {{for an average of}} four and a half years, about their current quality of life and their memories of the service. On the whole, people were still living in the community though many had had a large number of placement moves (and some had returned to hospital or prison). The service-user's overall quality of life in their current placement was as good as that of the general population in the less restrictive environments but fell increasingly short of this standard as the placements became more restrictive. Even in the best placements people's social relationships appeared impaired when compared to the general population. With respect to their memories of the specialist service, it appeared that, despite the time period, service-users had a clear memory of the service, appreciated many aspects of it (such as the help staff provided, the therapy and education), were divided about some aspects (such as having to be in hospital, being detained under the Mental Health Act 1983, taking medication) and had <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> negative feelings <b>about</b> aspects of the care which directly restricted their liberty (such as the locking of the front door, the use of restraint and seclusion).

[...] After reading the script, Whitford said he loved the character immediately and [...] "desperately wanted" [...] the part. While his audition impressed the show's executive producers, with Sorkin describing it as [...] "simply the best audition for anything I'd ever seen," [...] Warner Brothers casting director John Levey was not convinced Whitford had enough sex appeal to play a lead character and executive producer Thomas Schlamme was concerned {{that he did not}} have enough depth to carry off the more dramatic scenes.

[...] "I just said, 'Aaron, I just feel this <b>very</b> <b>strongly.</b> This isn't <b>about</b> me wanting a job. This is the only time in my life I will play this card. I am this guy; I am not the other guy.'" [...] Sorkin was impressed, and soon after Whitford was cast as Josh. In the very early episodes of the series, Josh is portrayed as overly tough and outspoken, but mellows by the end of the first season, becoming more eager and simplistic in his personal demeanor, even switching places with Toby as the [...] "hot-headed" [...] one.|$|R

60|$|Our robust {{political}} sense, {{which has}} discovered {{so many of}} the secrets of good government, which has given us freedom with order, and popular administration without corruption, and unalterable respect for law along with indelible respect for individual right, this, which has so long been our strong point, is fast becoming our weakness and undoing. For the extension of the ways of thinking which are proper in politics, to other than political matter, means {{at the same time the}} depravation of the political sense itself. Not only is social expediency effacing the many other points of view that men ought to take of the various facts of life and thought: the idea of social expediency itself is becoming a dwarfed and pinched idea. Ours is the country where love of constant improvement ought to be greater than anywhere else, because fear of revolution is less. Yet the art of politics is growing to be as meanly conceived as all the rest At elections the national candidate has not often a chance against the local candidate, nor the man of a principle against the man of a class. In parliament we are admonished on high authority that 'the policy of a party is not the carrying out of the opinion of any section of it, but the general consensus of the whole,' which seems to be a hierophantic manner of saying that the policy of a party is one thing, and the principle which makes it a party is another thing, and that men who care <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> anything are to surrender that and the hope of it, for the sake of succeeding in something about which they care very little or not at all. This is our modern way of giving politicians heart for their voyage, of inspiring them with resoluteness and self-respect, with confidence in the worth of their cause and enthusiasm for its success. Thoroughness is a mistake, and nailing your flag to the mast a bit of delusive heroics. Think wholly of to-day, and not at all of to-morrow. Beware of the high and hold fast to the safe.
