40|$|In {{this paper}} {{different}} approaches for digital video recording in vehicles are examined, with weight on video quality. Different video compression algorithms were gone through and the conclusion was that inter-frame compression, like MPEG video delivers better video quality than intra-frame algorithms, for example Wavelet. The main drawback {{is that it}} is difficult to extract single frames, which leads to difficulties when for example backwards-playability is needed. To demonstrate how digital video recording can be done a demonstrator was built. Therefore, when the decision to use MPEG compression was made, a market research was done and a <b>video</b> <b>grabber</b> expansion card for PCs was bought. The report describes the hardware and software developments that had to be made to run the video recorder. The result of the thesis was this report and a functioning recorder.

The aim of our study was to prove the concept of 3 D ultrasound on the basis of technical and human effects. A 3 D-ultrasound navigation system consisting of a standard personal computer containing a <b>video</b> <b>grabber</b> card in combination with an optical tracking system (NDI Polaris) and a standard ultrasound device (Siemens Omnia) with a 7. 5 MHz probe was used. 3 D-iUS datasets were acquired after craniotomy, at different subsequent times of the procedure and overlaid with preoperative MRI. All patients underwent early postoperative 3 D MRI including contrast agent within 24 hours after surgery. Acquisition of 3 D iUS and the fusion with preoperative MRI was successful in 22 / 23 patients. The expenditure of time was at least 5 minutes for one intraoperative 3 D US dataset. The technique was used three to seven times during surgery. The quality of the ultrasound images was superior in cases of metastasis, meningeoma and angioma over those in malignant glioma. Brain shifting ranged from 2 - 25 mm depending on localization and kind of tumor. A resection control was possible in 78 %. All six neurosurgeons demonstrated a learning curve. The introduction of 3 D ultrasound has increased the value of neuronavigation substantially, making it possible to update several times during surgery and minimize the problem of brain shift. Configuration of both the 3 D iUS based on a standard ultrasound system and the MR navigation system is time- and especially cost-effective.

A combination of preoperative MRI with intraoperative 3 D-ultrasound (3 D-iUS) may enhance {{the convenience of}} neuronavigation by adding intraoperative information. The aim of our study was to evaluate fusion accuracy, the benefit of 3 D-iUS navigation for the extent of resection and the suitability of iUS for detection and capture of intraoperative brain shift. Methods: A freehand 3 D ultrasound navigation system consisting of a standard personal computer containing a <b>video</b> <b>grabber</b> card in combination with an optical tracking system (NDI Polaris) and a standard ultrasound device (Siemens Omnia) with a 5. 0 MHz probe was used. 3 D-iUS datasets were acquired after craniotomy, at different subsequent times of the procedure and overlayed with preoperative MRI. All patients underwent early postoperative 3 D-MRI including contrast agen t within 24 h after surgery. Results: Acquisition of 3 D-iUS and the fusion with preoperative MRI was successful in 22 / 23 patients. The expenditure of time was at least 5 minutes for one 3 D-iUS dataset and was used three to seven times during surgery. The quality of ultrasound images was superior in cases of metastasis, meningeoma and angioma to those in malignant glioma.

40|$|Introduction: Based on the {{invasive}} studies it {{has been}} shown that factors such as age, the progress of eye disorders, lens fibers compression and the biochemical changes of ocular matrix alter the physical characteristics and elastic properties of eye. In this study, a noninvasive method of estimating human eye elasticityis proposed and its relation with age and gender is evaluated using ultrasound images. Materials and Methods: To estimate eye elasticity, an especial loading system was designed and an external stress of 2614 ± 146 Pa which is less than the intraocular pressure of eye was applied to 20 eyes in an in vivo study. The pressure was measured using digital force gauge. The ultrasound images of B-mode were acquired prior to and post applying the stress. For the offline study throughout the loading process, the ultrasound images were saved as multi-frames into the computer by <b>video</b> <b>grabber</b> board. Monitoring, saving and further study of images were provided for the extraction of eye axial length and posterior wall thickness (PWT). The elasticity was estimated by measuring the relative changes of the axial length of eye, the posterior wall thickness and the applied stress. The statistical correlation of elastic modulus was analyzed based on age and gender. Results: The elastic modulus of the eye and the posterior wall thickness was estimated to be 51, 777 ± 27304 and 14603 ± 4636 Pa, respectively. The obtained results indicated that there was no significant difference between the elastic parameters of the eye and the posterior wall thickness based on gender in both male and female group. The correlation analysis of the elastic parameter showed that there was significant difference between the eye and the posterior wall thickness based on age with a 95 % confidence interval. Discussion and Conclusion: Based on the results obtained in this study the ultrasonic instruments might be used to estimate the hardness of eye lesions as well as eye posterior wall thickness...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Spatial {{planning}} decisions (borders {{of protected}} areas, locations of infrastructure, etc.) are {{often based on}} insufficient data as costs of in situ measurements (diving, <b>video,</b> <b>grab</b> sampling) are too high to cover larger areas and {{there is often a}} shortage of trained personnel. On the other hand, model simulations show that water depth and broad taxonomic groups of benthic algae (e. g. red, green and brown algae) can be mapped using remote sensing methods in optically complex coastal waters. In the present study we mapped the distribution of benthic macroalgae and invertebrates using traditional diving, a remote underwater video device and airborne (CASI) remote sensing in a brackish water habitat. Using statistical relationships between traditional and modern mapping techniques we built a GIS spatial model capable of predicting water depth, cover of algae and broad types of macroalgal habitats in optically complex coastal waters. The models were published on the internet through a standard protocol of web map services. Such spatial planning tool combining strong sides of different methods enables integrated and more efficient management of the studied coastal sea. Relying solely on remote sensing without extensive field survey may not provide sufficient detail in some cases. Therefore, remote sensing has been recommended as a complementary technology (Green et al., 2000). Our aim is to develop GIS-based tool that combines of remote sensing, in situ data, and spatial modelling into a spatial planning and coastal monitoring tool...|$|R
