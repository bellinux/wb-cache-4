50|$|Slavín is a {{memorial}} monument and military cemetery in Bratislava, {{the capital of}} Slovakia. It is the burial ground of thousands of Soviet Army soldiers who fell during World War II while liberating the city in April 1945 from the occupying German Wehrmacht units and the remaining Slovak troops who supported the clero-fascist Tiso government.

50|$|The {{more recent}} history of Feldafing begins with the {{construction}} of the railway line in 1864. The former fishing and farming village was transformed. Around the turn of the 20th century, a <b>Villa</b> <b>quarter</b> arose in Feldafing. In 1890 there were approximately 70 houses in Feldafing, and in 1933 there were more than 170. Between 1890 and 1933 the population more than doubled, totaling 1,185 people in 1933. Another population boom took place after World War II through an influx of refugees and displaced persons.|$|E
5000|$|Bühlau's {{municipal}} area {{is divided}} into multiple parts. In the southeast is the former quarter Quohren. In the centre, at the Ullersdorfer Platz/Quohrener Strasse (lit. Ullersdorf Place/Quohren Street) is the village core located in a shallow hollow, the old Oberdorf (altes Oberdorf). With the neighbouring village of Quohren, it enjoys a common protection status because of the still existing ancient village buildings in the [...] "preservation statute for historic village centres {{in the city of}} Dresden." [...] The residential area (<b>villa</b> <b>quarter)</b> of New Buehlau (Neubühlau) is located in the north and west.|$|E
50|$|All {{the ships}} have names of Saxon {{towns and cities}} or Saxon people like August the Strong. The ships connect Meißen via Dresden to Saxon Switzerland along the river Elbe where they pass some {{remarkable}} castles, vineyards and <b>villa</b> <b>quarters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nearby, two cable {{railways}} connect Körnerplatz {{with two}} <b>villa</b> <b>quarters.</b> The Standseilbahn Dresden is a funicular railway which travels up 95 metres and connects {{the districts of}} Loschwitz and Weißer Hirsch. The Schwebebahn Dresden is the oldest suspension railway {{in the world and}} connects the lower and upper parts of Loschwitz.|$|R
50|$|Buehlau (German: Bühlau) is {{a quarter}} {{in the east}} of the Saxon capital Dresden and belongs to the {{statistical}} quarter Buehlau/Weisser Hirsch. It lies in the outside of the Elbe valley between the Dresden Heath and the Schoenfeld Upland. It was first mentioned in 1349, in 1839 it formed a country commune together with Quohren and in 1921 it became incorporated into Dresden. Today, Buehlau is part of one of the Dresden <b>villa</b> <b>quarters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Barrandov is a {{neighbourhood}} in south-west Prague, Czech Republic, {{located in}} the cadastral district of Hlubočepy, in Prague 5. It is situated on and around some rock formations above the Vltava River. Barrandov {{is known for its}} film industry and the film studios {{located in the}} old part of the district. The Czech national television services Nova and Barrandov TV broadcast from here. Old Barrandov consists of the <b>villa</b> <b>quarter,</b> Barrandov Terraces and Barrandov Studios, and New Barrandov is located {{to the west of the}} old part. Barrandov has a population of about 20,000. A new tram line into New Barrandov was built in 2003.|$|E
50|$|Loschwitz is a borough (Ortsamtsbereich) of Dresden, Germany, {{incorporated}} in 1921. It consists of ten quarters (Stadtteile):Loschwitz is a <b>villa</b> <b>quarter</b> {{located at the}} slopes north of the Elbe river. At {{the top of the}} hillside is the quarter of Weißer Hirsch, named after a former inn erected in 1685 by the Saxon kapellmeister Christoph Bernhard, where in 1888 the naturopathic physician Heinrich Lahmann opened a sanatorium. The quarters of Wachwitz and Pillnitz are adjacent in the east and the Rosengarten park in the west. Loschwitz is connected with the borough of Blasewitz south of the Elbe by the Blue Wonder (Blaues Wunder) bridge. Furthermore, the borough encompasses large parts of the Dresden Heath, the city's forest.|$|E
50|$|The {{position}} of Surrentum was very secure, protected by deep gorges. The only exception to its natural protection was 300 m on the south-west {{where it was}} defended by walls, the line of which is necessarily followed by those of the modern town. The arrangement of the modern streets preserves that of the ancient town, and the dis{{position of}} the walled paths which divide the plain to the east seems to date in like manner from Roman times. No ruins are now preserved in the town itself, {{but there are many}} remains in the <b>villa</b> <b>quarter</b> to the east of the town on the road to Stabiae, of which traces still exist, running much higher than the modern road, across the mountain; the site of one of the largest (possibly belonging to the Imperial house) is now occupied by the Hotel Victoria, under the terrace of which a small theatre was found in 1855; an ancient rock-cut tunnel descends hence to the shore. Remains of other villas may be seen, but the most important ruin is the reservoir of the (subterranean) aqueducts just outside the town on the east, which had no less than twenty-seven chambers each about 270 by 60 cm. Greek and Oscan tombs have also been found.|$|E
40|$|The Kolin's <b>villas</b> <b>quarter</b> "Čechovy sady" {{was founded}} at the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century as a residential area of local social elite. The builduings owners were for example artists, teachers, entrepreuners or architects and builders. During the "First republic" it became place of representative and resting belt of greenery of near surroundings, just in sight of the city center. However, the turning points of history - the second world war and mainly the communist coup in February 1948 - totally changed political, social, economical, ideological and cultural course of events. These historical moments left its marks on the people of Čechovy sady, and also on the fate of the whole "place". Present bachelor thesis analyses by way of the example of <b>villas</b> <b>quarter</b> Čechovy sady the transformation of the conceptions of housing, way of life and architecture. It attempts to explain that the villas architecture in the Czechoslovakia of the second half of the twentieth century was the unsuitable type of building, therefore there was established the collectivist and mass concept of society, policy, and also housing and architecture. And the "Villa" as a symbol of individual and civic housing and architecture lost its spot and meaning. In the case of Čechovy sady it constituted the symbolical conlusion - [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Dresden's urban {{parts are}} {{subdivided}} in rather {{a lot of}} city quarters, up to around 100, among them relatively many larger <b>villa</b> <b>quarters</b> dominated by historic multiple dwelling units, especially, but not only along the river, most known are Blasewitz, Loschwitz, Pillnitz and Weißer Hirsch. Also some Art Nouveau living quarters and two bigger quarters typical for communist architecture - but much renovated - can be found. The villa town of Radebeul joins the Dresden city tram system, which is expansive {{due to the lack}} of an underground system.|$|R
40|$|Thinking of the <b>villa</b> <b>quarters</b> of Budapest, Andrássy Road, Svábhegy or the Rózsadomd are {{the ones}} that first come to mind of many. These are the most {{well-known}} rows of villas of the capital, but in the green zone of the 16 th district there is a less well-known but yet even more remarkable villa quarter: Mátyásföld. Mátyásföld was founded in 1887 in the outskirts of Cinkota, part of the eastern agglomeration of Budapest at the time. Every source has recorded the circumstances of its establishment as legendary. However, its founder was a good businessman rather than a character from a fairy tale. He recognised the change of lifestyles typical of the era, and sought business opportunities. It became fashionable at the time that anyone who could afford to do so, created a second, representative home in the green area outside the city, but still within the reach of the centre. In the outskirts of the city, more and more holiday homes and <b>villa</b> <b>quarters</b> were established, and Mátyásföld was created also for this purpose. The central issue of this dissertation is how Mátyásföld, founded in the agglomeration of the capital, was built and how it managed to fit into the urban development of Budapest, as well as the life of its inhabitants. Beyond its unique geographic and administrative situation, the role [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The {{trick is}} always buy when you're strong so {{he needs to}} buy players. You can't win {{anything}} with kids.

25|$|The building’s {{interior}} is distributed across three floors: a basement floor, {{which includes the}} kitchen, pantry and service areas; a ground floor including all the living rooms, dining rooms, atriums and library; and a first-floor which corresponds to the private quarters. Visitors entering the Villa through the main entrance from the street, that is relatively dark, will gain their first impression of the building’s structure and {{its relationship with the}} garden, from the impressive two-storey central hall. Looking in front, through the vast exterior window, they will see the central parterre and park. Looking to the right, they will see the vast salon which extends via the window to the lateral parterre. The <b>Villa’s</b> private <b>quarters</b> can be sensed rather than seen, via the first floor gallery around the central atrium. To the left, with a slight difference of floor levels, there is an elegant dining room that overlooks the garden and a billiards room, on the other side, that looks over the street. Beyond them we see a wrought iron gate designed by Edgar Brandt, which separates this social zone from the <b>Villa’s</b> private <b>quarters</b> on the first floor and also the library and service areas on the ground floor.|$|R
50|$|On the pitch, Portsmouth's late {{transfer}} of funds called for a flurry of transfers {{at the end of}} the window, including the loan signing of Ivorian international Aruna Dindane, who would go on to score a hat-trick against Wigan Athletic. An opening run of seven defeats raised fears Hart would be sacked, but at the eighth attempt, at Molineux, Hassan Yebda (another loanee) headed the first win. Portsmouth were beaten 4-2 at Fratton Park by Aston <b>Villa</b> in the <b>quarter</b> finals of the League Cup, having beaten off Premiership high-flyers Stoke City; yet another loanee, Frédéric Piquionne, was on target twice. However, because of the financial problems, the Premier League placed the club under a transfer embargo, meaning the club were not allowed to sign any players.|$|R
5|$|Villa {{were back}} among the elite as Saunders {{continued}} to mould a winning team. This {{culminated in a}} seventh top-flight league title in 1980–81. To the surprise of commentators and fans, Saunders quit halfway through the 1981–82 season, after falling out with the chairman, with <b>Villa</b> in the <b>quarter</b> final of the European Cup. He was replaced by his softly-spoken assistant manager Tony Barton who guided the club to a 1–0 victory over Bayern Munich in the European Cup final in Rotterdam courtesy of a Peter Withe goal. The following season Villa were crowned European Super Cup winners, beating Barcelona in the final. This marked a pinnacle though and Villa's fortunes declined sharply {{for most of the}} 1980s, culminating in relegation in 1987. This was followed by promotion the following year under Graham Taylor and a runners-up position in the First Division in the 1989–90 season.|$|R
50|$|The Contrée of Sierre was {{originally}} a group the managed the commons. As vassals of the Bishop, {{they had the}} right to assemble twice a year to regulate the management of the common lands and the affairs of the local police. In the 14th and 15th century this cooperative adopted a larger political role as they started to administer more of the daily affairs in the villages and acquired the right to appoint their own judges. Eventually this grew into the Noble Contrée which then formed the core of Sierre Zenden from which the city of Sierre later developed. The town of Plan-Sierre soon took over the leadership role in the Noble Contrée. Until 1798, the Noble Contrée was appointed by a council of village representatives, under the leadership of the Bishop's representative. In 1559, Plan-Sierre divided into four <b>quarters</b> <b>Villa,</b> Monderèche, La Salla and Glarey. In 1620, the town hall was built.|$|R
