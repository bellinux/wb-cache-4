40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>vandetanib,</b> an agent that targets RET, VEGFR and EGFR signaling, against EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells with PTEN loss was investigated. Two EGFR mutant {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) cell lines, PC- 9 (PTEN wild type) and NCI-H 1650 (PTEN null), were used. We transfected an intact FTEN gene into H 1650 cells and knocked down PTEN expression in PC- 9 cells using shRNA. The {{effectiveness of}} gefitinib and <b>vandetanib</b> {{was assessed using}} a xenograft model. While PC- 9 cells were more resistant to <b>vandetanib</b> than gefitinib, H 1650 cells were more sensitive to <b>vandetanib</b> than gefitinib. Both gefitinib and <b>vandetanib</b> suppressed the activation of EGFR and MAPK in H 1650 cells, although phosphorylated AKT levels were not affected.

Methods: We compared anti-HCC effects and toxicity in the six treatment groups: control (untreated), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) S- 1, metronomic S- 1, <b>vandetanib,</b> MTD S- 1 with <b>vandetanib,</b> and metronomic S- 1 with <b>vandetanib.</b> Tumor microvessel density (MVD) and tumor apoptosis were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The expression of VEGF and thrombospondin- 1, an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis, was analyzed by Western blot. Results: Metronomic S- 1 significantly inhibited tumor growth, which was enhanced by combination with <b>vandetanib.</b> With respect to toxicities, MTD S- 1 caused severe body weight loss and myelosuppression, whereas metronomic S- 1 did not cause any overt toxicities. Moreover, metronomic S- 1 or metronomic S- 1 with <b>vandetanib</b> prolonged survival, the latter treatment providing the greatest benefit. Metronomic S- 1 and metronomic S- 1 with <b>vandetanib</b> decreased MVDs and increased apoptosis in tumor tissues.

40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Vandetanib</b> [vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) receptor/epidermal growth factor receptor/RET inhibitor] has shown {{improvements}} in progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced {{non-small cell lung cancer}} in three randomized phase II studies: <b>vandetanib</b> versus gefitinib (study 3), docetaxel +/- <b>vandetanib</b> (study 6), and carboplatin-paclitaxel and/or <b>vandetanib</b> (study 7). In study 7, <b>vandetanib</b> monotherapy was inferior to carboplatin-paclitaxel. We performed an exploratory retrospective {{analysis of the}} relationship between baseline circulating VEGF concentrations and PFS. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Mean baseline VEGF levels were determined by ELISA from two baseline samples of plasma (163 of 168 patients, study 3; 65 of 127, study 6) or serum (144 of 181, study 7). High baseline VEGF values were above the immunoassay reference range for healthy subjects; low baseline VEGF values were within the range. RESULTS: Patients with low baseline VEGF had a lower risk of disease progression with <b>vandetanib</b> versus gefitinib [hazard ratio (HR), 0. 55; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 0. 35 - 0. 86; P = 0. 01] or <b>vandetanib</b> 100 mg/d + docetaxel versus docetaxel (HR, 0. 25; 95 % CI, 0. 09 - 0. 68; P = 0. 01). High VEGF patients had a similar risk of disease progression with <b>vandetanib</b> monotherapy versus gefitinib (HR, 1. 03; 95 % CI, 0. 60 - 1. 75; P = 0. 92) or <b>vandetanib</b> 100 mg/d + docetaxel versus docetaxel (HR, 0. 95; 95 % CI, 0. 25 - 3. 61; P = 0. 94). In study 7, low VEGF patients had a similar risk of disease progression with <b>vandetanib</b> monotherapy 300 mg/d versus carboplatin-paclitaxel (HR, 0. 80; 95 % CI, 0. 41 - 1. 56; P = 0. 51); high VEGF patients progressed more quickly (HR, 1. 60; 95 % CI, 0. 81 - 3. 15; P = 0. 17). CONCLUSIONS: These analyses suggest that low baseline circulating VEGF may be predictive of PFS advantage in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving <b>vandetanib</b> versus gefitinib or <b>vandetanib</b> + docetaxel versus docetaxel. Moreover, patients with low VEGF levels may have a similar outcome with either <b>vandetanib</b> monotherapy or carboplatin-paclitaxel...|$|E

Nude mice bearing A 2780 - 1 A 9 xenografts received daily (5, 10, or 15 days) doses of <b>vandetanib</b> (50 mg/kg per os), combined with PTX (20 mg/kg intravenously). Morphologic and functional modifications associated with the tumor vasculature (CD 31 and alpha-smooth muscle actin staining and Hoechst 33342 perfusion) and PTX concentrations in plasma and tumor tissues were analyzed. Activity was evaluated as inhibition of tumor growth subcutaneously and spreading into the peritoneal cavity. <b>Vandetanib</b> treatment produced no significant change in tumor vessel density, although a reduced number of large vessels, an increased percentage of mature vessels, and diminished tumor perfusion were evident. Pretreatment with <b>vandetanib</b> led to decreased tumor PTX levels within 1 hour of PTX injection, although 24 hours later, tumor PTX levels were comparable with controls.

40|$|Introduction:After early {{reports of}} vandetanib’s {{efficacy}} in the induction setting, we evaluated {{the effect of}} combination docetaxel, carboplatin, and <b>vandetanib,</b> followed by maintenance therapy with either <b>vandetanib,</b> or placebo on progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced non–small-cell lung cancer. Methods:Patients with advanced non–small-cell lung cancer were randomized to induction docetaxel (75 [*]mg/m 2) + carboplatin (area under the curve of 6) on day 1 of a 21 -day cycle, and daily <b>vandetanib</b> (100 [*]mg/day orally) for four cycles, followed by daily <b>vandetanib</b> (300 [*]mg/day orally) or placebo until progression. Eligible patients had measurable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 of 1, and no prior cytotoxic or targeted agents for advanced disease. Results:One hundred sixty-two patients were randomized; 158 began induction treatment. Fifty-eight patients began maintenance <b>vandetanib</b> or placebo (median, 3. 5 cycles). Median PFS for patients randomized to maintenance <b>vandetanib</b> was 4. 5 months (95 % confidence interval, 3. 3 – 5. 8 months), and for patients randomized to maintenance placebo was 4. 2 months (95 % confidence interval, 2. 8 – 4. 9 months). An exploratory analysis showed prolonged PFS for patients randomized to <b>vandetanib</b> maintenance (stratified log-rank p= 0. 07) as also in a multivariate model adjusting for sex and stage (p= 0. 02). Differences in PFS were not observed among patients who began maintenance therapy. Toxicities were similar to other studies of these agents.

Tumor oxygenation, perfusion, cellular consumption of oxygen, and radiation sensitivity were studied in transplantable liver tumors after daily doses of <b>vandetanib</b> (25 mg kg(- 1) i. p.). Measurements of oxygenation (pO(2)) and tumor cell oxygen consumption were carried out using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and perfusion parameters were assessed by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Regrowth delay assays were performed after treatment with <b>vandetanib</b> alone, radiation alone {{or a combination of}} both treatments. <b>Vandetanib</b> induced an early increase in tumor oxygenation that did not correlate with remodeling of the tumor vasculature or with changes in tumor perfusion.
