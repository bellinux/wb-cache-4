40|$|To {{clarify the}} role of IP- 10 in {{autoimmune}} liver diseases, we studied the serum levels of IP- 10 in 14 patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), 23 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and 65 patients with chronic <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (20 <b>type</b> <b>B</b> and 45 <b>type</b> C). The hepatic expression of IP- 10 mRNA and {{the correlation between the}} serum levels of IP- 10 and clinical parameters were also evaluated. In addition to 20 healthy controls, 16 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients were included as an extrahepatic inflammatory disease. The serum level of IP- 10 was significantly (P < 0 · 02) higher in patients with AIH, PBC, and chronic hepatitis B and C than in healthy controls, and it was significantly correlated (P < 0 · 05) with the serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in patients with AIH, PBC, and chronic hepatitis B and C. The serum level of IP- 10 was not elevated in RA patients. After successful treatment of AIH and chronic hepatitis C, the serum level of IP- 10 decreased to the same level as in healthy volunteers. As we previously showed in cases with chronic hepatitis B or C, in situ hybridization in both AIH and PBC cases demonstrated the expression of IP- 10 mRNA in hepatocytes around focal or lobular necrosis surrounded by infiltrating mononuclear cells, whereas IP- 10 mRNA was not expressed in areas around the damaged bile ducts in PBC cases. The present results suggest that IP- 10 is specifically produced by hepatocytes in inflammatory areas irrespective of the aetiology of hepatitis, and that IP- 10 may help to recruit T cells to the hepatic lesions in autoimmune liver diseases as well as in chronic <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis...</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) -specific cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) response during acute and chronic viral hepatitis, target cells that express HBV-encoded antigens {{in the context}} of the appropriate HLA restriction element must be available for each subject studied. Since HBV is not infectious for human cells in vitro, such target cells must be produced by DNA-mediated gene transfer into cultured human primary cells or cell lines. For this purpose, we have developed a panel of Epstein-Barr virus-based episomal expression vectors containing each of the HBV open reading frames under the transcriptional control of the simian virus 40 early promoter. Transfection of Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B-cell lines with this panel of recombinants consistently leads to stable expression of the HBV envelope, nucleocapsid, and polymerase proteins. The HBV X gene product is transiently expressed following transfection, but stable expression of this protein cannot be maintained on a long-term basis. To assess the suitability of this system for the identification of HBV-specific CTL in humans, a panel of EBO-HBV transfectants of defined HLA haplotype was used to monitor the HBV-specific CTL response in a patient with acute <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> <b>B.</b> Transfectants that stably express the HBV nucleocapsid (core) antigen were found to serve as excellent targets for the detection of HLA class I-restricted CTL that recognize endogenously synthesized HBV core antigen in this patient; they were also successfully used to stimulate the specific expansion of these CTL in vitro...|$|E

In my beachelor thesis was covered years from 2000 to 2004. Now I continue with this diploma thesis where I want the 10 year results join together {{to show how the}} situation is developing. The intravenous drug users are the aimed group. These drug users belong to a high-risk group in which <b>hepatitises</b> <b>types</b> A, <b>B</b> or C are spread the most thanks to their high-risk behaviour. These days researches and epidemiologic researches show that the intravenous drug users belong among the main high-risk groups endangered by infectious disease. <b>Viral</b> <b>hepatitises</b> represent a serious problem, mainly <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> C, because {{there is no way of}} protection. This hepatitis is occuring without any symptoms of this disease by 50 ? 70 % people. By 70 ? 80 % it passes into a chronic stadium. It is possible to protect yourself by <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> A vaccination. This hepatitis doesn´t change into a chronic stadium. It is easily spread by infected water or food. In our republic there occured several epidemics. Hepatitises started to spread among drug users and then they spread also among the rest of population. The last epidemic occured in 2008. <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> <b>B</b> represents high risks for the perceptive population. There is a vaccine and population have a chance to protect against it. In the Czech Republic there is vaccination carried out within special vaccination of people who have high-risk job, for example in health service. Children of HBsAg positive mothers are vaccinated after they are born. From 2001 hepatitis vaccination was put into regular vaccination of children aged under 1 year in our republic. Also 12 year old children are vaccinated from 2001. <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> <b>B</b> often becomes chronic and the mortality is 1 ? 2 %. Intravenous using of drug is important high-risk factor. It is one of the ways of transfering <b>hepatitises</b> <b>type</b> <b>B</b> and C. Next monitored indicators are the age of the clients, achieved level of education, basic drug, the age of the first usage of any drug, the age of intravenous application of drug and occurrence of <b>hepatitises</b> <b>type</b> A, <b>B,</b> C by clients. According to my research I used quantitative research which allows me to analyse problem of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitises</b> by clients from Psychiatric Hospital in Červený Dvůr. The gained information was worked out by secondary analysis of medical data. The monitored group has 2499 clients in years 2000 ? 2009. The aim of this thesis is to get general knowledge about prevalence of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitises</b> by clients of Psychiatric Hospital in Červený Dvůr from 2000 to 2009 and to consider their progress. The methodical procedure: there will be used a content analysis of medical data given by Psychiatric Hospital in Červený Dvůr. The result of this thesis is that it indicates and covered the develop of drug scene. Concerning the age the main group consists of 20 ? 24 year old men and women, next large group consists of clients aged 25 ? 29.

40|$|Acute <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> <b>B</b> was {{observed}} in three patients convalescing from hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) -negative viral hepatitis. The two types of viral hepatitis were clearly differentiated by serial HBs Ag determinations with coun-terimmunoelectrophoresis and radioimmunoassay. These findings provide additional evidence {{of the lack of}} cross-immunity between the two types of viral hepatitis and indicate that patients with HBs Ag-positive and HBs Ag-negative acute ' viral hepatitis should be separated. Relapsing viral hepatitis is a well-known clinical entity characterized by a recurrence of the origi-nal symptoms on one or more occasions in a pa-tient who has apparently recovered completely from a recent episode of acute viral hepatitis [1]. Relapsing viral hepatitis must be differentiated from a second infection with a different agent, since there is considerable evidence that various etiologic entities cause hepatitis. It is generally assumed that a short interval between two episodes of jaundice more likely indicates a re-lapse than a new infection [1, 2]. This distinction, however, remained uncertain as long as reliable criteria for the different types of viral hepatitis were lacking. The concept of at least two types of viral hepatitis [2], type A and type B, has been de-rived mainly from experiments with volunteers that have clearly demonstrated the lack of sufficient antigenic similarity between two strains of hepatitis virus to provide cross-protection on challenge [3 - 7].

40|$|Abstract Background Survivin, one of {{the strongest}} {{apoptosis}} inhibitors, plays a critical role in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). By comparison, relatively {{little is known about the}} effect of survivin gene polymorphisms on HCC susceptibility. Our study aimed to investigate the association of survivin gene polymorphisms with the risk of HCC in Chinese han population. Methods A case-control study was conducted in Chinese han population consisting of 178 HCC cases and 196 cancer-free controls. Information on demographic data and related risk factors was collected for all subjects. Polymorphisms of the survivin gene, including three loci of rs 8073069, rs 9904341 and rs 1042489, were selected and genotyped by a polymerase chain reaction- restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. Association analysis of genotypes/alleles and haplotypes from these loci with the risk of HCC was conducted under different genetic models. Results Using univariate analysis of rs 8073069, rs 9904341 and rs 1042489 under different genetic models, no statistically significant difference was found in genotype or allele distribution of HCC cases relative to the controls (P > 0. 05). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed that these loci were in LD. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that with no G-C-T haplotype as reference, the haplotype of G-C-T from these loci was associated with a lower risk for HCC under the recessive model (OR = 0. 46, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 24 ~ 0. 90, P = 0. 023). Both HBsAg+ and the medical history of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> <b>B</b> were risk factors for HCC. However, no statistically significant haplotype-environment interaction existed. Conclusions No association between rs 8073069, rs 9904341 or rs 1042489 in survivin gene and the risk of HCC is found in Chinese han population, but rs 8073069 G-rs 9904341 C- rs 1042489 T is perhaps a protective haplotype for HCC. </p...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS A 51 -year-old {{patient with}} {{haemophilia}} since childhood (usual factor VIII level 14 %) developed acute <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> <b>B</b> {{two months after}} an operation which had been covered by cryoprecipitate. The course of the hepatitis following admission was severe with encephalopathy and ascites. Evidence of intravascular coagulation with an increased radioactive fibrinogen turnover was also present. The factor VIII level measured by a one-stage clotting factor assay rose rapidly to 200 % of normal and remained at this level for two weeks, and factor-VIII-related antigen as measured by electroimmunoassay also became greatly elevated (900 % of normal). The possible mechanisms underlying those surprising changes are discussed. The syndrome of fulminant hepatic failure, caused by viral hepatitis or toxic liver damage, is characteristi-cally accompanied by a severe coagulation disturb-ance. Bleeding, which was the direct {{cause of death in}} 35 % of the patients in a recent series (Clark et al, 1973), is caused in part by the failure of the liver to synthesize clotting factors, aggravated by consump-tion of these factors in the process of intravascular coagulation (Rake et al, 1970). Levels of many clotting factors are low with the exception of factor VIII, which may become elevated for reasons not currently known (Meili and Straub, 1970). The finding that the same elevation of factor VIII could occur in a haemophiliac patient with acute hepatitis was rather unexpected, and in this paper we describe the changes found in the serial coagulation tests {{during the course of the}} illness. Clinical History The patient, a 51 -year-old musician, was found to have haemophilia in childhood. All through his life he had suffered from excessive bleeding from wounds and following dental extractions. There was no family history of the disorder. Two months before the admission with hepatitis, the patient had bee...|$|E

Isopycnic banding in cesium chloride, rate-zonal separation in sucrose, and preparative zonal electrophoresis were used in various combinations for successive purification, and the purified antigen was successfully used in a test for antibody by IAHA. Seronconversions to HA Ag were demonstrated by IAHA in 20 instances of hepatitis A virus infection, but in none of six cases of <b>type</b> <b>B</b> <b>hepatitis</b> or three cases of post-transfusion hepatitis unrelated to heaptitis A or B viruses, nor in two individuals without hepatitis. In addition, the temporal pattern of antibody development during <b>type</b> A <b>hepatitis</b> was studied in serial sera from an experimentally infected chimpanzee.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{identify}} the etiologies and associated complications of liver cirrhosis for new cases emerging {{over the past}} decade in the region served by the Second Affiliated Clinical College of Chongqing University of Medical Sciences. MethodsThe institute′s inpatient medical record database was searched for all individuals admitted with a new diagnosis of liver cirrhosis between January 2002 and December 2011. Data on demographics and clinical findings were collected for retrospective analysis to determine the regional and temporal profiles of etiologies and complications. The count data, expressed as percent of total, was analyzed by the Chi-squared test. ResultsAmong the total 2002 liver cirrhosis cases, the most frequent etiologies (＞ 1. 5 % of total) were <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> <b>B</b> (60. 6 %), fatty liver caused by both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and alcohol (16. 6 %), alcoholic fatty liver (6. 6 %), autoimmune liver disease (3. 4 %), autoimmune liver disease and alcohol (3. 2 %), and nonalcoholic fatty liver (1. 7 %). From {{the first half of the}} decade to the second half (January 2002 -December 2006 vs. January 2007 -December 2011), the incidences of two etiologies significantly increased (HBV and alcohol: 13. 6 % vs. 17. 7 %, P＜ 0. 05 and autoimmune liver disease: 3. 5 % vs. 7. 1 %, P＜ 0. 05) and the incidence of HBV significantly decreased (64  1 % vs. 59. 3 %, P＜ 0. 05). The most common major complications of cirrhosis were primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; 22  1 %), spontaneous peritonitis (21. 3 %), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (19  3 %), hepatic encephalopathy (7. 3 %), and hepatorenal syndrome (4. 0 %). The incidence of liver cancer was significantly higher in patients with a family history of hepatitis B (31. 1 % vs. 22  2 %, P＜ 0. 05) and positively correlated with HBV DNA load (χ 2 = 10. 88, P＜ 0. 05). ConclusionIn Chongqing, HBV remains a major cause of cirrhosis, even though alcoholism and autoimmune disease are rising in importance as etiological factors, and HCC is still the major complication of liver cirrhosis. The public health strategies in this region should continue to target prevention of HBV infection and diagnosis/treatment of HCC in early stages...|$|E
40|$|To analyze interleukin- 2 -dependent immunoregulatory {{function}} in hepatitis B virus infection {{and in other}} forms of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> levels of soluble interleukin- 2 receptors (sIL- 2 R) were measured by an enzyme-linked assay in sera from patients with acute and chronic <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> of different etiology. Increased sIL- 2 R levels were detected in the early phase of acute <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> A and <b>type</b> <b>B,</b> but not during acute non-A, non-B hepatitis. Among 46 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, levels of sIL- 2 R were significantly increased only in cases with chronic active hepatitis, while they were about normal in chronic persistent hepatitis or in healthy carriers of the infection. These differences were independent of virus replication, being maintained when patients were stratified according to HBeAg/anti-HBe status and to serum HBV-DNA. Nine patients with chronic active <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> <b>B</b> and high sIL- 2 R levels at presentation were followed prospectively for two to eight years, and in HBeAg-positive patients, the behavior of receptor levels closely paralleled disease activity. These results, which may reflect increased shedding of IL- 2 R by activated T lymphocytes in patients with active destruction of HBV infected hepatocytes, indicate the usefulness and potential prognostic importance of serum sIL- 2 R determination in patients with chronic <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> Patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis had much lower sIL- 2 R levels, although their liver disease was similar to hepatitis B cases, suggesting that different pathogenetic mechanisms operate in these patients...|$|R
40|$|Liver biopsies from 86 {{patients}} with serologically established acute hepatitis A were evaluated for {{quantitative and qualitative}} light microscopic features together with biopsies from 78 {{patients with}} acute <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> <b>B</b> and 76 patients with acute <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> non-A, non-B. <b>Hepatitis</b> A was characterised by more pronounced portal inflammation than hepatitis non-A, non-B (p less than 0. 01) but less conspicuous parenchymal changes (focal necrosis, Kupffer cell proliferation, acidophil bodies, ballooning) than found in <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type</b> <b>B</b> (p less than 0. 01). Steatosis occurred in 10 % of the hepatitis A biopsies compared with 26 % (p less 0. 01) and 6 % (not significant) in the hepatitis non-A, non-B and B groups, respectively. A comparison between the histological findings in women and men revealed that iron deposits occurred {{in more than half}} of the men compared to less than 20 % of the women (p less than 0. 01) irrespective of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>type.</b> Histological and biochemical follow-up was available in 36 patients with hepatitis A. For the majority of these patients the bilirubin concentration reached normal values within one month of the initial biopsy. The activity of serum transaminases showed good correlation with the degree of histological resolution. Non-specific reactive hepatitis with slightly raised serum transaminases were often seen during recovery from hepatitis A. These patients may be misinterpreted as cases of acute non-A, non-B hepatitis...|$|R
