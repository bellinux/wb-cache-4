40|$|Background: Atrophic {{vaginitis}} is a disease, {{which affects}} up to 50 % of postmenopausal women. This study compared the effectiveness and user-friendliness of Vagifem (an estradiol vaginal tablet) and <b>vaginal</b> estrogen <b>cream</b> {{in the treatment}} of atrophic vaginitis. Materials and Methods: One hundred and sixty postmenopausal women with symptoms of atrophic vaginitis were randomly divided into two groups of treatment with Vagifem or with <b>vaginal</b> estrogen <b>cream</b> for 12 weeks. Patients used the medication daily for the first 2 weeks of the study, and twice weekly. Severity of vaginal atrophy and four main symptoms of atrophic vaginitis including dysuria, dyspareunia, vaginal itching, and dryness were evaluated and compared before and after treatment. In addition, patients were asked regarding user-friendliness and hygienic issues of medications. Results: Both <b>vaginal</b> estrogen <b>cream</b> and Vagifem significantly improved symptoms of atrophic vaginitis but in terms of effectiveness for the treatment symptoms of atrophic vaginitis, {{there was no significant difference}} between the two medications.

50|$|A {{hemihydrate}} form of estradiol, estradiol hemihydrate, {{is widely}} used medically under {{a large number of}} brand names similarly to estradiol. In terms of activity and bioequivalence, estradiol and its hemihydrate are identical, with the only disparities being an approximate 1% difference in potency by weight (due to the presence of water molecules in the hemihydrate form of the substance) and a slower rate of release with certain formulations of the hemihydrate. This is because estradiol hemihydrate is more hydrated than anhydrous estradiol, and for this reason, is more insoluble in water in comparison, which results in slower absorption rates with specific formulations of the drug such as vaginal tablets. Estradiol hemihydrate has also been shown to result in less systemic absorption as a vaginal tablet formulation relative to other topical estradiol formulations such as <b>vaginal</b> <b>creams.</b>|$|R

25|$|Hormones can be {{administered}} {{in a variety}} of ways, including percutaneous skin and <b>vaginal</b> <b>creams,</b> oral pills, topical gels, vaginal rings and tablets, and transdermal patches. Though all preparations of a given type of estrogen (e.g. estradiol) may be molecularly identical before their introduction into the human body, estrogens administered orally are modified by the liver before entering the bloodstream and in this process, most is converted to estrone. However, estrogen bypassing the digestive tract and liver and entering through the skin is not converted to a new form before entering the bloodstream. Creams and gels applied to the skin also enter the blood directly and without modification but absorption of the gels, creams, and patches can vary from application to application, depending on the temperature and condition of the skin. Pharmaceutical compounding is frequently used to modify the dose, form, and additives of the preparations, based on instructions from a health-care practitioner.|$|R
