25|$|Cabernet Franc {{can adapt}} {{to a wide variety}} of <b>vineyard</b> <b>soil</b> types but seems to thrive in sandy, chalk soils, {{producing}} heavier, more full bodied wines there. In the Loire Valley, terroir based differences can be perceived between wines made from grapes grown in gravel terraces versus tuffeau slopes. The grape is highly yield sensitive, with over-cropping producing wines with more green, vegetal notes.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} a wine region will largely dictate whether Chenin blanc is {{produced}} in a predominately sweet or dry manner, while the <b>vineyard</b> <b>soil</b> type will generally influence the overall style of the wine. Heavy clay based soils, paired with the right climate, is favorable {{to the development of}} weighty, botrytized dessert wines that need time to age and mature. Well-drained and less organic, predominately sandy soils tend to produce lighter styles of wine that mature more quickly. Chenin blanc planted in soils with a high silex content will produce wines with distinctive minerally notes, while limestone based soils will encourage wines with sharp acidity. In Vouvray the soil is predominately argilo-calcaire or calcareous clay, which produces rounded wines with both acidity and weight. In areas where schist is plentiful in the soil, Chenin blanc grapes will generally ripen earlier than in vineyards with predominately clay based soils.|$|E
25|$|Nebbiolo {{does not}} adapt {{particularly}} well to various <b>vineyard</b> <b>soil</b> types, preferring soils with {{high concentration of}} calcareous marl such as those found on the right bank of the Tanaro river around Alba where Barolo and Barbaresco are produced. The grape can thrive in sandy soils, such as those on the left bank of the Tanaro around the Roero district but the wines from this soil type tend not to be as perfumed - lacking in particular the classic tar aromas. The slightly acidic pH of the sandy Roero soils tend to produce early maturing wines. The lighter wines of Ghemme and Gattinara come from the acidic porphyry soils of the hills between Novara and Vercelli. In the lower Aosta Valley, the soil has {{a high concentration of}} granite while the soils of the Valtellina region of Lombardy are predominantly schist based. In addition to soil type, the drainage ability and concentration of magnesium and potassium can have an influencing effect on the type of Nebbiolo wine is produced.|$|E

40|$|The use of copper-based {{fungicides}} {{leads to}} an accumulation of copper (Cu) in <b>vineyard</b> <b>soils,</b> potentially causing adverse effects to the microbial function and fertility of the soil. This study used a soil microcosm approach to assess the effects of Cu accumulation on microbial function in <b>vineyard</b> <b>soils.</b> Surface soil samples were collected from 10 vineyards {{and a number of}} un-impacted reference sites in each of three different viticultural regions of Australia. The field-collected soils were transferred to microcosms and maintained for up to 93 days in the laboratory at 20 - 22 °C and 60 % of their maximum water-holding capacity. The microbial function of the soils was indicated by measuring phosphomonoesterase, arylsulfatase, urease, and phenol oxidase activities. In general, the <b>vineyard</b> <b>soils</b> had greater concentrations of Cu and lower enzyme activities than in the reference soils, although a weak negative relationship between Cu and enzyme activity could only be found for phosphomonoesterase activity. The results show that soil physical-chemical properties (i. e., organic carbon, pH) are greater determinants of soil enzyme activity than increased soil Cu concentration at the Cu concentrations present in <b>vineyard</b> <b>soils...</b>|$|R
25|$|The Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine sub-appellation is {{the most}} {{productive}} and notable region of Muscadet, producing {{more than three-quarters of}} the region's entire production. (In contrast, the Muscadet-Coteaux de la Loire AOC only produces around 20% of the amount of wine of Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine) In fact, more AOC Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine is produced on a yearly basis than in any other single AOC in the entire Loire Valley. The appellation is located east and south around the city of Nantes and is named after the rivers Sèvre and Maine that flow through it. <b>Vineyard</b> <b>soil</b> composition varies throughout the region and can range from the granite and schist hillsides around the village of Saint-Fiacre-sur-Maine to the predominantly clay based soils of Vallet. The most ideally situated vineyards are located around the villages of La Chapelle-Heulin, St-Fiacre, Vallet and Vertou Around 45% of the wine made Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine is aged sur lie. The wines made in this style tend to be slightly fuller body and can have some of the texture and mouthfeel of a white Bourgogne AOC. Well made examples will have a balance of fruit, acidity and texture.|$|E
25|$|Grenache prefers hot, dry soils {{that are}} well drained but it {{relatively}} adaptable to all <b>vineyard</b> <b>soil</b> types. In southern France, Grenache thrives on schist and granite soils and has responded well to the stony soil of Châteauneuf-du-Pape with the area's galets roulés heat retaining stones. In Priorat, the crumbly schist soil of the region retain enough water to allow producers to avoid irrigation in the dry wine region. Vineyards with an overabundance of irrigation tend to produce pale colored wines with diluted flavors and excessive alcohol. The skin of Grenache is thin and lightly pigmented, making wines with pale color and low tannins. Older vines with low yields can increase the concentration of phenolic compounds and produced darker, more tannic wines such as {{those found in the}} Priorat region of Spain where yields are often around 5-6 hectoliters/hectare (less than half a ton per acre). Yield control is intimately connected with the resulting quality of wine with yields below 35 hl/ha (2 tons/acre), such as those practiced by many Châteauneuf-du-Pape estates, producing very different wines than those with yields closer to 50 hl/ha (5 tons/acre) which is the base yield for Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) wines labeled under the Côtes du Rhône designation. The strong wood canopy of Grenache makes the vine difficult to harvest with mechanical harvesters and pruning equipment and more labor-intensive to cultivate. In highly mechanized wine regions, such as Australia and California, this has contributed to a decline in the vine's popularity.|$|E
500|$|The Cabernet grape variety has thriven in {{a variety}} of <b>vineyard</b> <b>soil</b> types, making the {{consideration}} of soil less of concern particularly for New World winemakers. In Bordeaux, the soil aspect of terroir was historically an important consideration in determining which of the major Bordeaux grape varieties were planted. While Merlot seemed to thrive in clay- and limestone-based soils (such as those of the Right Bank regions of the Gironde estuary), Cabernet Sauvignon seemed to perform better in the gravel-based soil of the Médoc region on the Left Bank. The gravel soils offered the benefit of being well drained while absorbing and radiating heat to the vines, aiding ripening. Clay- and limestone-based soils are often cooler, allowing less heat to reach the vines, delaying ripening. In regions where the climate is warmer, there is more emphasis on soil that is less fertile, which promotes less vigor in the vine which can keep yields low. In the Napa Valley wine regions of Oakville and Rutherford, the soil is more alluvial and dusty. Rutherford Cabernet Sauvignon has been often quoted as giving a sense of terroir with a taste of [...] "Rutherford dust". In the South Australian wine region of Coonawarra, Cabernet Sauvignon has produced vastly different results from grape vines planted in the region's terra rosa soil– {{so much so that the}} red soil is considered the [...] "boundary" [...] of the wine region, with some controversy from wine growers with Cabernet Sauvignon planted on red soil.|$|E

2500|$|Mosel {{is one of}} 13 German wine regions (Weinbaugebiete) {{for quality}} wines (Qualitätswein, {{formerly}} QbA and Prädikatswein), and {{takes its name from}} the Mosel River (. Luxembourgish: Musel.). Before 1 August 2007 the region was called Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, but changed to a name that was considered more consumer-friendly. The wine region is Germany's third largest in terms of production but some consider it the leading region in terms of international prestige. The region covers the valleys of the rivers Mosel, Saar, and Ruwer from near the mouth of the Mosel at Koblenz and upstream to the vicinity of Trier in the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The area is known for the steep slopes of the region's vineyards overlooking the river. At 65° degrees incline, the steepest recorded vineyard in the world is the Calmont vineyard located on the Mosel and belonging to the village of Bremm, and therefore referred to as Bremmer Calmont. The Mosel is mainly famous for its wines made from the Riesling grape, but Elbling and Müller-Thurgau also contribute to the production, among others. In the past two decades red wine production, especially from the Spätburgunder (Pinot noir), has increased in the Mosel and throughout the German vignoble and has become of increasing interest to the international wine community. Because of the northerly location of the Mosel, the Riesling wines are often light, tending to lower alcohol, crisp and high in acidity, and often exhibit [...] "flowery" [...] rather than or in addition to [...] "fruity" [...] aromas. Its most common <b>vineyard</b> <b>soil</b> is derived in the main from various kinds of slate deposits, which tend to give the wines a transparent, mineralic aspect, that often exhibit great depth of flavor. In the current era of climate change much work has been done to improve and gain acceptance for completely dry ("Trocken") Rieslings in this region, so that most of the more famous makers have found acceptance for such wines, particularlly in Europe.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Indigenous {{plants have}} been grown {{naturally}} and vigorously in copper contaminated soils. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the phytoremediation ability of two indigenous plants naturally grown in two <b>vineyard</b> <b>soils</b> copper contaminated, and in a copper mining waste. However, it was evaluated the macro and micronutrient uptake and the potential of phytoremediation. So, a greenhouse study was carried out with Bidens pilosa and Plantago lanceolata in samples of <b>vineyard</b> <b>soils</b> (Inceptisol and Mollisol) copper contaminated, and in a copper mining waste. Plant growth, macro and micronutrient up take, tolerance index (TI), translocation factor (TF), metal extraction ratio (MER), bioaccumulation factor (BCF), plant effective number of the shoots (PENs), and plant effective number of the total plant (PENt) were analyzed. Both plants grown in <b>vineyard</b> <b>soils</b> showed high phytomass production and TI. P. lanceolata plants cultivated in the Inceptisol showed the highest copper concentrations in the shoots (142 mg kg– 1), roots (964 mg kg– 1) and entire plants (1, 106 mg kg– 1). High levels of copper were phytoaccumulated from the Inceptisol by B. pilosa and P. lanceolata with 3, 500 and 2, 200 g ha– 1 respectively.

Vojvodinian <b>vineyard</b> <b>soils</b> are generally not contaminated with heavy metals, with the exception of copper due to long-term intensive application of copper-based fungicide. In soil of 44 small vineyards, local contamination with Cr and Zn was found on one locality each, and geochemical origin Ni content higher than MAC in 9 samples from Fruška gora. Based on the second part of this study, content of all heavy metals, excluding Cu, was below MAC. However, in comparison to control sample, the content of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Ni and Pb was higher in <b>vineyard</b> <b>soils</b> at due to antropogenic influence and application of agro-chemicals. The highest concentration of Cu 336 mg kg- 1 was noted in Petrovaradin in surface layer of soil, which is three times the value of MAC (100 mg kg- 1).
