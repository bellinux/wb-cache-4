In Ianthopappus corymbosus, the underground system consists of rhizophore from which adventitious roots branch off. The subapical meristem of the adventitious root revealed that the ground meristem forms the inner layer which in a meristematic phase, forms 2 / 3 of the cortex.

In this study, cold storage contributes to reducing endogenous ABA content, resulting in dormancy breaking of Gladiolus. The ABA inhibitor fluridone also promotes germination, suggesting that ABA is an important hormone that regulates corm dormancy. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of the Gladiolus ABI 5 homolog (GhABI 5), which is a basic leucine zipper motif transcriptional factor (TF). GhABI 5 is expressed in dormant vegetative organs (corm, cormel and stolon) {{as well as in}} reproductive organs (stamen), and it is up-regulated by ABA or drought. Complementation analysis reveals that GhABI 5 rescues the ABA insensitivity of abi 5 - 3 during seed germination and induces the expression of downstream ABA response genes in Arabidopsis thaliana (EM 1, EM 6 and RD 29 B).

However, the P 23 k loss-of-function analysis {{was limited to the}} leaf, which is a <b>vegetative</b> <b>organ.</b> Considering the involvement of P 23 k in secondary wall formation, a dramatically altered phenotype is expected in the stem of P 23 k gene-silenced barley, where marked secondary wall deposition occurs during the reproductive growth stage. To test this hypothesis, barley striped mosaic virus-based virus-induced gene silencing of P 23 k was performed. Abnormal tiller formation and arrested intercalary elongation were observed in P 23 k-silenced barley. From these results, we speculated that cell wall architecture was altered by P 23 k gene silencing. Consistent with this idea, we observed a marked decrease in the amount of cell wall polysaccharides stained with calcofluor and down-regulation of the cellulose synthase-like CslF 6 gene involved in (1, 3; 1, 4) -β-D-glucan synthesis. Taken together, these results suggest that P 23 k is possibly involved in determining secondary wall architecture and contributes to tiller formation and intercalary elongation in barley.

The fatty acid profile was specific to each <b>vegetative</b> <b>organ</b> and was strongly affected by the hydrocarbons level in the impacted sites. Leaf extracts of plants from uncontaminated soil produced palmitic acid (C 16), octadecanoic acid (C 18 : 0), unsaturated oleic acids (C 18 : 1 -C 18 : 3), and unsaturated eichosanoic (C 20 : 2 -C 20 : 3) acids with a noticeable absence of the unsaturated hexadecatrienoic acid (C 16 : 3); this finding demonstrates, for the first time, that C. laxus is a C 18 : 3 plant. In plants from the phytoremediation systems, the total fatty acid contents in the leaf and the corm were negatively affected by the hydrocarbons presence; however, the effect was positive in root. Interestingly, under contaminated conditions, unusual fatty acids such as odd numbered carbons (C 15, C 17, C 21, and C 23) and uncommon unsaturated chains (C 20 : 3 n 6 and C 20 : 4) were produced together with a remarkable quantity of C 22 : 2 and C 24 : 0 chains in the corm and the leaf.
