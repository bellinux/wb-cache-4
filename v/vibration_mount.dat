40|$|Abstract: A design {{optimization}} of a {{variable displacement compressor}} that minimizes its crankshaft vibra-tion is presented. A <b>vibration</b> <b>mount</b> installed between the flywheel and crankshaft is used as the optimizing element; the stiffness and damping values of the mount are selected so that the shaft vibration level is min-imized over the cruise speed range, while the maximum twist angle acceleration amplitude and transmitted torque are kept within acceptable limits for the entire operating speed range. An asymptotic analysis is used to obtain the nonlinear vibrational response. This analysis provides analytic expressions for the motion and forces {{in terms of the}} operating speed and other geometric, kinetic, and dynamic parameters. Consequently, the calculation of the objective and constraint functions is simple to do. A result of the analysis is that the optimal design is insensitive to changes in the magnitude and shape of the cylinder pressure excitation...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{coupling}} an engine to a support frame for mounting to a fuselage of an aircraft using a three point vibration isolating mounting {{system in which}} the load reactive forces at each mounting point are statically and dynamically determined. A first vibration isolating mount pivotably couples a first end of an elongated support beam to a stator portion of an engine with the pivoting action of the <b>vibration</b> <b>mount</b> being oriented such that it is pivotable about a line parallel to a center line of the engine. An aft end of the supporting frame is coupled to the engine through an additional pair of vibration isolating mounts with the mounts being oriented such that they are pivotable about a circumference of the engine. The aft mounts are symmetrically spaced to each side of the supporting frame by 45 degrees. The relative orientation between the front mount and the pair of rear mounts is such that only the rear mounts provide load reactive forces parallel to the engine center line, in support of the engine to the aircraft against thrust forces. The forward mount is oriented so as to provide only radial forces to the engine and some lifting forces to maintain the engine in position adjacent a fuselage. Since each mount is connected to provide specific forces to support the engine, forces required of each mount are statically and dynamically determinable...|$|E

Linear elastic <b>vibration</b> isolation <b>mounts</b> are traditionally applied within complex structures to combat noise and vibration. Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) is becoming an established and tested noise and vibration modeling methodology that is frequently used to model the flow of noise and vibration in complex structures. A SEA model of a linear elastic <b>vibration</b> isolation <b>mount</b> is developed here which enables SEA analysis of elastically isolated systems for the first time. A <b>vibration</b> isolation <b>mount</b> model has been absent from SEA models {{because of the lack of}} an SEA formulation.

40|$|A {{model of}} arch {{stability}} in a conical hopper section has been derived, {{based upon the}} approaches of Walters, Walker and Li. A simple flow rule has resulted from this analysis. The model {{has been applied to}} vibrationally activated conical hoppers. Two limiting conditions were considered: the push mode, in which the vibrated wall section compresses the bulk material at plastic yield; and the pull mode, in which the wall releases stress upon the contained material and, with in the limit, exerts no hoop stress over the vibrated section of the hopper wall. The pull mode is assumed to induce a switch in stress orientation from a passive to an active stress state. Theoretically, this is very effective at causing flow within the contained materials. The model has been applied to a number of scenarios involving typical bulk materials, and the following conclusions have been deduced: (1) Vibration can be very effective at inducing flow in hopper systems and can generate flows at shallower wall-slope angles and much smaller outlet diameters than conventional analysis will permit. (2) The flow regime from a vibrationally induced system will probably be stick-slip. (3) The most effective strategy is to induce vibration over the complete height of the hopper. This will permit flow through very small outlets (theoretically down to zero diameter). However, there are mechanical problems associated with this approach. (4) When vibration is applied to a section of the cone, the location of the vibration source is acritical design parameter. The proposed model may provide the beginnings of a rational basis for design in this respect. (5) The ’one-third cone height’ <b>vibration</b> <b>mount</b> rule is not generally applicable...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Rubber {{has many}} useful {{applications}} in engineering, {{cause of his}} special properties. Nowadays many important products that meet high requirements are made of rubber, such as tires, seals, <b>vibration</b> <b>mounts,</b> bearings for bridges and for seismic isolation. The concept of seismic isolation provides a protection to structures against dynamic excitations. The increased cost in construction becomes very efficient during future earthquakes. In the field of seismic isolation rubber bearings {{were found to be}} very capable, because of the beneficial properties. The characteristic properties of rubber are: (1) it can undergo very high deformations, up to several 100 % in simple tension, (2) the typical stress [...] strain plots are highly nonlinear, (3) the material appears as (nearly) incompressible.

40|$|Ride comfort, driving {{stability}} and drivability are vital factors {{in terms of}} vehicle performance and the customer satisfaction. The power plant (IC engine) is the source for the vibration that reduces the vehicle performance and it need to be controlled to some extent such that the vehicle performance will be improved. The IC engine {{is made up of}} reciprocating and rotating parts and they produce unbalanced forces during their operation and produce the vibratory output at the vehicle supporting members. The vibration reduction will be possible by minimizing unbalanced forces and by providing the anti <b>vibration</b> <b>mounts</b> at the engine-vehicle interface.

50|$|Externally mounted {{monitoring}} {{technologies are}} also being investigated by the industry. Largely showing mixed results of success, these proposed technologies are mostly research based initiatives. A complexity arises out of detecting specific failing rollers using generalised monitoring technologies such as optic fibre cables or <b>vibration</b> monitoring transducers <b>mounted</b> to the conveyor frame. The general, non-specific nature of these technologies have many issues similar to those encountered with the traditional monitoring aids used by inspection personnel. Acoustic monitors, Infrared cameras and any other technology that does not monitor the rollers in a holistic way, generally fail to accurately predict impending roller failure.

40|$|Floor {{vibrations}} and {{acoustic excitation}} may limit {{the performance of}} precision equipment, that is used for example to produce computer chips or to make images of very tiny structures. Therefore, {{it is common to}} <b>mount</b> a <b>vibration</b> isolator in the suspension of such equipment to isolate it from these vibration sources. Most often, a vibration isolator with a low suspension stiffness is used to limit the transmission of floor vibrations onto the suspended equipment. However, a low suspension stiffness introduces problems with leveling of the equipment and it increases its susceptibility to acoustic excitation. The objective of this thesis is to develop an alternative solution based on an active hard <b>mount</b> <b>vibration</b> isolator, which provides a much stiffer suspension such that the problems mentioned before can be circumvented. An active control system, that consists of sensors, actuators and a controller, is used to keep a low transmission of floor vibrations. An additional advantage is that the damping of internal modes of the equipment can be increased, such that its accuracy is improved. Several feedback control strategies for the active hard <b>mount</b> <b>vibration</b> isolator are presented. In both models and experiments it is shown that the best control strategy is using a combination of acceleration and force sensors. Formulas for adjusting the control parameters to obtain the desired vibration isolation performance have been derived. Furthermore, a demonstration setup of a six-axes active hard <b>mount</b> <b>vibration</b> isolator is developed. Unfortunately, due to some hardware problems, the usable control bandwidth is limited and the noise level of the sensors is too high, which results in a vibration isolation performance that is less than desired. Despite these problems, the transmission of floor vibrations is reduced by a factor 18, while simultaneously the suspension stiffness is about 100 times higher as compared to a vibration isolator with a low suspension stiffness. In addition, the damping of the internal modes is increased significantly. Further research should focus on improving the mechanical design of the active hard <b>mount</b> <b>vibration</b> isolator, such that the control bandwidth can be increased, and on using sensors with ultra-low noise levels...|$|R
