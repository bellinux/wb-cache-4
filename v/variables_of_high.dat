40|$|Locus {{of control}} is a <b>variable</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> {{interest}} in the assessment and behavior of the elderly in long-term care (LTC) facilities. This study uses a situation-specific locus of control (LOC) index and controls for the influential variables in an LTC setting: age, education, sex, depression, and cognitive decline. Having an in-ternal LOC proved to influence various adjustment measures, in-cluding behavior rating, perception of environment, and psychiatric factors. The value and use of such a specialized LOC measure in LTC settings are stressed and discussed. Journal of Applied Gerontology, 1982, Vol. 1, 147 - 160 Adjustment in a long-term-care (LTC) facility such as a nursing home is a difficult task at best. In addition to the many developmental and situational changes required for an aged population, {{problems associated with the}} routinized, unstimulating, and often oppresive en-vironment of an LTC require much in adaptation (Hyer & Blazer, 1982). In such an environment any psychological construct or measurement tool that might facilitate quality of life, improve behavior, or better en-vironmental perceptions is one worthy of further study (Moos, 1974). Locus of control (LOC) is one <b>variable</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> interest in the assess-ment and study of the elderly in LTC settings. Unfortunately, previous research efforts using LOC measurements have yielded mixed results. Various investigators have found that an internal LOC in old age is related to greater life satisfaction (Palmore & Luikart, 1972); better ad-justment to aging (Wolk & Kurtz, 1975); and better coping and less defensiveness, greater cognitive complexity, differentiation, sensitivi-ty, and intellectual superiority (Kuypers, 1971).

The proposed fuzzy multi agent system consists of multiple fuzzy agents that benefit from fuzzy set theory to demonstrate their soft information (linguistic information). Fuzzy risk assessment is quantified by two linguistic <b>variables</b> <b>of</b> <b>high</b> and low. Through fuzzy computations, the multi agent system computes the fuzzy probabilities of breast cancer development based on various risk factors. By such ranking of high risk and low risk fuzzy probabilities, the multi agent system (MAS) decides whether {{the risk of breast}} cancer development is high or low. This information is then fed into an insurance premium adjuster in order to provide preventive decision making as well as to make appropriate adjustment of insurance premium and risk. This final step of insurance analysis also provides a numeric measure to demonstrate the utility of the approach. Furthermore, actual data are gathered from two hospitals in Mashhad during 1 year.

Participants were 20 high school students from a medium-sized city in Western Canada, all enrolled in a dropout prevention program. Data was collected via surveys on three separate occasions throughout the program. The results indicated a non-significant positive correlation between SES measures and academic self-efficacy. Delay discounting, defined as lack of willingness to wait for larger, but delayed rewards, had a non-significant negative correlation with both academic self-efficacy and two of three SES measures. Delay discounting was a significant moderator of the relationship between SES and academic self-efficacy. Lastly, the early school-leaving sample was found to have significantly higher levels of delay discounting than a college-based comparison sample. These findings suggest that the individual difference variable of delay discounting may help explain inconsistent relationships between socioeconomic background and likelihood of academic success.
