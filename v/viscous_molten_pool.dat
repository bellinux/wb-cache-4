Owing to {{a strong}} {{capability}} of penetration, the radiography {{can be used to}} observe and analyze the formation of a <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> inside weldments during laser deep penetration welding. The shape of a <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> and the thermal transmit of laser through keyhole can be real-time monitored and analyzed. During a high-power fiber laser bead on plate welding of type 304 stainless steel, a high-speed radiography camera was employed to capture the <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> images. These captured X-ray images were degraded by the disturbance and noises from the welding process and radiography devices.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present briefly two {{possible}} approaches for modelling the laser cladding process. The first approach is 2 D and consists {{in finding the}} shape of the <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> given the fraction of the laser power which is available at the surface of the workpiece and given the amount of powder sticking to the <b>molten</b> <b>pool.</b> The powder reaching the workpiece is assumed to melt instantaneously at the surface of the <b>molten</b> <b>pool,</b> it is then mixed into the <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> according to the computed velocity field. Because of its complexity, this model is solved only for two-dimensional situations and requires powerfull computers. On the other hand, accurate predictions of {{the shape of the}} <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> are obtained. The second approach is 3 D and takes into account the interations between the laser beam, the powder particles travelling into the carrier gas and the <b>molten</b> <b>pool.</b> The laser power reaching the surface of the workpiece is estimated and, assuming this power is used to remelt the substrate with the clad being pre-deposited, the melt pool shape is computed using a 3 D analytical model, which allows to obtain immediate results, even on personal computers.

40|$|When {{joining the}} {{aluminum}} alloys, {{one of the}} biggest challenges is the formation of porosity, which deteriorates mechanical properties of welds. In this study, the lap welding was conducted on an aluminum alloy 5754 metal sheets with a thickness of 2 mm. The effects of various laser welding parameters on the weld quality were investigated. The porosity content was measured by X-ray inspections. The key is to control the solidification duration of <b>molten</b> <b>pool.</b> When the solidification duration of <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> is large enough, more bubbles can escape from the <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> and less remain as porosity...|$|R
30|$|Qiu et al [28] {{observe that}} the {{porosities}} contain ridges {{in the internal}} surfaces and are thus probably associated with the incomplete re-melting of some local surfaces from the previous layers. The ridges form small volumes to which the molten metal is difficult to flow and penetrate. On the other hand, Gong et al [29] attribute these porosities to gas bubbles generated when a high laser energy {{is applied to the}} <b>molten</b> <b>pool.</b> Gas bubbles can be induced due to vaporization of low melting point constituents within an alloy. They can be far beneath the surface {{at the bottom of the}} <b>molten</b> <b>pool.</b> The high solidification rate of the <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> does not give gas bubbles sufficient time to rise and escape from the surface. Thus, gas bubbles are trapped in the <b>molten</b> <b>pool,</b> resulting in defect inclusions of regular spherical porosities in the forming part.|$|R
30|$|At a {{relatively}} low scan speed and a high laser power, the energy input is high, more powders are melted at an elevated temperature, porosity defects are created. These defects {{can be attributed to}} the entrapped gas originated from the raw material powders in the SLM process as mentioned above. In addition, low melting point constituents, e.g., Al, Mg elements in the alloy, may evaporate into gas to form gas bubbles. During the rapid solidification process in SLM, the gas bubbles do not have sufficient time to escape from the <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> to the pool surface. They remain within the <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> to form porosity defects of a spherical shape [29, 44]. On the other hand, the <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> becomes large if energy input is high, which causes powder denudation around the <b>molten</b> <b>pool.</b> The denudation process results in insufficient molten metal to fill the gap between the adjacent tracks. Large porosities are thus formed [7].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Laser welding {{includes}} the heat conduction welding {{and the deep}} penetration welding. Deep penetration welding can not only penetrate the material completely, but also can vaporize the material. An important phenomenon during deep penetration welding is that <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> in the weldment will appear a keyhole. The formation of the keyhole leads to a deep penetration weld with a high aspect ratio {{and this is the}} most advantageous feature of welding by high-energy-density beams. Small focus wandering off weld seam may result in lack of penetration or unacceptable welds, and largely reduce heating efficiency. In a fiber laser butt-joint welding of Type 304 austenitic stainless steel plate with a high power 6 kW continuous wave fiber laser, an infrared sensitive high-speed video camera was used to capture the dynamic images of the <b>molten</b> <b>pools.</b> The configurations of <b>molten</b> <b>pools</b> were analyzed through image processing techniques such as median filtering, partial Otsu threshold segmentation and Canny edge to obtain the edge of keyholes and <b>molten</b> <b>pools.</b> The circular degree and the area of keyholes and the width and average gray of <b>molten</b> <b>pools</b> were defined as characteristic parameters to reflect the seam offset between the laser beam and the weld center. By analyzing the change of characteristic parameters during welding process, it was found that these parameters were related to the seam offset. Welding experimental results and analysis of characteristic parameters confirmed that the seam offset could be monitored and distinguished by <b>molten</b> <b>pools</b> configuration during high-power fiber laser welding...|$|R

30|$|Firstly, if {{the packing}} density of metal powders is low, e.g., 50 percent, the gas present between the powder {{particles}} may dissolve in the <b>molten</b> <b>pool.</b> Because of the high cooling rate during the solidification process, the dissolved gas cannot {{come out of the}} surface of the <b>molten</b> <b>pool</b> before solidification takes place.
