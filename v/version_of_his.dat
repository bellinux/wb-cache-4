He died two years later, on 20 March 1926.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the earlier}} {{official}} <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> identification from a U.S. official, identification of al-Qaeda couriers was an early priority for interrogators at CIA black sites and the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, because bin Laden was believed to communicate through such couriers while concealing his whereabouts from al-Qaeda foot soldiers and top commanders. Bin Laden was known not to use phones after 1998, when the U.S. had launched missile strikes against his bases in Afghanistan in August by tracking an associate's satellite phone.|$|E

5|$|As the {{libel suit}} against Marshall dragged on in Mercer County Circuit Court, Innes {{and his allies}} hired author William Littell to publish Innes' <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{interactions}} with Spain.

5|$|As these laudes {{were to be}} {{performed}} with a very limited accompaniment of instruments, they were supposedly performed from the small loft in the high choir of the Thomaskirche, opposite to the large organ loft where the other movements of the Magnificat were performed.
