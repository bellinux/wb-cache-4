25|$|While {{researchers}} {{focused on}} miRNA expression in physiological and pathological processes, various technical <b>variables</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> microRNA isolation emerged. The stability of stored miRNA samples has been questioned. microRNAs degrade {{much more easily}} than mRNAs, partly due to their length, {{but also because of}} ubiquitously present RNases. This makes it necessary to cool samples on ice and use RNase-free equipment.|$|E

In 1996, QualPro {{conducted}} experiments for the National Enquirer {{to determine how}} 20 <b>variables</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> its cover, news-stand and in-store promotions effected sales. The firm tested 29 variables in Lowe's' newspaper inserts and 36 {{different versions of the}} insert's cover-page. They found that Lowe's could increase sales by featuring half as many products on the cover and that it could reduce the number of pages from 72 to 48 without an impact on sales. For AutoNation, the company tested 30 variables to improve the effectiveness of ads for local dealerships and found that the size of the ad and whether it was in color had no effect on its effectiveness, despite increased costs.|$|E

40|$|A {{report on}} the effects of {{scientific}} cluster sampling in an urban area of South Africa. Cluster sampling was popularized by the sampling procedure promoted by the WHO/UNICEF for the evaluation of the expanded programme of immunisation (EPI). Without a clear understanding of the limitations of the sampling strategy used, this sampling strategy has been extended to other types of surveys. This article shows how to approach the assessment of cluster sampling techniques scientifically by calculating design effects (DEFFs) and rates of homogeneity (roh) and illustrates this scientific assessment with three case studies from Alexandra in South Africa. We {{report on the}} DEFFs and rohs for variables studied in these surveys. The DEFF for all the <b>variables</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> housing tended to exceed two and was as high as 6, 99 for the variable new development. The <b>variables</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> health service utilisation and health practices, namely immunisation status, nutrition status, presence of Road to Health Cards (RTDCs), breast-feeding and knowledge of diarrhoea and oral rehydration all had a DEFF close <b>to</b> one.
