50|$|To {{reduce the}} {{insurance}} premium, the insured party may offer {{to pay a}} higher excess (deductible) than the compulsory excess demanded by the insurance company. The <b>voluntary</b> <b>excess</b> is the extra amount, {{over and above the}} compulsory excess, that is agreed to be paid {{in the event of a}} claim on the policy. As a bigger excess reduces the financial risk carried by the insurer, the insurer is able to offer a significantly lower premium.|$|E
40|$|Patient {{compensation}} systems are {{means by which}} two objectives can be pursued: {{the cost of the}} harm can be transferred away from the patient (the “compensation” objective); and the doctor can be given an incentive to take appropriate care to avoid making mistakes which may harm their patients (the “deterrence ” objective). All patient {{compensation systems}} attempt to deliver these objectives jointly with varying degrees of success, and with varying administration costs. The paper begins by reviewing what theory and evidence exists from various countries in relation to the impact of both existing and proposed alternatives in delivering the deterrence objective. Additionally, an empirical study was undertaken to explore for the first time inter-hospital differences in recent clinical negligence experience under the current UK system, which is based on enterprise fault liability. Data were collected from hospitals in relation to the numbers of open, closed and outstanding claims in recent years. Information about insurance arrangements, including subscriptions, <b>voluntary</b> <b>excess</b> levels and risk management discounts have also been collected. These data are analysed in the paper to identify those hospitals with claim rates significantly higher than would be expected given their casemix, and to discover whether these hospitals are systematically different in relation to their exposure to litigation risk as measured by their <b>voluntary</b> <b>excess</b> levels. The paper concludes with some policy implications. ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} shows {{that there is a}} difference between the importance people claim to attach to solidarity and to what extend that is reflected in their behavior. This study focuses on the question whether solidarity plays a role in choosing the height of the <b>voluntary</b> deductible <b>excess</b> in the health insurance. The awareness of solidarity is the point of focus. The insights into the choices made about the health insurance and the motives that play a part in it were acquired through a questionnaire among students of Utrecht University (N = 200). This study reveals that awareness of solidarity does not affect the choices made about the health insurance and the amount of <b>voluntary</b> deductible <b>excess.</b> This can be explained by the fact that the motive of solidarity is not of significant influence on the choice of the health insurance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} meaning of {{volunteering}} among professional aid workers. While they experience disenchantment in their daytime work, volunteering provides them with benefits lacking in their paid jobs. At the same time, a compensatory model does not capture the complex dimensions of this relationship. One motive behind their professional work – bringing about positive change for others - is also {{the driving force behind}} their <b>voluntary</b> practices. Such <b>excess</b> of doing good may be indicative of their overall commitment. If aid workers make sense of their actions within a framework of alienated labour, rendering their waged aid work as a commodity, volunteering emerges as a remedial response. At the same time, their paid and unpaid work is animated by the impulse of giving. Such co-existence implies that gifts and commodities are not mutually exclusive; or indeed that both can be understood, following Parry (1986), as emerging from a highly developed capitalist system...|$|R
30|$|The above {{concerns}} {{have led to}} issues of surplus liquidity or excess cash in African formal financial institutions (see Saxegaard 2006; Fouda 2009; Asongu 2014 a, p. 70). The authors have suggested measures to curb both the voluntary and involuntary holding of excess liquidity by banks. First, <b>voluntary</b> holding of <b>excess</b> cash can be reduced by: (i) helping banks to track their positions at the central bank {{to prevent them from}} keeping reserves above statutory limits; (ii) consolidating institutions that are favorable to interbank lending; and (iii) improving infrastructure to prevent remote bank branches from holding excess reserves essentially due to transportation problems. Second, involuntary keeping of surplus cash can be kept at minimum by: (i) reducing the incapacity of banks to lend in scenarios where interest rates are regulated; (ii) creating conducive conditions for commercial banks to invest surplus liquidity in bond markets; (iii) increasing investment avenues for regional banks via promotion of regional stock exchange markets; and (iv) reducing lending contraction of banks through instruments that encourage competition and mitigate information asymmetry. This line of inquiry is closest to the final point (iii) of the first strand, regarding the improvement of infrastructure.|$|R
30|$|Rodriguez [10] used a {{case study}} of bank tellers in Bogota, Colombia and showed the {{existence}} of a link between spatial choices and excess commuting. He splits commuters into two groups which were characterised as being “voluntary” or “involuntary” excess commuters. Involuntary excess commuters are those who “have the desire to reduce it [travel] at the cost of a job relocation”, whereas <b>voluntary</b> <b>excess</b> commuters have accepted the amount of travel they do “as a trade off for other benefits”. Although Rodriguez focuses on involuntary excess commuting, the distinction between the two groups of commuters highlights {{the fact that there are}} some people who prefer longer commuting for some benefits, such as access to local amenities or better accessibility to non-work destinations. He concluded that excess travel could be eliminated if individuals were to relocate so as to minimise their journey to work.|$|E
