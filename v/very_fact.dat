5|$|The fallen Kabandha again {{asked for}} the names of his vanquishers. Lakshmana {{introduced}} himself and Rama and asked the demon who he was. Kabandha narrated his story to the brothers and declared that he recognized Rama by the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> that Rama had severed his arms. Kabandha requested that Rama perform his cremation rites, offered him what information he could, and died.|$|E
5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} arrest by {{an officer}} without warrant {{and who had}} no right to arrest him, and if in the course of that resistance the officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest would be reduced from what would have been murder if the officer had had the right to arrest, to manslaughter. What would be murder if the officer had the right to arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> that he had no such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E
5|$|He {{had also}} {{continued}} to play chess, competing in the 1952 and 1956 Olympiads. This 1956 Olympiad trip to Moscow was risky, since Britain and the USSR, which had been allies during World War II, were by then locked into the Cold War, and Milner-Barry's wartime codebreaking knowledge would have been {{of great interest to}} the Soviets; the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> that Britain had broken German codes on a massive scale was kept secret until 1974, when Frederick Winterbotham's book The Ultra Secret was published. He placed second in the British Chess Championship at Hastings 1953 (finishing behind only Daniel Yanofsky), with a score of 8/11; this would be his best result in British Championships.|$|E

5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> that I was able to travel here.|$|E
25|$|Although now {{regarded}} as a cult film, Sorcerer was not received as well by the public or film critics as Friedkin's previous two films had been. American movie reviewer D. K. Holm hinted that all criticisms might have stemmed from the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> that Friedkin even dared to reimagine a French classic.|$|E
25|$|In this game, if nature selects t1 as player 1's type, {{the game}} played {{will be like}} the very first game described, except that player 2 does not know it (and the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> that this cuts through his {{information}} sets disqualify it from subgame status). There is one separating perfect Bayesian equilibrium; i.e. an equilibrium in which different types do different things.|$|E

25|$|The {{removal of}} the ban did not imply a genuine reconciliation, and no basis was gained for a {{settlement}} of the main question that divided Henry and Gregory: that of investiture. A new conflict was inevitable from the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> that Henry considered the sentence of deposition repealed along with that of excommunication. Gregory, on the other hand, was intent on reserving his freedom of action and gave no hint on the subject at Canossa.|$|E
25|$|When {{preliminary}} nibbana with substrate occurs (that is, nibbana of {{a living}} being), constructive consciousness, that is, the house-builder, is completely destroyed and no new formations will be constructed. However, sankharas {{in the sense of}} constructed consciousness, which exists as a 'karmically-resultant-consciousness' (vipāka viññāna), continue to exist. Each liberated individual produces no new karma, but preserves a particular individual personality which {{is the result of the}} traces of his or her karmic heritage. The <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> that there is a psycho-physical substrate during the remainder of an arahant's lifetime shows the continuing effect of karma.|$|E
25|$|However, this <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> (that the {{follower}} {{would play}} non-Stackelberg if the leader were to play Stackelberg) means that this profile {{is not a}} Nash equilibrium of the subgame starting when the leader has already played Stackelberg (a subgame off the equilibrium path). If the leader has already played Stackelberg, the best response of the follower is to play Stackelberg (and therefore {{it is the only}} action that yields a Nash equilibrium in this subgame). Hence the strategy profile - which is Cournot - is not subgame perfect.|$|E

25|$|Laymen {{are not to}} {{take any}} part in the {{administration}} of church affairs without the free consent of the bishop. If they usurp any such authority and divert church goods to their own use or in any way frustrate the will of the donors; or if they, even under cover of the civil law, endeavour to wrest from the bishop's hands what has been confided to his care, then such laymen by that <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> fall under the censures constituted by the Council of Trent against usurpers of ecclesiastical goods.|$|E
25|$|He is a harsh taskmaster, likes {{being the}} boss, {{and is not}} very forgiving. One of his former {{tactical}} trainees from Quantico, Liz Warner has proclaimed to this and, after Colby confided in her {{that he made a}} mistake, she told him that the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> that he still remains on Don's team means something. She also said that Don never spoke of his personal life while at the FBI Academy and was at the time fresh from the field in hunting fugitives (with friend Agent Cooper). Liz knows he has mellowed with age and he can hold a commitment with a woman for longer periods of time.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, in the Mycenaean Greek Linear B tablets, some Homeric names appear, {{including}} Achilles (Linear B: , a-ki-re-u), a name {{which was}} also common in the classical period, noted on tablets from both Knossos and Pylos. The Achilles of the Linear B tablet is a shepherd, not a king or warrior, but the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> that the name is an authentic Bronze Age name is significant. These names in the Homeric poems presumably remember, if not necessarily specific people, at least an older time when people's names were {{not the same as}} they were when the Homeric epics were written down. Some story elements from the tablets appear in the Iliad.|$|E

60|$|Against which passage Charles, reading {{over the}} play before he allowed of it, had written, 'This is too insolent, {{and not to}} be printed.' Too insolent it {{certainly}} was, considering the state of public matters in the year 1638. It would be interesting enough to analyse the reasons which made Charles dislike in the mouth of Pedro sentiments so very like his own; but we must proceed, only pointing out the way in which men, determined to repeat the traditional clap- trap about the Stuarts, are actually blind to the meaning of the <b>very</b> <b>facts</b> which they themselves quote.|$|R

25|$|During this time, Muslim {{reformer}} and educationist Sir Syed Ahmad Khan {{began to}} argue {{for the importance of}} the British education. Sir Syed was a jurist and a scholar who was knighted by the British Crown for his services to British Empire. Witnessing this atmosphere of despair and despondency, Sir Syed launched his attempts to revive the spirit of progress within the Muslim community of British India. At notable Muslim gatherings, he argued that the Muslims, in their attempt to regenerate themselves, had failed to realise that mankind had entered a very important phase of its existence—an era of science and learning. Despite harsh criticism from the Islamic orthodoxy, he helped convince many Muslim communities to realise that the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> was the source of progress and prosperity for the British. Therefore, modern education became the pivot of his movement for regeneration of the Indian Muslims. He tried to transform the Muslim outlook from a medieval one to a modern one.|$|E
25|$|Having England {{as an ally}} {{meant that}} the {{military}} situation of the Republic was strongly improved, but this <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> induced William to be uncompromising in his position towards France. This policy led to {{a large number of}} very expensive campaigns which were largely paid for with Dutch funds. In 1712 the Republic was financially exhausted; it withdrew from international politics and was forced to let its fleet deteriorate, making what was by then the Kingdom of Great Britain the dominant maritime power of the world. The Dutch economy, already burdened by the high national debt and concomitant high taxation, suffered from the other European states' protectionist policies, which its weakened fleet was no longer able to resist. To make matters worse, the main Dutch trading and banking houses moved much of their activity from Amsterdam to London after 1688. Between 1688 and 1720, world trade dominance shifted from the Republic to Britain.|$|E
500|$|In 1692, Peter, who by {{then was}} Tsar of Russia, {{organized}} himself and several dozen {{of his friends}} into The All-Joking, All-Drunken Synod of Fools and Jesters, a [...] "synod" [...] that parodied religion. Although he {{had a reputation for}} sobriety and fasting, Zotov was appointed the [...] "Prince-Pope" [...] of the Synod because of that <b>very</b> <b>fact.</b> He was sometimes even referred to as Patriarch Bacchus. Peter forced him to participate in the parties even when Zotov claimed sickness and exhaustion.|$|E

500|$|Kiarostami {{has said}} of his film making: [...] "An artist designs and creates a piece hoping to {{materialize}} some thoughts, concepts or feelings through his or her medium. The credibility of great Persian poets like Rumi and Hafez comes from the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> that they are composed {{in such a way}} that they are fresh and meaningful regardless of the time, place and conditions in which you read them—and this means reading them while doing divination or simply as literature." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Hogg {{worked on a}} {{collection}} of her father's papers and speeches with his biographer, historian Robert C.

According to Bernhard, [...] "the <b>very</b> <b>fact</b> that Ima had been burdened with a name that made a lifetime of explanations necessary also made her anxious to defend her father from all detractors. By doing so, she defended herself as well, and she did so with considerable skill and unfailing politeness." ...|$|E
