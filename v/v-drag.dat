40|$|Caffeine {{has been}} widely {{acknowledged}} for its ergogenic benefits during endurance performance; however, these effects are unclear within team sport performance, as this area has had considerably less attention. Current field based team sport protocols exclude important physical and psychological aspects of performance, especially within field hockey players. Therefore, {{the purpose of the}} present study was to investigate the effects of caffeine on physical and psychological performance during a specially designed circuit to simulate field hockey performance. Methods: Twelve university, female hockey players (Mean ± SD: Age 20 ± 1 years, Height 165. 33 ± 4. 91 cm, Mass 66. 1 ± 8. 97 kg) took part in a double-blind, randomised, repeated measures design where they were given a caffeine (6 mg·kg- 1) or placebo beverage 60 minutes prior to completing the Field Hockey Specific Circuit (FHSC). Participants had to complete three rounds of the six station circuit; IADT, 15 m sprint, <b>v-drag,</b> 15 m sprint, ATT and goal shooting. Times taken to complete IADT, ATT and the overall circuit were recorded throughout. Psychological measures were collected pre, during and post completion of the circuit, which included Feeling and Felt Arousal Scale scores, alongside choice reaction times from a specially designed arrow flanker Super lab programme. Results: There was no significant difference between conditions for IADT times (P > 0. 05), ATT times (P > 0. 05) or FHSC completion times (P > 0. 05). There was a significant difference in feeling and felt arousal scale scores but only in the ‘pre’ stage of testing (P 0. 05). Caffeine did reduce mean times across physical variables and reaction times in comparison to the placebo but not large enough to be significantly different. Conclusion: Caffeine did not significantly improve physical performance or choice reaction times in female field hockey players during a field hockey specific circuit. However, caffeine significantly improved mood and arousal levels before taking part in the protocol. Thus indicating that caffeine may be advantageous for an athletes psychological functioning.
