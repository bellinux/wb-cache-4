40|$|Abstract. We {{provide a}} new {{characterization}} of certain zero-knowledge protocols as non-interactive instance-dependent commitment-schemes (NIC). To obtain this result {{we consider the}} notion of <b>V-bit</b> protocols, which are very common, and found many applications in zero-knowledge. Our characterization result states that a protocol has a <b>V-bit</b> zero-knowledge protocol {{if and only if}} it has a NIC. TheNIC inherits its hiding property from the zero-knowledge property of the protocol, and vice versa. Our characterization result yields a framework that strengthens and simplifies many zero-knowledge protocols in various settings. For example, applying this framework to the result of Micciancio et al. [18] (who showed that some problems, including GRAPH-NONISOMORPHISM and QUADRATIC-RESIDUOUSITY, unconditionally have a concurrent zero-knowledge proof) we easily get that arbitrary, monotone boolean formulae over a large class of problems (which contains, e. g., the complement of any random self-reducible problem) unconditionally have a concurrent zero-knowledge proof...|$|E
40|$|Sequence {{generators}} {{obtained by}} linear recursions over the two-element field F_ 2, i. e., F_ 2 -linear generators, {{are widely used}} as pseudorandom number generators. For example, the Mersenne Twister MT 19937 {{is one of the}} most successful applications. An advantage of such generators is that we can assess them quickly by using theoretical criteria, such as the dimension of equidistribution with <b>v-bit</b> accuracy. To compute these dimensions, several polynomial-time lattice reduction algorithms have been proposed in the case of F_ 2 -linear generators. In this paper, in order to assess non-random bit patterns in dimensions that are higher than the dimension of equidistribution with <b>v-bit</b> accuracy,we focus on the relationship between points in the Couture [...] L'Ecuyer dual lattices and F_ 2 -linear relations on the most significant v bits of output sequences, and consider a new figure of merit N_v based on the minimum weight of F_ 2 -linear relations whose degrees are minimal for v. Next, we numerically show that MT 19937 has low-weight F_ 2 -linear relations in dimensions higher than 623, and show that some output vectors with specific lags are rejected or have small p-values in the birthday spacings tests. We also report that some variants of Mersenne Twister, such as WELL generators, are significantly improved from the perspective of N_v. Comment: 19 page...|$|E
40|$|The 32 -bit Mersenne Twister {{generator}} MT 19937 is {{a widely}} used random number generator. To generate numbers with more than 32 bits in bit length, and particularly when converting into 53 -bit double-precision floating-point numbers in [0, 1) in the IEEE 754 format, the typical implementation concatenates two successive 32 -bit integers and divides them by a power of 2. In this case, the 32 -bit MT 19937 is optimized {{in terms of its}} equidistribution properties (the so-called dimension of equidistribution with <b>v-bit</b> accuracy) under the assumption that one will mainly be using 32 -bit output values, and hence the concatenation sometimes degrades the dimension of equidistribution compared with the simple use of 32 -bit outputs. In this paper, we analyze such phenomena by investigating hidden F_ 2 -linear relations among the bits of high-dimensional outputs. Accordingly, we report that MT 19937 with a specific lag set fails several statistical tests, such as the overlapping collision test, matrix rank test, and Hamming independence test.
