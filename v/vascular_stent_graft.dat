40|$|ObjectiveThis report {{summarizes}} the 30 -day and 12 -month results of endovascular treatment using the Medtronic <b>Vascular</b> Talent Thoracic <b>Stent</b> <b>Graft</b> System (Medtronic <b>Vascular,</b> Santa Rosa, Calif) {{for patients with}} thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) who are considered candidates for open surgical repair. MethodsThe study was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, pivotal trial conducted at 38 sites. Enrollment occurred between December 2003 and June 2005. Standard follow-up interval examinations were prescribed at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. These endovascular results were compared with retrospective open surgical data from three centers of excellence. ResultsThe Evaluation of the Medtronic <b>Vascular</b> Talent Thoracic <b>Stent</b> <b>Graft</b> System for the Treatment of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms (VALOR) trial enrolled 195 patients, and 189 were identified as retrospective open surgical subjects. Compared with the open surgery group, the VALOR test group had similar age and sex distributions, but had a smaller TAA size. Patients received a mean number of 2. 7 ± 1. 3 <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> components. The diameters of 25 % of the proximal <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> components implanted were 40 mm. Left subclavian artery revascularization was performed before the initial <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> procedure in 5. 2 % of patients. Iliac conduits were used in 21. 1 % of patients. In 33. 5 % of patients, the bare spring segment of the most proximally implanted device was in zones 1 or 2 of the aortic arch. In 194 patients (99. 5 %), vessel access and <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> deployment were successful at the intended site. The 30 -day VALOR results included perioperative mortality, 2. 1 %; major adverse advents, 41 %; incidence of paraplegia, 1. 5 %; paraparesis, 7. 2 %; and stroke, 3. 6 %. The 12 -month VALOR results included all-cause mortality, 16. 1 %; aneurysm-related mortality, 3. 1 %; conversion to open surgery, 0. 5 %; target aneurysm rupture, 0. 5 %; <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> migration > 10 mm, 3. 9 %; endoleak (12. 2 %), <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> patency, 100 %; stable or decreasing aneurysm diameter, 91. 5 %; and loss of <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> integrity, four patients. No deployment-related events or perforation of the aorta by a graft component occurred. The Talent Thoracic <b>Stent</b> <b>Graft</b> showed statistically superior performance with respect to acute procedural outcomes (P <. 001), 30 -day major adverse events (41 % vs 84. 4 %, P <. 001), perioperative mortality (2 % vs 8 %, P <. 01), and 12 -month aneurysm-related mortality (3. 1 % vs 11. 6 %, P <. 002) vs open surgery.

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{report the}} 5 -year {{outcomes}} of thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) using the Medtronic <b>Vascular</b> Talent Thoracic <b>Stent</b> <b>Graft</b> System (Medtronic <b>Vascular,</b> Santa Rosa, Calif) in patients considered low or moderate risk for open surgical repair. MethodsThe Evaluation of the Medtronic <b>Vascular</b> Talent Thoracic <b>Stent</b> <b>Graft</b> System for the Treatment of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms (VALOR) trial was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, pivotal study conducted at 38 U. S. sites. Between December 2003 and June 2005, VALOR enrolled 195 {{patients who were}} low or moderate risk (0, 1, and 2) per the modified Society for Vascular Surgery and American Association for Vascular Surgery criteria. The patients had fusiform thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) and/or focal saccular TAAs/penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers. Standard follow-up interval examinations were conducted at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. ResultsOver the 5 -year follow-up, 76 deaths occurred (43. 9 %). Freedom from all-cause mortality was 83. 9 % at 1 year and 58. 5 % at 5 years. Most deaths were due to cardiac, pulmonary or cancer-related causes. Freedom from aneurysm-related mortality (ARM) was 96. 9 % at 1 year and 96. 1 % at 5 years. There was only 1 case of ARM {{after the first year}} of follow-up. Over the 5 -year follow-up period, four patients were converted to open surgery and four patients experienced aneurysm rupture. The 5 -year freedom from aneurysm rupture was 97. 1 % and the 5 -year freedom from conversion to surgery was 97. 1 %. The incidence of <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> migration (> 10 mm) was ≤ 1. 8 % in each year of follow-up. The rate of type I endoleak was 4. 6 % at 1 month, 6. 3 % from 1 month to 1 year, and 3. 8 % during year 5. The rate of type III endoleak was 1. 3 % at 1 month, 1. 9 % from 1 month to 1 year, and 1. 9 % during year 5. Through 5 years, 28 patients (14. 4 %) underwent 31 additional endovascular procedures on the original target lesion. The 5 -year freedom from secondary endovascular procedures was 81. 5 %. ConclusionsThrough 5 -year follow-up in patients who were candidates for open surgical repair, TEVAR using the Talent Thoracic <b>Stent</b> <b>Graft</b> System has demonstrated sustained protection from ARM, aneurysm rupture, and conversion to surgery, and durable <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> performance.

S. sites with enrollment between December 2006 and September 2009. Standard follow-up examinations, including physical examination, computed tomography, and chest radiography, were at 1, 6, and 12 months, and annually through 5 years. VALOR II outcomes were compared with those from the pivotal VALOR (Evaluation of the Medtronic <b>Vascular</b> Talent Thoracic <b>Stent</b> <b>Graft</b> System for the Treatment of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms) trial of the Talent <b>stent</b> <b>graft,</b> which enrolled 195 patients with similar enrollment criteria.

Compared with VALOR patients, VALOR II patients had similar age and sex distribution but higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors and significantly more severe modified Society for Vascular Surgery/American Association for Vascular Surgery risk scores. <b>Stent</b> <b>graft</b> delivery and deployment were successful in 154 patients (96. 3 %). Outcomes at 30 days in VALOR II were perioperative mortality, 3. 1 %; major adverse events, 38. 1 %; paraplegia, 0. 6 %; paraparesis, 1. 9 %; and stroke, 2. 5 %. At 12 months, after the minimum sample size was reached, 151 patients were evaluated: aneurysm-related mortality was 4. 0 %, <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> migration was 2. 9 %, and endoleak was 13. 0 %. Through 12 months, there were no ruptures, conversions to open surgery, secondary procedures due to endoleak > 30 days, or loss of <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> patency.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{manufacture}} a new aortic model with physiological properties, which could be used for long-term durability testing of endovascular stent-grafts, as per the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration. METHODS: Porcine abdominal aortas were acquired to establish values for compliance. The aortic model was manufactured using a nanocomposite polymer. Latex mock aorta was used for comparison. A pulsatile flow phantom perfused the aortas and synthetic tubes at physiological pulse pressure and flow. Diametrical compliance and stiffness index were calculated over mean pressures from 30 to 120 mm Hg. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni's test. RESULTS: Flow circuit hemodynamic values were similar for porcine aorta and synthetic tubes. Compliance of aorta ranged from 2. 97 ± 0. 72 (mean ± SD) to 1. 42 ± 0. 37 %/mm Hg × 10 ⁻². The polymer model showed significantly better compliance (range, 3. 66 ± 1. 05 - 2. 72 ± 0. 28 %/mm Hg × 10 ⁻²; p 0. 05). It also showed anisotropic behavior similar to the aorta. Latex tubes showed compliance that was lower than that in aorta (range, 0. 87 ± 0. 24 - 0. 86 ± 0. 2 %/mm Hg × 10 ⁻²) and failed by a significant distension on increase in pressure from mean of 90 mm Hg.

However, {{few studies have}} been reported on <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> compliance. This study aims to explore the deformation and compliance of <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> in <b>stented</b> and unstented zones under three pressure ranges. Compliance of two <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> incorporated with polyurethane graft (nitinol-PU) and polyester graft (nitinol-PET) materials respectively were tested; the stents used in the two <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> were identical. For the circumferential deformation of the <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> under each pressure range, the nitinol-PET <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> was uniform in both zones. The nitinol-PU <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> was circumferentially uniform in the stented zone, however, it was nonuniform in the unstented zone. The compliance of the PU graft material was 15 times higher than that of the PET graft. No significant difference in compliance was observed between stented and unstented zones of the nitinol-PET <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> regardless of the applied pressure range. However, for the nitinol-PU <b>stent</b> <b>graft,</b> compliance of the unstented PU region was approximately twice that of the stented region; thus, compliance {{along the length of the}} nitinol-PU <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> was not constant and different from that of the nitinol-PET <b>stent</b> <b>graft...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Patients {{suffering}} from acute type A aortic dissection undergo {{replacement of the}} ascending aorta, the proximal hemiarch or complete aortic arch, depending {{on the extent of}} the individual pathology. In a subset of these treated patients, secondary pathologies of the distal anastomosis or the remaining distal part of the aorta occur. The treatment of these pathologies is challenging, requiring major surgical re-do procedures with aortic arch replacement under extracorporeal circulation and hypothermic circulatory arrest. Methods: We report our experience of five patients with complex aortic pathologies after previous aortic surgery treated with a single stage re-do hybrid procedure, consisting of bypass grafting of the supraaortic branches off-pump, <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> placement for endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) and surgical debranching of the aortic arch. Results: In all patients the surgical <b>vascular</b> <b>grafts</b> and <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> were deployed successfully, there were no intraoperative deaths. Four out of five patients were discharged from hospital in good clinical condition. One patient died postoperatively due to cardiac tamponade. In one patient a type I endoleak persisted leading to occlusion of a bypass branch requiring surgical revision at one year after debranching. Conclusion: We discuss the prerequisites, all steps and potential pitfalls of this hybrid aortic arch replacement. The current procedure avoids cardiopulmonary bypass and circulatory arrest, which may benefit early patient outcome; however, patient and device selection plays a key role for immediate success and midterm outcomes. In addition, precise procedural planning and development of customized stents may help to develop this procedure into a true alternative for conventional aortic arch replacement...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Thoracic {{endovascular}} aortic repair (TEVAR) {{has been}} shown to lead to increased aortic stiffness. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> type and <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> length on aortic stiffness in a controlled, experimental setting. METHODS: Twenty porcine thoracic aortas were connected to a pulsatile mock loop system. Intraluminal pressure was recorded at two sites in order to measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) for each aorta: before <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> deployment (t 1); after deployment of a 100 -mm long <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> (t 2); and after distal extension through deployment of a second 100 -mm long <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> (t 3). Four different types of <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> (Conformable Gore® TAG® Device, Bolton Relay® Device, Cook Zenith Alpha™, and Medtronic Valiant®) were evaluated. RESULTS: For the total cohort of 20 aortas, PWV increased by a mean 0. 6 m/s or 8. 9 % of baseline PWV after deployment of a 100 -mm proximal <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> (P< 0. 001), and by a mean 1. 4 m/s or 23. 0 % of baseline PWV after distal extension of the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Objectives: Long-term {{durability}} after endovascular aortic repair {{is influenced}} by <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> migration causing types I and III endoleaks. Flow induced displacement forces {{have been shown to}} have the potential to cause migration. In this study, the influence of the distal diameter of iliac limb <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> and the shape of graft curvature on flow induced displacement forces, were investigated. Methods: In an experimental pulsatile flow model mimicking aortic conditions in vivo, flow induced displacement forces at the proximal and distal ends of iliac limb <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> were studied at different angles (0 - 90 degrees) and perfusion pressures (145 / 80, 170 / 90, 195 / 100 mmHg). Bell-bottomed, tapered, and non-tapered <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> and also asymmetric <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> curvatures at 90 bend were studied. Measurements of graft movement were performed at all studied angulations and graft shapes. Results: For all <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> diameters, flow induced displacement forces increased with higher pressure and increased <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> angulation. Forces in the bell-bottom graft were considerably higher than in tapered and non-tapered grafts, with a markedly elevated peak force at the distal end (proximal end, 2. 3 +/- 0. 06 N and distal end, 6. 9 +/- 0. 05 N compared with 1. 7 +/- 0. 08 N and 1. 6 +/- 0. 08 N in non-tapered grafts; p <. 001 both). Peak forces in tapered and non-tapered grafts were not significantly different between the proximal and distal end. In asymmetric <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> curvatures, a significant increase in displacement forces was observed in the attachment zone that was closest to the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> bend.

Reports claim the superiority of <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> and recommend these as a first-line treatment. We have observed {{a rise in the}} number of complications related to <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> in our patients. The following study was undertaken to assess the severity of these complications and their effect on access site maintenance. MethodsWe reviewed all patients who had endovascular <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> placed for treatment of failing dialysis access over the last 44 months. A series of 38 consecutively placed <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> was reviewed for stent migration, fracture, erosion, hemorrhage, and rupture at the site of the <b>stent</b> <b>grafts.</b> Hospital charts were reviewed to assess for indications, hemodynamic stability, transfusion requirement, and outcome. ResultsOf 38 <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> placed, nine were for pseudoaneurysm (PS), 20 for stenosis (ST), and nine for a combination (PS/ST). The average length of follow-up was 218. 6 days. Primary patency was 49 %, with an assisted primary patency of 76 %. Eleven patients (28. 9 %) presented with complications related to migration, fracture, erosion, or rupture. Six were in the PS, three in the PS/ST, and two in the ST treatment groups. In all cases, migration or fracture of the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> led to recurrent pseudoaneurysm formation or erosion. Rupture occurred after a herald bleed in four cases. Once complication occurred, 10 of the 11 access sites had to be abandoned.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether radiographically demonstrated proximal <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> contour can be used as a marker for security of proximal neck fixation after endovascular aneurysm repair. Methods: <b>Stent</b> <b>graft</b> structure was examined in 100 consecutive patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms who were treated with the <b>stent</b> <b>graft.</b> <b>Stent</b> <b>graft</b> integrity, <b>stent</b> contour, angulation, compression, and position were assessed by use of plain abdominal radiography, and the results were correlated with contrast computed tomography (CT) scanning, clinical findings, and outcomes. Repeated imaging was carried out during follow-up of 3 to 38 (mean, 12) months. Results: <b>Stent</b> <b>graft</b> repair was successful in all 100 patients. No stent fractures were identified. Concentric compression of the proximal portion of the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> was visible in 69 % of patients and reflected deliberate oversizing of the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> at the time of implantation. In 5 % of patients, a short eccentric compression deformity of the proximal stent was observed. This finding was associated with an increased risk of <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> migration (P <. 01) and with an increased risk for development of a late proximal (type I) endoleak (P <. 01). Compared with CT scanning, abdominal radiography was less useful for assessment of short distances of migration (sensitivity 67 %; specificity 79 %). However, they provided better definition of the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> in relation to bony landmarks and better visualization of aortic calcification than CT with three-dimensional reconstruction. Conclusion: Plain abdominal radiographs are important in the postoperative evaluation of patients with aortic <b>stent</b> <b>grafts.</b> They allow for more precise evaluation of the structural elements of the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> than CT scanning and may disclose inadequate proximal fixation by demonstration of an eccentric compression deformity.

40|$|Background: <b>Stent</b> <b>grafts</b> {{are used}} to treat aortic aneurysms, as a minimal {{invasive}} alternative to open surgery. The aorta is accessed via percutaneous punctures in the groins and insertion of guide wires. A <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> is advanced over the guide wire and deployed in the desired position, using x-ray fluoroscopic guidance. The procedure significantly reduces short-term morbidity and mortality compared to open repair, but has {{a higher rate of}} late complications and re-interventions. Two possible complications are: release of air bubbles during thoracic <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> deployment may lead to cerebral embolization and immediate stroke, and long-term migration due to flow-induced forces may lead to leakage into the aneurysm sack and remaining risk of aortic rupture. Objectives: <b>Stent</b> <b>grafts</b> are compressed in a long, soft and thin delivery catheter. Once the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> is in position, the surgeon withdraws the catheter, allowing the self-expanding <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> to expand radially to the artery wall, or to a previously inserted <b>stent</b> <b>graft.</b> The <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> is kept in place by the expansion force of the over-sized stent, and in some cases by anchoring hooks. Despite a strict preparation procedure, there is a risk that air is trapped in the compressed <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> and released into the aorta during deployment. The present work describes two of our studies. In the first experimental study we measure the total amount of air released by two different brands of thoracic <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> and investigate the size and origin of the air bubbles. In the second experimental and numerical study angulated iliac limbs <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> are mounted in a pulsatile flow model to determine the flow-induced displacement forces under a variety of conditions. Methods: The air release measurements and visualizations are performed by inserting and deploying <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> in a closed water-filled container. A high-resolution and high-speed camera is used to capture the air release process, and the total amount of air collected in the container is measured. An experimental pulsatile flow model, with conditions similar to aortic in vivo conditions, is used to measure the proximal and distal displacement forces of iliac <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> under different angulations, pulsation frequencies, pressures, and configurations (tapered, tubular, bellbottom). Fluid-structure interaction simulations {{are used to}} determine the forces numerically. Results: We found that air is released during deployment of thoracic <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> and that the largest bubbles come from the proximal end. There is {{a significant difference between the}} two brands of <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> that have been investigated. The flow-induced forces are under some conditions comparable to the forces required to extract the iliac limb <b>stent</b> <b>grafts.</b> Both the forces and the graft movements increase with angulation and with perfusion pressure, but not with stroke rate. The distal displacement forces are particularly large for the bellbottom configuration. The origin of the forces is mainly the pressure, while the contributions of shear force and flow redirection are insignificant. The flexibility of the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> material reduces the forces (by 15 % under the conditions in the numerical simulations in the present work). Conclusions: New packing and/or preparation procedures should be developed to reduce the amount of air released during deployment of thoracic <b>stent</b> <b>grafts.</b> Improved anchoring of the distal ends of <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> should be considered.

40|$|ObjectiveStent grafts are {{increasingly}} recognized as useful devices for endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms and other <b>vascular</b> diseases. <b>Stent</b> graft-mediated gene delivery into the vascular wall {{is expected to}} improve their therapeutic effects. This study evaluated the efficacy of genetically engineered cationized gelatin (CG) hydrogel-coated partially-covered polyester <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> that facilitate delivery of an expression plasmid DNA in rabbit aortic wall. MethodsPartially covered polyester <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> coated with CG hydrogel impregnated with 10. 0 mg/mL of β-galactosidase (LacZ) -expression plasmid vector (pCAGGS-LacZ) or empty vector (pCAGGS) solutions were implanted via the femoral artery in rabbit balloon-injured aortas. The aortic segments were removed at 1, 3, or 7 days (4 rabbits/each group) after implantation and evaluated for the transgene (LacZ) delivery and expression by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and X-gal (5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl-β-D-galactoside) staining. Partially-covered polyester <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> coated with CG hydrogel impregnated with various amounts (0. 1 mg/mL, 1. 0 mg/mL, and 10. 0 mg/mL) of pCAGGS-LacZ or pCAGGS were also implanted in rabbits' balloon-injured aortas (4 rabbits/each group) to evaluate transgene delivery and expression in the aortic wall 3 days after implantation. The difference of transgene efficiency among each group was compared using {{one-way analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) and Newman-Keuls' test according to the result of quantitative RT-PCR. ResultsIn all animals, LacZ gene transduction into the aortic wall was detected at the implantation site of pCAGGS-LacZ-loaded, but not pCAGGS-loaded, <b>stent</b> <b>grafts.</b> LacZ expression was not detected in aortic segments immediately proximal or distal to the implanted pCAGGS-LacZ-loaded <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> or remote organs including the brain, heart, liver, and kidney by either RT-PCR or X-gal staining. The X-gal staining-positive cells were observed at or near the luminal surface in the aortic segments only in contact with the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> and the ingrowth tissues within <b>stent</b> <b>grafts.</b> Immunohistochemical studies suggested that the LacZ-positive cells were mainly the neointimal α-smooth-muscle actin-positive cells and macrophages. The extent of the transgene expression was dependent on the quantity of the plasmid DNA loaded onto the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> (10. 0 mg/mL plasmid vs 1. 0 mg/mL plasmid, P <. 01 and 10. 0 mg/mL plasmid vs 0. 1 mg/mL plasmid, P <. 05). LacZ mRNA expression was maximal at day 1 and declined at day 7 (P <. 05) but was still detectable. ConclusionPlasmid-loaded CG hydrogel-coated <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> is a promising vehicle for local transgene delivery to the aortic wall and offers the possibility of transduction of therapeutic genes into the vascular wall.

During an 18 -month period, 250 patients with infrarenal aneurysms underwent treatment at 12 study sites— 190 patients underwent endovascular repair using the Medtronic AneuRx <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> (Sunnyvale, Calif), and 60 underwent open surgical repair. There {{was no significant difference}} in operative mortality rates between the groups. The patients who underwent <b>stent</b> <b>grafting</b> had significant reductions in blood loss, time to extubation, and days in the intensive care unit and in the hospital, with an earlier return to function. The major morbidity rate was reduced from 23 % in the surgery group to 12 % (P <. 05) in the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> group. There was no difference in the combined morbidity/mortality rates between the two groups. Primary technical success at the time of discharge for the patients with <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> was 77 %, largely as a result of a 21 % endoleak rate. At 1 month, the endoleak rate had decreased to 9 %. There was no difference in the primary or secondary procedure success rates at 30 days between the surgery and <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> groups. The primary graft patency rate at 6 months was 98 % in the surgery group and 97 % in the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> group. The aneurysm exclusion rate at 1 month and 6 months was 100 % in patients who underwent surgery and 91 % in patients who underwent <b>stent</b> <b>grafting.</b> <b>Stent</b> <b>graft</b> migration occurred in three patients and resulted in late endoleaks; each endoleak was corrected by means of endovascular placement of a <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> extender cuff. There have been no aneurysm ruptures and no surgical conversions to open repair in the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> group. <b>Stent</b> <b>graft</b> repair compares favorably with open surgical repair, with a reduced morbidity rate, shortened hospital stays, and satisfactory short term outcomes.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{concerns the}} structural design of medical <b>stent</b> <b>grafts.</b> A {{new type of}} an innovative <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> has been developed. Unlike the conventional <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> which consist of a wire mesh and a covering membrane, the proposed <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> {{can be made from}} a single folded sheet of material. Firstly, a detailed symmetric design of a foldable cylindrical tube for the new <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> has been presented. Folding is achieved by dividing the structure into a series of identical elements with hill and valley folds as in origami (Japanese art of paper folding). The folding patterns allow the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> to be folded and expanded both radially and longitudinally. The relationships among the design of the elements, the number of elements in the circumferential and longitudinal directions and the folded dimensions of the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> have been derived. It has been found that compact folding in the radial direction can be achieved by increasing the number of circumferential elements. A geometric mismatch during deployment has also been identified. The elements have to deform when the structure is expanded. Optimum designs which minimise the deformation have been found. Secondly, a new <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> with helical folds has also been designed to improve radial strength and ease the deployment process. Helical folds are introduced by adjusting the joining position of the two edges of a sheet that had been symmetrically jointed in the symmetric design. The relationships among the number of elements in one complete circumference of a helix, the helical angle and the radius of the helical type <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> have been established. The locations for the helical folds are optimised for easy folding by considering both geometric aspects of folding and the buckling patterns of a thin-walled tube under torsion, which are found analytically. Thirdly, using numerical analysis of the finite element method (FEM) the strain level and overall deformation of the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> during deployment has been calculated. Finally, the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> has been manufactured to verify the concept. A number of prototypes of the <b>stent</b> <b>graft,</b> which are the same size as standard oesophageal and aortal <b>stent</b> <b>grafts,</b> have been produced successfully using the same materials as current <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> of stainless steel and shape memory alloy (SMA) sheets. The patterns of folds on the materials are produced by photochemical etching. It has also been demonstrated that the SMA <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> self-expand smoothly and gradually by a near body temperature. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|PurposeTo {{review the}} {{indications}} and results of open surgical and endovascular treatment for ureteral-iliac artery fistula (UIAF). MethodsWe reviewed the clinical data of 20 consecutive patients treated for 21 UIAFs between 1996 and 2010. Since 2004, iliac artery <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> {{were the primary}} treatment except for complex fistulas with enteric contamination or abscess. Endpoints were early morbidity and mortality, patient survival, vessel or graft patency, freedom from <b>vascular</b> or <b>stent</b> graft/graft infection, and freedom from recurrent bleeding. ResultsThere were 20 patients, 15 females, and five males, with mean age of 63 ± 13 years. Predisposing factors for UIAF were prior tumor resection in 18 patients, radiation in 15, ureteral stents in 15, ileal conduits in four, and ileofemoral grafts in three. All patients presented with hematuria, which was massive in 10. Treatment included iliac <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> in 11 patients/ 12 fistulas (55 %), with internal iliac artery (IAA) exclusion in nine, femoral crossover graft with IAA exclusion in five, direct arterial repair in three, and ureteral exclusion with percutaneous nephrostomy and no arterial repair in one. There were no early deaths. Five of eight patients treated by open surgical repair developed complications, which included enterocutaneous fistula in three and superficial wound infection in two. Four patients (36 %) treated by iliac <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> had complications, including pneumonia, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, buttock claudication, and early stent occlusion in one each. After a median follow-up of 26 months, no one had recurrent massive hematuria, but minor bleeding was reported in three. Patient survival at 5 years was 42 % compared with 93 % for the general population (P <. 001). Freedom from any recurrent bleeding at 3 years was 76 %. In the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> group, primary and secondary patency rates and freedom from <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> infection at 3 years were 81 %, 92 %, and 100 %. ConclusionsUIAF is a rare complication associated with prior tumor resection, radiation, and indwelling ureteral stents. In select patients without enteric communication or abscess, iliac artery <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> are safe and effective treatment, and carry a low risk of recurrent massive hematuria or <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> infection on early follow-up.

40|$|We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the article by Eggebrecht and cowork-ers. 1 They concluded {{that the majority of}} retrograde ascending aortic dissection cases were {{associated with the use of}} proximal bare spring <b>stent</b> <b>grafts.</b> The authors report that this decision is strengthened by evidence of stent graft–induced injury at surgery or necropsy in half of the patients.

40|$|Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is a {{technique}} which uses <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> to treat aortic aneurysms in patients at risk of aneurysm rupture. Although this technique {{has been shown to}} be very successful on the short term, the long term results are less optimistic due to failure of the <b>stent</b> <b>graft.</b> The pulsating blood flow applies stresses and forces to the <b>stent</b> <b>graft,</b> which can cause problems such as breakage, leakage, and migration.

40|$|PurposeA {{straight}} thoracic <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> often complies poorly {{with the}} {{curvature of the}} aortic arch. We have previously reported an in vitro model of a modified <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> that can be bent in situ after deployment to improve conformance to the aortic arch. We now report the first clinical experience with this technique in three consecutive patients. MethodsBetween September 2007 and August 2008, three patients were treated for different pathologies of the aortic arch with a modified thoracic <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> that was fitted with a sliding self-locking knot and a detachable Bowden cable. Transfemoral traction on the Bowden cable enables controlled shortening of the proximal part of the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> at the inner curve after deployment. The <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> is thereby directed to allow for better apposition to the aortic wall. ResultsThe modified thoracic <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> were correctly orientated and deployed in all patients. Transfemoral traction on the Bowden cable successfully bent all <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> and improved vessel wall apposition without a residual gap on the inner curve. The Bowden cable was successfully released and withdrawn in all patients. ConclusionIn situ bending of thoracic <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> with a sliding self-locking knot is feasible and improves proximal apposition of the device at the inner curve of the aortic arch. More data and longer follow-up are required to confirm the applicability of this technique...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: The first {{endovascular}} <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> was implanted {{to treat}} an abdominal aortic aneurysm {{more than a}} decade ago. This technique has evolved dramatically with the growing understanding of metallurgic and fabric sciences and improved device designs. However the potential for <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> material failure remains. This investigation describes the incidence of material failure, potential modes of device fatigue, and the clinical significance of these failures. Methods: Six hundred eighty-six endovascular <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> were used to treat patients with aortic aneurysms. Device fatigue in the form of stent, suture fracture, or graft wear was identified with an analysis of follow-up radiographs and explanted <b>stent</b> <b>grafts.</b> A review of patient clinical histories, spiral computed tomographic scan studies, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersion spectroscopy of explanted devices was conducted to evaluate the modes and consequences of failure. Results: Sixty patients were identified with device fatigue, 49 of whom had abdominal endovascular repairs and 11 of whom had thoracic repairs. Of the 60 patients with <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> fatigue, 43 patients had metallic stent fractures, 14 had suture disruptions, and three had graft holes. These material failures occurred within seven distinct <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> designs. The average time to the recognition of failure was 19 months, with a mean follow-up period of 8 months since the event was identified. Eleven patients died, and one was lost to follow-up 2 years after identification of a stent fracture. The remaining patients are presently being followed eoyj physical examination, plain film radiograph, and computed tomographic scans for clinical sequelae of device fatigue. Conclusion: Endovascular <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> fatigue has been recognized in numerous devices after aortic implantation. Fatigue may take the form of <b>stent,</b> <b>graft,</b> or suture failure, with certain modes unique to specific <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> devices.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveEndovascular {{aneurysm}} repair is {{an alternative}} treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The procedure is less invasive, and morbidity and most probably mortality are reduced. However, some problems, such as endoleakage, are yet to be resolved. Endoleakage can occur after graft migration, {{as a result of}} insufficient fixation of the <b>stent</b> <b>graft.</b> One cause is deficient healing between the aortic neck and the <b>stent</b> <b>graft.</b> We hypothesize that better healing, achieved by induction of vascular cell ingrowth into the graft material, results in better graft fixation. Previously we demonstrated ingrowth of neointima into the graft material if the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> is impregnated with a coat of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), heparin, and collagen. In this study we evaluated healing with bFGF-heparin-collagen–coated <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> in vivo. MethodsIn 4 pigs, 32 endovascular <b>stent</b> <b>grafts,</b> manufactured from standard Dacron and Gianturco Z-stents, were placed in the aorta. The <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> were impregnated with either bFGF-heparin containing collagen (n = 16) or control collagen (n = 16). After 4 and 8 weeks animals were killed, and ingrowth and healing of the <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> were macroscopically and electron microscopically evaluated. ResultsAfter 8 weeks all bFGF-impregnated <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> demonstrated ingrowth of tissue and healing between the graft and the aorta, whereas the control nonimpregnated <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> showed no ingrowth. Microscopic evaluation demonstrated α-smooth muscle actin–positive cells, most probably smooth muscle cells or myofibroblasts, growing from the vascular wall through the graft material. ConclusionA Dacron prosthesis impregnated with collagen, heparin, and bFGF induced graft healing in an in vivo pig model, in contrast to nonimpregnated <b>stent</b> <b>grafts.</b> This in vivo study confirms our previous findings in vitro. These results indicate that healing between Dacron and the aorta can be achieved, and suggest that type I endoleakage may be resolved by inducing healing between the aortic wall and the prosthesis with graft material containing growth factor...|$|R
40|$|Endovascular aortic {{replacement}} (EVAR) is {{an established}} technique, which uses <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> to treat aortic aneurysms in patients {{at risk of}} aneurysm rupture. Late <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> failure is a serious complication in endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms. Better understanding of the motion characteristics of <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> will be beneficial for designing future devices. In addition, analysis of <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> movement in individual patients in vivo can be valuable for predicting <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> failure in these patients. To be able to gather information on <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> motion in a quick and robust fashion, we propose an automatic method to segment <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> from CT data, consisting of three steps: the detection of seed points, finding the connections between these points to produce a graph, and graph processing to obtain the final geometric model {{in the form of}} an undirected graph. Using annotated reference data, the method was optimized and its accuracy was evaluated. The experiments were performed using data containing the AneuRx and Zenith <b>stent</b> <b>grafts.</b> The algorithm is robust for noise and small variations in the used parameter values, does not require much memory according to modern standards, and is fast enough to be used in a clinical setting (65 and 30 s for the two stent types, respectively). Further, it is shown that the resulting graphs have a 95 % (AneuRx) and 92 % (Zenith) correspondence with the annotated data. The geometric model produced by the algorithm allows incorporation of high level information and material properties. This enables us to study the in vivo motions and forces that act on the frame of the stent. We believe that such studies will provide new insights into the behavior of the <b>stent</b> <b>graft</b> in vivo, enables the detection and prediction of stent failure in individual patients, and can help in designing better <b>stent</b> <b>grafts</b> in the future...|$|R
