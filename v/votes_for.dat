With the threshold lowered from 60 <b>votes</b> <b>for</b> {{a constitutional amendment to}} 51 <b>votes</b> <b>for</b> a statute, the House of Representatives passed the expanded gambling bill, but the measure died in the Republican-dominated Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee by a 10â€“5 vote.
