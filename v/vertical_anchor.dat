40|$|A {{contracting}} consortium, {{comprising the}} Turkish contractor Asim-Alarko and the Dutch contractor Van Oord ACZ, has {{submitted to the}} Turkish Water Authority a new concept for an offshore fresh water pipeline between Turkey and Cyprus. Where conventional offshore pipelines are laid on the seabed and are made from steel, this new pipeline concept incorporates a submerged floating pipeline made from High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) which is anchored to the seabed by <b>vertical</b> <b>anchor</b> lines. This new concept could simplify the installation procedure of pipelines since the submerged floating pipeline will be anchored at a relatively limited depth below the sea level. This avoids the high forces resulting from installing a pipeline at great water depths and buckling due to external pressures. After previous feasibility studies the consortium requested Aker Kvaerner to perform detailed engineering for above-mentioned new pipeline concept. As {{a result of this}} the present study has been initiated to start with the global design of the concept, which has finally resulted in an extensive study of the following aspects: 9 ̆ 5 Study of the design parameters. 9 ̆ 5 Study of the hydraulics in the pipeline 9 ̆ 5 Study of the static behaviour of the proposed structure In the study of the design parameters it appears that especially some environmental data are difficult to quantify without doing an offshore survey; they are of great importance for the design. This concerns the marine growth at the relevant water depth, the magnitude and the direction of the deep-sea currents, the possible existence of internal waves and the soil properties. The properties of HDPE are also important for the design and therefore need accurate investigation, especially the stress-strain characteristics related to time and the creep behaviour of HDPE. Present material specifications appear to be not sufficient for final structural design. The pipeline must have the capacity to transport 75 million m 3 (2. 38 m 3 /s) of freshwater per year based on gravity flow. The hydraulic study showed that a pipeline with an internal diameter of 1. 48 [m] is needed. Wall-friction is the dominant cause of hydraulic losses in the pipeline. Friction losses owing to bends, valves, contractions and enlargements appear to be almost negligible. For further hydraulic design there are two aspects that need special attention. The first aspect is the possible occurrence of under-pressures near the coast of Cyprus during steady state flow in the pipeline. It is preferred to avoid these under-pressures; consequently, an adequate pressure control system will have to be designed. The second aspect, which needs extra attention, is surge. Closing operations of valves will initiate pressure waves. These pressure waves will have an important influence on the structural behaviour of the system. Investigation will be necessary to establish whether HDPE is able to withstand the related short-term loads or if a pressure release system is necessary. From the static analysis it appears that the configuration, as proposed by the contracting consortium, with a distance of 500 [m] between the <b>vertical</b> <b>anchor</b> lines should be technically feasible. However, local stress problems, which arise near the connection points of the <b>vertical</b> <b>anchor</b> lines, still have to be solved.

40|$|Limit {{analysis}} {{based upon}} the theory of plasticity {{is one of the}} very useful numerical techniques to determine the failure loads of different civil and mechanical engineering structures for a material following an associated flow rule. The limiting values of the collapse loads, namely, lower and upper bounds, can be bracketed quite accurately with the application of the lower and upper bound theorems of the limit analysis. With the advancement of the finite elements and different robust optimization techniques, the numerical limit analysis approach in association with finite elements is becoming very popular to assess the stability of various complicated structures. Although two different optimization methods, namely, linear programming and nonlinear programming, have been both successfully implemented by various researchers for solving different stability problems in geomechanics, the linear programming method is employed in the present thesis due to its inherent advantage in implementation and ease in achieving the convergence. The objectives of the present thesis are (i) to improve upon the existing lower bound limit analysis method, in combination with finite elements and linear programming, with an intention of reducing the computational time and the associated memory requirement, and (ii) to apply the existing lower bound finite element limit analysis to various important planar stability problems in geotechnical engineering. With reference to the first objective of the thesis, two new methods have been introduced in this thesis to improve upon the existing computational procedure while solving the geomechanics stability problem with the usage of the limit analysis, finite elements and linear programming. In the first method, namely, the method-I, the order of the yield polygon within the chosen domain is varied, based on the proximity of the stress state to the yield, such that a higher order polygon needs not to be used everywhere in the problem domain. In the second method, the method-II, it has been intended to use only a few selected sides, but not all, of the higher order yield polygon which are being used to linearize the Mohr-Coulomb yield function. The proposed two methods have been applied to compute the ultimate bearing capacity of smooth as well as rough strip footings for various soil frictional angles. It has been noticed that both the proposed new methods reduce the CPU time and the total number of inequality constraints required as compared to the existing lower bound linear programming method used in literature. With reference to the second objective, a few important planar stability problems in geomechanics associated with interference of footings and vertical anchors have been solved in the present thesis. Footings are essentially used to transfer the compressive loads of the super structures to underlying soil media. On the other hand, vertical anchors are used for generating passive supports to retaining walls, sheet piles and bulkheads. A large number of research investigations have been reported in literature to compute the collapse load for a single isolated strip footing and a single <b>vertical</b> <b>anchor.</b> It is a common practice to estimate the bearing capacity of footings or pullout capacity of anchors without considering the effect of interference. There are, however, clear evidences from the available literature that (i) the ultimate bearing capacity of footings, and (ii) the ultimate pullout capacity of anchors, are significantly affected by their interference effect. Based on different available methods, the interference of footings, in a group of two footings as well as an infinite number of multiple footings, has been examined by different researchers in order to compute the ultimate bearing capacity considering the group effect. However, there is no research study to find the ultimate bearing capacity of interfering footings with the usage of the lower bound limit analysis. In the present thesis, the ultimate bearing capacity of two and an infinite number of multiple strip footings placed on sandy soil with horizontal ground surface, has been determined. The analysis has been performed for smooth as well as rough footings. The failure loads for interfering footings are found to be always greater than the single isolated footing. The effect of the footings' interference is expressed in terms of an efficiency factor (ξγ); where, ξγ is defined as the ratio of the magnitude of failure load for a footing of width B in presence of the other footing to the magnitude of failure load of an isolated strip footing having the same width. The effect of the interference on the failure load (i) for rough footings becomes always greater than smooth footings, (ii) increases with an increase in soil frictional angle φ, and (iii) becomes almost negligible beyond the spacing, S > 3 B. It is observed that the failure load for a footing in a group of an infinite number of multiple strip footings becomes always greater than that for two interfering footings. Attempts have been made in this thesis to investigate the group effect of two vertical anchors on their horizontal pullout resistance (PuT). The anchors are considered to be embedded at a certain clear spacing (S) along the same vertical plane. The group effect has been studied separately for anchors embedded in (i) sandy soil, and (ii) undrained clay, respectively. For anchors embedded in clays, an increase of soil cohesion with depth, in a linear fashion, has also been taken into consideration. The magnitude of PuT has been obtained in terms of a group efficiency factor, ηγ for sand and ηc for clay, with respect to the failure load for a single isolated vertical plate with the same H/B. The pullout capacity of a group of two anchors either in sand or in undrained clay becomes quite extensive as compared to a single isolated anchor. The magnitudes of ηγ and ηc become maximum corresponding to a certain critical value of S/B, which has been found to lie generally between 0. 5 and 1. The value of ηγ for a given S/B has been found to become larger for greater values of H/B, φ, and δ. For greater values of H/B, the group effect becomes more significant in contributing the pullout resistance. The horizontal pullout capacity of a single isolated <b>vertical</b> <b>anchor</b> embedded in sand in the presence of pseudo static horizontal earthquake body forces has also been determined by using the lower bound finite element limit analysis. The variation of the pullout factor Fγ with changes in the embedment ratio of the smooth and rough anchor plates for different values of horizontal earthquake acceleration coefficient (αh) has been investigated. The analysis clearly reveals that the pullout resistance decreases quite significantly with an increase in the magnitude of the earthquake acceleration coefficient. For the various problems selected in the present thesis, the failure patterns have also been exclusively drawn {{in order to understand the}} development of the plastic zones within the chosen domain for solving a given problem. The results obtained from the analysis, for the various problems taken up in this thesis, have been thoroughly compared with those reported in literature...|$|E

The shape of the heave on the ground surface of a shallow anchor is similar to a normal distribution curve. The extended diameter of the heave was between 170 and 300 cm, which could be divided into two zones, primary and secondary, based on the failure mode of the ground. As the fixed length of a shallow anchor increased, the extended diameter also increased.

40|$|AbstractThe non-coaxial model {{simulating}} the non-coincidence {{between the}} principal stresses {{and the principal}} plastic strain rates is employed {{within the framework of}} finite element method (FEM) to predict the behaviors of anchors embedded in granular material. The non-coaxial model is developed based on the non-coaxial yield vertex theory, and the elastic and conventional coaxial plastic deformations are simulated by using elasto-perfectly plastic Drucker-Prager yield function according to the original yield vertex theory. Both the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>anchors</b> with various embedment depths are considered. Different anchor shapes and soil friction and dilation angles are also taken into account. The predictions indicate that the use of non-coaxial models leads to softer responses, compared with those using conventional coaxial models. Besides, the predicted ultimate pulling capacities are the same for both coaxial and non-coaxial models. The non-coaxial influences increase with the increasing embedment depths, and circular anchors lead to larger non-coaxial influences than strip anchors. In {{view of the fact that}} the design of anchors is mainly determined by their displacements, ignoring the non-coaxiality in finite element numerical analysis can lead to unsafe results...|$|R

A typical mature tree 30-50 m tall has a root system that extends horizontally in all directions as far as the tree is tall or more, but well over 95% of the roots are in the top 50 cm depth of soil.|$|R

The occurrence and {{the development}} mechanism of one small slide at a tailing pond slope at the Taihang mountain is analysed with the comprehensive exploration methods such as engineering geophysical prospecting and geological prospecting etc. It is brought forward that the small slide is a shallow layer crushed stone slide {{with the type of}} drawing – enlarging outside. The <b>vertical</b> prestressed <b>anchor</b> retaining earth wall is applied for correcting the slide with the economical and feasible correction principle. This method depends on the vertical prestressed force, pressed on the earth wall body which is made by the anchor in the foundation, to balance the sliding force of the slide mass. This method reaches the purpose of decreasing the masonry and the engineering price. The design thinking of the <b>vertical</b> prestressed <b>anchor</b> retaining earth wall is analyzed in details the construction technology and technique essentials is introduced in this paper. The efficiency of the method is indicated by its well correction result. This technique can offer reference for the similar geological disaster correction...|$|R

40|$|The {{horizontal}} pullout {{capacity of}} a group of two <b>vertical</b> strip <b>anchors</b> placed along the same vertical plane in sand has been determined by using the upper bound finite elements limit analysis. The variation of the efficiency factor (xi (gamma)) with changes in clear spacing (S) between the anchors has been established to evaluate the total group failure load for different values of (i) embedment ratio (H/B), (ii) soil internal friction angle (phi), and (iii) anchor-soil interface friction angle (delta). The total group failure load, for a given H/B, becomes always maximum corresponding to a certain optimal spacing (S-opt). The value of S-opt/B was found to lie in a range of 0. 5 - 1. 4. The maximum magnitude of xi (gamma) increases generally with increases in H/B, phi and delta...|$|R

The analysis has been done rigorously by using the method of stress characteristics. The results have been expressed {{in the form of}} non-dimensional charts. The pullout resistance has been found to reduce quite extensively with increase in the magnitude of horizontal earthquake acceleration. The results were compared with the previously published data, and it was seen that the computed pullout resistance with the proposed method was found to be lowest...|$|R

The detector will consist of 12 <b>vertical</b> strings <b>anchored</b> at the sea bottom, each supporting 25 triplets of optical modules equipped with photomultipliers, yielding sensitivity to neutrinos with energies above some 10 GeV. The effective detector area is roughly 0. 1 square kilometres for neutrino energies exceeding 10 TeV. The measurement of the Cherenkov light emitted by muons produced in muon-neutrino charged-current interactions in water and under-sea rock will permit the reconstruction of the neutrino direction with an accuracy of better than 0. 3 degrees at high energies. ANTARES will complement the field of view of neutrino telescopes at the South Pole in the low-background searches for point-sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos and will also be sensitive to neutrinos produced by WIMP annihilation in the Sun or the Galactic centre.
