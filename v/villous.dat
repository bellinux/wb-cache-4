5|$|On July 12, 1985, President Ronald Reagan {{underwent}} a colonoscopy, during which a <b>villous</b> adenoma (a pre-cancerous lesion) was discovered. When told by his physician (Dr. Edward Cattau) {{that he could}} undergo surgery immediately or {{in two to three}} weeks, Reagan elected to have it removed immediately.|$|E
25|$|A <b>villous</b> broad leafed {{plant with}} a single hollow stem and favoring mud flats like Marsh Groundsel (Senecio hydrophilus) but not alike in that marsh ragwort cannot {{tolerate}} alkaline sites nor standing water.|$|E
25|$|Three {{types of}} leaves with differing {{morphology}} are present: cauline leaves, or those that {{appear on the}} stem {{from the middle of}} the plant upwards; basal leaves, or those that are present at the base of the plant; and distal leaves, which are those found on the extremities of the plant. All types are thin and sharply serrated with 6 to 15 pointed teeth per side. They are ciliate, meaning they have small hairy projections emerging from the margins of the leaf, while the apices, or tips of the leaves, are acuminate, meaning they taper to a point. The adaxial (i.e. upper) surfaces of the leaves are nearly hairless or sparsely hairy, while the abaxial (i.e. lower) surfaces are sparsely hairy with the veins being more <b>villous,</b> or covered in shaggy hairs.|$|E
25|$|Prenatal {{and other}} {{diagnostic}} techniques such as immunocytochemistry (ICC) evaluation are usually followed by FISH or Polymerase Chain Reaction to detect chromosomal aneuploidies. Maternal blood sampling for fetal cells, often used to identify risk of trisomies 18 or 21, poses less risk as compared to amniocentesis and chorionic <b>villous</b> sampling (CVS). Chorionic villus sampling utilizes placental tissue to give information about fetal chromosome status and has been used since the 1970s. In addition to CVS, amniocentesis {{can be used to}} obtain fetal karyotype by examining fetal cells in amniotic fluid. It was first performed in 1952 and became standard practice in the 1970s. The odds of having a child with polysomy increases as the age of the mother increases, so pregnant women over the age of 35 are tested.|$|E
500|$|Nepenthes × kinabaluensis {{is another}} {{impressive}} plant. The pitchers get large also, {{but do not}} compare to those of N. rajah or N. × alisaputrana. It is a well-known natural hybrid of what many {{consider to be the}} two most spectacular Nepenthes species of Borneo: N. rajah and N. villosa. Nepenthes × kinabaluensis is only found on Mount Kinabalu (hence the name) and nearby Mount Tambuyukon, where the two parent species are occur sympatrically. More specifically, plants are known from a footpath near Paka Cave and several places along an unestablished route on a south-east ridge, which lies {{on the west side of}} the Upper Kolopis River. The only accessible location from which this hybrid is known is the Kinabalu summit trail, between Layang-Layang and the helipad, where it grows at about 2900m in a clearing dominated by Dacrydium gibbsiae and Leptospermum recurvum trees. [...] Nepenthes × kinabaluensis has an altitudinal distribution of 2420 to 3030m. It grows in open areas in cloud forest. This hybrid can be distinguished from N. rajah by the presence of raised ribs that line the inner edge of the peristome and end with elongated teeth. [...] These are more prominent than those found in N. rajah and are clue as to the hybrid's parentage (N. villosa has highly developed peristome ribs). The peristome is coarse and expanded at the margin (but not scalloped like that of N. rajah), the lid orbiculate or reniformed and almost flat. In general, pitchers are larger than those of N. villosa and the tendril joins the apex about 1–2cm below the leaf tip, a feature which is characteristic of N. rajah. In older plants, the tendril can be almost woody. [...] Nepenthes × kinabaluensis has an indumentum of <b>villous</b> hairs covering the pitchers and leaf margins, which is approximately intermediate between the parents. Lower pitchers have two fringed wings, whereas the upper pitchers usually lack these. The colour of the pitcher varies from yellow to scarlet. Nepenthes × kinabaluensis seems to produce upper pitchers more readily than either of its parents. [...] In all respects N. × kinabaluensis is intermediate between the two parent species and it is easy to distinguish from all other Nepenthes of Borneo. However, it has been confused once before, when the hybrid was labelled as N. rajah in Letts Guide to Carnivorous Plants of the World (Cheers, 1992).|$|E

2500|$|... {{standing}} 6 to 60inches (15 to 150cm) tall, S. congestus varies as much {{in stature}} {{as it does in}} the distribution and the persistence of its tomentum (the closely matted or fine hairs on plant leaves). Sparse to dense <b>villous</b> stems are more hollow towards the base; hairs that are white, light yellowish, or reddish brown. Basal and cauline leaf edges mostly toothless or with a few coarse teeth that sometimes wither before flowering. The leaves all basically similar in shape, oblong with the lower ones often spatulate, 1.6 to 8inches (4 to 20cm) long, 0.2 to 2.5 in (0.5 to 6cm) wide, with the basal leaves occasionally larger, glabrous or <b>villous</b> in patches, rounded at the tips, toothed, often deciduous with clasping bases.|$|E
2500|$|Coeliac {{disease is}} a common form of malabsorption, {{affecting}} up to 1% of people of northern European descent.
