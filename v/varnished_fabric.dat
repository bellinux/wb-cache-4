5|$|This {{same general}} {{area of the}} {{property}} was used also for the drying of the <b>varnished</b> <b>fabric.</b> This consisted of twenty foot high clothes line-type poles that were 100 feet apart and further protected by wind-break fences of canvas. Between the poles were strung wires for laying the wet <b>varnished</b> <b>fabric</b> onto for drying. After drying the fabric was then rewound onto rollers and varnished {{over and over again}} several more times to each side and thoroughly dried each time. Each application of new varnish added a thin layer.|$|E
500|$|Carl Edgar Myers ( [...] – [...] ) was an American businessman, scientist, inventor, meteorologist, balloonist, and {{aeronautical}} engineer. He invented {{many types}} of hydrogen balloon airships and related equipment. His business of making passenger airshipballoons and instrument balloons at his [...] "balloon farm" [...] was well known throughout the United States {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries. He invented a machine for <b>varnishing</b> <b>fabric</b> that would make it impervious to hydrogen so that the finished product could be made into large envelopes for lighter-than-air balloons.|$|R
50|$|With its {{geodetic}} aluminium skeleton airframe construction {{covered by}} a <b>varnished</b> linen <b>fabric</b> skin it {{was said to be}} held in great regard by aircrews and pilots for its durability and resistance to damage, able to survive long enough to return home, even if one engine failed.|$|R
50|$|During the 1920s they diversified into {{paint and}} <b>varnish,</b> coated <b>fabrics</b> and {{plastics}} and changed their name in 1927 to Canadian Explosives Ltd. (CEL). In 1928 they re-opened the Nobel plants and acquired the Dominion Cartridge Company. In 1929 CEL {{merged with the}} Canadian Salt Co. Ltd. (CSXX), Grasselli Chemical Co. Ltd. (Grasselli), and Mond Nickel Co. (MNX) and changed their name to Canadian Industries Ltd.|$|R
5000|$|... 4,4’-Oxydianiline {{is used in}} the {{production}} {{of a wide variety of}} polymer resins. The primary use lies in {{the production}} of polyimide and poly(ester)imide resins. These resins are used for their temperature-resistant properties and are utilized in products including wire enamels, coatings, film, adhesives, insulating <b>varnishes,</b> coated <b>fabrics,</b> flame-retardant fibers, oil sealants and retainers, insulation for cables and printed circuits, and laminates and composite for aerospace vehicles.|$|R
500|$|Myers {{built his}} first balloon {{in the summer}} of [...] 1878 in Mohawk Valley. It was over [...] in {{diameter}} and could contain 10,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas. The balloon material with its valve weighed almost one hundred pounds. The envelope material was high quality cotton cloth that was unbleached. It was varnished with linseed oil gum thinned with turpentine. Myers invented machinery that applied the coats of <b>varnish</b> onto <b>fabric</b> of silk or cotton. There were several coats of varnish applied to make a balloon envelope impervious to hydrogen. The first of these patented machines, that took fourteen days to construct, was in operation for seven years. Myers made sixty hydrogen balloons in sixty days in 1891. He built a set of ten hydrogen gas balloons in five days in 1892.|$|R
50|$|German {{aircraft}} {{left the}} factory {{in a standard}} finish, although this differed from one manufacturer to another. Clear <b>varnish</b> on <b>fabric</b> and wooden surfaces had changed by 1916 to various camouflage schemes. In the Jagdstaffeln this {{gave way to a}} riot of colour, as pilots repainted their machines as they pleased. In January 1917, when he took over Jasta 11, Richthofen celebrated by painting his Albatros red and the squadron followed suit, painting at least part of their machines red. Other Jagdstaffeln soon adopted the fashion until few fighters flew in the manufacturers' finish, their fuselages in particular at least sporting the pilot's monogram or perhaps his favourite colour(s), even if the wings (as was often the case) remained in camouflage. A squadron theme was sometimes followed, with machines decorated in similar colours or with similar motifs but generally personal preference seems to have been prevalent. More than one pilot (on both sides) recorded that the contrast with the plain khaki of RFC fighters was helpful in rapidly distinguishing friend from foe in the hurly-burly of a dogfight and might have aided the accreditation of air victories claimed by individual German pilots.|$|R
5|$|Permission {{was granted}} for flight testing {{to begin in}} April 1935, and Bajdak {{conducted}} his first flight in the prototype on 22 April 1935. For this initial uneventful flight, no weapons were installed and a light fuel load was used. The following day, Bajdak put the IK-1 into unplanned aerobatic manoeuvres, after which the wing fabric was observed as being slack. An official from Ikarus checked it and stated that this would resolve once the <b>fabric</b> <b>varnish</b> had completely dried. Bajdak took the aircraft for a third test flight the next day, which involved more unplanned aerobatics. When the aircraft was at , Bajdak {{put it into a}} shallow dive and pulled up abruptly at high speed, at which point the wing fabric began to tear rapidly, {{to the extent that it}} could be seen from the ground. The aircraft dropped into a spin to starboard, and Bajdak baled out safely while the IK-1 crashed into the ground.|$|R
