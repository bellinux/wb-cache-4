5|$|Allingham {{was born}} in 1896 in Clapton, County of London. When he was 14 months old, his father, Henry Thomas Allingham (1870-1899), died at age 29 of tuberculosis. Henry is {{recorded}} in the 1901 census with his widowed mother Amy Jane Allingham (née Foster) (1873-1915), a laundress forewoman, living {{with her parents and}} brother at 23 Verulam Avenue, Walthamstow. His mother remarried in 1905 to Hubert George Higgs and in 1907 the family moved to Clapham, London. Henry and his mother are recorded in the 1911 Census living at 21 Heyford Avenue, Lambeth, while his stepfather was lodging away from home working as a wheelwright. Henry attended a London County Council school before attending the Regent Street Polytechnic. Allingham remembered seeing the City Imperial Volunteers return from the Second Boer War, and also recalled watching W. G. Grace play cricket. On leaving school, Allingham started work as a trainee surgical instrument maker at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. He did not find this job <b>very</b> <b>interesting,</b> <b>and</b> so left to work for a coachbuilder specialising in car bodies.|$|E
25|$|In this fourth Edition I {{have made}} no {{alterations}} of any kind. I now, however, find myself at liberty to acknowledge my very great obligations to Mr. HENRY HOP of Amsterdam. To that Gentleman I owe the most distinct, as well as liberal information, concerning a <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> important subject, the Bank of Amsterdam; of which no printed account had ever appeared to me satisfactory, or even intelligible. The name of that Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from him must do so much honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my vanity is so much interested in making this acknowledgment, that I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to this new Edition of my Book.|$|E

500|$|Within {{the above}} {{framework}} physicists were then able to calculate {{to a high}} degree of accuracy some of the properties of electrons, such as the anomalous magnetic dipole moment. However, as Feynman points out, it fails totally to explain why particles such as the electron have the masses they do. [...] "There is no theory that adequately explains these numbers. We use the numbers in all our theories, but we don't understand them – what they are, or where they come from. I believe that from a fundamental point of view, this is a <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> serious problem." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2006 {{interview}} with CNN-IBN, Madhur Bhandarkar {{said that he}} was preparing to make a film about the fashion industry; he thought the lack of Indian films on this subject prompted him to do so. He said he was fascinated with the industry, the models and their lives outside the ramp walks, saying [...] "I was amazed at the overwhelming attention given to the fashion Industry by the media and the public. I thought the idea of delving deep into the fashion world was <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> intriguing."

500|$|Chamberlin was a Mormon, {{an active}} member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He {{believed}} {{that there should be no}} animosity between religion and science. Stake President George W. McCune described a 1922 meeting in which Chamberlin testified [...] "to the effect that all his labors and researches in the laboratories of science, while <b>very</b> <b>interesting,</b> <b>and</b> to a great extent satisfying to the intellect, did not satisfy the soul of man, and that he yearned for something more," [...] adding Chamberlin [...] "bore testimony that he knew that ours is the true Church of Jesus Christ." [...] University of Oregon doctoral student Tim S. Reid called Chamberlin clearly devout, however, Sterling McMurrin stated [...] "spiders are different from metaphysics, and I think Ralph was not such a devout Mormon." ...|$|E

Critical reaction to the prologue was positive, with one critic commenting that [...] "no one gets {{to make a film}} on this kind of scale anymore. Except for Christopher Nolan," [...] though a round-up of reviews highlighted the way many critics found Tom Hardy's dialogue very difficult to hear. Addressing the issue in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Nolan said [...] "I think when people see the film, things will come into focus. Bane is very complex and <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> when people see the finished film people will be very entertained by him." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{some critics}} {{appreciated}} how Fringe chose {{to end the}} finale with {{a shot of the}} World Trade Center, others disliked it. Jeff Pinkner defended their decision by explaining they chose it because the building is [...] "obviously very iconic" [...] and it best displayed that in the parallel universe, [...] "things are both better and in some ways worse. It's just different choices, the road not taken". Leonard Nimoy also defended the writers, commenting that when he received the script, he thought it [...] "was <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> really kind of daring contemporary television to pull in that story... You know, it's not easy to use that kind of stuff without seeming somehow exploitive. But I thought they did it very, very well". Many critics expressed that because of the episode, they couldn't wait for the following season to begin. IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9.2/10, while website blogger io9 listed [...] "There's More Than One of Everything" [...] as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show.|$|E

Currently he's more into Buddhism, or more specifically, Buddha himself. Ever since he was little he was curious about occult subjects. While in Elementary School, he became obsessed with the ancient civilizations of Egypt, the Maya's Easter Islands and the Inca.

2500|$|In 2011 several {{previously}} unpublished {{letters from}} Hughes to Craig Raine {{were published in}} the literary review Areté. They relate mainly to the process of editing Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being, and also contain a sequence of drafts of letters in which Raine attempts to explain to Hughes his disinclination to publish Hughes's poem The Cast in an anthology he was editing, {{on the grounds that it}} might open Hughes to further attack on the subject of Sylvia Plath. [...] "Dear Ted, Thanks for the poem. It is <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> would cause a minor sensation" [...] (4 April 1997). The poem was eventually published in Birthday Letters and Hughes makes a passing reference to this then unpublished collection: [...] "I have a whole pile of pieces that are all – one way or another – little bombs for the studious and earnest to throw at me" [...] (5 April 1997).|$|E
2500|$|Douglas Jerrold's Weekly Newspaper wrote [...] "Wuthering Heights is {{a strange}} sort of book,—baffling all regular criticism; yet, it is {{impossible}} to begin and not finish it; and quite as impossible to lay it aside afterwards and say nothing about. In Wuthering Heights the reader is shocked, disgusted, almost sickened by details of cruelty, inhumanity, and the most diabolical hate and vengeance, and anon come passages of powerful testimony to the supreme power of love– even over demons in the human form. The women in the book are of a strange fiendish-angelic nature, tantalising, and terrible, and the men are indescribable out of the book itself. Yet, towards the close of the story occurs the following pretty, soft picture, which comes like the rainbow after a storm... We strongly recommend all our readers who love novelty to get this story, for we can promise them that they never have read anything like it before. It is very puzzling and <b>very</b> <b>interesting,</b> <b>and</b> if we had space we would willingly devote a little more time to the analysis of this remarkable story, but we must leave it to our readers to decide what sort of book it is." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1819, Peacock was unexpectedly summoned to London {{for a period of}} probation with the East India Company who needed to reinforce their staff with talented people. They summoned to their service in the Examiner's office James Mill and three others. Peacock was included at the recommendation of Peter Auber, the company historian, whom he had known at school, though probably not as a school-fellow. Peacock's test papers earned the high commendation, [...] "Nothing superfluous and nothing wanting." [...] On 13 January 1819, he wrote from 5 York Street, Covent Garden: [...] "I now pass every morning at the India House, from half-past 10 to half-past 4, studying Indian affairs. My object is not yet attained, though I have little doubt but that it will be. It was not in the first instance of my own seeking, but was proposed to me. It will lead to a very sufficing provision for me in two or three years. It is not in the common routine of office, but is an employment of a <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> intellectual kind, connected with finance and legislation, in which it is possible to be of great service, not only to the Company, but to the millions under their dominion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unferth {{is portrayed}} by John Malkovich. Malkovich became {{involved}} in the project because one of his friends, who had worked with Zemeckis, [...] "spoke very highly of him. I had always found him a <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>and</b> innovative filmmaker. I liked the script very much and I liked the group involved and the process interested me a great deal also." [...] He found the experience of working with motion capture to be similar to his experiences working in the theater. He also found the process intriguing: [...] "Say you do a normal day of filmmaking. Sometimes that’s 1/8 of a page, sometimes it’s 3/8th of a page, normally let’s say it’s 2½ pages, maybe 3. Now it’s probably a little more {{than it used to be}} but not always. So you may be acting for a total of 20 minutes a day. In this, you act the entire day all the time except for the tiny amount of time it takes them to sort of coordinate the computer information, let’s say, and make sure that the computers are reading the data and that you’re transmitting the data. It interests me on that level because I’m a professional actor so I’d just as soon act as sit around." [...] Malkovich also recalled that he studied the original poem in high school, and that “I think we got smacked if we couldn’t recite a certain number of stanzas. It was in the Old English class and I think my rendition was exemplary." ...|$|E
