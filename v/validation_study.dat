The number of age <b>validation</b> <b>studies</b> has increased over the last 30 years following previous calls for more research; however, few species have validated structures spanning all life stages. In addition, few fishes of conservation concern have validated ageing structures. A prioritization framework, using a combination of eight characteristics, is offered to direct future age <b>validation</b> <b>studies</b> and close the validation information gap. Additional study, using the offered prioritization framework, and increased availability of published studies that incorporate uncertainty when presenting research results dealing with age information are needed...|$|R

2500|$|The Duttweiler (1984) Internal Control Index (ICI) {{addresses}} perceived [...] {{problems with}} the Rotter scales, including their forced-choice format, susceptibility to social desirability and heterogeneity (as indicated by [...] factor analysis). She also notes that, while other scales existed in 1984 to measure locus of control, [...] "they appear {{to be subject to}} many of the same problems". Unlike the forced-choice format used on Rotter's scale, Duttweiler's 28-item ICI uses a Likert-type scale in which people must state whether they would rarely, occasionally, sometimes, frequently or usually behave as specified in each of 28 statements. The ICI assess variables pertinent to internal locus: cognitive processing, autonomy, resistance to social influence, self-confidence and delay of gratification. A small (133 student-subject) <b>validation</b> <b>study</b> indicated that the scale had good internal reliability (a Cronbach's alpha of 0.85).|$|E
2500|$|The {{accuracy}} of the two-factor model was challenged by studies that suggested a third factor (interactional justice) may be involved. [...] Bies and Moag (1986) argue that interactional justice is distinct from procedural justice because it represents the social exchange component of the interaction {{and the quality of}} treatment whereas procedural justice represents the processes that were used to arrive at the decision outcomes. [...] Generally researchers are in agreement regarding the distinction between procedural and distributive justice but there is more controversy over the distinction between interactional and procedural justice (Cohen-Charash & Spector, 2001). [...] Colquitt (2001) demonstrated that a four-factor model (including procedural, distributive, interpersonal, and informational justice) fit the data significantly better than a two or three factor model. [...] Colquitt's construct <b>validation</b> <b>study</b> also showed that each of the four components have predictive validity for different key organizational outcomes (e.g., commitment and rule compliance).|$|E

30|$|<b>Validation</b> <b>studies</b> on {{placement}} tests (e.g., Wall et al. 1994) {{have been}} done using the traditional concept of test validity. The concept has drastically evolved in a few decades. Along with the change, {{one of the most}} prominent validity frameworks called an argument-based validity framework has been proposed (e.g., Bachman & Palmer 2010; Chapelle 2008; Kane 2006). Some <b>validation</b> <b>studies</b> for high-stakes tests such as the TOEFL® have been conducted using the framework (e.g., Chapelle et al. 2010) but almost none has been done on placement tests. It is test-developers’ responsibility to publicize results obtained from <b>validation</b> <b>studies</b> in order to avoid users’ misuse of the tests.

40|$|This {{literature}} review {{is part of}} the "Driver performance in the EPSRC driving simulator: a validation study" project funded by EPSRC. It focuses mainly on driving simulator <b>validation</b> <b>studies</b> with regard to driver behaviour. Various approaches, methodologies and criteria have been proposed until today regarding the behavioral and physical validation of a driving simulator. At the same time, a number of behavioural <b>validation</b> <b>studies</b> have been conducted, with or without taking into account the proposed validation approaches. The author considered necessary this {{literature review}} because according to her knowledge there was no other published review which examined thoroughly the link between theory (proposed validation approaches and methodologies) and practice (<b>validation</b> <b>studies</b> cc driving simulators). Most of the recent behaviour <b>validation</b> <b>studies</b> have been focused on the absolute and relative validity of the simulator without taking into consideration the issue of the face validity. The format of this paper will be as follows. A small introduction to driving simulators and their usefulness will be presented first followed by the necessity of validating them. The existing validation approaches, methodologies and criteria will be analysed and earlier and recent behaviour <b>validation</b> <b>studies</b> will be reviewed and compared in detail. These studies will be classified according to the driver behaviour levels and driving performance (as they will be defined) and then will be assessed according to the validation criteria. Emphasis will be given to the interpretation of the findings from these comparisons, and in particular to their applicability in real road traffic situations...|$|R

30|$|As {{validation}} is an {{iterative process}} to accumulate validity evidence {{in order to}} make a convincing validity argument (e.g., Chapelle et al. 2008), more <b>validation</b> <b>studies</b> need to be conducted.

First, it should be noted that all <b>validation</b> <b>studies</b> on the TEAP test we reviewed were conducted by researchers at the CRELLA or Eiken Foundation of Japan, namely, by collaborators on or developers of the TEAP test, respectively, and may therefore lack external validity. As the TEAP test was only introduced in 2014, it is understandable but not excusable that all studies were conducted by those associated with its design. Unfortunately, we have not been able to locate <b>validation</b> <b>studies</b> on the TEAP test that were conducted by external researchers. The TEAP developer is aware of this, which is why they commissioned the first and second authors of the current manuscript—external researchers—to conduct this study.|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{availability}} of high-quality, validated food frequency questionnaires {{is useful for}} the conduct of robust population dietary iron-related research. This review aimed to evaluate the validation quality of recently validated food frequency questionnaires that measure iron intakes in Australian or New Zealand adults. Methods: Articles validating food frequency questionnaires that measured iron intakes in Australian or New Zealand adults, published from 1995, were sourced from a range of databases using standard search terms. Eligible <b>validation</b> <b>studies</b> were assessed for validation quality using recommendations from international reviews of food frequency questionnaire <b>validation</b> <b>studies,</b> and a quality score was calculated. Results: Nine studies validating food frequency questionnaires were located. Seven of the nine studies had achieved at least an acceptable quality validation score. More than half of the international validation recommendations were met in {{at least half of the}} eligible studies. Studies generally did not report or consider nutrient supplementation, did not validate the food frequency questionnaire against a biomarker, nor measured survey repeatability. Conclusions: The majority of food frequency questionnaire <b>validation</b> <b>studies</b> had achieved at least an acceptable quality validation score; however, some food frequency questionnaires had undergone a higher quality validation process than others. Applying the international validation recommendations to future <b>validation</b> <b>studies</b> may improve the quality of the food frequency questionnaire validation process and, potentially, population dietary iron-related research.
