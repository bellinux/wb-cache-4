50|$|<b>Vipera</b> <b>latifii</b> is a venomous viper species {{endemic to}} Iran. No {{subspecies}} are currently recognized.|$|E
50|$|Lots of marsh frogs (Rana ridibunda) live in Lar riversides. Meadow viper (Vipera ursinii), blunt-nosed viper (Macrovipera lebetina), Iranian valley viper (<b>Vipera</b> <b>latifii)</b> and Caucasian agama (Laudakia caucasia) {{are among}} the {{reptiles}} of this mountainous region.|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} an extensive study of neutralization of lethality of 11 species and one subspecies of snakes {{of the genus}} Vipera, and of five species of Macrovipera, by two experimental equine antisera. One antiserum was a trivalent preparation raised against the venoms of Vipera aspis aspis, Vipera berus berus and Vipera ammodytes ammodytes; {{the other was a}} pentavalent preparation that also included venoms of Vipera (now Montivipera) xanthina and Macrovipera lebetina obtusa. We measured specific neutralization of lethality against all venoms included in the immunization schemes, and paraspecific neutralization against the venoms of Vipera ammodytes montandoni, Vipera (Montivipera) bornmuelleri, Vipera latastei, <b>Vipera</b> (Mo.) <b>latifii,</b> <b>Vipera</b> (Mo.) lotievi, Vipera (Daboia) palaestinae, Vipera (Mo.) raddei and Vipera seoanei, as well as against Macrovipera (D.) desert, Macrovipera lebetina cernovi, Macrovipera lebetina turanica and Macrovipera schweitzeri. We found an important degree of paraspecific protection within each genera (omitting recent reclassification) that was quite independent of both the lethal potency of the venoms and their geographic origin. This information may be of use to clinicians charged with the treatment of Vipera or Macrovipera envenomations with non-specific antivenoms...|$|R
