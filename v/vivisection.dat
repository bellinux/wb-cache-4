5|$|Bayliss and Starling {{had also}} used <b>vivisection</b> on anaesthetized dogs to {{discover}} peristalsis in 1899. They {{went on to}} discover {{a variety of other}} important physiological phenomena and principles, many of which were based on their experimental work involving animal <b>vivisection.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{appointed the}} Second Royal Commission on <b>Vivisection</b> on 17 September 1906. It heard evidence from scientists and anti-vivisection groups; Ernest Starling addressed the commission {{for three days}} in December 1906.|$|E
5|$|There was {{significant}} opposition to <b>vivisection</b> in England, {{in both houses}} of parliament, during the reign of Queen Victoria (1837–1901); the Queen herself strongly opposed it. The term <b>vivisection</b> referred to the dissection of living animals, with and without anaesthesia, often in front of audiences of medical students. In 1875 there were around 300 experiments on animals in the UK, a figure that had risen to 19,084 in 1903 when the brown dog was vivisected, and 4.11 million in 2012, 4,643 of them on dogs.|$|E

5|$|Details of {{the speech}} were {{published}} the next day by the radical Daily News (founded in 1846 by Charles Dickens), and questions were raised in the House of Commons, particularly by Sir Frederick Banbury, a Conservative MP and sponsor of a bill aimed at ending <b>vivisection</b> demonstrations. Bayliss demanded a public apology, and when by 12 May it had failed to materialize he issued a writ for libel.|$|E
5|$|In December 1903 Mark Twain, {{who opposed}} <b>vivisection,</b> {{published}} a short story, A Dog's Tale, in Harper's, written {{from the point}} of view of a dog whose puppy is experimented on and killed. Given the timing and Twain's views, the story may have been inspired by the libel trial, according to Mark Twain scholar Shelley Fisher Fishkin. Coleridge ordered 3,000 copies of A Dog's Tale, which were specially printed for him by Harper's.|$|E
5|$|Nazi {{society had}} {{elements}} supportive of animal rights {{and many people}} were fond of zoos and wildlife. The government took several measures to ensure the protection of animals and the environment. In 1933, the Nazis enacted a stringent animal-protection law that affected what was allowed for medical research. However, the law was only loosely enforced {{and in spite of}} a ban on <b>vivisection</b> the Ministry of the Interior readily handed out permits for experiments on animals.|$|E

5|$|The Brown Dog {{affair was}} a {{political}} controversy about <b>vivisection</b> that raged in England from 1903 until 1910. It involved the infiltration by Swedish feminists of University of London medical lectures, pitched battles between medical students and the police, police protection for the statue of a dog, a libel trial at the Royal Courts of Justice, {{and the establishment of}} a Royal Commission to investigate the use of animals in experiments. The affair became a cause célèbre that divided the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{anatomy of}} the muscles and {{skeleton}} is described in the Hippocratic Corpus, an Ancient Greek medical work written by unknown authors. Aristotle described vertebrate anatomy based on animal dissection. Praxagoras identified the difference between arteries and veins. Also in the 4th century BCE, Herophilos and Erasistratus produced more accurate anatomical descriptions based on <b>vivisection</b> of criminals in Alexandria during the Ptolemaic dynasty.|$|E
5|$|In the 2nd century, Galen of Pergamum, an anatomist, clinician, {{writer and}} philosopher, wrote the final and highly {{influential}} anatomy treatise of ancient times. He compiled existing knowledge and studied anatomy through dissection of animals. He {{was one of}} the first experimental physiologists through his <b>vivisection</b> experiments on animals. Galen's drawings, based mostly on dog anatomy, became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years. His work was known to Renaissance doctors only through Islamic Golden Age medicine until it was translated from the Greek some time in the 15th century.|$|E
50|$|An {{anonymous}} researcher, {{who claims}} he was attached to Unit 1644, says that it regularly carried out human <b>vivisections</b> as well as infecting humans with cholera, typhus, and bubonic plague.

He was held in detention in China for many years, finally being released in 1965.|$|R
50|$|She {{believed}} that the Christian morality ought to play as large a role as scientific inquiry in medicine and that medical schools ought to instruct students in this basic truth. She also was antimaterialist and {{did not believe in}} <b>vivisections,</b> inoculation, vaccines or germ theory, instead subscribing to more spiritual healing methods. She {{believed that}} disease came from moral impurity, not from microbes.|$|R
5|$|Opposition {{to the use}} {{of animals}} in medical {{research}} first arose in the United States during the 1860s, when Henry Bergh founded the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), with America's first specifically anti-vivisection organization being the American AntiVivisection Society (AAVS), founded in 1883. Antivivisectionists of the era generally believed the spread of mercy was the great cause of civilization, and <b>vivisection</b> was cruel. However, in the USA the antivivisectionists' efforts were defeated in every legislature, overwhelmed by the superior organization and influence of the medical community. Overall, this movement had little legislative success until the passing of the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Physiologists such as Claude Bernard {{explored}} (through <b>vivisection</b> {{and other}} experimental methods) {{the chemical and}} physical functions of living bodies to an unprecedented degree, {{laying the groundwork for}} endocrinology (a field that developed quickly after the discovery of the first hormone, secretin, in 1902), biomechanics, and the study of nutrition and digestion. The importance and diversity of experimental physiology methods, within both medicine and biology, grew dramatically over {{the second half of the}} 19th century. The control and manipulation of life processes became a central concern, and experiment was placed at the center of biological education.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} {{was triggered}} by allegations that, in February 1903, William Bayliss of the Department of Physiology at University College London performed an illegal <b>vivisection,</b> before an audience of 60 medical students, on a brown terrier dog—adequately anaesthetized, according to Bayliss and his team; conscious and struggling, according to the Swedish activists. The procedure was condemned as cruel and unlawful by the National Anti-Vivisection Society. Bayliss, whose research on dogs led {{to the discovery of}} hormones, was outraged by the assault on his reputation. He sued for libel and won.|$|E
50|$|The Imperial Japanese Navy medic Akira Makino {{revealed}} {{that while he}} was stationed on Mindanao at Zamboanga from December 1944 to February 1945, he and other Japanese troops in his unit killed Moro Muslim prisoners by beheading or performed <b>vivisections</b> on them, cutting them open while they were alive to study their internal organs, and the Japanese also forced the Moros to dig their own graves.|$|R
50|$|In early 1942, {{prisoners at}} Dachau {{were used by}} Rascher in {{experiments}} to perfect ejection seats at high altitudes. A low-pressure chamber containing these prisoners was used to simulate conditions at altitudes of up to 20,000 m (66,000 ft). It was rumoured that Rascher performed <b>vivisections</b> on the brains of victims who survived the initial experiment. Of the 200 subjects, 80 died outright, {{and the others were}} executed.|$|R
50|$|A few {{scholars}} in the Hellenistic period under the Ptolemies—particularly Herophilus of Chalcedon and Erasistratus of Chios—amended Aristotle's physiological work, even performing experimental dissections and <b>vivisections.</b> Claudius Galen became the most important authority on medicine and anatomy. Though a few ancient atomists such as Lucretius challenged the teleological Aristotelian viewpoint that all aspects of life {{are the result of}} design or purpose, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, natural theology) remained central to biological thought until the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|R
5|$|Of the {{approximately}} 545 Allied airmen who were {{captured in the}} Japanese home islands (excluding the Kuril and Bonin Islands), 132 were executed and 29 were killed by civilians. Another 94 airmen died from other causes while in Japanese custody, including 52 who were killed when they were deliberately left in a prison in Tokyo during the 25/26May raid on the city. Between six and eight US airmen shot down on 5May were subjected to <b>vivisection</b> at the Kyushu Imperial University; Professor Fukujirō Ishiyama and other doctors conducted four such sessions throughout May and early June. The Western Military Command assisted in arranging these operations. Many of the Japanese personnel {{responsible for the deaths}} of Allied airmen were prosecuted in the Yokohama War Crimes Trials following the war. Several of those found guilty were executed and the remainder were imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Indian Ayurveda {{tradition}} independently {{developed the}} concept of three humours, resembling that of the four humours of ancient Greek medicine, though the Ayurvedic system included further complications, such as the body being composed of five elements and seven basic tissues. Ayurvedic writers also classified living things into four categories based on the method of birth (from the womb, eggs, heat & moisture, and seeds) and explained the conception of a fetus in detail. They also made considerable advances {{in the field of}} surgery, often without the use of human dissection or animal <b>vivisection.</b> One of the earliest Ayurvedic treatises was the Sushruta Samhita, attributed to Sushruta in the 6th century BCE. It was also an early materia medica, describing 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources, and 57 preparations based on animal sources.|$|E
5|$|There Daniel takes part in {{a number}} of experiments, {{including}} the exploration of the diminishing effects of gravity with changes in elevation, the transfusion of blood between dogs and Wilkins' attempts to create a philosophical language. Daniel soon becomes disgusted with some of the practices of the older natural philosophers (which include <b>vivisection</b> of animals) and visits Newton during his experiments with color and white light. They attempt to return to Cambridge, but again plague expels the students. Daniel returns to his father; however, his arrival on the outskirts of London coincides with {{the second day of the}} Fire of London. Drake, taken by religious fervour, dies atop his house as the King blows it up to create a fire break to prevent further spread of the fire. Soon after Drake's death, Newton and Daniel then return to Cambridge and begin lecturing.|$|E
