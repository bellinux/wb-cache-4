40|$|It {{is known}} that it is {{difficult}} to bond dissimilar metals such as aluminum and copper or aluminum and iron using diffusion bonding, because an intermetallic compound is easily produced at the bond interface and bonding strength becomes low. However it is possible to bond the dissimilar metals using the <b>vacuum</b> <b>roll</b> bonding which performs hot rolling in a vacuum. In this study, we investigated the effect of bonding temperature and reduction of aluminum plate thickness on bonding strength of Al/Cu clad materials when aluminum-clad copper (Al/Cu clad) materials were produced at 3 Pa in vacuum degree by the <b>vacuum</b> <b>roll</b> bondings. Bond tensile strength of Al/Cu clad materials increased as the reduction was increased. Their fracture types were classified according to the fracture pass, that is, in the base metal of the aluminum, at the bond interface of Al/Cu clad material or in the base metal and/or at the bond interface. Furthermore, the bond interfaces of Al/Cu clad materials were observed using a transmission electron microscope and an electron dispersive spectroscopy. As a result, it was clarified that Al/Cu clad materials are soundly produced using the <b>vacuum</b> <b>roll</b> bonding when thickness of diffusion layer is less than 60 nm even if intermetallic compounds were developed...|$|E

Despite the technical ability of producing such films there are general phenomena which are not understood at the moment: the mechanisms of gas permeation and adhesion, effects of both substrate properties as well as coating process parameters on barrier properties as well on the change of barrier properties after processing and use. Optical density and surface resistance are currently used as indirect indicators during the coating process to ensure final barrier performance. Applicability and limits {{of the use of}} optical density and surface resistance as control parameters for final barrier properties have been proven.

Definitive causes are not known. Effects of mechanical stress occuring by lamination, on a packaging machine or transport of the hole package on barrier properties, have been investigated.

50|$|Some {{grades of}} paper use suction pick up <b>rolls</b> that use <b>vacuum</b> to {{transfer}} the sheet from the couch to a lead in felt on the first press or between press sections. Pickup roll presses normally have a vacuum box that has two vacuum zones (low vacuum and high <b>vacuum).</b> These <b>rolls</b> have {{a large number of}} drilled holes in the cover to allow the vacuum to pass from the stationary vacuum box through the rotating roll covering. The low vacuum zone picks up the sheet and transfers, while the high vacuum zone attempts to remove moisture. Unfortunately, at high enough speed centrifugal force flings out vacuumed water, making this less effective for dewatering. Pickup presses also have standard felt runs with Uhle boxes. However, pickup press design is quite different, as air movement is important for the pickup and dewatering facets of its role.|$|R

In {{order to}} obtain a sharply cube {{textured}} silver sheet as the substrate for high temperature superconductor (HTS) film with high Jc (critical current density), warm rolling combined with two step annealing treatment has been performed to clarify the perspective of texture formation in pure silver. Two kinds of starting material, which are silver ingots of commercial purity obtained by casting in air and vacuum, were {{used to examine the}} effect of oxygen on texture development. The main feature of warm rolling texture obtained in this study was a strong Brass { 011 } component with minor S { 123 } component, and in some cases, cube { 001 } component or Copper { 112 } component appeared also depending on the warm rolling procedures. Upon crystallization, { 001 }, { 124 } and { 13, 6, 15 } orientations were formed as the dominant components in silver sheets and the relative amount of their orientation components depended on the concrete annealing conditions applied and on the oxygen content. A very sharp single-crystal like cube texture has been successfully realized in the specimen, which was cast in <b>vacuum,</b> warm <b>rolled</b> by 95 percent and subsequently annealed as 150 0 C× 10 min- 500 0 C× 30 min in nitrogen. Finally, we discussed the technological basis on sharp cube texture formation in f. c. c. pure metals with low stacking fault energy...|$|R
50|$|Complex {{plumbing}} {{was needed}} to feed fuel and oxidizer into the clustered arrangement of rocket engines. This proved to be extremely fragile, and was {{a major factor in}} the design's launch failures. Furthermore, the N1's Baikonur launch complex could not be reached by heavy barge. To allow transport by rail, all the stages had to be broken down and re-assembled. The engines for Block A were only test-fired individually and the entire cluster of 30 engines was never static test fired as a unit. Sergei Khrushchev stated that only two out of every batch of six engines were tested, and not the units actually intended for use in the booster. The reason for this was because the NK-15 engines had a number of valves that were activated by pyrotechnics rather than hydraulic or mechanical means, this being a weight-saving measure. Once shut, the valves could not be re-opened. As a result, the complex and destructive vibrational modes (which ripped apart propellant lines and turbines) as well as exhaust plume and fluid dynamic problems (causing vehicle <b>roll,</b> <b>vacuum</b> cavitation, and other problems) in Block A were not discovered and worked out before flight. Blocks B and V were static test fired as complete units.|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} machine, {{it is not}} a desired feature for the {{boundary}} layer flows in the fabric and the roll surfaces to travel into the closing nips, creating overpressure. In this thesis, the aerodynamic behavior of the grooved roll and smooth rolls is compared {{in order to understand the}} nip flow phenomena, which is the main reason why vacuum and grooved roll constructions are designed. A common method to remove the boundary layer flow from the closing nip is to use the <b>vacuum</b> <b>roll</b> construction. The downside of the use of vacuum rolls is high operational costs due to pressure losses in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>roll</b> shell. The deep grooved roll has the same goal, to create a pressure difference over the paper web and keep the paper attached to the roll or fabric surface in the drying pocket of the paper machine. A literature review revealed that the aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll is not very well known. In this thesis, the aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll in interaction with a permeable or impermeable wall is studied by varying the groove properties. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are utilized as the research tool. The simulations have been performed with commercial fluid dynamics software, ANSYS Fluent. Simulation results made with 3 - and 2 -dimensional fluid dynamics models are compared to laboratory scale measurements. The measurements have been made with a grooved roll simulator designed for the research. The variables in the comparison are the paper or fabric wrap angle, surface velocities, groove geometry and wall permeability. Present-day computational and modeling resources limit grooved roll fluid dynamics simulations in the paper machine scale. Based on the analysis of the aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll, a grooved roll simulation tool is proposed. The smooth roll simulations show that the closing nip pressure does not depend on the length of boundary layer development. The surface velocity increase affects the pressure distribution in the closing and opening nips. The 3 D grooved roll model reveals the aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll. With the optimal groove size it is possible to avoid closing nip overpressure and keep the web attached to the fabric surface in the area of the wrap angle. The groove flow friction and minor losses play a different role when the wrap angle is changed. The proposed 2 D grooved roll simulation tool is able to replicate the grooved aerodynamic behavior with reasonable accuracy. A small wrap angle predicts the pressure distribution correctly with the chosen approach for calculating the groove friction losses. With a large wrap angle, the groove friction loss shows too large pressure gradients, and the way of calculating the air flow friction losses in the groove has to be reconsidered. The aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll is based on minor and viscous losses in the closing and opening nips as well as in the grooves. The proposed 2 D grooved roll model is a simplification in order to reduce computational and modeling efforts. The simulation tool makes it possible to simulate complex paper machine constructions in the paper machine scale. In order to use the grooved roll as a replacement for the <b>vacuum</b> <b>roll,</b> the grooved roll properties have to be considered on the basis of the web handling application...|$|E
40|$|SNe & THE UNIVERSE: STUDYING SNc AND USING THEM TO CONTRAIN THE EOS OF THE U NI VERSE. One of the {{remarkable}} results in cosmology of the past 11 {{years has been the}} evidence of a cosmological constant, Λ. The evidence comes from a convergence of data from various cosmological tests, including the comparison of low and high redshift Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), the angular structure of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), estimates of the age of the Universe, and measurements of the masses of clusters of galaxies. Analysis of distant SNIa colors over a wide wavelength base, and studies of the most distant SNIa ever observed suggest that systematic effects like gray dust or SN evolution are not mimicking acceleration. It is extremely important to constant check by systematic errors, but it appears increasingly unlikely that the evidence for a non zero A is due to an unappreciated systematic effect. The importance of this measurement cannot be overstated. The acceleration of the Universe could be the first experimental manifestation of gravitational unification effects beyond the Standard Model. Although a cosmological constant A fits perfectly in the frame of relativistic cosmology, and is the simplest explanation to the acceleration of the Universe, the small vacuum energy density measured does not fit well with current particle physics models. In addition, the cosmological constant implies a timing problem to solve, among other theoretical nuisances. These issues lead theoreticians to consider alternative forms for the <b>vacuum</b> energy: <b>Rolling</b> scalar fields ("quintessence"), domain walls, k-essence, etc. The ESSENCE survey, which is supported by this project, is designed {{to understand the nature of}} the Dark Energy, by setting constraints on its equation of state parameter w, where, if p is the (negative) pressure exerted by the unknown component and p its energy density, then p=wp. The main goal of ESSENCE is to determine the value of w with a 10 % uncertainty. ESSENCE uses SNIa, the best dstance indicators for cosmologically relevant distances, between redshifts of 0. 15 and 0. 75 to build a precise and evenly populated Hubble diagram and use it to fit the equation of state parameter w. ESSENCE survey, awarded 150 half nights by NOAO, obtains the SNe using the 4. Om CTIO telescope with the CCD MOSAJC camera. Searches are done every other night during dark time from October to December for a period of 6 years. Follow up spectroscopic and infrared observations are done with 6 m and 8 m ground based telescopes and from the HST. The survey obtained ~ 200 SNIa, enough to meet the statistical uncertainty proposed. The specific goal of this FONDECYT proposal is to support the work of the PI and his students with ESSENCE. Resources are used to participate in observing, support operation costs, join ESSENCE workshops, support students doing master or undergraduate thesis on spin-off projects derived from the survey, pay for publication and conference costs, and pay assistants to perform low level tasks related with data taking and reduction. In addition to the main ESSENCE program, other projects are done based on the ESSENCE SNe, as well as on other events particularly bright or interesting.
