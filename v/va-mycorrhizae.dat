40|$|The {{effects of}} sand {{accretion}} on the lacustrine sand dune vegetation of Lakes Huron and Erie were studied. The tolerance {{and response to}} burial in sand of several dune species, namely, Ammophila breviligulata, Adropogon scoparious, Agropyron psammophilum, Artemisia campestris, Calamovilfa longifolia, Cakile edentula, Cirsium pitcheri, Corispermum hyssopifolium, Elymus canadensis, Equisetum arvense, Euphorbia polygonifolia, Lithospermum caroliniense, Melilotus alba, Oenothera biennis, Panicum virgatum, Poa compressa, Strophostyles helvola, Tusilago farfara, Populas balsamifera and Xanthium strumarium were examined under controlled (greenhouse and growth chamber) and natural (field) conditions. This study clearly showed {{that the amount of}} sand deposition was variable in different microsites and depended on the amount of sand brought up by the waves, the wind velocity, the distance from the lake, type of vegetation, and the time of year. The distribution of plants in the dunes was correlated with the extent of sand accretion and tolerance limits of species. For example, Ammophila breviligulata was present in areas where there was more than 50 cm of sand movement (erosion and accretion) in two growing seasons. Simulated burial experiments in the field showed that although there were significant differences between species in their tolerance limits, all dune species exhibited stimulation of the net COdollar 2 dollar uptake, leaf area, and biomass per plant at varying levels of burial in sand. The positive effects of burial were much more pronounced in the perennials, Agropyron psammophilum and Panicum virgatum, than in the annuals or biennials. Similar stimulation in growth following burial was also observed under controlled greenhouse and growth chamber conditions in all the species investigated. For example, in the greenhouse burial experiment Elymus canadensis plants buried to one third of their height had a COdollar 2 dollar exchange rate of 28 dollarμdollarmol mdollarlcub- 2 rcubdollar sdollarlcub- 1 rcubdollar as compared to 18 dollarμdollarmol mdollarlcub- 2 rcubdollar sdollarlcub- 1 rcubdollar for control plants. There were marked differences between species in their response to the different depths of burial and the length of time after the burial treatment. Light intensities and temperature regimes also made significant differences in the carbon dioxide exchange rate under growth chamber conditions. Another well recognized aspect in plant communities is the occurrence of mutualistic association with soil fungi to form mycorrhizae. A field survey of the dune plant community along Lake Erie, revealed that a large majority of plant species were colonized by vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (<b>VA-Mycorrhizae)</b> fungi. With the exception of Equisetum arvense all 11 species had variable percentages of vesicular, arbuscular and hyphal colonization. Greenhouse experiments showed that although <b>VA-Mycorrhizae</b> enhanced the morphological and physiological responses in dune plants, there were not solely responsible for the enhanced growth exhibited by buried plants. Agropyron psammophilum had a CER value of 15 dollarμdollarmol mdollarlcub- 2 rcubdollar sdollarlcub- 1 rcubdollar for unburied plants containing <b>VA-Mycorrhizae</b> and 18 dollarμdollarmol mdollarlcub- 2 rcubdollar sdollarlcub- 1 rcubdollar for VA-Mycorrhizae-free plants that were buried and 25 dollarμdollarmol mdollarlcub- 2 rcubdollar sdollarlcub- 1 rcubdollar for buried <b>VA-Mycorrhizae</b> containing plants...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} the Demonstration Farm of the faculty of Agriculture, University of Khartoum at Shambat during the period December 1997 to June, 1999, to investigate the effect of Rhizobium meliloti and <b>VA-mycorrhizae</b> on growth, forage yield and quality of two alfalfa cultivars (local Hegazi and imported Pioneer 5929). The treatments consisted of inoculation with Rhizobium melilotti, <b>VA-mycorrhizae,</b> and (VAM+R) {{in addition to a}} reference control. A split- plot design with three replications was used in which the two alfalfa cultivars were assigned to the main plots and the microorganisms to the sub-plot treatments. Rhizobium melilotti, <b>VA-mycorrhizae,</b> and their combinations significantly improved growth parameters, which were reflected in higher yields of good quality forage. Rhizobium melilotti increased forage fresh yields by 42 %, whereas the increments in forage fresh yields by VAM alone and VAM+R were 60 % and 65 %, respectively. The forage nutritive value was improved by Rhizobia inoculation in the winter samples by 26. 9 % for the crude protein and by 32. 3 % for phosphorus content. Corresponding increments for the joint effect of VAM+R were 23. 2 % for crude protein and 36. 1 % for phosphorus compared to the control. The local cultivar Hegazi outscored the introduced Pioneer in the growth parameters which were reflected in higher forage yield of good quality compared to the introduced one. It produced 25. 7 % more protein than the Pioneer variety. أجريت تجربة حقلية في المزرعة التجريبية بكلية الزراعة جامعة الخرطوم خلال الفترة من ديسمبر 1997 الى يونيو 1999 لدراسة اثر بكتيريا الرايزوبيوم وفطر الماكورايزا على إنتاجية ونوعية صنفين من البرسيم (الحجازي وبايونير 5929 ‏). اشتملت المعاملات على بكتريا الرايزوبيوم وفطر الماكورايزا بالإضافة الى الشاهد. استعمل تصميم الأحواض الانشطارية بثلاث مكررات • وضعت أصناف البرسيم في الأحواض الرئيسية ومعاملات الأحياء الدقيقة في الأحواض الفرعية. ‏أظهرت معاملات إضافة البكتيريا ، الفطر ، و البكتيريا + الفطر زيادة معنوية في معايير النمو والتي انعكست في زيادة الإنتاجية ونوعية الغلف. وقد زاد الوزن الرطب للعلف بمقدار 42 % بإضافة البكتيريا بينما كانت الزيادات 60 % و 65 % نتيجة لإضافة الفطر والفطر + البكتيريا على التوالي. ‏إضافة البكتيريا أدت الى تحسن القيمة الغذائية للملف حيث زاد معدل البروتين الخام بنسبة 27 % والفسفور بنسبة 32 %. وكانت الزيادات المقابلة نتيجة لإضافة الفطر والبكتيريا 23 % للبروتين الخام و 36 % للفسفور. تفوق الصنف المحلى حجازي على المستورد بايونير في معايير النمو والتي انعكست على الإنتاجية العالية وتحسن القيمة الغذائية حيث زادت نسبة البروتين الخام في الصنف حجازي بنسبة 26 % مقارنة بالبايونير...|$|E

The effects of irrigation with sewage water and NPK fertilization were determined. Potted wheat plants in a greenhouse were used. The highest increase in dry matter production and N and P content was recorded for NPK and <b>VA-mycorrhiza</b> + Azospirillum treatment. Inoculation with either <b>VA-mycorrhiza</b> or. Azospirillum had similar effects on wheat growth, while inoculation with both organisms result in higher growth increase than either of them alone. The percentage increase of shoot dry matter over the control group was 56. 7, 16. 2, 21. 6, and 37. 8 % for NPK, <b>VA-mycorrhiza,</b> Azospirillum, and <b>VA-mycorrhiza</b> + Azospirillum treatments, respectively. A similar increase was found with roots and spikes. Also, the inoculation of <b>VA-mycorrhiza</b> with Azospirillum caused an increase in acetylene reduction activity; hence, it reached an average of 60 and 90 {{times that of the}} inoculated control in the cases of inoculation with Azospirillum and <b>VA-mycorrhiza</b> + Azospirillum respectively. Irrigation increased dry matter production and N and P content of plants.

40|$|The {{development}} of 750 cupuacu plants has been monitored after 3 ½ and 4 ½ years of growt {{in three different}} mixed cultivation systems and one monoculture. It {{has been found that}} the plant development vary significantly between the planting systems, the monoculture providing the worst conditions for the rapid maturation of cupuacu plants. Additionally it could be ascertained, that the {{development of}} cupuacu plants is significantly affected by distance to the adjacent primary or secondary forest. The strength of this influence lies in the range of the tendency obtained by different levels of fertilization (30 % and 100 % of recommeded dose). Other tested parameters (inoculation with <b>VA-mycorrhiza</b> fungi, topography in terms of slope and altitude) are not correlated with the development of cupuacu plants, excepting an evident edaphic influence, which becomes perceptible between the three western repetition blocks of the experiment and the two eastern blocks.

40|$|The {{effect of}} dual {{inoculation}} with endomycorrhizae and Rhizobium mililoti on the nodulation,nutrients uptake and symbiotic N 2 -fixation of alfalfa grown on calcareous soil was studied {{in a pot}} experiment under different levels of phosphate sources(either superphosphate or rock-phosphate). Results have shown that inoculation with both Rhizobium mililoti and <b>VA-mycorrhizae</b> significanly increased the nodulation, N 2 -ase activity,plant growth, P and miconutrients uptake and nitrogen contents of the plants. Application of rock-phosphate rather than superphosphate stimulated the abovementioned parameters. Superphosphate depressed the root-colonization with VAM and affected the nodulation and the symbiotic N 2 -fixation to some extent compared with rock-phosphate. Application of micronutrients namely Fe+++ and Mo has no observed effect on the nodulation and N 2 -fixation of alfalfa plants inoculated with both endomycorrhizae and Rhizobium, while it has stimulatory effect on those not-treated with VAM.

40|$|Mycorrhizal {{symbiosis}} {{has been}} studied {{for a long time}} given its interest for the nutrition of plants (Masui 1927) and later on for their resistance to pathogens (Marx & Davey 1967) and survival in deleterious or harsh conditions (Clément et al. 1977, Marx & Artman 1979). Fungal partners may be found in the three most common groups of soil fungi, i. e. zygomycetes, ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. Each of these groups is responsible for a given type of mycorrhiza, vs. vesicular-arbuscular- (VA), ericoid and ectomycorrhizae, respectively. Some genera of ascomycetes, such as Tuber, Elaphomyces, and Cenococcum, are ectomycorrhizal. Roughly speaking, <b>VA-mycorrhizae</b> are commonly found in most herbs and nutrient-rich deciduous trees (ash, maple, etc [...] .), ericoid mycorrhizae in Ericaceae and allies, and ectomycorrhizae in nutrient-poor deciduous trees (oak, beech, etc [...] .), and most coniferous trees (Moore 1987). The association between mycorrhizal types and botanical classification of host plants was used by Read (1991) to stress the importance of the mycorrhizal symbiosis at the ecosystem level and moreover at the biome level.

40|$|ABSTRACT Assessing {{the impact}} of {{herbivory}} on plant growth and reproduction is important to predict the success of biocontrol of invasive plants. Leaf area production is most important, as photosynthesis provides the foundation for all plant growth and fitness. High levels of defoliation generally reduce the productivity of plants. However, leaf area production fluctuates during the season and compensational growth may occur, which both complicate accurate estimations of defoliation impacts. Under field conditions the interaction with neighbouring species {{and the availability of}} soil nutrients need to be assessed in order to gauge long term effects of weed invasions on natural environments. 	In this thesis I have investigated seasonal leaf area dynamics in Buddleia davidii following repeated artificial defoliation, to quantify compensational leaf production and to understand the regulatory mechanisms involved. The impact of defoliation on photosynthesis, seed production, germination and nitrogen translocation patterns were analysed. Finally, possible facilitation between B. davidii and a native nitrogen fixer, Coriaria arborea, and {{the impact of}} B. davidii on soil nutrient availability were investigated. 	In defoliated B. davidii, increased node production (34 %), leaf size (35 %) and leaf longevity (12 %) resulted in 52 % greater total emergent leaf area in the short term. However, with time and diminishing tissue resources the compensation declined. No upregulation of photosynthesis was observed in pre-existing leaves. Compensational leaf area production occurred at the expense of reproduction but the germination capacity of individual seeds was unaffected. In B. davidii, nitrogen reserves are stored in old leaves. Thus, the defoliation-induced decline in tissue reserves led to changes in the remobilisation pattern and increased the importance of soil uptake but biomass production especially that of roots had declined significantly (39 %). Slight facilitation effects from the neighbouring nitrogen fixer and <b>VA-mycorrhizae</b> were observed on B. davidii in the field, while its impact on soil chemistry during spring was negligible. 	Defoliation of B. davidii resulted in priority allocation of resources to compensational leaf growth and a concomitant reduction in flower and seed production. The compensational leaf production greatly increased the demand for nitrogen, while continued leaf removal decreased the pool of stored nitrogen. This led to changes in nitrogen remobilisation and an increased importance of root uptake. However, the significant decline in root growth will likely impair adequate nutrient uptake from the soil, which is especially important where B. davidii invades nutrient poor habitats and will increase the success of biocontrol of the species. While mycorrhizae increase nutrient accessibility for B. davidii, {{it is likely that the}} additional stress of defoliation will negate the small facilitative effects from nitrogen-fixing species like C. arborea. 	This research provides new insights into the mechanisms regulating leaf area dynamics at the shoot level and systemic physiological responses to defoliation in plants, such as nitrogen translocation. The compensation in leaf area production was considerable but only transitory and thus, the opportunity to alleviate effects of leaf loss though adjustment of light capture limited. However, to ascertain that photosynthesis at whole plant level does not increase after defoliation, more detailed measurements especially on new grown leaves are necessary. In general, defoliation had greatly reduced plant growth and performance so that an optimistic outlook for controlling this species can be given. Conclusions about the wider impacts of B. davidii on soil chemistry and community function will require further research...|$|E
40|$|Lobelia dortmanna leads a {{group of}} small, highly-valued rosette species that grow on coarse, nutrient-poor soils in {{temperate}} soft-water lakes. They acquire most CO 2 for photosynthesis by root uptake and efficient gas transport in large air channels to the leaves. Lobelia is the only species that releases virtually all photosynthetic oxygen from the roots and generates profound day-night changes in oxygen and CO 2 in the sediment pore-water. While oxygen release from roots stimulates decomposition and supports <b>VA-mycorrhiza</b> fungi, the ready gas exchange presents a risk of insufficient oxygen supply to the distal root meristems as sediments accumulate organic matter from lake pollution. So the plant with the greatest oxygen release from roots {{is also the most}} sensitive to oxygen depletion in sediments and it dies or losses anchorage by shortening the roots from 10 to 2 cm at even modest contents (2. 4 %) of degradable organic matter. Coatings of oxidized iron on roots in organically enriched sediments reduce radial oxygen loss and, thereby, increase internal concentrations and supply of oxygen to root tips. Oxidized iron is also a redox buffer which may prevent the ingress of sulfides and other reduced toxic solutes during nights. Controlled experiments are under way to test if iron enrichment can help survival of rosette species threatened by lake pollution or whether removal of organic surface sediments is required...|$|R

Trees were grown in 10 l plastic pots in unsterilized sandy clay soil (Fluvisols) under climatic conditions of South Moravia (49 °, 25 ´ N; 16 °, 55 ´ E), Czech Republic. Leaves were sampled eight times during the experiment (four times per year) for analysis of: N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, and Mn. Mycorrhizal infection was determined with the gridline-intersection method. Inoculated plants showed higher VA root infection during both years (best results were 46 % on {{the first year and}} 41. 7 % on the second year) and higher leaf P concentrations, in particular when biopreparations were applied together (P = 0. 23 % DW), than non inoculated (4 % of root infection during year one and 15 % during year two; P = 0. 183 % DW). N, K, Ca and Mg were not significantly affected by treatments. In many cases application of biopreparations decreased Fe, Mn and Zn leaf levels. Shoot length was strongly enhanced in inoculated plants only during the first year (46 % more than non inoculated). No significant differences were detected between inoculated and non inoculated plants for: trunk diameter, spur number, root volume, leaf dry weight, number of blossoms and yield. It is concluded that the studied biopreparations have the capacity to colonize and persist in the roots of apple trees (VA-mycorrhizal fungus), enhance the uptake of phosphorus and vegetative growth but they could decreased the uptake of Fe, Mn and Zn...|$|R
40|$|Cassava is an {{important}} crop in India, with an area of 289, 000 ha and production of 5. 6 million t of fresh roots in 1991. It is mainly cultivated in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and in the Northeastern states. A large variation in cassava consumption exists between {{urban and rural areas}} in India. About 70 % of cassava production in Kerala is used for food. In Tamil Nadu, however, only 25 % is used for human consumption, while the rest is used for industrial utilization, mainly for starch production. About 17 % of cassava production in the country is used for animal feed. Cassava is used in industry for production of starch, sago, liquid glucose, dextrin, vitamin C, gums and high-fructose syrup. Earlier agronomy research concentrated on the development of cultural practices and soil fertility management for cassava grown in monoculture. Recently, research has focused on the development of cassava-based cropping systems, soil fertility management with emphasis on micronutrients and bio-fertilizers (especially <b>VA-mycorrhiza),</b> low-input technology, water management and production practices for non-traditional areas. Short-duration cassava cultivars were shown to produce higher root yields at closer spacing of 75 x 75 cm, while for cassava grown under coconuts a plant population of 8000 /ha was found to be optimum. Under intercropping with groundnut or cowpea the paired-row cassava system performed best. In acid infertile soils in Kerala, continuous cropping of cassava with application of only NPK chemical fertilizers resulted in a depletion of Ca, Mg, Cu and Zn in the soil. From the study on interrelationships of cations the optimum doses of K, Ca and Mg were found to be 146 kg K^O, 56 kg Ca and 37 kg Mg/ha. Incorporation of ZnSO at 12. 5 kg/ha increased the root yield 12 %. An NPK application of 50 : 62 : 62 kg/ha was sufficient for the cassava-ground nut intercropping system if the haulms of groundnut were turned back into the soil. For cassava grown under coconut an NPK rate of 50 : 50 : 100 kg/ha gave higher net returns. For rice-cassava sequential cropping on paddy soils the P application rate to cassava could be reduced to 25 kg P O /ha. In calcareous soils of Tamil Nadu short duration cassava cultivars performed better at lower levels of NPK (75 : 25 : 75 kg/ha). Application of a liquid NPK fertilizer at the rate of 8 - 8 - 8 kg/ha was equally effective as the same rate applied in solid form. Inoculation of VA mycorrhiza (VAM) enhanced the dry matter production, root yield and uptake of P, Cu and Zn in cassava. For successful field inoculation a nursery techniquewas developed. To realize the production potential of high-yielding cassava, the application of NPK at 150 : 100 : 150 kg/ha and supplementary irrigation at an IW/CPE ratio of 1 were found necessary. In cassava-groundnut intercropping systems, supplementary irrigation during drought periods at 25 mm/week enhanced the yield of both crops. Studies on effects of subsoil moisture on cassava showed that a shallow water table (around 40 cm from the surface) depressed root yields...|$|R
