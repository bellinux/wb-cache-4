Parallel <b>video</b> <b>servers</b> become inevitable to provide large capacity required by the system that can service thousands of concurrent clients. There are two major types of parallel video servers: shared memory multiprocessors and distributed memory clustered architectures. In a multiprocessor system, there are a set of storage nodes, a set of computing nodes, and a shared memory. The data to be retrieved {{is sent to the}} memory buffer through a high-speed network or bus, and then to the clients. A mass storage system has presented the capacity of supportin [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- People {{have put}} more {{emphasis}} on stream-scheduling policies to build high performance <b>video</b> <b>servers.</b> But the most important aim of these traditional stream-scheduling schemes {{is to improve the}} resource utilization, such as memory, network bandwidth and CPU, to maximize the number of concurrent streams. These schemes did not consider the QoS needs of video streaming or described the QoS parameter weakly, so the media streams average qualities have no guarantees when the number of media streams is very large. Traditional schemes put little consideration on cluster <b>video</b> <b>servers.</b> In this paper, we will propose a new two-layer stream-scheduling scheme with QoS control for cluster <b>video</b> <b>servers.</b> We first proposed new definitions for video streams with the consideration of QoS and then described the scheme of how to schedule video streams from two layers. The target of this scheme is to improve the average QoS of all streaming tasks and to obtain large number of scheduled video streams...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} three storage {{systems for}} movieson -demand <b>video</b> <b>servers.</b> We show that striped disk farms, in which portions of movies are interleaved among disks, perform best. They achieve close to full disk utilization, good load balancing, {{and the lowest}} cost per video stream. Disk farms that store one movie per disk have lower performance, since disks holding less popular movies are under-utilized; however, these systems achieve relatively good performance by replicating movies according to their popularity in the request pattern. Finally, we evaluate the use of storage hierarchies to support movies-on-demand video service. We show that their performance is so poor that their effective cost per video stream is two orders of magnitude {{higher than that of}} magnetic disk systems. We conclude that for the foreseeable future, most <b>video</b> <b>servers</b> will store movies entirely on disk.
