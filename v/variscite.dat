2500|$|Nevada is the country's {{other major}} producer, {{with more than}} 120 mines which have yielded {{significant}} quantities of turquoise. Unlike elsewhere in the US, most Nevada mines have been worked primarily for their gem turquoise and very little has been recovered as a byproduct of other mining operations. Nevada turquoise is found as nuggets, fracture fillings and in breccias as the cement filling interstices between fragments. Because of the geology of the Nevada deposits, {{a majority of the}} material produced is hard and dense, being of sufficient quality that no treatment or enhancement is required. While nearly every county in the state has yielded some turquoise, the chief producers are in Lander and Esmeralda counties. Most of the turquoise deposits in Nevada occur along a wide belt of tectonic activity that coincides with the state's zone of thrust faulting. It strikes about N15°E and extends from the northern part of Elko County, southward down to the California border southwest of Tonopah. Nevada has produced a wide diversity of colours and mixes of different matrix patterns, with turquoise from Nevada coming in various shades of blue, blue-green, and green. Some of this unusually coloured turquoise may contain significant zinc and iron, which is the cause of the beautiful bright green to yellow-green shades. Some of the green to green yellow shades may actually be <b>variscite</b> or faustite, which are secondary phosphate minerals similar in appearance to turquoise. A significant portion of the Nevada material is also noted for its often attractive brown or black limonite veining, producing what is called [...] "spiderweb matrix". While a number of the Nevada deposits were first worked by Native Americans, the total Nevada turquoise production since the 1870s has been estimated at more than 600 tons, including nearly 400 tons from the Carico Lake mine. In spite of increased costs, small scale mining operations continue at a number of turquoise properties in Nevada, including the Godber, Orvil Jack and Carico Lake mines in Lander County, the Pilot Mountain Mine in Mineral County, and several properties in the Royston and Candelaria areas of Esmerelda County.|$|E

40|$|Powdery {{deposits}} of pale green chalcosiderite occur on <b>variscite</b> {{on a few}} specimens. Salvador and Fayos (1972) recognise two struc-tural variants of <b>variscite</b> which they term 'Lucin-type ' and 'Messbach-type'. The two types appear to share the same space group, but the unit cell of 'Messbach-type ' has doubled length along the c-axis. The distinction is attributed to differing arrangement of structural water. All <b>variscite</b> specimens from Gunheath Pit so far examined (including powdery <b>variscite</b> from the spherulite cores) are of 'Lucin-type'.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{reports on}} Raman and IR spectra of the <b>variscite</b> {{phosphate}} minerals and relates the vibrational spectra to the mineral structure. The {{application of the}} spectroscopy is in the possible determination of colloidal <b>variscite</b> minerals in soils. The <b>variscite</b> mineral group are orthorhombic arsenates and phosphate with the general formula AXO 4. 2 H 2 O, where A = Al 3 +, Fe 3 +, Cr 3 + or In 3 + and X = As or P, with space group Pcab. The most common of the phosphate minerals are strengite (Fe 3 + PO 4. 2 H 2 O) and <b>variscite</b> (AlPO 4. 2 H 2 O) [1], with metavariscite, metastrengite and phosphosiderite (also known as clinostrengite) less common. Strengite forms a series with <b>variscite</b> and is dimorphous with metavariscite. <b>Variscite</b> is dimorphous with metavariscite [2, 3]. Metavariscite (AlPO 4. 2 H 2 O) is monoclinic with the space group P 21 /n. The formation of <b>variscite</b> group minerals in soils is of importance. It is probable that colloidal <b>variscite</b> and strengite are important in the uptake of phosphorus by plants [4, 5]. Such minerals can be formed through the weathering of phosphate rocks but a {{more likely to be}} formed through the addition of rock phosphates to soils. Raman spectroscopy of phosphates of the <b>variscite</b> mineral group namely strengite, <b>variscite,</b> metavariscite and phosphosiderite have been obtained at 298 K and 77 K using a thermal stage.

40|$|AMS {{radiocarbon}} and OSL dating, and profiling {{were used}} to directly delimit periods of <b>variscite</b> production at Pico CentenoMine 2. These resultswere integratedwith analysis of otherwell-dated periods of <b>variscite</b> production to establish an Iberian-wide chronological framework. <b>Variscite</b> production at Pico Centeno Mine 2 began at ~ 5200 BC, coincident with alpine jade production or Casa Montero Iberian flint production. <b>Variscite</b> was only used occasionally, together with other greenstones, during the 5 th and 6 th millennia BC. During the 4 thmillenniumBC, <b>variscite</b> use began to increase to its apogee {{in the first half}} of 3 rd millenniumBC when it appeared in nearly every Iberian burial site. This increase in <b>variscite</b> production and use coincided with decline in the popularity of alpine jade. By the end of the 3 rd millennium BC, new resources began to be valued such as Asian and African Ivory, Baltic and Sicilian amber, and copper-based metal products. The <b>variscite</b> cycle thus started with the decline of jade in the 5 th– 4 th millennium BC, and ended with the appearance of copper, ivory and extra-peninsular amber by the end of the 3 rd millennium BC. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} measurements, during {{halogen lamp}} illumination to simulate sunlight, (TXRD) show a phase transition from <b>variscite</b> (AlPO 4 ·H 2 O) Messbach to <b>variscite</b> Lucin {{and a loss}} of the dark green colour. The differential-thermal and thermo-gravimetric (DTA-TG) analyses and thermoluminescence (TL) peaks all depict this first-order phase transition which takes place under sunlight. From the water vaporization temperature up to circa 650 °C, a second-order phase transition progressively occurs from <b>variscite</b> to berlinite (AlPO 4) by loss of a second unit of water with hydrogen bonded to the lattice. The ion beam luminescence (IBL) spectra of the Zamora <b>variscite</b> display a spectral band from 500 to 570 nm attributed to [UO 2] 2 + in phosphates, and another spectral band from 670 to 740 nm is linked with Cr(VI) 3 + defects situated in octahedral Al(VI) 3 + positions. In the hydrous <b>variscite</b> lattice, the Al¿O and P¿O chemical bonds are mainly covalent; with the degree of covalency of the P¿O chemical bond significantly larger than of Al¿O.

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} on a phosphatized sediment {{sequence in}} the Cioclovina Cave {{led to the}} identification of a second occurrence in Romania (first time in the cave environment) of <b>variscite,</b> AlPO 4 · 2 H 2 O. The mineral exists as dull-white, tiny crusts and veinlets within the thick argillaceous material accumulated on the cave floor.

Multiple phosphate stretching bands are observed. Bands for strengite at 1006, 1012 and 1026 cm- 1 at 298 K and at 997, 1006, 1014 and 1027 cm- 1 at 77 K are observed. <b>Variscite</b> {{is characterized by}} PO stretching vibrations at 1023, 1005 and 938 cm- 1 and phosphosiderite by bands at 1009 and 993 cm- 1.

40|$|The {{color of}} <b>variscite</b> from three {{different}} localities (Pannecé, France; Sarrabus, Sardinia; Ervedosa, Portugal) and metavariscite from Utah was investigated by diffuse reß ectance and EPR spectroscopy. These samples contain low levels of transition elements such as V, Cr, and Fe, the relative concentra- tion of which varies with origin, although they remain in the wt% range. The presence of peculiar antiresonance features indicates that octahedral Cr 3 + ions {{are responsible for the}} absorption bands that cause the green coloration of <b>variscite</b> and metavariscite. Trivalent iron ions, which give only a weak absorption band in some samples, and V 3 + ions do not contribute to the green coloration of the samples from these locations.
