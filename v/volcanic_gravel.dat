This is the longest cell of littoral sand transport documented so far. Compositional forward modeling indicates that ≥. 80 % of dune sand in the Skeleton Coast is Orange-derived, the remaining ≤. 20 % being supplied by slow erosion of the Damara Orogen chiefly via the Swakop River. A decrease in basaltic rock fragments and pyroxene with relative enrichment in garnet, staurolite, tourmaline and other metamorphic minerals north of Walvis Bay indicates that only one-third of beach sand in the 350. km dune-free gap between the Namib and Skeleton Coast Ergs is Orange-derived, the remaining two-thirds being supplied largely by the Swakop River draining the Damara Orogen. Although <b>volcanic</b> <b>gravel</b> becomes dominant in beaches of the Skeleton Coast north of the Uniab mouth, detritus from Cretaceous Etendeka lavas accounts for only 4 % of beach sand, reflecting limited sand generation in the arid catchment.

40|$|Trenching {{was carried}} out in 1980 and 1982 on the {{alluvial}} plain in the Tanna basin, Izu, central Japan, to obtain evidence for Holocene activities of the Tanna fault, along which the last seismic displacement accompanied the Kita-Izu earthquake(M 7. 3) of 1930. A. D. The 1982 -trench was seven meters deep. The deposits exposed consisted mainly of silt, peat, <b>volcanic</b> <b>gravel</b> and sand with thin layers of air-fall tephras of known ages, Akahoya ash(ca. 6, 300 y. B. P.), Kawagodaira pumice (ca. 2, 900 y. B. P.), Zunasawa scoria (2, 500 y. B. P.) and Kozushima ash (838 A. D.). The Tanna fault was observed in the unconsolidated deposits as a zone 1 - 2 meter wide, consisting of apparently discontinuous faults, fissure-filling deposits and intrusive silty material from below. The zone stands nearly vertical or steeply dipping to the west. The features useful in recognizing individual faulting events were: 1) unconformity between the lower, more complicated structure and the upper, less complicated one. 2) elastic wedges or pockets filling the open-cracks along the fault zone, protruding down to the underlying beds. 3) alternation of two kinds of beds: beds with uniform thickness and those with different thickness across the fault zone. The latter are marker deposits for an individual vertical displacement, which produced scarplet or flexure on the ground surface along the fault zone. The beds thicken toward the downthrown side across the fault zone. The beds with uniform thickness indicate no scarp-making fault movement during the deposition. We compared the thickness of each time-stratigraphic bed {{on both sides of the}} fault zone, taking into consideration the effect of left-lateral strike-slip displacement of the beds which were deposited with thickness increasing toward the south. Nine events are recognized in the deposits after deposition of Akahoya ash, including the last event of 1930 A. D. The third youngest event is probably the historical great earthquake of 841 A. D. reported from this province. Eight of the nine events have the western side of the fault zone downthrown and only one had the eastern side downthrown. The ages of the beds and events are inferred in two ways: (1) based on the four tephras of known age (uncorrected 14 C age) and an assumption of a constant rate of deposition between the tephras, and (2) based on corrected "C age (calendar date) for the tephras and selected 14 C samples. Recurrence intervals of the events in the past ca. 6, 000 - 7, 000 years thus inferred are fairly constant with a period of about 700 - 1000 years...|$|E

40|$|Shallow-water {{hydrothermal}} vents occur world-wide {{in regions}} of volcanic activity. The vents located at Tutum Bay, Ambitle Island, Papua New Guinea are {{unique in that}} the vent fluids and surrounding sediments contain {{some of the highest}} concentrations of arsenic in a natural system. This study addresses the effects of the vent system on the benthic communities, focusing on the eukaryotes, macrofauna, meiofauna and bacteria. Samples were collected in November 2003 and May/June 2005. Analysis of the 2003 macrofaunal samples indicated that pH, rather than arsenic was influencing the benthic community, and that the hydrothermal influence occurred at a greater distance than expected. Results of more intensive sampling carried out in 2005 are the primary focus of this dissertation. The pore water and sediment characteristics revealed distinct physical habitats corresponding with distance from the vent. There was a trend of decreasing temperature and arsenic concentration and increasing salinity and pH with distance from the vent. The vent sediment was poorly sorted <b>volcanic</b> <b>gravel,</b> while sediments along the transect showed a gradient from fine, well sorted volcanic sands to coarser carbonate sands farther away. The macrofauna showed a trend of increasing diversity with distance from the vent and similar taxa were present in both the 2003 and 2005 samples. The vent community was dominated by the polychaete Capitella cf. capitata. The inner transect from 30 m to 140 m had low diversity. Dominant taxa included thalassinid shrimp and the amphipod Platyischnopus sp. A. The 180 m to 300 m sites had significantly higher diversity. The Danlum Bay reference site had relatively higher diversity than the nearshore transect sites and was dominated by deposit feeding polychaetes. Macrofaunal community structure was influenced by the sediment characteristics, notably by CaCO 3 content, sorting and median grain size. The meiofaunal community also showed changes with distance from the vent. Chromadorid nematodes were dominant at the vent site and were a major component of the meiofauna at most sites, along with copepods. The meiofaunal community at the reference site showed greater similarity to the vent community and both sites had low abundances. Nematodes were more abundant than copepods near the vent, but copepods were more abundant farther offshore and at the reference site. Meiofaunal community structure was influenced primarily by the pore water temperature and salinity. Biological interactions with the macrofaunal community through physical disturbance and predation may also influence the meiofaunal community. ﻿ The molecular analysis of eukaryotic and bacterial diversity also revealed changes with distance from the vent. The 0 m and reference sites grouped together due to the presence of fungal sequences and the 140 m and 300 m sites grouped together due to a common molluscan sequence. Metazoans and fungi dominated the eukaryote sequences. The most abundant eukaryotic OTUs included fungi matching Paecilomyces sp. and Cladosporium cladosporioides and metazoans matching Viscosia viscosa (Nematoda) and Astarte castanea represented by 24 phyla and was dominated by Actinobacteria and γ-Proteobacteria. More bacterial phyla were present near the vent, while more overall OTUs were found at the intermediate sites along the transect. The most distant site had much lower diversity dominated by Firmicutes. The macrofaunal community had the strongest correlation with environmental variables. Comparison between the meiofauna and the metazoan sequences showed the proportion of nematodes found in both datasets were comparable, but the meiofauna analysis found a higher proportion of arthropods, while the molecular results were disproportionally high for platyhelminthes. Overall, the vents increased the complexity of the system by creating unique habitats. The extreme environment created by the hydrothermal activity maintained the surrounding habitat at an early successional stage colonized by a few opportunistic species. There was a gradation in the benthic communities away from the vent towards a more carbonate based climax community. The low pH environment had an effect on the sediment composition, which in turn influenced the benthic community. These findings can {{serve as a model for}} studying the potential effects of ocean acidification and climate change on benthic communities and marine biocomplexity...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The thesis area {{is located}} in the southeastern corner of Harney County, Oregon. This portion of Oregon is {{situated}} {{in the northern part of}} the Basin and Range province, and is characterized by both mafic and silicic extrusives, and localized nonmarine sediments and tuffs ranging in age from middle (?) Miocene to Recent. The rocks of Miocene and some Pliocene age have been cut by normal faults forming typical Basin and Range structure. The base of the stratigraphic sequence within the thesis area is formed by 775 feet of thin, highly porphyritic basalt flows. On the basis of petrographic and field similarities, these basalts have been correlated with the Steens Basalt of Fuller (1931). Overlying the porphyritic basalts are 980 feet of fine-grained, andesitic basalt flows, and flow breccias. These basalts superficially resemble the Steens Mountain volcanic series of Fuller but they occupy a higher stratigraphic position and may be correlative with the Owyhee Basalt of Renick (1931). Covering the andesitic basalt, but generally poorly exposed are approximately 155 feet of vitric and lithic-vitric air fall tuffs. These tuffs and the overlying ash flow tuffs may be genetically related and probably represent a period of silicic extrusion within the thesis area. Four ash flow tuffs are recognized and described. They appear to have been extruded over a short period of time and may represent a compound cooling unit. The basal ash flow (unit one) is 330 feet thick and characterized by large flattened pumice fragments in the middle welded zone. Covering the basal ash flow is a 230 foot thick ash flow (unit two) composed of a nonwelded base, a dense vitrophyre, and a thick partly welded upper zone. A third ash flow (unit three) whose maximum thickness is 225 feet overlies unit two and is characterized by extremely flattened pumice fragments and platiness. A fourth ash flow (unit four) found only on Red Mountain overlies unit three and has a maximum thickness of 10 feet. The ash flow tuffs are probably not related to the Canyon Rhyolite of Merriam (1910) and are middle (?) to late Miocene in age. Locally overlying the ash flow tuffs is a thick sequence of varicolored, thickly bedded vitric tuffs. These tuffs are correlated with the Trout Creek Formation on the basis of similar stratigraphic position. Stratigraphically above the Trout Creek Formation is a series of coarse angular conglomerates and fine lacustrine sediments which were deposited in stream channels, and as alluvial fans and slope wash during periods of high stream discharge. These sediments are correlated with the Turn-Turn Conglomerates found on the west side of Pueblo Valley. The Turn-Turn Conglomerates are covered on the west by Pliocene and Pleistocene terrace deposits composed primarily of unconsolidated <b>volcanic</b> <b>gravels</b> and pebbles. Structurally the western half of the thesis area is part of the Pueblo Valley graben while the eastern half forms the Trout Creek Mountains. Most of the faults cut the ash flow tuffs and strike within 30 ° east or west of due north. Donath postulates that this fault pattern may represent original conjugate strike slip shears caused by a north-south maximum principal stress. At a later time block faulting occurred along the previously formed shear zones forming the present topography...|$|R

Mineralogy was determined using XRD. On {{the basis of the}} samples studied, the sediments accumulating in the Atlantis II Fracture Zone are characterized by generally high MgO, Cr, and Ni contents compared with other deep-sea sediments. A variety of sources are reflected in the mineralogy and geochemistry of these sediments. Serpentine, brucite, magnetite, and high MgO, Cr, and Ni contents indicate derivation from ultramafic basement. The occurrence of albite, analcime, primary mafic minerals, and smectite/chlorite in some samples, coupled with high SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, TiO 2, Fe 2 O 3, V, and Y indicate contribution from basaltic basement. A third major sediment source is characterized as biogenic material and is reflected primarily in the presence of carbonate minerals, and high CaO, Sr, Pb, and Zn in certain samples. Kaolinite, illite, quartz, and some chlorite are most likely derived from continental areas or other parts of the ocean by long-distance sediment transport in surface or other ocean currents. Proportions of source materials in the sediments reflect the thickness of the sediment cover, slope of the seafloor, and the nature of and proximity to basement lithologies. REE values are low compared to other deep-sea sediments and indicate no evidence of hydrothermal activity in the Atlantis II Fracture Zone sediments. This is supported by major- and trace-element data...|$|R

40|$|Several {{commercial}} fireclay producing {{areas are}} known in Tōkai region. Among them Iga-Ueno, Shimagahara area in noted as a locality of fireclay such as "Gairome" and "Kibushi" clay in Mie Prefrcture. Iga-Ueno are, west of Ueno city, is mainly composed of sand, silt, clay, <b>volcanic</b> ash and <b>gravel</b> with lignite seams. These constitutents are called Iga clay formation (a {{member of the}} Kobiwako group: Pliocene to Pkeistocene), which is considered as fresh-water sediments in small basin on the basement of granite. Fireclay mined in both Maruyama ansd Kawamoto mines are situated {{in the southern part}} of the Iga-Ueno area. Successional profile to ore deposit and mineralogical compositio have been examined in both mines. In Maruyama, clay formation can be divided into the following three zones from the bed rock of weathered granite to the surface (depth about 20 m) : lower sandy clay, "Kibushi" clay and upper sandy clay. The most upper zone is covered by gravel zone as a role of cap-rock. Also, In Kawamoto, clay formation (about 15 m depth) shows mostly similar tendency of zoning such as: lower sandy clay, "Gairome" and/or "Kibushi" clay and upper sandy clay. The main clay formation of the "Gairome" and "Kibushi" clays are mainly composed of kaolinite and fine grained quartz and feldspar accompained by small amounts of sericite. These clays are considered as residual substances originating from weathered granitic rocks. Several thin white layers (about 20 to 30 cm in width) are intercalated in the upper horizon of sandy clay zones. These are probably originate from the volcanic ash due to their occurrence and mineralogical characters. Further, this white clay minerals: composed of montmorillonite, halloysite, both montmorillonite and halloysite and amorphus. This difference in minerlogy seems to be related to the original source and degree of the weathering process. Crystallinity of kaolinite (Hinckely index value) in clay formation, at Maruyama and Kawamoto deposits fall within the range of 0. 21 - 0. 84 and 0. 29 - 0. 57, respectively. This value shows similar tendency to that of some of the other deposits in same Iga region. Further, the mode of occurrence and mineralogical features of clay formation in this area are mostly similar to those of other various locality of "Kibushi" clay deposits in Tōkai region. 三重県上野盆地周辺地域には愛知県瀬戸、岐阜県土岐・多治見地域とともに多くの耐火粘土鉱床が分布している。当地域の粘土鉱床は、基盤岩である領家花崗岩類の風化砕屑物が基盤の凹地に堆積し粘土化したもので、古琵琶湖層群の最下部に相当する。ここでは、上野盆地西部に位置する丸山・川本鉱山の鉱床の産状および粘土鉱物の性状や、隣接する黒崎鉱山、峰陶土鉱床との対比について述べる。丸山・川本鉱床は砂質粘土を主とし、木節粘土、蛙目粘土、白色粘土などの各層からなり、その最上部を砂礫層が覆っている。両鉱床の砂質・蛙目・木節粘土層の主要鉱物はカオリナイト、石英、長石で、隣接する他地域の黒崎・峰鉱床の構成鉱物組成、化学成分などを比較すると、各鉱床間での大きな差異はみられない。各鉱床に存する白色粘土層は火山灰起源と考えられ、モンモリナイトを主とするもの、ハロイサイトを主とするもの、その両方を含むもの、非晶質物質を主とするものの 4 タイプに分類できる...|$|R
40|$|Around {{the crater}} of Mt. Kusatsu-Shirane, {{located on the}} prefectural {{boundary}} between Nagano and Gunma, a volcanic desert landscape has been formed on fall-out from sporadic volcanic eruptions. This landscape includes the habitat of Vaccinium uliginosum, a wild fruit tree, which is important resource of food for liqueur and jam. On the straight slope near the crater, colluvial loam is exposed and the surface is covered with <b>volcanic</b> sand and <b>gravel</b> which have moved on the slope. These materials show that soil erosion has been caused actively {{up to the present}} in this area. On the other hand, from the plain area to the upper concave slope, a humic horizon is accumulated and an old humic horizon is also recognized under a pumice layer, the surface is covered with a litter layer. The vegetation of this area is distributed in response to these soil materials and landscape features and divided into 5 types as follows: (I) Clumped vegetation composed of small-size (under 2 m 2) colonies of herbs and dwarf shrubs. (II) Clumped vegetation composed of large-size (5 - 10 m 2) colonies of dwarf shrubs. (III) Grassland of Sasa kurilensis including broad-leaved shrubs. (IV) Scrub of needle-leaved trees; herb layer is dominated by Sasa kurtlensis. (V) Coniferous Forest of Abies. spp; herb layer is dominated by Sasa kurilensis. In the volcanic desert (I), the extension of Abies forest and Sasa grassland is disturbed because of inadequate soil. But in the other area, where soil process has advanced to some degree, the accumulation of some humic horizons and the distribution of dead clumps show that this area is former Abies forest area and up to the present destructions and restorations of forest has been repeated several times. Therefore Abies forest and Sasa grassland can extend easily if a volcanic eruption does not occur. V. uliginosum is included in plant communities growing in the transitional zone between the volcanic desert (I) and Sasa grassland (III). In the volcanic desert near the crater a major controlling factor in distribution of V. uliginosum is the soil condition caused by soil erosion. In the other area (III) V. uliginosum habitat is controlled by light intensity and does not extend into the Abies forest and Sasa grassland where shading is sufficient to preclude growth. It is suggested that the erosion factor affects the colony size, the shading affects not only the size but total area. So the change to low light intensity caused by the development of Abies forest and Sasa grassland is disadvantageous to the growth of V. uliginosum which is a pioneer species. Therefore it is concluded that maintenance of the V. uliginosum habitat depends on destruction of the coniferous forest by the volcanic eruption and so this habitat moves as the forest expands and retreats...|$|R
40|$|The newly {{recognized}} Whiteclay Gravel Beds (WGB) of the Miocene Ogallala Group crop {{out as a}} narrow, discontin­uous {{ribbon of}} sands and gravels in Dawes and Sheridan Counties, northwestern Nebraska, USA. The WGB are ex­posed {{in a series of}} municipal gravel quarries and natural exposures that define a linear trench in underlying strata at least 20 m deep and up to 300 m wide, with short, southeast-trending reaches separating generally longer east-trend­ing sections. This gravel-filled trench can be recognized from the Nebraska–South Dakota border near Whiteclay, Ne­braska southeastward to east of Gordon, Nebraska, a distance of 30 km. The outcrop belt of the WGB is coincident in location and trend with the Whiteclay Fault Zone. Where exposed in quarries, the walls of the trench are steep-sided, vertical, or locally overhanging. Polished surfaces, slickensides, and parallel joint sets are common in the walls of the trench near Whiteclay, but uncommon in those to the east. The narrow belt defined by this trench is filled by stratified gravel (3 ̆c 2. 0 m, typically 3 ̆c 0. 3 m) of sedimentary lithologies derived from various Cenozoic units (but prin­cipally Anderson Ranch Formation), and sand. Relatively small amounts of unrounded granitic, <b>volcanic,</b> and quartz <b>gravel</b> are preserved in places. Cross-bedding and clast imbrication indicate paleoflow towards the east. The WGB are interpreted to have formed in response to tectonic upheaval associated with uplift of the Black Hills of South Dakota in Early Miocene times. Fault rupture topography facilitated formation of a steep-sided canyon, or valley, up to 20 m deep, being virtually straight with sharp bends at intervals of several km. An alluvial channel belt developed in the floor of the valley, filling the available accommodation space with coarse sand and gravel via aggra­dational stacking of the deposits of successive channels and channel belts. Channel belts were probably braided, with individual channels up to 4 m deep and a few tens of meters wide. The multi-storey character of the deposit indicates multiple episodes of cutting and filling. The coarse grain-size of the fill suggests energetic discharge with frequent bankfull flows, even though the system had a relatively low gradient (0. 004). An abundance of reworked fossil debris is derived from several stratigraphic units, clasts of which have been identified in the fill. The presence of a contempo­rary merychippine horse and a primitive species of the oreodont Brachycrus constrain formation of the WGB to a short interval within the Early Miocene (c. 17. 5 Ma). The mammal fauna suggests that this stream was a valuable source of water, while fragments of aquatic organisms such as turtles and fish indicate perennial discharge. The WGB provides a crucial window into a pluvial period in the Miocene that is largely unpreserved elsewhere in the basin, facilitated in part by fault rupture topography...|$|R
