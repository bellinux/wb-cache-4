2500|$|The Mustang GT {{featured}} an all-aluminum 4.6L 3-valve SOHC Modular V8 with <b>variable</b> <b>camshaft</b> {{timing and}} a more rugged Tremec TR-3650 transmission. The engine produces 300hp (224kW) @ 5750rpm and 320lb·ft (433N·m) of torque @ 4500rpm. The GT model was capable of performing a quarter-mile test in 13.8 seconds @ 99 MPH, with acceleration from zero to 60 MPH in 5.6 seconds. The Mustang GT also came equipped with a limited slip differential complete with the same carbon-fiber clutch discs used in the 2003 to 2004 SVT Cobra and the 2007 Shelby GT500. The differential uses the 31-spline axles and the [...] ring gear. The standard final drive ratio of 2005 and 2006 Mustang GTs with a manual transmission was 3.55:1. Since the 2007 model year, a 3.31:1 ratio final drive was standard with the 3.55:1 gearing available as a factory installed option. Automatic transmission-equipped models of all years come with 3.31:1 ratio.|$|E

50|$|Chrysler {{has made}} various {{revisions}} to the 5.7 L for the 2009 model year. The first for all applications is what Chrysler calls <b>Variable</b> <b>Camshaft</b> Timing or VCT.

50|$|Honda Marine Group, Mercury Marine, Mercury Racing, Nissan Marine, Suzuki Marine, Tohatsu Outboards, Yamaha Marine, and China Oshen-Hyfong marine {{have all}} {{developed}} new four-stroke engines.

50|$|The 2.0L Zetec Inline-4 {{used in the}} 1998-2003 Ford Escort ZX2, Ford Contour, and 99-02 Mercury Cougar used VCT on {{the exhaust}} camshaft.

In addition, the 1.7L Zetec-S engine found in the European Ford Puma was equipped with <b>variable</b> <b>camshaft</b> timing. The 6.2L V8 introduced in the 2010 SVT Raptor also uses VCT. That motor has a single cam per bank, so it is dual-equal variable cam timing.|$|E
5000|$|Sharing the Ford C1 {{platform}} with the European Ford Focus and the Mazda 3, the V50 featured interior [...] "theatre" [...] lighting, a floating center stack and [...] "Volvo Intelligent Vehicle Architecture".

50|$|For twin cam or DOHC engines, VCT {{was used}} {{on either the}} intake or exhaust camshaft. (Engines that have VCT on both {{camshafts}} are now designated as Ti-VCT.) The use of <b>variable</b> <b>camshaft</b> timing on the exhaust camshaft is for improved emissions, and vehicles with VCT on the exhaust camshaft do not require exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) as retarding the exhaust cam timing achieves the same result. VCT on the intake camshaft is used primarily for increasing engine power and torque as the PCM is able to optimize {{the opening of the}} intake valves to match the engine conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Twin Independent <b>Variable</b> <b>Camshaft</b> Timing (Ti-VCT) is {{the name}} given by Ford to engines {{with the ability to}} advance or retard the timing of both the intake and exhaust {{camshafts}} independently, unlike the original versions of VCT, which only operated on a single camshaft. This allows for improved power and torque, particularly at lower engine RPM, as well as improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. [...] Some Ford Ti-VCT engines use BorgWarner's Cam Torque Actuation (CTA) which utilizes the [...] "existing torsional energy in the valve train to rotate the camshaft" [...] instead of traditional oil pressure driven cam phasing.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2001, Ford's {{in-house}} performance group, Special Vehicle Team (SVT), {{introduced the}} SVT Focus ZX3 to the United States and Canadian markets for the 2002 model year. The exterior included revised {{front and rear}} bumper fascias, side skirts, fog lamps, rear diffuser and 17 in alloy wheels wearing fairly sticky [...] "Y" [...] rated 215/45R17 tires from Continental. The SVT also featured a reworked version of the 2.0-liter Zetec engine available in other Focus models. Developed in concert with Cosworth, this engine featured a special aluminum cylinder head with enlarged intake ports, high compression pistons and forged connecting rods, piston oil squirters, solenoid operated <b>variable</b> <b>camshaft</b> timing on the intake cam, dual stage intake manifold, and a 4-2-1 tubular exhaust header.|$|E
50|$|<b>Variable</b> <b>Camshaft</b> Timing (VCT) is an {{automobile}} {{variable valve timing}} technology developed by Ford. It allows for more optimum engine performance, reduced emissions, and increased fuel efficiency compared to engines with fixed camshafts. It uses electronically controlled hydraulic valves that direct high pressure engine oil into the camshaft phaser cavity. These oil control solenoids are bolted into the cylinder heads towards {{the front of the}} engine near the camshaft phasers. The powertrain control module (PCM) transmits a signal to the solenoids to move a valve spool that regulates the flow of oil to the phaser cavity. The phaser cavity changes the valve timing by rotating the camshaft slightly from its initial orientation, which results in the camshaft timing being advanced or retarded. The PCM adjusts the camshaft timing depending on factors such as engine load and RPM.|$|E
