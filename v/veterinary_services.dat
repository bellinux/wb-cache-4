25|$|The {{escalation}} of the Rhodesian Bush War in the 1970s led to {{a significant amount of}} rural displacement and interrupted agricultural activity. The disruption of <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> resulted in massive livestock losses, and the cultivation of cash crops was hampered by guerrilla raids. The murder of about three hundred white farmers during the war, as well as the conscription of hundreds of others into the Rhodesian Security Forces, also led to a drop in the volume of agricultural production. Between 1975 and 1976 Rhodesia's urban population doubled as thousands of rural dwellers, mostly from TTLs, fled to the cities to escape the fighting. A campaign of systematic villagisation followed as the Rhodesian Army shifted segments of the black population into guarded settlements to prevent their subversion by the insurgents.|$|E

Lamas were incensed over the first issue, which denied that the world was flat; another issue severely criticized the Mongolian nobility for its exploitation of ordinary people. Medical and <b>veterinary</b> <b>services,</b> part of Russian-sponsored reforms, met resistance from the lamas as this had been their prerogative. Mongols regarded as annoying the efforts of the Russians to oversee use of the second loan (the Russians believed the first had been profligately spent) and to reform the state budgetary system. [...] The Russian diplomat Alexander Miller, appointed in 1913, proved to be a poor choice as he had little respect for most Mongolian officials, whom he regarded as incompetent in the extreme. The chief Russian military instructor successfully organized a Mongolian military brigade. Soldiers from this brigade manifested themselves later on in combat against Chinese troops.|$|E

[...] This also began in the 1940s when antibiotics began to be utilized in livestock feed. [...] Perdue is credited as the pioneer of this structure. [...] The basis is centralization of production. [...] ‘Integrators’ control cost, policy, and are the decision makers of production. [...] They decide feed formulations, choice of antibiotic administration, and cover those costs in addition to <b>veterinary</b> <b>services.</b> They also own the poultry that is grown. Farmers are labeled as ‘Growers’ or ‘Operators’. [...] They own the land and buildings where the poultry is grown, and are essentially caretakers for the poultry growth to the Integrators. [...] The benefit for Growers in this business structure is they are guaranteed payment from the Integrators, which is compensated in weight gained by each flock. [...] Due to this structure, about 90% of broilers are raised within 60 miles of the processing plant. [...] Integrators are large poultry companies such as Perdue, Tyson, Pilgrim’s Pride, Koch Foods, etc. [...] There are about 20 of these companies in the U.S. that control 96% of all broilers produced in 2011.|$|E
