MÉTODOS: Foram selecionadas 30 mulheres com sintomas clínicos de candidíase vulvovaginal (15 com cultura de secreção vaginal positiva para C. albicans, 11 com cultura negativa e quatro com cultura positiva para Candida não-albicans) e 12 mulheres controles assintomáticas (nove com cultura negativa). Amostras de soro e lavado vaginal foram obtidas para a detecção de anticorpos anti-C. albicans por ELISA. RESULTADOS: Pacientes sintomáticas com cultura positiva apresentaram níveis de IgA específicas significativamente maiores no lavado vaginal e menores no soro do que aquelas com cultura negativa. Níveis séricos de IgE específica foram extremamente baixos em relação ao lavado vaginal. Altos níveis de IgG total específica foram encontrados no soro e lavado vaginal em ambos os grupos, independente da presença do fungo. Níveis de IgG 1 e IgG 4 específicas foram significativamente maiores somente no lavado vaginal de mulheres sintomáticas e cultura positiva, com relação IgG 1 /IgG 4 ligeiramente maior, indicando que a resposta de anticorpos IgG 1 possa estar predominantemente envolvida na resolução da infecção fúngica. CONCLUSÕES: Nossos resultados indicam resposta acentuada de IgA, IgG 1 e IgG 4 anti-C. albicans no lavado vaginal de mulheres sintomáticas com cultura positiva, sugerindo importante papel destes anticorpos na resposta imune local estimulada pela presença do fungo. PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the levels of}} IgA, IgE, IgG and subclasses (IgG 1, IgG 4) antibodies specific to C. albicans in serum and <b>vaginal</b> <b>washes</b> from women with or without vulvovaginal candidiasis in order to evaluate the role of these antibodies in the immunopathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: Thirty women with clinical symptoms of vulvovaginal candidiasis (15 positive vaginal culture to C. albicans, 11 negative culture and 4 positive culture to non-C. albicans) and 12 asymptomatic control women were selected. Serum and <b>vaginal</b> <b>wash</b> samples were obtained {{for the detection of}} anti-C. albicans antibodies by ELISA. RESULTS: Symptomatic patients with positive culture showed significantly higher levels of specific IgA in <b>vaginal</b> <b>washes</b> and lower in serum than those with negative culture. Specific serum IgE levels were very low compared to vaginal IgE. High levels of total specific IgG were found in serum and <b>vaginal</b> <b>washes</b> in both groups, regardless the fungal presence or absence. Specific IgG 1 e IgG 4 levels were significantly higher only in <b>vaginal</b> <b>washes</b> from symptomatic patients with positive culture, with a slightly higher IgG 1 /IgG 4 ratio, indicating that the IgG 1 antibody response may be predominantly involved in the fungal clearance. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a pronounced antibody response of IgA, IgG 1 and IgG 4 to C. albicans in <b>vaginal</b> <b>washes</b> in symptomatic patients with positive culture, suggesting a important role of these antibodies in the local immune response triggered by the presence of the fungus...|$|R

Lithium, at a concentration of 10 mM, gives the best precision of measurement and has no effect on the results of the immunoassays. In a population of 27 nonpregnant women (age range, 18 to 45 years), the volume of cervicovaginal secretions collected by <b>vaginal</b> <b>washing</b> with 3 ml of LiCl-phosphate-buffered saline was 12 % +/- 3. 2 % (mean +/- standard deviation) of the total volume and showed large interindividual variations (range, 5. 6 to 18. 8 %); the mean dilution factor of a soluble component from the vaginal secretions was 9. 9 % +/- 2. 8 % (range, 6. 3 to 18. 8 %). According to the date of the menstrual cycle, the mean volume of collected cervicovaginal secretions was significantly increased in the luteal phase in comparison with the follicular phase; conversely, the mean dilution factor of a soluble component was more important in the follicular than in the luteal phase.

The one group consisted of 126 pregnant women between 14 and 41 weeks of gestation with the complaint of vaginal fluid leakage. Patients who had positive pooling, nitrazine paper test and fern test were considered as confirmed PROM group (group 1). On the other side, patients with pooling (-) and/or nitrazine paper test (-) and/or fern test (-) were taken as suspected unconfirmed PROM cases (group 2).

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was {{diagnosis}} of premature rupture of membranes in suspected patients by measurement of prolactin and B-hCG levels in <b>vaginal</b> <b>washing</b> in order to reduce perinatal mortality and morbidity. Methods: The study included 211 pregnant women who were referred to the emergency of Imam Hossein hospital at 28 - 38 weeks of pregnancy for leakage or prenatal care from April, 2007 to April, 2008. The expulsion of fluid from the cervix was evaluated and fern and nitrazin tests were done. B-hCG and prolactin levels of <b>vaginal</b> <b>washing</b> fluid were measured. The presence of 2 of 3 parameters of fern test, nitrazin and cervical fluid was defined as absolutely premature rupture of membranes. Mann-Withney U-test was used for analysis. The Roc curve was calculated. Results: There were 132 patients in PROM group and 79 patient in the control group. The average age in the PROM and control groups was 26. 9 ‌± 6. 08 and 26. 2 ± 4. 84 years, respectively(P= 0. 074). Both groups were matched for parity and gravidity. Prolactin levels in PROM group were 2930 ± 3737 mIU/l versus 23. 18 ± 120 mIU/l in the control group (P= 0. 000). B-hCG was 439. 78 ± 1867 mIU/l in PROM and 17. 72 ± 30 mIU/l in control group (p= 0. 000). Sensitivity and specificity of prolactin according to cut-off of 16. 0 mIU/l was 79. 41 % and 96 %, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) is an {{important}} cause of genital ulcers and can increase the risk for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) transmission. Our objective {{was to determine the}} incidence and correlates of HSV- 2 infection in HIV- 1 -seronegative Kenyan men reporting high-risk sexual behavior, compared with high-risk HIV- 1 -seronegative women in the same community. METHODS: Cohort participants were screened for prevalent HIV- 1 infection. HIV- 1 -uninfected participants had regularly scheduled follow-up visits, with HIV counseling and testing and collection of demographic and behavioral data. Archived blood samples were tested for HSV- 2. RESULTS: HSV- 2 prevalence was 22. 0 % in men and 50. 8 % in women (P < 0. 001). HSV- 2 incidence in men was 9. 0 per 100 person-years, and was associated with incident HIV- 1 infection (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR], 3. 9; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 3 - 12. 4). Use of soap for genital washing was protective (aIRR, 0. 3; 95 % CI, 0. 1 - 0. 8). Receptive anal intercourse had a borderline association with HSV- 2 acquisition in men (aIRR, 2. 0; 95 % CI, 1. 0 - 4. 1; P = 0. 057), and weakened the association with incident HIV- 1. Among women, HSV- 2 incidence was 22. 1 per 100 person-years (P < 0. 001 compared with incidence in men), and was associated with incident HIV- 1 infection (aIRR, 8. 9; 95 % CI, 3. 6 - 21. 8) and <b>vaginal</b> <b>washing</b> with soap (aIRR, 1. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 0 - 3. 4).

Conversely, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-/- mice failed to resolve infection, and CD 4 -/- mice showed a significant delay (2 weeks). Secondary challenge of C 57 BL/ 6, beta 2 m-/-, and CD 4 -/- mice established that acquired protective immunity, which was characterized by an infection of shortened duration and reduced shedding of infectious organisms, developed. Serological analysis of C 57 BL/ 6 and beta 2 m-/- mice by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed no striking differences in the immunoglobulin subclass specificity of the anti-Chlamydia response, although some differences were observed in {{the magnitude of the}} immunoglobulin G 2 a (IgG 2 a) and IgG 2 b responses. Class II-/- mice produced lower-titered serum anti-Chlamydia antibodies of all isotypes. The serum antibody responses of CD 4 -/- mice were similar to those of C 57 BL/ 6 mice, except that the anti-Chlamydia IgA response was delayed by approximately 3 weeks. Analysis of <b>vaginal</b> <b>washes</b> for Chlamydia-reactive antibodies revealed the presence of IgG 2 a, IgG 2 b, and IgA in C 57 BL/ 6 and beta 2 m-/- mice and primarily of IgA in CD 4 -/- mice. <b>Vaginal</b> <b>washes</b> from class II-/- mice were consistently antibody negative. Interestingly, the Chlamydia-specific IgA response in the <b>vaginal</b> <b>washes</b> of CD 4 -/- mice was delayed, but its appearance coincided with decreased shedding of infectious organisms and resolution of infection.

Therefore, we assessed vaginal GBS and E. coli carriage rates and risk factors and the GBS serotype distribution in three sub-Saharan countries. A total of 430 women from Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa were studied cross-sectionally. Vaginal carriage of GBS and E. coli, and GBS serotype were assessed using molecular techniques. Risk factors for carriage were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Vaginal carriage rates in reference groups from Kenya and South Africa were 20. 2 % (95 % CI, 13. 7 - 28. 7 %) and 23. 1 % (95 % CI, 16. 2 - 31. 9 %), respectively for GBS; and 25. 0 % (95 % CI, 17. 8 - 33. 9 %) and 27. 1 % (95 % CI, 19. 6 - 36. 2 %), respectively for E. coli. GBS serotypes Ia (36. 8 %), V (26. 3 %) and III (14. 0 %) were most prevalent.

Anti-gB IgA titers in <b>vaginal</b> <b>washes</b> were significantly higher during estrus than diestrus or proestrus, whereas specific IgG titers were significantly higher during diestrus than estrus. This was further demonstrated in hormone-treated mice, where progesterone administration induced a diestrus-like state that resulted in elevated specific IgG-to-IgA ratios. Interestingly, unimmunized mice were only susceptible to intravaginal (ivag) infection with HSV- 2 during diestrus. Mice immunized i. n. with AdgB 8 and given progesterone were protected from a lethal intravaginal HSV- 2 challenge, despite the fact that virus replication was present for 4 days postchallenge.

The CP 30 band is a cysteine proteinase because its activity was inhibited by E- 64, a thiol proteinase inhibitor. In two-dimensional substrate gel electrophoresis of total extracts of the trichomonad isolate CNCD 147, three spots with proteolytic activity were detected in the 30 -kDa region, in the pI range from 4. 5 to 5. 5. Two of the spots (pI 4. 5 and 5. 0) bound to the surfaces of fixed HeLa cells corresponding to the CP 30 band. The immunoglobulin G fraction of the rabbit anti-CP 30 antiserum that recognized a 30 -kDa band by Western blotting and immunoprecipitated CP 30 specifically inhibited trichomonal cytoadherence to HeLa cell monolayers in a concentration-dependent manner and reacted with CP 30 at the parasite surface. CP 30 degraded proteins found on the female urogenital tract, including fibronectin, collagen IV, and hemoglobin. Interestingly, CP 30 digested fibronectin and collagen IV only at pH levels between 4. 5 and 5. 0. Moreover, trichomonosis patients whose diagnosis was confirmed by in vitro culture possessed antibody to CP 30 in both sera and <b>vaginal</b> <b>washes,</b> and CP 30 activity was found in <b>vaginal</b> <b>washes.</b> Our results suggest that surface CP 30 is a cysteine proteinase necessary for trichomonal adherence to human epithelial cells...|$|R

Seventy days following primary infection, mice were rechallenged to assess acquired immunity. B-cell-deficient mice which lack anti-Chlamydia antibodies were more susceptible to reinfection than immunocompetent C 57 BL/ 6 mice. However, acquired immune resistance was evident in both strains of mice and characterized by decreased shedding of chlamydiae and an infection of shorter duration. Thus, this study demonstrates that cell-mediated immune responses alone were capable of resolving chlamydial infection; however, in the absence of specific antibody, mice were more susceptible to reinfection. Therefore, these data suggest that both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses were important mediators of immune protection in this model, though cell-mediated immune responses appear to play a more dominant role...|$|R

At baseline, vaginal practices were commonly reported: <b>vaginal</b> <b>washing</b> (82. 77 %), wiping (56. 47 %) and insertion of dry or absorbent materials (20. 58 %). All three practices decreased during the trial. However, women in the intervention group {{were significantly more likely to}} report washing or wiping during follow-up compared to those in the control group. Additionally, washing, wiping, and insertion, were all independently and inversely associated with consistent diaphragm and gel use and with condom use as well, regardless of study arm. A better understanding of the socio-cultural context in which these practices are embedded could improve educational strategies to address these potentially modifiable behaviors, and may benefit future HIV prevention interventions of vaginal methods...|$|E
40|$|Two commercially {{available}} hypersensitive assays for {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA quantitation, AMPLICOR HIV- 1 Monitor Test 1. 5 and Quantiplex HIV RNA 3. 0, were compared to detect and quantify HIV- 1 RNA in the cell-free fraction of cervicovaginal secretions collected by <b>vaginal</b> <b>washing.</b> Three panel specimens were used: pooled cervicovaginal secretions spiked with HIV- 1 subtype A or HIV- 1 subtype B and cervicovaginal lavages from HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. Compared to the AMPLICOR HIV- 1 Monitor Test 1. 5 assay, the Quantiplex HIV- 1 3. 0 assay yielded higher estimates of HIV- 1 RNA concentrations in several tested samples spiked with HIV- 1 RNA subtype A, as well as subtype B, particularly samples containing low amounts of HIV- 1 RNA. The sensitivity and specificity of the AMPLICOR HIV- 1 Monitor Test 1. 5 assay were 93 and 100 %, respectively; the sensitivity and specificity of the Quantiplex HIV RNA 3. 0 assay were 97 and 50 %, respectively. In conclusion, in quantifying HIV- 1 RNA in cervicovaginal secretions, the Quantiplex HIV RNA 3. 0 may lack specificity, and the AMPLICOR HIV- 1 Monitor Test 1. 5 assay, although highly specific, may lack sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in <b>vaginal</b> <b>washing</b> fluid (VWF) in women with a history of recurrent and/or treatment resistant vaginitis. Methods:This prospective case control study was conducted in the gynecology clinic of the current hospital. A total of 64 women (33 with a history of recurrent and/or treatment resistant vaginitis as study group and 31 healthy women as control group) were enrolled in the study. The recorded parameters were; age, presenting symptom, educational level, socioeconomic status, fre quency of vaginal douching (VD), peripheral blood leukocyte count, CRP levels in VWF, vaginal culture, fresh vaginal smear and urinalysis. Results: The study group had statistically significantly lower educational level and socioeconomic status than the control group (p< 0. 05). The mean levels of peripheral blood leukocyte count and leukocyte count on the fresh vaginal smear, leukocyturia and VWF CRP levels were statistically significantly higher in the study group (p< 0. 05). In patients who had ≥ 3 times a week VD had also statistically significantly higher VWF CRP levels (p= 0. 012). Conclusion:According to this study, recurrent and/or treatment resistant vaginitis is more common in women who have lower socioeconomic status/educational level and who perform more frequently VD, and VWF CRP levels may be a good marker for the diagnosis of disease.

40|$|Neisseria gonorrhoeae surface protein A (NspA) is {{a highly}} conserved gonococcal antigen. To explore the {{potential}} of NspA in vaccine development against gonorrhea, BALB/c mice were immunized with pcNspA containing the NspA gene from N. gonorrhoeae strain WHO-A via intramuscular (i. m.) injection, intranasal (i. n.) immunization, or intravaginal (i. vag.) immunization. Following the last DNA immunization, mice were boosted with recombinant NspA (rNspA). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) indicated that all immunized mice generated measurable NspA-specific IgG and IgA in serum and secretory IgA (sIgA) in <b>vaginal</b> <b>wash</b> fluids. The antisera had bactericidal and opsonic activities. These data demonstrated that NspA induced antibodies with antigonococcal activity...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{attempts}} to induce mucosal antibodies in rhesus monkeys by enteric immunization {{have resulted in}} only modest and short-lived responses, dominated by immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies in the plasma. In this study, two groups of rhesus monkeys were immunized intranasally three times at 2 -week intervals with a bacterial protein antigen (AgI/II) either chemically coupled to or mixed with the B subunit of cholera toxin (CT), a known potent mucosal immunogen and carrier for other immunogens. Cells secreting antibodies, predominantly of the IgA isotype, to AgI/II and to CT were detected in the peripheral blood 1 week after each immunization, indicating the dissemination of IgA-secreting precursor cells through the mucosal immune system. IgG and, to a lesser extent, IgA antibodies to both proteins were induced in the plasma commencing after the second immunization. Plasma IgE concentrations and IgE antibody levels were not consistently raised during the immunization period. IgA antibodies were found in nasal and <b>vaginal</b> <b>washes.</b> Nasal IgG but not IgA antibodies showed a significant positive correlation with plasma IgG antibody levels, suggesting that they were largely derived by transudation from the circulation. Analysis of the molecular form of vaginal IgA indicated that both secretory and monomeric forms of IgA were present in various proportions. Furthermore, neither IgG nor IgA antibodies in <b>vaginal</b> <b>washes</b> were correlated with plasma antibody responses, suggesting the contribution of locally synthesized antibodies of both isotypes. Comparison of the responses {{between the two groups}} of animals showed only sporadic significant differences, indicating that intranasal immunization with AgI/II either coupled to or mixed with the B subunit of CT was equally effective at inducing generalized IgA antibody responses in the mucosal immune system and predominantly IgG antibodies in the plasma...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Resistant Trichomonas vaginalis {{infection}} is typically treated with increased doses of oral metronidazole. Because {{of side effects}} that limit compliance, such treatment may be ineffective. CASE: A young woman had an 8 -year history of T vaginalis that was refractory to multiple courses of metronidazole, tinidazole and intravaginal paromomycin. After microscopic examination confirmed trichomonads, she began an extended, 14 -day course of combined oral and vaginal metronidazole. Six weeks later her symptoms were unchanged, but microscopy revealed fewer trichomonads. After a 5 % acetic acid <b>vaginal</b> <b>wash</b> and dilute silver nitrate bladder instillation, she was given the same treatment for 21 days. Symptoms and trichomonads resolved, and 3 years later she remained asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Prolonged vaginal and oral metronidazole, in combination with bladder and vaginal irrigation, {{should be considered in}} women with refractory T vaginalis...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To monitor yeasts {{isolated}} from women during and between episodes of recurrent vulvo-vaginal candidosis (VVC) {{to determine whether}} vaginal relapse or re-infection occurred. METHODS:Women presenting at the genitourinary medicine clinic with {{signs and symptoms of}} VVC were recruited to the study (n = 121). A <b>vaginal</b> <b>washing,</b> high vaginal swab (HVS) and rectal swab were taken and the women treated with a single 500 mg clotrimazole pessary. Women were asked to re-attend after 1, 4, and 12 weeks, or when the VVC recurred, when vaginal washings and HVS were repeated. Candida isolates recovered were strain typed using the Ca 3 probe and their similarity assessed. Antifungal susceptibility to fluconazole and clotrimazole were determined. RESULTS: Of the women recruited, 47 completed the study, either returning for four visits or suffering a recurrence during the study period. Of the 22 women who experienced recurrence, the same strain was responsible for the initial and recurrent episode in 17 women. For the remaining five women, four had strain replacement and one had a change of species. None of the isolates recovered from the women demonstrated resistance to either clotrimazole or fluconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the theory of vaginal relapse and thus may support the use of more prolonged courses of antifungal therapy initially to increase the chances of eradication of the yeast...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of traces of semen in cervicovaginal secretions (CVS) from sexually active women practicing unprotected {{sex is a}} prerequisite for the accurate study of cervicovaginal immunity. Two semen markers, the prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) and the Y chromosome, were detected in parallel in CVS obtained by a standardized <b>vaginal</b> <b>washing</b> of consecutive women attending the principal medical center for sexually transmitted diseases of Bangui, Central African Republic. PSA was detected by immunoenzymatic capture assay in the cell-free fraction of CVS, and the Y chromosome was detected by a single PCR assay of DNA extracted by silica from the cell fraction (Y PCR). Fifty (19 %) cell-free fractions of the 264 β-globin-positive CVS samples were positive for PSA, and 100 (38 %) cell fractions of the CVS samples were positive for the Y chromosome. All the 50 (19 %) PSA-containing CVS samples were also positive for the Y chromosome. Fifty (19 %) CVS samples were positive only for the Y chromosome, with no detectable PSA. The remaining 164 (62 %) CVS samples were both PSA and Y chromosome negative. These findings demonstrate that CVS from sexually active women may contain cell-associated semen residues unrecognized by conventional immunoenzymatic assays used to detect semen components. The {{detection of}} cell-associated male DNA with a highly sensitive and specific procedure such as Y PCR constitutes a method of choice to detect semen traces in female genital secretions...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Diagnosis of {{premature}} rupture of membranes (PROM) is difficult in equivocal cases with traditional methods. This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} reliability of <b>vaginal</b> <b>washing</b> fluid urea and creatinine for diagnosis of PROM and to determine the cut off value. Materials and methods: The current study was a prospective case control. Women having gestational age of 28 to 42 weeks {{were divided into two}} equal groups: Fifty with history of leaking per vagina (study group) and an equal number with gestation matched none leaking (control group) were recruited. Data analysis was done by Student’s t-test, receiver operator curve and chi square test. Results: The demographic data of both groups were comparable at the time of sampling (p > 0. 05). Vaginal fluid urea and creatinine was significantly higher in study group (p 6 mg/dl and creatinine with a cut off value of > 0. 3 mg/dl to diagnose PROM were all more than 90 %. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of amniotic fluid index (AFI) to diagnose PROM were 30 %, 91. 8 %, 83. 33 %, 57. 32 % and 62 % respectively, with a cut-off value of ≤ 7 cm. The areas under the curves are 0. 952 for creatinine, 0. 999 for urea and 0. 635 for AFI. Conclusion: Detection of vaginal fluid urea and creatinine to diagnose PROM is a simple, reliable and rapid test. Introduction of this method into routine use even in low resource community setting is feasible, practical and cost effective. </div...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{complement}} in human menstrual blood and cervical mucus to kill Trichomonas vaginalis was {{compared with that}} of complement in serum, and 95 fresh trichomonal isolates obtained from <b>vaginal</b> <b>wash</b> material were evaluated for susceptibility to complement immediately after isolation. Only serum and menstrual blood with haemolytic activity produced total cytolysis of T vaginalis. The cytolytic abilities of these fluids were totally inactivated by treatment with heat or edetic acid (EDTA), which confirms the role of complement in cytolysis. Most cervical mucus samples had no detectable trichomonal cytotoxic properties. The cytotoxic activity in the remaining samples was not due to complement, as it was heat stable. Fresh isolates of T vaginalis and subpopulations of fresh isolates differed in their susceptibility or resistance to complement mediated lysis in serum. Resistance to complement did not remain stable after trichomonads were grown in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Depo-Provera (Depo) is a long-acting progestational {{formulation}} that is {{a popular}} form of contraception for women. In animal models of sexually transmitted diseases, {{it is used to}} facilitate infection. Here we report that treatment with Depo, in a mouse model of genital herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2), altered immune responses depending on the length of time that animals were exposed to Depo prior to immunization. Mice immunized intravaginally (i. vag.) with an attenuated strain (TK−) of HSV- 2 following longer (15 days) exposure to Depo (Depo 15 group) failed to show protection when challenged with wild-type HSV- 2. In contrast, mice that were immunized shortly after Depo treatment (5 days; Depo 5 group) were fully protected and showed no genital pathology after HSV- 2 challenge. High viral titers were detected in the <b>vaginal</b> <b>washes</b> of the Depo 15 group up to 6 days postchallenge. In contrast, no viral shedding was observed beyond day 3 postchallenge in the Depo 5 group. Following i. vag. TK− immunization, high levels of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) were detected locally in <b>vaginal</b> <b>washes</b> of the Depo 5 group but not the Depo 15 group. After HSV- 2 challenge, an early peak of IFN-γ in the Depo 5 group coincided with clearance of the virus. In Depo 15 animals IFN-γ was present throughout the 6 days postinfection. HSV- 2 -specific T-cell cytokine responses measured in the lymph node cells of Depo 5 TK−-immunized mice indicated a significantly higher Th 1 response than that of Depo 15 TK−-immunized mice. The protection after HSV- 2 challenge in the Depo 5 group correlated with increased local HSV- 2 glycoprotein B (gB) -specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA responses seen in the vaginal secretions. The Depo 15 group had poor gB-specific antibody responses in the genital tract after HSV- 2 challenge. These results indicate that longer exposure to Depo leads to poor innate and adaptive immune responses to HSV- 2 that fail to protect mice from subsequent genital challenges...|$|R
