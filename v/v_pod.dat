Minica # 4 (Vigna unguiculata L.) on an Arenic Paleudult (Acrisol) was evaluated {{in an alley}} cropping experiment with Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp., Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and a treeless control during a short- (November-December 2004), and long-(May-June 2005) rainy season at Ebini, Guyana. The alley cropping treatments had no significant effect on cowpea plant height, pods per plant, pod weight per plant and grain weight. During the short-rainy season, values for cowpea plant height and number of pods per plant were higher compared to those for the long-rainy season, and number of pods per plant {{was positively correlated with}} pod weight. During the long-rainy season, pod weight and grain weight were correspondingly higher. Plant height <b>vs.</b> number of <b>pods</b> per plant; number of <b>pods</b> per plant <b>vs.</b> <b>pod</b> weight; and, number of <b>pods</b> per plant <b>vs.</b> grain weight, were all posi-tively correlated.

40|$|As a {{well-established}} technique for postoperative pain relief, {{the benefits of}} epidural analgesia (EDA) have been under debate recently. This study aimed to determine whether EDA could improve perioperative outcomes and survival in patients undergoing esophagectomy. From January 2010 to December 2012, 587 consecutive cases undergoing McKeown-type esohpageactomy were retrospectively identified from a prospectively maintained database. After propensity-matching, incorporating baseline characteristics, 178 cases were included in each group, and patients characteristics distributions were well-balanced between two groups. Compared with intravenous analgesia, the use of EDA significantly decreased the incidence of pneumonia from 32 % to 19. 7 % (P = 0. 008), and anastomotic leakage from 23. 0 % to 14. 0 % (P = 0. 029). The change in CRP level of EDA group was significantly decreased (preoperative, 6. 2 <b>vs.</b> 6. 2; <b>POD</b> 1, 108. 1 <b>vs.</b> 121. 3; <b>POD</b> 3, 131. 5 <b>vs.</b> 137. 8; <b>POD</b> 7, 69. 3 vs. 82. 1 mg/L; P = 0. 044).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study whether {{bacterial}} translocation is {{more prevalent}} after small-bowel transplantation with systemic venous drainage (SVD) vs portal venous drainage (PVD) {{and whether it}} is influenced by immunosuppression. DESIGN: We performed 15 small-bowel transplantations in pigs. Group 1 (n = 5) had SVD and no immunosuppression; group 2 (n = 6), PVD and no immunosuppression; and group 3 (n = 4), PVD and immunosuppression with tacrolimus and methylprednisolone sodium succinate. Portal and systemic blood, portal and mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver were cultured in donors and recipients on postoperative day 0 (POD 0) and in recipients on postoperative day 3 (POD 3). Jejunal and ileal contents were also sampled at these times. SUBJECTS: Outbred male Yorkshire-Landrace pigs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Blood and tissue bacterial cultures, (2) blood endotoxin levels, and (3) histopathologic examination. RESULTS: Cultures were positive for bacteria in 32 % (16 / 50) of samples on POD 0 and 88 % (22 / 25) on POD 3 in group 1, in 18 % (11 / 60) of samples on POD 0 and 97 % (29 / 30) on POD 3 in group 2, and in 8 % (3 / 40) of samples on POD 0 and 95 % (19 / 20) on POD 3 in group 3. Systemic blood cultures were positive for bacteria on POD 3 in 60 % (3 / 5) of pigs in group 1, 83 % (5 / 6) in group 2, and 100 % (4 / 4) in group 3. Significantly more bacteria {{were present in the}} ileum than in the jejunum on POD 0 in group 2; this difference approached significance in groups 1 and 3. Bacterial numbers were identical in the ileum and jejunum by POD 3 in all groups. Circulating endotoxin levels were significantly elevated on <b>POD</b> 3 <b>vs</b> <b>POD</b> 0 only in group 1. Endotoxin levels were not significantly different between the SVD group (group 1) and either PVD group (groups 2 and 3). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial translocation is prevalent after small-bowel transplantation in pigs whether PVD or SVD is used. Immunosuppression with tacrolimus does not prevent bacterial translocation but may reduce systemic endotoxemia. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Woody plant {{encroachment}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} problems worldwide because it affects negatively the herbaceous layer, which provide forage for livestock production. However, the role of ruminants particularly browsers in the dispersal of woody plant seeds still remains a concern for farmers interested in grass production. Seedpods of various woody plant species constitute a crucial part of the diet of herbivores during the dry season because of their high nutritional quality compared to herbaceous material. The interaction of associated diet quality, seed characteristics and animal species among other factors play a pivotal part in the success of livestock faecal seeds dispersion. Furthermore, dispersed seeds that successfully grow into mature woody plants become an important source of protein for herbivores. The use of woody plants as a source forage is known to be limited by plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) such as condensed tannins. The objectives of this study were to determine 1) the effects of condensed tannins and crude protein of Vachellia tortilis and Dichrostachys cinerea pods in seed recovery and germination fed to goats, and 2) the effects of diet mixing on the feed intake of plant species by goats. In the first experiment, a total of 12 female indigenous goats and 12 female Pedi sheep were utilised in this study, with the average body weights of 29. 50 kg ± 1. 60 (S. E) and 28. 70 kg ± 1. 60, respectively. Twelve goats were grouped into two groups of six goats per group, one group was fed D. cinerea pods and the other group was fed <b>V.</b> tortilis <b>pods.</b> The group of 12 sheep were divided similarly, the one group was fed D. cinerea pods and the other group was fed <b>V.</b> tortilis <b>pods.</b> Each animal was given V. tortilis and D. cinerea pods at 2. 50 % of their body weight. All animals were allowed to consume D. cinerea or <b>V.</b> tortilis <b>pods</b> within 24 h, after which the remaining pods were collected and weighed. Faecal collection commenced immediately after the 24 h pods feeding and was carried on until no seeds were discovered in faeces. All faeces extracted from sheep and goats were collected daily in the morning from the faecal bags. In the second experiment, a total of 24 indigenous goats with average body weight of 26. 6 kg ± 0. 51 were utilised. Goats were arbitrarily selected and grouped into four groups of six goats per group (goats were placed individually in 2 m 2 pens). Each group was fed one of the following diets: diet one - Searsia lancea, diet two - S. pyroides, diet three - Euclea crispa and diet four - was a combination of the three plant species (Searsia lancea, S. pyroides and Euclea crispa). Searsia lancea, S. pyroides and E. crispa branches were collected every morning prior to feeding, and were weighed before offering the animals. Refusals were gathered and weighed, and intake was calculated as distinction between weight in and refusals. Plant species foliage were analysed for crude protein, condensed tannin, acid detergent lignin, acid detergent fibre and neutral detergent fibre. During the first experiment, the cumulative percentage seed recovery of V. tortilis from goats (46. 00 % ± 1. 90) and sheep (52. 00 % ± 2. 93) was significantly higher than D. cinerea from goats (13 % ± 1. 47) and sheep (24. 00 % ± 1. 16). Germination percentage of D. cinerea seeds that passed through the gastro-intestinal tract of goats (33. 12 % ± 2. 94) and sheep (36. 00 % ± 2. 68) was significantly higher than V. tortilis seeds that passed through the gastro-intestinal tract of goats (28. 98 % ± 2. 68) and sheep (23. 04 % ± 2. 81). Average D. cinerea (34. 56 % ± 1. 99) and V. tortilis (26. 02 %± 2. 10) seeds that went through the gastro-intestinal of goats and sheep had a significantly higher germination rate than the control (i. e. no passage through the gut; D. cinerea = 2. 31 % ± 1. 55, V. tortilis = 5. 07 % ± 2. 68). The high mean cumulative percentage seed recovery of V. tortilis (18. 80 %) may be attributed to the relatively higher crude protein than D. cinerea (12. 20 %). This may encourage animal seed dispersal and germination of woody plant species with relatively high crude protein content. In the second experiment, Searsia lancea contained 8. 50 % CP, 21. 46 % acid detergent fibre (ADF), 12. 50 % ADL and 39. 37 % NDF. Searsia pyroides had 9. 03 % CP, 27. 07 % ADF, 10. 89 % ADL and 40. 30 % NDF. Euclea crispa had 6. 19 % CP, 26. 20 % ADF, 16. 63 % ADL and 30. 02 % NDF. Mixed diet (combination of the three plant species) had 8. 96 % CP, 23. 72 % ADF, 11. 13 % ADL and 38. 28 % NDF. Searsia lancea had 2. 70 % of CTs while S. pyroides had 5. 20 % CT, E. crispa had 6. 44 % CT and mixed diet had 7. 20 % CT. The mean dry matter intake varied significantly among dietary groups (P < 0. 001). Similarly, goats offered a mixed diet consumed more CTs (P < 0. 01) than those offered individual forage species. The high mean cumulative percentage seed recovery of V. tortilis may be attributed to the higher crude protein of V. tortilis (18. 80 %) than D. cinerea (12. 20 %). Higher passage rate may encourage animal seed dispersal and germination of plant species. The results from experiment two support the postulation that animals foraging in mixed diet systems consume more PSMs and achieve higher dry matter intake than animals confined to monocultures or single species feeding systems. Given that woody plant encroachment is already reducing farm-grazing capacities in African savannas and this problem is predicted to double by 2050, strategies that improve herbivore ability to consume woody plants will increase forage availability and inform bush control programmes and policies. Moreover, the concomitant increase in CTs by goats exposed to diets with diverse species also has positive implications for animalAgriculture, Animal Health and Human EcologyM. Sc.

The canal is almost empty most of the time, but in case of heavy rainfall, the stream floods the road under which it flows. The reason of flooding is the inlet of the culvert under the road. The following sections, the problematic section of the stream and the proposed solutions are described. The basic idea is to hold the water as upstream as possible and locally restrict the downstream flow to the limit of the culvert acceptance. The gathered data on the stream as well as maximum rainfall data have been used to define the surface runoff for each tributary of the stream for 5 -, 10 - and 50 -year rainfall extremes. After calculation of maximum inlet flow into the road culvert, the amount of excessive water to run into the designed flooding area is calculated.

As this question has never been assessed, we evaluated two diets: a) mature soybean pods (dried shell + dried soybean seeds) and b) dried soybean seeds for the two bugs by assessing their biological, behavioral, and morphological attributes on each diet in laboratory. While nymphs of both species were able to develop and adults able to reproduce on the tested diets, bugs fed on pods had longer development times and 2. 2 to 5. 0 times higher mortality rates than bugs fed on seeds. Furthermore, adult longevity of R. pedestris and H. halys fed on pods was 8. 4 and 7. 5 days shorter, respectively, than that of bugs fed on seeds. However, pod feeding {{had no effect on}} adult fecundity or egg viability. In a behavioral choice test, adult R. pedestris preferred seeds over pods and probed seeds longer than pods. On average, adult H. halys also preferred seeds over pods, although 15. 6 % of H. halys showed the reverse, preferring pods over seeds. The proboscis length and estimated depth of stylet penetration into the host tissue of both nymphs and adults of both species was much greater than the thickness of the pod shell, suggesting that mouthpart structure does not explain the negative effects of <b>pods</b> <b>vs.</b> seeds. In conclusion, mature soybean pods were found to be a suitable food source for both R. pedestris and H. halys despite some negative effects, and thus careful attention should be paid to the population levels of these two bugs approaching harvest to reduce economic damage in soybean...|$|R

Efekt PA pobytových kurzů v přírodě (adaptační kurz GO! <b>v</b> Hynčicích <b>pod</b> Sušinou, kurz pobytu v letní přírodě v Lipnici nad Sázavou a škola v přírodě ve Volyni) byl u žen (n = 49) a mužů (n = 27) posuzován srovnáním s jejich habituální týdenní PA realizovanou tři týdny po skončení pobytových kurzů v přírodě. PA byla monitorována prostřednictvím akcelerometru Caltrac, pedometru Omron a individuálního záznamu. PA byla hodnocena podle aktivního energetického výdeje (Caltrac), počtu kroků (Omron) a doby trvání PA (individuální záznam). Na všech analyzovaných pobytových kurzech v přírodě splňuje objem PA epidemiologická doporučení k upevnění zdraví. Svým obsahem a formami její provádění také smazává rozdíly mezi PA děvčat a chlapců a PA ve víkendových a pracovních dnech. PA ve škole v přírodě ve Volyni a na kurzu pobytu v letní přírodě v Lipnici nad Sázavou je navíc u děvčat i chlapců výrazným stimulem pro rozvoj tělesné zdatnosti. Výrazný vliv "intervenční" PA na habituální PA byl prokázán u děvčat (rP = 0. 55) i chlapců (rP = 0. 60) ze školy v přírodě ve Volyni a střední efekt (rP = 0. 39) u děvčat z adaptačního kurzu GO!. The main aim of {{this study}} is to {{ascertain}} the effect of physical activity (hereafter PA) of residential camps in nature on habitual weekly PA and to compare the level of performed PA to health epidemiological recommendations. The effect of females' (n = 49) and males' (n = 27) PA at residential camps (the experiential camp GO! in Hynčice pod Sušinou, the residential camp in Lipnice nad Sázavou and the school in nature in Volyně) was assessed by comparing it to their habitual weekly PA, performed at a three-week interval after the end of these camps. PA was monitored using the accelerometer Caltrac, the pedometer Omron and individual records. PA was assessed by active energy expenditure (Caltrac), number of steps (Omron) and time of PA (individual record). At every analysed residential camp in nature, the volume of PA meets the epidemiological recommendations for strengthening health. The content and form of PA at residential camps in nature also erases differences between females’ and males’ PA and weekend and working days. PA performed at the school in nature in Volyně and at the residential camp in Lipnice provided a strong impulse for the development of fitness in males and females. We showed the strong effect of "interventional" PA on habitual weekly PA in both females (rP = 0. 55) and males (rP = 0. 60) at the school in nature in Volyně and a moderate effect on females (rP = 0. 39) at the experiential camp GO!...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for integrating probabilistic fracture mechanics with quantitative NDT {{for the purpose}} of failure risk assessment in load-carrying elements under fatigue circumstances. The definition of the failure risk of structural components is made {{in the context of the}} general approach of structural reliability with a discussion of the sources of uncertainties and variability encountered in the assessment. The quality of NDT is accounted by the probability of detection (POD) as function of the flaw size. The main focus is placed on the presentation on the fatigue failure risk assessment in conjunction with the quality and timing of the envisaged non-destructive inspection. On the base of Monte Carlo computer simulation, a rationale have been developed encompassing the fatigue crack growth under short- and long-crack regime, thus addressing the entire fatigue life. For this purpose, the concepts of "initial fictitious crack" size and "equivalent initial flaw" size are discussed and implemented in the analysis. By computer simulation, it is exemplified, for a notched member of an aluminum alloy, the modeling of the scatter of the total fatigue life and the scatter of the crack size at a given life. Further, by fitting the simulated random data into continuous statistical distributions enabled to model the key distributions involved in the failure risk assessment. Finally, the probability of failure, at a specific timing during the fatigue life, is estimated by Monte Carlo simulation of the failure on the base of Failure Analysis Diagram (FAD) approach. The benefit of applying a non-destructive inspection technique, qualified by a specific POD dependence on the crack size, is demonstrated by evincing the decrease in the predicted failure probability. Bootstrap techniques are also exemplified for constructing confidence intervals on <b>POD</b> <b>vs.</b> crack size. The integration of quantitative NDT with probabilistic fracture mechanics, in order to evince the failure risk, enables a better timing and ranking of inspection procedures...|$|R

40|$|Probabilistic {{methods for}} failure risk {{assessment}} are introduced, {{with reference to}} load carrying structures, such as pressure vessels (PV) and components of pipes systems. The definition of the failure risk associated with structural integrity {{is made in the}} context of the general approach to structural reliability. Sources of risk are summarily outlined with emphasis on variability and uncertainties (V&U) which might be encountered in the analysis. To highlight the problem, in its practical and analysis perspective, a short account is given on the nature of failures encountered in pressure vessels and pipe systems, with essential statistical data of service failure. Two engineering analysis tools are invoked: probabilistic fracture mechanics (PFM) and quantitative non-destructive inspection (QNDI). Probabilistic models for risk estimation, in terms of failure probability, are introduced in the classical view of full distribution approach (convolution integral computation) and direct Monte Carlo random simulation of the governing input variables implied in the failure model. The considered end-failure criterion operates with a performance function derived from the elastic-plastic Dugdale crack model, formalized in the failure assessment diagram (FAD) methodology. In the analysis are also integrated probability of detection (POD) models which quantify the chance of flaws/cracks detection by non-destructive inspection, applied intermittently or continuously in a structural health monitoring (SHM) system. he technique of construction of nonparametric confidence intervals on <b>POD</b> <b>vs.</b> crack size rule, by simulated bootstrap re-sampling is presented, in view of setting, presumably safe initial crack size used in fracture mechanics computations. By merging PFM and QNDI via POD, the benefit of applying non-destructive inspection for the purpose of increasing structural reliability is estimated in terms of the decrease of failure probability. The influence of the quality of non-destructive inspection is reflected by POD rule (model). The quantitative approach, structured as a computer code pvRISK is provided. A case study of failure risk assessment in PVs is presented and discussed in the context of failure risk management by intermittent inspection or by a SHM system. By sensitivity analysis, as concerns the variability of size of cracks that might subsist in the structure the benefit of applying NDI expressed in terms of reducing the probability of failure by fracture is evaluated...|$|R

Special software (SlovarRed 2. 0), based on a carefully designed database linked to the geographical information system (GIS), was developed. It not only allows accurate input of dialectological data and their analysis at different language levels but also the application of different cartographical methods (i. e., displaying linguistic data on a map). Considering the diversity (including in terms of data quality and relevancy) of the material collected in the last 60 years, the {{article presents}} those data from the database which can be displayed on a map and how. Slovenian dialects include more than sixty different lexemes (excluding phonetic variants) referring to the term 2 ̆ 7 kolk 2 ̆ 7 (Eng. : hipSLA V 055). Most of these lexemes are single-word lexemes - derivatives with 2 ̆ 7 kolk 2 ̆ 7 as the derivational base, Old Slavic *klk, and different suffixes (e. g., kolk, kolček, also kučet, kučah, kuča [...] ., kolp [...] .). Less accurate and semantically broader terms (e. g., kost, sklep, gug, skok, kraj, stran), and words that in standard language refer to {{parts of the body}} close to the hip (e. g., ledje, bok, gulj, križ, bedro, lakotnica and hrbet) are also used, both in singular and plural/dual forms (therefore also kolki, kučta, boki, glidi, hiftne). In addition to originally Slovene lexemes, loanwords (e. g., kolp, glid, hiften, hufa, anka, femore, flank/fjank) are also frequent, in particular in dialects that are in contact with neighboring languages. Moreover, word combinations consisting of these nouns and different attributes (e. g., ritna kost, ledna kost, bočna kost, ledni členek), and prepositional expressions (e. g., v kolku, <b>v</b> sklepu, ta <b>pod</b> krajem, pri strani, v ledju, na lakotnici, v hlamu, v juge) are frequent.

40|$|In the {{application}} of a non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method there are several factors that will influence whether or not the inspection will result in the correct decision as to {{the presence or absence of}} a flaw. In general, NDE involves {{the application}} of a stimulus to a structure and the subsequent interpretation of the response to the stimulus. Repeated inspections of a specific flaw can produce different magnitudes of the stimulus response because of very small variations in setup and calibration. This variability is inherent in the process. Different flaws of the same size can produce different response magnitudes because of differences in the material properties, flaw geometry and flaw orientation. Further, the interpretation of the response can be influenced by the capability of the interpreter (manual or automatic) and by the mental acuity of the inspector (in turn, dependent on many factors such as fatigue, emotional outlook, ease of access, environment, etc.). Much of the modern literature on inspection reliability constantly refers to a small set of seminal papers, derived from studies mainly carried out in the aeronautical industry. Most of the issues involved are of course very similar. One notable exception is possibly the fact that in the nuclear industry, for the very nature of the components being inspected, the sample sizes of inspected cracks tend to be much lower. In Europe, the ENIQ methodology for inspection qualification was specifically developed in the early 1990 s because of the difficulty and cost of procuring or manufacturing representative flaws in test pieces in a high enough number to draw quantitative (statistical) conclusions on the capability of the NDE system being investigated. Rather, the fundament of the ENIQ methodology is the Technical Justification, a document assembling evidence and reasoning providing assurance that the NDE system is capable of finding the flaws which it is designed to detect with a high enough reliability. This assurance is qualitative, and comes usually in the form of statements such as: "Sufficient experimental verification of the procedure has been performed, on representative defects in test blocks with the correct geometry, to be confident that the procedure and equipment will find all defects which conform to the detection criteria and to specifications within the range of plausible defects". The purpose of this document, aimed mostly at NDE engineers and practitioners, is threefold: (1) to provide a brief literature review of some important papers and reports; (2) to review in a simple and structured way the statistical models that have been proposed to quantify inspection reliability and to point out problems and pitfalls which may occur, and (3) to describe and recommend statistical best practices for producing <b>POD</b> <b>vs</b> size curves from either hit/miss data, or â vs. a data.

Pri sprejemanju akta sodelujeta sindikat in svet delavcev oziroma delavski zaupnik s podajo mnenja, na katero pa delodajalec ni vezan. Da bi začel akt veljati, je pomembno, da je pravilno objavljen in da se delavci z njim seznanijo. Akt o sistemizaciji je podlaga za mnoge procese v podjetju – bodisi zaposlovanje ali odpuščanje delavcev bodisi usposabljanje, izobraževanje, ob tem pa je osnova za številne druge avtonomne akte pri delodajalcu. Sprejem novega akta o sistemizaciji oziroma sprememba prejšnjega ne vpliva neposredno na individualna razmerja pri delodajalcu. V primeru, da sprememba sistemizacije vpliva na bistvene elemente, opredeljene v pogodbi o zaposlitvi, delodajalec in delavec sporazumno spremenita pogodbo o zaposlitvi. Kadar potreba po delu delavca pod pogoji iz pogodbe o zaposlitvi preneha, ampak delodajalec želi, da delavec nadaljuje z delom <b>v</b> podjetju, vendar <b>pod</b> spremenjenimi pogoji, ima na voljo uporabo instituta odpovedi s ponudbo nove pogodbe kot tudi sporazumne spremembe pogodbe o zaposlitvi. V praksi prihaja v okviru reorganizacije pogosto do zlorabe instituta odpovedi s ponudbo nove pogodbe, kadar pri delodajalcu dejansko ne pride do prenehanja potrebe po opravljanju dela delavca, zaradi česar je odpoved pogodbe podana nezakonito. V okviru spremembe sistemizacije lahko delodajalec seveda tudi ugotovi, da delo delavca pri njem več ni potrebno in mu iz poslovnega razloga odpove pogodbo o zaposlitvi, brez da bi mu ponudil sklenitev nove. The act on systematization {{of working}} {{positions}} is an employer’s general act, {{by which the}} latter autonomously determines working positions, working tasks and conditions for performing the work in individual working positions. In adopting the act, the trade union, and the works council or the worker representative are involved by giving an opinion, which, however, is not mandatory for the employer. In order for the act to become valid, the appropriate announcement and briefing of the employees is important. The act on systematization {{is the basis for}} many processes within the company, whether employment or redundancy, training, and education is concerned. It is the basis for many other autonomous acts of the employer. The adoption of the new act on systematization or changing the previous one does not influence the individual relations at the employer directly. In case that the alteration of systematization influences the essential elements defined in the contract of employment, the employer and the employee alter the contract of employment consensually. Whenever the need of the work of the employee ceases under the conditions of the contract, and the employer wishes for the employee to continue working in the company, but under altered conditions, the employer can use the institute of termination of the contract of employment with the offer of a new one, and also the consensual alteration of the contract of employment. In practice, the abuse of the institute of the termination of the contract of employment with the offer of a new one often occurs {{within the framework of the}} reorganization, when, on the side of the employer, there is actually no cessation of the need for performing the work of the employee – as a consequence the cancellation of the contract is given unlawfully.

40|$|In the 18 th and 19 th century several German and Baltic-German {{scientists}} investigated almost unknown {{territories of}} the Russian Empire. Many {{of them were}} invited by the Russian Imperators and some became academicians of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences,and later had considerable influence {{on the development of}} science in Russia in general and on the organization of expeditions to the Far East and Siberia in particular. German naturalists like Georg Wilhelm Steller (1709 - 1746), Johann Georg Gmelin (1709 - 1755), Peter Simon Pallas (1741 - 1811), Karl Ernst von Baer (1792 - 1876), Ferdinand von Wrangell (1797 - 1870) and Alexander Theodor von Middendorff (1815 - 1894) traveled through Siberia collecting information about flora, fauna, geology, climate, ethnology,history and economy of the Far East of Russia. Their results were published in Russian, German and French,mostly in journals of the Russian Geographical Society (St. Petersburg), in travelogues or in separate monographs and book-chapters. Results of investigations of the Russian Empire became available in Europe by special scientific journals edited e. g. by P. S. Pallas, J. G. Georgi, Th. Fr. Ehrmann, A. Erman, K. E. v. Baer and G. v. Helmersen. The western world was first informed about frozen ground in Siberia by J. G. Gmelin, who reported finding the phenomenon in Yakutsk, but Leopold von Buch (1774 - 1853) doubted his report and argued that plants were growing in this region, which considered impossible on permanently frozen ground. As a result, he demanded that Gmelin’s data be removed from scientific textbooks [1]. On behalf of a merchant of the Russian-American Company, Fedor Shergin, a shaft was dug in Yakutsk to get drinking water. To Shergi’s surprise he was unable to reach liquid water, but the governor of the Russian- American Company, Ferdinand von Wrangell, requested him to continue digging {{at the expense of the}} Company, for studies of the frozen ground underneath Yakutsk. The sinking of the well, starting in 1828, has been continued until 1837 reaching an end depth of 382 English feet (about 116. 5 m), without reaching unfrozen soil [2]. The shaft developed great importance for further geocryological studies. First measurements of soil temperature were carried out therein in April 1829 by the German physicist Adolph Erman (1806 - 1877). Down to the bottom depth of 46 Paris feet (about 15 m) at that time he recorded continuously - 6 °R (- 7. 5 °C) in all deeper parts of the well, which corresponded very well with the mean annual temperature of Yakutsk of – 5. 9 °R. This result can be credited as a first finding of the permafrost depth of “Zero Annual Amplitude”. Assuming a geothermal gradient of 1 °R/ 100 feet, Erman expected liquid water in a depth of 600 feet (about 190 m) [3] but Shergin’s measurements published in 1838 indicated temperatures of - 0. 5 °R at the end bottom of the shaft (116. 5 m) [2]. Several scientists were doubtful about Shergin’s data [3]. Between 1838 and 1843 Karl Ernst von Baer compiled all data available on frozen ground in Siberia, from sources either published or from Russian archives. He wrote a special permafrost study including the first classification of permafrost and made suggestions for regular observations in Shergin’s shaft. Baer and the commission responsible formulated instructions for an expedition to eastern Siberia initiated by Baer and led by Alexander Theodor von Middendorff with the focus to investigate the region north of Turukhansk to the Chatanga River and to investigate permafrost, especially its thickness, temperature and distribution [4]. Baer also drew the first map of permafrost distribution. Unfortunately his permafrost study and this permafrost map were not published before 2000 [5]. Baer also suggested that investigations of air and soil temperatures be carried out in British North America [6]. According to Baer’s guide in 1843 - 1845, Middendorff carried out soil temperature measurements at Turukhansk and other Siberian places. In the Shergin shaft in Yakutsk, regular measurements, started by him in 1844, had been continued until 1846 by local observers. Middendorff reported a bottom temperature in the shaft of - 2. 4 °R. He published his geothermal investigations in great detail, including data on the thermal conductivity of soils, which were a result of the geothermic measurements in Shergin’s shaft [7]. As Erman had also earlier assumed, he supposed a permafrost depth of 600 feet beneath Yakutsk. Baer began a long discussion with him about his conclusions and the geothermal gradient he reported [8](cf. also [9]). Middendorff’s collection of permafrost observations in Siberia and his conclusions for the geographical distribution and thickness of permafrost provided the foundation for a generation of geocryologists. Temperature measurements in the active layer were carried out within the framework of the International Polar Year 1882 - 1883 at Sagastyr Station in the Lena River delta and on Novaya Zemlya. Soil temperature observations had been included in the meteorological program and were carried out regularly at 0. 4 m, 0. 8 m and 1. 6 m depths [10]. The medical doctor Alexander von Bunge (1851 - 1930) was a participant of this expedition. He described the place on Bykovsky Peninsula where Adams found the first mammoth carcass in 1799 and reported on other mammoth carcasses found in the Lena Delta, and on permafrost soils, polygonal structures and ice wedges that he observed. He published a hypothesis on the genesis of ground ice by thermal contraction [11]. In 1885 - 1886 Bunge was the leader of the expedition of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences to the New Siberian Islands during which he and his companion Eduard von Toll (1858 - 1902) found mammoth relicts and studied the ground ice formations on Great Lyakhovsky Island. European scientists were deeply impressed by the first photographs of huge ground ice wedges published by Toll. He speculated that these formations were relicts of glaciers and introduced terms like “fossil ice“and “ice rock”(Steineis) into geocryology [12].
