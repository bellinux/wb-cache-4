A partnership between the IWM, the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, and Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh museum authorities, phase one included a touring exhibition seen by more than two million people, overseas educational <b>visits</b> <b>and</b> further activities run by local authorities. A second phase took a wider 20th century historical remit; it comprised a learning programme using overseas <b>visits</b> <b>and</b> social media, and a professional development scheme for educators. A digital archive of the project, online exhibitions and learning resources were also produced.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAimThe {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of scaling and root planing (SRP) and adjunctive chemotherapy (doxycycline hyclate, 20 mg) on gingival health, specific cytokines and glycemic control in diabetic subjects. MethodsThree hundred and forty-six type 1 and 2 diabetic subjects were randomized into four test groups: (1) one session of SRP at the baseline <b>visit</b> <b>and</b> placebo tablets twice/day, started at the baseline visit, for 3 months, (2) one session of SRP at the baseline <b>visit,</b> <b>and</b> doxycycline hyclate (20 mg, twice/day) started at the baseline visit for 3 months, (3) two sessions of SRP, first at the baseline <b>visit</b> <b>and</b> second at the 6 months, with placebo tablets twice/day started at the baseline <b>visit</b> <b>and</b> 6 -month <b>visit,</b> for 3 months at each <b>visit,</b> <b>and</b> (4) two sessions of SRP, first at the baseline <b>visit</b> <b>and</b> the second at the 6 -month <b>visit,</b> <b>and</b> doxycycline hyclate 20 mg twice/day, started at the baseline <b>visit</b> <b>and</b> the 6 -month visit, for 3 months at each visit. Venous blood samples were obtained to evaluate TNF-α, IL- 1 α and glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c); dental measurements were also included. ResultsHbA 1 c showed significant improvement (P< 0. 05) only for subjects with glycated hemoglobin ⩽ 8. 8 % within each group, as well as when subjects were combined together. All groups achieved statistically significant improvements for most of the dental parameters at follow-up visits (P< 0. 05) compared to the baseline. ConclusionsEliminating periodontal inflammation may significantly reduce glycated hemoglobin levels for subjects with HbA 1 c ⩽ 8. 8 %; furthermore, SRP and adjunctive therapy improved periodontal inflammation in diabetics...|$|R

5|$|Before the {{formation}} of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, called the Armée d'Angleterre (Army of England) around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England, and was so confident of success that he had commemorative medals struck to celebrate the conquest of the English. Although they never invaded, Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation. Boredom among the troops occasionally set in, but Napoleon paid many <b>visits</b> <b>and</b> conducted lavish parades in order to boost morale.|$|E

5|$|Current Electoral College rules {{effectively}} force {{candidates to}} focus disproportionately {{on a small}} percentage of pivotal swing states, while sidelining the rest. A study by FairVote reported that the 2004 candidates devoted three quarters of their peak season campaign resources to just five states, while the other 45 states received very little attention. The report also stated that 18 states received no candidate <b>visits</b> <b>and</b> no TV advertising. This means that swing state issues receive more attention, while issues important to other states are largely ignored.|$|E

They were also somewhat concerned about Hogg's association with the radical publisher Leigh Hunt and his circle of friends. Through Hunt, Hogg became acquainted with several members of London's literary circles, including Thomas Love Peacock, Charles Lamb and Walter Coulson.
