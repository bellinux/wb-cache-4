5|$|In April 1965, the United States Naval Research Laboratory group {{launched}} an Aerobee 150 rocket {{equipped with a}} pair of Geiger counters. This flight discovered seven candidate X-ray sources, including the first extragalactic X-ray source; <b>Virgo</b> X-1 was designated as the first X-ray source detected in <b>Virgo.</b> A later Aerobee rocket launched from White Sands Missile Range on July 7, 1967, yielded further evidence that the source of <b>Virgo</b> X-1 was the radio galaxy M87. Subsequent X-ray observations by the HEAO 1 and Einstein Observatory showed a complex source that included the active galactic nucleus of M87. However, there is little central concentration of the X-ray emission.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way {{galaxy is}} a member of an {{association}} named the Local Group, a relatively small group of galaxies that has a diameter of approximately onemegaparsec. The Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are the two brightest galaxies within the group; many of the other member galaxies are dwarf companions of these two galaxies. The Local Group itself is a part of a cloud-like structure within the <b>Virgo</b> Supercluster, a large, extended structure of groups and clusters of galaxies centered on the <b>Virgo</b> Cluster. And the <b>Virgo</b> Supercluster itself {{is a part of the}} Pisces-Cetus Supercluster Complex, a giant galaxy filament.|$|E
5|$|Messier 87 (also {{known as}} <b>Virgo</b> A or NGC 4486, and {{generally}} abbreviated to M87) is a supergiant elliptical galaxy {{in the constellation}} <b>Virgo.</b> One of the most massive galaxies in the local universe, it is notable for its large population of globular clusters—M87 contains about 12,000 compared to the 150–200 orbiting the Milky Way—and its jet of energetic plasma that originates at the core and extends outward at least 1,500 parsecs (4,900 light-years), travelling at relativistic speed. It {{is one of the}} brightest radio sources in the sky, and is a popular target for both amateur astronomy observations and professional astronomy study.|$|E

5000|$|Meikher rejoined Nu <b>Virgos,</b> now {{consisting}} of Vinnitskaya, Meikher, Anna Sedokova and Tatiana Naynik, in September 2002. Vinnitskaya and Naynik left the group shortly after, and {{were replaced by}} Vera Brezhneva. The period between January 2003 and September 2004, during which Nu <b>Virgos</b> consisted of Meikher, Sedokova and Brezhneva, has been considered [...] "golden era" [...] of the group. In January 2006, Meikher left Nu <b>Virgos</b> once again in order to focus on her solo projects.

5|$|The ASAT test mission, {{the final}} {{flight of the}} High <b>Virgo</b> missile, was {{conducted}} on September 22, 1959. Less than a minute after {{the launch of the}} missile from its B-58 carrier aircraft at Mach 2, the telemetry signal was lost. No data was recovered from the test, and the camera data, intended to be recovered afterward, was not located. Hence the test was inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|The High <b>Virgo,</b> {{also known}} as Weapons System 199C (WS-199C), was a {{prototype}} air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) jointly developed by Lockheed and the Convair division of General Dynamics during the late 1950s. The missile proved moderately successful and aided {{in the development of}} the later GAM-87 Skybolt ALBM. It was also used in early tests of anti-satellite weapons.|$|E

5|$|According to {{an early}} {{estimate}} by The Globe and Mail, 25,000 uniformed police officers, 1,000 security guards from Commissionaires Great Lakes, and several Canadian military forces were to be deployed during the summit. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) conducted Amalgam <b>Virgo</b> exercises on May 6 and 7 across the Greater Toronto Area using CF-18 Hornet jets, CH-124 Sea Kings, and CH-146 Griffon helicopters at low altitudes.

5|$|Approximately 200 {{million light-years}} from Earth with a {{redshift}} of 0.016 is Abell 3627; {{also called the}} Norma Cluster, {{it is one of}} the most massive galaxy clusters known to exist, at ten times the average cluster mass. Abell 3627 is thus theorized to be the Great Attractor, a massive object that is pulling the Local Group, the <b>Virgo</b> Supercluster, and the Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster towards its location at 600–1000 kilometres per second.|$|E

5|$|Observations of binary pulsars provide strong {{indirect}} {{evidence for the}} existence of gravitational waves (see Orbital decay, above). Detection of these waves is a major goal of current relativity-related research. Several land-based gravitational wave detectors are currently in operation, most notably the interferometric detectors GEO 600, LIGO (two detectors), TAMA 300 and <b>VIRGO.</b> Various pulsar timing arrays are using millisecond pulsars to detect gravitational waves in the 10−9 to 10−6 Hertz frequency range, which originate from binary supermassive blackholes. A European space-based detector, eLISA / NGO, is currently under development, with a precursor mission (LISA Pathfinder) having launched in December 2015.|$|E

Covering 636.9 square degrees total, it ranks 23rd of the 88 constellations in size. It appears {{prominently}} in both the northern and southern skies during the Northern Hemisphere's summer. Its main asterism consists of 11 stars, and 108 stars in total are brighter than magnitude 6.5, the traditional limit for naked-eye visibility.|$|E
5|$|Since Callimachus' poem, Coma Berenices {{has been}} {{occasionally}} mentioned outside astronomy. In 1886, Spanish artist Luis Ricardo Falero created a mezzotint print personifying Coma Berenices alongside <b>Virgo</b> and Leo. In 1892, the Russian poet Afanasy Fet made the constellation {{the subject of}} his short poem, composed for the Countess Natalya Sollogub. Francisco Guerrero, a 20th century composer from Spain, wrote an orchestral work on the constellation in 1996. In 1999 Irish artist Alice Maher made a series of four oversize drawings, entitled Coma Berenices, of entwining black hair coils.|$|E

5000|$|Despite initial {{claims that}} Nu <b>Virgos</b> {{would no longer}} exist as a group, at the {{beginning}} of 2013 Konstantin Meladze announced a casting for his new show, [...] "Хочу V ВИА Гру" [...] ("I want to be in VIA Gra"). The casting was formatted as a reality TV show, consisting of eight episodes, by the end of which three new soloists were chosen by popular vote: Erika Gerceg, Anastasia Kozhevnikova and Misha Romanova. In November 2013, they released their new single and music video, entitled, [...] "Перемирие" [...] ("Truce"). Meanwhile, during Meladze's casting show, Dmitriy Kostyuk, ex-general producer of Nu <b>Virgos,</b> announced his own new lineup. In fall 2013, he presented his VIA Gra: Darya Rostova, Darya Medovaya and Aina Vilberg. At a show in Kiev, they performed singles from their new album [...] "Магия" [...] ("Magic"). This caused further tensions between Meladze and Kostuyk, who were already at odds since the dissolution of the old Nu <b>Virgos.</b> In May 2014, the new Nu <b>Virgos</b> released their second single since, [...] "У меня появился другой (I've Got Another Man)", featuring Georgian rapper Vakhtang. In 2014, the group was criticized in Ukraine for having accepted awards in Russia while many Ukrainians believed their country was a victim of Russian aggression. In November 2014, Nu <b>Virgos</b> were featured on a new single released by Russian rapper Mot, titled [...] "Кислород" [...] ("Oxygen").|$|R
