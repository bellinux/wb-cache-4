40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an easy-to-implement passive liquid valve (PLV) for the {{microfluidic}} compact-disc (CD). This valve {{can be implemented}} by introducing <b>venting</b> <b>chambers</b> to control the air flow of the source and destination chambers. The PLV mechanism is based on equalizing the main forces acting on the microfluidic CD (i. e., the centrifugal and capillary forces) to control the burst frequency of the source chamber liquid. For {{a better understanding of}} the physics behind the proposed PLV, an analytical model is described. Moreover, three parameters that control the effectiveness of the proposed valve, i. e., the liquid height, liquid density, and <b>venting</b> <b>chamber</b> position with respect to the CD center, are tested experimentally. To demonstrate the ability of the proposed PLV valve, microfluidic liquid switching and liquid metering are performed. In addition, a Bradford assay is performed to measure the protein concentration and evaluated in comparison to the benchtop procedure.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{investigation has}} been conducted to study the effect and mechanisms of the passive control of a supersonic flow over a rectangular two-dimensional cavity. The passive control was included {{through the use of}} a porous surface over a <b>vent</b> <b>chamber</b> in the floor of the cavity. The passive control effectively suppressed the low-frequency pressure oscillations for the open type cavity, (length-to-depth ratio = 6. 0). The mechanism for the suppression was observed to be the stabilization of the motion of the free shear layer. For the closed type cavity flow, (length-to-depth ratio = 17. 5), the passive control modified the flowfield to nearly that of an open type cavity flow; further the cavity drag was reduced by a factor of four. The computational results of both cases showed good agreement with the available experimental data and the predictions of a semiempirical formula.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to determine {{the effectiveness of a}} passive-venting system to modify the flow field characteristics of a rectangular-box cavity at supersonic speeds. The passive-venting system consists of a porous floor with a <b>vent</b> <b>chamber</b> beneath the floor. For certain cavity length-to-height ratios, this configuration allowed high-pressure air {{at the rear of the}} cavity to vent to the forward part of the cavity, thereby modifying the cavity flow field. The wind-tunnel model consisted of a flat plate that housed a cavity mounted on a balance such that only the cavity drag was measured. The cavity height remained constant, and the length varied with rectangular-block inserts. Both solid-and porous-floor cavities were tested for comparison at Mach numbers of 1. 60, 1. 90, 2. 16, and 2. 86. These results showed that the passive-venting system did modify the cavity flow field. In order to determine the type flow field which existed for the porous-floor configuration, pressures were measured inside the cavity at the same conditions and for the same configurations as those used in the drag tests. Pressure data were also obtained with stores mounted in the cavity. These results, along with Schlieren photographs and the tabulated data, are presented to document the porous-floor cavity flow field...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} experiments towards {{establishing a}} predictive capability for nondetonative reactions in confined explosive systems. Composition-B was confined in steel tubes of various thicknesses and pressurized in separate experiments by self combustion and at various rates with a piston. Reactions were observed with high-speed film and embedded pressure gages. Many of the reactions possessed characteristic secondary ignitions {{away from the}} expected combustion surface or loading surface. These ignitions frequently start when the pressure is less than 1 kBar, and they {{play a major role}} in the reaction character. After secondary ignition, reaction violence was primarily driven by the strength of the confinement in a tradeoff between pressurization due to combustion and venting after confinement has failed. The former is directly determined by the burning rate of the Comp-B and the surface area available for burning. Strand burner, closed bomb, and <b>vented</b> <b>chamber</b> experiments were conducted to examine the burning behavior and regression rate. The process seems to be reproducible up to pressures of ~ 100 MPa. At greater pressures, the pressurization rates indicate that Comp-B may be rapidly deconsolidating.

Scanning electron microscopy of the quenched surfaces showed pits consistent with a mechanism whereby RDX particles are dislodged from the surface during the burning process.

40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{models were}} created and {{analyzed}} using the commercially available hydrocode SHARC {{to determine if}} SHARC can accurately predict the behavior of explosions in enclosed <b>vented</b> <b>chambers.</b> Axisymmetric two-dimensional models were generated using the same physical parameters used in similar model tests performed by the US Army. Three different chamber/vent configurations were investigated with three charge sizes per configuration in order to compare the SHARC results to the data obtained from the model tests. The time of arrival of shocks and the peak over-pressure were compared. The calculations were then analyzed using several graphical tools currently available. It was found that SHARC is able to produce valid results, but with some limitations. One such limitation stems from the nature of computational fluid dynamics calculations in that some information is lost due to the discrete time steps used for calculating the various flow field parameters. Another limitation was introduced by the utility program necessary for restarting the code due to the interpolating process it uses to generate data for input to future executions of SHARC.

Enhanced-effi ciency N fertilizers evaluated were a controlled-release, polymer-coated urea (ESN), stabilized urea, and UAN products containing nitrifi cation and urease inhibitors (SuperU and UAN+AgrotainPlus), and UAN containing a slow-release N source (Nfusion).
