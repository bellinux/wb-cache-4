40|$|The {{canonical}} {{correlations between}} subsets of OLS estimators are identified with design linkage parameters between their regressors. Known collinearity indices are extended to encompass angles between each regressor vector and remaining vectors. One such angle quantifies the collinearity of regressors with the intercept, {{of concern in}} the corruption of all estimates due to ill-conditioning. Matrix identities factorize a determinant in terms of principal subdeterminants and the canonical <b>Vector</b> <b>Alienation</b> <b>Coefficients</b> between subset estimators—by duality, the <b>Alienation</b> <b>Coefficients</b> between subsets of regressors. These identities figure {{in the study of}} D and as determinant efficiencies for estimators and their subsets, specifically, -efficiencies for the constant, linear, pure quadratic, and interactive coefficients in eight known small second-order designs. Studies on D- and -efficiencies confirm that designs are seldom efficient for both. Determinant identities demonstrate the propensity for -inefficient subsets to be masked through near collinearities in overall D-efficient designs...|$|R

40|$|The {{correspondence}} {{between theory and}} observation is often evaluated by a comparison between a hypothesized constraint matrix and the spatial representation of a pxp similarity matrix. This comparison of constraint and proximity matrices assumes the accurate translation of similarities to proximities. If the translation is not exact (i. e., a stress or <b>alienation</b> <b>coefficient</b> greater than zero), the hypothesized structure is evaluated using a false representation of the observed data. The proposed model {{eliminates the need for}} spatial representation by making a direct comparison between the hypothesized constraint matrix and the multivariate structure of the bivariate similarities.

40|$|Abstract — In modern digital {{protection}} and control systems, an alienation technique has recently become the workhorse of quantitative research and analysis. In this paper, an alienation technique is developed for calculations of original power factor on-line, active and compensation reactive powers and determination of the required number of capacitor banks to get the desired power factor. <b>Alienation</b> <b>coefficients</b> are calculated between phase voltage and current signals of power supply. These calculations are performed within one-cycle. Thus, the algorithm is well suited for implementation in a digital reactive power control scheme. This scheme is able accurately to identify the required capacitor rating to get the desired power factor under different loading levels. It does not need any extra equipment as it depends only on the voltage and line-current measurements which are mostly available at the relay location. Alternative transient program (ATP) and MATLAB programs are used to implement the proposed technique. Index Terms — Power system, power factor correction...|$|R

An alienation technique is developed for busbar protection against all ten types of shunt faults, which may locate in busbar protection zone, under different loading levels, fault resistances and fault inception angle. It {{does not need}} any extra equipment as it depends only on the three-line currents measurements, of all feeders connected to the protected busbar, which are mostly available at the relay location. It is able to perform fault detection, fault confirmation, faulty phase selection and determine the fault location in about a half-cycle period. Thus, the alienation technique is well suited for implementation in digital protection schemes. The technique is efficient to detect current transformer saturation conditions without needing any additional algorithm. The effects of DC components and harmonics are eliminated with estimation of <b>alienation</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The proposed scheme is applied for an experimental circuit.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to compare the {{temperature}} influence on activity level of the digestive enzymes of the intestinal mucous tunic of Russian sturgeon, Siberian sturgeon and their hybrid ROLO. There have been studied four enzymes – α-amylase, maltase, alkaline phosphatase and to-tal proteinases researched in the temperature range from 0 to 60 °С. The main method of the data processing was multidimensional scaling. In {{the capacity of the}} method of estimation of the dis-tances between multidimensional variables which contain information about activity level under the temperature influence the city-block distance was used. After the data processing by nonmetric multidimensional scaling of the experimental data studied variables were plotted on the two-dimensional map. Values of the stress-function and <b>alienation</b> <b>coefficient</b> were 0. 045 and 0. 059 accordingly which is indicative of correctly computed conversion of the initial distances. There has been demonstrated that reactions of the digestive enzymes of the hybrid under the influence of different temperature are the most similar with the enzymes of Russian sturgeon. In all cases data containing information about influence of moderate and low temperature on enzymes and analogical data about high temperature are in different clusters which signify about essential changes of adaptive reactions of the enzymes. Data of influence of temperature 60 °С are moved away from the main data array. The conclusion about prospects of application of multidimensional scaling for the complex data analysis in the ecological physiology when multidimensional experimental data array processing is made...|$|R
40|$|The {{coefficient}} of correlation evaluates the similarity of two sets of measurements (i. e., two dependent variables) obtained on the same observations. The {{coefficient of}} correlation indicates {{the amount of information}} common to two variables. This coefficient takes values between− 1 and+ 1 (inclusive). A value of 0 indicates that the two series of measurement have nothing in common. A value of + 1 says that the two series of measurements are measuring the same thing. A value of − 1 says that the two measurements are measuring the same thing but one measurement varies inversely to the other. The squared correlation gives the proportion of common variance between two variables and is also called the coefficient of determination. Subtracting the coefficient of determination from the unity gives the proportion of variance not shared between two variables, a quantity also called the <b>coefficient</b> of <b>alienation.</b> The <b>coefficient</b> of correlation measures only the linear relationship between two variables, and its value is very sensitive t...|$|R

The high emotional maturity and social adjustment will help to reduce the alienation level among the schoolgirls of boarding school who are considered face the various social conditions that potentially cause alienation. The purpose {{of this research is}} to find out: 1) the relationship of emotional maturity and social adjustment with alienation; 2) the relationship of emotional maturity to alienation; 3) the relationship of social adjustment to alienation among the schoolgirls of SMP IT Ihsanul Fikri Boarding School Magelang. The population of this research was schoolgirls of SMP Islam Terpadu Ihsanul Fikri Boarding School Magelang class VII and VIII which amounts to 5 classes. The sample consisted of 2 classes of class VII and a class of class VIII. The sampling technique used cluster sampling. Measuring instruments were compiled by researcher, they were Alienation Scale that consisted of 28 items with reliability coefficient of 0. 872; Emotional Maturity Scale that consisted of 29 items with reliability coefficient of 0. 863, and Social Adjustment Scale that consistied of 30 items with reliability coefficient of 0. 912. The result of multiple linear regression analysis showed that the correlation coefficient (R) was 0, 788, p= 0. 000 (p Ftab= 3, 95.
