40|$|Successful {{operation}} of the APS storage ring (SR) in top-off mode requires a reliable injector system that efficiently delivers up to 10 nC of charge at 7 GeV to the SR. One way to possibly improve injector reliability is to inject the linac beam directly into the booster and bypass the PAR. Direct injection into the booster imposes several requirements on the booster rf system. First, the rf must capture the complete linac beam {{or at least a}} large fraction of it. Second, bunch purity must be preserved. Third, the whole acceleration process from injection to extraction at 7 GeV must be as efficient (as measured by particle loss) as possible at up to 10 nC of extracted charge. Finally, the rf system parameters should be chosen to preserve the present linear ramp profile used in the booster (0. 325 to 7 GeV in 223 ms). The last requirement minimizes the required recommissiong effort since the magnet ramps are left unchanged. These requirements can be achieved by adding a subharmonic rf system at the appropriate frequency and gap <b>voltage</b> in the <b>booster.</b> The subharmonic system in combination with the present booster 352 -MHz rf system act together to accelerate the beam to 7 GeV while minimizing beam loss and preserving bunch purity.

40|$|An energy {{harvester}} is {{a system}} consisting of several components from different physical domains including mechanical, magnetic and electrical {{as well as the}} external circuits which regulate and store the generated energy. To design highly efficient energy harvesters, we believe that the various components of the energy harvesters need to be modelled together and in systematic manner using one simulation platform. We propose an accurate HDL model for the energy harvester and demonstrate its accuracy by validating it experimentally and comparing it with recently reported models. It is crucial to consider the various parts of the energy harvester {{in the context of a}} complete system, or else the gain at one part may come at the price of efficiency loss else where, rending the energy harvester much less efficient than before. The close mechanical-electrical interaction that takes place in energy harvesters, often lead to significant performance loss when the various parts of the energy harvesters are combined. Therefore, to address the performance loss, we propose an integrated approach to the energy harvester modelling and performance optimisation and demonstrate the effectiveness of employing such an approach by showing that it is possible to improve the performance of vibrationbased energy harvester, in terms of the effective energy stored in the super-capacitor, by 33 % through optimising the micro-generator mechanical parameters and the <b>voltage</b> <b>booster</b> circuit components...|$|E
40|$|While {{integrated}} circuit (IC) power management {{has been an}} eternal topic for chip designers, inductor based DC-DC converters have been dominant {{in the field for}} years. However, because of the natures of inductors: large electro-magnetic interference, high coupling noise, and difficult silicon fabrication process, they are not favorable to on-chip solutions. Switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converters, which adopt capacitors for their energy storage components, have become increasingly popular among both the academia and the industry, because, apparently, they avoid the drawbacks of the inductor counterparts, and can be directly implemented on-chip without additional fabrication process. In this paper, we will investigate {{one of the most famous}} SC voltage doubler topologies, which is known as 2 ̆ 2 Favrat Cell 2 ̆ 2. By designing a chip, which converts 1. 5 V voltage input to 2. 5 V voltage output at 1 mA current load, we will walk through the details of a SC DC-DC converter design, including the switch cell, timing system, regulation loop and efficiency analysis. The design uses two 200 pF pumping capacitors and a 400 pF output capacitor in On-Semi half-micron technology. Four-way interleaved phase structure is adopted to reduce the output voltage ripple. The gate-drive strategy of the switches has been improved to further reduce the reverse current injections during transitions.

40|$|The recent advancements in neuroprosthetics {{have pushed}} forward the {{development}} of new implantable electronic interfaces between the Peripheral Neural System (PNS) and a robotic limb [1]. One of the main advantages of the neuroprostheses is the possibility to restore the sensory feedback to the patient. This is possible thanks tocustom designed devices able to transduce the external information, picked up by sensors collocated on the robotic limb, into electrical currents to be injected through the nerve [2]. In this paper, a neural stimulator able to deliver bi-phasic current pulses to eight different channels is presented. An Integrated Circuit (IC), implemented in a HV 0. 35 µm technology from AMS has been realized and successfully tested. The impedance at the electrode-tissue interface is highly variable and degrades with time, therefore a high voltage supply is needed to guarantee the selected stimulation current even in case of high impedance contact [3]. For this reason, a <b>voltage</b> <b>booster</b> has been introduced in the design to provide a highvoltage supply to the stimulator output stage. Fig. 1 represents the block diagram of our system: the stimulation currents are generated by 6 -bit current DACs implemented in a low voltage domain tosave power and area. The current is then mirrored into a high voltage output stage, powered by the voltage generated by the booster. Finally, the current is injected into the patient nerve by means of intrafascicular electrodes [4]. The current must be generated avoiding charge accumulation at the tissue interface, in fact, this can cause severe damages to the cells. Bi-phasic waveforms prevent this risk balancing the current injected in the first phase with a second opposite phase. A third phase, in which the electrode terminals are shorted together, has been added to eliminate any residual charge. The circuit used to realize this pattern and the pulse diagram are shown, respectively, in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. The current can be programmed via-PC by the user in terms of amplitude, pulse width and period as indicated in Table 1. The experimental setup used to test the stimulator (Fig. 4) is made up of a custom PCB, that hosts the IC, and a Xilinx FPGA Spartan- 6 LX 45, used to configure the IC and to manage the communication with the PC. The chip occupies an area of 17. 68 mm 2 (the layout is represented in Fig. 5) and consumes 29 mW in high power mode. First, the capability of the <b>voltage</b> <b>booster</b> to generate programmable voltages has been tested. Fig. 6 shows as a supply voltage up to 15. 8 V can be generated by the booster. The current programmability is shown in Fig. 7, where, using a 10 kΩ resistance to emulate the electrode impedance, a biphasic pulse with different amplitudes has been obtained. With this impedance, currents up to 326 µAcan be reached. Fig. 8, shows a pulse train acquired choosing a pulse width of 150 µs and a frequency of 400 Hz. All the results confirm the system capability to properly deliver the programmed stimulation currents...|$|E
30|$|Initially {{we have to}} {{consider}} the power system operation without the insertion of SFCLs. Under this scenario, the output electrical power drops sharply to 0.15  pu just after the fault incident (Fig. 4 a), whilst the governors of the power plant, such as steam and hydro, still contribute with the same mechanical power to the rotors. Thus, a rapid acceleration of the rotors occurs due to this power imbalance, as shown in Fig. 4 b. However, when an SFCL is installed at Branch 1 (Location 1), its high resistance state facilitates the SFCL to dissipate the excess generator power during the fault condition, hence improving the energy balance of the system and effectively reducing the variation of the rotor speed. Furthermore, considering the conventional equal-area criterion for stability issues (Sung et al. 2009; Kundur et al. 1994), the SFCL could improve the damping characteristics of generator speed and system frequency, as well as the system current, because the insertion of high resistance into the grid would significantly increase the damping ratio. Moreover, due to the short-circuit fault of Branch 1, a sharp voltage drop (Fig. 4 c, d) can be seen at both the power plant terminal (0.5  pu) and the non-faulted Branch 2 (0.35  pu). Then, by introducing the SFCL, which acts as a <b>voltage</b> <b>booster,</b> the observed voltage dips are mitigated by 40 and 50 %, respectively. This improvement allows the healthy parts of the system (without the fault inception) to be less affected, and makes integration of an SFCL a reliable fault ride-through scheme.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} years many {{scientific}} advances have been done {{on the development of}} neural prostheses [1] for hand amputees. Recent achievements in this field have made this challenge easier with the introduction of innovative biocompatible materials and the production of smart, light, artificial limbs characterized by lots of freedom degrees [2]. Despite such improvements, the communication between an implanted electrode and a prosthetic limb is still an open issue, due to long cables and cumbersome electronic equipments that typically separate them. In this contest it is very important the miniaturization of the electronic used to acquire the neural signals from efferent fibers of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) and to elicitate the afferent axons in order to restore the sensory feedback. Due to the weak amplitude of neural signals, this kind of design is particularly critical. Indeed neural signals are drowned in a noisy environment characterized by other biological electrical sources such as Electromyographic (EMG) interferences which have amplitudes many orders of magnitude greater than that of the neural signal and a bandwidth very close to them. The system proposed in this paper is based on a sigma delta converter divided into two main blocks: an on-chip analog front-end, that includes a sigma delta modulator and a digital part, realized off- chip on a FPGA. The main aim is to move the majority of the complexity on the digital side, keeping the analog part as simple as possible. The CMOS recording chip, designed on an AMS 0. 35 um process, contains 8 parallel readout channels and has a 4. 1 mm x 4. 1 mm die size. Several parameters (amplifier gain, opamp bandwidths, etc.) are programmable. Fig. 1 shows the chip test results for an input trace obtained from real measurements of an electrode implanted in a rat sciatic nerve. The original signal is largely affected by low-frequency noise (ECG and EMG) which is completely removed by the system. Regarding the stimulation unit another CMOS analog chip has been designed. It is able to deliver biphasic current pulses whose shape and parameters are summarized in Fig. 2 (on the left). The system is based on a single supply with anodic and cathodic active phases. Fig. 2 (on the right) shows the stimulation diagram. The stimulation is enabled by closing switch S 1 whereas with switch S 2 it is possible to select between anodic or cathodic phase. Even though the positive and negative currents have the same value, a residual charge can be accumulated at the electrode-nerve interface due to mismatches in the two current paths. As a result, some electrochemical damaging processes can occur at this interface. Therefore, to avoid charge accumulation, a periodic charge cancellation phase is necessary. A switch S 3 has been introduced to periodically shortcut the two electrode terminals removing all the stored charge. Due to the high value and to the high variability of the electrode-tissue impedance, a programmable high voltage stimulator is required. The designed stimulation system (Fig. 3) is based on a low voltage 6 -bit current DAC used to setup the stimulation current level. The current is then converted from a low into a high voltage signal by the output stage and injected into the nerve. The high voltage supply for the output stage is generated by a programmable <b>voltage</b> <b>booster</b> that increases the voltage up to 20 V. The stimulation unit and in particular the <b>voltage</b> <b>booster</b> has been designed achieving a good compromise between size and boosting time. The IC has been designed on an AMS High Voltage 0. 35 um CMOS process which includes both low voltage and high voltage transistors. Fig. 4 shows the stimulating chip layout...|$|E
40|$|To {{increase}} their usability wind and kinetic-tidal generators and Electric Vehicles (EVs) require efficient conversion between mechanical and electrical energy. The brushless dc machine (BLDCM) is entirely suitable {{for such a}} task, and to exemplify its use this thesis details a high efficiency kinetic-tidal energy generator test system. To maximise the energy yield it uses a low solidity turbine, an efficient transmission system, a BLDCM generator, and a maximum power point tracker. BLDCM cogging torque is also addressed. Measured results are presented, with the measured efficiency of the water-turbine being 30 %in real-world conditions. Although the BLDCM is an efficient energy converter, it requires power electronic control; the soft-switched Actively Clamped Resonant DC Link Inverter (ACRLI) is an ideal choice for such. This thesis details a complete mathematical analysis of the ACRLI topology, and develops formulae for all important voltages, currents, and timing. A complete list of loss formulae for all major components, including a MOSFET clamp device, is presented. These formulae {{can be used to}} optimally design ACRLIs, and an optimal design for a 10 kW EV is described. Since the inductor in a high power ACRLI is problematic, this thesis addresses large ferritecored inductor design, analysing hysteresis and eddy current core loss and Litz wire conduction loss. An optimal but non-realisable design is shown, followed by a near-optimal, realisable and economical very low loss inductor design; an inductor was fabricated in accordance with this design and its measured loss in resonant link operation, being less than 20 W for the 10 kW high current inverter, is consistent with theory. The BLDCM’s applicability in the general EV field has been questioned due to its rectangular torque versus speed characteristic. To modify this characteristic a <b>voltage</b> <b>booster</b> could be used. The ACRLI can provide such boosting {{with the addition of a}} few components, the main one being a rectifier grade thyristor, thus creating the Actively Clamped Resonant DC Link-Boost Inverter (ACRL-BI) topology.

40|$|This {{research}} work investigates methodologies for VHDL-AMS based mixed technology modelling and optimisation, specifically with automotive, energy harvesting and MEMS applications in mind. The contributions are summarised as follows: Firstly, methodologies that support modelling and simulation of mixed-domain automotive {{systems have been}} developed. VHDL-AMS and its standard packages {{have been used to}} generate efficient models of complex automotive systems. Secondly, a novel, VHDL-AMS based optimisation of fuzzy logic controllers has been developed. The idea is to optimise the shapes of fuzzy logic membership functions using a genetic algorithm. Since the system to be optimised is also implemented in VHDLAMS, this methodology has resulted in an integrated performance optimisation system that is wholly implemented in a hardware description language. Thirdly, the first complete VHDL-AMS modelling approach has been presented for the DATE’ 99 benchmark to model a portal crane and embedded control. The model was proposed for a DATE’ 99 technical panel discussion to compare different languages for system level specification. The obtained new benchmark results have proved the suitability of VHDL-AMS for creating executable specifications of heterogeneous embedded systems. Fourthly, an automated energy harvester design flow which is based on a single HDL software platform {{that can be used to}} model, simulate, configure and optimise energy harvester systems has been proposed. VHDL-AMS has been used to incorporate various parts of the energy harvester (micro-generator, <b>voltage</b> <b>booster,</b> etc) into a single model. The salient feature of an integrated model is that it allows optimisation based on system performance, which is not possible in conventional modelling approaches. Fifthly, to enhance the modelling capability of VHDL-AMS for systems with MEMS structures where distributed behaviour is essential, language extensions have been proposed to efficiently implement general partial differential equations. The extended language has been named VHDL-AMSP. A suitable preprocessor has been developed to automatically convert VHDL-AMSP into the existing VHDL-AMS 1076. 1 standard, so that models with partial differential equations can be simulated using currently available simulators. Finally, case studies have been presented to validate the developed methodologies. These case studies include: a portal crane and its embedded control, an automotive vibration isolation seating system, a fuzzy logic controller for automotive active suspension systems, a vibration-based electromagnetic energy harvester, and a MEMS accelerometer in high-order sigma-delta-modulator loops.

[...] School of Computing and Engineering and the Dept. of Physics & Astronomy. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2013 This dissertation {{focuses on the}} problem of increasing the lifetime of wireless sensors. This problem is addressed from two different angles: energy harvesting and data compression. Energy harvesting enables a sensor to extract energy from its environment and use it to power itself or recharge its batteries. Data compression, on the other hand, allows a sensor to save energy by reducing the radio transmission bandwidth. This dissertation proposes a fractal-based photodiode fabricated on standard CMOS process as an energy harvesting device with increased efficiency. Experiments show that, the fractal based photodiodes are 6 % more efficient compared to the conventional square shaped photodiode. The fractal shape photodiode has more perimeter-to-area ratio which increases the lateral response, improving its efficiency. With increased efficiency, more current is generated but the open-circuit voltage still remains low (0 : 3 V - 0 : 45 V depending on illumination condition). These voltages have to be boosted up to higher values {{if they are going to}} be used to power up any sensory circuit or recharge a battery. We propose a switched-inductor DC-DC converter to boost the low voltage of the photodiodes to higher voltages. The proposed circuit uses two onchip switches and two off-chip components: an inductor and a capacitor. Experiments show a voltage up to 2 : 81 V can be generated from a single photodiode of 1 mm 2 area. The <b>voltage</b> <b>booster</b> circuit achieved a conversion efficiency of 59 %. Data compression was also explored in an effort to reduce energy consumption during radio transmission. An analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which can jointly perform the tasks of digital conversion and entropy encoding, has also been proposed in this dissertation. The joint data conversion/compression help savings in area and power resources, making it suitable for on-sensor compression. The proposed converter combines a cyclic converter architecture and Golomb-Rice entropy encoder. The converter hardware design is based on current-mode circuits and it was fabricated on a 0 : 5 m CMOS process and tested. Experiment results show a lossless compression ratio of 1 : 52 and a near-lossless compression of 5 : 2 can be achieved for 32 32 pixel imageAbstract [...] Illustrations [...] Tables [...] Acknowledgements [...] Introduction [...] Background [...] Photodiode theory and experiment [...] Lateral capacitance [...] Boost converter [...] Cyclic ADC and entropy encoder [...] Conclusion [...] Reference lis...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{prototype}} of an electronic bi-directional interface between the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) and a neuro-controlled hand prosthesis is presented. The system is composed of two Integrated Circuits (ICs) : a standard CMOS device for neural recording and a High Voltage (HV) CMOS device for neural stimulation. The integrated circuits have been realized in two different 0. 35 μm CMOS processes available fromAustriaMicroSystem(AMS). The recoding IC incorporates 8 channels each including the analog front-end and the A/D conversion based on a sigma delta architecture. It has a total area of 16. 8 mm 2 and exhibits an overall power consumption of 27. 2 mW. The neural stimulation IC is able to provide biphasic current pulses to stimulate 8 electrodes independently. A <b>voltage</b> <b>booster</b> generates a 17 V voltage supply in order to guarantee the programmed stimulation current even in case of high impedances at the electrode-tissue interface {{in the order of}} tens of k­. The stimulation patterns, generated by a 5 -bit current DAC, are programmable in terms of amplitude, frequency and pulse width. Due to the huge capacitors of the implemented voltage boosters, the stimulation IC has a wider area of 18. 6 mm 2. In addition, a maximum power consumption of 29 mW was measured. Successful in-vivo experiments with rats having a TIME electrode implanted in the sciatic nerve were carried out, showing the capability of recording neural signals in the tens of microvolts, with a global noise of 7 μVrms, and to selectively elicit the tibial and plantarmuscles using different active sites of the electrode. In order to get a completely implantable interface, a biocompatible and biostable package was designed. It hosts the developed ICs with the minimal electronics required for their proper operation. The package consists of an alumina tube closed at both extremities by two ceramic caps hermetically sealed on it. Moreover, the two caps serve as substrate for the hermetic feedthroughs to enable the device powering and data exchange with the external digital controller implemented on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board. The package has an outer diameter of 7 mm and a total length of 26 mm. In addition, a humidity and temperature sensor was also included inside the package to allow future hermeticity and life-time estimation tests. Moreover, a wireless, wearable and non-invasive EEG recording system is proposed in order to improve the control over the artificial limb,by integrating the neural signals recorded from the PNS with those directly acquired from the brain. To first investigate the system requirements, a Component-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) device was designed. It includes a low-power 8 - channel acquisition module and a Bluetooth (BT) transceiver to transmit the acquired data to a remote platform. It was designed with the aimof creating a cheap and user-friendly system that can be easily interfaced with the nowadays widely spread smartphones or tablets by means of a mobile-based application.
