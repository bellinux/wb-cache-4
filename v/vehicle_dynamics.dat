5|$|HSV E Series 3 or E3 {{commenced}} {{sales in}} 2011. Model {{changes for the}} E series 3 include an option for LPI system (for an extra $5990) allowing the vehicle to run on LPG and unleaded petrol; the LPI system is not available on the ClubSport R8 Tourer. Cosmetic changes include a new spoiler and revised exhaust tips. HSV E Series 3 models reach 0-100kmp in 5.8 seconds. The HSV E Series 3 introduced the new HSV Enhanced Driver Interface; {{it has the same}} interface as the Holden IQ (found in VE Series II Commodores) but with added function. The system allows users to access the car's computer and monitor fuel consumption, stability, g-force and <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics.</b> Other functions include data logging options, digital gauge displays, stopwatch, driver and racing options, along with controls for the Grange's Bi-Modal exhaust and Side Blind-Zone Alert. The HSV Enhanced Driver Interface and satellite navigation is standard across the E series 3 range.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{features}} on Lexus models range from {{stability and handling}} programs (Vehicle Stability Control and <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Dynamics</b> Integrated Management) to backup cameras, swivel headlights, and sonar warning systems. The Lexus Pre-Collision System (PCS) integrates multiple safety systems. In 2007, Lexus introduced the first car safety systems with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities, lane keep assist, a Driver Monitoring System with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness, and rear pre-collision whiplash protection, {{as part of the}} LS 460 PCS. As a safety precaution, Lexus GPS navigation systems in many regions feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed; to prevent distraction, navigation inputs are limited, while voice input and certain buttons are still accessible. This safety feature has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion. Pre-2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override option, and updated European models allow operation in motion.|$|E

25|$|New to the GS {{line was}} an {{electric}} power steering (EPS) system, and both the V8 and hybrid models featured a variable gear ratio steering (VGRS) system and Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB) a type of brake-by-wire system. V8 and hybrid models also featured an adaptive suspension system that individually altered suspension damper firmness. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Dynamics</b> Integrated Management (VDIM) was standard on the GS 430, 460, and 450h models and coupled to VGRS, with which it could alter steering gear ratios.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{self-levelling}} rear {{air suspension}} available in Caprice brought advantages when hauling heavy loads and improved <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> when towing.

25|$|The third-generation RX comes {{standard}} with a twin-chamber {{front passenger}} airbags, side torso airbags {{for the front}} row, side curtain airbags for front and rear rows, and knee airbags for the front row. Active headrests become standard to help reduce whiplash injuries. Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) and Hill Assist Control (HAC) which helps prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards on inclines are standard while a more advanced <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Dynamics</b> Integrated Management (VDIM) system is optional. VDIM {{is designed to be}} more subtle and less intrusive in performance than VSC alone, VDIM can also engage prior to an actual skid taking place acting as a preventative measure. The Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS) remains optional, while a new bi-xenon optional Intelligent Highbeam feature is added, this system can dim the high-beams automatically whenever traffic is detected. Other optional safety features include a Pre-Collision System (PCS) and a Head-up Display (HUD) which helps the driver keep attention on the road ahead by displaying navigation, speed, and audio information on the windshield; the HUD uses high-intensity LEDs displaying high contrast white figures on the windshield allowing it to be read in direct sunlight. The optional navigation system offers a backup camera and a Wide-View Side Monitor utilizes a camera on the passenger side view mirror to help eliminate blind spots on the passenger side at low speeds, this system does not include the 180° wide-angle front camera found in the LX 570. To further help improve visibility, water-repellent glass is used on the front doors.|$|E

It also brought HSV's Enhanced Driver Interface (EDI) system to the Senator, a system that constantly streams real-time <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamics</b> and performance information to the touch screen in the centre console. The exterior remained mostly unchanged from the E2 model apart from the move to a 20" [...] forged alloy that was available in Dark Stainless or Gloss Black.

Design/methodology/approach. Procedure of computer modeling of railway <b>vehicles</b> <b>dynamics</b> is proposed in UM bundled software. As example the flat-car was consider, which is used for high-speed container traffic with railway transport. The dynamic simulation was developed with the assumption of flat-car as the system of solids are constrained with hinged and force coupling elements. General dynamic mode of flat-car consist of the frame and two subsystems of bogies. In part each of these subsystems of bogies consist of two subsystems of wheelsets. The computer simulation allows to realize imitating investigation of influence of characteristics of some elements of running gear on dynamic behavior of flat-car in specified velocity range. Findings. Using the proposed dynamic simulation the dynamic factors of safety of traffic were studied. Originality/value. The proposed dynamic simulation of flat-car allows to estimate its general dynamic characteristics, specifically the indexes of stability against derailment. ???????????? ????????? ????????????? ????????????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ? ??????????? ?????????
