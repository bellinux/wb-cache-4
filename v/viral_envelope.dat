5|$|This is, in turn, {{surrounded}} by the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope,</b> that is composed of the lipid bilayer taken from the membrane of a human cell when the newly formed virus particle buds from the cell. The <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> contains proteins from the host cell and relatively few copies of the HIV Envelope protein, which consists of a cap made of three molecules known as glycoprotein (gp) 120, and a stem consisting of three gp41 molecules which anchor the structure into the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope.</b> The Envelope protein, encoded by the HIV env gene, allows the virus to attach to target cells and fuse the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> with the target cell membrane releasing the viral contents into the cell and initiating the infectious cycle.|$|E
5|$|Both enveloped and unenveloped virions are infectious. The <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> {{is made of}} {{modified}} Golgi membranes containing viral-specific polypeptides, including hemagglutinin. Infection {{with either}} variola major or variola minor confers immunity against the other.|$|E
5|$|The HIV virion enters macrophages and CD4+ T cells by the {{adsorption}} of glycoproteins on {{its surface}} to receptors on the target cell followed by fusion of the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> with the cell membrane {{and the release of}} the HIV capsid into the cell.|$|E
40|$|Insulin {{molecules}} were covalently {{attached to}} detergent-solubilized Sendai virus envelope glycoproteins (HN and F polypeptides) {{by the use}} of the crosslinking reagent succinimidyl 4 -(p-maleimidophenyl) butyrate (SMPB). Reconstitution of modified viral glycoproteins (carrying covalently attached insulin) together with unmodified viral glycoproteins resulted in the formation of "fusogenic" <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes</b> bearing insulin molecules. Reconstitution of such fusogenic <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes</b> in the presence of ricin A or simian virus 40 (SV 40) DNA resulted in the formation of <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes</b> bearing insulin molecules and loaded with ricin A or SV 40 DNA. Such <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes</b> were able to bind to hepatoma tissue culture cells (HTCC) from which Sendai virus receptors were removed by treatment with neuraminidase. Incubation of <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes</b> loaded with ricin A with virus receptor-depleted HTCC resulted in fusion-mediated injection of the toxin, as inferred from inhibition of protein synthesis and decrease in cell viability of the microinjected cells. Fusion-mediated injection of SV 40 DNA was inferred from the appearance of SV 40 tumor antigen in microinjected cells. Binding and fusion of the loaded <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes</b> to neuraminidase-treated HTCC was mediated solely by the virus-associated insulin molecules. Addition of free insulin molecules inhibited binding of the <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes</b> and, consequently, the microinjection of ricin A and SV 40 DNA...|$|R

40|$|This NebGuide {{provides}} cattle {{producers and}} animal health workers {{information to help}} them better select and use disinfectants in their biosecurity program. It {{is important to note}} that selecting and using disinfectants is only a tool in achieving the goal of biosecurity, which is to prevent, minimize or control cross-contamination of infective organisms between animals, from animals to feed and from animals to equipment that may directly or indirectly contact animals. Covers: definitions, selection, types of disinfectants considered; disinfectant selection table; and cattle viruses with and without <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes.</b> Includes tables of attributes to aid with disinfectant selection and cattle viruses with and without <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes...</b>|$|R
5|$|Envelope: Some {{species of}} virus envelop {{themselves}} in a modified form {{of one of the}} cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a <b>viral</b> <b>envelope.</b> This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity.|$|E
5|$|Attachment is a {{specific}} binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes. This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule – a chemokine receptor – which is most commonly found {{on the surface of}} CD4+ T-Cells. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> protein to undergo changes that results in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.|$|E
25|$|Despite these varied shapes, the virions of all {{influenza}} type A viruses {{are similar}} in composition. They are all {{made up of a}} <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> containing two main types of proteins, wrapped around a central core.|$|E
40|$|Using {{a method}} for {{freeze-drying}} intact cells, uninfected and murine leukemia virus (MuLV) -infected JLSV 9 cell surfaces, as well as murine mammary tumor virus (MuMTV) -infected cell surfaces, were examined by electron microscopy. The 10 -nm knobs of MuLV and the 5 -nm spikes of MuMTV were clearly revealed on the surfaces of budding viruses and were also found dispersed over the cell surface. The MuLV knobs are randomly arranged on the virus surface, whereas the MuMTV spikes are much more ordered. Because freeze-fractured budding <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes</b> are devoid of intramembranous particles, the observed surface particles {{do not appear to}} be merely accentuated intramembranous particles. This technique should permit further analysis of the morphogenesis of <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes</b> without the need for externally applied labels...|$|R
40|$|Sendai virus {{envelopes}} {{and human}} erythrocyte band 3 membrane polypeptides were isolated in detergent solutions and coreconstituted into detergent-free vesicle structurally resembling <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes.</b> Formation of hybrid viral envelope-band 3 vesicles (VB 3) was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of VB 3 containing 4, 4 '-diisothiocyano- 2, 2 '-ditritostilbenedisulfonic acid-labeled band 3 {{in the presence}} of antiviral antiserum. The hybrid VB 3 vesicles displayed agglutination, fusion, and hemolytic properties similar to those of reconstituted <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes.</b> Incubation of VB 3 with Friend erythroleukemic cells resulted in fusion-mediated insertion of viral antigens and of band 3 into the plasma membranes of the recipient cells. The presence of band 3 incorporated into Friend erythroleukemic cells was revealed structurally by electron microscopy after staining with ferritin-conjugated anti-human erythrocyte membrane antiserum. Incorporation of band 3, the putative erythrocyte antion channel, led to a marked and specific stimulation of anion exchange in Friend erythroleukemic cells. The viral-mediated insertion of an isolated membrane protein into viable Friend erythroleukemic cells provides a method for studying membrane protein turnover and for assaying reconstituted membrane components such as carriers or channels...|$|R
40|$|Budding of enveloped viruses {{has been}} shown to be driven by {{interactions}} between a nucleocapsid and a proteolipid membrane. By contrast, we here describe the assembly of <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes</b> independent of a nucleocapsid. Membrane particles containing coronaviral envelope proteins were assembled in and released from animal cells co-expressing these proteins' genes from transfected plasmids. Of the three viral membrane proteins only two were required for particle formation, the membrane glycoprotein (M) and the small envelope protein (E). The spike (S) protein was dispensable but was incorporated when present. Importantly, the nucleocapsid protein (N) was neither required not taken into the particles when present. The E protein, recently recognized to be a structural protein, was shown to be an integral membrane protein. The envelope vesicles were found by immunogold labelling and electron microscopy to form a homogeneous population of spherical particles indistinguishable from authentic coronavirions in size (approximately 100 nm in diameter) and shape. They were less dense than virions and sedimented slightly slower than virions in sucrose velocity gradients. The nucleocapsid-independent formation of apparently bona fide <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes</b> represents a novel mode of virus assembly...|$|R
25|$|The {{hepatitis}} C {{virus particle}} {{consists of a}} core of genetic material (RNA), surrounded by an icosahedral protective shell of protein, and further encased in a lipid (fatty) envelope of cellular origin. Two <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> glycoproteins, E1 and E2, are embedded in the lipid envelope.|$|E
25|$|F – {{the fusion}} protein {{projects}} from the envelope surface as a trimer, and mediates cell entry by inducing fusion between the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> and the cell membrane by class I fusion. One of the defining characteristics {{of members of}} the paramyxoviridae family is the requirement for a neutral pH for fusogenic activity.|$|E
25|$|Entry {{into the}} host cell is {{achieved}} by attachment of the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> protein E to host receptors, which mediates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of transcription. Humans, mammals, mosquitoes, and ticks serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are zoonosis and bite.|$|E
40|$|Retroviruses undergo several {{critical}} {{steps to}} complete a replication cycle. These include the complex processes of virus entry, assembly, and budding that often {{take place at the}} plasma membrane of the host cell. Both virus entry and release involve membrane fusion/fission reactions between the <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes</b> and host cell membranes. Accumulating evidence indicates important roles for lipids and lipid microdomains in virus entry and egress. In this review, we outline the current understanding of the role of lipids and membrane microdomains in retroviral replication...|$|R
30|$|Overall, {{this study}} {{provides}} evidences that HCV envelope protein E 2 transport is regulated by its intracellular association with cellular CD 81. The validation of a CD 81 -regulated transport of HCV E 2 to the plasma membrane can further contribute to elucidate understudied aspects of HCV biology such as the biogenesis of infectious HCV-genome containing exosomes present in patients’ serum. In addition, this work grants the possibility to develop HCV E 1 -only particles using non-engineered <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes</b> and {{highlights the importance of}} cellular host proteins for the production of functional vaccine candidates.|$|R
40|$|Morphogenesis of Venezuelan equine {{encephalomyelitis}} virus was studied {{by means of}} electron microscopy. Virus-specific structures (factories, viroplasts) were found at early stages of infection; these structures were composed of fibrillar and cylindrical formations, aggregates of ribosomes, and viral nucleoids. The latter emerged from fibrillar and cylindrical structures. Aggregates of viral nucleoids {{were found in the}} cytoplasm and occasionally in the nuclei of virus-infected cells. <b>Viral</b> <b>envelopes</b> and mature virions were formed on the cell membranes and on the membranes of intracellular vacuoles. Anomalous forms of virions (both polygenomic and oligogenomic) were observed...|$|R
25|$|Hand washing {{with soap}} and water is an {{effective}} method for reducing the transmission of norovirus pathogens. Alcohol rubs (≥62% ethanol) may be used as an adjunct, but are less effective than hand-washing, as norovirus lacks a lipid <b>viral</b> <b>envelope.</b> Surfaces where norovirus particles may be present can be sanitised with a solution of 1.5% to 7.5% of household bleach in water, or other disinfectants effective against norovirus.|$|E
25|$|Hantavirus virions {{are about}} 120-160 {{nanometers}} (nm) in diameter. The lipid bilayer of the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> is about five nm thick and is embedded with viral surface proteins to which sugar residues are attached. These glycoproteins, known as Gn and Gc, are encoded by the M {{segment of the}} viral genome. They tend to associate (heterodimerize) {{with each other and}} have both an interior tail and an exterior domain that extends to about six nm beyond the envelope surface.|$|E
25|$|To enter B cells, viral {{glycoprotein}} gp350 binds to cellular receptor CD21 (also {{known as}} CR2). Then, viral glycoprotein gp42 interacts with cellular MHC class II molecules. This triggers fusion of the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> with the cell membrane, allowing EBV {{to enter the}} B cell. Human CD35, also known as complement receptor 1 (CR1), is an additional attachment factor for gp350/220, and can provide a route for entry of EBV into CD21-negative cells, including immature B-cells. EBV infection downregulates expression of CD35.|$|E
40|$|Antiviral drugs {{targeting}} viral proteins often {{result in}} prompt selection for resistance. Moreover, {{the number of}} viral targets is limited. Novel antiviral targets are therefore needed. The unique characteristics of fusion between virion envelopes and cell membranes may provide such targets. Like all fusing bilayers, <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes</b> locally adopt hourglass-shaped stalks during {{the initial stages of}} fusion, a process that requires local negative membrane curvature. Unlike cellular vesicles, however, <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes</b> do not redistribute lipids between leaflets, can only use the energy released by virion proteins, and fuse to the extracellular leaflets of cell membranes. Enrichment in phospholipids with hydrophilic heads larger than their hydrophobic tails in the convex outer leaflet of vesicles favors positive curvature, therefore increasing the activation energy barrier for fusion. Such phospholipids can increase the activation barrier beyond the energy provided by virion proteins, thereby inhibiting viral fusion. However, phospholipids are not pharmacologically useful. We show here that a family of synthetic rigid amphiphiles of shape similar to such phospholipids, RAFIs (rigid amphipathic fusion inhibitors), inhibit the infectivity of several otherwise unrelated enveloped viruses, including hepatitis C and HSV- 1 and - 2 (lowest apparent IC 50 48 nM), with no cytotoxic or cytostatic effects (selectivity index > 3, 000) by inhibiting the increased negative curvature required for the initial stages of fusion...|$|R

40|$|Regulation of the {{synthesis}} of viral nucleotide phosphohydrolase and neutral DNase was investigated by means of DNA and protein inhibitors. These virus-associated activities, previously localized within viral cores, are introduced into host cells with the infecting inoculum. Nucleotide phosphohydrolase was found throughout the cycle of multiplication in a particulate fraction containing viroplasmic matrices. However, the DNase from the inoculum appeared in the supernatant fraction, and the DNase synthesized after infection {{was associated with the}} particulate material. The two enzymatic activities belong in the category of “late” functions. It now appears that during morphogenesis of the poxviruses several “late” proteins, some with enzymatic properties, are enclosed within the <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes...</b>|$|R
25|$|Viruses {{lacking a}} <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> often have complex {{mechanisms}} {{for entry into}} the host cell. MPyV capsid protein VP1 binds to sialic acids of gangliosides GD1a and GT1b on the cell surface. The functions of VP2 and VP3 are less well understood, but at least VP2 {{has been reported to}} be exposed upon endocytosis of the viral particle and may be involved in releasing the virus from the endoplasmic reticulum. MPyV has been reported to enter cells through both a caveolae-dependent endocytosis mechanism and by an independent mechanism through uncoated vesicles.|$|E
25|$|Entry of HSV into a {{host cell}} {{involves}} several glycoproteins {{on the surface}} of the enveloped virus binding to their transmembrane receptors on the cell surface. Many of these receptors are then pulled inwards by the cell, which is thought to open a ring of three gHgL heterodimers stabilizing a compact conformation of the gB glycoprotein, so that it springs out and punctures the cell membrane. The envelope covering the virus particle then fuses with the cell membrane, creating a pore through which the contents of the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> enters the host cell.|$|E
25|$|Their {{life cycle}} {{is thought to}} begin with a virion {{attaching}} to specific cell-surface receptors such as C-type lectins, DC-SIGN, or integrins, which is followed by fusion of the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> with cellular membranes. The virions taken up by the cell then travel to acidic endosomes and lysosomes where the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> glycoprotein GP is cleaved. This processing appears to allow the virus to bind to cellular proteins enabling it to fuse with internal cellular membranes and release the viral nucleocapsid. The Ebolavirus structural glycoprotein (known as GP1,2) is responsible for the virus' ability to bind to and infect targeted cells. The viral RNA polymerase, encoded by the L gene, partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and transcribes the genes into positive-strand mRNAs, which are then translated into structural and nonstructural proteins. The most abundant protein produced is the nucleoprotein, whose concentration in the host cell determines when L switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication of the viral genome results in full-length, positive-strand antigenomes that are, in turn, transcribed into genome copies of negative-strand virus progeny. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes self-assemble and accumulate near the inside of the cell membrane. Virions bud off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the cellular membrane from which they bud. The mature progeny particles then infect other cells to repeat the cycle. The genetics of the Ebola virus are difficult to study because of EBOV's virulent characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The VLP Lipoparticle was {{developed}} to aid the study of integral membrane proteins. Lipoparticles are stable, highly purified, homogeneous VLPs that are engineered to contain high concentrations of a conformationally intact membrane protein of interest. Integral Membrane proteins are involved in diverse biological functions and are targeted by nearly 50% of existing therapeutic drugs. However, because of their hydrophobic domains, membrane proteins are difficult to manipulate outside of living cells. Lipoparticles can incorporate {{a wide variety of}} structurally intact membrane proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)s, ion channels and <b>viral</b> <b>Envelopes.</b> Lipoparticles provide a platform for numerous applications including antibody screening, production of immunogens and ligand binding assays.|$|R
40|$|N-alpha-Cocoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester, DL-pyroglutamic {{acid salt}} (CAE), {{exhibited}} a strong inactivating effect on hepatitis B surface antigen. Concentrations of CAE required for 50 and 100 % inactivation of the antigen were 0. 01 to 0. 025 % and 0. 025 to 0. 05 % respectively. CAE completely inactivated hepatitis B surface antigen {{at the lowest}} concentration compared with various compounds including about 500 amino acid derivatives, sodium hypochlorite, 2, 4, 4 '-trichloro- 2 '-hydroxydiphenyl ether, and some detergents. Furthermore, CAE inactivated vaccinia virus, herpes simplex virus, and influenza virus, whereas poliovirus was not inactivated at all.

40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) completes {{its final}} envelopment on intracellular membranes {{before it is}} released from the cell. The mechanisms underlying these processes are not understood. Here we studied the role of Rab 27 a, a regulator of lysosome-related organelle transport, in HCMV production. HCMV infection increased Rab 27 a expression, and recruitment of Rab 27 a to membranous strutures at the assembly site. Immuno-gold labelling demonstrated association of Rab 27 a with <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes.</b> CMV production was reduced after knock-down of Rab 27 a, and in Rab 27 a-deficient ashen melanocytes. This study shows a requirement for Rab 27 a in the CMV life cycle and suggests that CMV and LRO biogenesis share common molecular mechanisms...|$|R
25|$|The {{sequential}} {{stages of}} HSV entry are analogous {{to those of}} other viruses. At first, complementary receptors on the virus and the cell surface bring the viral and cell membranes into proximity. Interactions of these molecules then form a stable entry pore through which the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> contents are introduced to the host cell. The virus can also be endocytosed after binding to the receptors, and the fusion could occur at the endosome. In electron micrographs the outer leaflets of the viral and cellular lipid bilayers have been seen merged; this hemifusion may be on the usual path to entry or it may usually be an arrested state more likely to be captured than a transient entry mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The {{two large}} {{proteins}} {{found on the}} outside of viral particles are hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA is a protein that mediates binding of the virion to target cells and entry of the viral genome into the target cell, while NA is involved in the release of progeny virions from infected cells. These proteins are usually the targets for antiviral drugs. Furthermore, they are also the antigen proteins to which a host’s antibodies can bind and trigger an immune response. Influenza type A viruses are categorized into subtypes based on the type of these two proteins {{on the surface of the}} <b>viral</b> <b>envelope.</b> There are 16 subtypes of HA and 9 subtypes of NA known, but only H 1, 2 and 3, and N 1 and 2 are commonly found in humans.|$|E
25|$|The protein gp120 is {{necessary}} {{during the initial}} binding of HIV to its target cell. Consequently, anything which binds to gp120 or its targets can physically block gp120 from binding to a cell. Only one such agent, Maraviroc, which binds the co-receptor CCR5 is currently licensed and in clinical use. No agent targeting gp120's main first cellular interaction partner, CD4, is currently licensed since interfering with such a central molecule {{of the immune system}} can cause toxic side effects, such as the anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody OKT4. Targeting gp120 itself has proven extremely difficult due to its high degree of variability and shielding. Fostemsavir (BMS-663068) is a methyl phosphate prodrug of the small molecule inhibitor BMS-626529, which prevents viral entry by binding to the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> gp120 and interfering with virus attachment to the host CD4 receptor.|$|E
500|$|The most {{controversial}} model, known as viral eukaryogenesis, posits that the membrane-bound nucleus, {{along with other}} eukaryotic features, originated from the infection of a prokaryote by a virus. The suggestion is based on similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such as linear DNA strands, mRNA capping, and tight binding to proteins (analogizing histones to <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes).</b> One version of the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved in concert with phagocytosis to form an early cellular [...] "predator". Another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early archaea infected by poxviruses, {{on the basis of}} observed similarity between the DNA polymerases in modern poxviruses and eukaryotes. It has been suggested that the unresolved question of the evolution of sex could be related to the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSendai virus {{envelopes}} were reconstituted after solubilization of intact virions {{with either}} Triton X- 100 or octylglucoside. Envelopes obtained from Triton X- 100, {{but not from}} octylglucoside solubilized virions, were hemolytic and promoted cell-cell fusion. Fluorescence dequenching studies [using N- 4 -nitrobenzo- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazole phosphatidylethanolamine-bearing viral envelopes] revealed that both preparations fused with negatively charged phospholipids. Fusion with phosphatidylcholine (PC) /cholesterol (chol) liposomes was promoted only by the hemolytic <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes.</b> Fluorescence dequenching studies, using intact virions bearing octadecylrhodamine B chloride, revealed that intact virions fused with PC/chol {{as well as with}} negatively charged phospholipids.

40|$|Artificial {{mixtures}} of plasma membrane vesicles produced by microcavitation from infected and uninfected cells band {{at the same}} density on isopycnic centrifugation in sucrose density gradient. However, after reaction with antiviral antibody, {{the density of the}} infected cell plasma membrane vesicles increases, and the infected and uninfected cell membranes are quantitatively separable on isopycnic centrifugation. Plasma membrane vesicles prepared from cells doubly labeled before and after infection with radioactive amino acids and reacted with antibody banded at a high density. Polyacrylamide gel electropherograms show that the vesicles reacted with antibody consist of both host- and virus-specific membrane proteins. Microcavitation does not disrupt <b>viral</b> <b>envelopes</b> since infectivity is not affected by this procedure. We conclude that viral and cellular proteins in the plasma membrane preparations are contiguous...|$|R
