50|$|Alongside {{the launch}} of the AOS in 2007, DVLA {{announced}} that any company/organisation accessing <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Keeper</b> data via an electronic request process that is not a Local Authority or Government Organisation must be a member of an Accredited Trade Association (ATA).|$|E
5000|$|For every railway that enters its {{tractive}} units {{into the}} register, a clear European-wide code is needed, {{separate from the}} number. This alphanumerical <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Keeper</b> Marking (VKM) is allocated by a railway administration in accordance with CR OPE TSI. The list of keeper codes is linked below. (The keeper will be different to {{the owner of a}} vehicle where a leasing agreement is in force.) ...|$|E
50|$|On the register, {{along with}} the vehicle details (make, model, engine capacity, colour, VIN, etc.) are {{recorded}} {{the details of the}} current keeper of the vehicle (name, address). The current keeper is issued with a registration document known as a V5C, which displays the registration details of the vehicle. Each time any of the registration details change, if the <b>vehicle</b> <b>keeper</b> is changed, or any of the vehicle details are changed, for example, the DVLA/DVLNI has to be notified, and a new document is issued.|$|E

5000|$|When {{a vehicle}} {{is alleged to}} have been {{involved}} in an offence, section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, as amended by section 21 of the Road Traffic Act 1991 enables the police to require the <b>vehicle's</b> registered <b>keeper,</b> or any other relevant person, to provide information as to the identity of the vehicle's driver. A special warning is given indicating that refusal to do so constitutes an offence in itself.|$|R
50|$|The RTO {{identifies}} untaxed <b>vehicles,</b> {{and identify}} <b>keepers</b> of cars entering various Indian states, or who exceed speed limits {{on a road}} that has speed cameras by matching the cars to their keepers utilising the RTO database. The High Security Registration plates (HSRP) was introduced to help reduce vehicle crime and improve security. It is intended to deter criminals from disguising stolen cars with the identity of written off or scrapped vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The {{railway vehicle}} owner's code formed {{part of the}} vehicle number {{on the side of}} a railway coach or wagon. Until 2005 it was used to specify the owner of the wagon. However, the owner code did not {{necessarily}} reflect ownership of a vehicle but rather who had the right to use it. Since then the owner code has been replaced by the UIC country code. The keeper of a vehicle is now indicated with a <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Keeper</b> Marking (VKM). The table shows the former numbers used.|$|E
5000|$|A {{railway vehicle}} must be {{registered}} {{in a national}} vehicle register (NVR) using a 12-digit number derived from the old UIC system of vehicle numbering. The number contains the register country {{in the third and}} fourth digit. The keeper of a vehicle is indicated with a company abbreviation of maximum five letters, called <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Keeper</b> Marking (VKM) which must be registered with OTIF and ERA [...] and is unique throughout Europe and parts of Asia and Northern Africa. The VKM must not contain special signs or digits.|$|E
40|$|In 2003, Mitchell and Dorling {{undertook}} {{the first}} national level environmental justice analysis of air quality in Britain and established that there were clear inequalities in exposure to air pollution based on demography, poverty and car ownership. This paper updates and improves on their work looking at relationships between emissions and exposure a decade later. Using 2011 pollution data (NO 2 concentrations and NOx emissions from road transport) in combination with socio-economic and demographic data from the UK Census, we present analyses of patterns of exposure {{at the level of}} small area census units. Then, using an enhanced version of the UK Department for Transport’s annual vehicle safety inspection records, we spatially attribute the annual NOx emissions for private motor vehicles to the location of each <b>vehicle’s</b> registered <b>keeper.</b> From this, it is possible to identify who are the highest emitters of traffic related pollution and to explore the relationships between responsibility for causing emissions and exposure to pollution. The research focuses on England and Wales and finds that despite a decade of efforts to reduce air pollution, significant inequalities still characterise exposure. Young children and adults, and households in poverty {{are much more likely to}} suffer from the effects of traffic than older people and more affluent households. Furthermore, it is these more affluent households that contribute most to traffic pollution through owning the most vehicles and generating the highest emissions...|$|R
