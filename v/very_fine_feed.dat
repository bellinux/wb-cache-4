40|$|The Niobec {{concentrator}} recovers niobium minerals (principally pyrochlore) from carbonate and silicate gangue. In {{the process}} some 15 % of the Nb is rejected in a slimes ($-$ 10 $ mu$m) product. Recovery of pyrochlore from the slimes was studied. The study was performed using plant water which contained about 200 ppm Ca, 100 ppm Mg and variable quantities of organics {{as the main}} contaminants. Selective pyrochlore collectors and selective silicate depressants were evaluated. Four possible routes to float pyrochlore selectively were found. All routes required prior carbonate flotation. Carbonate flotation was attempted using fatty acids and sodium silicate dispersant (as conducted at Niobec) in a flotation column. However, pyrochlore also floated {{as a result of}} inadequate dispersion of the slimes. Therefore, new dispersants were tested, which proved effective only at high concentration, because reaction with Ca and Mg cations in the water. High dispersant concentration caused carbonate depression. An additional problem in the flotation column was bubble coalescence and collapse of the froth. This was caused by the fatty acids, enhanced by the high dispersant concentration. A novel method of quantifying coalescence using the change in gas holdup in the column was developed. A stable froth could be made at high fatty acid emulsifier concentration, but his promoted unselective flotation. Only by working at high percent solids (10 % vs 1 %) could sufficient emulsifier be introduced into solution without exceeding the dosage (per unit mass of solids) above which flotation is unselective. For such high percent solids work must be conducted at plant site. Preliminary plant column work was encouraging. Extensive testwork on <b>very</b> <b>fine</b> <b>feeds</b> (80 % $-$ 20 $ mu$m) at Niobec, and at Mt Isa Mines (Australia) confirmed that column flotation is ideal for selective flotation of fines principally due to reduced gangue entrainment...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to discriminate maize inbred lines byevaluating root characteristics obtained by digital images analysis when different nitrogen (N) rates were applied. Six maize inbred lines from Embrapa Maize and Sorghum were grown in five liter pots containing Red Latosol – medium textured, and two different N rates (zero and 2 mmol. L- 1) were used. Nitrogen was applied as ammonium nitrate. A randomized complete blocks design was used, with three replications. Root and shoot features were evaluated on plants harvested 23 days after sowing. Significant interactions were observed between strains and N rates for root length, root surface area, <b>very</b> <b>fine</b> root length, surface area of <b>very</b> <b>fine</b> roots, surface area of thick roots, <b>very</b> <b>fine</b> root volume, shoot dry matter and total dry matter. The inbred line CMS 28 - 7. 1 showed a lower <b>very</b> <b>fine</b> root volume/total root volume ratio compared to the other inbred lines.
