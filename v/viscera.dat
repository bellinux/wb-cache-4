40|$|Background: Anti-epileptic {{drugs are}} known to be the risk of teratogenicity. Topiramate (TPM) is a new kind of such drug, for which no {{research}} has confirmed the incidence of producing congenital abnormalities. Objective: This study was conducted to study the teratogenic effects of TPM by using chick embryos as an animal model and the results can be compared to the human embryo of the same stage. Methods: Fertilized Leghorn hen eggs were injected in ovo with two concentrations of TPM, which were 10 mg, and 20 mg, in NSS at a volume of 0. 1 ml into the yolk sac at 21 hrs of incubation and repeated injections at 72 hrs at a volume of 0. 05 ml. The chick embryos on day 3, 6 and 11 of incubation were sacrificed and all living embryos were processed for total mount and serial section. Results: The mortality rate increased corresponding to the concentrations of TPM, and the embryonic stage. The total mount of day 3 showed major abnormalities of the eye and heart, such as microphthalmia and looser of heart looping. The serial section of day 3 showed opening of the anterior neuropore, ectopia <b>viscerae</b> and multiple malformations of the eye and heart. Day 6 chick embryos showed ectopia cordis and ectopia <b>viscerae.</b> Moreover, there were retardation and abnormalities of several organs such as eye, heart, liver, mesonephros and gonads. Day 11 chick embryos showed ectopia <b>viscerae</b> and several growth retardations, retardation of ossification of both limb bones and skull bones. Conclusion: This study showed that TPM might cause embryonic death, growth retardation and abnormalities of the eye, heart, an opening of the anterior neuropore and ectopia <b>viscerae.</b> This might indicate abnormalities to the baby born from mother with gestational epilepsy who was taking this drug continuously, and it might lead to spontaneous abortion or congenital anomalies of the fetus...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} produce and nutritionally {{characterize}} the ostrich offal meal, and to evaluate its digestible value for Nile tilapia. The relevance of the study lies {{in the possibility of}} using by-products from the food industry as alternative food for animals. For this, chemical and microbiological analyses were performed, as well as digestibility trial in the meal produced with ostrich offal for Nile tilapia. The levels found for protein, lipids, gross energy and minerals were 71. 08 %, 16. 54 %, 5115 kcal kg- 1 and 5. 62 %, respectively. Microbiological analysis showed absence of Salmonella spp. in the product. The digestibility of protein was 90. 41 %, and of energy was 77. 65 %, while the phosphorus availability was 80. 18 %. Therefore, the ostrich offal meal proved to be a by-product with good nutritional profile and significant digestibility to be used in diets for Nile tilapia.

5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the <b>viscera,</b> although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E

Ocorreram variações quanto à composição química dos alimentos protéicos testados neste experimento, em relação aos valores citados na literatura. Os valores encontrados de energia metabolizável aparente e energia metabolizável aparente corrigida pelo balanço de nitrogênio em kcal/kg de alimento foram, respectivamente: farinha de <b>vísceras</b> de aves: 2. 609 e 2. 329 na primeira idade, e 2. 735 e 2. 664 na segunda idade; farinha de penas: 2. 551 e 2. 401 na primeira idade, e 2. 744 e 2. 641 na segunda idade; farinha de penas e vísceras: 2. 352 e 2. 155 na primeira idade, e 2. 500 e 2. 434 na segunda idade; farelo de soja: 2. 248 e 2. 046 na primeira idade, e 2. 294 e 2. 249 na segunda idade. Não houve influência da idade sobre os valores de energia metabolizável aparente, entretanto a idade influenciou os valores de energia metabolizável aparente corrigida pelo balanço de nitrogênio dos alimentos analisados. Four proteic feeds {{chemical composition}} were evaluated, {{as well as}} the age effect in meat quails on the values of apparent metabolizable energy (AME) and the apparent corrected by the nitrogen balance (AMEn). The feeds tested were poultry by-product meal, feather meal, poultry by-product meal and feather meal and soybean meal, which have substituted 30 % of the reference diet. It was utilized the total excrement collection, with 250 quails, males, in two different growth stages (20 to 25 and 35 to 40 days old). The experimental delineation utilized was the completely casual, in factorial scheme 4 x 2 (4 feeds x 2 periods) with 5 replicates per treatment, of 10 quails each one. Variation occurred referring to the chemical composition of the proteic feeds tested at this experiment, related to the cited values in the literature. The energy values found of apparent metabolizable energy and the apparent metabolizable energy corrected by the nitrogen balance in kcal/kg of feed were, respectively: poultry by-product meal: 2. 609 and 2. 329 at the first age, and 2. 735 and 2. 664 at the second age; feather meal: 2. 551 and 2. 401 at the first age, and 2. 744 and 2. 641 at the second age; poultry by-product meal and feather meal: 2. 352 and 2. 155 at the first age, and 2. 500 and 2. 434 at the second age; soybean meal: 2. 248 and 2. 046 at the first age, and 2. 294 and 2. 249 at the second age. It didn’t have influence of the age at the apparent metabolizable energy values, otherwise the age influenced the apparent metabolizable energy values corrected by the nitrogen balance of the analyzed feeds...|$|R
