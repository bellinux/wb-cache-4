The {{aim of this}} study is to characterize language acquisition as it is visible through negotiation of meaning routines. Tandem through desktop videoconference is a type of telecollaboration (Belz & Thorne, 2006) where two learners of different mother tongues cooperatively learn each other's language (Helmling, 2002). We adopt an approach combining tools from the input-interaction framework (Gass, 1997) and the study of multimodal interactions through desktop videoconference (Develotte et al., 2011) in order to study three different types of negotiations of meaning in both languages. Cet article analyse les interactions par <b>visioconférence</b> d'apprenants en tandem étudiant le français et le chinois langues étrangères. Notre but est de comprendre les dynamiques d'acquisition par l'observation des routines de négociations du sens. Le tandem par <b>visioconférence</b> est un type de télécollaboration (Belz & Thorne, 2006) où deux apprenants de langue maternelle différente interagissent pour s'entraider réciproquement dans leurs apprentissages (Helmling, 2002). Nous adoptons les perspectives du cadre input-interaction (Gass, 1997) et de l'analyse des interactions multimodales par vidéoconférence (Develotte et al., 2011) afin d'étudier trois types de négociations du sens dans les deux langues...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology allowing {{the implementation of}} quality of service management mechanisms in PNSVS (Petri Net Synchronized <b>Visioconference</b> System), an application {{on top of an}} asynchronous environment. It describes the mechanisms allowing the system to enforce the synchronization between the audio and video streams of PNSVS, the presentation quality, and the end to end delay. This synchronization method rely on a formal model extending time Petri nets : the Time Stream Petri Net model (TSPN), that completely specify the time constraints of the application streams. From this, the use of a partial order transport service improving the PNSVS quality of service is described. The order principle is presented together with the pre-synchronization sub-layer, that makes the partial order transport service match the applicative synchronization requirements. Moreover, it will be shown that each layer of this synchronization architecture has to be modeled using a particular extended version of the TSPN model. 1. Introductio...|$|E

When {{somebody}} needs to be assisted on a manual task, classical technical support methods such as phone or <b>visioconference</b> rapidly show their limits {{in terms of human}} interaction. By allowing a distant expert to see exactly what an operator is seeing, he could interact with him in interactive time thanks to augmented reality via an adequate interaction paradigm named "Picking Outlining Adding". By "simulating" co-presence of the expert close to the operator through visual guidance information, ambiguity of language and difficulty of communication are avoided, and operations are easily performed. Scientific experimentation we have conducted and we describe in this article shows the teaching interest and the efficiency of this new mode of communication. The operator learns and operates more rapidly, in complete serenity, increasing reliability of his tasks. Moreover, throughout this paper, we show that the developed principles are sufficiently general to be applied to other use cases of tele-assistance that go beyond the originally planned industrial maintenance...|$|E

For the first time in France an attempt of <b>visioconferencing</b> was made between two different installfeists via videoconferencing tools such as Ekiga or XMPP protocol.|$|R
40|$|International audienceFuture {{multimedia}} services platforms {{will allow}} the user to access and consume a rich set of multimedia content over dynamic and heterogeneous networks and devices. To rich this universal accessibility, the MPEG- 21 multimedia framework is defining a normative open framework for the entire multimedia content delivery chain (content creation, production, delivery, trade and consumption). The forthcoming communication systems (IPTV, IPPhone, <b>visioconference,</b> etc) have to support the user's needs, the terminal capabilities, the content specification and the underlying networking technologies. In these new systems the QoS should be maintained across network domains (horizontally) and across network layers (vertically) which lead to crosslayer QoS interaction. This paper presents an architecture and implementation of IPTV service delivery enhanced by an MPEG- 21 cross-layer QoS adaptation. The proposed system allows seamless IPTV access for heterogeneous devices and networks capabilities. The MPEG- 21 framework is used to provide a common support for implementing and managing the end-to-end QoS. Extensive performance evaluations using an experimental test-bed show the ability of our architecture to allow universal media access to digital content for a multitude of clients. Moreover, the proposed cross-layer QoS reduces considerably packet loss and enhances the perceived quality of the IPTV service...|$|E
40|$|Policy Transfer or Innovation ? The Remote Jurisdictional Activity in France In French law, foreign {{examples}} and {{the mechanisms of}} policy transfer have {{played a significant role}} in the genesis and development of the use of videoconferencing to remotely carry out judicial activities such as judging, pleading and sentencing. In the case studied here, references to the international dimension are more than a simple source of borrowing; they constitute strategically mobilized resources. These are part of a more global process of innovation deployed by promoters of videoconferencing according to a particular and incremental logic. The approach developed to grasp the multiple dynamics at work as well as the consistently singular character of this process of innovation is inspired by the sociology of science and techniques. In a more general way, this borrowing demonstrates that the notion of policy transfer is not always the most heuristic for describing and understanding changes in public action and that the sociology of innovation can, in certain conditions, be particularly useful. Cet article s'intéresse au rôle des exemples étrangers dans le processus de genèse des audiences à distance, c'est-à-dire de cette innovation organisationnelle qui consiste à équiper les activités juridictionnelles de dispositifs de <b>visioconférence.</b> Il propose de mettre en évidence l'intérêt et les limites d'un raisonnement en termes de policy transfer pour expliquer ce processus de genèse...|$|E
50|$|Video publishing: Art Planet, the {{interactive}} museum. In 1989, Natan Karczmar created the bimonthly Art Planet video magazine which was distributed in one hundred modern and contemporary art museums around the world. In {{the framework of}} Art Planet, he organizes the Interactive Museum with real time visits at distance of museum exhibitions by using amplified telephone, video and slides, prefiguring thus Internet <b>visioconferencing.</b> The first presentation of the Interactive Museum happened in 1989 at the Art Planet Pavillon with the collaboration of the French FR3 broadcasting station, at the Grand palais, in Paris, during L'Europe des Créateurs event. Interactive Museum events were also held in 1992 at the UNESCO International Council of Museums congress in Quebec. He presented Art Planet in 1989 at the Canadian museums meeting at the Canadian Museum of Civilisation, in Hull, in Canada, and at the American museums meeting in New-Orleans, USA.|$|R
