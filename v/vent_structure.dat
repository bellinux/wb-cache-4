Field investigations were followed up by strontium, neodymium and lead isotope determination, complimented with major, trace and rare earth elements, {{for a host}} of igneous rock compositions ranging from basaltic to rhyolitic as well as metamorphic basement rocks. This study was undertaken in order to better understand: (i) the generation of voluminous felsic magmas, (ii) the underlying crustal structure of this part of Scotland and (iii) the temporal evolution of these large igneous centres forming on the thinned and stretched pre-rift North Atlantic Margin. Detailed new field investigations carried out on the Isle of Rum further delineate the numerous felsic igneous rocks at this centre. Rhyodacite ignimbrites are mapped out and correlations across the island are suggested. In addition, these sequences appear linked to a large <b>vent</b> <b>structure</b> discovered in the south of the island. The significance of mafic xenoliths and inclusions entrained within the Am Mam-type intrusion breccias must be considered in order to fully understand the magmatic evolution of the Rum Centre. These xenoliths characterize the earliest mafic magmas which led to large-scale crustal anatexis.

40|$|Fluid <b>venting</b> <b>structures</b> {{are used}} to {{evaluate}} fluid migration in the subsurface and vertical changes in their morphology reflect variations in the intensity of fluid leakage through time. This research uses high-resolution 3 D seismic data from the Lower Congo Basin offshore Angola to analyse complex assemblages of vertically-stacked fluid venting systems in the Middle Miocene to Holocene succession. Individual fluid-venting structures that form part of vertical venting systems include conical pockmarks, fluid related shallow depressions with flat bottom, chimney structures and positive high amplitude anomalies (PHAAs). Detailed seismic interpretation reveals {{for the first time}} that chimneys and PHAAs have a variety of plan form geometries (circular through to linear) within a given vertical succession of fluid <b>venting</b> <b>structures.</b> Linear chimneys are often associated with PHAAs which are interpreted as deposits of methane-related carbonate. The geometry and depth of depressions associated with fluid <b>venting</b> <b>structures</b> {{are used to}} infer relative rates of fluid flux or intensity of the fluid eruption. This classification scheme is as follows; linear PHAAs and conduits (slow fluid venting), sub-circular PHAAs and shallow depressions (slow to moderate rates of venting), pockmarks (fast rates of fluid venting). Two new types of pockmarks are identified based on the architecture of the sediments which infill them. They include advancing pockmark arrays and nested pockmarks. In contrast to normal pockmarks which are stacked vertically, successions of nested pockmarks and advancing pockmark arrays are laterally offset and migrate laterally, typically downslope. The reactivated craters of advancing pockmarks erode the downstream margin of preceding and underlying infill sequences whilst the infill sequence of nested pockmarks migrate gently downslope but without eroding the underlying and preceding infill sequence. Nested pockmarks and advancing pockmark arrays are confined to inclined surfaces. Downslope migration is a product of the interplay between slope inclination, sedimentation rate and bottom current activity. The trails of nested pockmarks and advancing pockmarks cluster above the axis of gas-bearing turbidite channels. PHAAs, chimneys, a present day bottom simulating reflector and negative high amplitude pockmark infills also occur in these areas and pockmarks occur above crestal faults which root in underlying rollover anticline. This implies the fluid source was derived from depth in the turtle anticline structure. The presence of negative, high-amplitude pockmark infills may suggest the fluid source was gas. A detailed spatial analysis and characterization of fluid <b>venting</b> <b>structures</b> on successive horizons in the middle Miocene to Holocene succession indicates that their distribution and type are affected by tectonic structures and vertical changes in the nature of the host sediments. Linear chimneys occur vertically below Linear PHAAs. The former are occur within the polygonally faulted interval whilst the later occur at the top of above the polygonally faulted interval. They tend to cluster in parts of the basin where the orientations of polygonal faults are strongly perturbed such as around salt diapirs and in salt-withdrawal synclines. Both linear <b>venting</b> <b>structures</b> are interpreted to post-date polygonal fault growth. Linear chimneys and linear PHAAs both have a close spatial and geometric relationship with PFs and deeper extending salt-related faults. The parallel relationship between linear <b>venting</b> <b>structures</b> and adjacent faults (salt or compaction related) are attributed to development and alignment of vertical hydraulic fractures (vertical conduits for linear chimneys) in the local fault induced stress field which subsequently provides fluid migration pathways. A model of vertical fluid migration through the polygonally faulted interval is proposed it involved initial fault-bound trapping, sealing and overpressure beneath an impermeable horizon in the lower part of the PF tier in the early stages, and vertical breaching, hydraulic fracturing and vertical fluid rise through the upper part of the tier in the later stages. Vertical changes in the morphology and type of fluid <b>venting</b> <b>structures</b> occur across small vertical transitions which reflect changes in gross lithology from fine-grained hemipelagites to chaotic and heterogeneous mass transport deposits (MTDs). A linear zone of positive high amplitude anomalies, referred to as a linear venting network, transitions to an array of elongate-to-sub circular shallow depressions with flat bases or conical pockmarks at the upper surface of MTDs. Further changes occur above MTDs where honeycomb pockmarks, so-called based on their hexagonal-shaped perimeter which coincides with polygonal fault intersections, exist. In these cases vertical changes in the type of fluid <b>venting</b> <b>structures</b> are attributed to contrasting patterns of mechanical failure in different sediment when subject to fluid overpressure. Although individual linear chimneys and PHAAs post-dating polygonal growth are strongly affected by the location and orientation of PFs those which precede polygonal fault growth such as pockmarks can affect the orientation of PFs. For example deep pockmark craters with the steepest sidewall inclinations coincide with overlying concentrically aligned PFs yet those which are shallower and have gently dipping sidewalls coincide with more isotropic PF patterns. This suggests that the topographic relief of pockmark craters or compaction above craters of certain depths perturb the stress state within sediments where polygonal faults form. This thesis has demonstrated that seismic interpretation of vertical successions of different types of fluid <b>venting</b> <b>structures</b> can be used to reconstruct spatial variations in the intensity of fluid flow at different stages in the evolution of basins...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{hydrates}} {{have been}} found in the near-bottom sediments within gas <b>venting</b> <b>structures</b> in the southern basin of Lake Baikal. The Baikal basin consists of three subbasins, separated by accommodation zones: the Academician Ridge between the north and central basins, the Selenga Delta Accommodation Zone between the central and south basins. The <b>venting</b> <b>structures</b> are located south of the Posolskiy Bank, which is a basement ridge with a thick sequence of sediments on top, trending NE, oblique to the main border fault. The Posolskiy Bank belongs to the Selenga Delta Accommodation Zone. It is delimited at its south-eastern side by the Posolskiy Fault with a displacement of more than 1000 metres. The <b>venting</b> <b>structures</b> are located close to an ENE trending fault, parallel to the Posolskiy Fault. Besides the fault which is delimiting the venting area at its northern side, and which has a vertical offset of its northern footwall of 25 - 30 metres, a fault with a vertical offset of its eastern footwall is not more than 5 metres. The venting area corresponds to a zone of local elevation of the lake floor, which is delimited at its northern side by the ENE trending fault and which is gently dipping towards SW in its southern part. It consequently appears as a zone of updoming probably related to a fluid and gas flow from depth, finally disrupted along its northern and eastern sides. The updoming is interpreted as the consequence of the disruption of the deep gas hydrate layer resulting from fluid overpressure. This interpretation is favoured by the regional pattern of the BSR, which shows strong variations in depth over this part of the south Baikal basin: it reaches minimum depths in the venting area and drops abruptly down to significantly larger depths north of the fault delimiting the venting area. The upward migration of the BSR is interpreted as a consequence of a regional fluid flow at depth, resulting in heat transport, consequent upward migration of the gas hydrates stability zone, updoming of the area and finally disruption along a fault zone. The origin of the fluid flow is discussed. Folding structures in the lake sediments along a NW-SE to WNW-ESE trend have been described {{in different parts of the}} central and southern basins. These folding structures are assumed to be related to left-lateral strike-slip movements along the eastern side of the basin. In this assumption, the NE trending fault associated with the <b>venting</b> <b>structures</b> and the spatial alignment of the structures themselves would correspond to the direction of extension associated with the left-lateral strike-slip, whereas the NW oriented direction of compression would correspond to the fluid flow...|$|R

40|$|Caldera {{collapse}} changes {{volcanic eruption}} behavior and mass flux. Many models of caldera formation predict that those changes in eruption dynamics result from changes in conduit and <b>vent</b> <b>structure</b> {{during and after}} collapse. Unfortunately, no previous studies have quantified or described how conduits change in response to caldera collapse. Changes in pumice texture coincident with caldera formation during the 1800 14 C yr BP KS 1 eruption of Ksudach Volcano, Kamchatka, {{provide an opportunity to}} constrain magma decompression rates before and after collapse and thus estimate changes in conduit geometry. Prior to caldera collapse, only white rhyodacite pumice with few microlites and elongate vesicles were erupted. Following collapse, only gray rhyodacite pumice containing abundant microlites and round vesicles were erupted. Bulk compositions, phase assemblages, phenocryst compositions, and geothermometry of the two pumice types are indistinguishable, thus the two pumice types originated from the same magma. Geothermobarometry and phase equilibria experiments indicate that magma was stored at 100 – 125 MPa and 895 ± 5 °C prior to eruption. Decompression experiments suggest microlite textures observed in the white pumice require decompression rates of > 0. 01 MPa s− 1, whereas the textures of gray pumice require decompression at ~ 0. 0025 MPa s− 1. Balancing those decompression rates with eruptive mass fluxes requires conduit size to have increased by a factor of ~ 4 during caldera collapse. Slower ascent through a broader conduit following collapse is also consistent with the change from highly stretched vesicles present in white pumice and to round vesicles in gray pumice. Numerical modeling suggests that the mass flux and low decompression rates during the Gray phase can be accommodated by the post-collapse conduit developing a very broad base and narrow upper region...|$|E
40|$|The {{structures}} and textures of the rhyolite in the Mule Creek vent (New Mexico, USA) indicate {{mechanisms by which}} volatiles escape from silicic magma during eruption. The vent outcrop is a 300 -m-high canyon wall comprising a section through {{the top of a}} feeder conduit, vent and the base of an extrusive lava dome. Field relations show that eruption began with an explosive phase and ended with lava extrusion. Analyses of glass inclusions in quartz phenocrysts from the lava indicate that the magma had a pre-eruptive dissolved water content of 2. 5 – 3. 0 wt% and, during eruption, the magma would have been water-saturated over the vertical extent of the present outcrop. However, the vesicularity of the rhyolite is substantially lower than that predicted from closed-system models of vesiculation under equilibrium conditions. At a given elevation in the vent, the volume fraction of primary vesicles in the rhyolite increases from zero close to the vent margin to values of 20 – 40 vol. % in the central part. In the centre the vesicularity increases upward from approximately 20 vol. % at 300 m below the canyon rim to approximately 40 vol. % at 200 m, above which it shows little increase. To account for the discrepancy between observed vesicularity and measured water content, we conclude that gas escaped during ascent, probably beginning at depths greater than exposed, by flow through the vesicular magma. Gas escape was most efficient near the vent margin, and we postulate that this is due both to the slow ascent of magma there, giving the most time for gas to escape, and to shear, favouring bubble coalescence. Such shear-related permeability in erupting magma is supported by the preserved distribution of textures and vesicularity in the rhyolite: Vesicles are flattened and overlapping near the dense margins and become progressively more isolated and less deformed toward the porous centre. Local zones have textures which suggest the coalescence of bubbles to form permeable, collapsing foams, implying the former existence of channels for gas migration. Local channelling of gas into the country rocks is suggested by the presence of sub-horizontal syn-eruptive rhyolitic tuffisite veins which depart from the vent margin and invade the adjacent country rock. In {{the central part of the}} vent, similar local channelling of gas is indicated by steep syn-eruption tuffisite veins which cut the rhyolite itself. We conclude that the suppression of explosive eruption resulted from gas separation from the ascending magma and <b>vent</b> <b>structure</b> by shear-related porous flow and channelling of gas through tuffisite veins. These mechanisms of gas loss may be responsible for the commonly observed transition from explosive to effusive behaviour during the eruption of silicic magma...|$|E

40|$|Methane, {{which is}} at least partly stored in the bottom sediments of Lake Baikal as gas hydrates, is {{released}} on the lake floor in the deeper parts of the basin along major faults, forming <b>venting</b> <b>structures</b> similar to small mud volcanoes. The CH 4 <b>venting</b> <b>structures</b> {{are considered to be}} the surface expression of escape pathways for excess CH 4 generated by the dissociation of pre-existing hydrates. The existence of a local heat flow anomaly associated with the seep area is most likely due to a heat pulse causing the dissociation of the underlying gas hydrates. The heat pulse may be caused by upward flow of geothermal fluids along segments of active faults, possibly accelerated by seismic pumping. It is assumed that this fluid flow is tectonically triggered, considering that left-lateral strike-slip movements along the border faults act as a major factor in fluid accumulation: even a reduced lateral displacement is able to generate fluid flow in the compressional direction, resulting in fluid escape along faults directed along the main direction of extension. The tectonic effect may be coupled to the sediment compaction due to a high sedimentation rate in the area of mud volcanism. Both processes may generate a large-scale convective fluid loop within the basin-fill sediments which advects deeper gases and fluids to the shallow sub-surface. Even in the extensional tectonic environment of Lake Baikal, local compressional forces related to a strike-slip component, {{may play a role in}} fluid flow, accumulation and gas escape along active faults.

The study area lies in the hanging wall of the Posolsky fault in the Southern Baikal Basin (SBB). Side-scan sonar imagery already revealed an undulating antithetic active fault structure and several isolated active <b>vent</b> <b>structures.</b> Remarkably, these fluid discharge structures occur only where {{the base of the}} hydrate stability zone (BHSZ), as inferred from seismic reflection profiles, is fluctuating and discontinuous, independent of lake floor morphology. The correlation between the interpreted BHSZ and heat-flow data across the Malenki seep is reasonable. On a seismic profile south of the fluid escape features, the BHSZ is expressed as an oscillatory, but continuous reflection, and shows poor correlation with heat-flow measurements. In nearly all cases, measured heat-flow exceeds inferred heat-flow. Additionally, the local inferred minima are anomalously low compared to the expected background values in the SBB. These observations suggest that the present-day hydrate accumulation and its (meta-) stability are more complicated than originally suspected. The limited area of these anomalies, their amplitudes and their occurrence in the immediate vicinity of faults and fluid escape features suggest that fluid convection cells disturb local gas hydrate stability conditions...|$|R

Specifically, we use high-resolution Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) topography to constrain channel and flow dimensions, and thus estimate the thermal pulse from the emplaced lava into the substrate and the resulting melting durations and refreezing intervals. These preliminary thermal models indicate that the observed flows could easily create thermal pulse(s) sufficient to melt enough ground ice to fill the observed fluvial small outflow channels. Depending on flow eruption timing and hydraulic recharge times, this system could easily have produced multiple thermal pulses and fluvial releases. This specific case suggests that regional small water releases from similar cases may be more common than suspected, {{and that there is a}} possibility for future fluvial releases if ground ices are currently present and future volcanic eruptions in this young region are possible...|$|R

40|$|Many {{prospective}} sedimentary basins {{contain a}} variety of extrusive volcanic products that are ultimately sourced from volcanoes. However, seismic reflection-based studies of magmatic rift basins have {{tended to focus on}} the underlying magma plumbing system, meaning that the seismic characteristics of volcanoes are not well understood. Additionally, volcanoes have similar morphologies to hydrothermal vents, which are also linked to underlying magmatic intrusions. In this study, we use high resolution 3 D seismic and well data from the Bass Basin, offshore southern Australia, to document 34 cone- and crater-type vents of Miocene age. The vents overlie magmatic intrusions and have seismic properties indicative of a volcanic origin: their moderate–high amplitude upper reflections and zones of “wash-out” and velocity pull-up beneath. The internal reflections of the vents are similar to those found in lava deltas, suggesting they are composed of volcaniclastic material. This interpretation is corroborated by data from exploration wells which penetrated the flanks of several vents. We infer that the vents we describe are composed of hyaloclastite and pyroclasts produced during submarine volcanic eruptions. The morphology of the vents is typical of monogenetic volcanoes, consistent with the onshore record of volcanism on the southern Australian margin. Based on temporal, spatial and volumetric relationships, we propose that submarine volcanoes can evolve from maars to tuff cones as a result of varying magma-water interaction efficiency. The morphologies of the volcanoes and their links to the underlying feeder systems are superficially similar to hydrothermal vents. This highlights the need for careful seismic interpretation and characterization of <b>vent</b> <b>structures</b> linked to magmatic intrusions within sedimentary basins...|$|R
40|$|During R. V. Sonne cruise SO 191 - 3, {{part of the}} New (Zealand Cold) Vents expedition, RCMG {{deployed}} a CHEROKEE ROV Genesis on the Hikurangi Margin. This accretionary margin, on {{the east}} coast of New Zealand, is related to the subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Australian Plate. Several cold vent locations as well as an extensive BSR, indicating the presence of gas hydrates, have been found at this margin. The aims of the ROV-work were to precisely localise active methane vents, to conduct detailed visual observations of the <b>vent</b> <b>structures</b> and activity, and to perform measurements of physical properties and collect samples at and around the vent locations. The three investigated areas generally have a flat to moderate undulating sea floor with soft sediments alternating with carbonate platforms. The different sites were sometimes covered with dense fields of live clams or shell debris, often in association with tube worms, sponges and/or soft tissue corals. Active bubble-releasing seeps were observed at Faures site and LM- 3 site. Bubble-releasing activity was very variable in time, with periods of almost non-activity alternating with periods of violent outbursts. Bubble release occurred mainly from prominent depressions in soft-sediment sea floor. Bottom-water sampling revealed sometimes high concentrations of methane. Sediment-temperature measurements were largely comparable with the bottom-water temperature except for a raindrop site (with dense populations of polychaetes), where anomalous low sediment-temperature was measured. Further analysis of the ROV data together with the integration of other datasets will enable us to produce a model characterising seep structure and environment...|$|R
50|$|The volcano was {{constructed}} within four different phases. The first phase (possibly 2.5Ma) {{occurred in the}} main crater and subsidiary vents and was basaltic andesite in composition. It crops out in deep gorges. The second phase (0.97-0.89 Ma, by K-Ar) involved the main <b>vent,</b> subsidiary <b>structures</b> and was basaltic and andesitic in composition with ignimbrites and pyroclastics, with tuffs and lava flows emanating from satellite centres. It was the most voluminous and included the Shamiram and Egvard subsidiary centres. The third phase (0.74-0.68 Ma) while similar to the second was more restricted in regional extent to the Mantash River basin. The fourth stage (0.56-0.45 Ma) involved mafic lava flows from parasitic vents in the southern parts of the volcano.|$|R
40|$|A mound-shaped authigenic {{carbonate}} buildup (50 m {{wide and}} 5 m high) {{occurred in the}} middle part of the Late Miocene shallow marine succession (the Hunghuatzu Formation) exposed along the Nantzuhsien River, SW Taiwan. The carbonate concretions are classified into four types based on morphology, which appeared to develop in upward sequence with vague boundaries: (1) flat-pipe shaped nodules: highly dolomitic small pipes or nodules subparallel to the host strata, (2) bulb-shaped nodules: discrete or combined small mesoclots with subspherical to irregular shapes, (3) mushroom-shaped concretions: large mushroom-like or irregular shaped blocks with chimney or <b>vent</b> <b>structures,</b> and (4) carbonated layers with sedimentary structures. These concretions {{are mainly composed of}} dolomite micrites, quartz, feldspar, muscovite, and clay minerals, ubiquitously interweaved with blackish brown colored low magnesium calcite (LMC) veins. Low (delta C- 13 (VPDB) values (- 51. 8 parts per thousand to - 29. 8 parts per thousand) of all types of the carbonates reveal that the carbonates were mainly derived from anaerobic oxidation of hydrocarbons. Many samples are also O- 18 -depleted (delta O- 18 (VPDB) : - 11. 5 parts per thousand to 1. 00 parts per thousand) due to the mixture with isotopically light LMC veins, likely precipitated from meteoric waters. There are numerous chemosymbiotic bivalve fossils (genus Monitilora? diameter 3 - 4 cm) in growth position just above the carbonate buildup. According to the geological and isotopic signatures, the Hunghuatzu carbonates are related to a cold seep pseudobioherm, which formed in a very shallow marine environment like tidal-flat in a passive margin setting. Exposures of the Hunghuatzu pseudobioherm may provide clues for tracking and comparing the evolution history of gas reservoir systems and hints of active tectonics of the SW Taiwan region.

40|$|Chemiosmotic {{coupling}} is universal: {{practically all}} cells harness electrochemical proton gradients across membranes to drive ATP synthesis, powering biochemistry. Autotrophic cells, including phototrophs and chemolithotrophs, also use proton gradients to power carbon fixation directly. The universality of chemiosmotic coupling {{suggests that it}} arose very early in evolution, but its origins are obscure. Alkaline hydrothermal systems sustain natural proton gradients across the thin inorganic barriers of interconnected micropores within deep-sea vents. In Hadean oceans, these inorganic barriers should have contained catalytic Fe(Ni) S minerals similar in structure to cofactors in modern metabolic enzymes, suggesting a possible abiotic origin of chemiosmotic coupling. The continuous supply of H 2 and CO 2 from vent fluids and early oceans, respectively, offers further parallels with the biochemistry of ancient autotrophic cells, notably the acetyl CoA pathway in archaea and bacteria. However, the precise mechanisms by which natural proton gradients, H 2, CO 2 and metal sulphides could have driven organic synthesis are uncertain, and theoretical ideas lack empirical support. We have built a simple electrochemical reactor to simulate conditions in alkaline hydrothermal vents, allowing investigation {{of the possibility that}} abiotic vent chemistry could prefigure the origins of biochemistry. We discuss the construction and testing of the reactor, describing the precipitation of thin-walled, inorganic structures containing nickel-doped mackinawite, a catalytic Fe(Ni) S mineral, under prebiotic ocean conditions. These simulated <b>vent</b> <b>structures</b> appear to generate low yields of simple organics. Synthetic microporous matrices can concentrate organics by thermophoresis over several orders of magnitude under continuous open-flow vent conditions.

40|$|This paper applies {{nonlinear}} Bayesian inversion to marine controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) {{data collected}} near two {{sites of the}} Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 311 on the northern Cascadia Margin to investigate subseafloor resistivity structure related to gas hydrate deposits and cold vents. The Cascadia margin, off {{the west coast of}} Vancouver Island, Canada, has a large accretionary prism where sediments are under pressure due to convergent plate boundary tectonics. Gas hydrate deposits and cold <b>vent</b> <b>structures</b> have previously been investigated by various geophysical methods and seabed drilling. Here, we invert time-domain CSEM data collected at Sites U 1328 and U 1329 of IODP Expedition 311 using Bayesian methods to derive subsurface resistivity model parameters and uncertainties. The Bayesian information criterion is applied to determine the amount of structure (number of layers in a depth-dependent model) that can be resolved by the data. The parameter space is sampled with the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm in principal-component space, utilizing parallel tempering to ensure wider and efficient sampling and convergence. Nonlinear inversion allows analysis of uncertain acquisition parameters such as time delays between receiver and transmitter clocks as well as input electrical current amplitude. Marginalizing over these instrument parameters in the inversion accounts for their contribution to the geophysical model uncertainties. One-dimensional inversion of time-domain CSEM data collected at measurement sites along a survey line allows interpretation of the subsurface resistivity structure. The data sets can be generally explained by models with 1 to 3 layers. Inversion results at U 1329, at the landward edge of the gas hydrate stability zone, indicate a sediment unconformity as well as potential cold vents which were previously unknown. The resistivities generally increase upslope due to sediment erosion along the slope. Inversion results at U 1328 on the middle slope suggest several vent systems close to Bullseye vent in agreement with ongoing interdisciplinary observations...|$|R
40|$|Three {{distinct}} and intersecting sets of graben exist near the Martian volcano Alba Patera. One set {{formed as a}} response to the evolution of the Alba Patera edifice. A second set includes mainly linear structures widely interpreted to have formed in response to very large-scale regional stresses. The members of the third set contain numerous pit craters, and we propose that these craters formed as a result of volcanic activity above long regional dikes emanating from a source to the south within the Tharsis region. The pit craters are of two morphologies: small (< 2 km), regular-shaped ones, usually completely contained within a graben but occasionally unbounded, and larger (4 – 10 km), irregular ones which commonly coalesce with one another. We argue that these two types of crater formed by different but related mechanisms. The smaller ones developed as the magma in a stalled dike degassed and volatiles were lost to the atmosphere via cracks and fractures in the overlying crustal rocks, which then collapsed into the potential void space at the top of the dike, producing the pit craters. The larger craters formed subsequent to short-lived explosive eruptions sourced from the underlying dike when the dike walls imploded and collapsed, destroying evidence of any <b>vent</b> <b>structures.</b> There are no visible products of these eruptions because the ambient Martian atmospheric conditions caused the explosive eruptions to be very vigorous, dispersing the products over very wide areas. Evidence indicates that both formation mechanisms occurred within very short distances over the same dike. Preexisting local tectonic stresses appear to have influenced the locations of the pit craters, and groundwater may have been involved in determining their locations and the style of eruptive activity...|$|R
