500|$|Alex Borstein {{was cast}} as Lois Griffin, Tricia Takanawa, Loretta Brown, and Lois' mother Barbara Pewterschmidt. Borstein {{was asked to}} provide a voice for the {{original}} pilot while {{she was working on}} MADtv. She had not met MacFarlane or seen any of his artwork and said it was [...] "really sight unseen". At the time, Borstein performed in a stage show in Los Angeles, in which she played a redheaded mother whose voice she had based on one of her cousins. The voice was originally slower, but when MacFarlane heard it, he replied [...] "Make it a little less [...] annoying...and speed it up, or every episode will last four hours". Seth Green was chosen to play Chris Griffin and Neil Goldman. Green stated that he did an impression of the [...] "Buffalo Bill" [...] character from the thriller film The Silence of the Lambs during his audition. His main inspiration for Chris' <b>voice</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> envisioning how [...] "Buffalo Bill" [...] would sound if he were speaking through a public address system at a McDonald's. Lacey Chabert was cast as Meg Griffin. Chabert voiced Meg Griffin for the first production season (15 episodes), but due to a contractual agreement was never credited. Chabert left the series because of time conflicts with schoolwork and her role on Party of Five, and was replaced by Mila Kunis.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Isaac {{taught that}} when a king administers an oath to his legions, he does so with a sword, {{implying}} that whoever transgressed the oath would have the sword pass over his neck. Similarly, at Sinai, as [...] reports, [...] "Moses took half of the blood" [...] (thus adjuring them with the blood). The Midrash asked how Moses knew how much was half of the blood. Rabbi Judah bar Ila'i taught that the blood divided itself into halves on its own. Rabbi Nathan said that its appearance changed; half of it turned black, and half remained red. Bar Kappara told that an angel in the likeness of Moses came down and divided it. Rabbi Isaac taught that a Heavenly <b>Voice</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> Mount Horeb, saying that this much is half of the blood. Rabbi Ishmael taught in a Baraita that Moses was expert in the regulations relating to blood, and by means of that knowledge divided it. [...] goes on to say, [...] "And {{he put it in}} basins ( [...] , aganot)." [...] Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Avin that [...] writes the word in a form that might be read aganat ("basin," [...] singular) indicating that neither basin was larger than the other. Moses asked God what to do with God's portion. God told Moses to sprinkle it on the people. ( [...] reports, [...] "And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people.") Moses asked what he should do with the Israelites' portion. God said to sprinkle it on the altar, as [...] says, [...] "And half of the blood he dashed against the altar." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology, based on Mikhail M. Bakhtin's {{approach to the}} study of narrative, as a tool to analyze the processes of cultural change in minority groups. In particular, we analyze the multiple voices that are present in the statements of members of Roma communities when they talk about and express their culture. Roma communities are displayed in a process of profound cultural shift and where different voices have a dialog, some <b>voices</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> cultural tradition, other <b>voices</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> models of the dominant social group, and other <b>voices</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the attempt to compromise between them. This multivoicedness is the playing field between minority and majority groups, movements of dialogue happen, assimilations, resistances, creating new cultural differences and hybridization. So, a scene is developed in a constant process of change in which daily practices often must respond to different and even contradictory goals, and in which different voices are intertwined in the process of constructing new identities. </p...|$|R
