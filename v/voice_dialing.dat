40|$|Abstractâ€”Speaker {{recognition}} {{is the process}} of automatically recognising the speaker on the basis of individual information included in speech waves. The objective of automatic speaker {{recognition is}} to extract, characterize and recognize the information about speaker identity. Speaker recognition technology can be used in many services such as <b>voice</b> <b>dialling,</b> banking by telephone, telephone shopping, database access services, information services, voice mail, security control for confidential information areas, and remote access to computers. Feature extraction is an important process in speaker recognition. In this paper Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients method is used in order to design a text dependent speaker recognition system. Different types of windowing methods are used during feature extraction. In this paper, a comparative analysis of different windowing techniques is done {{in order to determine the}} most effective windowing technique for MFCC speaker recognition...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in {{automatic speech recognition}} (ASR) technology have enabled us to develop the first commercially available <b>voice</b> name <b>dialing</b> service that provides the user with voice control of all aspects of service operation, including training the ASR device, administering the dialing list, and plac-ing calls to listed parties by saying their name. One of the principal challenges in designing the service has involved anticipating the sources of breakdowns, occasions in which the user is compelled to attend to an ASR capability that has failed to respond as expected. Iterative design-and-test studies have pro-duced a service judged fun {{and easy to use}} in recent commercial trials. This paper describes the studies and the design details that have enabled us to avoid or accommodate a variety of potential breakdowns, and so realize the new potential of ASR in telecommunication applications such as <b>voice</b> name <b>dialing...</b>|$|R

40|$|Despite big {{technological}} advancements, we {{are still}} bound to use keyboard and mouse as default computer peripheral. When using mobile devices, the scope of possible interactions with a device quickly grows. Many mobile device users would like to use voice commands for both simple (<b>voice</b> <b>dial),</b> {{as well as for}} demanding tasks such as web search. Usually, it takes a number of learning examples on which speech recognizer learns and improves. In this thesis, we are trying to avoid this necessity. The main goal of this thesis is the development of a mobile application that recognizes speech without a demand for a substantial number of learning examples and which will operate completely independently, without active internet connection. The method used for speech recognition system in this thesis is well-known Dynamic Time Warping method. Analysis, where we compared accuracy and speed of recognition, was carried out. Based on the results of the analysis we have successfully proposed a few steps to optimize the speed of our speech recognition application and preserve its accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Speech and signal {{processing}} technologies need new methods {{that deal with}} the problems of noise and adaptation in order for these technologies to become common tools for communication and information processing. This chapter is concerned with a method and a system for adaptive speech recognition in a noisy environment (ASN). A system based on the described method can store words and phrases spo-ken by the user and subsequently recognise them when they are pronounced as con-nected words in a noisy environment. The method guarantees system robustness in respect to noise, regardless of its origin and level. New words, pronunciations, and languages can be introduced to the system in an incremental, adaptive mode. The method and system are based on novel techniques recently created by the authors, namely: adaptive noise suppression, and evolving connectionist systems. Potential applications are numerous, e. g. <b>voice</b> <b>dialling</b> in a noisy environment, voice com-mand control, improved wireless communications, data entry into databases, helping disabled people, multimedia systems, improved human computer interaction. The method and system are illustrated on the recognition of English spoken digits in dif-ferent noisy environments...|$|R
50|$|Bubbly is {{a social}} voice service working across feature phones and smartphones. For feature phones, users can record their <b>voice</b> by <b>{{dialling}}</b> a short code and speaking, as well as listen to popular posts. Subscribers get a text with the short code number for dialling into Bubblyâ€™s servers to have the voice message play back. To cater to smartphone users, Bubbly was made available on iOS and Android platforms in April 2012.|$|R
