With a phylogeny and an improved capacity {{to account for}} the effects of size, we have reanalysed our morphometric data for male Australian goannas (<b>Varanus</b> <b>spp.)</b> using an increased number of specimens and species to examinewhether variations in body shape canbe accounted for by retreat choice, as it can for Western Australian Ctenophorus dragon lizards. After accounting for body size in the current analysis, four ecotypes basedon retreat choice (i. e. those that retreat toobliquecrevicesbetween large rocksor rock faces, those that retreat toburrows dug into the ground, those that retreat to spaces under rocks or in tree hollows, and those that retreat to trees but not tree hollows) accounted formuchof thevariation inbody shape. There is aphylogenetic pattern to theecotypes, but accounting for phylogenetic effects did notweaken the link betweenbody shape and ecotypebasedon retreat choice. This suggests that there are large differences in body shape among ecotypes, and shape is relatively independent of phylogeny. The strong link between shape and choice of retreat site in <b>Varanus</b> <b>spp.</b> is consistent with that for Ctenophorus spp. We speculate on why there might be a strong link between retreat choice and body shape for both Varanus and Ctenophorus...|$|E

40|$|Escherichia coli {{isolates}} play a {{major role}} in the horizontal gene transfer of resistance genes located on mobile genetic elements between intestinal bacteria of different species and genera. 1 While data on antimicrobial resistance in E. coli are commonly obtained from clinical isolates of humans, food-producing animals or pets, little is known about the antimicro-bial resistance of E. coli from free-living animals in remote geographical areas. In this study, we investigated 28 E. coli isolates obtained from faecal samples of monitor lizards (<b>Varanus</b> <b>spp.)</b> for the presence of antimicrobial resistance-mediating gene cassettes located in class 1 integrons. The 28 E. coli isolates were obtained from free-living indi-vidual animals of different monitor lizard species captured alive in various regions in Indonesia. Antimicrobial resist-ance testing by disc diffusion was performed and evaluate...|$|E
40|$|Learning in {{reptiles}} {{has been}} studied {{with a variety of}} methods and included numerous species. However, research on learning in lizards has generally focused on spatial memory and has used only a few species. No research has specifically investigated and documented the use of visual discrimination in monitor lizards. The ability of monitor lizards (<b>Varanus</b> <b>spp.)</b> to discriminate between visual stimuli was investigated. Subjects were tested on acquisition and two reversals of a discrimination task between black and white stimuli. A food-choice procedure was used to determine if consistent rankings of food items could be determined using a multiple-stimulus choice procedure. The functional value of the rankings was assessed using a progressive ratio technique. The subjects formed stable food preferences, which were reflected in increased response requirement completed for preferred items and subjects did successfully learn the initial discrimination task and the following reversals.

40|$|Abstract. Reported {{cases of}} herpesvirus-induced disease are {{uncommon}} in most species of reptiles, {{with the majority}} of reports in chelonians. Two monitor lizards (<b>Varanus</b> <b>spp.)</b> presented for postmortem examination at the Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Missouri. Tan, 1 – 2 -mm foci were grossly visible on the mucosal surface of the intestine and in the liver. Microscopically, there was multifocal necrosis in the lamina propria of the small intestine and in the liver. Many of the degenerate cells contained large, eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions. Enveloped icosahedral virions consistent with herpesvirus were detected by electron microscopy. A 180 -bp DNA fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from samples of small intestine and liver using primers that targeted a portion of the herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene. The sequence of the fragment was determined to be most closely related to Varanid herpesvirus 2 (80 % nucleotide identity, 82 % amino acid identity). Based on histological and molecular findings, a novel pathogenic herpesvirus of lizards in the family Varanidae is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Es wurden Trichomonaden von folgenden verschiedenen Vogelarten untersucht: Taube (Columba livia f. domestica; Columba livia f. urbana; Streptopelia decaocto; Columba palumbus), Kanarienvogel (Serinus canaria), Wellensittich (Melopsittacus undulatus), Greifvogel (Habichtsadler, Hieraaetus fasciatus; Wanderfalke, Falco peregrinus; Rötelfalke, Falko naumanni; Zwergadler, Hieraaetus pennatus; Schleiereule, Tyto alba; Rohrweihe, Circus aeruginosus; Mäusebussard, Buteo buteo; Uhu, Bubo bubo), Huhn (Gallus gallus), Ente (Anas platyrhynchos f. domestica), Pute (Meleagris gallopavo) und Ringfasan (Phasia¬nus colchicus). Zu Vergleichszwecken wurden auch Trichomonaden vom Rind (Bos taurus) und Flagellaten vom Waran (<b>Varanus</b> <b>spp.)</b> untersucht. Hierzu dienten Abstriche vom Pharynx bzw. vom Darm sowie fixierte und gefärbte Präparate. Die Trichomonaden wurden auf verschiedenen Medien (Diamond-Medium, HEF- und HELZ-Kulturen) angezüchtet, gefärbt und lichtmikroskopisch ihre Morphologie verglichen. Aus diesen Untersuchungen wurde geschlossen, dass eine rein morphologische Unterscheidung sehr unsicher ist. Die DNAs von 121 verschiedenen Trichomonadenisolaten, isoliert aus den oben {{genannten}} Vogelarten, wurden präpariert und die 5, 8 S rRNA-Regionen mittels PCR amplifiziert. Eine Typisierung durch RAPD-PCR oder Pulsfeldgelelektrophorese war nicht möglich. Für vergleichende genotypische Studien wurden erstmals Restriktionsenzym¬analysen mit den Enzymen BseLI, MseI, TaqI, TasI und VspI durchgeführt. Mit Hilfe der Enzyme BseLI, MseI und TasI ist eine Unterscheidung zwischen aviären Trichomonas sp. und aviären Tetratrichomonas sp. möglich. Die Enzyme TaqI und VspI zeigen Unterschiede innerhalb von aviären Trichomonas sp. und aviären Tetratrichomonas sp. Hier unterscheiden sich Trichomonaden der verschiedenen Vogelarten und zum Teil auch innerhalb einer Vogelart. The trichomonads of {{the following}} different species of birds have been investigated: pigeon (Columba livia f. domestica; Columba livia f. urbana; Streptopelia decaocto; Columba palumbus), canary (Serinus canaria), budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus), bird of prey (Bonellis eagle, Hieraaetus fasciatus; peregrine falcon, Falco peregrinus; lesser kestrel, Falko naumanni; booted eagle, Hieraaetus pennatus; barn-owl, Tyto alba; marsh harrier, Circus aeruginosus; buzzard, Buteo buteo; eagle owl, Bubo bubo), fowl (Gallus gallus), duck (Anas platyrhynchos f. domestica), turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and pheasant (Phasianus colchicus). For reason of comparison the trichomonads of cattle (Bos taurus) and of monitor lizard (<b>Varanus</b> <b>spp.)</b> have been investigated, too. For this purpose swabs of the pharynx respectively the intestine as well as fixed and stained microscopic preparations have been used. The trichomonads were cultivated in different media (Diamondmedium, CEF- and CELC-cultures), they were stained and their morphology was compared microscopically. The conclusion from these investigations is that a morphological distinction is rather uncertain. The DNA of 121 different Trichomonasisolates from the birds mentioned above were prepared and the 5, 8 S rRNA-regions were amplified by PCR. A typing with RAPD-PCR or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was not possible. For comparative genotypical studies, restriction enzyme analyses were carried {{out for the first}} time with the enzymes BseLI, MseI, TaqI, TasI and VspI. A distinction between avian Trichomonas sp. and avian Tetratrichomonas sp. is possible with the enzymes BseLI, MseI and TasI. The enzymes TaqI and VspI show variations within avian Trichomonas sp. and avian Tetratrichomonas sp [...] Here a distinction can be made between the trichomonads of different species of birds and in some cases within one species of birds...|$|E
40|$|In Australia, {{the olive}} ridley sea turtle Lepidochelys olivacea has {{received}} little research attention and monitoring. The Australian populations {{are relatively small}} and their distribution is limited to remote areas {{in the northern part of}} the country. Previous global genetic studies of olive ridley populations showed that the Australian breeding population at the McCluer Group of islands, Northern Territory, is genetically distinct from other olive ridley populations breeding in the Indo-Pacific. However, nothing is known about the genetic stock structure among Australian olive ridley rookeries found across northern Australia. High predation of eggs by feral pigs, dogs and monitor lizards <b>Varanus</b> <b>spp.</b> is believed to have severely impacted the number of nesting females at some rookeries. Of particular concern is the small nesting population on the western Cape York Peninsula, and without immediate conservation action this population could face extinction. The results presented here establish that there are at least 2 independent management units (stocks) of olive ridley turtles nesting in Australia and emphasise the importance of conserving the genetically distinct small breeding population nesting along the western Cape York Peninsula. In addition, results from 44 turtles caught in ghost nets across the Gulf of Carpentaria revealed that 45 % of the haplotypes (32 % of all ghost net samples) had not been observed at any rookery in Australia or SE Asia. This research highlights the need for better information on olive ridley population structure in the region and for urgent conservation action for the western Cape York population...|$|E
40|$|Excessive {{sea turtle}} nest {{predation}} {{is a problem}} for conservation management of sea turtle populations. This study assessed predation on nests of the endangered loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) at Wreck Rock beach adjacent to Deepwater National Park in Southeast Queensland, Australia after a control program for feral foxes was instigated. The presence of predators on the nesting dune was evaluated by tracking plots (2 ×  1 m) every 100 m along the dune front. There were 21 (2014 – 2015) and 41 (2015 – 2016) plots established along the dune, and these were monitored for predator tracks daily over three consecutive months in both nesting seasons. Predator activities at nests were also recorded by the presence of tracks on top of nests until hatchlings emerged. In addition, camera traps were set to record the predator activity around selected nests. The tracks of the fox (Vulpes vulpes) and goanna (<b>Varanus</b> <b>spp)</b> were found on tracking plots. Tracking plots, nest tracks and camera traps indicated goanna abundance varied strongly between years. Goannas were widely distributed along the beach and had a Passive Activity Index (PAI) (0. 31 in 2014 – 2015 and 0. 16 in 2015 – 2016) approximately seven times higher than that of foxes (PAI 0. 04 in 2014 – 2015 and 0. 02 in 2015 – 2016). Five hundred and twenty goanna nest visitation events were recorded by tracks but no fox tracks were found at turtle nests. Camera trap data indicated that yellow-spotted goannas (Varanus panoptes) appeared at loggerhead turtle nests more frequently than lace monitors (V.  varius) did, and further that lace monitors only predated nests previously opened by yellow-spotted goannas. No foxes were recorded at nests with camera traps. This study suggests that large male yellow-spotted goannas are the major predator of sea turtle nests at the Wreck Rock beach nesting aggregation and that goanna activity varies between years...|$|E
