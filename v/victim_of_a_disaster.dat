We show that the individualized treatments favor the provision of the collective good through voluntary cooperation whereas the uniform treatments encourage free-riding.

30|$|The {{number of}} natural and {{man-made}} disasters has been increasing {{in recent years and}} these disasters have affected many people. To prevent the loss of lives and help the <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster,</b> response times must be minimized. Disaster operations management can be divided into four phases: mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery [1]. In the mitigation phase, <b>a</b> risk analysis <b>of</b> the settlements and public education is performed. Resource planning and the advance purchase of supplies is carried out in the preparedness phase. The response phase includes activities related to needs assessment, resource mobilization and the transportation of relief aids. Finally, the recovery phase entails the removal of all debris and rebuilding essential infrastructure. After the onset of any disaster, the current situation is assessed, and then resources are mobilized for transport to the disaster area. If required, relief aid is also procured and transportation operations are managed. Logistics operations are important in the humanitarian relief chain and account for around 80 % of all disaster relief activities [2].|$|R
40|$|Many {{witnesses}} attest that <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> often perish {{because they}} `freeze' {{in the face}} of danger. It has been proposed that this cognitive paralysis occurs due to temporal and cognitive constraints on survival response times while leaving open the question of which cognitive component is implicated in this behavior. This paper proposes, firstly, that the temporal constraints which occur during an emergency inhibit the functioning of the supervisory attentional system (SAS), which leads to the victim showing: 1) an appropriate response, if trained; 2) stereotypical or otherwise irrational behavior, if untrained; or 3) cognitive paralysis. Secondly, that the main role of the SAS is to operate as a temporal buffer, enabling a survival response to be prepared prior to facing a life-threatening event and not as a real-time immediate responder. It is argued that the initial cognitive paralysis differs at the cognitive and neurological levels from the more prolonged hypoactive behavior commonly seen in victims rescued from disasters and which is considered to be <b>a</b> form <b>of</b> disassociative reaction...|$|R

This thesis centers on the question: To what extent should the military be involved in domestic humanitarian assistance and disaster relief? Analysis of mistakes from Katrina point to the answer: The U.

This paper develops a new two-stage stochastic network flow model to help decide how to rapidly supply humanitarian aid to <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> within this context. The model takes into account practical characteristics that have been neglected by the literature so far, such as budget allocation, fleet sizing of multiple types of vehicles, procurement, and varying lead times over a dynamic multiperiod horizon.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study and explore the importance of hospitals in natural disaster events and to identify the impacts on the hospitals in natural <b>disaster</b> events. <b>A</b> <b>disaster</b> is <b>an</b> unforeseen event, which can overwhelm the capacity of the affected people to manage its impact. Many people are periodically exposed to natural disasters in their life, and most disasters, or more correctly hazards that lead to disasters, cannot be prevented. However, their effects can be mitigated. Disaster management efforts aim to reduce or avoid the potential losses from hazards, assure prompt and appropriate assistance to the <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster,</b> and achieve <b>a</b> rapid and effective recovery. It is crucial that hospitals remain safe and functional during and after disasters. Health facilities at all levels deserve special attention in the case of natural disasters as they must continue the work of current patient treatment within their facilities and provide additional care for persons injured by the disaster event. Disaster management becomes even more important for hospitals as the health sector has been particularly vulnerable to the damage caused. For this study, secondary information was retrieved from the Internet on sudden-onset natural disasters {{in different parts of the}} world was collected.

During the first week after Morakot’s struck, most engineers concerned the immeasurable injury to infrastructures but wondered how to contribute their proficient. Before the official agencies started to investigate the overall loss of the event, the China Engineering Consultants, Inc. (CECI) organized human resources from universities and societies of professional engineers forming 6 reconnaissance teams to investigate all the reported damaged bridges within 14 days (August 21 st to September 2 nd). Since a complete evidence recording is necessary to evaluate and to diagnose the cause of bridge damage, several important bridges were examined and recorded by advanced equipment before any rehabilitation commencing. This part of work was helped by special technical companies. Three months later, a reconnaissance report was printed to reveal the inclusive bridge loss in the event. There were 114 bridges entirely destroyed or partially damaged from the mountain area to plain field by debris flow and flood. Detailed causes-to-damage investigations were conducted on some collapsed bridges by nondestructive methods, including unmanned micro aerial vehicle (UMAV), 3 D Laser scanner, underwater sonar, underwater ground penetration radar (GPR), and electric resistivity image (ERI).
