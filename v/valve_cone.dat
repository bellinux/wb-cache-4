40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{research}} about {{the performance of}} diesel helical intake port, the method of steady flow test and CFD numerical simulation was combined to do structure study. By the steady flow test, the parameters of boundary condition for simulation calculation were provided, such as the flow coefficient and swirl ratio. Based on the experiment results, CFD simulation was calculated on the three-dimensional models of intake port with the modification of center distance, valve chamber height and the <b>valve</b> <b>cone</b> angle. And the results basically analyze that the flow characteristic of intake port was affected by above three parameters. This research shows the direction of detailed design of intake port and further experiment, which can shorten development time and costs of intake port...|$|E
40|$|Cavitation in <b>cone</b> <b>valves</b> {{can cause}} {{eventual}} valve failure. However, little {{data are available}} on cavitation limits for solid plug <b>cone</b> <b>valves.</b> Flow conditions were identified for a 6 inch <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> where incipient, critical, incipient damage, and choking cavitation limits occurred at valve openings between 20 and 70 degrees. A description of how these limits are used to predict cavitation intensity is given. Air was used to reduce the damage levels. Aeration increased the allowable pressure drop for damage free operation 6 to 72 percent for valve openings less than 70 degrees. A chart is given for predicting when a <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> will draw air. Location of the air injection point 1 s not important {{as long as it}} is introduced into the separation zone...|$|R

25|$|Fixed <b>cone</b> <b>valves</b> are {{designed}} to dissipate the energy from a water flow during reservoir discharge. They are a round pipe section with an adjustable sleeve gate and cone at the discharge end. Flow is varied by moving the sleeve away or towards its cone seat. The design allows high pressure water {{from the base of}} a dam to be released without causing erosion to the surrounding environment. Fixed <b>cone</b> <b>valves</b> are able to handle heads up to 300 m.|$|R

40|$|The thesis aims to {{determine}} the influence partial or complete submerge of hollow <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> by outflow on its capacity without space restrictions, by outflow into discharge chamber and by outflow into water tunnel of circular cross section. The valve capacity is for mutual comparability purposes usually characterized by discharge coefficient. Research works have been performed on a spatial hydraulic model of the valve with inlet diameter D = 67 mm and an apex angle of a cone 90 °. Values of the discharge coefficient obtained from measurements were statistically analyzed. The dependence of discharge coefficient, expressed by energy head, on submerged level was approximated by an exponential function. Exponent value of this function express the dependance rate of valve capacity on downstream water level. This procedure didn’t demonstrate signifiant dependance downstream water level on hollow <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> capacity, only on tests at outflow to water tunel showed a low increase in the discharge coefficient {{partly due to the}} influence of kinetic energy of the stream flowing out of the tunnel on the energy head and also due to underpressure. Independence of discharge coefficient value on valve head has been prooved for head greather than 232 mm. Also was defined 3 stages of interaction outflow jet from valve and downstream water, some of them may cause on real waterworks structures unfavorable situations (may affect excessive load on valve by pressure pulsations). The presented results allow better evaluation of bottom outlets capacity at higher water levels, when the valves are flooded. Significant effect of sufficient aeration (especially in long water tunnels) on valve capacity was also confirmed. Taking into account on the specifics of hollow jet <b>valves</b> and <b>cone</b> <b>valves,</b> it is possible to generalize some of this resultos on them as well...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Stop valves are {{commonly}} used as fluid flow control equipments in many engineering applications. A numerical study of a three-dimensional, complex geometry, stop-check valve was performed for model validation and improved understanding of valve flow features. This paper has provided a numerical investigation of the fluid flow inside a stop valve, including the modeling and the simulation of the stop valves. According to the simulation result of original <b>valve</b> structure, two <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> block shape with different gradient are presented to bring some optimization to the stop-valve. CFD simulations were conducted for different structure of the valve to verify {{the performance of the}} valve after redesign the internal flow structure. The simulation results show that the pressure drop vortex strength, maximum velocity and velocity nonuniformity of valve outlet had been reduced obviously. Furthermore, the results of the three-dimensional optimization analysis of valve shape can be used in the design of low noise and high efficiency valve for industry...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cone</b> <b>valves</b> or {{ball valves}} are another alternative. These are {{commonly}} found as the service shut-off valves in more-expensive water systems and usually found in gas taps (and, incidentally, the cask beer taps referred to above). They {{can be identified}} by their range of motion—only 90°—between fully open and closed. Usually, when the handle {{is in line with}} the pipe the valve is open, and when the handle is across the pipe it is closed. A <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> consists of a shallowly tapering cone in a tight-fitting socket placed across the flow of the fluid. In UK English this is usually known as a taper-plug cock. A ball valve uses a spherical ball instead. In either case, a hole through the cone or ball allows the fluid to pass if it is lined up with the openings in the socket through which the fluid enters and leaves; turning the cone using the handle rotates the passage away, presenting the fluid with the unbroken surface of the cone through which it cannot pass. Valves of this type using a cylinder rather than a cone are sometimes encountered, but using a cone allows a tight fit to be made even with moderate manufacturing tolerances. The ball in ball valves rotates within plastic seats.|$|R

The flow fields of the two kinds of Fixed-Cone Valves were studied by using numerical simulation method. The computed pressure fields and the velocity fields were analyzed,which shows that under the same conditions,and by using the nested Fixed-Cone valve, the pressure of the upstream pipe and the <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> and the average velocity along the downstream pipeline are reduced,but the rate of energy dissipation is increased...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} dealing with the design and {{position}} of the discharge chamber of hollow <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> and is based on model research. The research response especially to the existing bottom outlets, where the position of valve is changed as opposed to the current position. The change of the valve position causes construction interventions minimization and also required financial resources are minimized. The other case is to interchange the old <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> and the new one. This action is supporting the idea of valve spare parts unfication. In the research has been defined the automodeling area of outlet jet diversion from valve axis for different remoteness between water surface level and valve. The outflow jet diversion angle from valve axis has been measured in relation with relative valve opening. The coefficient of outflow has been specified in relation with relative valve opening. Furthermore, it has been searched for the position of discharge plane, where the discharging is done without backsplash. The last part of model tests was the discharge effect evaluation of most used chamber shapes. In the final chapter has been recomended the optimal shape and position of discharge chamber in dimensionless units, relative to the inlet diameter of the valve, all this based on results of model research. These results will enable reliable and efficient design of additional adjustments of discharge chamber shapes...|$|R

5000|$|Alcan {{failed to}} live up to its side of the 1987 {{settlement}} agreement. There were delays in construction of the cold water valve. At first the water in the reservoir was too cold and contained too much nitrogen, while not enough oxygen. in order to create the correct balance, Alcan needed to draw water from both the centre and the surface of the reservoir, then run the water through [...] "a hallow <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> and over a baffle-clock spillway to reduce the amount of nitrogen". Second delays in the construction were due to a decrease in the demand of aluminum and a decrease in the economy. By 1992 the cold water release valve had yet to be built.|$|R

50|$|Johannes Klais studied organ {{building}} in Alsace, Switzerland and Southern Germany. He founded his own {{organ building}} workshop in Bonn in 1882. His way of building organs was closely {{bound up with}} traditional construction methods using slider windchests. But as early as {{before the turn of}} the century he built high pressure stops with two mouths on pneumatic <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> chests. In 1906, together with his son Hans, he introduced electric action. Hans Klais took over in 1925. In his time facade design began to come under the influence of the modern age, ergonomic console designs were also being developed. Hans Gerd Klais, the founder's grandson, took charge in 1965. Philipp Klais, the great-grandson of the founder, studied organ building in Alsace, France; in Germany; and overseas. He now runs the company.|$|R
40|$|As a {{localized}} {{cooling device}} the vortex tube {{is being used}} is several applications due to its simplicity, robustness and maintenance free service. Its design still depends on experiment based empirical relations and thumb rules. Capturing complete flow and energy separation features of vortex tube through experimentation is difficult due to the complexity associated to flow Numerical investigation of the vortex tube presented here intends to bring out unexplored features. The work is done on a 3 D model of vortex tube with 6 nozzles and an adjustable <b>cone</b> <b>valve.</b> The parameters varied in the investigation are supply air pressure from 2 to 6 bars, the orifice diameter from 5 to 10 mm, L/D ratio from 4 to 20. The mechanism of flow and energy separation is completely explained based on present work. The impact of important performance parameters such as supply pressure, cold orifice diameter, tube diameter and its length suggest improvement in the present thumb rule for better vortex tube performance. Present work investigates the effect of working environment also where tube is assumed work under constant wall temperature and constant wall heat flux condition. It concludes that cooling performance of the tube is independent of thermal condition imposed on its wall...|$|R
40|$|The {{vortex tube}} or Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube is {{a device that}} enables the {{separation}} of hot and cold air as compressed air flows tangentially into the vortex chamber through inlet nozzles. Separating cold and hot airs by using {{the principles of the}} vortex tube can be applied to industrial applications such as cooling equipment in CNC machines, refrigerators, cooling suits, heating processes, etc. The vortex tube is well-suited for these applications because it is simple, compact, light, quiet, and does not use Freon or other refrigerants (CFCs/HCFCs). It has no moving parts and does not break or wear and therefore requires little maintenance. Thus, this paper presents an overview of the phenomena occurring inside the vortex tube during the temperature/energy separation on both the counter flow and parallel flow types. The paper also reviews the experiments and the calculations presented in previous studies on temperature separation in the vortex tube. The experiment consisted of two important parameters, the first is the geometrical characteristics of the vortex tube (for example, the diameter and length of the hot and cold tubes, the diameter of the cold orifice, shape of the hot (divergent) tube, number of inlet nozzles, shape of the inlet nozzles, and shape of the <b>cone</b> <b>valve.</b> The second is focused on the thermo-physical parameters such as inlet gas pressure, cold mass fraction, moisture of inlet gas, and type of gas (air, oxygen, helium, and methane). For each parameter, the temperature separation mechanism and the flow-field inside the vortex tubes is explored by measuring the pressure, velocity, and temperature fields. The computation review is concentrated on the quantitative, theoretical, analytical, and numerical (finite volume method) aspects of the study. Although many experimental and numerical studies on the vortex tubes have been made, the physical behaviour of the flow is not fully understood due to its complexity and the lack of consistency in the experimental findings. Furthermore, several different hypotheses based on experimental, analytical, and numerical studies have been put forward to describe the thermal separation phenomenon.
