25|$|On March 27, 1963, {{there was}} an {{electrical}} short in a subway car's motor. The driver decided to continue operating the train, despite <b>visible</b> <b>smoke</b> in the affected car, until the train reached Union station. This decision resulted {{in the destruction of}} six subway cars and extensive damage to the tunnel and signal lines west of Union station. Following this incident, safety procedures involving electrical malfunctions and/or fire in subway trains, were revised to improve safety and reduce the likelihood of a similar incident occurring.|$|E
25|$|The People's Republic of China {{is by far}} {{the largest}} {{producer}} of coal in the world, producing over 2.8 billion tons of coal in 2007, or approximately 39.8 percent of all coal produced in the world during that year. For comparison, the second largest producer, the United States, produced more than 1.1 billion tons in 2007. An estimated 5 million people work in China's coal-mining industry. As many as 20,000 miners die in accidents each year. Most Chinese mines are deep underground and do not produce the surface disruption typical of strip mines. Although there is some evidence of reclamation of mined land for use as parks, China does not require extensive reclamation and is creating significant acreages of abandoned mined land, which is unsuitable for agriculture or other human uses, and inhospitable to indigenous wildlife. Chinese underground mines often experience severe surface subsidence (6â€“12 meters), negatively impacting farmland because it no longer drains well. China uses some subsidence areas for aquaculture ponds but has more than they need for that purpose. Reclamation of subsided ground is a significant problem in China. Because most Chinese coal is for domestic consumption, and is burned with little or no air pollution control equipment, it contributes greatly to <b>visible</b> <b>smoke</b> and severe air pollution in industrial areas using coal for fuel. China's total energy uses 67% from coal mines.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2013, in an Australian Parliamentary speech, the {{question}} was asked, [...] "Are ionization smoke alarms defective?" [...] This was further to the Australian Government's scientific testing agency (the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation - CSIRO) data revealing serious performance problems with ionization technology in the early, smoldering stage of fire, a rise in litigation involving ionization smoke alarms, and increasing legislation mandating the installation of photoelectric smoke alarms. [...] The speech cited a May 2013, World Fire Safety Foundation report published in the Australian Volunteer Fire Fighter Association's magazine titled, 'Can Australian and U.S. Smoke Alarm Standards be Trusted?' The speech concluded with a request {{for one of the}} world's largest ionization smoke alarm manufacturers and the CSIRO to disclose the level of <b>visible</b> <b>smoke</b> required to trigger the manufacturers' ionization smoke alarms under CSIRO scientific testing.|$|E

2500|$|The burn {{temperature}} in modern stoves can increase {{to the point}} where secondary and complete combustion of the fuel takes place. A properly fired masonry heater has little or no particulate pollution in the exhaust and does not contribute to the buildup of creosote in the heater flues or the chimney. Some stoves achieve as little as 1 to 4grams per hour. This is roughly 90% less smoke than older stoves, and equates to nearly zero <b>visible</b> <b>smoke</b> from the chimney. This is largely achieved through causing the maximum amount of material to combust, which results in a net efficiency of 60 to 70% as contrasted to less than 30% for an open fireplace. (Net efficiency is the amount of heat energy transferred to the room compared to the amount contained in the wood, minus any amount central heating must work to compensate for airflow problems.) ...|$|E
60|$|London, {{under the}} <b>Visible</b> <b>Smoke</b> Law, by which any {{production}} of <b>visible</b> <b>smoke</b> {{with or without}} excuse was punishable by a fine, had already ceased to be the sombre smoke-darkened city of the Victorian time; it had been, and indeed was, constantly being rebuilt, and its main streets were already beginning to take on those characteristics that distinguished them throughout {{the latter half of}} the twentieth century. The insanitary horse and the plebeian bicycle had been banished from the roadway, which was now of a resilient, glass-like surface, spotlessly clean; and the foot passenger was restricted to a narrow vestige of the ancient footpath on either side of the track and forbidden at the risk of a fine, if he survived, to cross the roadway. People descended from their automobiles upon this pavement and went through the lower shops to the lifts and stairs to the new ways for pedestrians, the Rows, that ran along the front of the houses at the level of the first story, and, being joined by frequent bridges, gave the newer parts of London a curiously Venetian appearance. In some streets there were upper and even third-story Rows. For most of the day and all night the shop windows were lit by electric light, and many establishments had made, as it were, canals of public footpaths through their premises in order to increase their window space.|$|E

Turning towards the door, he now caught sight of us. He was short, cadaverous, and withered, with his head sunk sideways between his shoulders and the breath issuing in <b>visible</b> <b>smoke</b> from his mouth as if he were on fire within.

60|$|All {{through my}} middle Cambridge period, the guns boomed and the rifles {{crackled}} away {{there on the}} veldt, and the horsemen rode and the tale of accidents and blundering went on. Men, mules, horses, stores and money poured into South Africa, and the convalescent wounded streamed home. I see it in my memory as if I had looked at it through a window instead of {{through the pages of}} the illustrated papers; I recall as if I had been there the wide open spaces, the ragged hillsides, the open order attacks of helmeted men in khaki, the scarce <b>visible</b> <b>smoke</b> of the guns, the wrecked trains in great lonely places, the burnt isolated farms, and at last the blockhouses and the fences of barbed wire uncoiling and spreading for endless miles across the desert, netting the elusive enemy until at last, though he broke the meshes again and again, we had him in the toils. If one's attention strayed in the lecture-room it wandered to those battle-fields.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a large}} brick arch (made from fire brick) {{attached}} to the front wall of the firebox immediately beneath the firetubes. This extends backwards over the front third to half of the firebed. It is supported on arch tubes, thermic syphons, or circulators. The brick arch directs heat, flames, and smoke back over the fire towards {{the rear of the}} firebox. <b>Visible</b> <b>smoke</b> contains unburned combustible carbon particles and combustible gasses. The purpose of this redirection is to cause more complete combustion of these particles and gasses which make the locomotive more efficient and causes less <b>visible</b> <b>smoke</b> to be emitted from the stack. Without the arch, flames and <b>visible</b> <b>smoke</b> would be sucked straight into the firetubes without having been fully burned, causing <b>visible</b> <b>smoke</b> to be emitted at the stack. The brick arch and its supports (arch tubes, thermic syphons, and circulators) require periodic replacement due to the extreme heat they endure.|$|E

5000|$|Ammunition for mortars {{generally}} {{comes in}} two main varieties: fin-stabilized and spin-stabilized.

There are also training rounds and precision-guided rounds, such as the Strix mortar round. Mortar bombs are often referred to, incorrectly, as [...] "mortars".|$|R
