5|$|Class {{differences}} were not as great in the <b>Vendée</b> as in Paris or in other French provinces. In the rural <b>Vendée,</b> the local nobility {{seems to have been}} more permanently in residence and less bitterly resented than in other parts of France. Alexis de Tocqueville noted that most French nobles lived in cities by 1789. An Intendants' survey showed one of the few areas where they still lived with the peasants was the <b>Vendée.</b> Consequently, the conflicts that drove the revolution in Paris, for example, were also lessened in this particularly isolated part of France by the strong adherence of the populace to their Catholic faith.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the French Revolution, groups of royalists loyal to the House of Bourbon rose up against the new government. One group was the Chouans of Brittany, led by Jean Chouan. They allied {{themselves}} with counter-revolutionary forces in <b>Vendée</b> and by 1793 the Revolt in the <b>Vendée</b> had begun. The insurrection was put down by the republic, and within two years the royalist forces had been routed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} Bourbon Restoration, Louis XVIII {{appointed}} Defrance as inspector general of cavalry. During the Hundred Days, Napoleon's brief return to France, Jean-Marie Defrance commanded {{part of the}} Armée de l'Ouest. This Army of the West was also called the Army of the <b>Vendée</b> and the Army of the Loire. Under overall command of Jean Maximilien Lamarque, one of Napoleon's fiercest supporters, it was formed to suppress potential Royalist insurrection in the <b>Vendée</b> region of France. Defrance {{did not participate in}} the Battle of Rocheserviere, in which Lemarque's army brutally crushed the anticipated Vendéen uprising. He remained instead at his post of the 18th military division, inspecting the cavalry depots in the upper Loire. Defrance retained his rank after the second restoration and commanded the First Military Division in Paris from 1819 to 1822. He also taught at the military school in Rebais.|$|E
5|$|The Poitevin breed {{has very}} low numbers. In 2011, there were 71 new foals {{registered}} with the studbook. The same year, 227 mares were covered, with 171 being bred to Poitevin stallions. There were 33 stallions registered and 80 active breeders. These numbers represent a decrease from the previous year. Over the past decade, {{the highest number of}} foals registered was 113 in 2008, and between 80 and 90 foals were registered in the other years. The majority of breeding farms are located in the Poitou area, including <b>Vendée</b> (especially around Fontenay-le-Comte and Luçon), Deux-Sèvres (especially near Melle), Vienna and Civray, and some in Charente, near Ruffec. There are National Studs located in Saintes and <b>Vendée.</b> There are a few breeders in Maine-et-Loire.|$|E
5|$|The team sent squads to the Châteauroux Classic, the GP Ouest-France, Paris–Brussels, the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec, the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal, the Grand Prix de Wallonie, the Tour de <b>Vendée,</b> and Paris–Tours, but {{finished}} {{no higher}} than 11th {{in any of these}} races.|$|E
5|$|Today, Norman Cobs {{are mainly}} {{found in the}} {{departments}} of Manche, Calvados and Orne, which form {{the area where the}} breed was originally developed. The region of Saint-Lo, which ranks first in the production of Norman Cobs, represents 35 percent of new births. The Norman Cob is also present around the Haras de la <b>Vendee</b> (Stud at <b>Vendee),</b> which represents 25 percent of births, the Haras du Pin and in central Massif. In 2004, there were just over 600 French breeders of the Norman Cob, and in 2005, 914 Norman Cob mares were bred, with 65 stallions recorded as active in France. In recent years, the number of Norman Cobs has remained relatively stable. In 2011, there were 319 Norman Cob births in France, and numbers of annual births between 1992 and 2010 ranged between 385 and 585.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the War in the <b>Vendée</b> {{and peace}} with Spain, {{substantial}} French forces were made available for the operation, to be led by General Hoche and scheduled for the end of October 1796. Hoche was a successful military commander, who had defeated the <b>Vendée</b> Royalists and been subsequently engaged in planning the Cornish invasion. A body of veteran soldiers and the entire French Atlantic Fleet were placed at his disposal, based in the major Atlantic seaport of Brest. The number of soldiers earmarked for the invasion is uncertain: the French Directory suggested 25,000 men would be required, the Irish delegates insisting that 15,000 would be sufficient. Estimates of the number of soldiers eventually embarked range between 13,500 and 20,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, two representatives on mission {{informed}} the National Convention of the disquieting condition of <b>Vendée,</b> and this news was quickly {{followed by the}} exposure of a royalist plot organized by the Marquis de la Rouerie. It {{was not until the}} social unrest combined with the external pressures from the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790) and the introduction of a levy of 300,000 on the whole of France, decreed by the National Convention in February 1793, that the region erupted.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the two stages held in <b>Vendée</b> started in Passage du Gois and {{finished}} in Mont des Alouettes, whilst stage two was held in Les Essarts. The Tour left <b>Vendée</b> in Olonne-sur-Mer and headed north to Redon for the finish of the third stage. The following two stages {{took place in the}} region of Brittany. Stage six left the region to the finish in Lisieux. Stages seven and eight took the race through the middle of the country from Le Mans to the Super Besse resort in the elevated region Massif Central, which hosted stage nine. The following two stages headed south through the lower slopes, and stage twelve took the race into the Pyrenees. The mountain range hosted the next two stages. The fifteenth stage took place between Limoux and Montpellier. Stage sixteen took the route into the Alps. The next two stages took the race into Italy, with Pinerolo hosting between them. Stage nineteen was the last in the Alps, before the twentieth, which was held in the foothills around Grenoble. A long transfer took the Tour to its conclusion in Paris with the Champs-Élysées stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} had good showings from Nocentini at the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal (ninth place), Mondory at the Grand Prix de la Somme (second place), Montaguti at the Gran Premio Industria e Commercio di Prato (third place), Bouet at the Tour de <b>Vendée</b> (third place), and Roche at the Giro del Piemonte (fifth place). Roche also took the team's best placing at the fall monument, the Giro di Lombardia, {{but was a}} {{relatively}} distant 16th on the day.|$|E
5|$|As the stallions of the Poitevin breed {{could not}} be used to produce mules, they were {{generally}} sold as two-year-olds at the summer fair in <b>Vendée</b> and the winter fair in Saint-Maixent, as well as to horse merchants in Berry, Beauce, Perche and the Midi. In these areas, they were used for agriculture. In Paris, they were used for pulling omnibuses, and the French military used the Poitevin for pulling artillery. At the beginning of the 21st century there has been a new demand for mules for leisure purposes, but this demand cannot be filled by Poitevin mares until their numbers have recovered to a sufficient level.|$|E
5|$|By 1795, Bonaparte {{had become}} engaged to Désirée Clary, {{daughter}} of François Clary. Désirée's sister Julie Clary had married Bonaparte's elder brother Joseph. In April 1795, {{he was assigned}} to the Army of the West, which was engaged in the War in the Vendée—a civil war and royalist counter-revolution in <b>Vendée,</b> a region in west central France on the Atlantic Ocean. As an infantry command, it was a demotion from artillery general—for which the army already had a full quota—and he pleaded poor health to avoid the posting.|$|E
5|$|He {{was moved}} to the Bureau of Topography of the Committee of Public Safety and sought unsuccessfully to be {{transferred}} to Constantinople in order to offer his services to the Sultan. During this period, he wrote the romantic novella Clisson et Eugénie, about a soldier and his lover, in a clear parallel to Bonaparte's own relationship with Désirée. On 15 September, Bonaparte was removed from the list of generals in regular service for his refusal to serve in the <b>Vendée</b> campaign. He faced a difficult financial situation and reduced career prospects.|$|E
5|$|Oysters {{come from}} the Oléron-Marennes basin, while mussels {{come from the}} Bay of Aiguillon. High-quality produce comes from the region's hinterland, {{especially}} goat cheese. This region and in the <b>Vendée</b> is grazing ground for Parthenaise cattle, while poultry is raised in Challans. The region of Poitou-Charentes purportedly produces the best butter and cream in France. Cognac is also made in the region along the Charente River. Limousin {{is home to the}} high-quality Limousin cattle, as well as high quality sheep. The woodlands offer game and high-quality mushrooms. The southern area around Brive draws its cooking influence from Périgord and Auvergne to produce a robust cuisine.|$|E
5|$|Cousin took ninth at the Polynormande, {{in fourth}} {{position}} from the peloton behind five breakaway riders. Haddou took fifth {{in a field}} sprint at the Châteauroux Classic, behind 's Anthony Ravard. Voeckler took a podium finish at the GP Ouest-France. 's Grega Bole broke away in the final kilometer to win the race, and Simon Gerrans and Voeckler tried to bridge up to him. Though everyone in the peloton had the same time at the finish, Bole, Gerrans, and Voeckler finished {{just ahead of the}} main field, in that order to round out the podium. Voeckler also turned in the team's best ride at the Tour de la Somme, finishing ninth in the field sprint. At the Tour de <b>Vendée,</b> which took place not far from the team's headquarters, they had two riders take top-ten placings, Charteau in sixth and Quemeneur in seventh.|$|E
5|$|Enthusiasts {{worked to}} reorient the breed towards driving and {{recreation}} pursuits, and since 1982 have again reorganized the breed association. In 1992, a new studbook {{was created for}} the breed, with new selection criteria designed to preserve {{the quality of the}} breed, particularly its gaits. The latest editions of the breed registry and studbook are controlled by the Syndicat national des éleveurs et utilisateurs de chevaux Cob normand (SNEUCCN, National Union of Farmers and Users of Normandy Cob Horses), based in Tessy-sur-Vire. The association works to preserve and promote the breed throughout France, focusing especially on Normandy, <b>Vendee</b> and Anjou. In 1994, Normandy contained 2000 Percheron and Norman Cob horses, and annually bred around 600 foals of these two breeds. This included approximately half of the Norman Cobs bred in France.|$|E
5|$|Republican campaigns, {{the core}} of Bonaparte's reserve was 30,000 men, mostly from the Batavian Republic, who had been used under Guillaume Marie Anne Brune to crush the {{rebellion}} in the <b>Vendée.</b> Additional veteran troops came from {{the remains of the}} former Army of England. The new mililary doctrine emphasised the offensive, mobility and the bayonet, over linear firepower. In front of the Austrian army were stationed, in and to the south of Marengo, the corps of Victor (Jacques-Antoine de Chambarlhac de Laubespin and Gaspard Amédée Gardanne's divisions), supported on the left by François Étienne de Kellermann's cavalry and, further to the northeast, by the corps of Lannes (François Watrin's division, Mainoni's brigade) together with two cavalry brigades. To the east of Castel Ceriolo took position Jean-Charles Monnier's division, supported by the Guard, which formed the reserve. Victor was the one who would bear the brunt of the Austrian attack.|$|E
5|$|Seine had a rapid passage back to European waters, {{arriving}} in the Bay of Biscay on 28 June. Early the following morning, with the Brittany coast in sight, Seine was spotted by the inshore frigate squadron of HMS Jason, HMS Pique and HMS Mermaid. While Mermaid cut Seine off from the coast, Jason and Pique gave chase as Seine fled southwards. Pique reached Seine at 23:00 that evening and {{for more than two}} and a half hours the frigates pounded at one another until Pique fell back. Pique and Jason continued the chase full speed through the night, until suddenly all three frigates crashed headlong into the sandbanks off La Tranche-sur-Mer on the <b>Vendée</b> coast. Even while grounded the frigates continued to fire on one another until Mermaid finally arrived and the outnumbered Seine surrendered. Jason and Seine were badly damaged but successfully refloated, the casualties on the packed decks of the French ship appallingly high, but Pique was an irretrievable wreck: the ship was evacuated and then burnt before the remainder of the squadron returned to Britain with their prize.|$|E
5|$|The First French Republic {{had long}} planned an {{invasion}} of the British Isles, but their ambitions had been repeatedly thwarted by other factors, including other fronts of the Revolutionary Wars, the War in the <b>Vendée</b> and the parlous state of the French Navy. This latter problem was a major cause for concern: the Navy had suffered heavily from the removal of its officer corps during the Revolution and then endured a series of military setbacks, culminating in the tactical defeat at the Glorious First of June in 1794 and the disastrous Croisière du Grand Hiver in 1795. After securing peace on several fronts in 1795, the new French Directory decided that Britain {{was one of their}} most dangerous remaining opponents, and they determined to defeat it through invasion.|$|E
5|$|The team {{achieved}} more top-ten placings in September, taking six {{within the}} space of a week; Božič finished ninth in the Memorial Rik Van Steenbergen, and sixth in Paris–Brussels, while Leukemans finished sixth in the Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec World Tour race, and third on his return to Europe, in the Grand Prix de Wallonie. Feillu and Marcato each took a seventh place in the Grand Prix de Fourmies, and the Grand Prix Cycliste de Montréal respectively. Mouris and Keizer finished third in Duo Normand, while on the same day, Božič finished fourth in the Grand Prix d'Isbergues. In October, Marcato took his first professional win in the Tour de <b>Vendée,</b> and also finished second to 's Greg Van Avermaet in Paris–Tours, Feillu finished eighth in Paris–Bourges, and Devolder finished seventh in the Chrono des Nations time trial. Hoogerland completed the team's year, in November, with third place in the Amstel Curaçao Race.|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} few {{noteworthy}} performances in later-season single-day races. Sánchez held the Clásica de San Sebastián {{as a target}} for his season, hoping {{to be the first}} Euskaltel-Euskadi rider to win the race. Sánchez rode {{at the front of the}} race most of the day, until the winner Philippe Gilbert made his signature solo attack to earn victory. Sánchez finished near the back of the chase pack 14 seconds down the road, for eighth place on the day. Izagirre just missed the podium at the Prueba Villafranca de Ordizia, finishing fourth in a five-man escape that decided the race. Near the end of the season, the team did obtain a podium finish. Trainee rider Peio Bilbao finished second in October's Tour de <b>Vendée.</b> He was just edged out by 's Marco Marcato in a five-man sprint finish. Only 14 riders officially completed this race due to race organizers strictly enforcing the time cut.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-two teams {{participated in}} the 2011 edition of the Tour de France. All {{eighteen}} UCI ProTeams were entitled, and obliged, to enter the race. On 19 January 2011, the organiser of the Tour, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), announced the four second-tier UCI Professional Continental teams given wildcard invitations, {{all of which were}} French-based. One team, the Spanish-based , which included the third-placed rider in the 2010 Tour, Denis Menchov, and the 2008 Tour winner, Carlos Sastre, was overlooked. The presentation of the teams– where the members of each team's roster are introduced in front of the media and local dignitaries– took place in front of audience of 7,000 inside the Roman amphitheatre at the Puy du Fou theme park in Les Epesses, <b>Vendée,</b> on 30 June, two days before the opening stage.|$|E
5|$|Van Dijk then reeled off {{a run of}} five {{consecutive}} races in which he finished as the team's best rider. The run began {{towards the end of}} August with a tenth place finish in the Schaal Sels-Merksem event, which was followed by a trio of fourth places in early-September at the Grote Prijs Jef Scherens, the Memorial Rik Van Steenbergen, and Paris–Brussels, before a third place the day after, in the Grand Prix de Fourmies. Later in the month, van Dijk finished eighth in the Kampioenschap van Vlaanderen, and second behind 's Guillaume Van Keirsbulck in Omloop van het Houtland. October brought the team three final top ten placings; Verbist finished eighth in the Tour de <b>Vendée,</b> Vernaeckt took his best result of the season with ninth place in Binche–Tournai–Binche, and van Dijk concluded his season with fifth place in the final Belgian race of the season, the Nationale Sluitingsprijs.|$|E
5|$|The team secured several high {{placings}} in {{the later}} season, but did not obtain any victories. In late July, the team took two of the top six placings at the Polynormande, with El Fares in second and Gallopin in sixth. El Fares {{had been part of}} a breakaway, and Gallopin first from the peloton four and a half minutes back. The result put Gallopin into the lead in the French Road Cycling Cup, the year-long competition among French single-day races where French riders, and those on French teams, can earn points. Cusin came eighth at the Tour du Doubs in September. Petit just missed out on the podium at the Grand Prix de Fourmies, finishing fourth in a large field sprint. He made the podium in a similar finish at Binche–Tournai–Binche in October, finishing third. Also in October, Dumoulin took ninth place at Paris–Bourges, from a selective sprint of ten riders. Duque was seventh in a leading group of thirteen at the Grand Prix de la Somme. Though he won only the one race, Gallopin's consistent high finishes in the French single-day races made him the overall victor of the season-long French Road Cycling Cup, which he clinched after the Tour de <b>Vendée.</b>|$|E
25|$|René François Lecomte, born 14 May 1764 in Fontenay-le-Comte (<b>Vendée),</b> died on 15 October 1793 in Bressuire (Deux-Sèvres), was {{a general}} of the French Revolutionary Wars, and, in particular, the War in the <b>Vendée.</b>|$|E

When the revolutionaries wanted to reduce the Church's influence, people of the <b>Vendée</b> region considered this unimaginable.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of the War in the <b>Vendée,</b> the local Vendeans offered to make Royrand their leader but he was reluctant to accept at first. He was soon recognized as leader of the so-called Army of the Center which defended the southern front of the <b>Vendée.</b> He proved to be a capable organizer while assigning his second-in-command Charles Sapinaud de La Rairie to lead the rebels in the field. The rebels formed into three main forces of which the Army of Upper <b>Vendée</b> was the largest, with up to 50,000 men. The Army of Lower <b>Vendée</b> under former naval officer François de Charette had as many as 20,000 rebels in the western marshes, while the Army of the Center counted between 10,000 and 12,000 men in the area around Les Herbiers and Chantonnay.|$|E
25|$|In 1797, he {{published}} additional papers on his {{difficulties in the}} <b>Vendee.</b>|$|E
25|$|Peter McPhee {{says that}} the pacification of the <b>Vendée</b> does not fit either the United Nations' CPPCG {{definition}} of genocide because the events happened during a civil war. He states {{that the war in}} the <b>Vendée</b> was not a one-sided mass killing and the Committee of Public Safety did not intend to exterminate the whole population of the Vendée; parts of the population were allied to the revolutionary government.|$|E
25|$|According to Theodore A. Dodge, {{the war in}} the <b>Vendée</b> lasted with {{intensity}} from 1793 to 1799, when it was suppressed, {{but later}} broke out spasmodically especially in 1813, 1814 and 1815. During Napoleon's Hundred Days in 1815, some {{of the population of the}} <b>Vendée</b> remained loyal to Louis XVIII, forcing Napoleon – who was short of troops to fight the Waterloo Campaign – to send a force of 10,000 under the command of Jean Maximilien Lamarque to pacify the region.|$|E
25|$|On 24 February 1793 the National Convention ordered mass {{conscription}} {{to fill up}} armies depleted by desertion. The <b>Vendée</b> rebellion was {{provoked by}} conscription, the anti-Catholic laws promulgated by the Convention and {{the high cost of}} food. The revolt broke out in March and soon 50,000 Vendean rebels were at large. There were three main rebel forces, the largest of which was the Army of Upper <b>Vendée</b> or Grand Army, controlling as many as 50,000 men. Its leaders were Charles de Bonchamps, Jacques Cathelineau, Louis d'Elbée, Louis Marie de Lescure, Henri de La Rochejaquelein and Jean-Nicolas Stofflet. The two other significant bodies were the Army of Lower <b>Vendée</b> under François de Charette with 15,000–20,000 men in the Marais (western marshes) and the Army of the Center led by Charles Aimé de Royrand with 10,000–12,000 rebels in the area around Les Herbiers and Chantonnay.|$|E
25|$|Yacht races {{have been}} held in the Southern Ocean, such as the Volvo Ocean Race, Velux 5 Oceans Race, <b>Vendée</b> Globe, Jules Verne Trophy and Global Challenge.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Vendée</b> voted 29.7% for Sarkozy, 21.7% for Royal, 20.8% for Bayrou, and 11.3% for Philippe de Villiers, deputy of the department. Le Pen. meanwhile, managed only 6.5%.|$|E
25|$|During the French Revolution and {{the revolt}} in the <b>Vendée</b> that followed, blue was the colour {{worn by the}} {{soldiers}} of the Revolutionary government, while the royalists wore white.|$|E
25|$|Created in 1977, the Puy du Fou {{is a much}} celebrated {{theme park}} in <b>Vendée,</b> France. It is {{centered}} around European, French and local history. It received several international prizes.|$|E
25|$|He {{was rescued}} after {{capsizing}} during the 1996 <b>Vendée</b> Globe single-handed around-the-world race. The race {{was marked by}} a number of incidents, including the death of another contestant, Gerry Roufs.|$|E
