25|$|He {{was convicted}} of several murders, and {{received}} six life sentences, {{as well as the}} death sentence. He confessed to the attempted murders of two prominent men: the magazine publisher Larry Flynt in 1978 and <b>Vernon</b> <b>Jordan</b> Jr., the civil rights activist, in 1980. Both survived their injuries, but Flynt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Franklin was not convicted in either of those cases. Because Franklin repeatedly changed his accounts of some crimes, and was not charged in some cases in which he was suspected, officials cannot determine the full extent of his crimes. His claims of racial motivation were offset by a defense expert witness who testified in 1997 that Franklin was a paranoid schizophrenic who was not fit to stand trial.|$|E
