50|$|Canada is {{a federal}} state, and {{responsibility}} for road safety with respect to drunk driving falls on both Parliament and the provincial legislatures. Typically after an impaired driving offence is committed, the accused {{will be subject to}} both a prohibition imposed under federal law (criminal law) and a driver's licence suspension under provincial law. It {{is important to note that}} while Parliament may prohibit an accused from driving, in the absence of provincial legislation, this does not affect the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the driver's <b>licence</b> <b>of</b> the accused. Nonetheless the accused may be charged with driving while prohibited under criminal law despite possessing a valid driver's licence.|$|R

5000|$|The airline chose Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, as {{its first}} {{operating}} base in Africa, with flights from Julius Nyerere International Airport commencing on 29 November 2012. Initially flights operated successfully between Dar es Salaam and Kilimanjaro, and between Dar es Salaam and Mwanza. Further routes were to be added quickly, both domestically and to other East African destinations, and FastJet said it would move its operation office from Tanzania to Kenya, once it has approval to operate in Kenya. Once established in East Africa, FastJet also had plans to launch in Ghana and Angola, other Fly540 areas of operation, but all these expansion plans appear to have become embroiled in a public dispute between Fastjet and the original Fly540 management regarding outstanding debts and <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> operating <b>licences.</b> [...] In May 2014 Fly540 Ghana and Fly540 Angola were both shut down as they were incompatible with the Fastjet low cost model.|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{drivers who}} are {{required}} {{to compete in the}} FIA Formula One World Championship under the nationality of their passport, the FIA's International Sporting Code states that teams competing in the FIA Formula One World Championship shall compete under the nationality of their parent National Automobile Club that issued their FIA racing licence. On the basis of this regulation, despite the fact that most current teams are based in the UK, this country is officially represented in Formula One only by teams holding a racing licence issued by the British National Sporting Authority. Teams take the nationality of their parent National Automobile Club that issued their licence for the period <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> that <b>licence</b> and the change of the nationality is allowed. Several teams changed their nationality during their competition in Formula One (e.g. Shadow in 1976 from American to British, Benetton in 1996 from British to Italian, Renault in 2011 from French to British). Benetton is the only team to have achieved victories while racing under two different nationalities.|$|R
