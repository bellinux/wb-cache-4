25|$|Mass {{finishing}} is a {{group of}} manufacturing processes that allow large quantities of parts to be simultaneously finished. The goal of this type of finishing is to burnish, deburr, clean, radius, de-flash, descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare parts for further finishing, or break off die cast runners. The two main types of mass finishing are tumble finishing, also known as barrel finishing, and <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing.</b> Both involve the use of a cyclical action to create grinding contact between surfaces. Sometimes the workpieces are finished against each other; however, usually a finishing medium is used. Mass finishing can be performed dry or wet; wet processes have liquid lubricants, cleaners, or abrasives, while dry processes do not. Cycle times can be as short as 10minutes for nonferrous workpieces or as long as 2hours for hardened steel.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} of surface {{evolution in the}} <b>vibratory</b> media <b>finishing</b> process is investigated through changes in surface profiles with process time. Using {{the profile of a}} masked portion of the surface as reference, changes in the surface profile mean line, peaks and valleys with time are examined. Peak heights are seen to reduce while surprisingly valley depths are also seen to diminish indicating evidence of plastic displacement of material from the peaks into the valleys. The surface evolution is thus shown to be a combination of material removal and plastic deformation of the peaks. This also partially explains the surface roughness saturation with time...|$|R
2500|$|Part separation: A very {{important}} {{function of the}} medium is to separate parts during the deburring, cutting, surface improving or burnishing operations. [...] The media:parts volume ratio is normally used to control the amount of part-on-part contact which will occur in a <b>vibratory</b> or tumble <b>finishing</b> operation. [...] At low ratios, considerable part-on-part contact occurs, while at higher ratios part-on-part contact is limited.|$|R

50|$|Rock {{polishing}} is a lapidary {{process whereby}} rough stone is polished and smoothed by hand or using simple machines to produce attractive stones. The most common means is tumble polishing, but a <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing</b> {{process can be}} used instead.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>vibratory</b> media <b>finishing</b> {{process is}} known for its long process time and there is an {{industrial}} need to speed up this process. Increasing frequency and amplitude of vibration, beyond the current process window commonly used, is an option to reduce process time. Using a laboratory scale electro-magnetic shaker setup, the effects of increasing frequency and amplitude of vibration is investigated. By monitoring the surface roughness with processing time it is shown that, while for a given amplitude frequency has a strong effect, amplitude in general has a stronger effect in quickening the time to saturation. Using high-speed camera measurements in a transparent bowl it is also shown that the average media speed increases with increase in frequency and this can partially explain the resulting shorter process time...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the annual}} stockholders' meeting on 12 December 1883 {{a letter from}} Keely was read out, in which the {{inventor}} {{said that he could}} not see why he might not fulfil the shareholders' expectations in the next two months and suggested that the stockholders' meeting be postponed to 1 February 1884. This proposal met with some disagreement from some stockholders, and it was decided to give Keely no funds for the next 60 days. When the promised stockholders' meeting was held on 1 February 1884, another postponement was announced at Keely's request. A board meeting which took place on 25 March 1884 reported that the <b>vibratory</b> engine was <b>finished,</b> that [...] "the work of adjusting and focalizing is progressing rapidly", and that Keely had set the date for the demonstration of the motor to take place on or before 10 April.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the {{apparent}} rubbing action of particles against parts, studies [...] {{show that the}} primary mechanism of material removal in <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing</b> is erosion caused by the relatively normal impacts of particles on parts. These impacts occur at the same frequency as the vibration, and at impact velocities of less than 1 m/s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vibratory</b> <b>finishing</b> systems tend {{to produce}} a smooth finish because the media {{essentially}} laps the parts. Since the load is moving as a unit, very fragile parts are quite safe in the vibrator. There is no tearing action or unequal forces that tend to bend and distort parts. The larger the parts or media are, the faster the cutting action.|$|E
50|$|The process {{starts with}} a {{standard}} salt bath nitrocarburizing cycle, which produces a layer of ε iron nitride.Next, the workpiece is mechanically polished; typical polishing processes include <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing,</b> lapping, and centerless grinding. Finally, the workpiece is re-immersed into the salt quench bath for 20 to 30 minutes, rinsed, and oil dipped. This last step optimizes the corrosion resistance by creating a layer of iron oxide about 3 to 4 micrometers thick. It also gives the workpiece a black finish.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} the increased performance possibilities of screws on submersible pumps by <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing</b> of their surfaces. Method. The <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing</b> method {{is based on}} two principles: rejection of light plastic deformation polishing {{as well as the}} complication of kinematics associated with known cold working processes. Results. A schematic diagram of vibratory finishing; the compiled graphs show pressure, occurring in the surface layer of steel 30 KhGSA when lathe turning and vibratory finishing; the microhardness dependence on the work hardening distribution depth at rolling and <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing</b> is determined. It is established that since <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing</b> is a method of hardening, kinematic and dynamic characteristics of the process are connected, as in other types of finishing, with characteristic indicators of machined surfaces. The task of developing methods for determining the <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing</b> regime is complicated, firstly by the number of parameters that determine the process conditions being considerably greater than tumbling and other processing methods with relatively simple kinematics; secondly, {{due to the fact that}} all the mode parameters affect all surface quality characteristics in one way or another. Conclusion. When <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing</b> the surface layer of a screw submerged in a vibratory machine, using steel shots for burnishing, an extension of the surface layer's elastic-plastic deformation to a certain depth is achieved. The temperature at the time of <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing,</b> according to conventional standards, does not exceed 150 - 300 OC; moreover, it decreases sharply with increasing depth and at room temperature is already at the depth of 0. 1 - 0. 3 mm from the surface of the screw. Microrelief optimisation of the bearing surfaces is the most effective way to improve conformability, reduce the run-in and normal wear and improve anti-seize properties. The efficiency and potential for the use of <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing</b> in virtually all areas of the metal industry is proven. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} {{investigations}} on <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing</b> and an approach towards a process model combining the Discrete Element Method (DEM) with experimental {{results will be}} presented. Based on experimental data from <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing</b> and drag finishing experiments, material removal is considered on a surface roughness level, leading to a new model for surface roughness prediction. The influence of several abrasive particles and process parameters on the surface topography formation was investigated using steel rods with different topographies. Core findings include differing material removal mechanisms depending on initial surface roughness and a first description {{of the influence of}} particle shape on surface topography formation. To develop a comprehensive process model for <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing,</b> DEM is used to model the motion of the bulk of abrasive particles and its contacts with the workpiece. Given the results from the simulation such as number, intensity and location of contacts for a set of boundary conditions, such as workpiece speed and bowl excitation, experimental findings can be linked to these computable results...|$|E

The presentation opens with a short introduction to typical mass finishing processes, followed by a brief discussion on their respective correspondences to GFD regimes, and ends which some illustrative results arising from the application of this framework to <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing,</b> which is perhaps the most industrially pervasive mass finishing process...|$|E
40|$|<b>Vibratory</b> <b>Finishing</b> is a {{commonly}} used process for deburring and polishing. The process effectiveness {{is difficult to}} quantify due to a nexus of variables relating to workpiece, media, compound and machine. In this paper, effect of orientation of rectangular Al 6061 workpieces is considered {{with respect to the}} motion of ceramic media using water as lubricant. It is found that parallel orientation of workpiece to media motion and higher lubrication level lead to higher degree of sliding, thereby leading to smoother finish. Experiments with different ceramic media showed smoother finish with the geometry more susceptible to rounding. The aforesaid findings can be employed in applications requiring superpolished surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Adipose-derived {{stem cells}} (ASCs) {{are of a}} great {{importance}} for bone tissue engineering. We compared ASCs obtained by liposuction under two pressures (- 200 mmHg and - 700 mmHg). The number and proliferation activity of cells isolated under - 700 mmHg (ASC-H) were higher than in cells isolated under - 200 mmHg (ASC-L). However, the ASC-L was more active in osteogenic differentiation, as manifested by a higher intensity of fluorescence of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin in these cells. The adhesion and growth of ASCs were then studied on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V samples either unmodified (K, roughness parameter R-a = 280 nm) or modified by shot blasting and tarnishing A, R-a = 200 nm), <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing</b> (B, R-a = 100 nm) and <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing,</b> shot blasting and polishing (C, R-a = 80 nm). All modified samples were more wettable than the K samples. On day 1 after seeding, the size of cell spreading area on some modified samples was lower than on K samples, namely on B samples in ASC-L, on B and C in ASC-H and on A in control MG- 63 cells. On day 3, the cell number on some modified samples became higher than on K samples, namely on C samples (ASC-L), on B (ASC-H) and on B and C s (MG- 63 cells). On day 7, the numbers of ASC-H and MG- 63 cells on all modified samples evened out and became significantly higher than on K samples. On ASC-L samples, the highest cell numbers were obtained on A samples. Thus, all studied modifications of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V enhanced growth of ASCs and human osteoblast-like MG- 63 cells...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHigh {{intensity}} {{shot peening}} treatments have been {{combined with other}} different second treatments, such as low intensity shot peening, <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing</b> and grit blasting with fine alumina powders, in order to optimize the fatigue life of a medium-alloyed, quenched and tempered, structural steel with a very high strength (2000 MPa). Single low intensity shot peening treatments using ceramic balls were also used with the same objective. Roughness and residual stress profiles were measured, while the fatigue behavior was analyzed using a rotating bending fatigue equipment. Fracture surfaces were also analyzed in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) {{and the location of}} the fatigue crack initiation was detected. Although the maximum stress in our fatigue tests is always applied {{on the surface of the}} specimen, the appropriate surface treatment combinations were able to optimize the fatigue response of the steel until the point where the fatigue crack initiated in the specimen interior (subsurface nucleation), due to the microstructural stress concentration provided by small alumina inclusions present in the microstructure of the steel. The amplitude of the stress intensity factor necessary to propagate fatigue cracks in the studied steel and the intrinsic stress intensity factor threshold, ΔKth, were finally obtained...|$|E
40|$|The wear of {{machines}} and mechanisms after rubbing {{is a major}} concern. The costs of manufacturing and restoration parts for agricultural machinery are enormous such as the trunnions pinions of hydraulic pumps. Finishing treatment antifriction without abrasive (FTAA) is the existing method of manufacturing and restoration, but it has disadvantages like low work efficiency and the frequent replacement of the instrument. That is why a new method of FTAA parts type ''tree' ' has been developed called <b>vibratory</b> <b>finishing</b> treatment antifriction without abrasive, (VFTAA) method. The study was conducted at the laboratory of the State Technical University of Kirovograd (Ukraine) where turn 16 K 20, the profilograph-profilometer "Talysurf- 5 ", the scanning electron microscope REM- 106 I, friction machine MI- 1 M and the stand KI- 28097 - 02 M were used respectively for machining, study of micro relief {{before and after the}} VFTAA, microstructure, wear resistance and the determination of the break-in period of parts. The results showed that the VFTAA helped reduce the roughness Ra of the samples studied by half compared to the samples processed by polishing and 1. 3 times compared to those treated with the FTAA, the break-in period has been reduced four times, this leads to an increase {{in the life of the}} hydraulic pump. This technology can be recommended for manufacturing and repair of hydraulic units of agricultural machineries...|$|E
