[...] The driver was {{provided with a}} full set of instruments including a speedometer with a built in odometer, oil pressure and fuel level gauges and an ammeter. [...] The more modern design of the Morris was reflected in the superior performance of its hydraulically operated 8-inch drum brakes. [...] The Morris also scored over its Ford rival by incorporating an electric windscreen wiper rather than the more old-fashioned <b>vacuum</b> <b>powered</b> equivalent, while its relatively wide 45 inch track aided directional stability on corners.|$|E

50|$|Packard's Ultramatic {{transmission}} was {{the creation}} of the company's chief engineer Forest McFarland and his engineering team. The magnitude of the accomplishment is illustrated {{by the fact that it}} was the only automatic transmission produced solely by an independent automaker with no outside help. Devices like the Ultramatic were being tested and designed by Packard from 1935 on, but none sufficed the perfectionist engineer. The Ultramatic's development was halted as was all automotive work during World War II, but resumed in earnest during 1946. Packard, during this period, was suffering in competition with Cadillac, thanks to their popular self-shifting Hydra-Matic, which was available starting in 1941 and became popular during 1946-1948. Packard at that time only offered an Electromatic Vacuum Clutch option, which required manual shifting, and as most <b>vacuum</b> <b>powered</b> shifting, and clutching devices, was generally unreliable. In 1949, Packard's 50th anniversary, McFarland's Ultramatic Drive became available as a $199 option. It was first offered only on the De-Luxe Packard Customs.|$|E
5000|$|A {{vacuum system}} {{can be used for}} power transmission, {{although}} the maximum power that can be transmitted to a vacuum motor is less than conventional pneumatics. There is an optimum pressure for the operation of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>power</b> transmission system, of around 0.4bara (8 psig), as Downie also shows. Although less efficient than pneumatics, it can be perfectly workable. For example a 22mm (7/8") pipe on vacuum can transmit as much power on 0.4 bara (8 psig) as a 6mm (1/4") pipe on 8bara (100 psig). The system is efficient enough that Boulton and Watt used <b>vacuum</b> <b>power</b> transmission in their factory. They called the vacuum main in the factory the ‘spirit pipe’.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{interests}} in responsive launch have highlighted {{the need for}} rapid and fully automated ascent guidance planning and guidance parameter generation for launch vehicles. This dissertation aims at developing methodology and algorithms for on-demand generation of optimal launch vehicle ascent trajectories from lift-off to achieving targeting conditions outside the atmosphere. The entire ascent trajectory from lift-off to final target point {{is divided into two}} parts: atmospheric ascent portion and vacuum ascent portion. The two portions are integrated via a fixed-point iteration based on the continuity condition at the switch point between atmospheric ascent portion and vacuum ascent portion;The previous research works on closed-loop endo-atmospheric ascent guidance shows that the classical finite difference method is well suited for fast solution of the constrained optimal three-dimensional ascent problem. The exploitation of certain unique features in the integration procedure between the atmospheric portion and vacuum portion and the finite difference method, allows us to cast the atmospheric ascent problem into a nested fixed-point iteration problem. Therefore a novel Fixed-Point Iteration algorithm is presented for solving the endo-atmospheric ascent guidance problem. Several approaches are also provided for facilitating the convergence of the fixed-point iteration. The exo-atmospheric ascent portion allows an optimal coast in between the two <b>vacuum</b> <b>powered</b> stages. The optimal coast enables more efficient usage of the propellant. The Analytical Multiple-Shooting algorithm is developed to find the optimal trajectory for this portion;A generic launch vehicle model is adopted in the numerical simulation. A series of open-loop and closed-loop simulations are performed. The results verify the effectiveness, robustness and reliability of the Fixed-Point Iteration (FPI) algorithm and Analytical Multiple-Shooting (AMS) algorithm developed in this research. In comparison to Finite Difference (FD) algorithm, the Fixed-Point Iteration algorithm is more adaptive to the 2 ̆ 2 cold start 2 ̆ 2 case for endoatmospheric ascent guiDance; The simulations also validate the feasibility of the methodology presented in this research in rapid panning and guidance for ascent through atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|Seaweed {{has been}} {{collected}} in northern New England for agricultural purposes {{since the first}} settlers arrived over three hundred years ago. Today seaweed is still gathered along the coast, but the techniques used and technologies employed, have drastically altered the industry. While people once gathered seaweed by hand from open boats, today <b>vacuum</b> <b>powered</b> mechanical harvesters are frequently utilized and the seaweed gathered is taken to specialized processing plants. It is here that the dried material {{is transformed into a}} variety of products, such as liquid fertilizer and animal feed. One person operating a mechanical harvester is capable of harvesting twenty-two thousand pounds of seaweed in one day, for which harvesters are generally paid 20 - 30 per wet ton. Rockweed, the dominant intertidal seaweed on the Northern Atlantic coast, takes two and a half to three years to recover to preharvest density, depending on the intensity of the harvest and productivity of the site. The super-efficient harvesting methods that are now commonplace in Maine can be ecologically damaging when practiced irresponsibly. Members of the scientific community have voiced their concerns about the effect of harvesting of seaweed on the many juvenile fish species that rely on seaweed as a source of food and habitat. When it is overharvested, as it has been in sections of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, the marine ecosystem as a whole suffers. Interest in harvesting Maine 2 ̆ 7 s rockweed resource on a large-scale commercial basis has increased in recent years, particularly from Canadian processors. Local concern over the impacts of unregulated harvests has grown along with the increase in demand for seaweed. Very little is known about how harvesting impacts the long-term health of large beds of seaweeds and the marine creatures and plants associated with them. As Christopher Lobban has noted, 2 ̆ 2 [sleaweeds do not merely influence the habitat-to a large extent they are the habitat. 2 ̆ 2 Anyone who has observed a healthy submerged rockweed community will attest to its forest like appearance. These vast underwater forests provide shelter and habitat to many species of juvenile fish and crustaceans, including many commercially valuable species. A recent Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) report identifies rockweed growing low in the intertidal zone as a nursery for young lobsters. Seaweed provides not only shelter, but also food to a variety of fish, birds, and crustaceans. Seaweed is a valuable primary producer, and its place {{at the bottom of the}} food chain makes it a vital component of a healthy marine ecosystem. The recent friction in Maine among commercial seaweed harvesters, private shorefront landowners, and commercial fishermen boiled over in the summer of 2000, when Acadian Seaplants of Darmouth, Nova Scotia began advertising for seaweed harvesters to work in Maine, particularly in the Cobscook Bay area of Washington County. More than six hundred Washington County residents launched an unsuccessful petition effort to convince the Maine Department of Marine Resources (DMR) Commissioner George LaPointe to ban commercial harvesting in Cobscook Bay until research could determine what a large commercial harvest would do to the ecosystem of the bay. The majority of coastal property owners live in quiet acceptance of the fact that fishermen may legally use their shorefront property, but many resent the harvesting of seaweed growing on their land. These property owners feel that the loss of the vegetation detracts from their aesthetic enjoyment of the property and is an abrogation of their inherent right to exclude others from their land. Those of this persuasion argue that seaweed harvesters have no more right to remove seaweed from their intertidal zone than they would to harvest timber growing on their upland property. Harvesters, however, feel that they are entitled to profit from the resource since it grows in the sea, which is held in trust by the state as a resource common to all. Some argue that the gathering of seaweed falls within the definition of 2 ̆ 2 fishing 2 ̆ 2 for public trust doctrine purposes, and that the public is therefore allowed to traverse the intertidal zone in pursuit of seaplants. Harvesters can point to historical records showing that it has been gathered for centuries in Maine and elsewhere, and argue that they are, at the very least, entitled to an easement by prescription in certain localities. The pressures on Maine 2 ̆ 7 s seaweed resource are likely to increase. In addition to the local entrepreneurs that are gaining interest in the seaweed industry, commercial harvesting companies located in maritime Canada are looking to Maine as a plentiful source of seaweed. Acadian Seaplants has already begun hiring independent contractors to gather seaweed for export to processing plants in Canada. If the State of Maine deems it necessary to expand its cursory regulation of this resource, the time to do so is now. The competing interests in seaweed all stem from the question of ownership and the right to exclude. This article will analyze the property rights scheme in Maine to determine whether the resource is privately owned or open to public use, and whether, and how, the State of Maine could regulate its exploitation in order to ensure a sustainable harvest. These issues will be examined in light of Maine 2 ̆ 7 s existing legal framework including the public trust doctrine, the profit a prendre concept, pertinent case law, current agency regulatory regimes, and scholarly articles. To a significant degree, the legal arguments revolve around the characterization of seaweed as a certain type of property. The property characterization debate in turn is influenced by the physiology of the resource and the means by which it grows. Section II will familiarize the reader with the physiology and habitat of seaweeds, specifically those indigenous to the Maine coast. Section MI discusses the uses of seaweed both historically and in modern times. Section IV presents an overview of the public trust doctrine in Maine as a framework for the analysis in Section V of who exactly owns seaweeds off shore, on land, and in the intertidal zone. Section VI contemplates seaweed as a resource governed by the concept of profit a prendre. Maine 2 ̆ 7 s statutory regulation of the seaweed harvest is the subject of Section VII. Finally, this comment concludes that the property interests in seaweed vary with its location, but that live seaweeds growing in the intertidal zone should be considered the property of the upland owner...|$|E
