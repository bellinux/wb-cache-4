50|$|<b>Vreneli</b> is the {{informal}} {{name for a}} range of legal tender gold coins produced in Switzerland. The formal name is: Tête d'Helvetia (French), Helvetiakopf (German) or Helvetia Head (English). The coins were issued between 1897 and 1936, in 1947 and in 1949. All coins issued after 1936 are restrikes (legal tender ceased September 29, 1936).|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that some of the gold used for the coinage of <b>Vrenelis</b> originated from the Peruvian Madre de Dios region, where its current exploration is often undertaken using toxic materials and without formal concessions resulting, as a consequence, in environmental damage and health issues for the miners.|$|R

5000|$|A {{bullion coin}} is a coin struck from {{precious}} metal and kept as a {{store of value}} or an investment, rather than used in day-to-day commerce. The United Kingdom defines investment coins more specifically as coins that have been minted after 1800, have a purity of not less than 900 thousandths and are, or have been, legal tender in their country of origin. Under United States law, [...] "coins" [...] that fail the last of these requirements are not coins at all, and must be advertised as [...] "rounds" [...] instead. Bullion coins are usually available in both gold and silver, with the exceptions of the Krugerrand (note in 2017 the first silver Krugerrand was minted) and the Swiss <b>Vreneli</b> which are only available in gold. The American Eagle series is available in gold, silver and platinum, and the Canadian Maple Leaf series is available in gold, silver, platinum, and palladium.|$|E
5000|$|The 20 franc {{denomination}} {{with the}} aforementioned specifications (size and alloy and gold content) was first established by Napoleon for France in 1803. The denomination/specifications remained in usage until the First World War under {{what was known}} as the Latin Monetary League, the [...] "euro before the euro", so-to-speak. Switzerland constituted itself in Confederation in 1848. It adopted the Swiss Franc, and aligned its currency on the French franc in 1850. It joined the Latin Union in December 1865. Switzerland had Swiss 20 franc pieces, Spain had 20 peseta coins, Italy had 20 lira pieces, Belgium had 20 Belgian franc coins, and Greece had 20 drachmas coins all of which circulated and were accepted throughout Europe. Only for political reasons did the British and the German Empires refuse to follow this direction. Attempts were even taken to explore the unification of the European currency with the American dollar, which explains the extremely rare U.S. Stella carrying an unusual face value of $4, but which contained the same amount of gold as the 20F <b>Vreneli.</b> An earlier Swiss gold coin had been issued between 1883 and 1896.|$|E
