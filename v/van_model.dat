40|$|Soil water {{retention}} curves {{are an important}} parameter in soil hydrological modeling. These curves are usually represented by the <b>van</b> Genuchten <b>model.</b> Two approaches have previously been taken to predict curves across a field - interpolation of field measurements followed by estimation of the <b>van</b> Genuchten <b>model</b> parameters, or estimation of the parameters according to field measurements followed by interpolation of the estimated parameters. Neither approach is ideal as, due to their two-stage nature, they fail to properly track uncertainty from one stage to the next. In this paper we address this shortcoming through a spatial Bayesian hierarchical model that fits the <b>van</b> Genuchten <b>model</b> and predicts the fields of hydraulic parameters of the <b>van</b> Genuchten <b>model</b> as well as fields of the corresponding soil {{water retention}} curves. This approach expands the <b>van</b> Genuchten <b>model</b> to a hierarchical modeling framework. In this framework, soil properties and physical or environmental factors can be treated as covariates to add into the <b>van</b> Genuchten <b>model</b> hierarchically. Consequently, the effects of covariates on the hydraulic parameters of the <b>van</b> Genuchten <b>model</b> can be identified. In addition, our approach takes advantage of Bayesian analysis to account for uncertainty and overcome the shortcomings of other existing methods. The code used to fit these models are available as an appendix to this paper. We apply this approach to data surveyed from part of the alluvial plain of the river RhÔne near Yenne in Savoie, France. In this data analysis, we demonstrate how the inclusion of soil type or spatial effects can improve the <b>van</b> Genuchten <b>model</b> 2 ̆ 7 s predictions of soil water retention curves...|$|R

The model was jointly developed by LDV and Daewoo Motor, prior to Daewoo entering receivership in 2000, in a five-year, £500 million development programme. Following General Motors' acquisition of Daewoo, LDV secured the exclusive rights to the vehicle, purchased the tooling and moved it from Daewoo's plant in Lublin, Poland to the LDV site in Birmingham. A version of the Maxus is manufactured by GAZ.|$|E

The New Zealand version was mostly {{the same as the}} Japanese market five-door <b>van</b> <b>model,</b> with a cargo {{oriented}} bare-bones trim combined with the rather soft Japanese suspension settings and light, low-geared steering. Unlike the Japanese models, however, this low spec was coupled to the (carbureted) four-valve engine with [...] and a standard five-speed transmission. A three-speed automatic was also available.

5000|$|Further model range updates {{have been}} in {{parallel}} with the Minica. In June 1984 the range was updated, becoming the fourth generation U11/12 series (2WD/4WD). Although improvements were made to enhance the Minicab's commercial applications, the most noticeable changes were made to support personal leisure activities. Angular headlamps {{played an important role}} in the Minicab's styling, along with larger windows to improve visibility. A rear window wiper, electronic locking rear gate and power brakes were adopted. Mitsubishi offered fifteen front- and four-wheel drive <b>van</b> <b>model</b> variations and ten truck variations. This was also when the [...] "Bravo" [...] name was added to better equipped van models. This generation (collectively referred to as the U10) was built until November 1990, eventually reaching the U19 chassis code. In total, 707,348 fourth generation Minicabs were built.|$|E
