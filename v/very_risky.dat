5|$|Sing's marksmanship at Gallipoli saw him dubbed 'The Assassin' or 'The Murderer' by his comrades. He {{reportedly}} {{acquired the}} latter nickname {{due to his}} callous attitude towards the enemy. By early September 1915, he had taken 119 kills, according to Brigadier-General Granville Ryrie, commanding officer of the 2nd Australian Light Horse Brigade. Regimental records list Sing as having taken 150 confirmed kills, but on 23 October 1915, General William Birdwood, commander of ANZAC forces, issued an order complimenting him on his 201 unconfirmed kills. Historian Bob Courtney noted that an official kill was recorded only if the spotter saw the target fall. If the first shot missed the target, it was <b>very</b> <b>risky</b> {{to take a second}} shot, as this could give away the sniper team's position.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe was {{detailed}} {{to destroy}} Fighter Command before the planned invasion of Britain could take place. The OKL {{hoped that the}} destruction of the British fighter force would force the British to come to terms by air power alone and the <b>very</b> <b>risky</b> Operation Sea Lion would not be needed. The enormous numerical superiority of British naval forces over their German opponents made a crossing of the Channel very dangerous, even with air superiority. Furthermore, the aircraft losses of the spring campaign had weakened the Luftwaffe before the Battle of Britain, and it could not begin its campaign against Fighter Command immediately. It was forced to wait until it had reached acceptable levels before a main assault against the RAF could be made in August 1940.|$|E

The passage was <b>very</b> <b>risky</b> and accidents occurred, especially during high tides and storms. From 1754, a cable ferry crossed the 550m wide river. The cable lay above the waters and stretched obliquely to the current. In 1821, the cable ferry {{was replaced by a}} two-part ferry powered by a carousel of twelve horses. The horses set in motion gears which in turn powered a large paddle wheel. In good weather, the crossing time was improved to 30–45minutes, but in bad weather the trip remained uncertain.|$|E

5|$|On the 36th lap, Glock's right-rear {{suspension}} failed {{coming out}} of the final corner. He spun through 180 degrees before hitting the pit wall with a strong rearward impact, with debris flying across the track. The car, pointing the wrong way, rolled to a stop on the grass. A dazed Glock extracted himself before being treated at the medical centre. The safety car was deployed after the accident. When the pit lane opened on lap38, most drivers headed in, including all of the leaders except Hamilton. McLaren believed that Hamilton had enough fuel to stay out, the plan being for him to then rapidly pull away from his heavily-fuelled rivals, after the safety car went in. Hamilton needed to build up enough of a lead to rejoin still in first position, following his final pit stop. This would prove to be <b>very</b> <b>risky,</b> as Massa rejoined in fourth position, fuelled to the finish.|$|E
5|$|As the two armies {{returned}} to winter quarters, Francis I of France replaced Boutières with François de Vendôme, Count of Enghien, a prince with no experience commanding an army. Francis also sent additional {{troops to the}} Piedmont, including several hundred heavy cavalry, some companies of French infantry from Dauphiné and Languedoc, and a force of quasi-Swiss from Gruyères. In January 1544, Enghien laid siege to Carignano, which was defended by Imperial troops {{under the command of}} Pirro Colonna. The French were of the opinion that d'Avalos would be forced to attempt a relief of the besieged city, at which point he could be forced into a battle; but as such pitched battles were viewed as <b>very</b> <b>risky</b> undertakings, Enghien sent Blaise de Lasseran-Massencôme, seigneur de Montluc, to Paris to ask Francis for permission to fight one. Montluc apparently convinced Francis to give his assent—contingent on the agreement of Enghien's captains—over the objections of the Comte de St. Pol, who complained that a defeat would leave France exposed to an invasion by d'Avalos's troops at a time when Charles V and Henry VIII of England were expected to attack Picardy. Montluc, returning to Italy, brought with him nearly a hundred volunteers from among the young noblemen of the court, including Gaspard de Coligny.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{coaching}} styles {{of playing the}} game which leads to diversity in playing games against different opponents. Some coaches like to call <b>very</b> few <b>risky</b> offensive plays as they call mostly runs and low risk flat/lookin passes while other coaches like to call {{a significant number of}} risky and potentially rewarding long passes. Some coaches call defensive plays with less risk such as calling run or pass without moving players (i.e. without weakening one zone to strengthen another) while other coaches gamble more on defense. This diversity {{is considered to be a}} strong point of the game as a whole and is a testament to the realism of the game as this coaching style diversity also exists in the NFL.|$|R

Such decisions are made collectively, under a high degree of uncertainty and in non-emergency situations. The major problem in this context is indecision. In order to improve the decision-making process in practice, we need to characterize and analyze situations of decision-making under uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a new definition of uncertainty that takes human factors in its characterization into account. Then, we present a typology of uncertainty generators that helps us recognize and explore its causal factors. Additionally, we represent decision-making process in pharmaceutical R&D illustrating the role of different actors and their interactions in decision-making. This should help decision-makers adopt proactive practices instead of reactive ones...|$|R

According to the plan, the 7th corps had to stay at Hatvan until 5 April, than on 6th it had to reach Bag. The attack on the Austrian forces had to occur on 7 April at Gödöllő, from two directions, while the I. corps would advance to Kerepes, and fell on the Austrians from behind, preventing them to retreat towards Pest. The key of this <b>very</b> <b>risky</b> plan was that the Austrians would not discover the Hungarian movements until they completed the encirclement. This is why on the shoulder of the Hungarian commander of the VIIth Corps, András Gáspár, lied a very big responsibility to lead his troops in a way which will not betray the campaigns strategy. This meant that he had to make the enemy commander who faced him, to think that he is face to face with the whole Hungarian army, distracting his attention about the I., II., and III. Hungarian corps, which in the meanwhile, were advancing towards Gödöllő from South-East.

Welden finally understood that the Hungarian forces which were East from Pest (the II. corps led by Aulich), represented not an overwhelming force, which could have been a real treat to the imperials, if they retreated from their secured positions from Pest and the Danube Bend towards Komárom. This is why they could concentrate their forces around Komárom, to withstand against the main Hungarian forces preparing to attack them there. But Görgei hoped that his plan of misleading the Imperials was still working at that moment, this is why he ordered the crossing of the Danube, to attack the Austrian forces concentrated there, hoping to use his supposed numerical superiority to destroy them, and to encircle with this the forces which he thought were still in the Danube Bend.

One of the barriers and threats is the misuse and illegal distribution of alcoholic drinking, in particularly by reason of Indonesia is an archipelago island and its strategic location to international traffic. It is similar to Yogyakarta Municipality of which is not merely as a student city and cultural city, however it is also a tourist destination city, thus it is <b>very</b> <b>riskier</b> towards the misuse and distribution of illegal alcoholic drinking.

How are the efforts of Poltabes as legal enforcing apparatus in overwhelming the illegal distribution of alcoholic drinking in Yogyakarta municipality? 2. What barriers faced by Poltabes of Yogyakarta in overwhelming the illegal distribution or alcoholic drinking. The distribution of alcoholic drinking in area of Yogyakarta has very strong correlation to various kinds of criminal action, e. g. violence, extortion, robbing. The criminal action was conducted for fulfilling the necessities of those who has been addicted. In overwhelming the distribution of alcoholic drinking, it was conducted through two ways: 1.
