40|$|We present BVRI {{photometry}} of supernova 2011 fe in M 101 from 2. 9 to 182 {{days after}} the explosion. The light curves and color evolution show that SN 2011 fe belongs to the "normal" subset of type Ia supernovae, with Δ m_ 15 (B) = 1. 21 ± 0. 03 mag. After correcting for extinction and adopting a distance modulus of (m - M) = 29. 10 mag to M 101, we derive absolute magnitudes M_B = - 19. 21, M_V = - 19. 19, M_R = - 19. 18 and M_I = - 18. 94. We compare visual measurements of this event to our CCD photometry and find evidence for a systematic difference based on color.

40|$|We review {{some results}} of the past 12 years derived from optical and {{infrared}} photometry of Type Ia supernovae. A combination of optical and infrared photometry allows us to determine accurately the extinction {{along the line of}} sight. The resulting distance measurements are much more accurate than can be obtained from optical data alone. Type Ia supernovae are very nearly standard candles in the near-infrared. Accurate supernova distances, coupled with other observational data available at present, allow us to determine the matter density in the universe and lead to evidence for the existence of Dark Energy. We can now address some questions on the grandest scale such as, "What is the ultimate Fate of the universe?"Comment: 14 page, 9 figures, to be published in Journal of the American Assoc. of <b>Variable</b> <b>Star</b> <b>Observer...</b>|$|E
40|$|Variable {{stars are}} those whose {{brightness}} changes over time. Astronomers (amateurs and professionals alike) have played an integral role in making variable star observations, resulting in significant databases {{that are used}} to study these objects. These data can be used to ascertain physical processes taking place on the star, be it regular pulsations or material accreting onto the star in explosive, irregular events. My plan for the summer 2011 is to take pictures of variable stars using remote observatories, to learn observational techniques used with digital images, and to familiarize myself with image analysis tools that have come about since the last time I did variable star research in 1991. I plan to identify, observe, and analyze data from at least 5 different variable stars, to contribute these data to the American Association of <b>Variable</b> <b>Star</b> <b>Observer</b> data base, and ultimately lay the foundation for future BSU undergraduate research projects...|$|E

40|$|We review ways {{in which}} {{observations}} of the changing periods of pulsating variable stars {{can be used to}} detect and directly measure their evolution. We briefly describe the two main techniques of analysis [...] (O-C) analysis and wavelet analysis [...] and results for pulsating variable star types which are reasonably periodic: type I and II Cepheids, RR Lyrae stars, beta Cephei stars, and Mira stars. We comment briefly on delta Scuti stars and pulsating white dwarfs. For some of these variable star types, observations agree approximately with the predictions of evolutionary models, but there still exist significant areas of disagreement that challenge future models of stellar evolution. There may be a need, for instance, to include processes such as rotation, mass loss, and magnetic fields. There may also be non-evolutionary processes which are contributing to the period changes.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the relationship between the velocity parameters of SiO masers and the phase of the long period variable stars (LPVs) from which the masers originate. The SiO spectra from the v= 1, J= 1 - 0 (43. 122 GHz; hereafter J_ 1 → 0) and the v= 1, J= 2 - 1 (86. 2434 GHz; hereafter J_ 2 → 1) transitions have been measured using the Mopra Telescope of the Australia Telescope National Facility. One hundred twenty one sources have been observed including 47 LPVs contained in the American Association of <b>Variable</b> <b>Star</b> <b>Observer</b> Bulletin (2011). The epoch of maxima and the periods of the LPVs are well studied. This database of spectra allows for phase dependent comparisons and analysis not previously possible with such a large number of sources observed almost simultaneously in the two transitions over a time span of several years. The velocity centroids (VCs) and velocity ranges of emission (VRs) have been determined and compared for the two transitions as a function of phase. No obvious phase dependence has been determined for the VC or VR. The results of this analysis are compared with past observations and existing SiO maser theory...|$|E
40|$|Scientific Astrophotography is a {{work for}} those amateur astronomers looking for new challenges, once they have {{mastered}} visual observing and the basic imaging of various astronomical objects. It is a wonderful reference for scientifically-inclined observers who want to learn the fundamentals of astrophotography with a firm emphasis on the discipline of scientific imaging. This book is {{a wealth of information}} and a distillation of ideas presented by a diverse set of sources and based on the most recent techniques, equipment, and data available. It also includes numerous exercises for the reader, to maximize the success and minimize the frustration inherent in the pursuit of this specific craft. Scientific Astrophotography is perfect for any amateur astronomer who wants to go beyond just the process of making beautiful images and actually contribute to the science of astronomy! " [...] . Gerald Hubbell's new book, Scientific Astrophotography, is the perfect companion for anyone dipping their toe into the digital imaging realm for the first time.
