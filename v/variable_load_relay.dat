40|$|Abstract—Several Medium Access Control (MAC) {{protocols}} {{have been}} proposed for wireless sensor networks {{with the objective of}} minimizing energy consumption. For example, Sensor-MAC (S-MAC) was proposed to reduce energy consumption by introducing a duty cycle. Under <b>variable</b> traffic <b>load,</b> the fixed duty cycle of S-MAC results in energy loss due to idle listening along with higher latency and lower throughput compared to an adaptive duty cycle. Timeout-MAC (T-MAC) introduced such an adaptive duty cycle to handle <b>variable</b> traffic <b>loads.</b> However, nodes that do not take part in data exchange waste energy because of continuous renewal of their timeout values. In this paper we propose Advertisement MAC (ADV-MAC), a MAC protocol for wireless sensor networks that eliminates this energy waste by introducing the concept of advertising for data contention. ADV-MAC minimizes the energy lost in idle listening while maintaining an adaptive duty cycle to handle <b>variable</b> <b>loads.</b> Additionally, ADV-MAC enables energy efficient MAC-level multicasting. We provide detailed comparisons of the ADV-MAC protocol with S-MAC and T-MAC through extensive simulations. The simulation results show that ADV-MAC efficiently handles <b>variable</b> <b>load</b> situations and provides substantial gains over S-MAC and T-MAC in terms of energy (reduction of up to 45 %) while faring as well as T-MAC in terms of throughput and latency.

For classification of loads we must consider the Energy Conservation Measures (ECM) impact also. For calculation of energy saved it requires both base-line load value and post-installation value. In order to minimize cost and to increase efficiency, we use BFOA-based optimization approach together with the classification of loads. Bacterial foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA) has been widely accepted as a global optimization algorithm of current interest for distributed optimization and control. Minimizing the cost function guarantees minimum power generation through non-conventional source as well as storage capacity selection to supply the HVAC load.
