Mutation of proline to serine, to alanine, or to threonine in the well-conserved GPGR sequence in the V 3 region of the envelope glycoprotein was found in all these variants. This indicates the importance of amino acid sequences {{at the tip of}} the V 3 region for brain <b>cell</b> <b>tropism</b> of {{human immunodeficiency}} virus type 1. Most cells that are susceptible to {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) express CD 4 molecules on their surfaces (7, 14, 21, 31). However, not all cells expressing CD 4 molecules are infected by various HIV- 1 isolates (4, 5, 19). T-cell-line-tropic HIV- 1 and macrophage-tropic HIV- 1 have been well documented (12, 25). T-cell-line-tropic viruses scarcely infect macrophages, while macrophage-tropic viruses cannot infect T-cell-line cells.

We report here that GDVII virus adapted to growth in HS-deficient cells exhibited two amino acid substitutions (R 3126 L and N 1051 S) in the capsid {{and no longer}} used HS as a coreceptor. Infectious-virus yields in CHO cells were 25 -fold higher for the adapted virus than for the parental GDVII virus, and the neurovirulence of the adapted virus in intracerebrally inoculated mice was substantially attenuated.

40|$|Borna disease virus (BDV), the prototypic {{member of}} the Bornaviridae family within the order Mononegavirales, {{exhibits}} high neurotropism and provides an important and unique experimental model system for studying virus-cell interactions within the central nervous system.

Here, we provide evidence that BDV uses a clathrin-mediated, caveola-independent cell entry pathway. We also show that BDV G-mediated fusion takes place at an optimal pH of 6. 0 to 6. 2, corresponding to an early-endosome compartment. Consistent with this finding, BDV cell entry was Rab 5 dependent but Rab 7 independent and exhibited rapid fusion kinetics. Our results also uncovered a key role for microtubules in BDV cell entry, whereas the integrity and dynamics of actin cytoskeleton were not required for efficient cell entry of BDV...|$|R
40|$|Myxoma {{virus is}} a rabbit-specific {{poxvirus}} pathogen that also exhibits a unique tropism for human tumor cells and is dramatically oncolytic for human cancer xenografts. Most tumor cell lines tested are permissive for myxoma infection {{in a fashion}} intimately tied to the activation state of Akt kinase. A host range factor of myxoma virus, M-T 5, directly interacts with Akt and mediates myxoma <b>virus</b> tumor <b>cell</b> <b>tropism.</b> mTOR is a regulator of cell growth and metabolism downstream of Akt and is specifically inhibited by rapamycin. We report that treatment of nonpermissive human tumor cell lines, which normally restrict myxoma virus replication, with rapamycin dramatically increased virus tropism and spread in vitro. This increased myxoma replication is concomitant with global effects on mTOR signaling, specifically, an increase in Akt kinase. In contrast to the effects on human cancer cells, rapamycin does not increase myxoma virus replication in rabbit cell lines or permissive human tumor cell lines with constitutively active Akt. This indicates that rapamycin increases the oncolytic capacity of myxoma virus for human cancer cells by reconfiguring the internal cell signaling environment to one that is optimal for productive virus replication and suggests {{the possibility of a}} potentially therapeutic synergism between kinase signaling inhibitors and oncolytic poxviruses for cancer treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} {{and molecular}} mechanisms underpinning the unusually high virulence of highly pathogenic avian influenza H 5 N 1 viruses in mammalian species remains unknown. Here, we investigated if the <b>cell</b> <b>tropism</b> of H 5 N 1 virus is a determinant of enhanced virulence in mammalian species. We engineered H 5 N 1 <b>viruses</b> with restricted <b>cell</b> <b>tropism</b> through {{the exploitation of}} cell type-specific microRNA expression by incorporating microRNA target sites into the viral genome. Restriction of H 5 N 1 replication in endothelial cells via miR- 126 ameliorated disease symptoms, prevented systemic viral spread and limited mortality, despite showing similar levels of peak viral replication in the lungs as compared to control virus-infected mice. Similarly, restriction of H 5 N 1 replication in endothelial cells resulted in ameliorated disease symptoms and decreased viral spread in ferrets. Our studies demonstrate that H 5 N 1 infection of endothelial cells results in excessive production of cytokines and reduces endothelial barrier integrity in the lungs, which culminates in vascular leakage and viral pneumonia. Importantly, our studies suggest {{a need for a}} combinational therapy that targets viral components, suppresses host immune responses, and improves endothelial barrier integrity for the treatment of highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 virus infections...|$|R

In August 2006, we collected 19 free-living hatch-year Mallards that were positive for LPAI virus by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) in combined oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs. We investigated virus infection and associated lesions in the digestive and respiratory tracts by RRT-PCR, virus culture, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and histology. By RRT-PCR, 15 birds were positive in cloacal bursa, colon/cloaca, or both, and three were positive in lungs. Virus was isolated from eight birds and typed as H 2 N 3 (three birds), H 3 N 3 (two birds), H 3 N 8 (one bird), H 4 N 6 (one bird), and H?N 3 (one bird). By IHC, birds were positive in the cloacal bursa (eight birds), colon (three), cecum (two), or ileum (one). Cell types infected were superficial epithelial cells of the bursa and epithelial cells of the intestinal villi and, less commonly, mucosal glands. By histology, {{there was no evidence}} of lesions associated with LPAI virus infection. These results show that epithelia of the cloacal bursa and of the lower intestine are important sites of natural LPAI virus infection in free-living hatch-year Mallards. The lack of lesions associated with this infection suggests that there is a strong selection by LPAI virus to cause minimal virulence in this maintenance host species...|$|R

We have functionally analyzed the interactions of MV hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) proteins of vaccine (Edmonston) and wild-type (WTF) strains in different combinations in transfected cells. Cell-cell fusion occurs when both Edmonston F and H proteins are expressed in HeLa or Vero cells.

40|$|The {{high rates}} of RNA virus {{evolution}} are generally attributed to replication with error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. However, these long-term nucleotide substitution rates span three orders of magnitude and do not correlate well with mutation rates or selection pressures. This substitution rate variation {{may be explained by}} differences in virus ecology or intrinsic genomic properties. We generated nucleotide substitution rate estimates for mammalian RNA viruses and compiled comparable published rates, yielding a dataset of 118 substitution rates of structural genes from 51 different species, as well as 40 rates of non-structural genes from 28 species. Through ANCOVA analyses, we evaluated the relationships between these rates and four ecological factors: target cell, transmission route, host range, infection duration; and three genomic properties: genome length, genome sense, genome segmentation. Of these seven factors, we found target cells to be the only significant predictors of viral substitution rates, with <b>tropisms</b> for epithelial <b>cells</b> or neurons (P, 0. 0001) as the most significant predictors. Further, one-tailed t-tests showed that viruses primarily infecting epithelial cells evolve significantly faster than neurotropic viruses (P, 0. 0001 and P, 0. 001 for the structural genes and non-structural genes, respectively). These results provide strong evidence that the fastest evolving mammalian RNA <b>viruses</b> infect <b>cells</b> with the highest turnover rates: the highly proliferative epithelial cells.

40|$|Thirty-one {{different}} mutant {{forms of}} simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) were created {{with changes in}} the region of env corresponding to the V 3 domain of HIV- 1. Sixteen of these mutants had one amino acid change, 12 had two changes, two had three changes, and one had four changes in the SIVmac "V 3 " loop. The ability of the mutant viruses to replicate in CEMx 174 cells, rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and rhesus monkey alveolar macrophages was investigated. Ten of the mutant viruses replicated with approximately wild-type kinetics in all three cell types. Of the 31 mutants, 22 were able to replicate in {{one or more of the}} cell types. Thus, this region of SIVmac gp 120 is quite tolerant to change. Nine of the mutants replicated poorly or not at all in any of the cells tested. The lack of replication competence of some of the mutants was associated with inefficient proteolytic processing of the gp 160 precursor. Some mutations had dramatic differential effects in different cell types. For example, changing P to S at position 321 and M to I at position 325 drastically reduced replication in macrophages and CEMx 174 cells but had no effect on replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

HCMV encodes two alternative gH/gL complexes, gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/pUL (128, 130, 131 a) which both shape the broad <b>cell</b> <b>tropism</b> of HCMV.

Sialic acid receptors for both human and avian viruses, alpha- 2, 6 - and alpha- 2, 3 -linked sialic acids, respectively, were detected on the HAE cell surface, and their distribution accurately reflected that in human tracheobronchial tissue. Nonciliated cells present {{a higher proportion of}} alpha- 2, 6 -linked sialic acid, while ciliated cells possess both sialic acid linkages. Although we found that human influenza viruses infected both ciliated and nonciliated cell types {{in the first round of}} infection, recent human H 3 N 2 viruses infected a higher proportion of nonciliated cells in HAE than a 1968 pandemic-era human virus, which infected proportionally more ciliated cells. In contrast, avian influenza viruses exclusively infected ciliated cells. Although a broad-range neuraminidase abolished infection of HAE by human parainfluenza virus type 3, this treatment did not significantly affect infection by influenza viruses. All human viruses replicated efficiently in HAE, leading to accumulation of nascent virus released from the apical surface between 6 and 24 h postinfection with a low multiplicity of infection. Avian influenza A viruses also infected HAE, but spread was limited compared to that of human <b>viruses.</b> The nonciliated <b>cell</b> <b>tropism</b> of recent human H 3 N 2 viruses reflects a preference for the sialic acid linkages displayed on these cell types and suggests a drift in the receptor binding phenotype of the H 3 hemagglutinin protein as it evolves in humans away from its avian virus precursor...|$|R

40|$|Central {{nervous system}} (CNS) {{infection}} by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) {{is a model}} for studying virus-induced acute encephalomyelitis. MHV strains differ dramatically in their neurovirulence, or ability to cause morbidity or mortality secondary to CNS infection. One of the viral genes that is thought to influence neurovirulence is the spike (S) glycoprotein of MHV. In {{the absence of a}} molecular clone of the MHV genome, however, it has been difficult to address the role of individual viral genes in pathogenesis. ^ We have demonstrated that the spike gene is a major determinant of MHV neurovirulence using targeted RNA recombination. The recombinant virus S 4 R, containing the S gene of the highly neurovirulent MHV- 4 strain, exhibited a dramatically more neurovirulent phenotype than the isogenic recombinant SA 59 R, containing the S gene of the mildly neurovirulent MHV-A 59 strain. To more finely map the determinants of neurovirulence within the spike, we generated isogenic recombinant viruses containing various MHV- 4 /MHV-A 59 chimeric spike genes, and studied their phenotypes. All of the chimeric spike gene recombinants exhibited efficient replication in cell culture, yet many were severely attenuated for replication and for virulence in vivo. Thus it appeared that the interactions of multiple regions of the MHV- 4 spike were necessary for efficient infection of and virulence in the murine CNS. To further elucidate the role of spike in MHV neurovirulence, we studied the neuropathological differences between S 4 R and SA 59 R infection. We characterized the regional <b>virus</b> distribution, <b>cell</b> <b>tropism,</b> number of infected cells, and inflammatory infiltrates in the CNS. We found that the high neurovirulence conferred by the MHV- 4 spike relative to the MHV-A 59 spike correlated with an increased number of viral antigen positive neurons and glia and an increased number of inflammatory cells, including CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells, in the brain. Furthermore, infection of RAG 1 −/− mice suggested that the lymphocytic response to infection also contributes to the high neurovirulence conferred by the MHV- 4 spike. ^ These results demonstrate that the spike is a major determinant of MHV neurovirulence, identify features of neurovirulence conferred exclusively by the spike glycoprotein, and further our understanding {{of the role of the}} spike in neurovirulence. ...|$|R

To identify features of {{central nervous system}} (CNS) infection that correlate with neurovirulence, we compared two neurovirulent MuLV, Fr 98 and Fr 98 /SE, with a nonneurovirulent MuLV, Fr 54. All three viruses utilize the polytropic receptor and are coisogenic, each containing a different envelope gene within a common genetic background. Both Fr 98 and Fr 98 /SE induce a clinical neurologic disease characterized by hyperexcitability and ataxia yet differ in incubation period, 16 to 30 and 30 to 60 days, respectively. Fr 54 infects the CNS but fails to induce clinical signs of neurologic disease. In this study, we compared the histopathology, regional <b>virus</b> distribution, and <b>cell</b> <b>tropism</b> in the brain, {{as well as the}} relative CNS viral burdens. All three viruses induced similar histopathologic effects, characterized by intense reactive astrogliosis and microglial activation associated with minimal vacuolar degeneration. The infected target <b>cells</b> for each <b>virus</b> consisted primarily of endothelial and microglial cells, with rare oligodendrocytes. Infection localized predominantly in white matter tracts of the cerebellum, internal capsule, and corpus callosum. The only feature that correlated with relative neurovirulence was viral burden as measured by both viral CA protein expression in cerebellar homogenates and quantification of infected cells. Interestingly, Fr 54 (nonneurovirulent) and Fr 98 /SE (slow disease) had similar viral burdens at 3 weeks postinoculation, suggesting that they entered the brain with comparable efficiencies. However, spread of Fr 98 /SE within the brain thereafter exceeded that of Fr 54, reaching levels of viral burden comparable to that seen for Fr 98 (rapid disease) at 3 weeks. These results suggest that the determinants of neurovirulence in the envelope gene may influence the efficiency of virus spread within the brain and that a critical number of infected cells may be required for induction of clinical neurologic disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{intracellular}} bacterium Wolbachia pipientis {{is widely}} spread amongst insect populations, like Drosophila. Recently, Wolbachia infection {{was found to}} reduce virus-induced mortality and lower the viral load in dually infected Drosophila melanogaster. Unravelling the mechanism behind this Wolbachia-induced survival might further elucidate the high prevalence of Wolbachia amongst insect species; but above all it might give new insights in antiviral immunity of insects that spread vector-borne diseases and it might help to better understand antiviral immunity in general. Even thought Wolbachia infection does not induce a clear phenotype in D. melanogaster, it does result in profound changes in transcription, for example of signaling molecules in the Toll, Imd, and JNK pathways. In addition, heat shock proteins, autophagy, and other processes – possibly induced by secreted Ankyrin-repeat-containing proteins of Wolbachia – might be active during Wolbachia infection. Wolbachia was shown to protect against positive sense (+) single-stranded RNA viruses from different families that replicate in association with cellular membranes. These viruses normally promote antiviral RNA interference, Imd and Jak/STAT signaling, autophagy, phagocytosis, and/or apoptosis in Drosophila. Remarkably, Wolbachia does not protect against infection with a double-stranded DNA virus. Unfortunately, {{little is known about}} the reactions induced upon double-stranded DNA-virus infection. All together, Wolbachia might protect Drosophila by priming the antiviral immune response, for example by activating Imd and Toll signaling. Importantly, all examined RNA <b>viruses</b> show overlapping <b>cell</b> <b>tropism</b> with Wolbachia, thus Wolbachia might also directly affect viral replication.

FIV- 14 replication was productive in both CrFK cells and PBMC. Interestingly, all three molecular clones replicated with similar efficiencies in primary feline monocyte-derived macrophages. In vivo, FIV-pF 34 proved least efficient for establishing persistent infection, and proviral DNA when detectable, was localized predominately to nonlymphoid cell populations (macrophages). FIV-pPPR proved most efficient for induction of a persistent viremia in vivo, and proviral DNA was localized predominately in CD 4 + and CD 8 + lymphocyte subsets. FIV- 14 inoculation of cats resulted in an infection characterized by seroconversion and localization of proviral DNA in CD 4 + lymphocytes only. Results of this study on diverse FIV molecular clones revealed that in vitro replication efficiency of an FIV isolate in PBMC directly correlated with replication efficiency in vivo, whereas proficiency for replication in macrophages in vitro was not predictive for replication potential in vivo. Also, infection of both CD 4 + and CD 8 + lymphocyte subsets was associated with higher virus load in vivo. Results of the studies on these three FIV clones, which exhibited differential <b>cell</b> <b>tropism,</b> indicated a correlation between in vitro and in vivo <b>cell</b> <b>tropism</b> and <b>virus</b> replication...|$|R
40|$|The V 3 loop {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 is both a determinant of viral <b>cell</b> <b>tropism</b> and a target for neutralizing antibodies. This relationship was investigated. Selection of a dual-tropic (T <b>cells</b> and macrophages) <b>virus</b> to replicate in CD 4 + brain cells results in loss of macrophage tropism and of neutralization by an anti-V 3 loop monoclonal antibody. Moreover, selection of the brain-selected variant to escape from V 3 loop-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies results in the reduction or loss of brain <b>cell</b> <b>tropism</b> and the reacquisition of macrophage tropism. These data may indicate that the antigenic diversification of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 apparent after seroconversion can be selected either by immune responses or by colonization of new cell types...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV), {{a member}} of the Orthomyxoviridae family, infects and causes disease in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Previous studies have shown Atlantic salmon endothelial cells to be the primary targets of ISAV infection. However, it is not known if cells other than endothelial cells play a role in ISAV tropism. To further assess <b>cell</b> <b>tropism,</b> we {{examined}} ISAV infection of Atlantic salmon gill epithelial cells in vivo and in vitro. We demonstrated the susceptibility of epithelial cells to ISAV infection. On comparison of primary gill epithelial cell cultures with ISAV permissive fish cell cultures, we found the virus yield in primary gill epithelial cells to be comparable with that of salmon head kidney (SHK) - 1 cells, but lower than TO or Atlantic salmon kidney (ASK) -II cells. Light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the primary gill cells possessed characteristics consistent with epithelial <b>cells.</b> <b>Virus</b> histochemistry showed that gill epithelial cells expressed 4 - O -acetylated sialic acid which is recognized as the ISAV receptor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of ISAV infection in Atlantic salmon primary gill epithelial cells. This study thus broadens our understanding of <b>cell</b> <b>tropism</b> and transmission of ISAV in Atlantic salmon. </p...|$|R
40|$|In the 10 {{years since}} AIDS was first identified, {{knowledge}} of the causative agent, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), has advanced remarkably. Molecular biological analysis has had {{a greater impact on}} the investigation of HIV and AIDS than on that of any other disease. Unfortunately, the vast amount of material published on this subject has still not resulted in a thorough understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS. Undoubtedly, {{part of the reason for}} the complexity of this disease stems from the ability of HIV to infect a large number of different cell types. To comprehend the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AIDS, it is of great importance to understand the factors that control the <b>cell</b> <b>tropism</b> of the <b>virus.</b> In this review, we describe the known factors involved in the determination of the <b>cell</b> <b>tropism</b> of retroviruses and the ways by which molecular biological analysis of HIV has revealed the nature of the processes involved in control of the tropism of the <b>virus</b> for various <b>cell</b> types. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the etiologic agent of AIDS [1, 2]. Two closely related and similar viruses, HIV- 1 and HIV- 2, are involved in human disease. However, we will concentrate on HIV- 1 in this review since it has re...|$|R

40|$|Using {{recombinant}} and mutant viruses generated {{between two}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 isolates that display differences in <b>cell</b> <b>tropism</b> and sensitivity to soluble CD 4 neutralization, we show that these two properties of the virus are regulated by different mechanisms. Whereas there is an association between V 3 loop conformation and a particular cellular tropism, soluble CD 4 neutralization sensitivity appears {{to be determined by}} amino acid differences in the C 2 domain of the envelope gp 120 that modulate the stability of gp 120 -gp 41 association. Our findings further illustrate the importance of functional interactions among different regions of the envelope gp 120 in regulating the biological phenotypes of human immunodeficiency virus and suggest that additional probing of the V 3 loop with monoclonal antibodies may identify specific structural features of this loop that determine <b>cell</b> <b>tropism...</b>|$|R
40|$|The feline {{and human}} {{immunodeficiency}} viruses (FIV and HIV) target helper T cells selectively, {{and in doing}} so they induce a profound immune dysfunction. The primary determinant of HIV <b>cell</b> <b>tropism</b> is the expression pattern of the primary viral receptor CD 4 and co-receptor(s), such as CXCR 4 and CCR 5. FIV employs a distinct strategy to target helper T cells; a high affinity interaction with CD 134 (OX 40) is followed by binding of the virus to its sole co-receptor, CXCR 4. Recent studies have demonstrated that the way in which FIV interacts with its primary receptor, CD 134, alters as infection progresses, changing the <b>cell</b> <b>tropism</b> of the <b>virus.</b> This review examines the contribution of the virus–receptor interaction to replication in vivo as well as the significance of these findings to the development of vaccines and therapeutics...|$|R
