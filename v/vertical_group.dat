The <b>vertical</b> <b>group</b> or keiretsu structure was first identified and studied in the auto and electronics industries, where it is most strongly marked, but it characterizes virtually all sectors, service industries as well as manufacturing. Large industrial vertical keiretsu are composed of subsidiaries engaged in three distinct types of activities (manufacturing, marketing, and quasirelated business). The coordination and control systems are built on the flows of products, financial resources, information and technology, and people across formal company boundaries, with the parent firm controlling the key flows.

40|$|Horizontally periodic, {{vertically}} localized internal wavepackets evolve nonlinearly due only to {{interactions between}} the waves and their wave-induced mean flow. The corresponding weakly nonlinear equation that describes {{the evolution of the}} amplitude envelope before the onset of parametric subharmonic instability is examined. The results are compared with fully nonlinear numerical simulations and are shown to lie in excellent agreement for over 15 buoyancy periods. Analysis of the equation shows that the evolution is modulationally unstable if the wave frequency exceeds that of waves with the fastest <b>vertical</b> <b>group</b> speed and if the amplitude is sufficiently large. Waves that move close to the fastest <b>vertical</b> <b>group</b> speed are unstable even if their relative amplitude is {{a tiny fraction of the}} inverse relative vertical extent of the wavepacket. At late times in the evolution of an unstable wavepacket third-order dispersion terms become non-negligible and act in conjunction with weakly nonlinear effects to retard the vertical advance of the wavepacket as a whole. 1...|$|E
40|$|The linear and weakly {{non-linear}} {{limits of}} two-dimensional gravity waves in an incompressible, inviscid and stably stratified atmosphere are studied. The linear results indicate {{the growth of}} waves propagating upward leading to {{the breakdown of the}} linear theory. The three-wave resonant interaction theory indicates an energy cascade from a vertically propagating wave (primary wave) to waves having smaller absolute values of Doppler shifted frequency ((OMEGA)). When the non-dimensional parameter(DIAGRAM, TABLE OR GRAPHIC OMITTED [...] . PLEASE SEE DAI) is in the range " 1 to about 0. 8 " (N being the Brunt-Vaisala frequency), the energy of the primary wave is transferred to bands of small amplitude waves. The triads in these bands include a member with the same <b>vertical</b> <b>group</b> velocity as the primary wave while other triads contain a member with larger <b>vertical</b> <b>group</b> velocity. The band widths approach zero as the primary wave amplitude is reduced.

30|$|The GVCA method {{based on}} {{horizontally}} grouped training set is {{as shown in}} Algorithm  2. Meanwhile, regarding the problem of too high eigenvector dimension of training set, a feasible approach is to group the features, i.e., to randomly group a feature set into several non-intersecting subsets, and project the originally integral training set into those feature sets, thereby composing several new grouped training sets. After that, the original VCA method is used to obtain vanishing component polynomial respectively, and finally, the vanishing component polynomial in multiple grouped training sets is combined into the vanishing component polynomial in an integral training set. This approach is called the <b>vertical</b> <b>grouping</b> method. The GVCA method based on vertically grouping training sets is as shown in Algorithm  3. Furthermore, to handle both problems of over-scaled training set and too high eigenvector dimension, the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>grouping</b> approaches can be applied simultaneously.|$|R

40|$|When {{tobacco hornworm}} (Manduca sexta) larvae burrow {{underground}} (25 - 30 cm) to pupate, they reorient {{themselves to a}} relatively horizontal position indicating an ability to sense gravity. To evaluate their sensitivity to gravitational environment during metamorphosis, Manduca (pharate adults) were placed in a vertical (head-up) position. Distinct morphological changes, each one reflecting ensuing phases, were used to follow adult development. Five days after pupation, the <b>vertical</b> <b>group</b> showed accelerated (P less than 0. 05) development and were nearly 4 phases ahead (P less than 0. 0001) after 10 days. Differences in development in the <b>vertical</b> <b>group</b> were characterized further by increased (7 - 48 %) hemolymph concentrations of 13 amino acids, but a decrease in cys and pro and no change in arg, his, met and val (trp, undetectable). Decreased (36 %) turnover of injected H- 3 - phenylalanine suggested slower utilization of amino acids contributed, at least partly, to the increased concentrations. Vertically-oriented Manduca also exhibited a greater (20 %, P less than 0. 001) protein content in their flight muscles {{near the end of}} development. Analysis of hemolymph sugar levels showed a redistribution of sugars from the monosaccharide glucose to the disaccharide trehalose. Since injection of 20 -hydroxyecdysone decreased (49 %) turnover of H- 3 - phenylalanine in pharate adults and since ecdysteroids are known to increase flight muscle size and control adult development, these results are consistent with our measuring a greater (+ 80 %, P less than 0. 05) ecdysteroid titer in the vertically-oriented insects. These results suggest that gravity environment influences ecdysone output by the pharate adult. When we evaluated hemolymph flow in the head-up and control positions, we found that injected C- 14 -inulin was distributed somewhat more rapidly in the head-up group irrespective of the sight of injection (head or abdomen) likely because in the head-up position flow of the hemolymph is facilitated throughout the animal. Other experiments showed that an intact prothoracic gland is needed for the response. Hence vertical, head-up orientation affects release of ecdysone from the prothoracic gland...|$|E
40|$|Although {{many factors}} may {{influence}} {{the choice of the}} operative incision, physiologic safety in terms of the degree of postoperative hypoxemia should be considered. No data currently exist to delineate in markedly obese patients the effect of the operative incision on the extent or duration of this hypoxemia. Fifty-four consecutive patients of both sexes, scheduled for elective jejunoileal bypass for morbid exogenous obesity, were studied. In 23 patients the operation was performed through a transverse incision and in 25 patients through a vertical incision. In 6 patients, cholecystectomy was also performed in addition to the jejunoileal bypass. Postoperatively there was a significant fall in PAO 2 both in the transverse and vertical incision groups and this continued through day 4. On day 5 statistically significant hypoxemia was present only in the vertical incision group. In addition, the decrease in PaO 2 was significantly greater on days 4 and 5 in the <b>vertical</b> <b>group</b> than in the transverse group. On days 2 and 3 again the mean decrease in PaO 2 was greater in the <b>vertical</b> <b>group</b> but this was not statistically significant. The effect of added cholecystectomy on PaO 2 was studied in 6 women with midline incisions. The results were compared with 6 subjects who had small bowel bypass without cholecystectomy and who were matched for incision, age weight, girth/height ratio, weight/height ratio, smoking habit, and percentage of predicted ERV. In both groups there was a significant fall of PAO 2 from day 1 through day 4, but {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups. Although the numbers studied were small, these limited results would suggest that the type of incesion rather than the intraoperative procedure is the important factor in determining postoperative PAO 2 changes. These studies also suggest that in patients with an increased potential for postoperative hypoxemia (i. e., markedly obese), the transverse abdominal approach shoudl always be seriously considered...|$|E

For the wave parameters studied here, the background wind variation has a much stronger influence on the ray path and changes in wave characteristics than does the temperature variation. The temporal variation of the tidal component of the wind changes the observed frequency, sometimes substantially, while leaving the intrinsic frequency unaltered. It also renders temporary any critical levels {{that occur in the}} tidal region. Different starting times for the rays relative to the tidal phase provide different propagation environments, so that the temporary critical levels appear at different heights.

40|$|Abstract—The {{proliferation}} of heterogeneous wireless networks and devices with multiple wireless link-layer technologies have {{called attention to}} the development of efficient vertical handover policies. Research on providing efficient vertical handover in-cludes either the proposal of novel solutions or adaptations into existing horizontal handover schemes. In this work, we propose a policy for Group Vertical Handover (GVHO) attempts. We apply such a policy to an existing GVHO scheme, which handles <b>vertical</b> <b>group</b> handover based on a threshold that limits handover blocking probability. Performance is evaluated through simula-tion under several scenarios. To provide more realistic situations, we consider channel holding time in our studies. In addition, we study the fraction of blocked nodes and we vary threshold values for blocking probability. We compare our solution to that of the studied GVHO scheme. Results show that our solution reduces the handover latency and the fraction of blocked nodes while maintaining the handover blocking probability under a predefined threshold. In particular, latency is reduced from 11 % to 51. 5 % in some of the scenarios studied. Keywords-GVHO; handover; policy of attempts. I...|$|E
