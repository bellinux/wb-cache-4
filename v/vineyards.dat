The Grand Cru rated <b>vineyards</b> received 100 percent rating which entitled the grower to 100% of the price. Premier Crus were <b>vineyards</b> with 90–99% ratings while Deuxième Crus received 80–89% ratings.|$|E

5|$|When <b>vineyards</b> in the {{south-west}} Cape started letting weeds grow between vines {{to conserve}} moisture, around 1956, the Cape sparrow moved in.

5|$|Despite {{the general}} {{reputation}} as a mass producer and a consensus that the region {{is in the midst}} of an economic crisis, parts of the Languedoc wine industry are experiencing commercial success due to outside investment and an increased focus on quality. Sales have been improved by many <b>vineyards</b> that concentrate on creating a good brand name rather than relying on the sometimes infamous regional designations. Some <b>vineyards</b> have adopted the youngest batch of AOC classifications developed in the late 1990s, while other <b>vineyards</b> eschew designated blends entirely and are instead shifting toward bottling single varietal wines, a practice increasingly demanded by consumers in the large New World wine market.|$|E
5|$|The first grapevines {{were brought}} to Peru shortly after its conquest by Spain in the 16th century. Spanish chroniclers from the time note the first {{winemaking}} in South America {{took place in the}} hacienda Marcahuasi of Cuzco. The largest and most prominent <b>vineyards</b> of the 16th and 17th century Americas were established in the Ica valley of south-central Peru. In the 1540s, Bartolomé de Terrazas and Francisco de Carabantes planted <b>vineyards</b> in Peru.

5|$|The {{history of}} Languedoc wines {{can be traced}} to the first <b>vineyards</b> planted along the coast near Narbonne by the early Greeks in the fifth century BC.

5|$|After an {{extensive}} review of vineyard conditions {{in and around}} the existing Champagne region, INAO presented a proposal to revise the region on March 14, 2008. The proposal was prepared by a group of five experts in the subjects of history, geography, geology, phytosociology and agronomy, working from 2005. The proposal means expanding the region to cover <b>vineyards</b> in 357 rather than 319 villages. This is to be achieved by adding <b>vineyards</b> in forty villages while simultaneously removing two villages in the Marne départment that were included in the 1927 regulations, Germaine and Orbais-l'Abbaye.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the climate}} and land of Palestine, {{where most of the}} Bible takes place, were well-suited to growing grapes, and the wine that the <b>vineyards</b> {{produced}} was a valued commodity in ancient times, both for local consumption and for its value in trade. Trade with Egypt was quite extensive. Jews were a wine-drinking culture well before the foundation of Rome. Vintage wines were found in the tomb of King Scorpion in Hierakonpolis. Archaeological evidence suggests that Semitic predecessors were thought to be responsible for the vintages that were found in the tomb. <b>Vineyards</b> were protected from robbers and animals by walls, hedges, and manned watchtowers.|$|E

5|$|In California, {{the main}} stylistic {{difference}} in Cabernet Sauvignon is between hillside/mountain <b>vineyards</b> {{and those on}} flatter terrain like valley floors or {{some areas of the}} Central Valley. In Napa, the hillside <b>vineyards</b> of Diamond Mountain District, Howell Mountain, Mt. Veeder, Spring Mountain District have thinner, less fertile soils which produces smaller berries with more intense flavors, reminiscent of Bordeaux wines that require years of aging to mature. The yields are also much lower, typically in the range of 1–2 tons per acre in contrast to the 4–8 tons that can be produced in the more fertile valley floors. Wines produced from mountainside <b>vineyards</b> tend to be characterized by deep inky colors and strong berry aromas. Throughout California there are many wine regions that have the potential to grow Cabernet Sauvignon to full ripeness and produce fruity, full-bodied wines with alcohol levels regularly above the Bordeaux average of 12–13%—often in excess of 14%.|$|E
5|$|Oregon {{produces}} wine on a {{much smaller}} scale than the California wine industry. Oregon's leading producer, King Estate, ships only 401,400 cases per year and most produce under 35,000cases. The state features many small wineries that produce less than 5,000cases per year. In contrast, E & J Gallo, the United States' largest winery with more than 50 different brands including Washington's Columbia Winery and Covey Run holds 22.8% share of the US market. The majority of wineries in the state operate their own <b>vineyards,</b> although some purchase grapes on the market. Oregon contains {{a significant number of}} independent <b>vineyards.</b>|$|E

5|$|This {{included}} the planting of Pinot noir grapes in the Willamette Valley, a region long thought {{too cold to}} be suitable for viticulture. In the 1970s, more out-of-state winemakers migrated {{to the state and}} started to organize as an industry. The state's land use laws had prevented rural hillsides from being turned into housing tracts, preserving a significant amount of land suitable for <b>vineyards.</b> In 1979, The Eyrie <b>Vineyards</b> entered a 1975 Pinot noir in the Wine Olympics; the wine was rated among the top Pinots in the world, thus gaining the region its first international recognition.|$|E

5|$|Bute died in 1900 and his widow, the Marchioness, {{was given}} a life {{interest}} in Castell Coch; during her mourning, she and her daughter, Lady Margaret Crichton-Stuart, occupied the castle and made occasional visits thereafter. Production in the castle <b>vineyards</b> ceased during the First World War due to the shortages of the sugar needed for the fermentation process, and in 1920 the <b>vineyards</b> were uprooted. John, the 4th Marquess, acquired the castle in 1932 but made little use of it. He also began to reduce the family's investments in South Wales. The coal trade had declined after 1918 and industry had suffered during the depression of the 1920s; by 1938, {{the great majority of}} the family interests, including the coal mines and docks, had been sold off or nationalised.|$|E
5|$|By 1930, {{the wine}} {{industry}} had weakened {{due to the}} Great Depression and Prohibition. Many <b>vineyards</b> that survived by supplying the home market were located in California's Central Valley, a non-optimal environment for growing quality Zinfandel. Thus, the end of Prohibition left a shortage of quality wine grapes, and Zinfandel sank into obscurity as most was blended into undistinguished fortified wines. However, some producers remained interested in making single varietal red wines.|$|E
