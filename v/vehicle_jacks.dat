40|$|In many {{developing}} countries, particularly Nigeria,the {{high cost of}} production of a vehicle jack and the prevailing economic situation has made the commercial production of <b>vehicle</b> <b>jacks</b> difficult. Thus, {{the development of an}} appropriate technology for a vehicle jackwould be of vital utility to vehicle users. This paper presents the design and construction of a low-price, simple mechanical jack with wedge mechanism to provide a lift of about 160 mm with a self-locking capability for both small- and medium-sized vehicles. The design calculationsinvolve the evaluation of applied force required, the screw shaft design, and the lift head design analysis. The fabricated jack was tested on some small and medium vehicles, which resulted in a good lift without any pre-manual lifting. The jack weighs about 4 kg and costs about N 1000 per unit...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} project 'Controllability of Road Vehicles at the Limits of Tyre Adhesion' (CROVLA) {{was established to}} investigate how tyre and chassis properties contribute to the handling characteristics and stability of vehicles operating at or near to the limit condition. The project involved the Department of Transport, SP Tyres UK Limited, Jaguar Cars and Cranfield University. An extensive proving ground test program of typical limit handling tests provided characteristic driver input and vehicle response data {{for a variety of}} vehicle configurations. The test data analysis was based on the concept of correlation. Cross- correlation coefficients and average response time delays were obtained for various pairs of quantities, namely steering angle and torque for the input and yaw rate and lateral acceleration for the response. The predictability of the vehicle response was evaluated by the rate by which the correlation coefficients change with severity. Analogous to the proving ground work, vehicle dynamics simulations were carried out. Two programs were employed to study the steady state performance and the transient limit handling behaviour. The `Steady State Cornering Model' was used to confirm some basic suspension design rules established for optimising the lateral adhesion of a suspension design. The importance of controlling camber and <b>vehicle</b> <b>jacking</b> by an appropriate suspension design was identified. A detailed vehicle model was built-up using the simulation code AUTOSIM. After validating the model against proving ground data, some parametric studies were conducted to quantify the effects of suspension and tyre properties on the transient limit response behaviour. Proving ground and simulation results suggest that response time lags and cross- correlation coefficients in combination with other handling parameters can be used as objective quality measures. The results quantified to what extent tyre and chassis modifications change the limit handling behaviour...|$|R

50|$|A {{jockey wheel}} is a {{retractable}} adjustable-height wheel {{used on the}} front of trailers with either a single axle (two running wheels) or more close-coupled axles at or near the centre of gravity whereby without additional support, the trailer would not remain 'level'. The jockey wheel is situated close to the towing hitch and has a built-in screw jack to enable the trailer nose to be lifted over the tow ball of a car or other powered <b>vehicle.</b> The screw <b>jack</b> can then be used to gently lower the trailer nose onto the tow ball. Once securely attached to the towing vehicle, the jockey wheel's jacking action is fully retracted for stowage.

40|$|Most modern {{vehicles}} have {{protective covers}} such as skid plates and belly pans {{that cover the}} majority of the undercarriage. Therefore, specific jack points exist on each corner of these <b>vehicles.</b> A <b>jack</b> can be placed on these points to safely lift the vehicle up without damaging any plastic covers. However, this poses a problem for the DIY mechanic. The jack point usually does not leave enough room for a jack and a jack stand. The objective of the Automotive Hub Stand Design project was to design an affordable alternative to the traditional jack stand that can be mounted directly to the hub of the vehicle using the factory lug pattern and nuts. The goal was to create a universal system that could be used on any vehicle. This was accomplished by utilizing an interchangeable Hub Plate Member that can be manufactured for specific vehicles. For the scope of this project, one hub plate member that incorporates both Subaru and Audi vehicles was manufactured. Column buckling and shear force calculations as well as material strength analysis was completed for this project. The Automotive Hub Stand was modeled using Solidworks and manufactured out of 6061 Aluminum. All of the parts were completed with the resources available at CWU’s machine and welding shops. The Hub Stand was designed to hold up 1. 5 tons and cost under $ 300. The project was a success in regards to the set requirements in cost, usability (ease of use), dimensions and load/capacity requirements...|$|R
5000|$|Pep Love, {{also known}} as Pep Lava, is a Black American rapper from Oakland, CA by way of Jackson, MS. He was first heard on the b-side of Del the Funky Homosapien’s Wrong Place at the Wrong Time\ Elektra Records single release on a song titled Undisputed Champs. This obscure, mythical rap classic also {{featured}} Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest. Pep’s rapid fire - rhythm wave riding - metrenome sex style was honed from 90’s Hip Hop {{as a member of}} the well known and well regarded Hieroglyphics rap crew. [...] Pep Love’s debut solo album, Ascension, was a Hip Hop journey into the mind and soul. This, along with his outstanding vocal contributions and concepts on Hieroglyphics’ album's Third Eye Vision and Full Circle, established Pep’s signature mark as a rap artist early on in his career. Pep returned in full force in 2012 with the Rigmarole LP. Hip Hop My Friend, the lead single from the Rigmarole album, was widely praised by hardcore hip hop heads and can be heard playing on the radio of <b>jacked</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the video game Watch Dogs 2. Since Rigmarole Pep has been back with various music releases including Fallacy Fantasy; a collaborative effort with Hieroglyphics comrade Opio as First Light. Pep’s Dolla Daily EP in 2014 showcased his skill as a beatmaker in addition to his already renowned abilities as a fly emcee. He also released a few loosies like the digital 12” Prayful’ Hate, an introspective reflection of self loathing, and a couple of others that you can find on Bandcamp. Now, he returns with the Fly Philosophy EP. Mostly self produced, this musical outing is merely the tip of the iceberg that chipped off of the glacier as Pep Love attempts to redefine the standard of dope Hip Hop. Along with the Wax Poetic day party events and the Hip Hop Needle Drop nightlife series his recent efforts make it abundantly clear that Pep Love has no plans of letting up until his rap dreams are made manifest.|$|R
