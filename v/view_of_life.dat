5|$|In {{his final}} period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and {{completed}} three more major plays: Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest, {{as well as}} the collaboration, Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors. Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> on Shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day. Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen, probably with John Fletcher.|$|E

5|$|Just as the Eiffel Tower {{is often}} used in popular culture to {{immediately}} locate a scene in Paris, France, the Tokyo Tower {{is often used}} in the same way for Tokyo. It is used in anime and manga such as Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, Magic Knight Rayearth, Please Save My Earth, Cardcaptor Sakura, Digimon, Detective Conan, Sailor Moon, and Death Note. The tower is also frequently used in the Japanese kaiju (giant monster) film genre. It has been the location of the climactic 'battles' between Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera and King Kong (King Kong Escapes) wherein it is frequently destroyed and rebuilt. Based on the popular manga series by Ryōhei Saigan, the 2005 film Always Sanchōme no Yūhi was a nostalgic <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in the neighbourhoods under the construction of the Tokyo Tower.|$|E

5|$|Joel is {{voiced by}} veteran voice actor Troy Baker, while Ellie is voiced by actress Ashley Johnson. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology; approximately 85% of the game's animations were recorded using motion capture, with remaining audio elements recorded {{later in a}} studio. Though the team quickly felt that Johnson fit the role of Ellie, they spent more time selecting the actor of Joel, as the chemistry between the two characters was imperative to the game. After Baker and Johnson played alongside each other, the team realised that the former perfectly fit the role of Joel, despite the actor's young age. Druckmann attributed Baker's voice and movement to the team's choice of casting him. Baker and Johnson contributed greatly {{to the development of}} the characters. For example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann to re-write the character of Ellie in a stronger and more defensive manner. Some of the dialogue between the duo was improvised by the actors; Druckmann attributed this to the fact that the script included an unnecessary number of lines during gameplay sections, and he allowed the actors to choose what they felt was necessary. The characters of Joel and Ellie were the basis of the game; the development between the characters was established first, and the game's other concepts followed. From the beginning of development, the team intended for The Last of Us to feature dual protagonists with strong individual story arcs. During the Winter segment of the game, players assume control of Ellie. The developers ensured that this change was kept secretive prior to the game's release, to surprise players; they did the same with Ellie's immunity, as well as with the game's prologue, where players assume control of Joel's daughter Sarah. The change of control from Joel to Ellie signifies a change in the role of the protector, echoing Druckmann's previous ideas as a student. The character interactions were inspired by the relationship between Nathan Drake and Tenzin in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, in turn inspired by the video game Ico. The game's protagonists represent the two eras that are shown in the game; Joel represents the world before the outbreak, having spent most of his life during this period, while Ellie represents the world after the outbreak, as she was born in the post-apocalyptic world. While the former is emotionally damaged due to the loss that he has experienced, the latter maintains an optimistic <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> having become familiar to the damaged world; spending time with each other saw these qualities overlapping, with Joel become more lively, and Ellie learning more survival skills.|$|E

25|$|Authors {{occasionally}} forgo claiming authorship, for {{a number}} of reasons. Historically some authors have published anonymously to shield themselves when presenting controversial claims. A key example is Robert Chambers' anonymous publication of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, a speculative, pre-Darwinian work on the origins of life and the cosmos. The book argued for an evolutionary <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in the same spirit as the late Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. Lamarck had long been discredited among intellectuals by this time and evolutionary (or development) theories were exceedingly unpopular, except among the political radicals, materialists, and atheists - Chambers hoped to avoid Lamarck's fate.|$|E

25|$|Von Hartmann is a pessimist, for {{no other}} <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> recognizes that evil {{necessarily}} belongs to existence and can cease only with existence itself. But {{he is not an}} unmitigated pessimist. The individual's happiness is indeed unattainable either here and now or hereafter and in the future, but he does not despair of ultimately releasing the Unconscious from its sufferings. He differs from Schopenhauer in making salvation collective by the negation of the will to live depend on a collective social effort and not on individualistic asceticism. The conception of a redemption of the Unconscious also supplies the ultimate basis of von Hartmann's ethics. We must provisionally affirm life and devote ourselves to social evolution, instead of striving after a happiness which is impossible; in so doing we shall find that morality renders life less unhappy than it would otherwise be. Suicide, and all other forms of selfishness, are highly reprehensible. His realism enables him to maintain the reality of Time, and so of the process of the world's redemption.|$|E
25|$|McLuhan {{writes about}} robotism {{in the context}} of Japanese Zen Buddhism and how it can offer us new ways of {{thinking}} about technology. The Western way of thinking about technology is too much related to the left hemisphere of our brain, which has a rational and linear focus. What he called robotism might better be called androidism in the wake of Blade Runner and the novels of Philip K. Dick. Robotism-androidism emerges from the further development of the right hemisphere of the brain, creativity and a new relationship to spacetime (most humans are still living in 17th century classical Newtonian physics spacetime). Robots-androids will have much greater flexibility than humans have had until now, in both mind and body. Robots-androids will teach humanity this new flexibility. And this flexibility of androids (what McLuhan calls robotism) has a strong affinity with Japanese culture and life. McLuhan quotes from Ruth Benedict, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, an anthropological study of Japanese culture published in 1946: “Occidentals cannot easily credit the ability of the Japanese to swing from one behavior to another without psychic cost. Such extreme possibilities are not included in our experience. Yet in Japanese life the contradictions, as they seem to us, are as deeply based in their <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> as our uniformities are in ours.” The ability to live in the present and instantly readjust.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an empirical {{study of the}} meeting between a group of doctoral students and their research milieus, understood as a web of values in the social rooms. The purpose is to explore what these research milieus mean for the doctoral students and their questions about <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b>   The theoretical points of departure are on one hand the Uppsala Studies in Faith and Ideologies {{and on the other}} the concept of habitus in the study Homo Academicus of Pierre Bourdieu, including the idea that the postgraduate studies {{can be seen as a}} secondary socialization.   The study consists of three parts: an observation study, a questionnaire study and a field survey consisting of personal interviews.   The results are in short: 1.       Approximately seven of ten doctoral students reflect on questions about <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> every day or every week. 2.       The milieus <b>of</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> as interwoven parts of the research milieus, have influence on how the doctoral students think about questions <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> The empirical material shows that there is “a now” and “a then” to these questions. There often appears to be a difference between the cluster <b>of</b> <b>life</b> values in the research milieu and the much more soft values of the students that initiates this process. 3.       The value process mentioned above that is an important part of the secondary socialization often ends in conformity with those values that are parts of the present paradigm. However the process can also end in such a value conflict that the students (ca 25 %) often or very often have reflected on discontinuing their postgraduate studies. The students’ soft values seem to be more important than the values they meet in the research milieu. 4.       These value questions, including the research ethics and the postulates of the paradigms, have little or no place in the university education. A part of the participants are of the opinion that questions about <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> are taboo in their research milieu.   The results from the empirical study are then confronted first with the theoretical concepts of Pierre Bourdieu, particularly his overly structuralistic <b>view</b> <b>of</b> agents and their habitus, and then with some central moments in the theoretical concept of Anders Jeffner, the prominent figure in Uppsala studies in faiths and ideologies. It is Jeffner’s individualistic <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the autonomous actor with a relative constancy in <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> that is called into question by the empirical results of this study...|$|R
