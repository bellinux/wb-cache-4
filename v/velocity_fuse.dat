I {{provide an}} {{observational}} {{review of the}} properties of starburstdriven galactic superwinds, focusing mainly on recent results pertinent to the transport of metals and energy into the IGM. Absorption-line studies are providing rich kinematic information on both neutral and ionized gas in superwinds, with observed mass flow rates similar to the star formation rate and outflow velocities comparable {{to or greater than}} the escape <b>velocity.</b> <b>FUSE</b> observations of the Ovi doublet provide previously unattainable information regarding outflow velocities and radiative cooling rates in hot gas at T ∼ 3 × 10 5 K. Emission from gas at temperatures of 10 4 K and ∼ 5 × 10 6 K is now being studied with unprecedented spatial resolution using HST and Chandra, tracing the complex interaction of the still-invisible wind of SN-ejecta with the ambient ISM entrained into these outflows.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of nanostructures under high strain-rate conditions has been {{object of interest}} in recent years. For instance, recent experimental investigations showed that at high velocity impacts carbon nanotubes can unzip resulting into graphene nanoribbons. Carbon nanoscrolls (CNS) are among the structures whose high impact behavior {{has not yet been}} investigated. CNS are graphene membranes rolled up into papyrus-like structures. Their unique open-ended topology leads to properties not found in close-ended structures, such as nanotubes. Here we report a fully atomistic reactive molecular dynamics study on the {{behavior of}} CNS colliding at high velocities against solid targets. Our results show that the velocity and scroll axis orientation are key parameters to determine the resulting formed nanostructures after impact. The relative orientation of the scroll open ends and the substrate is also very important. We observed that for appropriate velocities and orientations, the nanoscrolls can experience large structural deformations and large-scale fractures. We have also observed unscrolling (scrolls going back to planar or quasi-planar graphene membranes), unzip resulting into nanoribbons, and significant reconstructions from breaking and/or formation of new chemical bonds. Another interesting result was that if the CNS impact the substrate with their open ends, for certain <b>velocities,</b> <b>fused</b> scroll walls were observed...|$|R
40|$|For {{small-scale}} Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) {{to operate}} indoor, in urban canyons or other scenarios where signals from global navigation satellite systems are denied or impaired, alternative estimation and control strategies must be applied. In this paper {{a system is}} proposed that estimates the self-motion and wind <b>velocity</b> by <b>fusing</b> information from airspeed sensors, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a monocular camera. Such estimates {{can be used in}} control systems for managing wind disturbances or chemical plume based tracking strategies. Simulation results indicate that while the inertial dead-reckoning process is subject to drift, the system is capable of separating the self-motion and wind velocity from the airspeed information.

The dynamics of its built-in sensors, roll and pitch attitude controller, and system latencies are determined and used to design a computationally inexpensive multi-rate <b>velocity</b> estimator that <b>fuses</b> data from the built-in inertial sensors and a low-rate onboard laser range finder. Control is performed using a nested loop structure that is also computationally inexpensive and incorporates different sensors. Experimental results for the estimator and closed-loop positioning are presented and compared with ground truth from a motion capture system. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{dependence}} of the oxidation rate of steel beneath an enamel film at its firing temperatures is studied. During the firing process foci of intense oxidation of metal with pronounced dark coloration appear in individual locations {{on the surface of}} steel samples, coated with a layer of enamel melt, in air. If the melt in such a focus is enriched with variable-valence oxides to acquisition of electronic conduction, then the oxidation process propagates with constant <b>velocity</b> in the <b>fused</b> enamel along the entire surface of the metal. The propagation velocity of the oxidation process depends on the viscosity and composition of the melt. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R
40|$|We {{attempt to}} address two issues in seismic data processing: 1) {{quantifying}} {{the various forms}} of error that enter into the seismic data processing work-flow and relating them to uncertainty on imaged structures; and, 2) the data fusion problem, i. e. combining different sources of information, each related to seismic velocity. To begin addressing these issues a synthetic model was generated consisting of 4 tilted layers (3 interfaces), each with a different isotropic P-wave velocity. A synthetic well log was extracted from this model to be incorporated later. Synthetic shot gathers were also created. Following the standard seismic processing work-flow, stacking velocities were estimated. Uncertainty on these velocities was incorporated by under- and over-picking the velocities by ± 10 % and examining the effects on the final image. The stacking velocity information was then converted to interval <b>velocity</b> and <b>fused</b> with the well velocity information. Along with the under-, over-, and best picked velocities, realizations of the velocity field were created via geostatistical methods according to an assumed correlation structure. By further applying time migration and time to depth conversion, equiprobable realizations of the subsurface structure were generated along with upper and lower bounds on their locations. The realizations honor all the existing data sets and give a visual representation of the uncertainty on the spatial location of imaged structures. ChevronTexaco (Firm...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} mine microseism locating {{methods are}} mainly {{based on the}} assumption that the wave velocity is uniform through the space, which leads to some errors for the assumption goes against the laws of nature. In this paper, the wave velocity is regarded as a random variable, and the probability distribution information of the wave <b>velocity</b> is <b>fused</b> into the traditional locating method. This paper puts forwards the microseism source location method for the undersea mining on condition of the probability distribution of the wave velocity and comes up with the solving process of Monte Carlo. In addition, based on the simulated results of the Monte Carlo method, the space is divided into three areas: the most possible area (area I), the possible area (area II), and the small probability area (area III). Attached to corresponding mathematical formulations, spherical models and cylindrical models in different areas are, respectively, built according to whether the source is in the sensor arrays. Both the examples and the actual applications show that (1) the method of microseism source location in this paper can highly improve the accuracy of the microseism monitoring, especially for the source beyond the sensor arrays, and (2) the space-dividing method based on occurrence possibilities of the source can recognize and sweep the hidden dangers for it predicts the probable location range of the source efficiently, while the traditional method cannot...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{developments of}} Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) systems with application to autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Precisely, this work shows {{the development of}} navigation system based on nonlinear complementary filters for position, velocity and attitude estimation using low-cost sensors. The proposed filtering method provides attitude estimates in quaternion representations and position and <b>velocity</b> estimates by <b>fusing</b> measurements from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), GPS, and a barometer. Least Square Method (LSM) was used in gains tuning to find the best-fitting of the estimated states with precise measurements obtained by a vision based motion capture system. A complete navigation system was produced by integrating both the attitude and the position filters. The integration of the filtering approach based primarily on the ease of design and computational load. Furthermore, {{the structure of the}} filtering design allow for straightforward implementation without a need of high performance signal processing. Moreover, the filters can be tuned totally independent of each other. This work also introduces a nonlinear flight controller for stability and trajectory tracking that is practical for real-time implementation. This controller is also demonstrated the ability of a supervisory controller to provide effective waypoint navigation capabilities in autonomous UAV. The implementation of the guidance, navigation, and control algorithms were adopted in the design of a novel smartphone based autopilot for particular quadrotor aerial platforms. The performances of the proposed work are then evaluated by means of several flight tests. The work also includes a design of advanced navigation and guidance systems based on Robot Operating System (ROS) for Search And Rescue (SAR) missions. Primarily, the performance of the navigation and guidance systems were tested in laboratory by simulating GPS measurements in Linux computer mounted {{on the top of a}} quadrotor. This activity facilitates moving by the experiments from indoor to outdoor...|$|R
