5|$|After {{making her}} acting {{debut in the}} 2000 war film Refugee, Kapoor {{established}} herself in Hindi cinema with roles in the historical drama Aśoka, and the blockbuster melodrama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (both 2001). This initial success {{was followed by a}} series of commercial failures and repetitive roles, which garnered her negative reviews. The year 2004 marked a turning point for Kapoor when she played against type in the role of a sex worker in the drama Chameli. She subsequently earned wide critical recognition for her portrayal of a riot <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2004 drama Dev and a character based on William Shakespeare's heroine Desdemona in the 2006 crime film Omkara. She went on to receive Filmfare Awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress for her performances in the 2007 romantic comedy Jab We Met and the 2010 drama We Are Family, respectively. Kapoor achieved further success by featuring as the female lead in two of India's top-grossing productions—the 2009 comedy-drama 3 Idiots and the 2015 social drama Bajrangi Bhaijaan—and received praise for her roles in the 2009 thriller Kurbaan and the 2012 drama Heroine.|$|E

40|$|This study {{experimentally}} {{examines the}} effects of participant sex, perpetrator sex, and severity of violence on perceptions of intimate partner violence (IPV) seriousness, sympathy toward the victim, and punishment preferences for the perpetrator. Participants (N = 449) {{were randomly assigned to}} a condition, exposed to a composite news story, and then completed a survey. Ratings of seriousness of IPV for stories with male perpetrators were significantly higher than ratings of seriousness for stories with female perpetrators. Men had significantly higher sympathy for female <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> any condition than for male <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> weak or strong severity of violence conditions. Men’s sympathy for male <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fatal severity of violence condition did not differ from their sympathy for female victims. Women had the least sympathy for female <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> weak severity condition and men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> weak or strong severity conditions. Women reported significantly higher sympathy for female <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> strong and fatal severity of violence conditions. Women’s ratings of sympathy for male <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fatal severity of violence condition were statistically indistinguishable from any other group. Participants reported stronger punishment preferences for male perpetrators and this effect was magnified among men. Theoretical implications are presented with attention provided to practical considerations about support for public health services...|$|R

5|$|Jigsaw then leads Tapp to the asylum's crematorium, {{where he}} informs Tapp {{that some people}} {{actually}} desire his tests, much to Tapp's surprise. At the crematorium is Obi Tate, an arsonist who had put advertisements in the newspaper seeking for Jigsaw to test him. Tapp saves him from a burning furnace, but Obi is still frustrated {{because he wanted to}} survive his own test. Feeling that Tapp is throwing away a gift from Jigsaw, Obi runs away. Tapp then ventures through a theater, where he finds evidence that a former Jigsaw victim being held there. He soon finds that it is Jeff Thomas, the man who was saved by Sing while he and Tapp were in Jigsaw's lair. Jeff has since become suicidal from Tapp's incessant questioning, and has been recaptured by Jigsaw. Tapp saves Thomas from a wall of spikes. Thomas is still frustrated, so he runs away, wounded. As this was the last <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> asylum, Tapp is free to pursue Jigsaw, but encounters Pighead again. Jigsaw informs Tapp that Pighead wishes to surpass Jigsaw and sabotage Tapp's game, so he must be stopped.

5|$|In {{light of}} Fighter Command's need for {{units in the}} south of the country, No. 41 Squadron was redeployed to RAF Hornchurch in Essex on 3 September 1940. On 5 September, Lock flew as Red 2, {{positioned}} behind and protecting the Squadron's Leader. He shot down two Heinkel He 111s over the Thames Estuary. One of his victims crashed into a river, the other caught fire and its undercarriage fell down. Lock followed it down. He quickly realised his mistake—reducing height to pursue a damaged enemy put a pilot at risk from enemy fighters—but it was too late. A Messerschmitt Bf 109 attacked him and he sustained damage to his Spitfire and a wound to his leg. Lock immediately zoom-climbed. The Bf 109 attempted to follow but the pilot stalled and fell away. Lock reversed direction and dived. Waiting for the German fighter to come out of its dive he fired several short bursts and it exploded. Looking around he saw the second He 111 land in the English Channel, about ten miles from the first. Lock circled above the He 111 and noticing a boat he alerted the boat to its presence by flying over it and led the vessel to the crash site. As he left the scene he saw the crew surrendering to the occupants of the boat. On the way home he saw his first <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river, with a dingy nearby. A further Bf 109 was claimed destroyed on that date.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Repeat <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West report crimes {{more often}} than other <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> order to see the {{offender}} arrested and/or to stop what is happening. Repeat victims know or assume that the same offender(s) are victimising them again and again. Repeat victims contact the police with more demanding aims than other victims. The reporting patterns of repeat <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West resemble those of all <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> poorer countries. Like <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> these countries, Western repeat victims are less inclined to report at all. This finding suggests that they are less certain that the police can satisfy their needs. Repeat <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West do not refrain from reporting because they consider their victimisation not serious enough. They {{are more likely than}} one-time victims to refrain because they feel the police could not or would not do anything to help them. In this respect, too, they resemble victims from poorer countries. Repeat victims are less often satisfied with <b>the</b> police response <b>in</b> all regions. <b>The</b> differences are most pronounced among victims from industrialised countries. The reduced level of satisfaction of repeat victims with overall police performance is rooted in negative personal experiences with the police.
