5|$|The 15th {{edition of}} the Belk Bowl was played in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday, December 29, 2016. This was the 24th {{consecutive}} bowl game for Virginia Tech and Justin Fuente's first bowl game as {{head coach of the}} Hokies football team. This was the first time ever these two teams played each other. The first and second halves were totally different in terms of how each team did. Virginia Tech was losing 24-0 at halftime but turned the game around in the second half aided by 3 interceptions and six sacks, and won 24-35. This resulted in a season record of 10-4 and was the first time a Hokie football coach won 10 games in his first season and the first Hokie 10-win season since 2011. This {{was the first time the}} Hokies won 3 straight bowl games. Only one of the 5 Hokie touchdowns was not the result of an Arkansas turnover. This was the only game in the college football 2016 in which a team trailing by 24 or more points ended up winning the game. There was a <b>very</b> <b>confusing</b> ruling in the second quarter that took the officials about 12 minutes to sort out. Arkansas punted and the Hokies muffed it. Arkansas touched the ball and the Hokies recovered. But there was also an inadvertent whistle blown. Officials disagree on what the ruling should have been. The game officials gave the ball back to Arkansas.|$|E

25|$|The {{first term}} is a {{constant}} contribution to the free energy, and can be ignored. The second term is a finite shift in t. The third term is a quantity that scales to zero at long distances. This means that when analyzing the scaling of t by dimensional analysis, it is the shifted t that is important. This was historically <b>very</b> <b>confusing,</b> because the shift in t at any finite λ is finite, but near the transition t is very small. The fractional change in t is very large, and in units where t is fixed the shift looks infinite.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} in Rossio, with the pouring {{of the populace}} into the streets, was <b>very</b> <b>confusing</b> but advantageous to the republicans, given the obvious public support. Machado Santos spoke to General Gorjão Henriques and invited him to keep the role of commandant of the division, but he refused. António Carvalhal, {{known to be a}} republican sympathiser, then received command. Soon afterwards, at 9 o'clock in the morning, the Republic was proclaimed by José Relvas from the balcony of the Paços do Concelho. A provisional government was then nominated, presided by members of the Portuguese Republican Party, with the purpose to govern the nation until a new constitution was approved.|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} the prostitution plot, Christina Hendricks said, [...] "This is a <b>very</b> <b>confusing</b> situation for Joan and for everyone involved. First off, it's just completely insulting. Second of all, it's quite an opportunity. Then {{all of a}} sudden you put the money involved or the opportunity involved or you put a label on it, then it becomes a scary road to go down." [...] Hendricks said that Joan's motivation was [...] "protection [...] her child." [...] Hendricks felt that Joan saw herself as an equal in a way to the other partners after going through with the deal, as Joan had seen them do worse things over her thirteen years in employment.|$|E
500|$|However Liam {{is forced}} to {{maintain}} his responsibility. Breeds attributes this to the fact he has a [...] "professional career to think about it. He's not a teenager, so he's in a different place. I think it's <b>very</b> <b>confusing</b> for him. Liam issued a firm warning that he would terminate their professional relationship if her feelings became uncontrollable." [...] Breeds subsequently stated {{she did not think}} Liam was right for Ruby. She said the ideal scenario for the pair would be [...] "in a different lifetime and if they were closer in age. It would have been beautiful if there weren't logistics standing in the way." [...] Ruby then cannot handle rejection and turns to alcohol for comfort and to [...] "numb her feelings".|$|E

500|$|The game {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics upon release. It {{was referred}} to by GameFan as [...] "quite possibly the greatest game ever made", a quote selected for the back cover of the game's jewel case. GameSpot commented that [...] "never before have technology, playability, and narrative combined {{as well as in}} Final Fantasy VII," [...] expressing particular favor toward the game's graphics, audio, and story. IGN's Jay Boor insisted the game's graphics were [...] "light years beyond anything ever seen on the PlayStation", and regarded its battle system as its strongest point. Computer and Video Gamess Alex C praised the dramatic story and well-developed characters. Edge noted that Final Fantasy VII had come close to being an interactive movie in playable form, praising its combination of a complex story that went against Western graphic adventures trends and [...] "excellently orchestrated chip music". RPGamer praised the game's soundtrack, both in variety and sheer volume, stating that [...] "Uematsu has done his work exceptionally well" [...] and saying that it was potentially his best work. Final Fantasy VII has received some negative criticism. Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine (OPM) and GameSpot questioned the game's linear progression. OPM considered the game's translation [...] "a bit muddy" [...] and felt the summon animations were [...] "repetitive." [...] RPGamer cited its translation as [...] "packed with typos and other errors which further obscure what is already a <b>very</b> <b>confusing</b> plot." [...] GamePro also considered the Japanese-to-English translation a significant weakness in the game, and IGN regarded the ability to use only three characters at a time as [...] "the game's only shortcoming." ...|$|E
500|$|Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film {{a score of}} C+, {{describing}} the film as a long cutscene for fans of the game rather than something equivalent to the recent Warcraft movie adaptation: {{he said that the}} visuals [...] "offer a deep dive into the Uncanny Valley", and praised the lead actors' efforts with a script he found weak. Meghan Sullivan, writing for IGN, gave the movie a score of 6/10: she called the movie [...] "gorgeous", and praised the character design despite some issues with realistic facial expressions, and found the story was bogged down by the political elements when the action side and the plot focusing on the Kingsglaive worked. In contrast, she called the voicework [...] "solid", saying that the leads brought their characters to life and prevented the script from sounding too ridiculous while the supporting cast was weaker overall. She summed up Kingsglaive as [...] "a very beautiful and <b>very</b> <b>confusing</b> movie". Andrew Barker for Variety frequently questioned whether Kingsglaive could count as a movie, as he often felt like he was watching a recorded gameplay video, praising the visuals while generally faulting the plot as rushed and too full of throwaway characters. Wired's Matt Kamen gave the film a score of 5/10. He greatly praised the movie's visuals, and was positive about the lead actors' performances and the action scenes. His criticism was leveled at its poor portrayal of the female characters, called the narrative confusing, and felt that it focused too much on setting up the events of Final Fantasy XV. His main feeling was that, while it held promise, it relied too much on character stereotypes and world building, calling it [...] "a gorgeous but over-stuffed slice of fanservice".|$|E

2500|$|The sac spiders of {{the family}} Clubionidae have a <b>very</b> <b>confusing</b> taxonomic history. Once, this family was a large {{catch-all}} taxon for a disparate collection of spiders, similar only in that they had eight eyes arranged in two rows and conical anterior spinnerets that touched, and were wandering predators that built silken retreats, or sacs, usually on plant terminals, between leaves, under bark, or under rocks. These are now recognized to include several families, {{some of which are}} more closely related to the three-clawed spiders, like lynx and wolf spiders, than to true [...] "clubionoids".|$|E
2500|$|The terms [...] "left" [...] and [...] "right" [...] are {{sometimes}} used, or their Latin alternatives ( [...] ; [...] "right", [...] "left"). However, as {{left and right}} sides are mirror images, using these words is somewhat confusing, as structures are duplicated on both sides. For example, it's <b>very</b> <b>confusing</b> to say the dorsal fin of a dolphin is [...] "right of" [...] the left pectoral fin, but is [...] "left of" [...] the right eye, but much easier and clearer to say [...] "the dorsal fin is medial to the pectoral fins".|$|E

2500|$|GameSpy's Will Tuttle and Sal Accardo also {{praised the}} {{graphics}} and online mode, but they too criticized the single player campaign. [...] "Historical Campaign [...] gets <b>very</b> <b>confusing</b> because you frequently switch sides from battle to battle", stated Tuttle. He added that {{it felt like}} the game's campaign was [...] "tacked on to allow people without PS2 online to have fun." [...] 1UP.com's Andrew Pfister followed suit, also praising the graphics. [...] "Visually, Battlefront is exceptional. Never before have the Star Wars battles been so well recreated and detailed". He criticized the game's AI, however. He felt that it was too easy to defeat them, and that they often did not follow commands issued by the player. As with other reviewers, Pfister felt the single player mode was the weak point of the game, citing the PlayStation 2 version specifically for players without online access. Overall, he felt the problems with the game were outweighed by its qualities. [...] "Battlefront manages to stand tall as a great game that does the best job we've yet seen of playing out the battles of the Star Wars movies." ...|$|E

[...] When Billboard previewed the album in January 2010, Ben-Yehuda Ayala said [...] "Lopez sings, talk-sings and broods (within pop reason) on the subject of love," [...] while Rap-Up said it is very much in keeping with the title, [...] "a love roller coaster, taking you through {{the ups and downs of}} a relationship." [...] Following her move to Island Def Jam, Lopez said she would still be pressing ahead with the album under the title Love?. [...] "I just feel like it's an endlessly fascinating topic that all my albums have been about. It's still <b>very</b> <b>confusing</b> to me and so I explore that on this album, probably more than my other albums." [...] She also revealed that her husband Marc Anthony initially disapproved of the title because he felt that it may imply that the couple were having marital problems. However in {{interviews with}} DJ Skee, she said [...] "love has always been a theme of my career and this record wasn't going to be different. The album has a lot of up-tempo, dancy, urban tracks." ...|$|E

2500|$|A re-evaluation of Dee's {{character}} and significance {{came in the}} 20th century, {{largely as a result}} of the work of the historians Charlotte Fell-Smith and Dame Frances Yates. Both writers brought into focus the parallel roles magic, science and religion held in the Elizabethan Renaissance. Fell-Smith writes: [...] "There is perhaps no learned author in history who has been so persistently misjudged, nay, even slandered, by his posterity, and not a voice in all the three centuries uplifted even to claim for him a fair hearing. Surely it is time that the cause of all this universal condemnation should be examined in the light of reason and science; and perhaps it will be found to exist mainly in the fact that he was too far advanced in speculative thought for his own age to understand." [...] As a result of this and subsequent re-evaluation, Dee is now viewed as a serious scholar and book-collector, a devoted Christian (albeit during a <b>very</b> <b>confusing</b> time for that faith), an able scientist, and one of the most learned men of his day. His personal library at Mortlake was the largest in the country (before it was vandalized), and was created at enormous and sometimes ruinous personal expense; it was considered one of the finest in Europe, perhaps second only to that of De Thou. As well as being an astrological and scientific advisor to Elizabeth and her court, he was an early advocate of the colonisation of North America and a visionary of a British Empire stretching across the North Atlantic.|$|E
