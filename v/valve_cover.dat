25|$|In April 2009, {{the recall}} already posted for the Supercharged {{iterations}} of the 3800 Series II was expanded {{to cover all}} 3800 Series II engine-equipped vehicles after many fires were reported with Grand Prix GT and 3.8L equipped SE versions, {{as well as the}} sister car Buick Regal LS. The recall for the non-supercharged V6 was to remove the front spark plug retainer and a <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> gasket is not changed on non-supercharged 3.8 engines. The recall covered nearly 1.5 million vehicles.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, GM {{announced}} a recall on all 1997–2003 Grand Prix GTP models (as well as sister car Buick Regal GS) {{due to a}} problem that causes fires in the engine compartment. Over 230 fires were reported. This recall affected over 200,000 vehicles equipped with the supercharged 3800 Series II engine. GM {{sent a letter to}} the owners of these vehicles on March 13, 2008, instructing them not to park in garages or carports until the problem was resolved. The recall for the Supercharged engine involved changing the left (front) <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> gasket, as oil leaks onto the exhaust manifold may cause engine fires. Some believed this recall did not fix the fire problem, and instead the problem is likely faulty fuel rail quick disconnect o-rings. There have been reports of fires happening after the recall has been performed.|$|E
25|$|VAM's {{decision}} to focus all {{efforts on the}} new two-version Lerma model plus the loss of luxury accessories meant the discontinuation of Rally SST for 1982. The loss of the exemption of 500 units of automobile engines without emission certification forced the retirement of the Rally GT. The only model left for 1982 was the Rally AMX, with substantial differences from the previous two years. The taillight surrounding areas plus the headlight bezels and front hood molding were completely blacked out, the last two parts also having a horizontal red stripe passing from edge to edge. An all-new grille design with a horizontal bar {{at the same height}} of the bezels' division between the parking lights and headlights and a vertical bar at the very center; behind these was a set of smaller narrower horizontal lines. Both bumpers for the year were those of the AMC Eagle SX/4 Sport, being blacked out equipped with thick nerfing strips with central bright moldings and longer more aerodynamic bumper end caps with their respective bright molding. Unlike the previous two years, no decals or stickers of any kind were used. The standard wheel designs for the year were the eight spoke steel units with blacked out volcano hubcaps. Due to the impossibility of having the bullet-type door mirrors reproduced, the model switched to sporty design that was used in the 1978–1980 models. However, the remote controls for these mirrors while still available were moved to the option list. The Recaro-type seats received new patterns with a smaller bucket shape to allow an easier {{in and out of the}} car in the driver's side (due to the lack of a tilt steering column). The door panels were the same units as in 1981 except for the change in the fabric portion from plain to a pattern of vertical stripes and the removal of a fake chrome molding in place of a woodgrain unit. The six-bolt sports steering wheel was replaced by a leather-wrapped three-arm Nardi unit. VAM managed to find a local company to reproduce the center console, but it was reduced to the shifter and gauges portions, deleting the armrest with the rear ashtray. Despite the loss in accessories, two new options arrived for the year in the form of the AM FM stereo tape player radio and the rear wiper and washer. The car received two changes in the mid year, the first being a new wooden sports steering wheel and the second a new set of ten-round-spoke steel wheels. Mechanically, the only novelties for the year were wider gear ratios for the A998 automatic transmission and in the mid year a new head design with rounded internal intake ports and smaller spark plug outlets, still retaining the metal <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> of the previous years. A different head gasket was used to bring the compression ratio from 8.0:1 to 8.5:1.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] {{engine was}} {{developed}} by AMC in just 26 months using many off the shelf components while featuring, among others, additional strength, improved combustion chamber, port setup, and cam profile. The total weight of the new engine was , only one pound more than the 258 six despite its heavier components and parts. For example, the cast aluminum <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> featured 15 bolts, the industry's most, to achieve a positive seal.|$|E
2500|$|The last-of-the-line 1977s {{were treated}} to Pontiac's new 151cuin [...] "Iron Duke" [...] {{inline-four}} engine. Both the cylinder block and cylinder head are cast-iron. Standard in the Astre and Sunbird, {{they were the first}} GM vehicles to utilize the engine which was widely used into the 1990s. 1977 Astre models also featured a new vertical design grill and aluminum wheels (13-inch) were a new option. The [...] "Formula" [...] option was also introduced for the Astre's final year, which included the handling package, chrome <b>valve</b> <b>cover,</b> three-piece spoiler, Formula T/A steering wheel and special decals.|$|E
2500|$|The City Turbo {{shared the}} 1231 cc (1.2L) CVCC [...] "ER" [...] engine with its more {{pedestrian}} siblings, but {{the addition of}} a turbocharger meant that [...] at 5,500rpm and [...] at 3,000rpm were available. Further changes to the engine included an aluminum/titanium alloy head and a magnesium <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> to keep the weight down. The IHI RHB51 turbocharger, developed as a joint venture between Ishikawajima Heavy Industry and Honda, was lighter and smaller than most other turbos and could run at higher rpm. When combined with Honda's PGM-FI fuel injection and an 8-bit digital computer control unit, the end result was a very efficient engine with minimal turbo lag. 0–100km/h was possible in 8.6 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|Other factory {{variants}} {{included the}} R100CS of 1983-1984. The R90S always had [...] "/5" [...] type [...] "round" [...] <b>valve</b> <b>covers,</b> but the R100CS had black-painted [...] "squared" [...] <b>valve</b> <b>covers.</b> The other bikes in the BMW [...] "/6" [...] range were the new R90/6, the R75/6, and the R60/6. The 500cc R50/5 was discontinued and no [...] "R50/6" [...] version was produced.|$|R

2500|$|American Motors did {{not provide}} {{identification}} on the engine block, known as VIN stamping, as some other car manufacturers had been doing at that time. Other than the actual displacement, {{there was no way}} to associate a vehicle with the original [...] "born with" [...] engine. Since this was common practice at the GM and Chrysler plants it is much easier to verify that the exact engine in the car is actually the factory original unit. Each AMC vehicle was inspected to confirm that the engine displacement (identified by numbers cast on the block under the engine mounts) corresponded to its corresponding engine code in the vehicle identification number (VIN). A tag screwed to the <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> provides an engine's build date, and that date code always preceded a specific car's production sequence. However, there is no engine [...] "numbers matching" [...] test for AMXs or any other AMC automobiles.|$|E
2500|$|Small {{changes were}} made to the {{cylinder}} head for the 1995 model year. In 1996, the engine block was redesigned for greater strength. The new block had more webbing and a stud girdle for added rigidity of the crankshaft main bearings. Engines installed in 1999 Grand Cherokees carried the [...] "PowerTech" [...] name that had been used intermittently in prior years and on other Chrysler truck and SUV engines. The name was subsequently passed on to 4.0s in the other Jeep models that used the engine, the Cherokee and Wrangler. The cylinder head was again changed for the 2000 model year to a more emissions-friendly design. This head was designated as [...] "0331" [...] in the casting number. Early 0331 heads are prone to cracking, causing coolant to contaminate the oil, which can lead to catastrophic engine failure. The head cracks in the center between #3 and #4 cylinders. The crack is usually discernible with the <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> removed as a [...] "milky" [...] tan line. This condition is usually discovered before catastrophic engine failure, but can lead there if not corrected in a timely manner. The casting was fixed in mid to late 2001, but the same casting number was retained. The [...] "fixed" [...] heads have [...] "TUPY" [...] cast in the center where the cracks used to occur. Also new for the 2000 model year, was the distributorless, coil on plug ignition system. Option code: ERH.|$|E
2500|$|The {{downturn}} of the Mexican economy {{early in}} 1982 {{and a government}} decree banning the importation of [...] "luxury" [...] automotive accessories hit the country's auto industry. The 1982 VAM Gremlin returned as a slightly consolidated model. Both trim levels incorporated amber front parking lights and the AMC square pattern grille design {{that was used in}} U.S. domestic Eagle models. The base model incorporated chromed headlight bezels with blacked out internal areas while the X model were completely blacked out as also was the hood trim molding. The [...] I6 was upgraded {{for the first time since}} 1976, receiving a higher 8.5:1 compression ratio and net output of [...] at 4000rpm. This was achieved through a new head design that incorporated smaller spark plug outlets and a plastic <b>valve</b> <b>cover.</b> The A904 model automatic transmission was replaced in favor of the A998 model with wider gear ratios. The base model was similar to the prior year's except for new side trim and front end design. The X model saw the return of side decals the form of four thin stripes starting at the base of the B-pillar trim molding running all the way to the front edge of the fenders near the marker lights. A new silver [...] "GX" [...] decal appeared between the rear window and the right side tail light. For some reason, the sports steering wheel was replaced by the base design. The model was restricted to a three-speed automatic transmission with the novelty of the AMX/GT's console-type shifter boot and the rear differential changed to a [...] 3.07:1 ratio as used the year before with the now-unavailable four-speed manual.|$|E

50|$|Rules and {{regulations}} will change {{depending on the}} venue, but the basics remain the same: Competitors must construct a vehicle using a <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> from a car's engine. Usually it must have four wheels. It can be decorated or modified within the rules set by the organizing body. The <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> is powered by gravity. In a <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> race, two or more racing valve covers are placed {{at the top of}} a specially constructed incline, which can be straight or curved. They are released at the same time and the first to cross a finish line at the bottom of the incline wins the race. Win lights or timers may be used to more accurately determine the winner of a race. <b>Valve</b> <b>cover</b> racing is often an event for children at car shows, although adult <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> race events are also seen.|$|E

The <b>valve</b> <b>covers</b> on the Magnum have 10 bolts rather than the previous 5, for improved oil sealing. In addition, the <b>valve</b> <b>covers</b> were made of thicker steel than earlier parts, and were installed with a silicone gasket.|$|R

5000|$|All 1956 U.S. Mercury {{models were}} {{powered by the}} 312 cu in (5.1 L) V8 {{breathing}} through a four-barrel carburetor. At {{the beginning of the}} model year, a 210-horsepower version with 8.0:1 compression ratio powered Mercury cars with manual transmissions (including three-speed plus overdrive), while a 225-horsepower version powered cars with automatic transmissions. The 225-horsepower version had an 8.4:1 compression ratio. Later in the model year, a 235-horsepower version with 9.0:1 compression ratio became available. All 1956 Mercury engines had gold-painted blocks and heads. The 210-horsepower version had red <b>valve</b> <b>covers</b> and air cleaner, while the 225-horsepower version had blue <b>valve</b> <b>covers</b> and air cleaner. The 235-horsepower version had argent silver <b>valve</b> <b>covers</b> and air cleaner. A dealer-installed [...] "M 260" [...] engine kit was released in January 1956. The kit consisted of a hotter camshaft, revised cylinder heads, and an intake manifold mounting two four-barrel carburetors.
