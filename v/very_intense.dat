5|$|On 16 April, Fantala turned {{more to the}} west-northward {{toward the}} {{southern}} islands of the Seychelles, steered by a strengthening ridge near Madagascar. Intensification resumed by 12:00UTC the following day, with the JTWC estimating 1-minute sustained winds of 270km/h (165mph), classifying Fantala as a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Around 15:00UTC, the cyclone moved through the Farquhar Group of the Seychelles, and its eyewall moved over several small islands. At 18:00UTC on 17 April, the MFR upgraded Fantala to a <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> tropical cyclone; based on a Dvorak T-number of T7.5, the satellite-derived wind estimate was 10-minute sustained winds of 250km/h (155mph), along with an estimated barometric pressure of 910mbar (hPa; 26.87inHg). However, in the best track for Fantala, the MFR concluded that Fantala had been a <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> tropical cyclone 6 hours earlier as well, with 10-minute sustained winds of 220km/h (140mph), and that its minimum central pressure of 910mbar (hPa; 26.87inHg) had occurred 12 hours later, at 06:00UTC the following day.

5|$|Should the named storm intensify {{further and}} reach winds speeds of 48knots (89km/h, 55mph), {{then it will}} be {{classified}} as a severe tropical storm. A severe tropical storm is designated as a tropical cyclone when it reaches wind speeds of 64knots (118km/h, 74mph). Should a tropical cyclone intensify further and reach wind speeds of 90knots (166km/h, 103mph), it will be classified as an intense tropical cyclone. A <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> tropical cyclone is the highest category on the South-West Indian Ocean Tropical Cyclone scale, and has winds of over 115knots (212km/h, 132mph).|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone was first observed on September 1 off the southeast {{coast of the}} United States. Initially, it {{was believed to be}} the same storm that struck Guadeloupe on the same day, though subsequent research indicated there were two separate storms. The hurricane tracked by the Bahamas while tracking generally northward, and it attained major hurricane status over the western Atlantic Ocean. As it approached the United States coastline, the hurricane was <b>very</b> <b>intense,</b> with winds estimated at over 135 mph (215 km/h) and potentially as strong as 160 mph (260 km/h), or a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.

5|$|Multiple eyewalls {{had been}} {{detected}} in very strong hurricanes before, including Typhoon Sarah and Hurricane Donna, although the double eyes were usually seen in <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> systems. Double eyewalls were also seen post-seeding {{in some of}} the seeded storms. At the time however, the only known times that rapid changes in eyewall diameter, other than during presumably successful seedings, was during rapid changes in intensity. It remained controversial whether the seedings caused the secondary eyewalls or whether it was just a natural cycle. Basically, if eyewall changes similar to those observed in seeded hurricanes were rare in unseeded tropical cyclones, it would provide powerful evidence that Project Stormfury was successful. Conversely, if such changes were common in unseeded systems, it would throw doubt on the very hypothesis and assumptions driving Project Stormfury.|$|E
5|$|<b>Very</b> <b>Intense</b> Tropical Cyclone Fantala was {{the most}} intense {{tropical}} cyclone of the south-west Indian Ocean in terms of sustained winds. Part of the 2015–16 cyclone season, Fantala formed on 11 April {{to the south of}} Diego Garcia, an island in the central Indian Ocean. With a ridge to the south, the storm moved westward for several days while gaining strength, aided by warm waters and decreasing wind shear. Late on 17 April, the Météo-France office on Réunion (MFR) estimated peak 10-minute winds of 250km/h (155mph), making Fantala the strongest tropical cyclone of the basin in terms of 10-minute sustained winds. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak 1-minute winds of 285km/h (180mph), equivalent to Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale and the strongest on record in the south-west Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E
5|$|Capcom auditioned {{actors to}} be used as {{references}} by the character designers. The faces of the main protagonists were shaped and based on real people, while motion capture was used to animate their models. About 60 percent of the characters' motions were animated based on the captured data, while the rest was created from scratch. The developers initially struggled to develop a system for computer graphic animation. However, Nintendo provided Capcom with assistance and the problems were eventually solved. Capcom also hired new voice actors and rewrote the game's script to make the plot more convincing. The game was developed over the course of one year and two months. Final development of the game was <b>very</b> <b>intense,</b> as programmers had to work for two straight months with no days off to meet the proposed deadline. Resident Evil was released in March 2002 in Japan, April 2002 in North America, and September 2002 in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Hondo {{continued}} to quickly strengthen, becoming a tropical cyclone, {{the equivalent of}} a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, that same day. After maintaining its through the early hours of February6, a pinhole eye began to develop, signifying that Hondo was beginning to undergo rapid intensification. During this intensification phase, the storm became nearly stationary again due to a weakness in the ridge which was previously steering the cyclone towards the east. Later that day, Hondo was upgraded to an intense tropical cyclone with winds of 175km/h (110mph 10-minute winds). After becoming an intense tropical cyclone, wind shear began to increase, causing the eye to become slightly disorganized, temporarily slowed the intensification. Later in the day, the eye became better defined, allowing Hondo to intensify further. Operationally, Hondo was upgraded to a <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> tropical cyclone with winds of 220km/h (140mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 906hPa (mbar). However, after reanalysis, it was found that Hondo never intensified beyond intense tropical cyclone status and winds peaked at 215km/h (130mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 915hPa (mbar).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ramon was a <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> Pacific {{hurricane}} {{that generated}} heavy rains in Southern California. The 19th named storm and final hurricane of the above-average 1987 Pacific hurricane season, Ramon originated from a tropical disturbance that formed in early October. On October5, {{a tropical storm}} had developed several hundred miles southwest of Manzanillo, bypassing the tropical depression stage. Tropical Storm Ramon turned to the west-northwest after initially moving west. It intensified into a hurricane on October7. Two days later, Hurricane Ramon peaked in intensity with winds of 140mph (220km/h). After peaking, Ramon turned to the northwest and rapidly weakened over cooler waters. It weakened into a tropical storm on October11 and a depression on October12. Ramon dissipated shortly thereafter. While at sea, Ramon brought light rainfall to the Baja California Peninsula. The remnants of Hurricane Ramon produced heavy rainfall that caused flooding in California, indirectly contributing to five traffic-related fatalities. Rainfall was reported as far inland as Utah.|$|E
5|$|On April1, Hudah {{continued}} intensifying while approaching eastern Madagascar, and by 0600UTC that day, the MFR upgraded {{the storm}} to <b>very</b> <b>intense</b> tropical cyclone intensity– the highest rating on the agency's cyclone classification scale. Shortly after, at 1200UTC, {{the storm was}} analyzed to have reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 225km/h (140mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 905mbar (hPa; 26.73inHg), ranking Hudah {{among some of the}} strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded in the Southwest Indian Ocean. The JTWC listed a similar intensity for the storm, with winds of 235km/h (145mph), though these winds were for 1-minute sustained winds instead of 10-minute sustained winds. This intensity was later analyzed to have been very near the theoretical maximum for tropical cyclones in the environmental conditions Hudah was in. At the time, TRMM imagery indicated that the storm featured two concentric eyewalls. Cyclone Hudah maintained peak intensity up until it made its first landfall approximately 28km (17mi) southeast of Antalaha, Madagascar at 1730UTC on April2. Hudah substantially weakened as it traversed the mountainous terrain of northern Madagascar, and was downgraded to tropical depression status by the time it entered the Mozambique Channel at 1200UTC on March3.|$|E
