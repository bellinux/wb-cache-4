5|$|The folwark, a {{large-scale}} system of agricultural production based on serfdom, was a dominant feature on Poland's economic landscape {{beginning in the}} late 15th century and for the next 300 years. This dependence on nobility-controlled agriculture in central-eastern Europe diverged from {{the western part of the}} continent, where elements of capitalism and industrialization were developing to a much greater extent, with the attendant growth of a bourgeoisie class and its political influence. The 16th-century agricultural trade boom combined with free or <b>very</b> <b>cheap</b> peasant labor made the folwark economy very profitable.|$|E

25|$|The main {{challenges}} of Li-S batteries is the low conductivity of sulfur and its massive volume change upon discharging {{and finding a}} suitable cathode {{is the first step}} for commercialization of Li-S batteries. Therefore, most researchers use a carbon/sulfur cathode and a lithium anode. Sulfur is <b>very</b> <b>cheap,</b> but has practically no electroconductivity, 5S⋅cm−1 at 25°C. A carbon coating provides the missing electroconductivity. Carbon nanofibers provide an effective electron conduction path and structural integrity, at the disadvantage of higher cost.|$|E

60|$|But {{please do}} not imagine that the evils of indissoluble {{marriage}} can be cured by divorce laws administered on our present plan. The <b>very</b> <b>cheapest</b> undefended divorce, even when conducted by a solicitor {{for its own sake}} and that of humanity, costs at least 30 pounds out-of-pocket expenses. To a client on business terms it costs about three times as much. Until divorce is as cheap as marriage, marriage will remain indissoluble for all except the handful of people to whom 100 pounds is a procurable sum. For the enormous majority of us there is no difference in this respect between a hundred and a quadrillion. Divorce is the one thing you may not sue for in forma pauperis.|$|R

The main disadvantage of tumbling is its limited scope - stones will be smooth and have semi-random shapes (like pebbles from the beach), and metals need to be relatively simple shapes, with no fine work.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} the {{particles}} will, due to their higher density, not perfectly follow {{the motion of the}} fluid (gas/liquid).

If the density still does not fit, the density of the fluid can be tuned by increasing/ decreasing its temperature. This leads to slight changes in the Reynolds number, so the fluid velocity or the size of the experimental object has to be changed to account for this.|$|E
25|$|On 21 September 1964, {{the island}} was granted {{independence}} as the State of Malta, a member in the Commonwealth of Nations and a Commonwealth realm.
