It is a serpentine road in every respect and the curves are frequent and sharp. In hundreds of places the walls of granite are perpendicular and in many places the road bed is blasted out in the side of the walls of rock which overhang the track."

Richard Cobbett from Eurogamer called the game the best spy game ever made, appreciating {{the fact that the}} story and characters react to players' choices, and other games should learn from it. He concluded by expressing his desire for a sequel. Phil Savage called the game [...] "a wonderful mess, full of great ideas, but hampered by the sort of behind-the-scenes development troubles". He criticized the opening Saudi Arabia level for being [...] "monotonous", but stated that later levels are more <b>varied</b> <b>and</b> <b>interesting.</b> He {{thought that the}} game should be applauded for its modern setting that was rarely explored by other role-playing games, and added that there are many great game design and systems that can be expanded upon by Obsidian or other game development companies. Anthony Burch from Destructoid praised the game's sense of humor, ending variety, and the combat system, in which he stated that the combat's [...] "brokenness" [...] becomes fun.

Equally remarkable are the various discoveries of mammalian fossils in North America, especially in the old lake bottoms now forming what are called the [...] "bad lands" [...] of Dakota and Nebraska, belonging to the Miocene period.

The very richness and abundance of the remains which we find in limited areas, serve to convince us how imperfect and fragmentary must be our knowledge of the earth's fauna at any one past epoch; since we cannot believe that all, or nearly all, of the animals which inhabited any district were entombed in a single lake, or overwhelmed by the floods of a single river.|$|E

60|$|The {{next morning}} we were again off early for our longest journey, that on to Rayray Guddy, where food would be procurable for horse and man, neither one nor the other being {{obtainable}} at Guinea-fowl Plain, {{where there is no}} commissariat station. We had carried our own food, and a small portion of grain for the horses; but they would have fared very badly had we not met some natives in the pass with a bundle of hay, and done a little barter with them for rice. The valley for the first twelve or fourteen miles from Guinea-fowl Plain greatly resembled in its general features that we had passed the day previously, but the vegetation became more <b>varied</b> <b>and</b> <b>interesting</b> every mile. We now had great trees of ivy, we had the evergreen oak, and occasionally gigantic tulip-trees. We had great numbers of a tree, or rather large shrub, of the name of which I am ignorant; its leaves more resembled the sprays of the asparagus when it has run far to seed than any other foliage I know, but the growth of the shrub was more like a yew. Upon its branches were vast quantities of a parasite resembling the mistletoe, whose dark-green leaves afforded a fine contrast to the rather bluish tint of the tree. Climbing everywhere over the trees, and sometimes almost hiding them, were creepers of various kinds; on the ground grew vast quantities of the aloe. There were, too, numerous cacti of various kinds, some thick and bulky, others no thicker than a lady’s little finger, and growing like a creeper over the trees. But, strangest of all, upon the hill-sides grew an immense plant, or rather tree, of the cactus tribe, which I had never seen before. It started by a straight stem fifteen or twenty feet high, and thicker than a man’s body. This branched out into a great number of arms, which all grew upwards, and to just the same height, giving it a strange and formal appearance, exactly resembling a gigantic cauliflower. I believe its name is Euphorbia candalabriensis, but do not at all vouch for this. Some of the mountain slopes were quite covered with this strange tree, but as a general thing it grew singly or in pairs. The tulip-trees were superb; they grew generally in rocky places, and with their huge twisted trunks, and glossy green leaves, and limbs more than a hundred feet long, they were studies for a painter.|$|E

By using a computer for language teaching, and not a book, you can produce very flexible exercises, which are easy to change, more <b>varied</b> <b>and</b> more <b>interesting</b> to use.

We now have the labourer's minimum wage, which, I think, will want increasing; but we want good rural housing on an economically sound basis, an enlivened village life, and all that can be done to give the worker on the land a feeling that he can rise, the sense that he is not a mere herd, at the beck and call of what has been dubbed the [...] "tyranny of the countryside."

40|$|Arabidopsis thaliana is {{now widely}} {{used as a}} model system in {{molecular}} and developmental biology, {{as well as in}} physiology and cell biology. However, ecologists and evolutionary biologists have turned their attention to the mouse ear cress only much more recently and almost reluctantly. The reason for this is the perception that A. thaliana is not particularly <b>interesting</b> ecologically <b>and</b> that it represents an oddity from an evolutionary standpoint. While there is some truth in both these attitudes, similar criticisms apply to other model systems such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which has been extensively studied from an organismal perspective. Furthermore, the shortcomings of A. thaliana in terms of its restricted ecological niche are counterbalanced by the wealth of information on the molecular and developmental biology of this species, which makes possible to address evolutionary questions that can rarely be pursued in other species. This chapter reviews the history of the use of A. thaliana in organismal biology and discusses some of the recent work and future perspectives of research on a variety of field including life history evolution, phenotypic plasticity, natural selection and quantitative genetics. I suggest that the future of both molecular and especially organismal biology lies into expanding our knowledge from limited and idiosyncratic model systems to their phylogenetic neighborhood, which is bound to be more <b>varied</b> <b>and</b> biologically <b>interesting...</b>|$|R

The narratives revealed barriers the students had to overcome in order to fulfill their goals and the way they explored their own interests to discover their strengths. Student narratives revealed leaders and mentors that contributed to their success these people varied from friends to family and many other community and school-based people. The academic and social success of these students <b>varied</b> <b>and</b> created <b>interesting</b> stories that may inform the development of programs to support Aboriginal youth. The school that participated in the study has a process that encourages Aboriginal students to succeed although that process is not thoroughly examined the student stories reveal the success of the process along with other family and community influences. A common thread throughout these stories is competency. Although these students appeared to have little access to culturally responsive teaching, the common foundation of their success was skill development in an area they were proud of and that contributed to a goal for post-secondary achievement.
