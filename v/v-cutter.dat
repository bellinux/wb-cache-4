To make new screws and nuts you need two tools, a screwbox to make the external threads and a tap to make the internal threads in the nut. The screwbox is a nut with internal threads where a v-shaped cutter has been placed in a precise position so that the external threads will go with the internal threads. In this essay details of great importance to obtain a well function screw are examined. Yellow birch has been used for the screws and nuts. Screwboxes with only one cutter has been examined and used. Details concerning the features of the tap have not been examined further. Ten screws of different age and eleven old screwboxes have been examined. The screwboxes have been drawn in scale 1 : 1. A test showing what importance the wood of the screw has to the result of the screw has been made. One old screwbox has been renovated and one has been made from pieces of birch and with a <b>v-cutter</b> from an old screwbox in order to detect details that affect the result of the screw.

50|$|The last of {{the most}} common type of cuts is the V-cut. <b>V-cutters</b> look like {{guillotine}} cutters, but cut a wedge into the cigar cap rather than completely removing it, creating a clean-looking gash. Good <b>V-cutters</b> penetrate deeper into the filler than straight cutters, and some smokers prefer them for thicker gauge cigars. However, cheap <b>V-cutters</b> can result in sloppy cuts too deep into the cigar, which result in an uneven burn.|$|R
