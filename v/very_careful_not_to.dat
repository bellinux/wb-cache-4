As his fame grew, so did his access to the finer things in life usually denied to African-Americans, even famous ones. It was a power and privilege that he enjoyed, although he was <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> flaunt it with fellow performers of color, and privately, he shared what access that he could with friends and fellow musicians.|$|E

500|$|Interest in the Galileo {{affair was}} revived {{in the early}} 19th century, when Protestant polemicists used it (and other {{events such as the}} Spanish Inquisition and the myth of the flat Earth) to attack Roman Catholicism. Interest in it has waxed and waned ever since. In 1939, Pope Pius XII, in his first speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, within a few months of his {{election}} to the papacy, described Galileo as being among the [...] "most audacious heroes of research... not afraid of the stumbling blocks and the risks on the way, nor fearful of the funereal monuments". His close advisor of 40 years, Professor Robert Leiber, wrote: [...] "Pius XII was <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> close any doors (to science) prematurely. He was energetic on this point and regretted {{that in the case of}} Galileo." ...|$|E

500|$|From early childhood, Shackleton was a {{voracious}} reader, a pursuit which {{sparked a}} passion for adventure. He was schooled by a governess {{until the age of}} eleven, when he began at Fir Lodge Preparatory School in West Hill, Dulwich, in southeast London. At the age of thirteen, he entered Dulwich College. The young Shackleton did not particularly distinguish himself as a scholar, and was said to be [...] "bored" [...] by his studies. He was quoted later as saying: [...] "I never learned much geography at school... Literature, too, consisted in the dissection, the parsing, the analysing of certain passages from our great poets and prose-writers... teachers should be <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> spoil [...] taste for poetry for all time by making it a task and an imposition." [...] In his final term at the school he was still able to achieve fifth place in his class of thirty-one.|$|E
500|$|On {{the first}} day only 7,669 Allied {{soldiers}} were evacuated, {{but by the end}} of the eighth day, 338,226 of them had been rescued by a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 boats. Many troops were able to embark from the harbour's protective mole onto 39 British Royal Navy destroyer, 4 Royal Canadian Navy destroyers, and a variety of civilian merchant ships, while others had to wade out from the beaches, waiting for hours in shoulder-deep water. Some were ferried to the larger ships by what came to be known as the little ships of Dunkirk, a flotilla of hundreds of merchant marine boats, fishing boats, pleasure craft, yachts, and lifeboats called into service from Britain. The BEF lost 68,000 soldiers during the French campaign and had to abandon nearly all of its tanks, vehicles, and equipment. In his speech to the House of Commons on 4 June, Churchill reminded the country that [...] "we must be <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory.

500|$|He was <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{present his}} own {{views of the}} meaning of his films and leave them open to interpretation. He {{explained}} in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, {{what is it that you}} were trying to say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what T. S. Eliot said to someone who had asked him—I believe it was The Waste Land—what he meant by the poem. He replied, 'I meant what I said'. If I could have said it any differently, I would have". Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can both be appreciated by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual in the way that his films can because their [...] "emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction evoked by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, and was one of the reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound. In a Time magazine interview in 1975, Kubrick further stated: [...] "The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When you say something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves." [...] He also said [...] "Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious".|$|E

The greater part of Africa and Asia has never even been traversed yet by a trained observer interested in these matters and free to explore, and we must be <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> therefore <b>not</b> <b>to</b> conclude that the early true men were distinctively inhabitants of western Europe or that they first appeared in that region.|$|R

It is odd that a thing which I {{have been taught}} to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should {{in a time of}} loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count Dracula, as it may help me to understand.

5000|$|One {{concern among}} {{scientists}} in the film was the connection between hurricanes and global warming, which remains contentious in the science community. Gore cited five recent scientific studies to support his view. [...] "I thought the use of imagery from Hurricane Katrina was inappropriate and unnecessary in this regard, as {{there are plenty of}} disturbing impacts associated with global warming for which there is much greater scientific consensus," [...] said Brian Soden, professor of meteorology and oceanography at the University of Miami.Gavin Schmidt, climate modeler for NASA, thought Gore appropriately addressed the issue."Gore talked about 2005 and 2004 being very strong seasons, and if you weren't paying attention, you could be left with the impression that there was a direct cause and effect, but he was <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> say there's a direct correlation," [...] Schmidt said.

5000|$|Hardly anybody remembers this Dutch Brigade nowadays. Its namesake, the Dutch Brigade, {{formed by}} the Kingdom of Holland to fight on the French side under general Chassé in the Peninsular War is {{actually}} better known. Nevertheless, the Brigade has some historiographical significance, if only in the controverse that has long surrounded {{the era of the}} Batavian Republic and the Kingdom of Holland, or what Orangist historians, both 19th century and modern, prefer to call the Franse tijd ("French Era") in Dutch history and historiography. Contemporary tempers clearly flared, as De Bas notes, when he writes that the Dutch daily newspaper Haagsche Courant called the troops of the Brigade lichtmissen (rakes), ploerten (cads), and [...] "...all kinds of deserters, among whom many Germans, but also many Dutchmen ... who emptied many a keg of Porter beer," [...] though he adds that the newspaper admitted that they looked fine in their uniforms. Indeed, the Brigade was viewed with some trepidation in the Batavian Republic, because it was suspected that it was primarily intended to serve in a future invasion of the Netherlands, as indeed it was. The fact that [...] "Dutch soldiers" [...] in foreign service might again fight against their compatriots on Dutch soil (as in the Helder Expedition) could be expected to generate bad feelings. And such contemporary feelings toward the Brigade and its leadership could easily carry over into historiography. This is something to consider when one reads different historical accounts of the period in question, especially if historical parallels are drawn, as they inevitably are, with other historical events. Captain Ringoir implicitly does this when {{at the end of his}} little monograph extensively cited above, he refers to the Dutch Brigade that was organised by the Dutch government-in-exile in British territory during the Second World War. Others make such comparisons explicitly. But this is very dangerous, as the analogies are mostly false: the First French Republic was not Nazi Germany; the Patriots were not the N.S.B; stadtholder William V was not Queen Wilhelmina; and the Hereditary Prince was not Prince Bernhard, the commander of the Dutch armed forces in exile; nor the Dutch Brigade the Princess Irene Brigade. All such easy analogies are false and misleading, as are the opposite comparisons of the Dutch Brigades (both [...] "French" [...] and [...] "British") with the Dutch volunteers that enlisted in the Waffen-SS on the Eastern Front. One should be <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> even hint at such comparisons, as the British historian Simon Schama, an expert on the period of the Batavian Republic/"French Era" [...] has pointed out, following the Dutch historian Pieter Geyl, who also warned against this fallacy.|$|R

I never did see why I have to throw in a plot, too.” [...] In an earlier (1977) interview, she stated that “the real joy of writing is how people can surprise one. My people wander around my study until the novel is done. It’s one reason I’m <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> write about people I don’t like. If I find somebody creeping in that I’m not really fond of, I usually take him out.” [...] Pollitt had even earlier noted how Tyler’s characters seem {{to take on a}} life of their own that she doesn’t seem to totally control: “Her complex, crotchety inventions surprise us, but one senses they surprise her too.” ...|$|E

[...] "We must apologize to the others for our being four under one roof", {{she was in the}} habit of remarking. [...] "When I am dead, you must be <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> lead a family life with one another...I did not come to Carmel to be with my sisters; on the contrary, I saw clearly that their presence would cost me dear, for I was determined not to give way to nature." ...|$|E
2500|$|Albini's lyrics drew {{criticism}} for apparent racism and homophobia. Racism {{was a frequent}} theme in Big Black songs, influenced partly by the sharp racial divisions present in Chicago at the time. The word [...] "darkie" [...] appeared in {{the first line of}} the Lungs EP, but Albini defended its use as a comical term, saying [...] "in a way that's a play on the concept of a hateful word. Can a word that's so inherently hilarious be hateful? I don't know." [...] He similarly defended his use of gay jokes and the word [...] "fag": [...] "Given how intermingled the gay and punk subcultures were, it was assumed by anyone involved that open-mindedness, if not free-form experimentation, was the norm. With that assumption under your belt, joke all you like. The word 'fag' isn't just a gay term, it's funny on its own — phonetically — like the words 'hockey puck,' 'mukluks,' 'gefilte fish,' and 'Canada. Some critics viewed these defenses as mere justifications for actual deep-seated racism, homophobia, and misogyny on Albini's part, given his level of familiarity with the subject matter, but he insisted that he was not a prejudiced person and was merely satirizing those impulses that rational, civilized persons normally suppress in the course of social interaction: [...] "So once that's given, once you know what you think, there's no reason to be ginger about what you say. A lot of people, they're <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> say things that might offend certain people or do anything that might be misinterpreted.
