40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the effect of air pressure to combustion properties of residual oil fuel and the air-fuel ratio. The heat energy resulted by the combustion is used for aluminium casting. The residual oil fuel combustion used <b>vaporizing</b> <b>burner,</b> with 4 variations of air pressure; 2, 3, 4 and 5 bars. The air pressure was supllied by air compressor. The fuel composition is 100...|$|E

40|$|Charcoal {{is one of}} {{the major}} energy sources for {{household}} applications in urban areas of developing countries. It is often made from natural forest and accelerates forest depletion. The aim of this work was to evaluate the use of jatropha oil for combustion in <b>vaporizing</b> <b>burners.</b> This paper presents laboratory tests on a burner whose nominal output is 7. 5 kW. The burner had to be modified because of the high viscosity of jatropha oil and for cold start, as the oil flash point is much higher than fuel oil flash point. Pollutants emissions and thermal performances are analyzed for three firing rates. The burner meets EN 1 standards at high firing rate. Unburned emissions are higher for middle and low firing rates.

The fuel was vaporized at high pressure and burned to heat the mantle, giving an output of over six times the luminosity of traditional oil lights. The use of gas as illuminant became widely available with {{the invention of the}} Dalén light by Swedish engineer, Gustaf Dalén. He used Agamassan (Aga), a substrate, to absorb the gas allowing safe storage and hence commercial exploitation. Dalén also invented the 'sun valve', which automatically regulated the light and turned it off during the daytime. The technology was the predominant form of light source in lighthouses from the 1900s through the 1960s, when electric lighting had become dominant.|$|R
50|$|South Foreland Lighthouse was {{the first}} tower to {{successfully}} use an electric light in 1875. The lighthouse's carbon arc lamps were powered by a steam-driven magneto. John Richardson Wigham {{was the first}} to develop a system for gas illumination of lighthouses. His improved gas 'crocus' burner at the Baily Lighthouse near Dublin was 13 times more powerful than the most brilliant light then known.The <b>vaporized</b> oil <b>burner</b> was invented in 1901 by Arthur Kitson, and improved by David Hood at Trinity House.

5000|$|The {{kerosene}} burning Primus stoves {{and their}} imitators {{were made of}} brass and were a significant advance over previous designs, which had used a wick to supply liquid fuel to the burner by capillary action. The Primus <b>burner</b> <b>vaporized</b> the fuel in a loop of pipe which rose up from the fuel tank at the stove's base, and which was pre-heated with alcohol (or [...] "methylated spirits") before being combusted in the burner. Initial pressure is provided by a small, hand operated pump integrated into the stove's fuel tank. The flame on a Primus stove is adjusted by using the pump to increase the pressure in the tank to make the flame larger, or by venting the tank to reduce the pressure and make the flame smaller. Later models used a separate valve to adjust the flame. Primus-style stoves were made {{in a variety of}} sizes and styles, and many were designed to be disassembled for storage and transportation in a separate case.|$|R
