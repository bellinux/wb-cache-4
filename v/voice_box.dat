5|$|Spoken {{language}} {{relies on}} human physical {{ability to produce}} sound, which is a longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the ear drum. This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the <b>voice</b> <b>box</b> (larynx), and the upper vocal tract– the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the {{different parts of the}} speech apparatus, the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.|$|E
5|$|At the SSR, Carter learns {{from the}} {{crippled}} war veteran Agent Daniel Sousa that the chauvinistic and promotion-seeking Agent Jack Thompson is following a lead on club owner Spider Raymond, {{who is looking}} to fence Stark's inventions. Raymond indeed sells the formula to the silent Leet Brannis. Infiltrating the club in disguise, Carter breaks into Raymond's safe and discovers that the formula has already {{been turned into a}} weapon. By the time Thompson gets there, Raymond is dead, killed by a man in a green suit, who follows Carter back to her apartment and kills her roommate. Carter pushes him out a window, and notices that he has a scar on his neck where his <b>voice</b> <b>box</b> once was. After attempting to comfort her, Stark's butler Edwin Jarvis takes Carter to see Dr. Anton Vanko at Stark Industries, who deduces that the weapon was created at a Roxxon Oil refinery.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{surgeons}} recommended {{an eight-hour}} procedure {{to remove the}} tumours; however, their size and proximity to his <b>voice</b> <b>box</b> eventually persuaded them to recommend radiotherapy, of which Boycott had 35 sessions from 22 October. By December, scans revealed {{that the majority of}} the tumours had disappeared, and the final tumour's disappearance was confirmed in early 2003. Although initially reluctant to discuss his health with the public, he spoke privately with his daughter, Emma, and then released a statement publicly, which evoked a significant emotional response. On 16 August 2003, he was given his own standing ovation by the crowd at Trent Bridge as he and a number of other cricketers did a lap of the ground in vehicles to celebrate Trent Bridge's 50th Test match.|$|E

5|$|According to Twain, {{she became}} {{depressed}} and lost {{her desire to}} live after the divorce. As a distraction, she began to write a memoir, titled From This Moment On after the 1998 song of the same name. She then re-evaluated her life and noted a pattern of withholding emotions, which affected her voice for both speaking and singing. She explained {{the loss of her}} voice resulted from the cumulative stress of experiencing domestic violence in her childhood, the death of her parents, stress from her musical career, and the divorce. As a result, the singer developed dysphonia, an impairment in the ability to produce sound because of tightened muscles enveloping her <b>voice</b> <b>box.</b> In order to recover, Twain embarked on a documented journey with the series Why Not? with Shania Twain. Twain's wanted go outside her comfort zone and perform once again, while inspiring viewers to be proactive about their own problems.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its size}} and gaudy coloration, this vulture is quite {{inconspicuous}} when it is perched in trees. While perched, it holds its head lowered and thrust forward. It is non-migratory and, unlike the turkey, lesser yellow-headed and American black vulture, it generally lives alone or in small family groups. Groups of up to 12 birds have been observed bathing and drinking in a pool above a waterfall in Belize. One or two birds generally descend to feed at a carcass, although occasionally up to ten or so may gather if there is significant amount of food. King vultures have lived up to 30 years in captivity, though their lifespan in the wild is unknown. This vulture uses urohidrosis, defecating on its legs, to lower its body temperature. Despite its bill and large size, it is relatively unaggressive at a kill. The king vulture lacks a <b>voice</b> <b>box,</b> although it can make low croaking noises and wheezing sounds in courtship, and bill-snapping noises when threatened. Its only natural predators are snakes, which will prey upon the vulture's eggs and young, and large cats such as jaguars, which may surprise and kill an adult vulture at a carcass.|$|E

25|$|The {{epiglottis}} {{is one of}} nine cartilaginous {{structures that}} make up the larynx (<b>voice</b> <b>box).</b> During breathing, it lies completely within the larynx. During swallowing, it serves as part of the anterior of the pharynx.|$|E
25|$|Laryngeal {{dystonia}} or spasmodic dysphonia {{results from}} abnormal contraction of {{muscles in the}} <b>voice</b> <b>box,</b> resulting in altered voice production. Patients may have a strained-strangled quality to their voice or, in some cases, a whispering or breathy quality.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversial}} {{surgical procedure}} known as 'debarking' is a veterinary procedure for modifying the <b>voice</b> <b>box</b> {{so that a}} barking dog will make a significantly reduced noise. It is considered a last resort by some owners, {{on the basis that}} it is better than euthanasia, seizure, or legal problems if the matter has proven incapable of being reliably corrected any other way.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{successful}} early {{project was}} the [...] "Barbie Liberation Organization," [...] where Vamos {{and his cohorts}} purchased three hundred Barbie and G.I. Joe dolls, exchanged their electronic <b>voice</b> <b>boxes,</b> and then returned them to the stores; the soldiers ended up saying things like [...] "Let's go shopping!", while the Barbies exclaimed [...] "Vengeance is mine!". It was a small-scale project and few people actually found themselves in possession of the switched dolls, but the stunt nevertheless attracted national media attention.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993, to draw {{attention}} to what they regarded as outdated gender stereotypes exemplified by the dolls, a group of East Village performance artists calling themselves the Barbie Liberation Organization orchestrated an exchange of <b>voice</b> <b>boxes</b> between 300 Teen Talk Barbies and Hasbro Talking Duke G.I. Joe action figures, which were replaced on store shelves. Affected Teen Talk Barbies spoke phrases such as [...] "Eat lead, Cobra!", [...] "Attack!", and [...] "Vengeance is mine!" [...] They were found in stores in New York and California.|$|R

25|$|In 2017, it {{was shown}} that modern humans have gone through {{particularly}} extensive DNA methylation changes in the <b>voice</b> <b>box</b> (larynx) genes while no such changes have been observed in the Neanderthal or in the Denisovan. This study suggested that the human vocal apparatus, previously shown to be optimal for speech, has gone through vast morphological changes after the split from archaic humans, and could thus be unique to modern humans.|$|E
25|$|CO2 {{laser surgery}} is also {{another form of}} treatment. Transoral laser {{microsurgery}} allows surgeons to remove tumors from the <b>voice</b> <b>box</b> with no external incisions. It also allows access to tumors that are not reachable with robotic surgery. During the surgery, surgeon and pathologist work together to assess the adequacy of excision (“margin status”), minimizing the amount of normal tissue removed or damaged. This technique helps give the person as much speech and swallowing function as possible after surgery.|$|E
25|$|The larynx or <b>voice</b> <b>box</b> is {{an organ}} {{in the neck}} housing the vocal folds, which are {{responsible}} for phonation. In humans, the larynx is descended. Our species is not unique in this respect: goats, dogs, pigs and tamarins lower the larynx temporarily, to emit loud calls. Several deer species have a permanently lowered larynx, which may be lowered still further by males during their roaring displays. Lions, jaguars, cheetahs and domestic cats also do this. However, laryngeal descent in nonhumans (according to Philip Lieberman) is not accompanied by descent of the hyoid; hence the tongue remains horizontal in the oral cavity, preventing it from acting as a pharyngeal articulator.|$|E
5000|$|Giants are humans. They have {{machines}} that work by themselves, great big {{pieces of metal}} that smell bad and take them where they want, great strength, loud <b>voices,</b> <b>boxes</b> that release sound, and objects which they use to fire stone-like round things that can hurt or kill. The Lymen and the Dorig fear them, but the humans are unaware of the Lymen and Dorig. They wear many-coloured clothes with much decoration that fasten in [...] "mysterious ways" [...] (zippers). Their Power comes from the Earth, the New Power.|$|R
5000|$|Tui are {{considered}} to be very intelligent, much like parrots. They also resemble parrots in their ability to clearly imitate human speech, and were trained by Māori to replicate complex speech. Tui are also known for their noisy, unusual call, different for each individual, that combine bellbird-like notes with clicks, cackles, timber-like creaks and groans, and wheezing sounds. Songbirds have two <b>voice</b> <b>boxes</b> (syrinxes) [...] and this is what enables them to perform such a myriad of vocalisations. Tui song also exhibits geographical, microgeographic, seasonal, sex and individual variation.|$|R
5000|$|The Barbie Liberation Organization or BLO, {{sponsored}} by RTMark, are {{a group of}} artists and activists involved in culture jamming. They gained notoriety in 1993 by switching the <b>voice</b> <b>boxes</b> on talking G.I. Joes and Barbie dolls. The BLO performed [...] "surgery" [...] on a reported 300-500 dolls and then returned them to the shelves of stores, an action they refer to as shopgiving. This action resulted in girls opening their new Teen Talk Barbie to hear it say phrases such as [...] "vengeance is mine" [...] and boys hearing their G.I. Joe say [...] "The beach is the place for summer." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of diphtheria usually begin two {{to seven days}} after infection. Symptoms of diphtheria include fever of 38°C (100.4°F) or above, chills, fatigue, bluish skin coloration (cyanosis), sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, foul-smelling and bloodstained nasal discharge, and lymphadenopathy. Within two to three days, diphtheria may destroy healthy tissues in the respiratory system. The dead tissue forms a thick, gray coating that can build up in the throat or nose. This thick gray coating is called a “pseudomembrane.” It can cover tissues in the nose, tonsils, <b>voice</b> <b>box,</b> and throat, making {{it very hard to}} breathe and swallow. Symptoms can also include cardiac arrhythmias, myocarditis, and cranial and peripheral nerve palsies.|$|E
25|$|With the U.S. Army's {{approval}} of the Shure T-17 microphone for use during World War II, Shure began producing what would be several specialized microphones for U.S. military use during that war. Shure's adoption of the Military Standard Specification, and product redesigns intended to conserve raw materials essential to the war effort, positioned the company to fulfill the military's needs for specialized microphones. The T-17 Battle Announce Microphone was {{the most widely used}} microphone in the U.S. Army and Air Force during World War II, and featured a plastic case that conserved aluminum and lighter and more reliable {{in a wide range of}} temperatures and climates. A waterproof version was used on nearly all U.S. Navy ships. Shure also designed the T-30 Throat Microphone for flight crews. A cloth strap held the T-30 against the throat, capturing the user's <b>voice</b> <b>box</b> vibrations directly and avoiding the background noise of the airplane. Shure also manufactured specialized headsets and the MC-1 oxygen mask microphone. In yet another example of the widespread use of Shure microphones by the U.S. military, U.S. lookout Private Lockhard used a Shure 700A microphone to announce his sighting of Japanese planes approaching Pearl Harbor on the morning of On December 7, 1941.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), like {{nandrolone}} (as an ester like nandrolone decanoate or nandrolone phenylpropionate), are agonists of the {{androgen receptor}} (AR) similarly to testosterone {{but are not}} usually used in HRT for transgender men or for androgen replacement therapy (ART) in cisgender men. However, {{they can be used}} in place of testosterone with similar effects, and can have certain advantages like less or no local potentiation in so-called androgenic tissues that express 5α-reductase like the skin and hair follicles (which results in a reduced rate of skin and hair-related side effects like acne, oily skin, seborrhea, excessive body hair growth, and, in particular, male-pattern baldness), although this can also be disadvantageous in a few aspects of masculinization (specifically facial hair growth, body hair growth, and clitoral enlargement). Although many AAS are not potentiated in androgenic tissues, they have similar effects to testosterone in other tissues like bone, muscle, fat, and the <b>voice</b> <b>box.</b> Also, many AAS, like nandrolone esters, are aromatized into estrogens to a greatly reduced extent relative to testosterone or not at all, and for this reason, are associated with reduced or no estrogenic effects (e.g., gynecomastia). AAS that are 17α-alkylated like methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, and stanozolol are orally active but carry a high risk of liver damage, whereas AAS that are not 17α-alkylated, like nandrolone esters, must be administered by intramuscular injection (via which they act as long-lasting depots similarly to testosterone esters) but have no more risk of liver damage than does testosterone.|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{detailed}} description of the complex [...] "surgery" [...] they performed available on their website, encouraging others to take part in the surgeries themselves. The surgery required some technical skills, tools and precision, but the <b>voice</b> <b>boxes</b> in the dolls were similar enough that the surgery could be reproduced fairly easily in other parts of the country. They outlined the surgery in easy to understand images. After the surgery they would secretly return the toys to shelves, what they call reverse shoplifting. Therefore, the store makes money twice and everything they did was perfectly legal.|$|R

Brannis drops one of the bombs, giving Carter 30 seconds to escape, and the subsequent implosion destroys the building. Carter and Jarvis get away safely, as does Brannis with a truck full of nitramene bombs. Later, Jarvis calls Stark to assure him that Carter is an excellent choice.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Scuzzlebutt, [...] "Volcano" [...] included the first appearances of recurring characters Randy Marsh and Ned Gerblanski. In this first appearance, Randy is identified {{only as the}} South Park geologist, {{and it is only}} in the episode [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig" [...] that he is first introduced as Stan's father. Parker, who provides the voice of Randy Marsh, said the design, voice, and personality of the character are based on his real-life father, who works as a geologist for the United States Geological Survey. Parker said his father is very calm in real life and Randy's relaxed reaction to learning of the volcano—calmly sipping his coffee—is [...] "about how my dad would react to anything". The look of the Ned character was based on a drawing Parker made in high school, although the character did not originally have a <b>voice</b> <b>box.</b> The voice was inspired by a waitress who worked at a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Boulder, Colorado, where Parker and Stone would visit while attending the University of Colorado. The duo said they would go to the restaurant just to hear her voice, but that it was so low they would lose their appetite when she took their orders. Stone and Parker had trouble creating the right voice for the character; they tried putting the microphone directly on their throat, and also bought an actual <b>voice</b> <b>box,</b> but ultimately decided that the best way to provide the character's voice was with natural voice simulation.|$|E
