5000|$|Andrea and {{her mother}} arrive at the race <b>venue</b> and <b>register</b> under her brother's name, [...] "Andi". In spite of her initial confidence, Andrea learns {{the hard way that}} {{competition}} is fierce, and finishes last in her first race. Thinking that Andrea is a guy, competitor Dean Talon (Riley Smith) takes notice when the [...] "lapper" [...] garners the attention of several young women, finding it unbelievable that a 125 rider is getting looks. Dean, knowing that [...] "Andrew" [...] needs help with riding, offers to help the rookie in exchange for advice on his crush, Faryn Henderson (Katherine Ellis).|$|R
5000|$|The Oriental Theater, {{listed on}} the National Register of Historic Places in Colorado, is located in [...] Denver's Berkeley neighborhood.

Despite these prominent sports <b>venues,</b> workless claimants, <b>registered</b> jobseekers, were in November 2012 {{higher than the national}} average of 3.8%, at 4.7% of the population based on a statistical compilation by The Guardian, which was close to the Greater Manchester and Merseyside average but higher than the regional average of 4.4%. With the exception of the Conservative area of Rainford, virtually every other ward in the seat is safely Labour.|$|R
40|$|In 2000, the NSW Government legislated for {{gambling}} <b>venues,</b> including <b>registered</b> clubs, {{to implement}} certain responsible gambling measures. Many clubs also have introduced some voluntary strategies, including those {{contained in the}} Clubsafe program developed by Clubs NSW. However, no evidence exists that such measures are effective in minimising harm and protecting consumers in gambling. This paper reports on a 2002 - 2003 research project, funded by the NSW Casino Community Benefit Fund, which sought to address this gap in knowledge. It surveyed members from ten large Sydney clubs to assess their level of awareness of their clubs’ responsible gambling measures, how adequate they consider these measures to be, and whether these measures have changed their gambling behaviour in terms of frequency, expenditure and gambling session length. Comparisons are drawn between ‘problem’ and ‘recreational’ gamblers to inform a more grounded approach to responsible conduct of gambling, one that is better targeted at those most at risk of gambling-related harm...|$|R
5000|$|On 21 April 2008, a South African {{member of}} the Southern African Development Community (SADC) {{observer}} team, MP Dianne Kohler-Barnard, said that the recount was [...] "fatally flawed". She reported repeated miscommunication of <b>venue</b> addresses, protocol <b>registers</b> at several counting stations missing, ballot box seals holding the keys for the two padlocks on each box broken. One set of ballot boxes was missing a book of voting papers from the presidential election box, although all the other books were locked inside. Loose ballot box seals with serial numbers identical to those on already-sealed boxes were easily available.|$|R

40|$|The opioid {{overdose}} epidemic {{continues to}} escalate in the United States. Some of the {{morbidity and mortality}} associated with opioid overdose can be prevented with the timely administration of naloxone, an opioid reversal agent. The literature emphasized that the emergency department (ED) <b>venue</b> and <b>registered</b> nurses are well positioned to screen and identify high risk individuals whether they present {{as a result of}} an overdose or for other medical reasons. The literature also pointed to the importance of providing naloxone to high risk individuals and those who would be most likely to be at the scene of an overdose. This is critical because most overdoses occur at home. Additionally, negative attitudes and stigmatization towards individuals with substance use disorders (SUD) can result in provision of suboptimal patient care for this population. The literature demonstrated that education can improve knowledge gaps and negative attitudes towards patients with SUD. The purpose of this evidence-based practice improvement project (EBPI) was to address the knowledge gaps and attitudes of Emergency Department Registered Nurses (EDRNs) about the scope of the opioid overdose epidemic, SUDs as a disease, pathways from prescription opioids to heroin, treatment, recovery, harm reduction education, and nasal naloxone spray. The goal of the EBPI was to use evidence to increase the EDRNs’ knowledge and improve attitudes to facilitate delivery of evidence-based care...|$|R
5000|$|The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is {{responsible}} for regulating the dealing and trading of a much wider range of over-the-counter derivatives, including interest-rate swaps, commodity-linked swaps and certain FX, credit default swaps, and equity swaps. CFTC Commissioner Bart Chilton suggested that the primary benefits will be greater transparency, improved price formation, and better regulatory compliance. The CFTC's final SEF rules {{went into effect in}} August 2013 and the first SEFs began operating in October 2013. Previously operating swap trading platforms with multiple-to-multiple trading capability within the regulatory definition of [...] "swap execution facility" [...] could no longer operate legally without registering with the CFTC. [...] The SEF launch on October 2, 2013, was facilitated by a CFTC guidance letter and several conditional and time-limited grants of relief from enforcement against non-compliance with certain technical elements. However, the CFTC in its no-action letters did not grant relief for SEFs from the October 2, 2013 deadline requiring swap trading <b>venues</b> to <b>register.</b> The CFTC regulations further require SEF's to report certain data arising from the execution of a swap to a swap data depository either for real-time public dissemination or confidential regulatory use. Regulations require that if a swap is executed on a SEF, the SEF must provide written confirmation of the terms to each counterparty. After the CFTC certified Javelin Capital Markets SEF's Made Available to Trade (MAT) Submission on January 16, 2014, certain swaps were required to trade on SEFs as of February 15, 2014.|$|R

From here the customer can view extra details about the venue and then select one of their choice add a date and time and book it. Once the venue is booked the booking will appear in a calendar of bookings for the venue owners to view. They can see the date and time of the booking and the customer’s details should they need to contact them. As the bookings increase the venue owners will also be able to utilise a business intelligence dashboard that shows them the number of bookings per month.

It will also include a section that will provide advertising space for companies who provide products and services related to events such as balloons, entertainers and flowers. With this functionality planmyevent. eu provides a unique web service for booking and managing venues in Ireland...|$|R
40|$|Introduction (part) : In 2015, Just Festival celebrated 15 {{years of}} {{successful}} delivery {{of one of}} Edinburgh's most unique and diverse festivals featuring hundreds of events and performances in St. John's Church and engaging with thousands of audiences every August. The festival engages with broadly encompassing topical themes of social justice, equality, human rights, and cultural diversity, including prejudice against race, ethnicity, class and economic status. Previous editions have all provided a platform for local, national and international participants to share their talent, ideas, opinions and visions by engaging in music, dance, and theatre performances, conversation and talk discussions, exhibitions, film, family activities, and workshops. Every festival edition, performers are given the option of registering as part of Edinburgh Fringe programme besides being part of Just Festival since St. John's is a fringe <b>registered</b> <b>venue.</b> Just Festival is proud to have hosted for the past editions several socially conscious events that had strong positive impressions on audiences and created lively interactive debates. Although the 15 th edition of the festival has successfully led to {{a high number of}} new connections made as a result of cooperating with diverse community organizations and performers from various backgrounds, average paid attendance per event for that edition in particular was lower than expected due to expanding the programme offer into over 300 events which led to an overwhelming quantity for audiences to choose from, the inclusion of some events that were loosely connected to Just Festival's mission, and adding a second main venue besides St. John's {{for the first time that}} was not familiar to audiences as a fringe venue. Survey feedback gained from audiences and a thorough analysis of that edition's performance revealed those mentioned challenges, and that also depending on a different external temporary PR and Media consultant every season to handle the marketing for the festival is not ideal in such a competitive festivals month...|$|R
