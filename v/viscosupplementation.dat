METHODS: The databases of PubMed, Medline, EMbase and CINAHL were searched for English language full-text randomized controlled trials comparing intra-articular <b>viscosupplementation</b> alone or associated with physical and rehabilitative interventions to <b>viscosupplementation</b> alone, shame treatment, waiting lists, and any type of rehabilitative interventions. Methodological quality of each study was assessed by using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) Scale. RESULTS: A total of 115 references were retrieved, and 8 studies were selected. Three trials compared HA injection and physical therapy in knee OA, with disability and pain improvements in all studies, and between-group differences in favor of physical therapy in two studies; two trials compared HA injection and home exercises in knee OA, with improvements in pain, disability and quality of life in all studies, without between-group differences; two trials compared HA injection plus physical therapy agents and exercises to exercises plus physical therapy agents in knee OA, with improvements in disability and pain in both studies, and between-group differences in favor of the inclusion HA in one study; one trial compared HA injection and home exercises in ankle OA, with improvements in disability and pain in both arms without between-group differences.

40|$|Introduction: Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{a disease}} of {{synovial}} joints and {{is the most common}} cause of chronic pain. <b>Viscosupplementation</b> (VS) with hyaluronic acid (HA) is largely used for knee osteoarthritis therapy but the evidence for its usefulness in ankle osteoarthritis is limited. The objective of this review is to assess the efficacy of <b>viscosupplementation</b> treatment of ankle osteoarthritis in the current literature. Methods: The following databases were searched: Medline (period 2006 - 2008), Database of Abstract on Reviews and Effectiveness and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Reference lists of relevant articles were controlled for additional references. The search terms Review, <b>Viscosupplementation</b> (VS), Osteoarthritis (OA), Hyaluronic acid (HA), Hyaluronan, Sodium hyaluronate, Ankle OA, Ankle joint were used to identify all studies relating to the use of VS therapy for the ankle OA. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed by assigning level of evidence as previously defined by the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (CEBM). Result: Seven articles concerning the efficacy of a total of 275 patients undergoing VS treatment for ankle OA were included. One European study, one Taiwanese study, one Italian study, one Turkish study and three American studies with level of evidence ranging from I to IV evaluated the following products: Hyalgan ®, Synvisc ®, Supartz ®, Adant ®.

Notwithstanding the relatively low level of evidence in the trials, the authors concluded that <b>viscosupplementation</b> may be an alternative therapy for treating coxarthrosis. Intra-articular infiltration has proved to be safe and well-tolerated therapy. However, the authors state the need for trials on a larger number of people in order to avoid having to consider HA infiltration in the hip as an extremely selective choice that depends on the experience of the operator.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether <b>viscosupplementation</b> with intra-articular hyaluronic acid (HA) injections improves pain and function {{in patients with}} osteoarthritis (OA) in their knees. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Pre-MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases using the MeSH headings and key words osteoarthritis (knee) and hyaluronic acid. STUDY SELECTION: English-language case series and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected. Studies with biologic, histologic, or arthroscopic outcomes were excluded. SYNTHESIS: Five case series and 13 RCTs were critically appraised. Data from three case series and three RCTs using injections of high-molecular-weight HA (Synvisc) demonstrated significant improvement in pain, activity levels, and function. The beneficial effect started as early as 12 weeks. Studies using low-molecular-weight HA had conflicting results.

30|$|To {{overcome}} {{the problem of}} selectivity and operator-dependent approach to hip <b>viscosupplementation,</b> a clear identification {{of whether or not}} the patient is suitable for HA infiltration treatment in the hip is mandatory. Although studies of variability in the efficacy of HA infiltration therapy in the hip compared to the gravity of the hip arthritis have not yet been carried out, it can reasonably be assumed, as reported by knee <b>viscosupplementation</b> studies, that the possibilities of efficacy and duration of the beneficial effects of the treatment are inversely proportional to the gravity of the disease [15]. For this reason selection criteria for the candidate patient are vital to obtain pain relief in cases of hip arthritis. These selection criteria consist of hip pain for at least 3  weeks, X-ray proof of at least partially-preserved joint space, and good or full joint mobility. Hip <b>viscosupplementation</b> can be used as an alternative to or in combination with drugs for pain control. This type of approach to <b>viscosupplementation</b> therapy does not correspond to the inclusion criteria reported in Van den Bekerom and colleagues’ study [14]. Considering hyaluronic acid as a pain therapy, using its beneficial effects on cartilage due to both the pharmacological and the physical properties of the molecule [16 – 18], then the use of injection in cases of low or medium degrees of hip arthritis is mandatory. For this reason, patient candidates for hip arthroplasty were excluded for our study.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There {{are many}} non {{invasive}} treatment modalities for internal temporomandibular joint derangements {{described in the}} literature, including counseling, drug therapy, physical therapy and interocclusal devices.

40|$|International audienceOsteoarthritis (OA) {{leads to}} {{significant}} pain and disability. For pain relief, a tailored approach using non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapies is recommended. If adequate symptom relief is not achieved with acetaminophen, other pharmacological options include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), topical analgesics, intra-articular corticosteroids and intra-articular hyaluronic acid (HA) <b>viscosupplementation.</b> Most of these therapies {{generally do not}} improve functional ability or quality of life or are associated with tolerability concerns. In OA patients, concentration and molecular weight (MW) of HA are reduced, diminishing elastoviscosity of the synovial fluid, joint lubrication and shock absorbancy, and possibly anti-inflammatory, analgesic and chondroprotective effects. In knee OA, <b>viscosupplementation</b> with 3 - 5 weekly intra-articular HA injections diminishes pain and improves disability, generally within 1  week and for up to 3 - 6  months and is well tolerated. HAs have comparable efficacy as NSAIDs, with less gastrointestinal adverse events, and compared with intra-articular corticosteroids, benefits last generally longer. High MW hylans provide comparable benefits versus HA, albeit with {{an increased risk of}} immunogenic adverse events. In mild-to-moderate hip OA, intra-articular injection of HA moderately improved pain and function, generally for up to 3  months with no serious adverse events. Efficacy in other joints is being evaluated. <b>Viscosupplementation</b> with intra-articular Sinovial (other trade names: Yaral, Intragel) injections (an HA of low-medium MW) relieves pain and improves function in OA of the knee, and other joints including the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb and the shoulder.

40|$|The idea of {{this study}} was to combine hyaluronic acid (HA) <b>viscosupplementation</b> and a local/controlled {{delivery}} of a hydrophobic anti-inflammatory drug. To this aim, we investigated the ability of an octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) modified HA (OSA-HA), to act as a solubility enhancer and as a platform for slow release of hydrophobic drug(s). This novel HA derivative could act as a <b>viscosupplementation</b> agent and, for this reason, a rheological study was conducted along with calorimetric analysis. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results revealed that the ability of HA to sequester water is enhanced by the introduction of lipophilic functions within HA molecules, resulting in a decrease of the fraction of free water able to freeze compared to the unmodified HA. Moreover, OSA-HA solutions appear to be an appropriate tool to be used in <b>viscosupplementation</b> therapy owing to their suitable viscoelastic features. Our results indicate that OSA-HA is able to self-assemble into micelles, load a hydrophobic drug and release the active molecule with controlled kinetics. In particular, the analysis of release profiles showed that, in all cases, drug diffusion into the gel is faster compared to gel/drug dissolution, being the dissolution contribution more relevant as the OSA-HA concentration increases...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTreatment {{goals for}} knee {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) include preservation of mobility, control of pain, and delaying total knee replacement (TKR). ObjectiveTo estimate the cost-effectiveness of <b>viscosupplementation</b> (hylan G-F 20) alone compared with conventional supportive therapy (CST) {{in the treatment}} of knee OA in Colombia. MethodsMicrosimulation in patients with knee OA, modeling of clinical outcomes (disease progression, symptom improvement, TKR), and estimation of associated costs were performed (drugs, diagnostic tests, procedures, and hospitalizations). The probabilities for disease progression and clinical events were correlated with patients’ characteristics. Clinical outcome information was obtained from the literature. The costs were drawn from institutional databases from health maintenance organizations and the Colombian standard tariffs handbook (ISS 2001. Agreement No. 256 of 2001. Tariffs for the health promoter Social Security EPS-ISS. Social Insurance Board of Directors. December 19, 2001). Sensitivity analyses were performed for costs and transition probabilities. ResultsMonte-Carlo simulation for 1000 patients with knee OA showed that <b>viscosupplementation</b> with hylan G-F 20 delayed the occurrence of TKR by 3 years compared with CST. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index scores indicate improvement in symptoms and function with hylan G-F 20. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for <b>viscosupplementation</b> is dominant, with reduction of US $ 576 in treatment cost in favor of hylan G-F 20, with more cost-effectiveness per quality-adjusted life-year during the first 10 years of treatment compared with CST.

40|$|Background: Recently, {{intra-articular}} <b>viscosupplementation</b> with hyaluronate-derived products {{has gained}} popu-larity as a palliative modality {{for the treatment}} of osteoarthritis of the knee. Mild pain or swelling at the site of injection may occur in up to 20 % of patients, although severe local inflammation, warmth, and joint effusion are rare. We present a series of six cases in which granulomatous inflammation of the synovium was observed af-ter hyaluronate <b>viscosupplementation</b> of the knee. Methods: Six knees (five patients) treated with intra-articular Hylan G-F 20 <b>viscosupplementation</b> underwent a surgical procedure because of persistent symptoms. Routine histopathological evaluation, supplemented by alcian-blue staining and hyaluronidase digestion, was performed in each case. Results: Chronically inflamed synovium with areas of histiocytic and foreign-body giant-cell reaction was ob-served surrounding acellular, amorphous material. The material stained with alcian blue, a stain for hyalur-onate, which disappeared after hyaluronidase digestion. Conclusions: We believe that the injected hyaluronate (Hylan G-F 20) may have been responsible for the syno-vitis in our patients and thus may be a pathological cause of recalcitrant symptoms after such injection. It is not known whether the responsible pathological agent was the hyaluronate derivative, a contaminant of the purifica-tion process, or a component of the carrier substance.

40|$|Hip is a site very {{commonly}} {{affected by}} osteoarthritis and the intra-articular administration of hyaluronic acid {{in the management}} of osteoarthritic pain is increasingly used. However, the debate about its usefulness is still ongoing, as not all results of clinical trials confirm its effectiveness. In order to achieve the best outcome, clinical assessment and treatment choices should be based on subjective outcome, pathological and mechanical findings that should be integrated with qualitative analysis of human movement. After <b>viscosupplementation,</b> clinical trials often evaluate as endpoint subjective outcomes (i. e. pain visual analogic scale) and static imaging such as radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging. In our clinical practice we use gait analysis as part of rehabilitation protocol to measure performance, enhancement and changes of several biomechanical factors. Taking advantage of available resources (BTS Bioengineering gait analysis Elite System) we studied a patient’s gait after ultrasound guided hip injections for <b>viscosupplementation.</b> He showed an early clinical and biomechanical improvement during walking after a single intra articular injection of hyaluronic acid.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Viscosupplementation</b> with {{hyaluronic acid}} (HA) of osteoarthritic (OA) knee joints has a {{well-established}} {{positive effect on}} clinical symptoms. This effect, however, is only temporary and the working mechanism of HA injections is not clear. It was suggested that HA might have disease modifying properties because of its beneficial effect on cartilage sulphated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) content. Delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC) is a highly reproducible, non-invasive surrogate measure for sGAG content and hence composition of cartilage. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess whether improvement in cartilage structural composition is detected using dGEMRIC 14 weeks after 3 weekly injections with HA in patients with early-stage knee OA. Methods: In 20 early-stage knee OA patients (KLG I-II), 3 D dGEMRIC at 3 T was acquired before and 14 weeks after 3 weekly injections with HA. To evaluate patient symptoms, the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) and a numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain were recorded. To evaluate cartilage composition, six cartilage regions in the knee were analyzed on dGEMRIC. Outcomes of dGEMRIC, KOOS and NRS before and after HA were compared using paired t-testing. Since we performed multiple t-tests, we applied a Bonferroni-Holm correction to determine statistical significance for these analyses. Results: All KOOS subscales ('pain', 'symptoms', 'daily activities', 'sports' and 'quality of life') and the NRS pain improved significantly 14 weeks after <b>Viscosupplementation</b> with HA. Outcomes of dGEMRIC did not change significantly after HA compared to baseline in any of the cartilage regions analyzed in the knee. Conclusions: Our results confirm previous findings reported in the literature, showing persisting improvement in symptomatic outcome measures in early-stage knee OA patients 14 weeks after <b>Viscosupplementation.</b> Outcomes of dGEMRIC, however, did not change after <b>Viscosupplementation,</b> indicating no change in cartilage structural composition as an explanation for the improvement of clinical symptoms...|$|E
40|$|<b>Viscosupplementation</b> is a {{therapeutic}} approach for osteoarthritis treatment, where the synovial fluid,the natural lubricant of the joints, {{is replaced by}} viscoelastic solutions with rheological properties compa-rable or better than the starting material. This study presents {{the development of an}} innovative platformfor <b>viscosupplementation,</b> based on the optimization of polysaccharide-based colloidal hydrogel, aimingto reduce on-site enzyme degradation and enhance the possibility of hyaluronic acid substitution withalternative biomaterials. Catanionic vesicles are proposed as physical crosslinker that can guarantee theformation of a ‘soft’, tunable network, offering a dual-therapeutic approach: on the mechanical reliefperspective, {{as well as on the}} drug/gene delivery strategy. This research focuses on the fabrication andoptimization of colloidal networks, driven by the synergistic interaction among catanionic vesicles andcationic modified cellulose polymers. This study tests the hypothesis that cellulose-like polymers can bearranged into functional matrix, mimicking the mechanical properties of healthy synovial fluids...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim {{here was}} to {{evaluate}} the evidence that might support or refute the use of intra-articular <b>viscosupplementation</b> in treating patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthrosis. A {{review of the literature}} was conducted using the Medline, PubMed and Cochrane Controlled Trial Register databases and Cochrane database systematic reviews (Cochrane Library). Only studies presenting a high level of evidence were taken into consideration. This study included analysis on randomized clinical trials that included at least 100 patients in each intervention group, meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Two meta-analyses, five systematic reviews and six randomized clinical trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. In the light of the best evidence available so far, there is no consensus for indicating or even for contraindicating the use of intra-articular <b>viscosupplementation</b> among patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthrosis (level of evidence I and degree of recommendation A). Further studies with appropriate methodology are needed to elucidate this matter...|$|E
40|$|Osteoarthritis {{of the hip}} is a {{frequent}} joint disorder in adults aged 50 years and older. The management focuses on pain reduction, by means of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics, physical therapy and weight reduction. When these treatments fail, total hip replacement can be considered. <b>Viscosupplementation</b> is a local therapeutic approach with the objective to decrease pain and to improve joint mobility. The treatment consists of injecting hyaluronic acid or hyaluronate derivatives intra-articularly. Although this approach is frequently used in young sportive adults to avoid knee surgery, its use in the severe osteoarthritic hip is less well documented. Moreover the injection of the hip joint is more difficult than injection of the knee joint, and on another hand the general condition of the patients is often already compromised. In this article we present a literature review on the subject and report the results in 60 patients who received intra-articular <b>viscosupplementation</b> of the hip with the objective to delay total hip replacement surgery. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} chronic joint disorder worldwide, and is associated with significant pain and disability. Intra-articular (IA) hyaluronan/hylan (HA) is an established local therapeutic modality {{for the treatment of}} knee OA. The goal of therapy is to relieve the symptoms associated with inflammation and thereby reduce pain and disability. Objectives: As part of a Cochrane review of <b>viscosupplementation</b> in knee OA, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were reviewed to evaluate evidence for the efficacy of <b>viscosupplementation</b> with Hylan G-F 20 compared to placebo. Methods: Electronic searches were conducted of EMBASE, MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, Current Contents and CENTRAL. Human, RCTs involving Hylan G-F 20 compared to placebo, published prior to 1 Q 2004, were included. Trials were selected and data extracted by 2 independent reviewers. Methodological quality was assessed with the Jadad criteria by 2 reviewers. Data on OARSI core set measures were extracted. Weighted mean differences (WMD), based on unadjusted post-test scores, and 95...|$|E
