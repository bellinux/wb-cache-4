5|$|A 1999–2005 Australian police {{survey of}} detainees {{reported}} preliminary findings that self-reported users of benzodiazepines {{were less likely}} than non-user detainees to work full-time {{and more likely to}} receive government benefits, use methamphetamine or heroin, and be arrested or imprisoned. Benzodiazepines are sometimes used for criminal purposes; they serve to incapacitate a <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> cases of drug assisted rape or robbery.|$|E

5|$|Although immobilizing a <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> {{front of}} a gun before firing the cannon {{is by far the}} most {{reported}} method, a case from Istanbul in 1596 alleges that the victim was actually put into the gun and executed in that manner. Reports exist that attest that on occasion, people were fastened to rockets and blown into the air, this is said to have occurred for a Brahmin under Hyder Ali's reign (1761–1782), and also, in an 1800 treason case, in the Maratha Empire.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Repeat <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> the West report crimes {{more often}} than other <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> order to see the {{offender}} arrested and/or to stop what is happening. Repeat victims know or assume that the same offender(s) are victimising them again and again. Repeat victims contact the police with more demanding aims than other victims. The reporting patterns of repeat <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> the West resemble those of all <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> poorer countries. Like the <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> these countries, Western repeat victims are less inclined to report at all. This finding suggests that they are less certain that the police can satisfy their needs. Repeat <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> the West do not refrain from reporting because they consider their victimisation not serious enough. They {{are more likely than}} one-time victims to refrain because they feel the police could not or would not do anything to help them. In this respect, too, they resemble victims from poorer countries. Repeat victims are less often satisfied with the police response in all regions. The differences are most pronounced among victims from industrialised countries. The reduced level of satisfaction of repeat victims with overall police performance is rooted in negative personal experiences with the police.

40|$|This study {{experimentally}} {{examines the}} effects of participant sex, perpetrator sex, and severity of violence on perceptions of intimate partner violence (IPV) seriousness, sympathy toward the victim, and punishment preferences for the perpetrator. Participants (N = 449) {{were randomly assigned to}} a condition, exposed to a composite news story, and then completed a survey. Ratings of seriousness of IPV for stories with male perpetrators were significantly higher than ratings of seriousness for stories with female perpetrators. Men had significantly higher sympathy for female <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> any condition than for male <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> the weak or strong severity of violence conditions. Men’s sympathy for male <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> the fatal severity of violence condition did not differ from their sympathy for female victims. Women had the least sympathy for female <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> the weak severity condition and men in the weak or strong severity conditions. Women reported significantly higher sympathy for female <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> the strong and fatal severity of violence conditions. Women’s ratings of sympathy for male <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> the fatal severity of violence condition were statistically indistinguishable from any other group. Participants reported stronger punishment preferences for male perpetrators and this effect was magnified among men. Theoretical implications are presented with attention provided to practical considerations about support for public health services...|$|R

5|$|Ostrom {{suggested}} that Deinonychus could kick with the sickle claw {{to cut and}} slash at its prey. Some researchers even {{suggested that}} the talon was used to disembowel large ceratopsian dinosaurs. Other {{studies have suggested that}} the sickle claws were not used to slash but rather to deliver small stabs to the <b>victim.</b> <b>In</b> 2005, Manning and colleagues ran tests on a robotic replica that precisely matched the anatomy of Deinonychus and Velociraptor, and used hydraulic rams to make the robot strike a pig carcass. In these tests, the talons made only shallow punctures and could not cut or slash. The authors suggested that the talons would have been more effective in climbing than in dealing killing blows.|$|E
5|$|Real maggots {{were used}} during {{many of the}} scenes, which were {{described}} by Gillian Anderson as being the hardest animals to work with on the show. The show's special effects producers were unable to create a full body replica of the first <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> time, requiring him to lay on an autopsy table with makeup applied while the maggots were poured on to him. Rice was used {{in place of the}} maggots during some of the scenes. The car crash {{at the end of the}} entry was described by stunt coordinator Tony Morelli as the most harrowing action sequence during the show's third season. To give the episode a different look the producers applied a green palette to the film in post-production.|$|E
5|$|Song Ci {{also shared}} his opinion that having the accused suspect {{of the murder}} present at the autopsy of his <b>victim,</b> <b>in</b> close {{proximity}} to the grieving relatives of the deceased, was a very powerful psychological tool for the authorities to gain confessions. In the earliest known case of forensic entomology, a villager was hacked to death with a sickle, which led the local magistrate to assemble all the villagers in a town square to lay down their sickles in order for blow flies to gather around which sickle still had unseen remnants of the victim's blood; when it became apparent which sickle was used as the murder weapon, the confessing murderer was arrested on the spot.|$|E

50|$|NGOs {{expressed}} concern that the national referral mechanism was disproportionately focused on prosecuting trafficking offenders rather than assisting victims. The government significantly increased the number of identified victims during the reporting period: law enforcement officials identified 60 <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> 2009 and referred 22 of them to NGOs for assistance, compared with 34 victims identified and 20 referred for assistance in 2008. Foreign-funded NGOs assisted 26 <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> 2009, compared with 24 <b>victims</b> <b>in</b> 2008. <b>Victims</b> were encouraged to cooperate with law enforcement bodies; in 2009, all 60 victims assisted police with trafficking investigations.|$|R

5|$|After {{making her}} acting {{debut in the}} 2000 war film Refugee, Kapoor {{established}} herself in Hindi cinema with roles in the historical drama Aśoka, and the blockbuster melodrama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (both 2001). This initial success {{was followed by a}} series of commercial failures and repetitive roles, which garnered her negative reviews. The year 2004 marked a turning point for Kapoor when she played against type in the role of a sex worker in the drama Chameli. She subsequently earned wide critical recognition for her portrayal of a riot <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> the 2004 drama Dev and a character based on William Shakespeare's heroine Desdemona in the 2006 crime film Omkara. She went on to receive Filmfare Awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress for her performances in the 2007 romantic comedy Jab We Met and the 2010 drama We Are Family, respectively. Kapoor achieved further success by featuring as the female lead in two of India's top-grossing productions—the 2009 comedy-drama 3 Idiots and the 2015 social drama Bajrangi Bhaijaan—and received praise for her roles in the 2009 thriller Kurbaan and the 2012 drama Heroine.|$|E
5|$|The {{exact number}} of {{casualties}} is unknown. There are different numbers that each derive from different investigations that used different definitions of what a <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> this case should be. Therefore, the numbers are hardly comparable. On top of that, some results are published infrequently or investigations were ceased with a provisional number. There is also a publicly held controversy between two groups regarding the number of victims. The opponents are the Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August and the ZZF. The former's numbers are higher, as they include, according to ZZF's Hans-Hermann Hertle, victims with an unclear or unsure connection to the border regime. After the ZZF published its interim results in August 2006, Alexandra Hildebrandt of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft has accused them of withholding numbers to invoke a more positive picture of East Germany. She argues that the ZZF project was funded {{by a coalition of}} social democrats and leftists.|$|E

5|$|In The Simpsons twentieth {{episode of}} the twentieth season, Four Great Women and a Manicure is loosely based on Macbeth. In the third act of the episode, Marge embodies Lady Macbeth, an ambitious wife who is {{frustrated}} by everything around her. She not only has to clean the costumes worn by other actors, but is also frustrated {{over the fact that}} Homer doesn't have any interest in auditioning for lead roles and would rather play a tree. She convinces him to kill Sideshow Mel and he does to assume the lead role of Macbeth. When Marge learns that no one cares for Homer's lack of acting skills over Hibbert's and those with no lines, she forces him to kill off everyone else until he's the only actor left. The angry spirits visit her that night and she tries to pin the blame on Homer. They refuse to believe Marge by pointing out that they knew he was a <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> her devious plans and get their revenge on her by killing her in a fright induced heart attack. Even though Homer gives Marge's ghost a promising performance, he eventually frustrates her more by killing himself so he doesn't have to audition for more Shakespearean plays. This forces Marge to learn her lesson the hard way when she must spend eternity with a lazy and happy Homer.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} Fighter Command's need for {{units in the}} south of the country, No. 41 Squadron was redeployed to RAF Hornchurch in Essex on 3 September 1940. On 5 September, Lock flew as Red 2, {{positioned}} behind and protecting the Squadron's Leader. He shot down two Heinkel He 111s over the Thames Estuary. One of his victims crashed into a river, the other caught fire and its undercarriage fell down. Lock followed it down. He quickly realised his mistake—reducing height to pursue a damaged enemy put a pilot at risk from enemy fighters—but it was too late. A Messerschmitt Bf 109 attacked him and he sustained damage to his Spitfire and a wound to his leg. Lock immediately zoom-climbed. The Bf 109 attempted to follow but the pilot stalled and fell away. Lock reversed direction and dived. Waiting for the German fighter to come out of its dive he fired several short bursts and it exploded. Looking around he saw the second He 111 land in the English Channel, about ten miles from the first. Lock circled above the He 111 and noticing a boat he alerted the boat to its presence by flying over it and led the vessel to the crash site. As he left the scene he saw the crew surrendering to the occupants of the boat. On the way home he saw his first <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> the river, with a dingy nearby. A further Bf 109 was claimed destroyed on that date.|$|E
5|$|Jigsaw then leads Tapp to the asylum's crematorium, {{where he}} informs Tapp {{that some people}} {{actually}} desire his tests, much to Tapp's surprise. At the crematorium is Obi Tate, an arsonist who had put advertisements in the newspaper seeking for Jigsaw to test him. Tapp saves him from a burning furnace, but Obi is still frustrated {{because he wanted to}} survive his own test. Feeling that Tapp is throwing away a gift from Jigsaw, Obi runs away. Tapp then ventures through a theater, where he finds evidence that a former Jigsaw victim being held there. He soon finds that it is Jeff Thomas, the man who was saved by Sing while he and Tapp were in Jigsaw's lair. Jeff has since become suicidal from Tapp's incessant questioning, and has been recaptured by Jigsaw. Tapp saves Thomas from a wall of spikes. Thomas is still frustrated, so he runs away, wounded. As this was the last <b>victim</b> <b>in</b> the asylum, Tapp is free to pursue Jigsaw, but encounters Pighead again. Jigsaw informs Tapp that Pighead wishes to surpass Jigsaw and sabotage Tapp's game, so he must be stopped. Tapp confronts and kills Pighead; Jigsaw rhetorically asks him if he's a murderer, {{in order to get a}} key to proceed.|$|E
