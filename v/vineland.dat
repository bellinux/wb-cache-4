5|$|Due to the April 2007 Nor'easter, the Rainbow Lake Bridge in Pittsgrove Township {{was washed}} {{out and the}} New Jersey Department of Transportation had {{to replace it with}} a new bridge. This closure led to detours for traffic {{traveling}} between <b>Vineland</b> and Bridgeton. The new Rainbow Lake Bridge was opened in November 2007. The bridge spanning the Maurice River, which connects <b>Vineland</b> and Pittsgrove Township, was closed in July 2007 for planned repairs. This bridge replacement, which was completed in December 2007, cost $5 million and provided a wider and higher crossing of the river.|$|E

5|$|Route 56 heads {{through a}} mix of farms and woodland, passing {{to the south of}} Rainbow Lake. Past the lake, the road turns to the east and {{continues}} into agricultural areas and intersects CR 655. Traveling eastward, the road crosses CR 638 and a Winchester and Western Railroad line. The route heads into forested areas, where it passes over the Maurice River into <b>Vineland</b> in Cumberland County. Here, it widens into a four-lane divided highway and comes to a cloverleaf interchange with Route 55. Past this interchange, Route 56 becomes a four-lane undivided road that is locally maintained. The route heads through commercial sectors of <b>Vineland</b> before coming to a crossroads with CR 628. The route continues past more inhabited areas and businesses before reaching its end at Route 47 (Delsea Drive). From here, Landis Avenue continues to the east toward the downtown area of <b>Vineland.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{portion of}} current Route 56 in <b>Vineland</b> was {{built as a}} 100-foot (30 m) wide road when <b>Vineland</b> was planned in the 1860s, serving as the main east–west road through the community. In the past, the Route 56 number was used twice for a never-built road between the Laurelton Circle and Mantoloking in Ocean County legislated in 1938 and for the portion of U.S. Route 30 between current Route 157 and Atlantic City between 1938 and 1953. The current {{iteration}} of Route 56 was legislated in 1977 to run from Route 77 north of Bridgeton to Route 47 in <b>Vineland,</b> replacing County Route 22 between Route 77 and the Salem County border, County Route 6 within Salem County, and County Route 23 between the Salem County border and Route 47. This portion of road was designated as Route 56 by the 1990s. In 2007, two bridges along the route were replaced. The Rainbow Lake Bridge in Pittsgrove Township was rebuilt after it was washed out by the April 2007 Nor'easter while the Maurice River bridge was reconstructed to make it wider and higher.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} {{small proportion of}} total membership comes from Canada. A growing portion of the Canadian demographic {{is made up of}} immigrant members of the church. This is partly the result of Canadian demographics as a whole, and partly due to decreased interest amongst late generation Canadians. The largest concentration of active congregations in Canada are in Southern Ontario, with notable congregations gathering in Beamsville, Bramalea, Niagara Falls, <b>Vineland,</b> Toronto (several), and Waterloo. Although many congregations of various sizes (typically under 300 members) meet all across Canada.|$|E
5|$|Moshe Malul {{pleaded guilty}} to a charge of {{racketeering}} conspiracy, admitting to conspiracy to commit murder and conspiracy to import the drug Ecstasy to the U.S. In his plea agreement, he acknowledged {{that as part of}} the Abergil crime family, he hired members of the <b>Vineland</b> Boyz street gang based in North Hollywood, to kill Sami Atias in retaliation for stealing Ecstasy that belonged to the Abergil organization. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison on June 21, 2012 with credit for time served. He was also ordered to serve three years under supervised release after his release from federal prison.|$|E
5|$|Route55 {{continues}} between {{rural areas}} near the Maurice River {{to the west}} and development to the east, coming to a cloverleaf interchange with Route56. Past this interchange, the route passes over a Winchester & Western Railroad line before crossing over CR540. Farther north, a modified cloverleaf interchange serves CR674 (Garden Road), which provides access to the northern part of <b>Vineland.</b> Past the Garden Road interchange, Route55 continues through farmland and woodland, passing to the east of Rudys Airport. The freeway crosses Scotland Run and briefly runs through Pittsgrove Township in Salem County.|$|E
5|$|On August 31, 2003, Sami Atias, an Israeli {{drug dealer}} who {{had belonged to}} an ecstasy ring headed by Abergil and Moshe Malul, was shot at close range and killed {{in the parking lot}} of an Encino café as he was getting into his car. Allegedly he had tried to steal 76 {{kilograms}} of Ecstasy in 2002. According to the indictment, Moshe Malul and fugitive <b>Vineland</b> Boyz′ member Luis Sandoval, were at the scene when Atias was shot, but another man had pulled the trigger. Itzhak Abergil had offered to help with the slaying during a meeting in Spain, but he did not play a direct role in the killing.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Lincoln, the QEW travels {{along the}} Lake Ontario {{shoreline}} through the Niagara Fruit Belt; numerous wineries line {{the south side}} of the freeway. Interchanges at Victoria Road (Regional Road24) and Ontario Street (Regional Road18) provide access to the communities of <b>Vineland</b> and Beamsville, respectively. The latter encroaches upon {{the south side of}} the QEW, interrupting the otherwise agricultural surroundings of the highway in Lincoln. Immediately east of the Bartlett Avenue interchange, the freeway enters Grimsby, where it becomes sandwiched between the Niagara Escarpment and Lake Ontario. The route passes under three overpasses that have remained unchanged since the highway was built: Maple Avenue, Ontario Street and Christie Street, all served by a single diamond interchange. South of the 50Point Conservation Area, the freeway exits Niagara Region and enters the city of Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|What is now Route 54 was {{originally}} legislated in 1938 {{to run from}} US 30/US 206 in Hammonton south to Main Road in Landis Township (part of present-day <b>Vineland).</b> The only part taken over as a state highway and designated Route 54 was north of US 40 in Buena, the proposed route south of this point remained as county-maintained Lincoln Avenue. In 1953, Route 54 was defined onto its current alignment. A freeway was proposed along the Route 54 corridor in the late 1960s to connect the southern terminus of US 206 in Hammonton to Route 55 in the Vineland/Millville area; it was eventually canceled.|$|E
5|$|What is now Route55 was {{originally}} {{proposed in the}} 1950s as a toll road called the Cape May Expressway that was to run from the Walt Whitman Bridge to Cape May. In 1962, the New Jersey Expressway Authority was created to build the Cape May Expressway and the Atlantic City Expressway. However, by 1965, the road to Cape May {{was turned over to}} the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) and designated as Route55, which was to run from Westville to Cape May Court House. The first portion of the route opened around Millville in 1969 while the section bypassing <b>Vineland</b> was completed in the 1970s. Route55 was completed north to Deptford in 1989.|$|E
5|$|From here, Route 47 {{continues}} through {{a mix of}} trees and residences, intersecting Schooner Landing Road, which provides access to and from northbound Route 55. Just past this intersection, the route crosses the Manantico Creek into Millville, where it becomes South Second Street, and continues past more woodland containing residences. As the route continues north, residential development increases along with commercial and industrial establishments. Route 47 reaches the commercial downtown of Millville, where it crosses Route 49/County Route 555 and becomes North Second Street. County Route 555 parallels Route 47 a block to the east as the road crosses a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line and intersects County Route 552 Spur. Past this intersection, County Route 555 heads farther {{to the east and}} Route 47 crosses the Conrail Shared Assets Operations line a second time, passing a mix of residences, businesses, and industrial buildings. The road becomes three lanes with a center-left turn lane as it heads through commercial areas {{in the northern part of}} Millville. Upon intersecting High Street, the route widens to five lanes before entering <b>Vineland,</b> where the name becomes Delsea Drive again and it intersects Route 55 at a partial cloverleaf interchange.|$|E
5|$|What is now US 206 in New Jersey was {{designated}} {{as part of}} several state routes prior to 1927, including Pre-1927 Route 2 between Bordentown and Trenton in 1916, pre-1927 Route 13 between Trenton and Princeton in 1917, and pre-1927 Route 16 between Princeton and Bedminster Township in 1921. The current routing along pre-1927 Route 2 {{became a part of}} US 130 in 1926. In 1927, current US 206 became Route 39 between Hammonton and White Horse, Route 37 between White Horse and Trenton, Route 27 between Trenton and Princeton, Route 31 between Princeton and Newton, and Route S31 between Newton and the Delaware River. In the later 1930s, US 206 {{was designated}} to connect US 30 in Hammonton north to US 6 and US 209 in Milford; the northern terminus was moved to its current location in the 1940s. The state highways running concurrent with US 206 in New Jersey were removed in 1953. In the 1960s, two separate freeways were proposed for US 206 but never built. The first freeway was to connect Hammonton south along the Route 54 corridor toward Route 55 and the planned Route 60 in <b>Vineland</b> and Millville. The other US 206 freeway was planned in northwestern New Jersey, connecting I-80 in Netcong north to Montague Township. Construction has begun for a bypass of US 206 around Hillsborough in 2010 after being planned since 1974. The NJDOT widened the route in Byram Township to alleviate congestion, with completion in 2013.|$|E
