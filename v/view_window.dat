50|$|A blast cabinet is {{essentially}} a closed loop system that allows the operator to blast the part and recycle the abrasive. It usually consists of four components; the containment (cabinet), the abrasive blasting system, the abrasive recycling system and the dust collection. The operator blasts the parts from {{the outside of the}} cabinet by placing his arms in gloves attached to glove holes on the cabinet, viewing the part through a <b>view</b> <b>window,</b> turning the blast on and off using a foot pedal or treadle. Automated blast cabinets are also used to process large quantities of the same component and may incorporate multiple blast nozzles and a part conveyance system.|$|E
5000|$|... is little-used. IBM {{documentation}} {{described it}} as [...] "inactive", and the key's purpose was a mystery even to keyboard manufacturers. In modern software, typing text usually causes previous text to scroll {{off the top of}} the screen or window. Some old programs could disable this and restart at the top of the window when scroll lock was pressed. The advantage is that the entire screenful of text does not shift, making it easier to read. Scroll Lock was also used to lock the cursor on its line and scroll the work area under it. In spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel, it locks the cell pointer on the current cell, allowing the user to use the arrow keys to move the <b>view</b> <b>window</b> without moving the cell pointer. On some consoles (such as the Linux console), it prevents scrolling of messages until another key combination is pressed. Many hardware KVM switches use Scroll Lock to switch between the devices they control.|$|E

5000|$|In the Macintosh {{operating}} systems, {{the menu}} bar is a horizontal [...] "bar" [...] {{anchored to the}} top of the screen. In macOS, the left side contains the Apple menu, the Application menu (its name will match the name of the current application) and the currently focused application's menus (e.g. File, Edit, <b>View,</b> <b>Window,</b> Help). On the right side, it contains menu extras (for example the system clock, volume control, and the Fast user switching menu (if enabled) and the Spotlight icon. All of these menu extras (excluding Spotlight) can be moved horizontally by command-clicking and dragging left or right. If an icon is dragged and dropped vertically it will disappear with a puff of smoke, much like the icons in the dock. In the classic Mac OS (versions 7 through 9), the right side contains the application menu, allowing the user to switch between open applications. In Mac OS 8.5 and later, the menu can be dragged downwards, which would cause it to be represented on screen as a floating palette.|$|E
5000|$|The Street <b>View</b> <b>window</b> of GeoGuessr {{does not}} provide any {{information}} beyond the street view images and a compass; things such as road signs, vegetation, businesses, climate, and landmarks have been suggested as some clues that may help the player determine their location. The player may also move about along the roads through the normal directional controls provided by Street View. Once the player is ready to guess the location, they will place a location marker on a zoomable Google Map. After the placed marker is submitted as a guess, GeoGuessr reveals the true geographic location and assigns the player a score depending on how far away the player's guess was from the true location. Scores range between 0 for a guess at an antipode and 5000 points if the guess is within about 150 meters of the correct location. A new location is then provided to the player, and the process repeats until the player has guessed five locations. Newer features include a variable time limit and grouped challenges, such as [...] "Famous Places" [...] or [...] "Sweden".|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{was like a}} waterside mansion in which the backyard used to extend to the river. After its conversion into a cultural center, the walls surrounding the backyard were removed, and the backyard {{became part of the}} green area along the river. It is a 3-story plain structure building made of hewn stone. On the front side, the elevated platform with the elegant columns is built as a projection which gives a symmetry and a government building image to the building. The building has an ampire style with the plain <b>view,</b> <b>window</b> frames and the moldings. Entrance platform used to be connected to the ground level with wide circular stairs, but these stairs were removed during the widening of the street and the side stairs designated to be the entrance. The basement of the building has a lower ceiling than the other floors. This is to prevent flooding of the building which is just next to the river and also to avoid the ground floor not to rise too high from the ground. The proximity of the building to the Taşköprü and being also made of hewn stone strengthens the ideas on the architectural history of Adana.|$|E
