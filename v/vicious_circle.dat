5|$|The blunted {{ventilatory}} {{response is}} attributed to several factors. Obese people tend to have raised levels of the hormone leptin, which is secreted by adipose tissue and under normal circumstances increases ventilation. In OHS, this effect is reduced. Furthermore, episodes of nighttime acidosis (e.g. due to sleep apnea) lead to compensation by the kidneys with retention of the alkali bicarbonate. This normalizes the acidity of the blood. However, bicarbonate stays around in the bloodstream for longer, and further episodes of hypercapnia lead to relatively mild acidosis and reduced ventilatory response in a <b>vicious</b> <b>circle.</b>|$|E

5|$|By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward {{appearances}} of calmness, {{had been in}} long and slow decline since the early 13th century.

40|$|New product {{introduction}} systems are complex socio-technical {{systems that are}} used to design, develop, and deliver products and services to users. Lack of design information within such systems results in uncertainties that have an adverse effect on the performance of the whole system by creating a need for rework. Typical performance measurements for new {{product introduction}} systems are time, cost, and quality. Rework has a significant influence on time-related aspects of system performance because it consumes additional time resource that could otherwise be dedicated to other activities such as the development of new products. Rework reduces time resource available for information communication which in turn leads to more rework in the future. This results in <b>vicious</b> <b>circles</b> where limited time leads to more rework which further detracts from time to devote to other tasks in the future. <b>Vicious</b> <b>circles</b> have previously been reported in societal systems. The goal of this research was to apply modelling and simulation techniques to understand time-related aspects of the <b>vicious</b> <b>circles</b> phenomenon in new product introduction systems and explore potential management interventions to mitigate the consequences of <b>vicious</b> <b>circles.</b> A case study from an international manufacturing organisation was used to inform the development of a simulation mapping between key elements of the new product introduction system and key concepts that underpin agent-based simulation methods. A simulation model was developed to represent <b>vicious</b> <b>circles</b> in the case study, based on the simulation mapping. The simulation model was verified and validated through a series of seven experiments. Four further simulation experiments were then carried out. The first two experiments explored the impact of different prioritisations of responding to information requests on time-related aspects of the system performance. Results highlighted the importance of prioritising responses to information requests which significantly reduced rework volumes in the model. The final two experiments explored the balancing of time taken for individual product development activities and resources used. In simulations with low response rates, one means to avoid system collapse was to extend the time allowed for product development. Given the need to deliver products to market as quickly as possible, a final experiment explored ways to speed up product development to eliminate adverse effects on product development cycle time. By reducing the time taken to respond to requests, which in a real world system could be achieved in a number of ways, e. g. improving team size or design capability, the product development cycle could be shortened...|$|R
