40|$|INTRODUCTION: Starting in June 2010 the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) clinic (a {{large urban}} HIV {{out-patient}} facility) switched to provider-based Electronic Medical Records (EMR) from paper EMR {{entered in the}} database by data-entry clerks. Standardized clinics forms were eliminated but providers still fill free text clinical notes in physical patients' files. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the rate of errors in the database before and after the introduction of the provider-based EMR. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data in the database pre and post provider-based EMR was compared with the information in the patients' files and classified as correct, incorrect, and missing. We calculated the proportion of incorrect, missing and total error for key variables (toxicities, opportunistic infections, reasons for treatment change and interruption). Proportions of total errors were compared using chi-square test. A survey of the users of the EMR was also conducted. We compared data from 2, 382 visits (from 100 individuals) of a retrospective <b>validation</b> <b>conducted</b> in 2007 with 34, 957 visits (from 10, 920 individuals) of a prospective <b>validation</b> <b>conducted</b> in April-August 2011. The total proportion of errors decreased from 66. 5 % in 2007 to 2. 1 % in 2011 for opportunistic infections, from 51. 9 % to 3. 5 % for ART toxicity, from 82. 8 % to 12. 5 % for reasons for ART interruption and from 94. 1 % to 0. 9 % for reasons for ART switch (all P< 0. 0001). The survey showed that 83 % of the providers agreed that provider-based EMR led to improvement of clinical care, 80 % reported improved access to patients' records, and 80 % appreciated the automation of providers' tasks. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of provider-based EMR improved the quality of data collected with a significant reduction in missing and incorrect information. The majority of providers and clients expressed satisfaction with the new system. We recommend the use of provider-based EMR in large HIV programs in Sub-Saharan Africa...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An {{efficient}} {{information retrieval}} {{system should be}} able to provide search results which are in the same time relevant for the query but which cover different aspects, i. e., diverse, of it. In this paper we address the issue of image search result diversification. We propose a new hybrid approach that integrates both the automatization power of the machines and the intelligence of human observers via an optimized multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier-based relevance feedback (RF). In contrast to existing RF techniques which focus almost exclusively on improving the relevance of the results, the novelty of our approach is in considering in priority the diversification. We designed several diversification strategies which operate on top of the SVM RF and exploit the classifiers’ output confidence scores. Experimental <b>validation</b> <b>conducted</b> on a publicly available image retrieval diversification dataset show the benefits of this approach which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of morphological sexing and {{the occurrence of}} sexual dimorphism were analyzed in mature and immature Coscoroba Swans (Coscoroba coscoroba, Anatidae) near the Estação Ecológica do Taim, southern Brazil. On the basis of weight and 10 linear measurements of external morphology, multivariate analysis of vari- ance showed that males were consistently larger than females (sex confirmed via genetic markers) and mature birds were consistently larger than immatures. Overall, 38 % of immatures and 14 % of mature birds were sexed incorrectly by cloacal examination when compared to genetic data. Therefore, we performed a discriminant function analysis of different age classes based on morphometric measurements.

The reliability, flexibility and low computational cost of a data simulation process may ultimately allow researchers to train, tune and test different techniques {{in a variety of}} acoustic scenarios, avoiding the laborious effort of directly recording real data from the targeted environment. In the last decade, several simulated corpora have been released to the research community, including the data-sets distributed in the context of projects and international challenges, such as CHiME and REVERB. These efforts were extremely useful to derive baselines and common evaluation frameworks for comparison purposes.
