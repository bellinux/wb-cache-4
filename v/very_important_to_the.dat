Around 200,000 pieces of {{turquoise}} have been excavated from the ruins at Chaco Canyon, and workshops for local manufacture of turquoise beads have been found. The turquoise was used locally for grave goods, burials and ceremonial offerings. Over 15,000 turquoise beads and pendants accompanied two burials at Pueblo Bonito.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture has {{historically}} been {{a key component of}} the South Dakota economy. Although other industries have expanded rapidly in recent decades, agricultural production is still <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state's economy, especially in rural areas. The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle, corn (maize), soybeans, wheat, and hogs. Agriculture-related industries such as meat packing and ethanol production also have a considerable economic impact on the state. South Dakota {{is one of the largest}} producers of ethanol in the nation.|$|E
5|$|Paris was {{the central}} hub of culture and {{economic}} activity, and as such, the most highly skilled culinary craftsmen were to be found there. Markets in Paris such as Les Halles, la Mégisserie, those found along Rue Mouffetard, and similar smaller versions in other cities were <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> distribution of food. Those that gave French produce its characteristic identity were regulated by the guild system, which developed in the Middle Ages. In Paris, the guilds were regulated by city government {{as well as by}} the French crown. A guild restricted those in a given branch of the culinary industry to operate only within that field.|$|E

5|$|The vegetal diet of the Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} is high {{in fiber}} and only moderate in protein. Salt licks are <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nutrition of the rhino. These licks can be small hot springs, seepages of salty water, or mud-volcanoes. The salt licks also serve an important social purpose for the rhinos—males visit the licks {{to pick up the}} scent of females in oestrus. Some Sumatran rhinos, however, live in areas where salt licks are not readily available, or the rhinos have not been observed using the licks. These rhinos may get their necessary mineral requirements by consuming plants rich in minerals.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of meth mouth usually {{attempts}} to increase salivary flow, halt tooth decay, and encourage behavioral changes. Toothpaste with fluoride is <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> restoration of dental health. Only prescription fluoride rinses can adequately treat the condition. Sialogogues, drugs {{that increase the}} amount of saliva in the mouth, can be used to treat dry mouth and protect against dental health problems. Pilocarpine and cevimeline are sialogogues approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat low salivation caused by Sjogren's syndrome and may have the potential to effectively treat dry mouth caused by methamphetamine use.|$|E
5|$|When {{foraging}} for plants, bears {{choose to}} eat them at the stage when they are at their most nutritious and digestible, typically avoiding older grasses, sedges and leaves. Hence, in more northern temperate areas, browsing and grazing is more common early in spring and later becomes more restricted. Knowing when plants are ripe for eating is a learned behaviour. Berries may be foraged in bushes or at the tops of trees, and bears try to maximize the number of berries consumed versus foliage. In autumn, some bear species forage large amounts of naturally fermented fruits, which affects their behaviour. Smaller bears climb trees to obtain mast (edible reproductive parts, such as acorns). Such masts can be <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> diets of these species, and mast failures may result in long-range movements by bears looking for alternative food sources. Brown bears, with their powerful digging abilities, commonly eat roots. The panda's diet is over 99% bamboo, of 30 different species. Its strong jaws are adapted for crushing the tough stems of these plants, though they prefer to eat the more nutritious leaves. Bromeliads can make up to 50% of the diet of the spectacled bear, which also has strong jaws to bite them open.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the {{evaporator}} and condenser heat exchangers is also <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> overall efficiency of the heat pump.

The life of a dairy cow is a cycle of pregnancy and lactation starting at puberty.

Consequently timing of the first breeding as well as all the subsequent breeding is important for maintaining milk production levels.|$|E

Total food intake is markedly reduced. Due to the reduced size of the newly created stomach pouch, and reduced food intake, adequate nutrition demands that the patient follow the surgeon's instructions for food consumption, including the number of meals to be taken daily, adequate protein intake, and the use of vitamin and mineral supplements. Calcium supplements, iron supplements, protein supplements, multi-vitamins (sometimes pre-natal vitamins are best), and vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) supplements are all <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> post-operative bypass patient.|$|E

The main ingredients that are used in their cuisine are olive oil, garlic, palm dates, grains, and milk. These products are natural to this area, and these ingredients are very common to much of North Africa and the Mediterranean. Another tradition of Libyan culinary culture is tea. Tea from Benghazi has a uniquely thick, bitter taste. Tea drinking is a social activity that close friends and relatives usually take part in.|$|E
