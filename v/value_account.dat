40|$|This article-based thesis {{consists}} of three main papers that examine the use of fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> in banks {{and how it can}} influence behaviour with systemic effects; this helps in understanding the role of fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> in the global financial crisis. The examination consisted of two parts. The first part was the investigation of how fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> was actually used by South African banks. The second part was the development of an analytical model that links together fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting,</b> bank capital regulation and economic outcomes. The South African case study was further divided into two parts. In the first part, a comparative design was used to investigate in detail how fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> was implemented by two South African banks and what their motivations were. The second part sought to answer the question: did South African banks pay out higher dividends based on risky fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> gains? The South African evidence indicates that fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> materially impacts the profit and loss and the regulatory capital of banks. This component of regulatory capital proved to be risky. Dangerous pay-outs resulted from the increase in profits and bank assets grew the most during the period of risky capital formation. It was found that the use of a stock-flow consistent model of the economy was a commonality amongst those that predicted the global financial crisis. A stock-flow consistent model was shown to be descriptive of the South African evidence. The model showed fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> to be at the centre of feedback processes that can weaken the banking system during the economic upswing. The study concludes that fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> is central in processes that weaken the banking system during an economic upswing and thus demonstrates why the current call for prudent accounting in banks is justified. The study expands on current literature in a number of ways. It adds to the literature that fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> is procyclical by demonstrating that this effect is not constant throughout the cycle and is more problematic during the upswing; this differs from the usual argument that fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> accelerates the downturn. The South African empirical evidence showed that fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> for available-for-sale assets is not the only avenue for fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> to be dangerous; fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> adjustments through profit and loss should also be monitored. The analytical model as well as the South African empirical evidence contradicts the common argument that the fair value measurement of financial instruments must be pervasive in a bank and banking system to be dangerous. The South African empirical evidence shows that fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> must be considered a possible avenue of earnings or capital management in banks...|$|R

The body of data brought together show that a variety of configurations preclude command of the predicate by the negative scoping over it, and that scope is a semantic rather than structural relation. Scope defines the domain in which an item can be focused by negation. Negative focus is dependent on the evocation of an alternative value, which may be generated by lexical antonymy, syntactic determination or contextual corrections.

40|$|A {{multitude}} of theories on decision making suppose that individuals choose between different prospects {{by placing a}} value, or utility, on these prospects and selecting whichever prospect has the highest value. If decisions were at all times value-based, then choices should always be transitive. Transitivity holds that, if prospect A is preferred over prospect B, and B is preferred over C, A should also be preferred over C. Despite its intuitive appeal, individuals often show striking violations of transitivity. Intransitive decisions could be the consequence of asymmetrically distributed errors made during the implementation of transitively organized values because individuals {{may be more likely}} to erroneously choose against their true preference when the discrimination between the prospects' values is difficult compared to situations where the prospect with the highest value is clearly and easily detectable. Alternatively, intransitive choices may reflect genuinely context-dependent preferences because individuals may compare the options' multiple attributes separately, not in an integrated fashion. This chapter replicates intransitive choices in a risky decision-making task, and presents a novel analysis that argues against the noisy implementation of transitive <b>value</b> <b>account.</b> It argues that choices reflect truly intransitive and context-dependent preferences, and discusses several possible explanations why individuals make decisions in such a way...|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that {{artificial}} neural networks (ANNs) are useful for predicting the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of rocks. However, ANNs do have some deficiencies: they can get trapped in local minima and they have a slow learning rate. It is widely accepted that optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) can improve ANN performance. This study investigated the application of a hybrid PSO-based ANN model to the prediction of rock UCS. To prepare a dataset for the predictive model, extensive laboratory tests (i. e., 160 tests in total) were conducted on 40 soft rock sample sets (mostly shale) presenting various weathering grades that were obtained from different excavation sites in Johor, Malaysia. The laboratory tests included the UCS test and other basic rock index tests (the Brazilian tensile strength test, point load index test, and ultrasonic test). When developing the predictive model of UCS, the results of the basic rock tests as well as the bulk densities of the samples were used as input parameters, while the UCS was set as the output of the predictive model. The <b>value</b> <b>account</b> for (VAF), root mean squared error (RMSE), and adjusted R 2 (coefficient of determination) were utilized to check the performances of the predictive models.

These operations produce several undesirable environmental impacts such as ground vibration, air-overpressure (AOp), and flyrock in the nearby environments.

This paper is aimed to predict the blasting environmental impacts in granite quarry sites through two intelligent systems, namely artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). For this purpose, 166 blasting operations at four granite quarry sites in Malaysia were investigated and the values of peak particle velocity (PPV), AOp, and flyrock were precisely recorded in each blasting operation. Considering some model performance indices including coefficient of determination (R 2), <b>value</b> <b>account</b> for (VAF), and root mean square error (RMSE), and also using simple ranking procedure, the best models for prediction of PPV, AOp, and flyrock were selected.

40|$|As the {{two major}} {{accounting}} standard setters, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), are jointly advocating a full fair value disclosure regime, there have been heated discussions regarding {{the pros and cons}} of fair value versus historical cost among accounting researchers, practitioners, and regulators. Current accounting research basically examines the value relevance of fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> from a shareholder perspective (e. g., Barth, 1994; Petroni and Wahlen, 1995; Song et al., 2010). In comparison, the impact of fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> on the debt market is largely under-investigated. As noted by Baker, Greenwood and Wurgler (2003, p. 262), “Relative to the literature on equity financing patterns, and relative to the actual importance of debt finance in the U. S. economy, the literature on debt financing patterns is surprisingly underdeveloped”. Hence, the interface between accounting regime and debt financing has recently emerged as a fruitful area for research. In fact, creditors, especially public debtholders, have informational and pay-off disadvantages that they seek useful accounting information to compensate for. 	The purpose of this dissertation is twofold: (1) to examine the impact of fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> on the debt market; (2) to examine the influence of specialized auditors on the association between fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> and the debt market effects. The investigation focuses on U. S. bank holding companies issuing debt as they are the reporting entities most affected by the advent of fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting.</b> The first essay focuses on the relative explanatory power of fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> versus historical cost in explaining credit ratings, a common proxy for firm credit quality. I consider both short-term and long-term credit ratings. Results show that fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> outperforms historical cost in explaining firm short-term credit ratings. On the contrary, I do not find evidence that fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> is a better predictor of firm long-term credit ratings. Additional tests further reveal that auditor industry expertise improves fair value’s explanatory power for short-term credit risk. The second essay concentrates on the impact of fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> on banks’ cost of debt, proxied by yield spread. Results suggest that greater use of fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> measurement in the financial statements is generally associated with a lower cost of debt, which supports the argument that fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> improves the decision usefulness of accounting information. Findings further show that Level 1 and Level 2 fair value inputs are related with a lower cost of debt, while Level 3 fair value inputs are associated with a higher cost of debt. In addition, evidence suggests that auditor industry expertise improves the decision usefulness of fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> information, especially of Level 3 inputs, resulting in lower cost of debt. 	Overall, these results lead to the conclusion that fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> is generally decision useful, although the extent of decision usefulness of fair value varies across the three tiers of fair value levels. Besides, the existence of industry specialized auditors improves the decision usefulness of fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> to debtholders. However, cautions are advised with regard to the implications based on the empirical results, due to the limitations of the methodologies used in this dissertation.

Iargued that the best account of the wrongness of killing adults and children is that killing us deprives us of our valuable futures, of all of the goods of life that we would have experienced if we had lived out our natural life spans. On the assumption that the wrongness of abortion stands or falls on the moral standing of the fetus, it follows that abortion i...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to all benefits of blasting in mining and civil engineering applications, it has some undesirable environmental impacts. Backbreak is an unwanted phenomenon of blasting which can cause instability of mine walls, decreasing efficiency of drilling, falling down of machinery, etc. Recently, the use of new approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI) is greatly recommended by many researchers. In this paper, a new AI technique namely genetic programing (GP) was developed to predict BB. To prepare a sufficient database, 175 blasting works were investigated in Sungun copper mine, Iran. In these operations, the most influential parameters on BB including burden, spacing, stemming length, powder factor and stiffness ratio were measured and used to develop BB predictive models. To demonstrate capability of GP technique, a non-linear multiple regression (NLMR) model was also employed for prediction of BB. <b>Value</b> <b>account</b> for (VAF), {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R 2) were used to control the capacity performance of the predictive models. The performance indices obtained by GP approach indicate the higher reliability of GP compared to NLMR model. RMSE and VAF values of 0. 327 and 97. 655, respectively, for testing datasets of GP approach reveal the superiority of this model in predicting BB, while these values were obtained as 0. 865 and 81. 816, respectively, for NLMR model...|$|E
40|$|Your {{life has}} meaning just if, {{and to the}} extent that, you achieve the aims that you devote it to freely and competently. You adopt your goals and achieve them more or less through your own efforts, so meaning is {{something}} you bestow upon your own life. These achievements are the meaning of your life. In what follows I develop this view. 1 Then I will discuss how life’s meaning is related to its purpose and to an individual’s welfare and identity. I also examine reasoning that suggests that life is absurd and show how it can be resisted. Meaning The achievementist view I am defending is an elaboration of two assumptions. First, the bearer of meaning is not, strictly speaking, a living subject, but rather that subject’s life. Second, the meaning of one’s life concerns what one devotes it to. While these assumptions are plausible, they are also strong; they imply, for example, that the lives of nonhuman animals (with some possible exceptions) lack meaning—which {{is not to say that}} they lack value, that they are not worthwhile; for reasons offered below, I reject the <b>value</b> <b>account</b> of meaning, which equates the meaning and value of a life. Animals may live well; however, animals cannot survey and take a stance on their lives as wholes, which is requisite for turning them to various ends. Nor are animals the only creatures with meaningless lives. Some people live in the moment, lost in Alltäglichkeit, and are oblivious t...|$|E

30|$|Literature on {{accounting}} standards in China from 2008 to 2018 mainly investigates {{the effectiveness of}} the China {{accounting standards}} reform in 2006 which converged with the IFRS. The feature of the new accounting standards is that fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> is introduced for measurement attributes. In general, the <b>value</b> relevance of <b>accounting</b> information is increased with the new adoption of accounting standards in 2006. However, they also provide evidence that the increased <b>value</b> relevance of <b>accounting</b> information is due to comprehensive measurement rather than the simple adoption of fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting.</b> Subsequently, He et al. (2012) show that there are some unintended consequences to fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> in China, including the increased incentive of using fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> to meet regulatory earnings targets and avoid reporting a loss when exchanging nonfinancial assets in debt restructuring. The development of accounting regulations for foreign invested firms in China is introduced andreflects how to mediate the adaptation and transformation of Western accounting ideas in China.|$|R
