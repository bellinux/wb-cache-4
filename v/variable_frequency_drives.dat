50|$|The {{installation}} {{and integration of}} <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> can lower the energy consumption of the building's circulation pumps to about 15% {{of what they had}} been using before. A variable frequency drive functions by modulating the frequency of the electricity provided to the motor that it powers. In the USA, the electrical grid uses a frequency of 60 Hertz or 60 cycles per second. <b>Variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> are able to decrease the output and energy consumption of motors by lowering the frequency of the electricity provided to the motor, however the relationship between motor output and energy consumption is not a linear one. If the variable frequency drive provides electricity to the motor at 30 Hertz, the output of the motor will be 50% because 30 Hertz divided by 60 Hertz is 0.5 or 50%. The energy consumption of a motor running at 50% or 30 Hertz will not be 50%, but will instead be something like 18% because the relationship between motor output and energy consumption are not linear. The exact ratios of motor output or Hertz provided to the motor (which are effectively the same thing), and the actual energy consumption of the variable frequency drive / motor combination depend on the efficiency of the variable frequency drive. For example, because the variable frequency drive needs power itself to communicate with the building automation system, run its cooling fan, etc., if the motor always ran at 100% with the variable frequency drive installed the cost of operation or electricity consumption would actually go up with the new variable frequency drive installed. The amount of energy that <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> consume is nominal and is hardly worth consideration when calculating savings, however it did need to be noted that VFD's do consume energy themselves. Because the <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> rarely ever run at 100% and {{spend most of their time}} in the 40% output range, and because now the pumps completely shut down when not needed, the <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> have reduced the energy consumption of the pumps to around 15% of what they had been using before.|$|E
