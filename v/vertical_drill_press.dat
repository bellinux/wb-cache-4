50|$|A third type also exists, {{a lighter}} machine, called a mill-drill, {{which is a}} close {{relative}} of the vertical mill and quite popular with hobbyists. A mill-drill is similar in basic configuration to a small <b>drill</b> <b>press,</b> but equipped with an X-Y table. They also typically use more powerful motors than a comparably sized <b>drill</b> <b>press,</b> with potentiometer-controlled speed and generally have more heavy-duty spindle bearings than a <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> {{to deal with the}} lateral loading on the spindle that is created by a milling operation. A mill drill also typically raises and lowers the entire head, including motor, often on a dovetailed <b>vertical,</b> where a <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> motor remains stationary, while the arbor raises and lowers within a driving collar. Other differences that separate a mill-drill from a <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> may be a fine tuning adjustment for the Z-axis, a more precise depth stop, the capability to lock the X, Y or Z axis, and often a system of tilting the head or the entire vertical column and powerhead assembly to allow angled cutting. Aside from size and precision, the principal difference between these hobby-type machines and larger true vertical mills is that the X-Y table is at a fixed elevation; the Z-axis is controlled in basically the same fashion as <b>drill</b> <b>press,</b> where a larger vertical or knee mill has a vertically fixed milling head, and changes the X-Y table elevation. As well, a mill-drill often uses a standard drill press-type Jacob's chuck, rather than an internally tapered arbor that accepts collets. These are frequently of lower quality than other types of machines, but still fill the hobby role well because they tend to be benchtop machines with small footprints and modest price tags.|$|R

50|$|For most drill presses—especially those {{meant for}} {{woodworking}} or home use—speed change {{is achieved by}} manually moving a belt across a stepped pulley arrangement. Some <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> add a third stepped pulley {{to increase the number}} of available speeds. Modern <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> can, however, use a variable-speed motor in conjunction with the stepped-pulley system. Medium-duty <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> such as those used in machine shop (tool room) applications are equipped with a continuously variable transmission. This mechanism is based on variable-diameter pulleys driving a wide, heavy-duty belt. This gives a wide speed range as well as the ability to change speed while the machine is running. Heavy-duty <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> used for metalworking are usually of the gear-head type described below.|$|R

50|$|A <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> (also {{known as}} a {{pedestal}} drill, pillar drill, or bench drill) is a fixed style of drill that may be mounted on a stand or bolted to the floor or workbench. Portable models with a magnetic base grip the steel workpieces they <b>drill.</b> A <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> consists of a base, column (or pillar), table, spindle (or quill), and drill head, usually driven by an induction motor. The head has a set of handles (usually 3) radiating from a central hub that, when turned, move the spindle and chuck vertically, parallel to the axis of the column. The <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> is typically {{measured in terms of}} swing. Swing is defined as twice the throat distance, which is the distance {{from the center of the}} spindle to the closest edge of the pillar. For example, a 16 in <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> has an 8 in throat distance.|$|R
50|$|Geared head <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> are {{commonly}} found in tool rooms and other commercial environments where a heavy duty machine capable of production drilling and quick setup changes is required. In most cases, the spindle is machined to accept Morse taper tooling for greater flexibility. Larger geared head <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> are frequently fitted with power feed on the quill mechanism, with an arrangement to disengage the feed when a certain drill depth has been achieved or {{in the event of}} excessive travel. Some gear-head <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> have the ability to perform tapping operations without the need for an external tapping attachment. This feature is commonplace on larger gear head <b>drill</b> <b>presses.</b> A clutch mechanism drives the tap into the part under power and then backs it out of the threaded hole once the proper depth is reached. Coolant systems are also common on these machines to prolong tool life under production conditions.|$|R
40|$|Construction workers {{frequently}} perform overhead drilling into concrete, {{which is}} associated with a high frequency of pain and disability, presumably due to high shoulder loads and awkward neck postures. My thesis involved the design and evaluation of an Inverted <b>Drill</b> <b>Press,</b> an ergonomic intervention device for overhead drilling. In Study 1, I designed a new Inverted <b>Drill</b> <b>Press</b> based on feedback from focus groups. I then conducted field tests to evaluate the intervention on construction sites and compare it to conventional overhead drilling. Results showed reduced fatigue, improved usability, and improved neck posture with the intervention. Elevated shoulder postures and drilling speed were not improved and reflected areas where the Inverted <b>Drill</b> <b>Press</b> could be refined. In Study 2, I conducted biomechanical modelling to compare shoulder torques during drilling and to identify the optimal placement for the crank on an Inverted <b>Drill</b> <b>Press</b> in order to minimize shoulder torque...|$|R

50|$|As an {{alternative}} to trenching, loops may be laid by mini horizontal directional drilling (mini-HDD). This technique can lay piping under yards, driveways, gardens or other structures without disturbing them, with a cost between those of trenching and <b>vertical</b> <b>drilling.</b> This system also differs from horizontal & <b>vertical</b> <b>drilling</b> as the loops are installed from one central chamber, further reducing the ground space needed. Radial drilling is often installed retroactively (after the property has been built) due to the small nature of the equipment used {{and the ability to}} bore beneath existing constructions.|$|R

50|$|A geared head <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> is a <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> {{in which}} power {{transmission}} from the motor to the spindle is achieved solely through spur gearing inside the machine's head.

40|$|A {{study of}} axial {{vibrations}} in a <b>vertical</b> <b>drill</b> string is conducted using a spring-mass-damper model with n coupled elements. The main motivation behind {{this is to}} describe the axial vibrations using a simple mathematical model that allows for a substantial interpretation and application of control theory. In other words, the analytical model describing the test segments in this thesis can easily apply to other <b>vertical</b> <b>drill</b> string models, with a few adjustments. The study attempts {{to answer the following}} research question: To what extent can the lumped element model be used to replicate and predict axial vibrations in a <b>vertical</b> <b>drill</b> string? The analytical model is derived and tested on the following three scenarios. The first scenario considers only the transient state of the model. It divides into overdamped, critically damped, and underdamped systems. This scenario features both physical experiments and numerical simulations. Results from experiments and numerical simulations are presented graphically in order to identify similarities between the two systems. The second scenario considers the step response as the driving force, and the last scenario introduces a sinusoidal driving force. Only numerical simulations are presented in the last two scenarios. It is found that the lumped element model cannot be verified {{on the basis of a}} comparison of the experimental results and the analytical model for the transient state. The analytical model cannot replicate and predict axial vibrations in a <b>vertical</b> <b>drill</b> string...|$|R

5000|$|A {{radial arm}} <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> {{is a large}} geared head <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> in which the head can be moved along an arm that radiates from the machine's column. As it is {{possible}} to swing the arm relative to the machine's base, a radial arm <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> is able to operate over a large area without having to reposition the workpiece. This saves considerable time because it is much faster to reposition the drill head than it is to unclamp, move, and then re-clamp the workpiece to the table. The size of work that can be handled may be considerable, as the arm can swing {{out of the way of}} the table, allowing an overhead crane or derrick to place a bulky workpiece on the table or base. A vise may be used with a radial arm <b>drill</b> <b>press,</b> but more often the workpiece is secured directly to the table or base, or is held in a fixture. Power spindle feed is nearly universal with these machines and coolant systems are common. Larger size machines often have power feed motors for elevating or moving the arm. The biggest radial arm <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> are able to drill holes as large as four inches (101.6 millimeters) diameter in solid steel or cast iron. Radial arm drills are specified by the diameter of the column and the length of the arm. The length of the arm is usually the same as the maximum throat distance. The Radial Arm Drill pictured in this article is a 9-inch column x 3-foot arm. The maximum throat distance of this drill would be approximately 36", giving a swing of 72" [...] (6 feet)..|$|R
