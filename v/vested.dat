40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} stock option expense recognition on contract design, focusing on option grant <b>vesting</b> schedules. Contrary to a commonly held belief that firms use boilerplate <b>vesting</b> schedules, we document significant variation in <b>vesting</b> terms. Consistent with expense recognition influencing contract design, we find that firms extend option grant <b>vesting</b> periods after recognizing stock option expense thereby delaying {{the recognition of the}} expense. We also test for several economic determinants of <b>vesting</b> terms, including the desire to extend the executive’s investment horizon, to allow for rebalancing of risk-taking incentives, and to promote executive retention. We find that the restrictiveness of the <b>vesting</b> schedule depends on the primary motivation for granting options. When the objective is to retain the executive and provide long horizon incentives, firms use longer <b>vesting</b> periods and CEO power results in less restrictive <b>vesting</b> terms. We also find that external monitors are associated with longer <b>vesting</b> and that institutional ownership influences <b>vesting</b> periods. Overall, this study provides evidence that <b>vesting</b> terms are an important component of executive compensation and that accounting regulations {{play a significant role in}} contract desig...|$|R

50|$|One {{problem with}} some {{weighted}} <b>vests</b> is {{that due to}} tightness in the shoulder girdle, in movements like pull-ups or high range of motion pushups, the <b>vest</b> can be shearing, either damaging the person or in some cases, the <b>vest</b> itself being slowly torn away. This {{can also be seen}} as an advantage, however, in those who wish to limit their range of motion due to lack of strength or flexibility, to avoid injury. The limitations of front and back bending of the core is for example, contrasted by ergonomic construction to encourage good posture in modern weighted <b>vests</b> such as the x-vest, hyper <b>vest</b> or game-breakers pro suit. Another problem with some weighted <b>vests</b> is the constriction of breathing and overheating due to the use of heavy, non-breathing materials such as nylon and neoprene. The latest developments in weighted <b>vest</b> products offer comfortable weight <b>vests</b> with cool wicking fabric that allow full range and direction of movement, chest expansion for breathing, open sides connected with lacing, and low profile design allowing a <b>vest</b> to be worn under clothing or football pads, unlike traditional <b>vests</b> made of nylon or neoprene.|$|R
40|$|Abstract To {{alleviate}} worker's {{thermal discomfort}} in a moderately hot environment, a new cooling <b>vest</b> {{was designed and}} proposed in this paper. To investigate {{the effect of the}} cooling <b>vest</b> and to collect the knowledge for the design of comfortable cooling <b>vest,</b> subjective experiments were conducted. Two kinds of cooling <b>vests,</b> the new one and the commercially available one, were used for comparison. The new cooling <b>vest</b> had more insulation and its surface temperature was higher than the commercially available one. Experiments were performed in the climatic chamber where operative temperature was controlled at 3 O. 2 ℃ and relative humidity was at 37 % under still air. In addition, experiment without cooling <b>vest</b> was carried out as a control condition. The results obtained in these experiments were as follow : 1) By wearing both types of cooling <b>vest,</b> the whole body thermal sensation was closer to the neutral conditions than those without cooling <b>vest.</b> This effect was estimated to be equal to the 5. 7 ℃ decrement of operative temperature. The subjects felt more comfortable with the cooling <b>vest</b> than without it. They felt more thermally acceptable than that without cooling <b>vest.</b> Wearing the cooling <b>vest</b> was useful to decrease the sweating sensation. 2) The local discomfort was observed when the local thermal sensation was "cool"～"cold" with the cooling <b>vest.</b> 3) The new cooling <b>vest</b> kept the skin temperature at chest at about 32. 6 ℃. On the other hand, by wearing the commercially available one, it lowered to about 31. 1 ℃. By wearing the new cooling <b>vest,</b> there was a tendency that local thermal sensation vote was higher and local comfort sensation vote was more comfortable than those of the condition wearing the commercially available one. It is important for the design of a comfortable cooling garment to prevent over-cool down from the body...|$|R

The Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the Supreme Head of State of Malaysia, also ceased to be the Supreme Head of Singapore and relinquished his sovereignty, jurisdiction, power and authority, executive or otherwise in respect of Singapore, which revested in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara of Singapore.

40|$|Objectives—A {{three year}} {{drowning}} pre-vention campaign focused on increasing {{the use of}} life <b>vests</b> among children 1 – 14 years old. An evaluation was conducted to determine campaign awareness, change in ownership and use of life <b>vests</b> by children, and predictors of life <b>vest</b> use. Setting—King County, Washington. Methods—Four telephone surveys were conducted with parents before, during, and after the campaign. Results—The campaign was recalled by 50 % of families surveyed. From before to after the campaign, reported life <b>vest</b> use by children on docks, beaches, or at pools increased from 20 % to 29 % (p< 0. 01) and life <b>vest</b> ownership for children increased from 69 % to 75 % (p= 0. 06). Among parents aware of the campaign, reported child life <b>vest</b> use increased from 20 % to 34 % (p< 0. 001) and ownership increased from 69 % to 80 % (p< 0. 01). Among families unaware of the campaign, neither life <b>vest</b> use nor ownership changed significantly. Children were more often reported to wear life <b>vests</b> if a parent knew of the cam-paign, was confident fitting the <b>vest,</b> was younger than 40 years, felt the child could not swim well, and owned a life <b>vest</b> for the child. Conclusions—A community-wide drown-ing prevention campaign resulted in a sig-nificant, although modest, increase in reported life <b>vest</b> use and ownership among children...|$|R

5000|$|A trauma plate, {{also known}} as a trauma pack, is a plate that is an add-on component/insert to a {{ballistic}} <b>vest.</b> Its primary purpose is to absorb and disrupt the kinetic energy of a bullet impact and reduce the blunt trauma transferred to the wearer of the <b>vest.</b> Trauma plates typically enhance the ballistic value (how [...] "bulletproof" [...] it is) of the part of the <b>vest</b> that they are positioned behind. Trauma plates are most commonly found in a pocket in front of the ballistic panel of a <b>vest</b> and positioned {{in the center of the}} chest.
