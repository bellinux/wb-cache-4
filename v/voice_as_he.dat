While it {{only had}} two lines, Burton {{said that he}} felt Lee {{to be a good}} match for the iconic {{character}} because he is [...] "an iconic guy". For the character, Lee had originally tried to make his voice [...] "burble" [...] (as described in the poem [...] "Jabberwocky"). However, [...] Burton convinced him to use his actual <b>voice,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> found it more intimidating and aggressive.|$|E
500|$|In 1927, Treatt {{was given}} the {{position}} of Challis lecturer in criminal law at the University of Sydney, a position he was to hold until 1959. One of his students was the future Justice of the High Court of Australia, Michael Kirby: [...] "I can still see Mr Vernon Treatt QC coming on to {{the stage of the}} Phillip Street Theatre where we took some of our lectures. Treatt's task was to instruct a hundred first year law students in that most important discipline, criminal law. I can see him toss his hat onto the chair, open his notes and begin reading his latest lesson. I can hear him talking about the sections of the Crimes Act 1900 of New South Wales dealing with 'unnatural offences'. I can recall his rasping <b>voice</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> intoned the old provisions of section 79, spitting out the exceptionally ugly words of denunciation in the parliamentary prose". In March 1928, Treatt was appointed and served as a Crown Prosecutor for the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Court of Quarter sessions for the metropolitan district.|$|E
500|$|After a {{night out}} with Sam Kingston (Scott Wright), Toyah decides to walk home alone but is {{attacked}} and raped. Toyah is found by Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), who takes her home. Janice initially thinks Toyah has been robbed and is shocked when Toyah tells her she was raped. Toyah gives {{a statement to the}} police and is examined at the hospital. Several male residents are suspected, particularly Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), but they are ruled out by DNA tests. Toyah struggles to deal with what has happened to her and she develops agoraphobia. While being comforted at home by her friend, Phil Simmonds (Jack Deam), Toyah recognises his <b>voice</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> calls out her name and realises that he raped her. Phil realizes that she knows and stops her escaping but Peter hears Toyah's screams and rescues her after knocking Phil unconscious. Phil is found guilty of rape and sent to prison. Toyah has a brief romance with Sam and moves into a flat with Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine) and Maria Sutherland (Samia Ghadie).|$|E

500|$|Gilbert {{prepared}} meticulously {{for each}} new work, making {{models of the}} stage, actors and set pieces, and designing every action and bit of business in advance. Gilbert would not work with actors who challenged his authority. George Grossmith wrote that, at least sometime, [...] "Mr. Gilbert is a perfect autocrat, insisting that his words should be delivered, even to an inflection of the <b>voice,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> dictates. He will stand on the stage beside the actor or actress, and repeat the words with appropriate action over and over again, until they are delivered as he desires them to be." [...] Even during long runs and revivals, Gilbert closely supervised the performances of his plays, {{making sure that the}} actors did not make unauthorised additions, deletions or paraphrases. Gilbert was famous for demonstrating the action himself, even as he grew older. Gilbert himself went on stage in a number of productions throughout his lifetime, including several performances as the Associate in Trial by Jury, as substitute for an ailing actor in his play Broken Hearts, and in charity matinees of his one-act plays, such as King Claudius in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.|$|E
500|$|Toyah {{was aware}} that her {{attacker}} knew her as she remembered him calling her name, but could not put a name to the voice. She also struggled {{to deal with her}} [...] "physical and emotional scars" [...] and soon developed agoraphobia. Toyah found support from her mother and neighbour Charlie Ramsden (Clare McGlinn), who revealed that she had once been raped. Taylor told Inside Soap's Allison Maund that Charlie's advice really helped Toyah to start getting back on her feet. However, the process was hampered when Toyah received an anonymous phone call, which left her feeling [...] "extremely frightened". The phone call sparked [...] "a terrifying event" [...] in which Toyah's rapist was finally revealed to be her friend Phil Simmonds (Jack Deam). When Phil came round to comfort Toyah, she recognised his <b>voice</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> called out her name and realised that he was her rapist. While Toyah tried to escape, Phil grabbed her and held her hostage. Toyah's screams were heard by Peter, who broke the door down and knocked Phil unconscious. A show spokesperson commented that Toyah would be left to worry about whether Phil would deny the rape and be convicted.|$|E
500|$|On release, Billboard {{magazine}} described [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] as [...] "a musical {{appeal to}} help our fellow-man" [...] that [...] "should find immediate and heavy chart action". In his contemporary review for the NME, Derek Johnson considered the song to be [...] "ot so strong melodically as 'My Sweet Lord', but still nagging and insistent", and added: [...] "one can immediately detect the despair and pity in [...] <b>voice</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sings of the appalling plight of the East Pakistanis... his lyric is bound to cause some heart-searching." [...] A wave of public goodwill accompanied the single's release in 1971, {{as was the case}} with the two benefit concerts, the subsequent live album, and the 1972 concert film. Simon Leng has identified genuine friendship as being key to the success of Harrison and Shankar's relief project: the friendship between the two of them that saw the ex-Beatle become involved, and the friendships Harrison had cultivated with Dylan, Clapton and Starr that ensured their participation. Leng notes that the opening lyrics to [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] ("My friend came to me...") could equally have applied to Harrison's efforts to enlist the reluctant Dylan and heroin-sidelined Clapton.|$|E
60|$|Geoffrey {{returned}} a conventional answer, {{and there was}} a buzz of <b>voices</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> and Bransome walked back together towards the gorge. The rancher halted discreetly when his companion, taking a brand from a fire near it, clambered over the boulders. Geoffrey disappeared among the rocks, and the voices grew louder when he came into view again walking hurriedly.|$|R

500|$|According to Jean, Jackson {{would not}} {{commit to the}} episode until after a {{read-through}} of the script was done. The read was held at Jackson's manager Sandy Gallin's house, and Dan Castellaneta (who provides the voice for Homer) was 30 minutes late. Jean recalls that [...] "no one said a word, we just sat there waiting". Following the read, Jackson stipulated his conditions: he would record his speaking parts but not receive credit, and his singing voice would be performed by a sound-alike. Leon Kompowsky's singing parts were performed by Kipp Lennon, because Jackson wanted to play a joke on his brothers and fool them into thinking the impersonator was him. Lennon recorded his lines {{at the same time}} as Jackson, who found the impersonations humorous. Jackson showed up for the recording session alone and did not use the special trailer that was set up for him. According to Jean, Jackson did record versions of the singing parts, and while there have been rumors that those parts were the ones used in the final episode, The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma has stated the Lennon versions were used. Kompowsky's normal speaking voice, which is heard at the end of the episode, was recorded by cast member Hank Azaria. The episode originally was supposed to end with Kompowsky singing a portion of [...] "Man in the Mirror" [...] in his Michael Jackson <b>voice</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> walked down the road, but it was changed to him singing the beginning of [...] "Happy Birthday Lisa".|$|E
500|$|John Ulmer of website One Thirty BPM {{gave the}} song seven points {{out of a}} {{possible}} ten, and published a mixed review; he praised it for being a more serious track compared to previous lead singles [...] "Just Lose It" [...] (2004) and [...] "We Made You" [...] (2009) but criticized it for being less powerful compared to his 2002 hit single, [...] "Lose Yourself", and [...] "Beautiful". According to Ulmer, [...] "Upon first listen it's a bit corny, but it's appropriately anthemic, and not bad enough to deter from the strength of the overall track." [...] He noted that although Eminem does not have as much of a frustrated <b>voice</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> does in [...] "Despicable", he admits that Relapse was a silly album. Pitchfork Media's Jayson Greene wrote a rather negative review on Recovery and was very dismissive on the song: [...] "Eminem spends nearly half of Recovery insisting he's the best rapper alive, {{but for the first time}} in his career, he actually sounds clumsy." [...] Kitty Empire of newspaper The Guardian also wrote negatively on the song in her album review, criticizing the song's lyrics: [...] "Rhyming 'through a storm' with 'whatever weather/ cold or warm' in the chorus is unforgivable for a master rhymer." [...] As part of his album review, Greg Kot of daily newspaper Chicago Tribune criticized Eminem's lyrics and rhymes in [...] "Not Afraid", comparing them to his rhyming skills back when his 2002 hip hop drama film, 8 Mile, premiered: [...] "Doesn't he realize that's the kind of cheese that the battle-rhyming Eminem of 8 Mile would've mercilessly mocked?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{last known}} {{survivor}} of the accident, Peter Stoddart, was interviewed in Wisbech by Michael Simkins in around 1985. Simkins wrote in The Guardian in 2001: [...] "I asked him about a story I had heard of an officer who went about the scene shooting men trapped in the burning wreckage. 'That was true. I saw that. He was a Scottish gentleman, eventually a millionaire. But he had to.' There was a suspicion of a chuckle in his <b>voice</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> added: 'And there were one or two other survivors who made themselves scarce. They took their opportunity.'" [...] Peter Stoddart died on 4 July 1988 following a stroke.|$|E

2500|$|Instructors {{appear to}} use podcasts {{in several ways}} within {{academic}} settings. For example, podcasts are used to duplicate the classroom lecture. [...] The student attends the lecture and uses the podcast as a backup for reviewing complex topics. Podcasts are also used to share additional information with students {{in the form of}} audio recordings that aid student learning and provide support in relation to core learning materials. This includes assignment tips, hints, and pre/post-assignment feedback, along with additional audio to supplement subject content. Language, Science and Social Studies teachers in K-12 settings use podcasts of news coverage, historically significant speeches, cultural events and official happenings as rich trappings for the teaching-learning process. Students in a French or Political Science class can listen, for example, to a podcast of former French President Jacques Chirac's actual <b>voice</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> departs his presidential position. They could also listen to French citizens as they discuss Chirac's position.|$|E
