5|$|After resigning from Berkeley, Kaczynski {{moved to}} his parents' home in Lombard, Illinois, then {{two years later}} to a remote cabin he had built outside Lincoln, Montana. Here he lived a simple life on <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>money,</b> without {{electricity}} or running water, working odd jobs and receiving some financial support from his family.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} no desire {{for a change in}} the form of {{government}} among most Brazilians, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator. PedroII had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He did not allow his ouster to be opposed and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent {{the last two years of}} his life in exile in Europe, living alone on <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E
5|$|Druitt's {{father died}} {{suddenly}} {{from a heart}} attack in September 1885, leaving an estate valued at £16,579 (equivalent to £ today). In a codicil, Druitt senior instructed his executors to deduct the money he had advanced to his son from the legacy of £500. Montague received <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>money,</b> if any, from his father's will, although he did receive some of his father's personal possessions. Most of Dr Druitt's estate went to his wife Ann, three unmarried daughters (Georgiana, Edith and Ethel), and eldest son William.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Caroline affair, President Harrison died and Vice-President John Tyler ascended to the presidency. Tyler {{resisted}} Clay's attempts {{to set the}} Whig agenda, and vetoed two bank bills against Crittenden's advice. Crittenden and the other Whigs in Tyler's cabinet—excepting Daniel Webster—resigned in protest of Tyler's deviation from the traditional Whig agenda. Crittenden's resignation was effective September 11, 1841. He returned to Kentucky with no political office and <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>money.</b> A group of his friends in Woodford County purchased his boyhood home and presented it {{to him as a}} gift on his return to Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Johnson taught {{part-time}} at the Nottingham School of Art, {{and managed}} to have Knight enrolled as an 'artisan student' there, paying no fees, aged just 13. At the age of fifteen, and still a student herself, Knight took over her mother's teaching duties when Charlotte {{was diagnosed with cancer}} and became seriously ill. Later Knight won a scholarship and the gold medal in the national student competition held by the then South Kensington Museum. She continued to give private lessons after she left the School of Art, as both she and her sister Evangeline Agnes, known as Sissie, had been left to live alone on <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>money,</b> after the deaths of their mother, their sister Nellie and both their grandmothers. At the School of Art, Laura met {{one of the most promising}} students, Harold Knight, then aged 17, and determined that the best method of learning was to copy Harold's technique. They became friends, and married in 1903.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} growth across South Wales {{drove up the}} demand for new housing for the growing workforce. Bute {{was not prepared to}} sell any of his lands for housing, and did not see much profit in building and renting housing himself, but was prepared to lease land in the growing urban areas and mining communities for land development. Initially, he attempted to negotiate 63 year long leases, which would have given his successors additional, early flexibility in how they managed the land, but these proved unpopular so he reverted to offering the more typical 99-year leases. None of the contracts offered by Bute allowed the lessee to buy the freehold or automatically renew the lease {{at the end of this}} term, which ultimately resulted in substantial political difficulties for the third and fourth marquesses when there was a storm of complaints in the late 19th and early 20th century. Bute left the style of the early developments up to the lessees, but was concerned by the poor results. Bute then began to approve the designs for new buildings personally, laying out some grand streets in the centre of Cardiff and retaining open areas for eventual use as parks. <b>Very</b> <b>little</b> <b>money</b> was invested in the sewage and drainage systems for his new developments, however, and a damning 1850 inquiry showed that this had resulted in cholera outbreaks across the town.|$|E

25|$|A TV film of The Bogie Man {{was made}} in 1992 by BBC Scotland {{starring}} Robbie Coltrane, but was not well received and a series was never made. Wagner and Grant made <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>money</b> out of it. Wagner felt that the screenwriter did a poor job adapting it, and Coltrane {{did not understand the}} character.|$|E
25|$|There were {{problems}} with Oliver Smith's designs. His painted backdrops were stunning, but the sets were, {{for the most}} part, either shabby looking or too stylized.

The couple had some difficulty making their payments and they were constantly receiving reminders and even notices of foreclosure.|$|E
25|$|The {{margining}} of futures eliminates {{much of this}} {{credit risk}} by forcing the holders to update daily {{to the price of}} an equivalent forward purchased that day.

25|$|Once victims {{leave their}} perpetrator, {{they can be}} stunned {{with the reality of}} the extent to which the abuse has taken away their autonomy. Due to {{economic}} abuse and isolation, the victim usually has <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>money</b> of their own and few people on whom they can rely when seeking help. This has been shown to be one of the greatest obstacles facing victims of DV, and the strongest factor that can discourage them from leaving their perpetrators.|$|E

50|$|Many {{players had}} become {{full-time}} professionals during darts' peak {{years in the}} 1980s, and the big sudden drop {{in the amount of}} darts television coverage in 1989 left them with <b>very</b> <b>little</b> prize <b>money</b> to play for. It also meant a lack of exposure, which would make it very tough for them to make a living from exhibition matches. The top players felt that not enough was being done by the BDO to encourage new sponsors into their sport and television coverage should be greater than just one event per year.|$|R

A significant amount of female spectators are attracted to American football in Brazil; even to the point where they go to parties where the football players pretend to speak English. Children between the ages of 8 to 13 are being encouraged by educational organizations to start participating in American football.|$|R
25|$|In 1972, Scorsese {{made the}} Depression-era exploiter Boxcar Bertha for B-movie {{producer}} Roger Corman, who also helped directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, James Cameron, and John Sayles launch their careers. It was Corman who taught Scorsese that entertaining films could be shot with <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>money</b> or time, preparing the young director {{well for the}} challenges to come with Mean Streets. Following the film's release, Cassavetes encouraged Scorsese to make the films {{that he wanted to}} make, rather than someone else's projects.|$|E
25|$|LDDC had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>money,</b> but it {{did have}} three crucial levers to deliver regeneration. First of all it had land ownership: this enabled it to enter into {{commercial}} deals with developers. Secondly it had planning powers: this was a controversial move, which angered local boroughs, but which allowed, for example, the outline planning permission for Canary Wharf to specify only the height and footprint of buildings, enabling the development to move quickly to satisfy demand. Finally LDDC {{had the power to}} broker and enter into contracts.|$|E
25|$|When Horiuchi {{had been}} in the U.S. for about a year, his 45-year-old father died of stomach cancer and his mother {{returned}} to Japan with the three younger children shortly afterwards. Chikamasa and Toshimasa were left with <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>money</b> to live on as they tried to both support their mother and pay off debts which their father had incurred. In 1929, the brothers opened a radio sales and repair shop, but it was soon lost in the Great Depression, and they returned to work on the railroad.|$|E

40|$|The Commission of Enquiry on Occupational Health, {{appointed}} in 1975, published its findings in 1976.

60|$|After {{that there}} was a great {{canvassing}} for votes. Dan Baxter was unusually active, and Jack and Pepper felt certain that he was trying one of his old tricks, namely, that of buying votes. Some of the poorer cadets had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> spending <b>money,</b> {{and it was a great}} temptation to them to have money offered for their ballots. Of course, buying votes was dishonorable, and Baxter had to work on the sly. Ritter also tried to buy votes, but soon found out that very few of the cadets would even listen to him, because of the way he had misled them in the past.|$|R
25|$|In 1979, Dale {{discovered}} a wrecked 1960 Champion 7-GC flipped over and abandoned {{at an airport}} in northern Wisconsin. The brothers then bought the plane from its owner with the <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>money</b> they had and rebuilt it in the shed at their family farmhouse. This was their first experience tinkering with an aircraft as a self-taught restoration project, followed by {{the making of a}} Glasair 1 they saw introduced at the 1980 EAA Convention and Fly-In (now called AirVenture) in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. David Gustafson of Aircraft Spruce reported that the only way the Klapmeier brothers' parents would lend them the money to buy a Glasair was if they wrote up a business plan explaining why constructing a homebuilt would further their professional lives.|$|E
25|$|Seed {{began his}} {{managerial}} career at Clapton Orient. He was tempted {{into the job}} by Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman who told Seed that Arsenal had plans to buy Orient {{and turn them into}} a nursery club for Arsenal. Seed commenced the job at £12 a week but within a short time Arsenal were forced to abandon their plans after being told by the Football League that they were unlawful. Without the financial backing of Arsenal, Orient had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>money</b> and the team struggled. In Seed's first season as manager the team finished 16th and then in the following 1932–33 campaign they avoided having to seek re-election on goal average. In August 1933 he accepted the offer of the manager's job at Charlton Athletic despite Sheffield Wednesday trying to tempt Seed back to Hillsborough as a replacement for the manager Bob Brown.|$|E
25|$|After {{two years}} at Alma College, Hull moved to Hibbing, Minnesota to work as an {{apprentice}} mining engineer. However, after two months he was afflicted by polio, which left him paralyzed with one leg, causing him to recover at his parents home {{for a year and}} forcing him to reconsider his life path. He considered becoming a minister of Unitarianism, because he found their philosophy focused sermons appealing. His love of philosophy eventually led to his interest in Psychology, which he studied during his recovery. He began his journey by reading William James’ book Principles of Psychology. He also took a particular interest in the works of Watson and Pavlov. A little after he started reading, his eyes would become weak and his mother would read to him until his eyes became strong enough for him to read on his own. A year later, he decided to teach back home in the one room school, which had expanded to two-rooms. After his two years teaching, he married Bertha Iutzi with <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} reasons cited for {{the decline of the}} Sans Souci hotel. The first was the {{business}} sense of the owner, Nicholas Low. A New York City native, Nicholas Low sought to import goods from merchants that he knew in New York City and servants from New York City. <b>Very</b> <b>little</b> of the <b>money</b> that the Sans Souci hotel generated during its heyday was used to develop the Town of Ballston Spa.|$|R

5000|$|As {{a result}} of the chaussee, road {{engineering}} standards and the road traffic regulations were also given impetus. Pierer pointed out in 1860: chaussee regulations, which usually specify the weight that a carter can load, the wheel gauge that a cart must have, specify the width of the wheel rims (the 6 inch rims pay either no, or <b>very</b> <b>little,</b> toll <b>money,</b> because they use the chaussee; in other countries narrow rims for goods carts are prohibited), prohibit the blocking of places where it is not absolutely necessary, forbid blocking the track, specify which side of the road to pass (mostly on the right, but on the left in Austria), determine fines for driving on the footpath, etc.|$|R
