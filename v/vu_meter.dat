25|$|In 1966, Shure {{introduced}} the M68, a portable mixer {{capable of being}} battery powered along with available accessories like a carry case and battery power supply specifically designed {{to address the needs}} of broadcast journalists and field recording personnel. The following year, the Shure M67 mixer added an illuminated <b>VU</b> <b>meter</b> and a line level output transformer for connecting the mixer to a telephone line. In August, 1969, Eddie Kramer recorded the 4-day Woodstock Festival using three Shure M67 mixers. Shure's portable mixer line later included other models such as the M267 and 268.|$|E
25|$|News reporting, documentary, {{and human}} {{interest}} broadcast operations often used portable Marantz PMD-series recorders for {{the recording of}} speech interviews. The key advantages of the Marantz portable recorders were the accommodation of professional microphones with an XLR connector, normal and double tape speed recording for extended frequency response, Dolby and dbx noise reduction systems, manual or automatic gain control (AGC) level control, peak limiter, multiple tape formulation accommodation, microphone and line level input connections, unbalanced RCA stereo input and output connections, live or tape monitoring, <b>VU</b> <b>meter,</b> headphone jack, playback pitch control, and operation on AC power or batteries optimized for long duration. Unlike less-expensive portable recorders that were limited to automatic gain control (AGC) recording schemes, the manual recording mode preserved low noise dynamics and avoided the automatic elevation of noise.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>VU</b> <b>meter</b> {{is often}} {{included}} in analog circuit, audio equipment {{to display a}} signal level in Volume Units. It is intentionally a [...] "slow" [...] measurement, averaging out peaks and troughs of short duration to reflect the perceived loudness of the material. It was originally invented in 1939 by the combined effort of Bell Labs and broadcasters CBS and NBC for measuring and standardizing the levels of telephone lines. The instrument used to measure VU is called the volume indicator (VI) instrument. Most users ignore this {{and call it a}} <b>VU</b> <b>meter.</b>|$|E

50|$|Most {{manufacturers}} {{adopted a}} standard top-loading format with piano key controls, dual <b>VU</b> <b>meters,</b> and slider level controls. There was {{a variety of}} configurations leading to the next standard format in the late 1970s, which settled on front-loading (see main picture) with cassette well on one side, dual <b>VU</b> <b>meters</b> on the other, and later dual-cassette decks with meters in the middle. Mechanical controls were replaced with electronic push buttons controlling solenoid mechanical actuators, though low cost models would retain mechanical controls. Some models could search and count gaps between songs.|$|R
2500|$|Adjacent to Studio B was a {{reverberation}} room containing a plate reverb device made by EMT, German makers of similar effects units installed in other recording studios around the world. The EMT reverb was an electro-mechanical echo chamber used to add artificial reverberation effects to recordings. Porter {{arranged to have}} the dedicated echo room cooled down {{as much as possible}} with an air conditioner, and he adjusted the ten springs on the EMT plate to be tighter than usual, in order to feed the plate more audio signal and get a cleaner sound returning from the device. So much signal was being sent to the plate that Porter disconnected the associated <b>VU</b> <b>meter</b> so {{that he would not be}} bothered with its needle slamming against its peg. Porter related that the EMT's springs frequently broke under the increased tension, and he would have to replace them, but that the trouble was worth achieving a [...] "brighter and fuller" [...] echo effect.|$|E

[...] The [...] "v" [...] comes from [...] "volt", while [...] "u" [...] comes from the volume unit used in the <b>VU</b> <b>meter.</b> dBu {{can be used as}} a measure of voltage, regardless of impedance, but is derived from a 600Ω load dissipating 0dBm (1mW).

50|$|A widely {{believed}} myth {{is that the}} PPM was developed as a superior alternative to the <b>VU</b> <b>meter.</b> In fact, the PPM came first, and if anything the <b>VU</b> <b>meter</b> was developed as an economical alternative to the PPM.|$|E
50|$|Key {{features}} of the design are the machine's interchangeable headblock system, which allows the ATR-100 to be converted to run either quarter-inch or half-inch magnetic tape. Ampex was the first company to implement a servo-controlled, direct-drive-capstan tape transport, which allows the tape speed and tension to be continuously monitored by a servo relay. The transport consequently has excellent wow and flutter specifications. The ATR-100 also features dual <b>VU</b> <b>meters,</b> or four <b>VU</b> <b>meters</b> {{in the case of}} the four track models, and a digital tape timer. An optional remote control is also available.|$|R
50|$|In {{broadcasting}} equipment, this is {{termed the}} Maximum Permitted Level, which {{is defined by}} European Broadcasting Union standards. These devices use peak programme <b>meters</b> instead of <b>VU</b> <b>meters,</b> which gives the reading a different meaning.|$|R

5000|$|Since a <b>VU</b> <b>meter</b> is a {{mechanical}} device {{it can never}} reflect the instantaneous signal peaks of complex audio signals. The designers of the <b>VU</b> <b>meter</b> therefore took a different approach. They created a meter that did NOT measure peaks but simply inferred them. A real <b>VU</b> <b>meter</b> has a very specific [...] "ballistic characteristic". This means it responds to changing audio signals at a very precise speed, rising from no signal to 99% of [...] "0VU" [...] when a 1 kHz sine wave tone is applied for 300 milli-seconds.|$|E

5000|$|When using a <b>VU</b> <b>meter,</b> {{the audio}} system is {{calibrated}} with a sine wave tone at a [...] "reference level" [...] for the system. At the reference level, the <b>VU</b> <b>meter</b> shows [...] "0" [...] for a sine wave tone, but the engineer must know that, with music or speech, to always infer that peak levels are always between 6dB to 10dB {{higher than the}} reference level. The usefulness of the <b>VU</b> <b>meter</b> {{comes from the fact}} that for most types of audio sources the system engineer can count on these peaks being within this range and can design the audio system with confidence. Good engineering practice is to always build in a little extra [...] "headroom" [...] as it is called, to cover the strange conditions where an audio signal might exceed normal peak levels or the equipment operator fails to adjust the levels correctly. Typically the levels considered when designing systems using a <b>VU</b> <b>meter</b> are: ...|$|E

50|$|The VU-meter was {{originally}} developed in 1939 by the combined effort of Bell Labs and broadcasters CBS and NBC. In the 1970s-80s, neon-filled, planar dual display dekatrons {{with up to}} 201 segments per stereo channel were popular among broadcasters as fast bar graph <b>VU</b> <b>meters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As a result, {{the common}} {{practice}} of mastering music involved matching the highest peak of a recording at, or close to, digital full scale, and referring to digital levels {{along the lines}} of more familiar analog <b>VU</b> <b>meters.</b> When using <b>VU</b> <b>meters,</b> a certain point (usually −14 dB below the disc's maximum amplitude) was used {{in the same way as}} the saturation point (signified as 0 dB) of analog recording, with several dB of the CD's recording level reserved for amplitude exceeding the saturation point (often referred to as the [...] "red zone", signified by a red bar in the meter display), because digital media cannot exceed 0 decibels relative to full scale (dBFS). The average level of the average rock song during most of the decade was around −16.8 dBFS.|$|R

50|$|To aid {{alignment}} on both <b>VU</b> <b>meters</b> and PPMS, ABC in New York used {{a special}} test signal known as ATS. A 440 Hz tone alternated between steady tone at +8 dBu (indicated at 0 VU and −8 PPM) and tone bursts at +16 dBu (indicated at 0 VU and 0 PPM).|$|R
50|$|Galvanometers {{also had}} {{widespread}} use as the visualising part in {{other kinds of}} analog meters, for example in light <b>meters,</b> <b>VU</b> <b>meters,</b> etc., where {{they were used to}} measure and display the output of other sensors.

2500|$|Since CDs {{were not}} the primary medium for popular music until the late 1980s, there was little {{motivation}} for competitive loudness practices then.

5000|$|Kenwood's {{series of}} [...] "Integrated Amplifier" [...] stereo power amplifiers, {{launched}} in 1977 and produced through the mid-1980s. The design {{for most of}} these items features a true dual-mono path for stereo output (in other words, no electrical components are shared between left- and right-channel amplification). Front plates were typically made in brushed aluminum with aluminum knobs and switches, glass covers, {{and in some cases}} analog <b>VU</b> <b>meters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The second {{amplifier}} released was the Phase Linear 400 with 200 watts per channel. It {{shared the}} same distinctive brushed aluminum, dual <b>VU</b> <b>meters</b> front panel style as the 700. It retailed for just under $500. The next product was the Phase Linear 4000 Series Auto-correlation Pre-Amplifier introduced in 1973 and manufactured through 1978. It retailed for $700.00 {{at the end of}} its life. It was a design collaboration by Bob Carver and Bill Skinner.|$|R

25|$|Stereo {{recorders}} eventually {{evolved into}} high fidelity and {{were known as}} cassette decks, after the reel-to-reel decks. Hi-Fi cassette decks, in contrast to cassette recorders and cassette players, often didn't have built-in amplification or speakers. Many formats of cassette players and recorders have evolved over the years. Initially all were top loading, usually with cassette on one side, and <b>VU</b> <b>meters</b> and recording level controls on the other side. Older models used combinations of levers and sliding buttons for control.|$|R
