50|$|Vinblastine is {{a highly}} potent drug which also has serious side effects {{especially}} on the neurological system. Therefore, new synthetic analogues were developed {{with the goal of}} obtaining more efficient and less toxic drugs. The stereochemical configurations at C-20', C-16' and C-14' in the velbanamine portion are critical and inversion leads to loss of activity. The C-16' carboxymethyl group is important for activity since decarboxylated dimer is inactive. Structural variation at C-15'- C-20' in the velbanamine ring is well tolerated. The upper skeletal modification of vinblastine gave vinorelbine which shows comparable activity as that of vinblastine. Another analogue prepared was the difluoro derivative of vinorelbine which showed improved in vivo antitumor activity. It was discovered that fluorination at C-19' position of vinorelbine dramatically increased the in vivo activity. Most of the SAR studies involve the vindoline portion of bis-indole alkaloids because modification at C-16 and C-17 offers good opportunities for developing new analogues. The replacement of the ester group with an amide group at the C-16 resulted in the development of <b>vindesine.</b> Similarly replacement of the acetyl group at C-16 with L-trp-OC2H5, d-Ala(P)-(OC2H5)2, L-Ala(P)-(OC2H5)2 and I-Vla(P)-(OC2H5)2 gave rise to new analogues having anti- tubulin activity. Also {{it was found that the}} vindoline's indole methyl group is a useful position to functionalize potentially and develop new, potent vinblastine derivatives. A new series of semi-synthetic C-16 -spiro-oxazolidine-1,3-diones prepared from 17-deacetyl vinblastine showed good anti-tubulin activity and lower cytotoxicity. Vinglycinate a glycinate prodrug derived from the C-17-OH group of vinblastine showed similar antitumor activity and toxicity as that of vinblastine.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{aromatic}} retinoid, etretinate and a vinca alkaloid, <b>vindesine</b> were investigated by culture of malignant melanoma cells in vitro with these two agents; either separately or in combination.

Entry of 3 H labelled <b>vindesine</b> or etretinate into drug free cells was followed in the absence or presence of unlabelled drug. It was found that etretinate enhanced cellular uptake of <b>vindesine</b> in two of the cell lines and this may be responsible for the enhanced toxicity of <b>vindesine</b> in the presence of etretinate. The human melanoma which did not exhibit retinoid stimulated <b>vindesine</b> uptake, appeared to be intrinsically sensitive to the vinca alkaloid. No effect on cellular retinoid uptake by <b>vindesine</b> was recorded in any of the melanomas. The results indicate that the intracellular concentrations combined with the intrinsic sensitivities of each cell line to etretinate and <b>vindesine</b> determines the toxic response.

A total of 42 patients with nonresectable NSCLC were included. The median age of patients was 56 years; 57 % were men, 52 % had adenocarcinoma, 31 % squamous cell carcinoma and 17 % had large-cell carcinoma. The performance status ranged from 0 to 2 with 83 % in performance status 1. The majority (55 %) had stage IV disease, while 40 % had stage III B and 5 % stage III A disease. WHO grade 3 – 4 leucopenia occurred in five patients (12 %) and 9 % had grade 4 neutropenia. Thrombocytopenia grade 3 – 4 was observed in six patients (15 %).

In patients older than 70 years, and in those who received prior irradiation or chemotherapy, cisplatin and 5 -FU were omitted on day 4. Courses were repeated every 4 weeks and evaluation of response was performed after the first 2 courses. In case of response, treatment was continued until best response or untolerable toxicity. Among 182 eligible patients, 75 % had received no prior therapy; 41 % had locoregional disease and 59 % metastatic disease; 41 % lost more than 5 % of their pretherapy body weight. A 34 % objective response rate was observed in the 164 evaluable patients (31 % in all the eligible patients) including 4 complete and 52 partial responses. Patients with locoregional disease had a significantly better response rate than those with metastases (44 % vs 27 %). The overall median survival was 26 weeks. Significant hematological toxicity was documented but the most serious adverse event was the occurrence of 18 (10 %) cardiac or sudden deaths. These toxic deaths were significantly associated with a 5 % loss of body weight prior to therapy.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{development of}} a soft agar clonogenic assay for human tumor stem cells provides an in vitro technique {{with a high degree}} of accuracy for predicting in vivo clinical response to standard anticancer drugs. We used this system to conduct an "in vitro phase II trial" in human ovarian cancer and melanoma. This approach can potentially identify active phase I [...] II drugs suitable for treatment of given tumor types for specific patients and eliminates the need to subject patients (who would be predicted not to respond) to toxic side effects. In vitro sensitivity for new agents was operationally defined as at least a 70 % reduction of tumor colony-forming units (TCFU) at concentrations which are readily achievable pharmacologically. The new agents AMSA and <b>vindesine</b> (as well as vinblastine) appeared to have activity in melanoma, while PALA and thymidine were inactive. Pentamethylmelamine, mitomycin C, methyl-GAG, and AMSA were relatively ineffective in ovarian cancer. Vinblastine and <b>vindesine</b> had definite activity. The human tumor stem cell assay may thus provide the basis for a useful alternative to the current clinical phase II testing approach for identifying antitumor activity of new agents. Validation of this concept with correlative in vitro and in vivo phase II trials of new agents in patients with tumor types predicted to be sensitive is clearly warranted...|$|E
40|$|Summary Lung tumours of non {{small cell}} {{pathology}} were cultured by clonogenic assay in several media. Culture {{was successful in}} spleen conditioned medium, but only 57 % grew and low plating efficiencies (PE) meant that only 23 % of the original number produced significant drug results. Comparison of rat erythrocyte lysate (REL) medium with serum free defined medium (HITES) and HITES + 10 % FBS demonstrated clear enhancement of PE in REL although growth was 100 % successful in all these media. Ninety-three percent of samples tested against drugs in REL produced significant results. A later comparison of REL with McCoy's SA+rbc+hydrocortisone produced relatively poor culture success for these 3 media and equivocal growth patterns. Low PE was attributed to age of rats used for rbc. <b>Vindesine</b> and cis-platinum cytotoxicity in spleen conditioned medium were 61 % and 15 % sensitivity respectively. These do not concur with clinical experience but the figures for overt resistance, at 39 % and 69 %, correspond with expected non-responders to these regimes. Drug testing in REL produced figures correlating more closely with clinical performance at 45 % sensitivity to platinum and 36 % of patients sensitive to both drugs, but the <b>vindesine</b> sensitivity at 55 % is again discrepant with performance of this drug as a single agent.

40|$|A phase II {{protocol}} associating <b>vindesine</b> and prednisone {{was used}} in 47 hematological patients of whom 40 were evaluable. The best results were achieved in relapses of childhood's ALL, with {{a high proportion of}} complete remissions and in blastic crises of CML. The efficacy appeared less in relapses of ALL in adults and of malignant lymphoma. The other cases seemed not to respond favorably. The hematological toxicity consisted of leucopenia generally of short duration, but sometimes severe. The neurological toxicity was little and led to reduction of the dosage in only two adults with preexisting neuropathy...|$|E
40|$|The {{randomized}} HD 2000 trial compared six {{cycles of}} ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine), four escalated plus two standard cycles of BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone), and six cycles of COPP-EBV-CAD (cyclophosphamide, lomustine, <b>vindesine,</b> melphalan, prednisone, epidoxorubicin, vincristine, procarbazine, vinblastine, and bleomycin; CEC) {{in patients with}} advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma. After a median follow-up of 42 months, patients who received BEACOPP {{were reported to have}} experienced better progression-free survival (PFS) but not better overall survival (OS) results than those receiving ABVD. We here report a post hoc analysis of this trial after a median follow-up of 10 years...|$|E
40|$|International audienceVinblastine and {{vincristine}} are dimeric indole alkaloids {{derived from}} (formerly:). Their monomeric precursor molecules are vindoline and catharanthine. While vinblastine and vincristine are well-known mitotic spindle poisons, not much {{is known about}} vindoline and catharanthine. Vindoline and catharanthine showed weak cytotoxicity, while vinblastine, vincristine, and the semisynthetic <b>vindesine</b> and vinorelbine revealed high cytotoxicity towards cancer cells. This may reflect a general biological principle of poisonous plants. Highly toxic compounds are not only active towards predators, but also towards plant tissues. Hence, plants need mechanisms {{to protect themselves from}} their own poisons. One evolutionary strategy to solve this problem is to generate less toxic precursors, which are dimerized to toxic end products when needed. As shown by molecular docking and biochemical approaches, vinblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine bound with high affinity to α?β-tubulin and inhibited tubulin polymerization, whereas the effects of vindoline and catharanthine were weak. Similarly, vinblastine produced high fractions of mono- and multipolar mitotic spindles, while vindoline and catharanthine did only weakly affect bipolar mitotic spindle formation. Inhibition of centrosomal clustering represents a treatment novel strategy leading to multipolar spindle formation and apoptosis. This has been shown for vinblastine by us for the first time. P-glycoprotein-overexpressing multidrug-resistant CEM/VCR 1000 cells were highly resistant towards vincristine and cross-resistant to vinblastine, <b>vindesine,</b> and vinorelbine, but not or only weakly cross-resistant to vindoline and catharanthine. In addition to tubulin as primary target, microarray-based mRNA signatures of responsiveness of these compounds have been identified by COMPARE and signaling pathway profiling...|$|E
40|$|Summary Twenty-seven {{patients}} with disseminated malignant melanoma were treated monthly with cisplatin (CDDP) 120 mg m 2 on day 1, <b>vindesine</b> (VDS) 3 mg m- 2 on day 2 and dacarbazine (DTIC) 250 mg m- 2 on days 2 - 6. None {{of them had}} received prior chemotherapy. All patients are evaluable for response and toxicity. There were five (19 %) complete (CR) and seven (26 %) partial (PR) responses for a total response rate of 45 %. We conclude {{that the combination of}} DTIC, VDS and CDDP is capable of producing a relatively high rate of response in {{patients with}} advanced metastatic malignant melanoma, but responses are short. There is documented activity of <b>vindesine</b> (VDS) (Retsas et al., 1980) and dacarbazine (DTIC) (Comis, 1976; Constanzi, 1976; Pritchard et al., 1981) as single agents or in combination in malignant melanoma with objective response rates of 15 - 42 % (Einhorn et al., 1974; Hill et al., 1984; Retsas et al., 1985). Numerous {{attempts have been made to}} increase the response rate by combining various drugs. However, there is no evidence that any particular combination has improved these results (Einhorn et al., 1974; Karakousis et al., 1979). Cisplatin (CDDP) alone or in combination with other active agents has been tried in patients with advanced malignant melanoma and has resulted in a wide range of remission rates (Chary et al., 1977; Nathanson et al., 1981; Al-Sarraf et al. ...|$|E
40|$|Nineteen evaluable {{patients}} with advanced malignant melanoma {{have been treated}} {{with a combination of}} cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 given as a 24 -hr infusion on day 1 and <b>vindesine</b> 3 mg/m 2 i. v. push on days 1, 8 and 15. Courses are repeated every 4 weeks. One complete and six partial responses have been achieved for an overall response rate of 37 %. Effectiveness of this regimen seems to be unaffected by prior chemotherapy and visceral involvement. Median response duration has not yet been reached. Toxicity has been generally moderate, consisting mainly of gastro-intestinal intolerance. Further accrual and longer follow-up are needed to assess this regimen.
