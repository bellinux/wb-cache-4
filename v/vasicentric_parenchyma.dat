40|$|Sassafrasoxylon gottwaldii sp. nov. {{is a new}} taxon for fossil {{wood with}} a suite of {{features}} diagnostic of Sassafras Nees & Eberm. of the Lauraceae. The fossil wood described is from Late Cretaceous (Santonian- Maastrichtian) sediments of the northern Antarctica Peninsula region. This new species of Sassafrasoxylon Brezinová et Süss resembles the species of extant Sassafras in being distinctly ring-porous, having vessel elements with simple perforation plates and very occasional scalariform plates with relatively few bars in the narrowest latewood vessels, alternate intervascular pitting, marginal (initial) parenchyma bands and paratracheal <b>vasicentric</b> <b>parenchyma</b> in the latewood, multiseriate rays and oil and /or mucilage cells. The fossils were found as isolated pieces of wood and therefore it is not certain whether the parent plant was Sassafras- like in all characters. Consequently the fossils {{have been placed in}} an organ genus rather than in extant Sassafras. This is the oldest record of an organ with features closest to extant Sassafras and may suggest that Sassafras first appeared in Gondwana and later radiated into the Northern Hemisphere. The distribution of extant Sassafras in North America and East Asia may represent a relict of a geographically more widespread taxon in the past...|$|E
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} the single species of Plakothira, a {{recently}} discovered genus from the Marquesas Islands, is described qualitatively and quantitatively. Features new for the family include presence of <b>vasicentric</b> scanty axial <b>parenchyma</b> and presence of perforated ray cells. Plakothira has several wood features specialized for Loasaceae: <b>vasicentric</b> axial <b>parenchyma,</b> extremely reduced borders on fibertracheids, and storying in fiber-tracheids. Wood of Plakothira is clearly loasaceous. Storying in fibertracheids is reported here for the loasaceous genera Fuertesia and Mentzelia. Wood anatomy of Plakothira represents paedomorphosis in great length of vessel elements, erectness of ray cells, lack of change in large primary rays, and in presence of occasional scalariform perforation plates. Plakothira has wood features maximally mesomorphic for the family, correlating with its cloud-forest habitat and semisucculent wood and cortex structure...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{describes}} the wood anatomy of Heterothalamus alienus and Heterothalamus rupestris (Astereae - Asteraceae), {{as part of}} the secondary xylem study in the named genus. For the two species it was recorded some features usually mentioned in the literature for the Asteraceae, as typically small vessels, grouped in a dendritic pattern, the presence of only simple perforation plates and of paratracheal parenchyma. Heterothalamus alienus shows spiral thickenings in the wood vessels and storied <b>vasicentric</b> axial <b>parenchyma.</b> Heterothalamus rupestris differs itself by the absence of spiral thickenings in wood vessels and by no storied axial <b>parenchyma,</b> in paratracheal <b>vasicentric</b> to unilateral patterns. Photomicrographs, quantitative data of anatomical features and a comparison between the two species of wood are also provided...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} Holmskioldia sanguinea Retz. {{has been done}} to study the {{structural}} variations in stem and root wood and to correlate them with growth habit and ecology of the plant. Vessels are wider and more abundant while rays (uni- to triserate) are taller in stem wood than in root wood, which possesses broad multiseriate rays. Simple perforation plate, sparse <b>vasicentric</b> paratracheal <b>parenchyma</b> and perforated ray cells are the features common in both stem and root woods, while helical thickenings have been recorded only in the stem wood. Lower value of vulnerability, presence of wider vessels with simple perforation plate, and presence of helical thickening are indicators of wood xeromorphy in Holmskioldia sanguinea. Features like wider vessels and extensive height of rays in stem wood are in consonance with the climbing nature of the stem axis...|$|R
40|$|Species of Tachigali Aubl. have {{potential}} for reforestation and biofuel projects. However, {{information about the}} wood anatomy ofthis species is still very embryonic, hampering identification work. The objective {{of this study was}} to anatomically characterize sevenspecies of Tachigali available in the Walter. A. Egler wood collection of the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi, thereby facilitating future identification work. The following species were studied: T. froesii (Pires) L. F. Gomes da Silva & H. C. Lima, T. melanocarpa (Ducke) Van Der Weff, T. paniculata Aubl., T. paraensis (Huber) Barneby, T. reticulosa (Dwyer) Zarucchi & Herend., T. setifera (Ducke) Zarucchi & Herend e T. tinctoria Bent. var. tinctoria (Benth.) Zarucchi & Herend. Analyses followed standard wood anatomy techniques and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). All species except T. froesii and T. melanocarpa present uniseriate and homogeneous rays, with the exceptions being heterogeneous. A <b>vasicentric</b> paratraqueal <b>parenchyma</b> is present in all the species, combined with another type of parenchyma. The pores are predominantly solitary, except in T. melanocarpa and T. reticulosa which have multiple pores. Tachigali froesii was the only species that presented enclosed bast and calcium carbonate crystals. The composition and organization of the ray cells, allied to the axial type of parenchyma, is important in distinguishing the peculiarity of each species...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} wood features are reported for 38 species representing 22 genera, including the scandent genera Mendoncia and Thunbergia. Woods of Acanthaceae {{are characterized by}} relatively narrow vessels with simple perforation plates and alternate lateral wall pitting, septate libriform fibers, scanty <b>vasicentric</b> axial <b>parenchyma,</b> rays both multiseriate and uniseriate, erect ray cells abundant in rays (some species rayless or near-rayless), numerous small crystals or cystoliths in ray cells in a few genera (first documented reports of both characters in woods of Acanthaceae), and nonstoried structure. This constellation of features is very closely matched by woods of Gesneriaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Pedaliaceae, Martyniaceae, Bignoniaceae, and Myoporaceae (families listed in order ofdecreasing resemblance). Narrowness ofvessels in tropical Acanthaceae appears related to understory ecology. A few species in warm and seasonally dry areas have narrow, short vessel elements numerous per unit transection. Vasicentric tracheids occur in two nonscandent genera in dry areas. Vessel grouping is roughly proportional to dryness of habitat. Thunbergia alata, T. laurifolia, and all collections of Mendoncia have interxylary phloem (first report for Mendoncia). That feature, plus presence of occasional acicular crystals in rays and axial parenchyma and presence of large gelatinous fibers in phloem ally Mendoncia closely with Thunbergia, and Mendonciaceae is not justified for this and other reasons. Species of Thunbergia differ among themselves, and T. erecta and T. holstii resemble shrubby Acanthaceae {{more than they do}} Mendoncia in wood features. Thunbergia thus should not be segregated from Acanthaceae...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{collections}} representing {{one species}} each of Symbolanthus and Tachia, and 17 species of Macrocarpaea were studied {{by means of}} light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Wood details show that the three genera form a coherent group; Tachia differs from the others {{in only a few}} minor characters. Because the species studied form a natural group, wood variations within Helieae offer the basis for correlations and interpretations with respect to habit and ecology. Diameter of stems studied proves to be an important variable that must be taken into account. Correlations with stem diameter include wider vessels in outer wood of wider samples. This would correspond to deeper penetration of reliable water tables by roots of helioid trees or large shrubs. Ray height decreases with increase in stem diameter, an indication of paedomorphosis. Rays of all species are paedomorphic in histology by virtue of relative paucity or even absence of procumbent cells in multiseriate rays. Pseusoscalariform lateral wall pitting of vessels is also a feature characteristic of paedomorphosis. The assemblage of paedomorphic features correlates well with the conclusion, reached by authors who used cladistic methods, that Gentianaceae other than Gentianeae are derived from suffrutescent prennials. The Mesomorphy Ratio, which incorporates three vessel features, correlates with leaf length and with stem diameter. All Helieae are mesophytic, but to various degrees. Septate fiber-tracheids, where present, are typically near vessels and form a substitute for or an addendum to <b>vasicentric</b> axial <b>parenchyma</b> as a mechanism for photosynthate storage. Vestured pits occur on lateral wall pits of vessels of all Helieae, but not on the fibertracheids. Vestured pits show diversity within Macrocarpaea, a feature of possible systematic significance...|$|R
40|$|Anatomical  and Physical Properties of Mindi Wood (Melia azedarach Linn) from Community Forest in Yogyakarta Information about mindi wood {{characteristics}} is {{very limited}} while utilisation of this wood on our society is very extensive. Better knowledge on anatomical and physical wood properties of mindi wood optimizes its utilization. Therefore, this study aims to identify anatomical (macroscopic and microscopic) and physical (moisture content, specific gravity and dimensional changes) wood properties of mindi taken from community forests around Yogyakarta. The macroscopic structural characteristics results showed that annual ring appeared clearly at transversal surface, having single vessel, <b>vasicentric</b> and diffuse <b>parenchyma,</b> rough texture, straight fiber direction, and no resin canal. Cell proportion of wood showed that fibers occupy more than 44 %, followed by vessel (20 %), parenchyma (19 %) and rays (15 %). Wood fiber dimension showed fiber length of 0. 83 mm, fiber diameter of 14. 57 µ, and cell wall thickness of 2. 50 µ. Physical wood properties showed that mindi has 31 % moisture content and 0. 416 of basic specific gravity. Wood shrinkage from green to kilndry on longitudinal was 3. 94 %, tangensial 5. 74 %, and radial 2. 60 %, with T/R ratio 2. 38. Based on T/R ratio value, mindi wood is not recommended for wood construction due to its low dimensional stability. Furthermore, mindi wood also has high longitudinal wood shrinkage and low specific gravity indicating juvenility...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} features are presented for 28 collections of three genera (Bontia, Eremophila, Myoporum); data on Oftia are also included {{since it is}} sometimes referred to Myoporaceae. Wood of all Myoporaceae represents variation on a basic plan: woods diffuse porous or semi-ringporous; vessels with simple perforation plates; lateral wall pits of vessels alternate and circular, with grooves interconnecting some pit apertures; vessels grouped to various degrees into radial multiples; imperforate tracheary elements all fiber-tracheids with pit cavities 1 - 5 μm in diameter (wider on contacts with ray cells), nonseptate; axial <b>parenchyma</b> <b>vasicentric</b> scanty plus, in some species, tangential para tracheal bands (sometimes terminal); rays multi seriate plus uniseriate (uniseriate almost exclusively in two species of Eremophila); ray cells procumbent exclusively, upright and square in uniseriate rays and in tips of multiseriate rays; rays storied in some species of Eremophila, axial parenchyma variously storied; crystals present in ray cells of some species of Eremophila and in fibers of E. polyclada; amorphous deposits and starch often present in parenchyma. Ofiia differs from Myoporaceae by having: septate libriform fibers rather than fiber-tracheids; large pits on vessel walls; axial parenchyma nearly absent; and erect cells predominant in rays. Oftia may be placed in Scrophulariaceae. Leucophyllum differs from Myoporaceae by having: helical thickenings in vessels; vasicentric tracheids transitional from vascular tracheids; scarce axial parenchyma; and erect cells predominant in rays. Leucophyllum may be excluded from Myoporaceae. Wood anatomy ofMyoporaceae shows relationship between Myoporaceae, Scrophulariaceae, and Gesneriaceae, and is also indicative of derivation from woody ancestors. Wood of Myoporaceae reflects xeromorphy, especially in Eremophila, but the foliar apparatus may partially preempt the role of wood in promoting safety, which is connoted by growth rings, narrow and numerous vessels, and grouped vessels...|$|R
