50|$|There {{are several}} short-acting β2 {{agonists}} available including salbutamol (<b>Ventolin)</b> and terbutaline. They provide some relief of symptoms {{for four to}} six hours. Long-acting β2 agonists such as salmeterol, formoterol and indacaterol are often used as maintenance therapy. Some feel the evidence of benefits is limited while others view the evidence of benefit as established. Long-term use appears safe in COPD with adverse effects include shakiness and heart palpitations. When used with inhaled steroids they {{increase the risk of}} pneumonia. While steroids and LABAs may work better together, it is unclear if this slight benefit outweighs the increased risks. Indacaterol requires an inhaled dose once a day, and is as effective as the other long-acting β2 agonist drugs that require twice-daily dosing for people with stable COPD.|$|E

40|$|Generic {{substitution}} of salbutamol lags behind {{that of other}} drugs in Scotland and a negative perception by both patients and doctors may explain this. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess whether, in clinical practice, there was any difference in efficacy between branded salbutamol (<b>Ventolin)</b> and a generic preparation. Asthmatic patients using a <b>Ventolin</b> metered-dose inhaler at least twice a day for symptom relief were entered into a double-blind cross-over study, comparing <b>Ventolin,</b> blinded <b>Ventolin</b> and a generic salbutamol in random order for two weeks each. Daily peak flows, inhaler use and bronchodilator response were recorded. At the end of each treatment period patients rated their inhaler against their usual <b>Ventolin</b> on a 5 -point scale. Forty patients were entered into the study; 90 % received 1000 micrograms or more of inhaled steroids per day. Eleven patients dropped out during the run-in phase. In the remaining 29 patients, no significant difference between treatments could be found in any of the objective parameters measured. Fifty-five per cent of patients said they could detect a difference between the inhalers, and 45 % noted a difference between their usual <b>Ventolin</b> and the open or blinded <b>Ventolin.</b> This study showed clinical equivalence between a generic and branded salbutamol.

40|$|Background and Objective: Acute bronchiolitis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common reasons for inflammation, small airways obstruction, and lower {{respiratory}} tract infection in infancy. Owing that there has been no study on the efficacy of hypersaline 3 % in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis in Iran, the present study was undertaken to deal with this issue. Materials and Methods: This double-blinded clinical trial was carried out in Hajar Hospital of Shahrekord in 2013 - 2014. 70 patients under 2 years of age with bronchiolitis were assigned to two groups of 35 each. The first group received nebulized <b>Ventolin</b> while the second group was given nebulized hypersaline 3 % three times a day. Subsequent to these administrations, recovery duration was compared in both groups. Results: The mean and standard deviation of recovery duration in the <b>Ventolin</b> group was 4. 14 ± 0. 9 days and in the hypersaline 3 % group was 3. 06 ± 0. 6 days. T-test and mean recovery duration was significantly lower in the hypersaline 3 % group (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Nebulizer hypersaline 3 % had a better therapeutic effect than <b>Ventolin</b> in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis. Therefore, the use of this drug, rather than <b>Ventolin,</b> is recommended for the treatment of acute bronchiolitis in children under two years of age. © 2016, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences and Health Services.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The 30 {{minute and}} 24 hour post-inhalation urinary {{excretion}} of salbutamol represents the relative amount of drug {{deposited in the}} lungs and total systemic absorption, respectively. Using this method two metered dose inhalers used with a Volumatic (Allen and Hanburys Ltd, UK) large volume spacer have been compared. METHOD [...] Eleven healthy volunteers inhaled 4 x 100 micrograms salbutamol from either a generic salbutamol (Baker Norton, UK) or <b>Ventolin</b> (Allen and Hanburys Ltd, UK) metered dose inhaler with a Volumatic. The order of administration was randomised with a seven day washout period. Urine samples were collected for 0 - 30 minutes and then pooled up to 24 hours after inhalation. RESULTS [...] The mean (SD) urinary salbutamol excretion 30 minutes after inhalation with the metered dose inhalers used with the Volumatic was 22. 22 (4. 63) and 21. 30 (5. 91) micrograms for the Baker Norton and <b>Ventolin</b> respectively, with a mean difference (95 % confidence interval (CI)) of 0. 92 (- 0. 65 to 2. 49) micrograms.

40|$|Class of 2015 AbstractObjectives: American {{residents}} {{travel to}} Mexico to purchase medications, like albuterol inhalers, for 1 / 3 to 1 / 5 of the US price without prescription requirements. A previous bioequivalence study found clinical differences (P less than 0. 05) between <b>Ventolin</b> and Assal, two Mexican manufactured albuterol inhaler brands. What other differences are there among such inhalers when we test more brands and analyze pharmaceutical qualities like respirable mass? This study seeks {{to provide some}} reasonable expectations for a medical tourist of Mexico who purchases albuterol metered dose inhalers (MDIs) by comparing the product performance {{of some of the}} brands available to the consumers in Mexico. Methods: This study examined the performance of albuterol MDIs obtained from pharmacies in Nogales, Mexico. At least two units were purchased for each of the following brands: Xeneric-S, Victory, <b>Ventolin</b> (GlaxoSmithKline), Assal, and Sacrusyt. At least two lot numbers of each brand were included, with the exception of Sacrusyt, for which a second lot was unavailable at the purchase times. Sample MDIs were compared to US-purchased albuterol inhalers, Proventil and <b>Ventolin.</b> Total dose and respirable mass were determined for each MDI. These parameters were measured by actuating each inhaler into a USP throat, coupled to a cascade impactor, which separates drug particles based on aerodynamic particle size. Particles with an aerodynamic diameter larger than 4. 7 micrometers are considered non-respirable, while particles less than 4. 7 micrometers are considered respirable and the total of respirable and non-respirable particles is the respirable mass. The total dose delivered is determined by calculating the amount of drug that deposits onto the throat and the impactor. Quantification of albuterol was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In brief, the HPLC assay utilized an Apollo C 18 column with a mobile phase of 1 percent phosphoric acid:methanol (77 : 23) at a flow rate of 0. 75 mL/min; UV detection was at 225 nm. Results: Every inhaler was sold in a Spanish-labeled box containing a single page instruction insert and every inhaler label had a visible lot number, expiration date, and noted a 100 microgram dose. Listed manufacturing locations included China, Mexico, India, and Spain. All of the MDIs were purchased for about 3 to 5 each except for non-US <b>Ventolin</b> (10 - 20 each). The measurements of total dose and respirable mass among the five Mexican purchased brands of inhalers varied widely. The MDIs’ average total doses ranged from 57 to 75 micrograms per actuation, while the average total dose of the US purchased MDIs was 79 to 82 micrograms. The respirable mass of the non-US MDIs was more similar. Among the study MDIs, respirable mass ranged from 28 to 41 micrograms, which compares to 38 to 42 micrograms for the two US branded albuterol inhalers. To further investigate the variability among the study MDIs, student t-tests were performed to compare the mean respirable mass for each brand to that of the other four brands. All comparisons were significantly different (p less than 0. 05) except for two (Sacrusyt vs Assal, p equals 0. 89; Xeneric vs <b>Ventolin,</b> p equals 0. 98). Conclusions: Since significant pharmaceutical variability was found among the albuterol MDIs evaluated in this study, clinicians and patients should be conscious of possible differences in quality, therapeutic efficacy, and safety for albuterol MDIs obtained in Mexico. Sample MDIs compared to each other were statistically different in total dose and respirable mass. Thus a patient who has used US MDIs before can’t necessarily expect to get the same dose from non-US brands...|$|E
