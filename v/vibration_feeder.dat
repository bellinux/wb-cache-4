40|$|Abstract. The {{vibration}} {{characteristics of}} inertial vibration feeders were analyzed. Combining active with passive vibration isolation, the hybrid vibration isolation of inertial vibration feeders was researched. Adopting the passive vibration isolation, the vibration transmissibility {{can be reduced}} effectively, but the work efficiency of the inertial <b>vibration</b> <b>feeder</b> is reduced too. By choosing right feedback variables and appropriate feedback gain, the vibration transmissibility and the work efficiency of the inertial <b>vibration</b> <b>feeder</b> can be improved markedly by the hybrid vibration isolation. When the velocity feedback gain {{is equal to the}} upper damping coefficient and the displacement feedback gain is equal to the upper spring stiffness, the inertial <b>vibration</b> <b>feeder</b> has the best work efficiency and the vibration transmissibility approximates zero. The fuzzy PID control approach was used to design the active vibration control system. The simulation results show that the developed active vibration control system has good control performance...|$|E
40|$|A {{piezoelectric}} <b>vibration</b> <b>feeder</b> with {{a magnetic}} spring {{is discussed in}} this paper. The feeder can keep resonance frequency relatively stable under changing loading. Through the analysis on the working principle and magnetic spring stiffness characteristic of this feeder, the dynamic model was established and the relationship among system resonance frequency, loading and magnetic spring stiffness was obtained. The analysis showed that, as the loading changed, the magnetic spring stiffness changed accordingly, which maintained a trend of stability in the system resonance frequency. A prototype was made for the experiment, and the relationship among the loading, magnetic spring axial clearance and system resonance frequency was obtained. The result showed that, when the loading changes, the resonance frequency and feeding speed tended to be stable, which matched the theoretical analysis. Through comparison with a traditional <b>vibration</b> <b>feeder,</b> within nominal loading, this new feeder has more stable resonance frequency and feeding speed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The present electromagnetic/piezoelectric <b>vibration</b> <b>feeder</b> can’t be {{compressed}} {{along the}} height direction, {{and the application}} is limited {{because of the small}} assembly area. Therefore, a new structure piezoelectric <b>vibration</b> <b>feeder</b> was brought up in this paper, which had cirque piezoelectric vibrator for vertical driving, and the dimension of the height can be reduced to below 30 % of the present feeder. Based on the structure character of the feeder, the vibration model was built up, and the calculation method of the system resonance frequency, the stiffness matching relationship of the supporting spring and piezoelectric vibrator were confirmed through theoretical analysis and experimental research. Experiments were done to the prototypes, which turned out that, under the sine voltage of 220 V, the feeder could have 0. 5 kg stuff for experiment (samples), which were columns with dimension Φ 3 mm× 5 mm, and the feeding speed can be up to 145 mm/s. The measured resonance frequency was 187 Hz, which had high coherency with theoretical calculation value...|$|E
40|$|Through the {{development}} of innovative in-line mineral quantification sensors, the possibility has arisen to apply modern control theory to implement automatic process control for electrostatic high tension (“HT”) roll separators. A pilot-scale set-up was constructed to enable continuous tests to be carried out. A typical dry mill feed was continuously pre-heated and separated with a modern lab scale HT roll machine. The mineralogy as well as mass-flow of the non-conductor stream was quantified in-line, and the combined streams were re-circulated in an endless loop {{by a combination of}} <b>vibration</b> <b>feeders</b> and a bucket elevator. A fractional factorial experiment was executed to determine the most significant control parameters of the HT roll separator. Then a multi-input, multi-output dynamic model of the HT electrostatic separator was extracted by the application of standard system identification techniques for automatic control. The most important control variable to ensure a stable product grade could be identified. This allowed a robust single-input, single-output controller to be implemented. The process variable and set-point was mineral grade and the control variable was electrode voltage. Roll speed was manually adjusted while the mineral grade was kept on set-point by the control system. The roll speed, where maximum mass flow and therefore maximum yield was produced on-grade, could therefore be rapidly determined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Vibratory bowl feeders are {{the most}} popular type of part feeders. They handle {{component}} parts {{with a wide range of}} shapes and sizes, made of any kind of material, from all areas of industry. They are useful for automatic feeding, providing a consistent and accurate flow of components and orienting them in proper feeding positions. The vibratory bowl executes a complex helical motion, depending on the driving force and the elastic suspension. The elastic suspension is mainly of the leaf spring type. It has a great influence on the dynamic behavior of the vibratory bowl feeder and generally on its performance. This paper presents a model for the dynamic calculus of a vibratory bowl feeder, having electromagnetic drive and leaf spring elastic suspension. The differential equations, which describe the motion of the bowl, are deduced and solved by analytical methods. Key-Words:- <b>vibration,</b> vibratory <b>feeders,</b> mechanical model...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGrain loss sensor is an {{important}} monitoring module to realize the intelligent automatic control in combine harvester. Polyvinylidene fluoride piezoelectricity film {{has been one of}} the most widely used macromolecule materials at present. Based on its piezoelectric effect, in this paper, a grain loss monitoring system for combine harvester by using the PVDF sensor was designed. The system is composed of the PVDF sensor, intelligent display, SCM and so on. The working principle was analyzed and the measuring accuracy was dynamic calibrated in laboratory. The polyvinylidene fluoride piezoelectricity film was selected as the sensing material and the signal processing circuit was mainly composed by charge amplifier, band-pass filter. In order to verify the accuracy of the sensor, the dynamic calibration experiments were carried out. By adjustment of the <b>feeder's</b> <b>vibration</b> parameters, the different feeding velocity can be gained. In the dynamic calibration experiments, the sensor was fixed at the height of 19. 5 mm and the fixing angle of 33 °~ 35 °, the feeding velocity of 60   80 grain per second, 1000 samples of full grain were randomly selected in the experiments, and the results indicated the detecting error was less than 5. 7 %. Using the different mixture ratio of the full grain, the imperfect grain, short stalk to do multi-group experiments, the result shows that the sensor can distinguish the grain from the mixture stalks. In the rig-tests, the monitoring sensor was fixed on the caudal region of the cylinder concave grid of the combine harvester in order to monitor the threshing compounds. The precision error of the monitoring sensor in combine is less than 8 % through field experiments. So this advanced sensor can realize the aim of monitoring the entrainment loss in combine harvester...|$|R

40|$|Development of a <b>vibration</b> <b>feeder</b> was {{performed}} as one {{application of a}} vibratory machine with a self-contained vibration-reducing function by means of interference of transmissive force. The most important conditions for a vibration proof of a vibratory machine are compatibility of functions which oppose each other, reduction of transmissive force on the machine base and amplification of vibration on the body. This study deals with application of the proposed design to the feeder. The machine consists of coupling {{of a pair of}} one-degree-of-freedom mass-spring system. An excitation spring is devided {{as a part of a}} coupling spring for generation of excitation force on the two bodies. One end of the spring is excited by harmonic displacement with a reciprocating mechanism such as a crank.

40|$|Jet milling is an ultragrinding {{process in}} order to produce superfine powders with {{increased}} functionalities. The effect of milling pressure, feed rate, <b>vibration</b> rate of <b>feeder,</b> and feedback of jet milling on whole wheat flour functionality and the potential of those flours for breadmaking with the goal of improving bread quality and digestibility were investigated. Increasing milling pressure (from 4 to 8  bar), decreasing feed rate (from 0. 67 to 5. 18  kg/h), and/or using recirculation augmented the severity of the process and reduced flour particle size from 84. 15 to 17. 02  μm. Breakage of aleurone particle layer and the reduction of particle size in jet milled flours were detected using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Ash and protein content did not change after jet milling. However, total fiber content and digestible starch increased from 13. 01 to 14. 72  % and from 33. 80 to 43. 23  mg/ 100  mg, respectively, when subjected to jet milling at 8 -bar air pressure. Mixolab® data indicated that water absorption increased from 64. 1 to 68. 0  %, while pasting temperature decreased from 63. 4 to 66. 1  °C owing to the milling intensity. Referring to bread, jet milled flour addition reduced the specific volume from 2. 50 to 1. 90  cm 3 /g, luminosity from 60. 48 to 55. 87, and moisture content from 35. 78 to 33. 49  %, and increased crumb hardness from 707 to 1808  g. Jet milled breads presented a slight decrease in estimated glycemic index (eGI) (from 86 to 81), suggesting that jet milling treatment could also have nutritional benefits.

40|$|Vibratory bowl feeders {{are often}} used for {{conveying}} and feeding small spare parts in automatic assembly systems. They consist of a bowl connected to a base by three or four inclined leaf springs. The springs constrain the bowl so that its vertical displacement causes a coupled rotation around its vertical symmetry axis. One or more electromagnets generate the sinusoidal force which drives the bowl; commonly, they are either vertically or tangentially housed between the base and the bowl. This force induces {{the movement of the}} spare parts along the inner spiral track of the bowl. Rubber mounts are located under the base in order to isolate the <b>feeder</b> <b>vibration</b> from the floor. The feeding velocity of the parts is influenced by the vibration amplitude of the bowl. Most vibratory feeders are used at the resonant or near-resonant frequency of the mechanical system in order to improve feeding efficiency. Furthermore, direction, amplitude and frequency of the oscillations depend on the design parameters of the feeder. In the literature, a number of theoretical and/or experimental studies have been reported for this device (see for instance [1, 2]). Moreover, other works have addressed the analysis of the spare parts’ motion through numerical models (see, for example, [3, 4]). Beside a simple construction, the main disadvantages of these feeders are the noise generation as well as the induced vibrations on the surroundings during operation. In this sight, the authors have developed a general elastodynamic model of the feeder for predicting its dynamic behavior. The model takes into account the most important parameters involved during operation: leaf spring stiffness, base and bowl inertia, forces due to the electromagnets, damping effects and dynamic stiffness of the base mounts. All these parameters have been also experimentally evaluated on a real feeder used in automatic assembly lines by pharmaceutical companies. Globally, the proposed model is a lumped-parameter model with three degrees of freedom. The proposed model has been validated by using two methodologies: the experimental modal analysis, and the operational vibration measurements. The results of these validations show that the model can be used both to analyze the dynamic behavior of the feeder, and {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} parameter changes during design...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} (AE) {{technology is}} a promising approach to non-intrusively measure the size distribution of particles in a pneumatic suspension. This paper presents an experimental study of the AE sensing technology coupled with signal processing algorithms for on-line particle sizing. The frequency characteristics of the AE signals under different experimental conditions are studied and compared. Initially, {{the characteristics of the}} background noise and AE signals are compared in the frequency domain for different air velocities and particle feeding rates. Through short-term energy analysis the working features of the suction unit and the <b>vibration</b> <b>feeder</b> are revealed. To find the effective characteristic frequency band of the AE signals, a multiple scanning and accumulation method assisted with a Savitzky–Golay smoothing filter is used to denoise the power spectra of the signals. Wavelet analysis is also deployed to denoise the signals. The denoising performance of different wavelet parameters (wavelet function, decomposition level and thresholding) is compared in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and signal smoothness. Finally, particle size is predicted through a neural network with energy fraction extracted through wavelet analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the relative error of the particle sizing system is no greater than 23 %...|$|E
