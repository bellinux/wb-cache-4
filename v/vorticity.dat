5|$|This basin’s {{season has}} a double peak: one in April and May, before {{the onset of}} the monsoon, and another in October and November, just after. This double peak occurs because {{powerful}} vertical wind shear in between the surface monsoonal low and upper tropospheric high during the monsoon season tears apart incipient cyclones. High shear explains why no cyclones can form in the Red Sea, which possesses the necessary depth, <b>vorticity</b> and surface temperatures year-round.

5|$|On March25, 2014, a {{weak area}} of low {{pressure}} accompanied by broad, flaring convection became increasingly organized over Mozambique. Owing to favorable environmental conditions, featuring low wind shear, <b>vorticity</b> became more enhanced and symmetrical. A compact system, the low steadily organized as it emerged over the Mozambique Channel on March26. Though continued land interaction initially hindered development, enhanced outflow supported convective development as it straddled the Mozambique–Tanzania border. With high sea surface {{temperatures in the}} storm's track, the JTWC anticipated further organization and issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 2000UTC on March26. Once further offshore on March27, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center Météo-France in La Réunion classified the system as Disturbance 14. Drifting slowly east, a prominent feeder band developed along the system's eastern side; however, this band disrupted low-level inflow of warm, moist air and suppressed convection over the circulation center.|$|E
5|$|On October11, 2015, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather traversed Central America {{and emerged}} over the eastern Pacific Ocean. The disturbance moved slowly {{over the next few}} days, and coalesced into a Central American gyre—a broad monsoonal circulation. A tropical wave crossed the Caribbean Sea and eventually reached Central America on October15; the two systems merged the following day near the Gulf of Tehuantepec. A concurrent Tehuantepec gap wind event on the western side of the gyre, complimented by anticyclonic flow behind a cold front, enhanced <b>vorticity</b> and spurred the formation of an elongated area of low pressure on October17. The broad system spanned several hundred miles from the Yucatán Peninsula into the eastern Pacific. A large, disorganized area of convection—showers and thunderstorms—accompanied the system, increasing in coverage substantially throughout the day. A strong pulse in the Madden–Julian oscillation—a propagating climate pattern associated with increased tropical cyclogenesis—may have aided in creating favorable conditions for further development.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Typhoon Amy {{can be traced}} back to a {{low-pressure}} area first detected over Kwajalein at 0500UTC on November29. Tracking westward, the Fleet Weather Center in Guam began to monitor <b>vorticity</b> for potential development, assigning the numeric designation 11122 to the tropical system. Late on December2, a routine weather reconnaissance flight unexpectedly intercepted the disturbance and detected unusually strong westerly winds, a characteristic typically indicative of a tropical cyclone. As such, the flight, named Vulture George, was rerouted to investigate the area. After finding conclusive evidence of a closed low-pressure area, the Fleet Weather Center in Guam classified the disturbance as a tropical storm with winds of 100km/h (60mph). At the time, Amy had two separate centers of circulation, resulting in an asymmetrical wind field.|$|E

5|$|Whether it be a {{depression}} in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) or monsoon trough, a broad surface front, or an outflow boundary, a low level feature with sufficient <b>vorticity</b> and convergence is required to begin tropical cyclogenesis. About 85 to 90percent of Pacific typhoons form within the monsoon trough. Even with perfect upper level conditions and the required atmospheric instability, {{the lack of a}} surface focus will prevent the development of organized convection and a surface low. Vertical wind shear of less than 10m/s (20kn, 33ft/s) between the ocean surface and the tropopause is required for tropical cyclone development. Typically with Pacific typhoons, there are two outflow jets: one to the north ahead of an upper trough in the Westerlies, and a second towards the equator.|$|E
5|$|Factors {{required}} {{for the formation of}} medicanes are somewhat different than that normally expected of tropical cyclones; known to emerge over regions with sea surface temperatures (SSTs) below , Mediterranean tropical cyclones often require incursions of colder air to induce atmospheric instability. A majority of medicanes develop above regions of the Mediterranean with SSTs of , with the upper bound only found in the southernmost reaches of the sea. Despite the low sea surface temperatures, the instability incited by cold atmospheric air within a baroclinic zone—regions with high differences in temperature and pressure—permits the formation of medicanes, in contrast to tropical areas lacking high baroclinity, where raised SSTs are needed. While significant deviations in air temperature have been noted around the time of Mediterranean tropical cyclones' formation, few anomalies in sea surface temperature coincide with their development, indicating that the formation of medicanes is primarily controlled by higher air temperatures, not by anomalous SSTs. Similar to tropical cyclones, minimal wind shear—difference in wind speed and direction over a region—as well as abundant moisture and <b>vorticity</b> encourages the genesis of tropical cyclone-like systems in the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

By means of combined analytical and numerical methods, we identify stable two-dimensional modes supported by the nonlinear system. In the absence of the Zeeman splitting, these are mixed modes, which combine zero and nonzero <b>vorticities</b> in each of the two spinor components, and vortex-antivortex complexes.
