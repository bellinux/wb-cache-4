5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>possibility</b> that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E

50|$|Nuclear {{ethics is}} a cross-disciplinary field of {{academic}} and policy-relevant study in which {{the problems associated with}} nuclear warfare, nuclear deterrence, nuclear arms control, nuclear disarmament, or nuclear energy are examined through one or more ethical or moral theories or frameworks. In contemporary security studies, the problems of nuclear warfare, deterrence, proliferation, and so forth are often understood strictly in political, strategic, or military terms. In the study of international organizations and law, however, these problems are also understood in legal terms. Nuclear ethics assumes that the <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>possibilities</b> of human extinction, mass human destruction, or mass environmental damage which could result from nuclear warfare are deep ethical or moral problems. Specifically, it assumes that the outcomes of human extinction, mass human destruction, or environmental damage count as moral evils. Another area of inquiry concerns future generations and the burden that nuclear waste and pollution imposes on them. Some scholars have concluded that it is therefore morally wrong to act in ways that produce these outcomes, which means it is morally wrong to engage in nuclear warfare.|$|R

25|$|After {{defeating}} Louis, Schmeling {{expected a}} title shot against James J. Braddock, who had unexpectedly defeated Max Baer for the heavyweight title the previous June. Madison Square Garden (MSG) had {{a contract with}} Braddock for the title defense and also sought a Braddock-Schmeling title bout. But Jacobs and Braddock's manager Joe Gould had been planning a Braddock-Louis matchup for months.

Well before the actual fight, Jacobs and Gould publicly announced that their fighters would fight for the heavyweight title on June 22, 1937.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT), the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emissions and Reflections (ASTER) radiometer, and the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) radiometer are the instruments involved. Early indications in March indicate that each of these instruments are working well and will be augmenting data bases from heritage instruments as well as producing new, unprecedented observations of land, ocean, and atmosphere features. Several missions will follow the Terra mission as the Earth Observing mission systems complete development and go into operation. These missions include EOS PM- 1 /'Aqua', Icesat, Vegetation Canopy Lidar (VCL), Jason/TOPEX Follow-on, the Chemistry mission, etc. As the Earth Observing systems completes its first phase in about 2004 a wealth of data enabling better understanding of the Earth and the management of its resources will have been provided.

40|$|Patients with non-insulin {{dependent}} {{diabetes mellitus}} and obesity show an elevated risk {{for development of}} arterial hypertension, while many non-obese, non-diabetic patients with essential hypertension display resistance to insulin-induced glucose disposal, accompanied by hyperinsulinaemia. This close association has lead some investigators to postulate that insulin resistance could be implicated in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. Among the various factors considered as potential links between insulin resistance and high blood pressure, the sympathetic nervous system {{can be considered a}} prime candidate. In particular, our recent data in hypertensive patients have documented that the muscle sympathetic response evoked by insulin is about threefold greater than that observed in normal subjects. Such finding is well in agreement with previous observations in hypertensives obtained with experimental maneuvers and extends them by showing an abnormal sympathetic response to a physiological stimulus like insulin, so important in every day life. Recent data both from our and other laboratories have clearly established that an acute activation of sympathetic nervous system is able to antagonize insulin-mediated glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle, making <b>very</b> <b>real</b> the <b>possibility</b> that a primary defect in insulin sensitivity in hypertension may be further aggravated by the greater sympathetic response evoked by episodic stimuli, such as postprandial hyperinsulinaemia.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{consists}} in developing a semantics for the notion of <b>real</b> <b>possibility.</b> <b>Real</b> <b>possibilities</b> are alternative possibilities for the future in an indeterministic world. In our investigations, we depart from the theory of branching time. The task of providing a semantics for the notion of <b>real</b> <b>possibility</b> is then twofold: there is a logical and a metaphysical challenge. From a logical point of view, the challenge consists in setting up a formal branching time semantics that makes use of parameters of truth that are suited for modeling the temporal dynamics of <b>real</b> <b>possibilities.</b> The metaphysical challenge, on the other hand, consists in providing a systematic explanation of branching time models that properly accommodates the worldly aspect of <b>real</b> <b>possibilities.</b> In chapter 1, we introduce the notion of <b>real</b> <b>possibility</b> and the theory of branching time and point out {{the adequacy of the}} branching time framework for the formal representation of <b>real</b> <b>possibilities.</b> We discuss the peculiarities of <b>real</b> <b>possibilities</b> and locate the notion of <b>real</b> <b>possibility</b> in the vast landscape of possibilities. We then provide the definition of a branching time structure and go over the two most popular semantic approaches based on the framework of branching time, viz. Peirceanism and Ockhamism. Finally, we motivate our choice of the branching time framework over the popular possible worlds framework by highlighting crucial differences between the two frameworks. In chapter 2, we present a novel propositional semantics based on the framework of branching time, viz. the so-called transition semantics. The basic idea is to replace the moment-history pairs employed as parameters of truth in the Ockhamist semantics by pairs consisting of a moment and a set of transitions, where every transition selects one of the immediate future possibilities open at a moment. The transition semantics exploits the structural resources a branching time structure has to offer and provides a fine-grained picture of the interrelation of modality and time. We show that both Peirceanism and Ockhamism can be viewed as limiting cases of the transition approach that build on restricted resources only. In chapter 3, we make a significant step toward a future completeness result for the transition framework. We first show that sets of transitions correspond one-to-one to certain substructures of branching time structures. On the basis of that result, we then provide a general characterization of a class of genuine Kripke structures that is shown to preserve validity. In chapter 4, we present a dynamic, modal explanation of branching time models for <b>real</b> <b>possibility</b> in terms of potentialities. The core idea is this: by manifesting their potentialities, objects become causally efficacious and jointly give direction to the possible future courses of events. We provide a rigorous formal characterization of potentialities, whose manifestations are construed as transitions toward the future, and show how a branching time model for <b>real</b> <b>possibility</b> together with its underlying structure can be lifted in a dynamic fashion from a single momentary circumstance {{on the basis of the}} potentialities of objects...|$|R
40|$|The 1980 s were {{ushered in}} {{under a cloud}} of {{uncertainty}} in the world energy picture. During {{the decade of the}} 80 s, phenomenal developments occurred in energy that are certain to influence the energy situation in the 1990 s. Perhaps {{the most important of these}} developments was energy conservation, both mandated and voluntary. Other factors were the development of additional energy reserves, nuclear energy becoming more and more unpopular, and acid rain becoming a critical environmental concern. How will these developments affect energy in the 1990 s? Already some energy conservation efforts are being relaxed. With neither nuclear energy nor high-sulfur coal, more emphasis will have to be placed on gas, oil, and low-sulfur coal. The U. S. is still highly dependent upon imported oil, making the supply vulnerable to the whims of foreign governments. These factors coupled with the fact that energy demand is likely to increase substantially during the next few years make <b>very</b> <b>real</b> the <b>possibility</b> of an energy shortage and escalating energy prices in the 1990 s. Meanwhile, agriculture has entered a new era of Conservation farming that potentially could have a revolutionary effect in the 1990 s.

Fortunately, many of the same practices that conserve soil, water, fossil fuels, labor, and money are effective LISA practices. Reducing production inputs, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and tillage, reduces production costs and conserves energy.

A number of biologic, environmental, social and economic indicators have been defined, and after initial configuration only a few daily recordings are needed to enable the generation of a “Sustainability Certificate”, highlighting degree of sustainability for the batch / trip in question in all these areas, including a rough estimate of carbon footprint. WhiteFishMaLL is the consumer-oriented follow-up to WhiteFish where, after conducting detailed interviews and getting feedback from focus groups, consumers indicated what sustainability-related information they are most interested in, and how they prefer to get access to it. Based on this, batch-specific QR-codes with link to extended product information (including sustainability information) were developed and deployed in cod and haddock supply chains, enabling environmentally conscious consumers in UK fish&chip shops to scan the code and get access to previously unavailable product information.

It is evident that the trial judge erred in the case of W.D., making error in recharge as to the standard of proof required of the Crown. The Court examined whether the error was reversible in light of the correct instructions that had been given to the jury minutes prior to the recharge during the main charge. In other words, the trial judge's error of putting such an either/or proposition to the jury causes the exclusion of a third alternative: that the jury, without believing the accused, after considering the accused's evidence in the context of the evidence as a whole, may still have reasonable doubt as to his guilt.|$|R
