40|$|Sulphur-containing {{compounds}} in wine have been extensively studied {{because of their}} effect on wine flavour and quality. In this study, an enzyme that degrades sulphur-containing amino acids was cloned and characterised from two Oenococcus oeni strains of oenological origins. The enzyme has features of a cystathionine-γ-lyase (EC 4. 4. 1. 1), a pyridoxal- 5 -phosphate-dependent enzyme catalysing an α,γ-elimination reaction of l-cystathionine to produce l-cysteine, α-ketobutyrate and ammonia. Moreover, {{it was able to}} catalyse an α,β-elimination reaction producing homocysteine, pyruvate and ammonia from l-cystathionine. An elimination reaction of l-cysteine and dl-homocysteine was also efficiently catalysed by the enzyme, resulting in the formation of hydrogen sulphide. Furthermore, the ability to demethiolate methionine into methanethiol, an unfavourable <b>volatile</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compound</b> in terms of wine aroma, was observed. The findings of this work suggest that O. oeni seems to play a minor role in the production of volatile sulphur compounds during the vinification process as the optimal conditions were far from the harsh wine environment. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

After a period of 42 hr about 60 - 80 % of total methionine sulphur added was released as methanethiol. Addition of chloramphenicol did not alter the induction period nor the maximum emission rate of methanethiol in response to L-methionine. Emission was also observed in response to S-methyl-L-cysteine; however, the shorter lag-period for methanethiol formation occured in response to L-methionine. Feeding experiments with L-(S(35 -isotope)) methionine to leaf discs showed that more than 80 % of methanethiol emitted was derived from the labelled methionine fed. These findings suggest that plants have the capacity to degrade L-methionine to methanethiol. Whole leaves fed L-methionine by the petiole systems do not emit methanethiol, but this compound is formed and transported into the feeding solution.

Methods: PubMed-MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane-CENTRAL were searched to identify potentially relevant studies. The inclusion criteria included the following: randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) conducted in humans in good general health (no systemic disorders) and a patient age of 17 years. For the intervention, we considered tongue cleaning [the use of a tongue scraper (TS) or tongue brush (TB) ] and for the control, brushing only (B) groups. Clinical parameters such as <b>volatile</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compound</b> concentration, organoleptic scores and TC were the outcome variables of interest.

40|$|Seawater {{concentrations}} of the climate-cooling, <b>volatile</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compound</b> dimethylsulphide (DMS) {{are the result}} of numerous production and consumption processes within the marine ecosystem. Due to this complex nature, it is difficult to predict temporal and geographical distribution patterns of DMS concentrations and the inclusion of DMS into global ocean climate models has only been attempted recently. Comparisons between individual model predictions, and ground-truthing exercises revealed that information on the functional relationships between physical and chemical ecosystem parameters, biological productivity and the production and consumption of DMS and its precursor dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) is necessary to further refine future climate models. In this review an attempt is made to quantify these functional relationships. The description of processes includes: (1) parameters controlling DMSP production such as species composition and abiotic factors; (2) the conversion of DMSP to DMS by algal and bacterial enzymes; (3) the fate of DMSP-sulphur due to, e. g., grazing, microbial consumption and sedimentation and (4) factors controlling DMS removal from the water column such as microbial consumption, photo-oxidation and emission to the atmosphere. We recommend the differentiation of six phytoplankton groups for inclusion in future models: eukaryotic and prokaryotic picoplankton, diatoms, dinoflagellates, and other phytoflagellates with and without DMSP-lyase activity. These functional groups are characterised by their cell size, DMSP content, DMSP-lyase activity and interactions with herbivorous grazers. In this review, emphasis is given to ecosystems dominated by the globally relevant haptophytes Emiliania huxleyi and Phaeocystis sp., which are important DMS and DMSP producers. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective Halitosis can {{be caused}} by {{microorganisms}} that produce volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs), which colonize the surface of the tongue and subgingival sites. Studies have reported that the use of natural products can reduce the bacterial load and, consequently, the development of halitosis. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Melaleuca alternifolia on the growth and <b>volatile</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compound</b> (VSC) production of oral bacteria compared with chlorhexidine. Material and Methods The effects of these substances were evaluated by the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) in planktonic cultures of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas endodontalis. In addition, gas chromatography analyses were performed to measure the concentration of VSCs from bacterial cultures and to characterize M. alternifolia oil components. Results The MIC and MBC values were as follows: M. alternifolia - P. gingivalis (MIC and MBC= 0. 007 %), P. endodontalis (MIC and MBC= 0. 007 %= 0. 5 %); chlorhexidine - P. gingivalis and P. endodontalis (MIC and MBC= 1. 5 mg/mL). M. alternifolia significantly reduced the growth and production of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) by P. gingivalis (p< 0. 05, ANOVA-Dunnet) and the H 2 S and methyl mercaptan (CH 3 SH) levels of P. endodontalis (p< 0. 05, ANOVA-Dunnet). Chlorhexidine reduced the growth of both microorganisms without altering the production of VSC in P. endodontalis. For P. gingivalis, the production of H 2 S and CH 3 SH decreased (p< 0. 05, ANOVA-Dunnet).

Thirty-four subjects with confirmed intra-oral halitosis were randomized into a double-blind, controlled, cross-over study to one of 2 groups; (i) CB 12 -water-water or (ii) water-CB 12 -CB 12. Each group comprised 3 treatments, each given evening and morning (12 [*]h apart) on consecutive study days, with a 5 d washout between treatments. Intra-oral halitosis was assessed objectively by measuring concentrations of hydrogen sulphide, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl sulphide and total <b>volatile</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compound</b> (VSC) concentrations and subjectively using organoleptic score (OLS). These were measured at baseline, 12 [*]h after the evening rinse (i. e. 12 [*]h overnight assessment) and 12 [*]h after the daytime rinse (i. e. 12 [*]h day time assessment).

In the last two decades, there has been an increasing interest in the role of the marine cryosphere in the DMS,P cycle, motivated by repeated observations of very high DMS,P concentrations in sea ice. However, our understanding of the factors driving the spatiotemporal variations of these high concentrations, and hence the fate of the sea ice DMS pool, remains limited. To date, studies have essentially focused on biotic factors, attributing the high DMS,P concentrations to the high biomass of the sympagic communities, and to their strong physiological response to the low temperature and high salinity stresses of the brine habitat. We present here an approach integrating both biotic and abiotic factors, as we investigate the influence of sea ice growth processes and brine dynamics on the DMS,P cycle. We focus on a fast ice site (Cape Evans, McMurdo Sound, Antarctica) under the influence of ice-shelf waters, and provide measurements covering a full cycle of ice growth. We show a good correspondence between isolated maxima of DMS,P in interior ice and the occurrence of platelet crystals in the ice texture. We develop the idea that platelet ice formation in May strongly modifies the production of DMS,P by (1) favoring the incorporation of strong DMSP producers and by (2) exposing these producers to stronger environmental stresses. We then show the influence of the development and decline of a strong diatom bloom from October to November on bottom ice DMS,P concentrations. Finally, we show that the increase in brine volume fraction (permeability) on warming in early December triggers (1) an important release of DMS to the ocean through brine convection, and (2) a vertical redistribution of DMSP across the ice...|$|E
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} garlic (Allium sativum L.) {{has been known}} since ancient times. The first citation {{dates back to the}} Egyptian period of 15 th century B. C. when garlic was reported to be used in folk medicine as a remedy for microbial infections. Scientific investigations on garlic started in 1858 with the work of Pasteur who first noted antibacterial properties of garlic extracts. From that date to the discovery of antibiotics, garlic has been used against amoebic dysentery and epidemic diseases such as typhus, cholera, diphtheria, and tuberculosis. But what makes garlic and Allium species effective against pathogenic microbes? The <b>volatile</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compound</b> allicin and other thiosulfinates, giving pungency to Allium plants, are well-studied and are the main element responsible for garlic activity against microbes. The thiosulfinates or alkane(ene) thial-S-oxide are formed by the action of the enzyme alliinase (EC 4. 4. 1. 4) from their respective S-alk(en) yl cysteine sulfoxides when the bulbs are cut. However, depending on the Allium species, and under differing conditions, thiosulfinates can decompose to form additional sulfur constituents, including diallyl, methyl allyl, and dipropyl mono-, di-, tri- e tetra-sulfides, and (E) - and (Z) -ajoene without losing antimicrobial activity. Besides these apolar compounds, onion and garlic are characterized by more polar compounds of steroidal and phenolic origin, often glycosilated, showing also interesting antimicrobial activity. These latter compounds, compared to the more studied thiosulfinates, have the advantages of not being pungent an are more stable during cooking. Recently, there has been increasing scientific attention given to such compounds. Compounds possessing nitrogen atoms, like alkaloids and polypeptides, have also been isolated from these plants and have shown antimicrobial activity.

[...] 207 pagesMarine aerosols {{have a large}} {{potential to}} influence the Earth’s climate through their effects on cloud properties. The CLAW hypothesis goes further, and suggests that marine aerosols formed by the sulphur cycle {{of the ocean and}} the atmosphere act as a mechanism for regulating the Earth's climate. This effect is produced through the influence of plankton emissions of sulphur compounds on cloud formation. Phytoplankton produces dimethylsulphide (DMS), a highly <b>volatile</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compound.</b> Once in the atmosphere, DMS is oxidized and becomes the main source of natural atmospheric sulphates. These sulphates act as condensation nuclei, particles that are essential for the formation of clouds. Those marine particles in the atmosphere {{play an important role in}} the Earth's radiation budget. Indirectly they produce a greater amount of cloud droplets. Higher cloud condensation nuclei imply smaller cloud droplets. The efficiency of smaller droplets in reflecting incident solar radiation is greater, resulting in an increase in cloud albedo, producing a cooling effect on the Earth's surface. To properly study the marine aerosols we need accurate knowledge of the global seawater distribution of the aerosol precursors. Our work focused on the ocean-to-atmosphere emissions of DMS and other biogenic gases that can have an impact on cloud microphysics. During the thesis we updated the monthly global DMS climatology taking advantage of the three-fold increased size and better resolved distribution of the observations available in the DMS database. The emerging patterns found with the previous versions of the database and climatology were explored with the updated version. The statistical relationships between the seasonalities of DMS concentrations and solar radiation doses and chlorophyll a concentrations were here re-examined. Analyses of nine years of satellite data suggested that there is a natural inverse correlation between the spatial cover of low marine clouds and the cloud droplet size, which is related to the presence of small aerosols. This coupled seasonality pushes cloud albedo to contribute higher negative radiative forcing in summer and lower in winter. This relation is disrupted in the marine atmosphere regions heavily impacted by anthropogenic aerosols. Consequently, the potential influence the aerosol precursors have on marine clouds was next analysed over unpolluted and polluted ocean, separately. The 9 years of global satellite data and ocean climatologies were used to derive parameterizations of the production fluxes of secondary aerosols formed by oxidation of DMS and other biogenic organic volatiles. Further, the emission fluxes of biogenic primary organic and sea salt aerosols ejected by wind action on sea surface were also globally studied. Series of weekly estimates of these fluxes were correlated to series of cloud droplet effective radius. The outcome of the statistical analyses indicated that sulphur and organic secondary aerosols might be important in seeding cloud nucleation and droplet activation over mid and high latitude unpolluted oceanic regions. Conversely, primary aerosols (organic and sea salt) showed that, despite contributing to large shares of the marine aerosol mass, they do not seem to be major drivers of the variability of cloud microphysics. Our results provide partial support for the feasibility of the CLAW hypothesis at the seasonal scale. Despite that DMS has drawn much of the attention on the links between marine biota and climate regulation, the implication of other biogenic precursors on cloud formation provides and suggests a wider scope on the formulation of such hypothesisPeer Reviewe...|$|E

In most cases, oral malodour originates {{as the result of}} microbial metabolism and degradation of proteins, especially those that contain cysteine and methionine, or peptides and aminoacids that are present in the salivary/gingival crevicular fluid or in food that is retained on the teeth. It has been previously reported that VSCs, such as hydrogen sulphide (which accounts for 80 % of oral VSCs), methyl mercaptan, dimethyl sulphide and allyl mercaptan, are the major gases associated with unpleasant oral malodour [6, 7].|$|R
50|$|A {{substantial}} amount of defective drywall was imported into the United States from China and incorporated into {{tens of thousands of}} homes during rebuilding in 2006 and 2007 following Hurricane Katrina and in other places. Complaints included foul odour, health effects, and corrosion of metal within the structure. This is caused by the emission of sulphurous gases. The same drywall was sold in Asia without problems resulting, but U.S. homes are built much more tightly than homes in China, with less ventilation. <b>Volatile</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds,</b> including hydrogen sulphide, have been detected as emissions from the imported drywall and may be linked to health problems. These compounds are emitted from many different types of drywall.|$|R
40|$|Halitosis: an {{overview}} of epidemiology, etiology and clinical management Abstract: Halitosis is an unpleasant condition that causes social re-straint. Studies worldwide indicate a high prevalence of moderate halito-sis, whereas severe cases are restricted to around 5 % of the populations. The etiological chain of halitosis relates {{to the presence of}} odoriferous substances in exhaled air, especially the <b>volatile</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> (VSC) produced by bacteria. The organoleptic diagnosis is the gold stan-dard and clinical management includes oral approaches, especially peri-odontal treatment and oral hygiene instructions, including the tongue. When oral strategies are not successful, referral to physicians is warrant-ed.

50|$|Some {{studies have}} shown that it is the {{bacteria}} on the tongue which often produce malodorous compounds and fatty acids that may account for 80% to 85% of all cases of bad breath. The remaining 15% to 20% of cases originate in the stomach, from the tonsils, from decaying food stuck between the teeth, gum disease, dental caries (cavities or tooth decay) or plaque accumulated on the teeth. In addition, degradation of oral debris by microorganisms, produce organosulfur <b>compounds</b> (<b>volatile</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds)</b> on the posterior (rear) of the tongue. These molecules account for approximately 80% to 85% of all cases of bad breath. Bad breath may cause embarrassment and can negatively affect social interactions and communication.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Cystinosis {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive disorder characterized by the intralysosomal accumulation of cystine. Cysteamine removes cystine from the lysosome and slows down the progression of the disease. One of its side effects is the induction of halitosis, which can interfere with patients' willingness to comply with cysteamine treatment. Objective: To identify breath <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> causing halitosis induced by cysteamine therapy in patients with cystinosis. Study design: After the ingestion of 15 mg/kg cysteamine whole blood (n = 4), urine (n = 4) and breath (n = 8) <b>volatile</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> levels were measured every 60 min over a 360 min period by gas chromatography and the cysteamine plasma concentrations (n = 4) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: The expired air of cystinotic patients contained elevated concentrations of methanethiol (MT, median maximum value 0. 5 (range 0 - 11) nmol/L) and, in particular, dimethylsulphide (DMS, median maximum value 15 (range 2 - 83) nmol/L). DMS concentrations higher than 0. 65 nmol/L are known to cause halitosis. Maximal plasma values of cysteamine (median 46 (range 30 - 52) mu mol/L) preceded those of NIT and DMS, confirming that cysteamine is converted to NIT and DMS. Less than 3 % {{of the amount of}} cysteamine ingested was excreted as NIT and DMS via expired air and 0. 002 % via urine. Conclusion: Halitosis induced by cysteamine intake is caused by DMS {{and to a lesser extent}} by NIT, excreted via the expired air. Further studies should focus on the possibilities of reducing the formation of these <b>volatile</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> or masking their odour, which would improve the rates of compliance with cysteamine treatment.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{physical}} and chemical properties of activated carbon (AC) on the adsorption of ethyl mercaptan, dimethyl sulphide and dimethyl disulphide was investigated by treating a commercial AC with nitric acid and ozone. The chemical properties of ACs were characterised by temperature programme desorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. AC treated with nitric acid presented a larger amount of oxygen functional groups than materials oxidised with ozone. This enrichment allowed a significant improvement on adsorption capacities for ethyl mercaptan and dimethyl sulphide but not for dimethyl disulphide. In order to gain a deeper knowledge on the effect of the surface chemistry of AC on the adsorption of <b>volatile</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds,</b> the quantum-chemical COSMO-RS method was used to simulate the interactions between AC surface groups and the studied <b>volatile</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> In agreement with experimental data, this model predicted a greater affinity of dimethyl disulphide towards AC, unaffected by the incorporation of oxygen functional groups in the surface. Moreover, the model pointed out to an increase of the adsorption capacity of AC by the incorporation of hydroxyl functional groups in the case of ethyl mercaptan and dimethyl sulphide due to the hydrogen bond interactionsR.

40|$|With {{increasing}} frequency {{over the past}} 20 years, generally {{during the second half}} of June, Dutch and German beaches were covered with a massive layer, up to 2 m thick, of the alga Phaeocystis pouchetii. Increased anthropogenic inputs of nutrients, unbalanced in favour of nitrogen and phosphorus with respect to silica, promoted these conditions and reinforced the tendency of Phaeocystis to develop temporary, explosive blooms. These blooms caused a decrease in food resources for zooplankton, and increased deposition of organic material to the bottom, accumulation of organic material (dissolved or in the form of foam), and emission of <b>volatile</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> Means of control were unclear but it was possible that the food, cosmetic, textile and pharmaceutical industries could exploit the Phaeocystis mucus.
