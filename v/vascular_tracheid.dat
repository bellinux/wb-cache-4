Tangential section shows 4 – 5 seriate rays. Height of rays is from 30 to approximately 50 cells. In radial section rays are generally homogenous. Spiral thickenings are conspicuous in vessels.|$|R
40|$|A {{hitherto}} unappreciated correlation {{exists between}} nature of vessel grouping {{and nature of}} imperforate tracheary elements in wood of dicotyledons at large: families and genera with true tracheids (large fully bordered pits common on both radial and tangential walls) have solitary vessels. Presence of true tracheids as a subsidiary conductive system is hypothesized to render vessel grouping a superfluous adaptation. Vessel grouping does occur to various degrees in taxa with fiber-tracheids or libriform fibers; the degree of grouping is related to likelihood or seriousness of vessel failure by air embolisms because of either drought or frost. Grouping of vessels {{is regarded as a}} way of providing alternate conduits whereby water can be carried in the same pathways in case one or several vessels in a group are incapacitated by air embolisms. Presence of <b>vascular</b> <b>tracheids,</b> if sufficiently abundant, is held to be correlated with smaller degree of vessel grouping because <b>vascular</b> <b>tracheids</b> can form a subsidiary conductive system; small numbers of <b>vascular</b> <b>tracheids</b> do not affect vessel grouping patterns. Species which possess vasicentric tracheids possess a subsidiary conductive system ideally located around vessels and have solitary vessels or else (ifvasicentric tracheids are less common) a low degree of vessel grouping. Species with very large vessels at the beginning of growth rings tend to have little grouping in the earlywood vessels but more grouping in latewood vessels; this dimorphism is held to relate to enhanced safety oflatewood vessels, since earlywood vessels have little safety and the latewood is thereby the wood portion where safety mechanisms are concentrated. Fiber-tracheids do not have sufficient conductive capabilities to form a subsidiary conductive system; borders on pits of fiber-tracheids are rapidly lost during evolution, and such loss generally pr~cedes appearance of septate or nucleated conditions or is simultaneous with it. Relative selective value of the various vessel grouping types (clusters, radial multiples, diagonal bands, tangential bands) as well as of larger aggregations remains a topic for more investigation, as does significance of grouping of primary xylem vessels...|$|R

They are coarse, strongly angled in the transverse section and not aligned in radial rows, thin to medium with 1.15  mm (0.90 – 1.52) length, 28.4  µm (22.6 – 35.7) width and 6.1  µm (7.8 – 4.4) wall thickness. Fibers are septate and non-septate, sometimes bifurcated. Pits are numerous, confined to the radial walls, simple to minutely bordered.

40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are presented for 44 collections representing 42 species in 27 genera. Lamiaceae basically have: vessels with simple perforation plates; vessel-to-vessel pitting alternate; imperforate tracheary elements all libriform fibers, fibers commonly septate; axial parenchyma scanty vasicentric; rays Heterogeneous Type IIB. These features ally Lamiaceae closely with Verbenaceae. In {{addition to the}} Mesomorphy ratio (based on vessel element dimensions), features that indicate wood xeromorphy in Lamiaceae, in probable increasing order of importance are: presence of indistinct to marked growth rings; presence of helical thickenings in vessels; presence of vasicentric or vascular tracheids; presence of vessel groups averaging three or more vessels per group. More mesomorphic woods in Lamiaceae occur in species that are arborescent to shrubby, and that occur in areas that have no prolonged drought. Helical sculpture in vessels is expressed not only as thickenings, but also as grooves interconnecting pit apertures (coalesced pit apertures), and inconspicuous thickenings in pairs along the grooves. <b>Vascular</b> <b>tracheids</b> (at ends of growth rings) occur in several genera. Where growth rings are very narrow (Salvia, Trichostema), vessels and tracheids are intermixed, thereby justifying description as vasicentric tracheids of what may have originated phylogenetically as <b>vascular</b> <b>tracheids.</b> This may represent one pathway for origin of vasicentric tracheids. Wide bands of axial parenchyma in Cuminia and Leptosceptrum have originated {{as a result of}} fiber dimorphism. Abundance of upright cells in numerous Lamiaceae is indicative ofpaedomorphosis, and may point to secondary woodiness in some instances; the family as a whole appears ancestrally moderately woody. The ratio between libriform fiber length and vessel element length marks Lamiaceae as specialized. Crystal presence and cambial variants are newly reported for the family...|$|R
40|$|The {{secondary}} xylem of Elaeagnus, Hippophae. and Shepherdia is described and illustrated in detail. Shrubs and small trees of Elaeaguaceae have ring-porous or semi-ring-porous wood with simple perforation plates, <b>vascular</b> <b>tracheids,</b> fiber-tracheids, diffuse or rarely paratracheal axial parenchyma, and uni- or biseriate rays in Hippophae and Shepherdia, but wider rays in Elaeagnus. Walls of vessel elements, especially narrow ones, tracheids, or fiber-tracheids sometimes show helical thickenings; {{in a few}} instances these intergrade with small bud-like protrusions associated with pits. Scanning electron microscopy illustrates that small to vestigial vestures are present in all species studied, although nonvestured pits are also common. The analogous nature of vestures and helical thickenings is considered. Comparative wood anatomy suggests a rather isolated position of the family Elaeagnaceae; affinities with Rhamnaceae, Proteaceae, and Thymelaeaceae are discussed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Vasicentric tracheids {{are defined}} as tracheids present {{adjacent}} to vessels in a wood which also possesses libriform fibers or fiber-tracheids as imperforate tracheary elements. Vasculartracheids would correspond with this definition, but {{are defined as}} occurring only in latewood, whereas vasicentric tracheids occur throughout a growth ring or in wood of a diffuse-porous species. V asicentric tracheids offer a subsidiary conducting system which can supply stems and leaves when the vessels to which vasicentric tracheids are adjacent fail because of air embolisms. True tracheids (present as the sole imperforate tracheary element type in the woods in which they occur) have much the same physiological effect, maximizing potential safety in conduction. Vasicentric <b>tracheids,</b> <b>vascular</b> <b>tracheids,</b> and true tracheids are alike in being imperforate tracheary elements bearing relatively large bordered pits approximately like those on lateral walls of vessels in density. Libriform fibers or fiber-tracheids also occur in woods in which vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> or <b>vascular</b> <b>tracheids</b> are present. <b>Vascular</b> <b>tracheids,</b> by virtue of occurrence {{only at the end}} of a growth ring (where they grade into narrow vessel elements), maintain water columns in stems, which thereby persist through dry seasons, but may not adequately supply leaves, which may wilt as drought progresses. Vasicentric tracheids, by safeguarding the conduction of all parts of a growth ring, seem related to the evergreen habit which many shrubs possessing vasicentric tracheids have. Phylads with true tracheids are relatively few in dicotyledons, and only a small part ofthese groups have evidently succeeded in adapting to dry climates. The numerous phylads which instead have libriform fibers or fiber-tracheids have developed comparable safety by evolving vasicentric tracheids. Therefore genera with vasicentric tracheids bulk large in the floras of areas in which evergreen drought-tolerant shrubs are adaptive, the Mediterranean-type areas of the world. In southern California, 26 families (17 reported for the first time) have vasicentric tracheids; notable genera include Arctostaphylos, Ceanothus, Prunus, Quercus, and Salvia. Desert shrubs have vasicentric tracheids to a somewhat lesser degree. Other Mediterranean-type areas are surveyed for both vasicentric tracheids and true tracheids. The regions so analyzed are central Chile, southern Australia, the lands adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea, and southern Mrica. Genera in these areas with vasicentric tracheids include Banksia, Carissa, Eucalyptus, Grevillea, Hakea, Protea, Quercus, Rosmarinus, etc. New Zealand and Japan are wetter and have fewer genera with vasicentric tracheids but more with true tracheids. Many drought-tolerant evergreen shrubs have vasicentric tracheids. A new listing of families and genera with vasicentric tracheids is provided for the world flora, with new reports documented and pertinent literature cited. This new listing includes 68 families (33 newly reported in this paper), which represents a considerable advance on the 32 families listed by Metcalfe and Chalk in their compendia of 1950 and 1983, and includes some large and diverse families for the first time (e. g., Ericaceae, Pittosporaceae, Rosaceae). The lack of reports on occurrence of vasicentric tracheids may in part relate to difficulty in identifying these cells; suggestions for analysis are given...|$|R
40|$|Subfamily Spathelioideae of Rutaceae {{constitutes}} a well-supported early branching clade of eight small woody genera that were formerly assigned to five different Sapindalean/Rutalean families. This study brings together detailed wood anatomical information on all eight genera (for four the wood anatomy is described {{for the first}} time in detail). Wood anatomy strongly supports the inclusion of all Spathelioid genera in Rutaceae and underpins the molecular phylogeny with a set of interesting apomorphies at different nodes of the cladogram. The wood anatomy of Cneorum tricoccon with its semi-ring porosity, dendritic vessel pattern, <b>vascular</b> <b>tracheids</b> and helical vessel wall thickenings stands out in Spathelioideae. This wood anatomical syndrome is hypothesized to be due to adaptive evolution for hydraulic safety and efficiency of this species in a typical Mediterranean climate, where similar syndromes have evolved in many unrelated clades of woody dicots. In at least six unrelated genera of Rutaceae outside Spathelioideae from Mediterranean or cool temperate and montane climates, the syndrome has also evolved in presumably parallel, adaptive evolution...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of intervascular pit membranes with a torus {{was investigated in}} juvenile wood samples of 19 species of Ulmus and seven related genera. • A staining solution of safranin and alcian blue (35 : 65) was recommended to distinguish torus-bearing pit membranes using light microscopy. • Intervascular pit membranes connecting relatively wide vessel elements resembled those of most angiosperms, as they were of uniform thickness. By contrast, bordered pit pairs with round to oval pit apertures and indistinct pit canals that connected narrow (incomplete) vessel elements or <b>vascular</b> <b>tracheids</b> with distinct helical thickenings were frequently characterized by a torus in ring-porous wood samples of Ulmus and Zelkova. Tori were lacking in diffuse-porous species of Ampelocera, Aphananthe, Gironniera, Holoptelea, Phyllostylon, Trema and Ulmus. • Our observations suggest that tori are more common in cold temperate climates than in warm (sub) tropical environments. This may indicate that narrow tracheary elements with torus-bearing pit membranes provide an auxiliary conducting system which is of low conductivity, but offers greater resistance to freezing-induced cavitation...|$|R
40|$|Stem {{and leaf}} anatomy of Dirachma socotrana, an endemic species from Socotra, is {{described}} in detail. The diffuse porous to semi-ring-porous wood is characterized by solitary vessels and vessels in short radial multiples with a tendency for oblique/radial vessel arrangement, simple vessel perforations, <b>vascular</b> <b>tracheids,</b> nonseptate fibers with simple to minutely bordered pits mainly confined to radial walls, axial parenchyma which is scanty paratracheal and in 1 - 2 -seriate marginal bands, and mainly 1 - 2 -seriate heterocellular rays. The inner bark shows stratified fiber groups; the outer bark has flaring rays. The dorsi-ventral leaves typically have an indumentum of small, unicellular hairs, anomocytic slomata, an adaxial epidermis largely composed of periclinally divided mucilage cells. The petiole and midrib vascular bundle is typically composed of a simple are-shaped strand. Prismatic crystals are common in the wood, bark, pith, and leaf. The systematic position of the monotypic family Dirachmaceae in a newly defined Resales sensu Angiosperm Phylogeny Group was established recently {{on the basis of}} molecular data and confirmed by ovule and seed characters.

40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are presented for 23 species of Buddleja and one species each of Emorya, Nuxia, and Peltanthera. Although crystal distribution is likely a systematic feature of some species of Buddleja, other wood features relate closely to ecology. Features correlated with xeromorphy in Buddleja include strongly marked growth rings (terminating with <b>vascular</b> <b>tracheids),</b> narrower mean vessel diameter, shorter vessel elements, greater vessel density, and helical thickenings in vessels. Old World species of Buddleja cannot be differentiated from New World {{species on the}} basis of wood features. Emorya wood is like that of xeromorphic species of Buddleja. Lateral wall vessel pits of Nuxia are small (2. 5 ILm) compared to those of Buddleja (mostly 5 - 7 ILm). Peltanthera wood features can also be found in Buddleja or Nuxia; Dickison 2 ̆ 7 s transfer of Sanango from Buddlejaceae to Gesneriaceae is justified. All wood features of Buddlejaceae can be found in families of subclass Asteridae such as Acanthaceae, Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, Myoporaceae, Scrophulariaceae, and Verbenaceae. Wood anatomy of Buddlejaceae relates to species ecology and size of wood sample, and is not useful in demonstrating that Buddlejaceae are closer to any particular one of these families; such evidence must be sought in molecular data and elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|This review {{examines}} {{the roles that}} radial and axial parenchyma (RAP) plays against fungal pathogens in the secondary xylem of wood {{within the context of}} the CODIT model (Compartmentalization of Decay in Trees), a defense concept first conceived in the early 1970 s by Alex Shigo. This model, simplistic in its design, shows how a large woody perennial is highly compartmented. Anatomical divisions in place at the time of infection or damage, (physical defense) alongside the ‘active’ response by the RAP during and after wounding work together in forming boundaries that function to restrict air or decay spread. The living parenchyma cells play a critical role in all of the four walls (differing anatomical constructs) that the model comprises. To understand how living cells in each of the walls of CODIT cooperate, we must have a clear vision of their complex interconnectivity from a three-dimensional perspective, along with knowledge of the huge variation in ray parenchyma (RP) and axial parenchyma (AP) abundance and patterns. Crucial patterns for defense encompass the symplastic continuum between both RP and AP and the dead tissues, with the latter including the vessel elements, libriform fibers, and imperforate tracheary elements (i. e., vasicentric and <b>vascular</b> <b>tracheids).</b> Also, the heartwood, a chemically altered antimicrobial non-living substance that forms the core of many trees, provides an integral part of the defense system. In the heartwood, dead RAP can play an important role in defense, depending on the genetic constitution of the species. Considering the array of functions that RAP are associated with, from capacitance, through to storage, and long-distance water transport, deciding how their role in defense fits into this suite of functions is a challenge for plant scientists, and likely depends on a range of factors. Here, we explore the important role of RAP in defense against fungal pathogens and the trade-offs involved from a viewpoint for structure-function relations, while also examining how fungi can breach the defense system using an array of enzymes in conjunction with the physically intrusive hyphae...|$|R

40|$|Types of xylem {{histology}} in vines, {{rather than}} types of cambial activity and xylem conformation, form {{the focus of}} this survey. Scandent plants are high in conductive capability, but therefore have highly vulnerable hydrosystems; this survey attempts to see what kinds of adaptations exist for safety and in which taxa. A review of scandent dicotyledons reveals that a high proportion possesses vasicentric tracheids (22 families) or true tracheids (24 families); the majority of scandent families falls in these categories. Other features for which listings are given include <b>vascular</b> <b>tracheids,</b> fibriform vessel elements, helical sculpture in vessels, starch-rich parenchyma adjacent to vessels, and other parenchyma distributions. The high vulnerability of wide vessels is held to be countered by various mechanisms. True tracheids and vasicentric tracheids potentially safeguard the hydrosystem by serving when large vessels are embolized. Many vines and lianas have many narrow vessel elements (often fibriform vessel elements) in addition to wide vessel elements. The narrow vessel elements are held to increase safety. In comparing scandent with nonscandent genera within a family, one finds in some cases that tracheids occur in the scandent species, whereas fiber-tracheids or libriform fibers occur in the nonscandent ones. The same is true of vasicentric tracheids in vining species as compared to nonvining relatives; vasicentric tracheids are so abundant in some families (Passifloraceae) that libriform fibers have been lost partially or wholly. New familial records for presence of vasicentric tracheids include Cucurbitaceae and Polygonaceae, and new generic records include Antigonon, Lycopersicon, and Mandevilla. Various xylem features suggest presence of auxiliary conductive capabilities when main vessels fail. Parenchyma distributions in vines, especially those in which parenchyma surrounds fiber-sheathed vessels, may offer mechanical flexibility in vines, just as presence of wide rays does. However, starch-rich axial parenchyma adjacent to vessels may provide not merely a means of storing to facilitate growth events but, additionally, a way in which hydrolysis of starch could result in movement of sugar into vessels, permitting osmotic entry of water into given areas. Adaptations which seem to lend safety to the hydrosystem are much less in vines and lianas of perpetually moist tropical regions than they are in taxa subject to periods of drought or frost...|$|R
40|$|This book is {{designed}} as a practical guide for the identification of fossil and extant woods {{with the aid of}} a marginally perforated card key, based on the ones devised by Clarke and perfected in the well-known Hardwood and Softwood keys published by the Princes Risborough Laboratory in 1961 and 1948 (1966) respectively. Using the cards originally prepared for Metcalfe and Chalk’s Anatomy of the Dicotyledons, the Princes Risborough cards, and numerous additions to these sets, the authors have gained considerable experience with this time-honoured identification method. A microfiche of these cards can be purchased separately from the Botanical Museum of Harvard University. Besides general chapters and appendices on for instance wood structure and variability, and how to prepare wood for microscopic examination and how to use the key cards, the main body of the book consists of a richly illustrated catalogue of diagnostic characters to be used in wood identification. It is in this section that the book shows most of its weaknesses. This is because of numerous mistakes in the choice of illustrations or misleading legends to the latter. For instance: fig. 3 c (p. 24) is said to show abrupt latewood in Larix laricina, but the earlywood-latewood transition zone is not included in the photomicrograph; on p. 68 the vessels of Nyssa are said to be predominantly in multiples of four or more but the photograph illustrates vessel pairs alternating with fibres (i. e., vessel multiples in a distinct radial pattern; the latter feature is illustrated on p. 69 with examples showing no sign of such a pattern at all!); the tangential vessel arrangement of fig. 4 b, p. 70 is in fact oblique; Myrica is incorrectly credited with ephedroid perforations on p. 73; Sphenostemon pictured with the most beautiful example of scalariform intervessel pits is said to show spiral thickenings instead (p. 74); long and slender pit canals are mistaken for plasmodesmata on p. 83; essentially similar fibre-tracheids in Eucryphia are classified as belonging to two fibre types (p. 87); fibres of Sleumerodendron are mistaken for <b>vascular</b> <b>tracheids</b> and crystals in the Dicotyledons are illustrated with an example from Gnetum (p. 124).

40|$|Early Cretaceous amber resins with {{macroscopic}} inclusions {{are extremely}} rare, as are ambers with inclusions from the parent plant. Here, we report earliest Cretaceous amber resins found within alluvial soils of the Ashdown Formation near Hastings in Sussex. In contrast to younger Cretaceous examples, this Hastings amber was arguably deposited {{shortly before the}} emergence of the earliest flowering plant communities c. 140 Ma BP. Preliminary studies reveal plentiful organic inclusions, including <b>vascular</b> tissues, <b>tracheid</b> cells and putative resin ducts of the parent coniferous trees. We also report remarkably preserved soil microbes, including structures comparable with actinobacterial colonies, putative fungal or cyanobacterial filaments, and the earliest examples of spider silk webs. The last includes threads that are twisted, paired and coated with sticky fluid droplets, comparable with those of araneoid spider webs studied by us in modern cherry tree resins. Together, these Hastings amber inclusions became entombed within resins that seeped through the charred bark of coniferous trees subjected to severe fire damage, whose logs were then swept onto fluvial wetlands by floods. Embalming resins of this kind may have evolved to combat damage associated with insects, fungi and widespread forest fires. © 2009 Geological Society of London...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown a {{transition}} from a primarily xylem to a primarily phloem flow of water as fleshy fruits develop, and the current hypothesis to ex-plain this transition, particularly in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) berries, is that the <b>vascular</b> tissue (<b>tracheids)</b> become non-functional as a result of post-veraison berry growth. In most studies, pedicels have been dipped in a vial containing anapoplastic dye,whichwas takenup into the entire peripheral and axial xylem vasculature of pre-veraison, but not post-veraison berries. The pressure plate/pressure membrane apparatus that is commonly used to study soil moisture characteristics was adapted and the pre- to post-veraison change in xylem function-ality in grape berries was re-evaluated by establishing a hydrostatic (tension) gradient between the pedicel and a cut surface at the stylar end of the berry. Under the influence of this applied hydrostatic gradient, movement of the apoplastic tracer dye, basic fuchsin, was found in the pedicel and throughout the axial and peripheral xylem of the berry mesocarp. A similar movement of dye could be obtained by simply adjoining the stylar cut surface to a dry, hydrophilic wickingmaterial. Since both pre- and post-veraison berries hydrate when the pedicel is dipped in water, it is hypothesized that the absence of dye movement into the vasculature of post-veraison berries indicates not a loss of xylem function, but rather the loss of an appropriate driving force (hydrostatic gradient) in the berry apoplast. Based on this hypothe-sis, and the substantial decrease in xylem flows that occur in intact grape berries at veraison, it is suggested that there may be significant changes in the pattern of solute partitioning between the fruit symplast and apo-plast at veraison. It is further suggested that diurnal patterns in symplast/apoplast solute partitioning in grapes and other fleshy fruit, may explain the observed minimal xylem contribution to the water budgets of these fruits...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} wood data are given for 13 species of 10 genera of Portulacaceae (secondary xylem from additional species of Anacampseros and Lewisia were studied but not quantitatively analyzed). Most Portulacaceae show modifications {{that can be}} related to the succulent habit, including wide, tall rays mostly composed of thin-walled cells; total or partial substitution of axial parenchyma for libriform fibers; and modified patterns of pitting on lateral walls of vessels. Pseudoscalariform pitting is more common in Portulacaceae than in other dicotyledon families. In vessels of Anacampseros wood, wide helical bands of secondary wall materi al are present. Similar helices (but without the unusual width) occur in the wood of Lewisia and Heclorella. Woods of Portulacaceae as a whole are markedly xeromorphic with respect to vessel e lement dimensions, vessel density, and vessel grouping; wood of Lewisia and Hectorella is especi ally xeromorphic. Xeromorphism is not so pronounced in succulent dicotyledons at large. Woods of species of Portulacaceae with less marked adaptation to succulence show close resemblance to woods of Didiereaceae and woodier Cactaceae, suggesting the validity of the suborder Portulacineae, which includes these three families plus Hectorellaceae and Basellaceae. The wood of Heclorella is very similar to that of Lewisia rediviva and contains no features not also observed in Portulacaceae.

40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are presented for woods of 37 species representing 11 genera; most species included represent a maximal degree of woodiness for the family, and herbaceous groups are mostly omitted. Growth rings are absent or nearly so. Vessel elements have simple perforation plates (except for Kohleria elegans) and alternate circular or oval pits {{of various sizes}} on vessel-vessel walls (often laterally elongate, often with gaping apertures, on vessel-parenchyma and vessel-septate fiber interfaces). Grooves interconnect pit apertures in vessels of four genera. Vessels are grouped, usually in radial chains, to a moderate extent. Tyloses are present. Imperforate tracheary elements are libriform fibers or (Coronanthera) fiber tracheids with vestigial borders on pits. Septa are present in imperforate tracheary elements of most species, but in most species of Cyrtandra, septate fibers occur only near vessels. Uniseriate rays are present in some species, but in most species rays are muItiseriate only or are absent altogether. <b>Vascular</b> and vasicentric <b>tracheids</b> are absent. In Cyrtandra, wood with multiseriate rays can be demonstrated to be rayless earlier in ontogeny. Crystals are present in rays and in septate fibers of a few species. Storying is present in a few species. All features of wood reflect the mesic habitats characteristic of Gesneriaceae, but moderate degrees of xeromorphy are illustrated by species in which narrow vessels, grouped vessels, and grooves in vessel walls occur. The wood anatomy of Drymonia reflects its vining habit. Raylessness may indicate secondary woodiness in Besleria and Cyrtandra.

40|$|Wood {{anatomical}} characteristics for 21 taxa of Cassiope are reported. Qualitative features differ somewhat {{from the}} general pattern of the Ericaceae. However, considerable deviation {{is found in the}} quantitative aspects of the wood features. The stems are very slender with narrow growth rings evident in all but one species. Vessel elements are very small and usually have scalariform perforation plates with several bars. Vessels are extremely abundant in transection. Vascular rays are mostly uniseriate with a few biseriates and all are composed exclusively of erect cells. The imperforate elements are tracheids which are the only conductive elements in the late wood. Calluna-type pith is found in most of the taxa while homogeneous pith is found in two species. The recognition of these in the separate genus Harrimanella is supported. Cassiope plants are often found in moist, protected microenvironments in arctic and alpine areas of extreme cold and desiccating winds. Short growing seasons and low mean temperatures probably contribute {{in large part to the}} dwarf stature of the plants, which in turn accommodates the reduced <b>vascular</b> system. The <b>tracheids</b> provide a safe conductive system in the late wood which is less susceptible to loss of function due to air embolisms. The vessel elements with scalariform perforation plates accommodate the presumably slow conductive rates in the earlier part of the growing season. The vessel elements of Cassiope are considerably smaller than most others known to have scalariform perforation plates. The values for vulnerability, an indicator of the degree of vessel redundancy and hence safety, are much lower than any yet calculated for any group. The same is true for figures for mesomorphy, which introduces vessel element length as an independent measure of degree of xeromorphy...|$|R
