5|$|A female human {{trafficking}} <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> interviewed {{with her face}} hidden. She describes how she and other {{human trafficking}} victims in Eastern Europe were held in buildings with security cameras, where {{they were forced to}} walk naked down a runway before a group of men who watched under the guise of attending a fashion show. She then describes being auctioned off to the audience members, who she says examined her off the runway as one might examine cattle.|$|E
5|$|An assault is {{not caused}} if a {{defendant}} threatens {{to shoot the}} victim, but the <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> aware that the gun is not loaded or fake. However, {{it would be the}} actus reus of an assault if the victim wrongly believes the gun is, or may be, loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) {{tries to}} {{convince}} pediatric surgeon Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) to place {{her on her}} service, to which she agrees to. A trauma <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> brought into the emergency room, with the surgical residents all trying to impress the superior physicians, in hope that their job will be preserved, come the merger. Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) returns to full-time work quickly after her cancer treatment, showcasing an auburn wig.|$|E
25|$|All of Gacy's known murders were {{committed}} inside his Norwood Park ranch house. His <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> typically induced to his address by force or deception, {{and all but}} one of his <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> murdered by either asphyxiation or strangulation with a makeshift tourniquet; his first <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> stabbed to death. Gacy buried 26 of his victims in the crawl space of his home. Three other <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> buried elsewhere on his property, while the bodies of his last four known <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> discarded in the Des Plaines River.|$|R
25|$|Thirteen of the {{nineteen}} <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> teenagers while ten {{out of the}} nineteen <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> {{women of}} aboriginal descent.|$|R
50|$|<b>Victims</b> <b>were</b> {{taken to}} {{hospitals}} in Moscow, Naro-Fominsk, Odintsovo and Selyatino. Two <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> flown by helicopter to a Moscow hospital.|$|R
5|$|The Seventh <b>Victim</b> <b>is</b> a 1943 American horror {{film noir}} {{directed}} by Mark Robson and starring Tom Conway, Jean Brooks, Isabel Jewell, Kim Hunter, and Hugh Beaumont. Written by DeWitt Bodeen and Charles O'Neal, and produced by Val Lewton for RKO Radio Pictures, the film {{focuses on a}} young woman who stumbles on an underground cult of devil worshippers in Greenwich Village, New York City, while searching for her missing sister. It marks Robson's directorial debut and was Hunter's first onscreen role.|$|E
5|$|The sole player {{character}} is Antoinette Marceau, {{an employee of}} the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits. She is aided throughout her investigation by famous detective Hercule Poirot, as well as his friend Dr. Constantine. 10 of the 13 murder suspects from Christie's novel are included in the game adaption. These are Count and Countess Andrenyi, Colonel Arbuthnot, Mary Debenham, Princess Dragomiroff, Greta Ohlsson, Antonio Foscarelli, Cyrus Hardman, Caroline Hubbard, Hector McQueen, and several staff on the Orient Express. The <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> Samuel Ratchett. In total, there are twenty characters featured in the game.|$|E
5|$|Alternate {{theories}} of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to {{theories of}} just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume {{that the world is}} free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 30,146 {{identified}} and presumed <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> {{registered in the}} 28 EU Member States in 2010-2012, out of which over a thousand were children trafficked for sexual exploitation. 80 percent of registered <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> female, and 65 percent of registered <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> EU citizens. Of the registered <b>victims</b> who <b>are</b> confirmed as EU citizens, the top 5 countries of citizenship are Bulgaria, Romania, the Netherlands, Hungary and Poland. Over the three years, the top 5 non-EU countries of citizenship of registered <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> Nigeria, Brazil, China, Viet Nam and Russia. There {{has been an increase}} in the number of ¨unknown¨ citizenships from 2010 to 2011. In addition, 71 percent of labor exploitation <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> male in the EU Member States during these three years.|$|R
50|$|Most of the <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> over 60 years old, {{though one}} <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> a 16-year-old boy. Thirteen {{of those killed}} were women and five <b>were</b> men; all <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> either from Yambol or the nearby villages. More than 15 people were injured; four were {{initially}} in a life-threatening condition due to head trauma.|$|R
50|$|Seven <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> {{treated at}} the scene. Three <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> wounded by gunfire, {{including}} two TSA officers, identified as 54-year-old James Speer and 36-year-old Tony Grigsby; Grigsby {{was shot in}} the foot. The third shooting <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> 29-year-old Brian Ludmer, a schoolteacher from Lake Forest, Illinois, who {{was shot in the}} leg. Six <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> transported to area hospitals, including three men, two of whom had suffered gunshot wounds, who were treated at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Some of the injuries were confirmed to have been caused by other factors, not gunshot wounds.|$|R
5|$|Payment is {{virtually}} always the goal, and the <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> coerced into {{paying for the}} ransomware to be removed—which {{may or may not}} actually occur—either by supplying a program that can decrypt the files, or by sending an unlock code that undoes the payload's changes. A key element in making ransomware work for the attacker is a convenient payment system that is hard to trace. A range of such payment methods have been used, including wire transfers, premium-rate text messages, pre-paid voucher services such as Paysafecard, and the digital currency Bitcoin. A 2016 survey commissioned by Citrix claimed that larger businesses are holding bitcoin as contingency plans.|$|E
5|$|The day of filming in the salvage yard, {{which took}} place at LA Japanese Auto Parts in Sun Valley, California, was {{abnormally}} hot according to Lauren Vélez. The Airstream trailer in which Dexter's <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> found was brought into the salvage yard for filming externally, but was assembled on a studio sound stage for shooting scenes inside the trailer. Erik King remarked that the trailer was dirty, odorous and humid—"all the things we needed it to be". Other filming locations included a waterfront house on Hibiscus Island in Biscayne Bay, Florida as the Castillos' home, an empty field next to Sun Valley's Tujunga Wash where a young Debra practices shooting with Harry's pistol, and {{a house in a}} residential neighborhood of Long Beach, California which stands in for Dexter's childhood home.|$|E
5|$|Using Mulder's credentials, Roche kidnaps {{a girl in}} Swampscott, Massachusetts whom he met on {{his flight}} with Mulder to Boston. Scully and Skinner arrive {{the next day and}} the agents head to the site of Roche's old {{apartment}} in Revere. They find him with the girl in an abandoned bus nearby. Roche holds the gun on the girl and tells Mulder that he'll never know for sure whether the last <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> Samantha or not if he kills him. Mulder is then forced to shoot Roche, as he starts to pull on the trigger of the stolen gun. In his office Mulder stares at the final cloth heart and puts it away, unsure of whether it belonged to Samantha or not.|$|E
50|$|The {{bodies of}} the <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> taken to the Hamilton County Coroner's Office in Cincinnati, where autopsies found that {{all but one of}} the <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> shot {{multiple}} times.|$|R
2500|$|All {{but one of}} his <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> black women. One of his {{suspected}} <b>victims</b> <b>was</b> a black man. Many of his <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> sex workers. One witness {{recalls that}} Franklin frequently brought sex workers into his home. He shot all of his victims with a [...]25 caliber gun. Franklin took many photographs of nude women and kept the records in his garage.|$|R
25|$|Twelve more murders followed, {{often with}} {{multiple}} bodies {{found on the}} same day. In addition to the earlier sprees, two <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> found each day from 14 July to 16. <b>Victims</b> <b>were</b> seemingly selected at random. Many were vulnerable to attack, including children, elderly, vagrants, or people {{under the influence of}} alcohol. Most <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> killed using blunt objects, including hammers and steel construction bars. Blows were often directed at their faces, leaving them unrecognizable. Many <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> also mutilated and tortured; some victims had their eyes gouged out while they were still alive. One pregnant woman had her fetus cut from her womb. No sexual assaults on any <b>victim</b> <b>were</b> reported. Some <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> also robbed of their cell phones and other valuables, their possessions pawned to second-hand shops in the area. However, most victims had their possessions intact. The murders covered a large geographical area. Aside from Dnepropetrovsk, many occurred in outlying areas of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.|$|R
5|$|While {{the courts}} in New Jersey allow actions based on dram shop {{liability}} or social host liability, they will instruct a jury to consider the intoxicated person's negligence under the doctrine of comparative negligence. Licensed establishments and social hosts may be liable for drunk driving accidents, assaults, falls, and other injuries and property damage caused by a customer, but are not liable for behavior which is unforeseeable (e.g. falling out of a tree), nor are they liable if they only served food or non-alcoholic beverages to a drunk patron. Dram shop and social host litigation may involve both compensatory and punitive damages. There is a 2-year statute of limitations for such lawsuits, but the time limit may be extended if the <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> a juvenile.|$|E
5|$|A second <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> found, {{this time}} a man whose eyes have been removed by forced surgery. Again, they {{discover}} the eyes were obtained from organ donation, and they find a connection to a woman called Amanda (Anja Savcic), a ballerina who had committed suicide. They also note the care that the culprit performed the work, and speculate that the person {{they are looking for}} is showing some compassion for his victims, calling for emergency help and using the serum to hope that they are given the proper care in time. They find that Amanda's alleged cremated remains are bogus, and that her body had been stolen before it could be cremated. They start to trace connections to Amanda, finding she was in a depression counseling support group. Though there are several possible suspects, Olivia's intuition leads her to a man named Roland David Barrett (Mark Ivanir), who was noted to have become enamored with Amanda at the meetings. At Roland's home, he has recovered the corpse and surgically replaced the organs in her body. Using a makeshift set of ropes and pulleys, Roland engages Amanda's body in a marionette act to make her perform like a ballerina, promising her he will bring her back to life.|$|E
5|$|Newcastle's Freewheels Theatre {{commissioned}} Nick Enright {{to produce}} a play that explored themes around the rape and murder. Titled A Property of the Clan, it premiered at the Freewheels Theatre in Newcastle in 1992, and was performed at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1993. The title {{was taken from the}} controversial quote in the psychological report on Webster made in preparation for his trial. Enright omitted the criminal acts and the murder from the play, instead focusing on the drama, its participants and the aftermath of the murder. The play was shown at various high schools in the Newcastle area, and following its positive reception was shown at high schools nationally, winning several awards. However, Newcastle High School, where both Leigh and Webster had been students, declined to show it. The play is set in the fictional town of Blackrock, and the rape and murder <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> named Tracy. Leigh's family requested that the name be changed, as 'Tracey' was the name of Leigh's cousin and best friend. The name remained, despite other revisions to the script; the play was retitled Blackrock. It was performed by the Sydney Theatre Company in 1995 and 1996.|$|E
50|$|The <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> casual {{workers and}} either Irish or Romani people. The Romanis were all from one {{extended}} family. The <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> aged between 59 years and 2 years old.|$|R
5000|$|Corll's <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> {{typically}} {{lured to}} {{a succession of}} addresses in which he resided between 1970 and 1973 with an offer of a party or a lift. They would then be restrained by either force or deception, and all were killed by either strangulation or shooting with a [...]22-caliber pistol. Corll and his accomplices buried 17 of their victims in a rented boat shed; four other <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> buried in woodland near Lake Sam Rayburn; one further <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> buried {{on a beach in}} Jefferson County; and at least six <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> buried on a beach on the Bolivar Peninsula.|$|R
50|$|According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, from 1980 to 2008, 84% {{of white}} {{homicide}} <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> killed by white offenders and 93% of black homicide <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> killed by black offenders.|$|R
5|$|Some {{versions}} of the myth provide Set's motive for killing Osiris. According to a spell in the Pyramid Texts, Set is taking revenge for a kick Osiris gave him, whereas in a Late Period text, Set's grievance is that Osiris had sex with Nephthys, who is Set's consort and the fourth child of Geb and Nut. The murder itself is frequently alluded to, but never clearly described. The Egyptians believed that written words {{had the power to}} affect reality, so they avoided writing directly about profoundly negative events such as Osiris's death. Sometimes they denied his death altogether, even though the bulk of the traditions about him make it clear that he has been murdered. In some cases the texts suggest that Set {{takes the form of a}} wild animal, such as a crocodile or bull, to slay Osiris; in others they imply that Osiris's corpse is thrown in the water or that he is drowned. This latter tradition is the origin of the Egyptian belief that people who had drowned in the Nile were sacred. Even the identity of the <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> changeable in texts, as it is sometimes the god Haroeris, an elder form of Horus, who is murdered by Set and then avenged by another form of Horus, who is Haroeris's son by Isis.|$|E
5|$|The episode's {{establishing}} exterior shots, {{and those}} of Tooms' house, were filmed around Hastings Street in Vancouver. When filming the first shot of Tooms' eyes glowing from a storm drain, the production crew arrived too late to secure the street for filming, and a nearby construction crew were temporarily drafted to guard the area. The ventilation system through which the first <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> attacked at night {{was meant to be}} of a multistory car park. However, to avoid a costly tenting operation to simulate night-time, a replica of the necessary parts of the ventilation system was built in a lower level of the car park. Exterior shots of Scully's apartment were also filmed in Vancouver, at the same location used in the pilot episode. However, this location's use was later discontinued owing to the limited range of shots it afforded; most reverse angles would show a large car park across the street.|$|E
5|$|The way the {{painting}} shows {{the progress of}} time is also without precedent in Western art. The death of a blameless victim had typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with the virtue of heroism. The Third of May offers no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned in a mechanical formalization of murder. The inevitable outcome {{is seen in the}} corpse of a man, splayed {{on the ground in the}} lower left portion of the work. There is no room left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured to a degree that renders resurrection impossible. The <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> portrayed bereft of all aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture the viewer's eye level is mostly along the central horizontal axis; only here is the perspectival point of view changed, so that the viewer looks down on the mutilated body.|$|E
50|$|When <b>Victim</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on VHS in the U.S. in 1986, it received the PG-13 rating. When <b>Victim</b> <b>was</b> re-released in the United Kingdom, it was reclassified with the much milder PG/12 rating.|$|R
50|$|In 1951 {{the remains}} of the 86 <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> reinterred in one {{location}} in the Cronenbourg-Strasbourg Jewish Cemetery. On 11 December 2005 memorial stones engraved with the names of the 86 <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> placed at the cemetery. One is {{at the site of the}} mass grave, the other along the wall of the cemetery. Another plaque honoring the <b>victims</b> <b>was</b> placed outside the Anatomy Institute at Strasbourg's University Hospital.|$|R
5000|$|Kraft's <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> {{typically}} lured {{into his}} vehicle {{with an offer}} of a lift or alcohol. Inside Kraft's vehicle, the <b>victims</b> would <b>be</b> plied with alcohol and/or other drugs. They were then bound, tortured, and sexually abused before they were usually killed by either strangulation, asphyxiation, or bludgeoning, although some victims had also ingested fatal doses of pharmaceuticals {{and at least one}} <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> stabbed to death. The <b>victims</b> would then <b>be</b> discarded, usually—though not exclusively—alongside or close to various freeways in southern California. (Photographic evidence found at Kraft's home indicates several of his <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> driven to his house before their murder.) ...|$|R
25|$|Sexual {{abuse in}} the first degree is a Class D felony if the <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> 12 to 17 years old, and a Class C felony if the <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> under 12.|$|E
25|$|Frankenstein, or The Vampire's <b>Victim</b> <b>is</b> an 1887 musical burlesque {{composed}} by Meyer Lutz and written by Richard Henry.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of neglect}} include {{failing to provide}} {{sufficient}} supervision, nourishment, medical care or other needs for which the <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> helpless to provide for themselves.|$|E
50|$|One {{implication}} of the identifiable <b>victim</b> effect <b>is</b> identifiable <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely to be}} helped than statistical victims.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, The Guardian counted 1093 {{people who}} {{were killed by the}} police. Out of these 574 were white and 266 were black. 95 of the white <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> unarmed, 42 of the black <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> unarmed.|$|R
25|$|The {{identities of}} all <b>victims</b> have <b>been</b> confirmed, {{according}} to the local government. The youngest <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> 12 years old.|$|R
