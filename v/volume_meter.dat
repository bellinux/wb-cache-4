40|$|Abstract: To {{clarify the}} effects of {{changing}} shift schedules from a full-day to a half-day before a night shift, 12 single nurses and 18 married nurses with children that engaged in night shift work in a Japanese hospital were investigated. Subjects worked 2 different shift patterns consisting of a night shift after a half-day shift (HF-N) and a night shift after a day shift (D-N). Physical activity levels were recorded with a physical activity <b>volume</b> <b>meter</b> to measure sleep/wake time more precisely without restricting subjects ’ activities. The duration of sleep before a night shift of married nurses was significantly shorter than that of single nurses for both shift schedules. Changing shift from the D-N to the HF-N increased the duration of sleep before a night shift for both groups, and made wake-up time earlier for single nurses only. Repeated ANCOVA of the series of physical activities showed significant differences with shift (p< 0. 01) and marriage (p< 0. 01) for variances, and age (p< 0. 05) for a covariance. The paired t-test to compare {{the effects of}} changing shift patterns in each subject group and ANCOVA for examining the hourly activity differences between single and married nurses showed {{that the effects of}} a change in shift schedules seemed to have less effect on married nurses than single nurses.

40|$|Measurement {{of ammonia}} {{emission}} were performed from pig and cattle slurry storage and from manu-re heaps. Measurement from slurry stores were performed {{by means of}} a specific system consisting of a 0. 138 m 2 captor, a trap containing 400 ml of a 1 % boric acid solution, a vacuum pump, an interceptor trap, a <b>volume</b> <b>meter</b> and a flow-meter. The device is arranged to suck the air from the funnel with a flow rate of 9 l/min. The ammonia present in air is then fixed by the boric acid solution into ammonium borate and its concentration can be rapidly determined by titration with 0, 1 N Sulfuric acid. The captors were moun-ted on a special polystyrene and wooden floating frame and placed on the slurry surface. The captors are let free to float on the slurry surface so that the area subjected to the measurement changes continuously. Measurements of ammonia emission from manure heaps were performed by means of Open Large Dynamic Chamber. Trials, carried out along the four seasons with cattle (8 - 10 %TS) and pig (3 - 4 % TS) slurry, pointed out ammonia losses up to 1. 6 g NH 3. m 2 and 2. 5 g NH 3. m 2 per day respectively.

The product was designed and developed for Stigsjö Skog och Frö AB in Härnösand. It was developed taking into account a number of requirements set by the supervisor David Zetterlund. The main requirements were that the volume measurement would be fast and give accurate results. These are two requirements that are missing in today's volume measuring method which is very problematic for the company. The plant was visited several times in Härnösand, mainly to discuss the generated concepts with the supervisor and perform tests on the prototype. The supervisor has been involved and contributed important suggestions and comments.  At the beginning we generated {{a number of different}} concepts. This was done in two phases of concept generation. In faze one; concepts were discussed after which the least suitable was removed. In phase two we also discussed the development prospects of the remaining concepts. Inspired by some of these concepts, a final concept was created for further development. The development of the chosen concept began with selecting and designing appropriate subcomponents. There after appropriate engineering materials were chosen. A series of tests were conducted on a prototype. There were also carried out finite element calculations of the subcomponents that were considered to be exposed to maximum stress state. The next step was to examine whether the finished product meets the set requirements. In conclusion and in view of the set cost limitations a study was carried out on how viable the solution is for the company. The investigations conducted showed that the final product met the set requirements. This applies particularly to the cost limitations, volume measurement accuracy and volume measurement speed. It was also produced full drawings with detailed CAD models. The product is therefore ready for production...|$|E
40|$|The {{groundwater}} {{monitoring programme}} continued throughout 1999. Monitoring of selected groundwater levels has been undertaken {{on a monthly}} basis, whereas samples for chemical analysis are collected twice yearly. The field work was undertaken jointly by Kate Little and Clare Le Breuilley at the Public Services Department and the inorganic chemical analyses overseen by Kate Little. A dialogue was maintained during the year with the British Geological Survey at Wallingford and an advisory visit was made to Jersey by Mike Bird. As in 1998, the database has been maintained at Bellozanne, although duplicate groundwater level data are retained at Wallingford. Only one site has been lost during the year, that at JEC at St Helier. However, collection of pump <b>volume</b> <b>meter</b> readings has been discontinued at all sites visited only for that purpose; the density of data being collected on pumping rates had become inadequate and the residual data of limited value. This area can be reassessed {{in the event that}} appropriate supportive legislation is invoked. Additional activities include a data recovery exercise from the foundation site engineering work that has been carried out in recent years around St Helier. This has produced a catalogue of hydrogeological data, their whereabouts and format, and a report (Cheney, 2000). In addition a number of ad hoc enquiries have been answered relating to specific problems. These include the proposed extension to Granite Products Limited quarry, the St Ouen’s fire ground pollution incident, and issues raised by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.

40|$|A {{pavement}} construction {{designed to}} cope with the different type of traffic loads; it is exposed to {{and at the same time}} it can resist the effect of the climate. A road structure consists of sub- and superstructure which is divided by a boundary known as terrace. During the construction of unbound layers (base course and sub-base course) in the superstructure, it is always ensured that the material meet the requirements for bearing capacity and the degree of compaction. These parameters are controlled by various laboratory tests and control methods. To obtain increased knowledge of the material and improve the quality of the compaction in the field, it is necessary to perform laboratory tests in order to determine material properties. A base course material 0 / 32 mm limestone from Gotland (Hejdeby) was investigated in this study. To determine properties of the material various laboratory tests such as proctor compaction test, Micro-Deval, Los Angeles, and grain distribution curve are conducted. To investigate how grain size distribution affects technical properties of the material, the 0 / 32 mm material was modified with two different samples; grain size distribution of 2 / 32 mm excluding superior material content, and 0 +/ 32 mm with enhanced superior material content. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in material behavior during proctor compaction. Two aspects of changes in material behavior were emphasized in this study; the optimal water content and maximum dry density, as well as changes of both. As a reference for the limestone features, a traditional 0 / 32 mm tonalite material (granite) from Vällstaverket was used relating to proctor investigation. Material's resistance to abrasion and fragmentation was investigated by two methods: Micro-Deval and Los Angeles. The results were compared with other rock materials. Furthermore the bearing capacity of the material was verified by examination of the Young's modulus and degree of compaction, as well as properties of water content and dry density, at three trial areas on Gotland. This is performed with various methods such as static plate loading test, light weight deflectometer, density gauge/SDG 200, and water/sand <b>volume</b> <b>meter</b> measurement test. By comparing results from different methods of measurement, it may indicate a relationship between these. Test area 3 consists of two smaller test areas which have different water content. The bearing capacity (Young's modulus) and the degree of compaction were measured after each roller passage. Different relationships were obtained between the amount of roller overpass, with Young's modulus of material; as well as degree of compaction. It was found in this study that limestone from Gotland (Hejdeby) maintain its position as construction material for the unbound layers of the road. The result from static plate load which indicated high E V 2 values (Young's modulus) was obtained from the field, and it suggests that a fine bearing capacity can be achieved in the use of limestone...|$|E

40|$|Retention of {{ventilation}} {{skills by}} emergency nurses three {{and six months}} after training: Smart Bag compared with standard bag. De Regge Melissa, Vogels C, Calle PA, Monsieurs KG. Ghent University Hospital, Belgium and Cliniques Universitaires St. Luc, Brussels, Belgium. Background: The ERC 2000 Guidelines recommend tidal volumes (Vt) of only 400 - 600 ml and inspiratory times (Ti) between one and two seconds to reduce gastric insufflation (GI) with Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) devices (1). Studies {{have shown that the}} SMART BAG® (SB, O-Two Medical Technologies Inc. Canada) reduces GI by the use of a pressure/flow responsive valve (2, 3). Purpose: 1. 	To assess ventilation skills of emergency department (ED) nurses with a Standard BVM (STBVM) and the SB before and after CPR training focusing on limiting Vt and prolonging Ti. We hypothesized that after 3 and 6 months the SB would facilitate the maintenance of good quality ventilation. 2. 	To identify ventilation parameters associated with GI. Materials and methods We utilized a CPR training manikin (Simulaids, USA) equipped with an oesophagus and a PEEP valve set at 20 cm H 20 simulating the lower oesophageal sphincter pressure. Ti, Vt and peak pressure (Pp) were measured (CPRview®, Michigan Instruments, USA). GI was measured with a <b>volume</b> <b>meter</b> (Medishield, UK). Prior to training, 39 ED nurses performed CPR for 2 minutes, in pairs, using a STBVM (Laerdal, Norway) to assess their baseline skills. Immediately following training they were retested using an O-Two STBVM and a SB. Twenty nurses were retested after 3 months, 19 after 6 months. Efficient ventilation was defined as a mean Vt > 400 ml and GI 400 ml, cases without GI had longer Ti and lower Pp than cases with GI (Ti 1. 29 s versus 1. 00 s, p= 0. 003, Pp 17 cm H 20 versus 8 cm H 20, p 400 ml had even longer Ti (1. 47 s) and lower Pp (7. 5 cm H 20) than STBVM cases. Of all efficient ventilations with a STBVM, 11 / 37 (30 %) had Vt > 600 ml Conclusions: 1. 	Skills assessment: a. 	Ventilation techniques at base line were poor with GI and hypoventilation as the major problems, justifying training. b. 	After training, only 47 % of nurses ventilated efficiently, mainly because of hypoventilation. c. 	In contrast with STBVM, SB resulted in better skills after 6 months compared with base line. 2. 	Ventilation parameters: a. 	Short Ti and high Pp are associated with GI in the STBVM. b. 	The SB achieved good volumes at the longest Ti and lowest Pp. There was never GI with the SB. c. 	Long Ti and reduced Pp prevented GI with STBVM even at Vt > 600 ml. d. 	Training should focus on prolonging Ti and not only on limiting Vt. References: 1. de Latorre F, Nolan J, Robertson C, et al.
