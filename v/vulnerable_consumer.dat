40|$|Abstract: The {{purchase}} of a product or service by a consumer directly abroad and the remote consumption of goods are the two main ways in which transnational consumption occurs. This new contractual dynamic – {{a direct result of}} the development of transport and communication facilities- has consequences not only for consumer protection but also for trade law. It demands from doctrine, courts and legislators an effort to solve problems arising therefrom. Important lessons can be learned from the application of economic theory to law among the difficulties to fit private international law to constitutional principles. New paradigms proposed by the courts in recent years brought great expectations in the national legal system to the evolution of consumer protection concerning international trade. Theoretical developments are now necessary to elaborate regulatory proposals under trademark and corporate law- with particular attention to financial institutions-so as to grant greater protection to the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumer</b> assuring security and predictability to the system, which are essential to the correct operation of the market...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> can be involved in transformative service design and how this approach may enhance the design of such services. The study also analyzes how co-design with <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> differs from existing user involvement processes with the purpose of developing a co-design framework. Design/methodology/approach – A case study approach was employed, with six high schools in Australia identified as sites to conduct co-design sessions for a school-based alcohol education program. Adolescents were invited to review and (re) design an existing alcohol education program. Findings – The study indicates that co-design with <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> cannot be approached in the same way as conventional user involvement processes. Based on the insights generated from six co-design sessions as well as the examination of user involvement and co-design literature, the authors propose a six-step co-design framework. The six steps comprise resourcing, planning, recruiting, sensitizing, facilitation and evaluation. Research limitations/implications – The co-design framework illustrates important differences to conventional user involvement processes. However, the generalizability of the research findings is limited to a specific study setting and a narrowly defined sample. Future research in a different setting is needed to further validate the presented findings. Practical implications – For service design practice, this study provides guidelines on how co-design activities with <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> can be effectively resourced, planned, recruited, sensitized, facilitated and evaluated. The framework outlines how co-design may be applied so that <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> can become empowered participants during the design process.

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to examine}} the service {{experience}} in an online support community of consumers {{to understand the nature}} of social support and how it is experienced and enacted by <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers.</b> Design/methodology/approach: A netnographic study was conducted to examine vulnerable consumers’ participation in an online support group for weight management. The Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) program was used, and additionally data were coded using open coding. A hybrid approach to data analysis was undertaken using inductive and deductive methods. Findings: The findings suggest online social support groups can be used as an online “third place” to support <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers,</b> with <b>vulnerable</b> groups engaging with the online support group differently than those in the normal weight group. Social support was also found to be bi-directional in nature. Research limitations/implications: This study only investigates one online support group. To gain deeper insights, other support groups should be examined over a longer period. Practical implications: This paper demonstrates that transformative services have the hidden capacity to optimize their services to enable <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> to co-create social support in a safe place, thus providing a non-judgmental environment with the end goal of improving their health and well-being. Social implications: Findings reveal how services can enable marginalization and stigmatization to be overcome and inspire social action through the use of online support groups. Originality/value: This research is unique in that it used a netnography approach to examine how <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> interact in an online service setting, reducing self-report bias and allowing for a natural research setting, thus allowing a unique understanding of how <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> experience and enact social support.

The increase is especially problematic for those least able to afford debt of any kind - welfare recipients. This qualitative study reports on 120 Australian welfare recipients' attitudes towards debt, their understanding about what constitutes acceptable debt and the debt-management strategies they adopt. The results of this research show that welfare recipients see debt {{as a way of life}} and as a means of survival in a society where a core value appears (to them) to be the acquisition of material wealth. Their status as income earners and therefore their capacity to service debt is less than others. Consequently, we could expect that their debt levels would be proportionally less; however, many participants in this research did not appear to understand the long term consequences of their level of debt.

Realizing {{differences in the}} consumption behaviors of economically better-off and impoverished consumers, some researchers explored how poor consumers cope with economic restrictions {{in a world of}} abundance. Lewis (1970), for example, argued that poor consumers did not behave according to the dictates of higher-income people, while others claimed that consumption values were the same regardless of consumer’s level of income (e. g.

Holloway and Cardozo 1969); on the other hand, they were perceived to be capable of find-ing their own ways to optimize their purchases in terms of assortments of products (e. g. An-dreasen 1975).

40|$|Public service {{deregulation}} is favoured for motivating {{providers to}} offer consumers better price-quality services. Consequently, consumers are enabled {{to make informed}} choices and choose for the best service provider. However, recent publications reveal that consumers are not capable of exercising optimal choice behaviour. Despite these concerns, evidence is lacking {{on the extent to}} which potentially vulnerable consumers make use of the core element of deregulation—switching health plans. This article is meant to study whether potentially vulnerable consumers do indeed switch less health plans in the deregulated Dutch health insurance market than regular consumers. In order to answer this question, we extract questionnaire data from the LISS panel, covering the years 2009 - 2012. A total of 16, 779 health insurance consumers were included in the sample. The average response rate was 78 %. Logistic regression results show that consumers being chronically ill, 60 and older, and without Internet access, do indeed switch less often. Intriguingly, non-working consumers and those living equal to or below the poverty line, turn out to switch more often than regular consumers. As a result, we conclude that the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumer</b> in the Dutch health insurance market is described by the following characteristics: chronically ill, 60 and older, and without Internet access.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{the impact}} of section 22 of the Consumer Protection Act, 68 of 2008 on the {{drafting}} of contracts in South Africa is investigated. It was shown {{that there has been}} a great shift internationally to the drafting of consumer documents in plain language. Some jurisdictions even have statutory guidelines for drafting in plain language. The benefits of drafting in plain language were also mentioned. The South African plain language drafting situation is quite unique, with the question of what the characteristics of an ordinary consumer are, posing to be the most important question in determining specific plain language guidelines for South African consumers. It was found that there are potentially more than one type of ordinary consumer, depending on the type of commercial transaction being entered into. Although no statutory plain language drafting guidelines have been published in South Africa, it was suggested that our common law rules of interpretation are a valuable starting point when looking for guidelines for better drafting. This dissertation concludes that two sets of guidelines be developed for at least two levels of commercial transactions. Firstly, the international guidelines of Kimble should be incorporated into our law for consumer contracts relating to more complex consumer transactions. Secondly, another set of guidelines relating to the use of illustrations, examples, headings or other aids to reading and understanding, as envisioned by the CPA, should be developed for use in everyday consumer contracts where the typical consumer is illiterate or falls into the so called <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumer</b> category.

40|$|Effectively {{designed}} complaint {{handling systems}} {{play a key}} role in enabling vulnerable consumers to complain and obtain redress. This article examines current research into consumer vulnerability, highlighting its multidimensional and expansive nature. Contemporary understandings of consumer vulnerability recognize that the interaction between a wide range of market and consumer characteristics can combine to place any individual at risk of vulnerability. While this broad definition of consumer vulnerability reflects the complex reality of consumers' experiences, it poses a key challenge for designers of complaint handling systems: how can they identify and respond to an issue which can potentially affect everyone? Drawing on current research and practice in the United Kingdom and Australia, the article analyses the impact of consumer vulnerability on third party dispute resolution schemes and considers the role these complaint handling organizations can play in supporting their complainants. Third party complaint handling organizations, including a range of Alternative Dispute Resolution services such as ombudsman organizations, can {{play a key role}} in increasing access to justice for <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumer</b> groups and provide specific assistance for individual complainants during the process. It is an opportune time to review whether the needs of consumers at risk of vulnerability are being met within complaint processes and the extent to which third party complaint handlers support those who are most vulnerable to seek redress. Empowering vulnerable consumers to complain presents specific challenges. The article discusses the application of a new model of consumer dispute system design to show how complaint handling organizations can meet the needs of the most vulnerable consumers throughout the process. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Our {{climate of}} mass consumption, {{as well as}} the {{aggressive}} marketing techniques targeting <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers,</b> both entrench the false belief that ‘‘you’ve got to go into debt to get anywhere’’.

This unwillingness to communicate openly about debt makes it difﬁcult to address the issue with public education strategies. Extreme debt practices signify a revolving door to poverty because some people, like the welfare participants in this study, do not recognise they are in debt.

As this contribution is an attempt to provide an interdisciplinary analysis from a legal perspective, identification of what is considered to be an ‘elderly’ consumer, needs to be assessed by referring to relevant empirical studies from both an international as well as South African perspective. The focus of this study is on the protection of the elderly as a category of vulnerable consumers in terms of the CPA. The investigation will attempt to show that the elderly is protected in terms of all eight of the fundamental consumer rights within the CPA. Special reference will be made to two fundamental rights of the consumer in terms of the CPA. First, the elderly consumer’s right to equality in the consumer market (Part A of the CPA) which provides additional protection as the CPA also refers to the Constitutional right to equality. Second, the elderly consumer’s the right to fair and responsible marketing (Part E of the CPA) which in terms of the research is compared with the EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. Certain problems regarding elderly consumers are identified and the importance of consumer rights as well as the implementation of the correct consumer policy is argued. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|During the {{previous}} decade from 2004 to 2013, people in China witnessed both skyrocketing number of food safety crises, and aggregating regulatory initiatives attempting to control these crises. Indeed, numerous food safety crises promoted intuitional reforms and innovations, together with adoption of complex rules and legislation within the regulatory regime of food safety, multiple cycles of “crisis—regulatory efforts”, however, still indicated the systematic incapacity of the food safety regime to tackle with crises. Therefore, the fundamental research problem that structures this thesis is to understand the causes of this systemic failure in the “social foundations” for the regulatory governance of food safety. The thesis locates the proximate causes of the regulatory failure of food safety regime in China in the regulatory segmentation of the regime. This thesis {{is supported by the}} differential impacts of the food regulatory regime on various consumer groups. Through compartmentalised regulatory arrangements, the regulatory segmentation reduced the political incentives for enforcement and compliance of food safety regulations, directly leading to unbalanced distribution of regulatory incentives and resource in which the benefits of the food safety regime were felt mostly by well-connected and affluent consumer groups. Conversely it impacted adversely on poorer and <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumer</b> groups. Such uneven food safety level has further been intensified through a compound of emerging factors in China: politicised social stratification, deepening economic liberalisation, modernisation of the food industry, food trade, and growing food chain and demand. This thesis analyses how this system of regulatory segmentation has been historically embedded into the food safety regime in China, and how it has further been stabilised and institutionalised over time. Based on the theoretical framework construction and historical review, the thesis explains how this segmented food safety regime has been delivering benefits and burdens among different sectors of population, unevenly unfortunately, through analysing different aspects of food safety management. A key contribution of this thesis is to identify and locate the social foundation for this segmented regulatory system, which in turn helps to explain the systemic failure of the food safety regime in China.
