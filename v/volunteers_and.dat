Brock also began seeking out First Nations leaders, such as the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, to build alliances with him against the Americans in the event of war. Although the conventional wisdom of the day was that Canada would fall quickly {{in the event of an}} invasion, Brock pursued these strategies to give the colony a fighting chance.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the relative importance of}} best friend's <b>and</b> parents' <b>volunteering</b> <b>and</b> civic family orientation (combined with open family communication) in adolescent <b>volunteering,</b> <b>and</b> the moderating effect of age. Results, involving 698 adolescents (M age = 15. 19; SD = 1. 43), revealed that adolescents were more likely to volunteer when their best friend <b>and</b> parents <b>volunteered,</b> <b>and</b> <b>volunteered</b> more frequently when their family had a stronger civic orientation combined with more open family communication. Clear age differences were found: when adolescents get older, friends become more important for whether they <b>volunteer,</b> <b>and</b> the family's civic orientation becomes important for their volunteering frequency. An implication of these findings may be that, depending on adolescents' age and the aspect of volunteering, interventions may focus on targeting parents' or friend's civic behaviour to stimulate adolescent volunteering...|$|R
