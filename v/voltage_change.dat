5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} uses a constant current power source, {{meaning that the}} current (and thus the heat) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and <b>voltage</b> <b>change.</b> This is important because most applications of GTAW are manual or semiautomatic, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult.|$|E
5|$|The {{power supply}} used in SMAW has {{constant}} current output, {{ensuring that the}} current (and thus the heat) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and <b>voltage</b> <b>change.</b> This is important because most applications of SMAW are manual, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult. However, because the current is not maintained absolutely constant, skilled welders performing complicated welds can vary the arc length to cause minor fluctuations in the current.|$|E
25|$|Output voltage varies about 1.2% {{for every}} 1% change in supply frequency. For example, a 2Hz change in {{generator}} frequency, {{which is very}} large, results in an output <b>voltage</b> <b>change</b> of only 4%, which has little effect for most loads.|$|E

Physically, the rheostat hardware is more to distance detector looks. For interfacing process, PCI – 1710 is used to dispatch the <b>voltage</b> <b>changes</b> data to computer program.

25|$|Other {{methods of}} testing include electroanalysis (amperometric approach), where ·NO reacts with an {{electrode}} to induce a current or <b>voltage</b> <b>change.</b> The detection of NO radicals in biological tissues is particularly difficult due to the short lifetime and concentration of these radicals in tissues. One of the few practical methods is spin trapping of nitric oxide with iron-dithiocarbamate complexes and subsequent detection of the mono-nitrosyl-iron complex with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR).|$|E
25|$|Henneman {{proposed}} that the mechanism underlying the Size Principle was that the smaller motor neurons had a smaller surface area and therefore a higher membrane resistance. He predicted that the current generated by an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSPs) {{would result in a}} higher <b>voltage</b> <b>change</b> (depolarization) across the neuronal membrane of the smaller motor neurons and therefore larger EPSPs in smaller motoneurons. Burke later demonstrated that there was a graded decrease of both EPSP and inhibitory post synaptic potential (IPSP) amplitudes from small to large motoneurons. This seemed to confirm Henneman's idea, but Burke disagreed, pointing out that larger neurons with a larger surface area had space for more synapses. Burke eventually showed (in a very small sample of neurons) that smaller motoneurons have a greater number of synaptic inputs from a single input source. The topic is probably still regarded as controversial.|$|E
500|$|The {{nerve impulse}} is characterised {{by a great}} influx of sodium ions through {{channels}} in the neuron's cell membrane followed by an efflux of potassium ions through other channels. The neuron is unable to fire again {{for a short time}} (known as the refractory period), which is mediated by another potassium channel. The flow through these ion channels is governed by a [...] "gate" [...] which is opened by either a <b>voltage</b> <b>change</b> or a chemical messenger known as a ligand (such as a neurotransmitter). These channels are another target for anticonvulsant drugs.|$|E
50|$|In an {{electrical}} synapse, the presynaptic and postsynaptic cell membranes are connected by special channels called gap junctions or synaptic cleft that {{are capable of}} passing an electric current, causing <b>voltage</b> <b>changes</b> in the presynaptic cell to induce <b>voltage</b> <b>changes</b> in the postsynaptic cell. The main advantage of {{an electrical}} synapse is the rapid transfer of signals from one cell to the next.|$|R

2500|$|Thyristors can be {{triggered}} by a high rise-rate of off-state voltage. This is prevented by connecting a resistor-capacitor (RC) snubber circuit between the anode and cathode [...] in order to limit the dV/dt (i.e., rate of <b>voltage</b> <b>change</b> over time).|$|E
2500|$|Line {{regulation}} {{or input}} regulation {{is the degree}} to which output voltage changes with input (supply) voltage changes - as a ratio of output to input change (for example, [...] "typically 13mV/V"), or the output <b>voltage</b> <b>change</b> over the entire specified input voltage range (for example, [...] "plus or minus 2% for input voltages between 90V and 260V, 50-60Hz").|$|E
2500|$|The {{negative}} {{electrostatic field}} {{created by the}} grid {{in the vicinity of}} the cathode would inhibit passage of emitted electrons and reduce the current to the plate. Thus, a few volt difference at the grid would make a large change in the plate current and could lead to a much larger <b>voltage</b> <b>change</b> at the plate; the result was voltage and power amplification. In 1908, De Forest was granted a patent (...) for such a three-electrode version of his original Audion for use as an electronic amplifier in radio communications.
