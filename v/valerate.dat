25|$|Several C17β ester prodrugs of DHT, {{including}} androstanolone benzoate, androstanolone enanthate, androstanolone propionate, and androstanolone <b>valerate,</b> {{have been}} developed and introduced for medical use as AAS. Conversely, dihydrotestosterone acetate, dihydrotestosterone butyrate, and dihydrotestosterone formate {{have been developed}} but have not been marketed.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} salts of {{morphine}} are used, {{with the most}} common in current clinical use being the hydrochloride, sulfate, tartrate, and citrate; less commonly methobromide, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, lactate, chloride, and bitartrate and the others listed below. Morphine diacetate, which is another name for heroin, is a Schedule I controlled substance, {{so it is not}} used clinically in the United States; it is a sanctioned medication in the United Kingdom and in Canada and some countries in Continental Europe, its use being particularly common (nearly to the degree of the hydrochloride salt) in the United Kingdom. Morphine meconate is a major form of the alkaloid in the poppy, as is morphine pectinate, nitrate, sulphate, and some others. Like codeine, dihydrocodeine and other (especially older) opiates, morphine has been used as the salicylate salt by some suppliers and can be easily compounded, imparting the therapeutic advantage of both the opioid and the NSAID; multiple barbiturate salts of morphine were also used in the past, as was/is morphine <b>valerate,</b> the salt of the acid being the active principle of valerian. Calcium morphenate is the intermediate in various latex and poppy-straw methods of morphine production, more rarely sodium morphenate takes its place. Morphine ascorbate and other salts such as the tannate, citrate, and acetate, phosphate, <b>valerate</b> and others may be present in poppy tea depending on the method of preparation. Morphine <b>valerate</b> produced industrially was one ingredient of a medication available for both oral and parenteral administration popular many years ago in Europe and elsewhere called Trivalin (not {{to be confused with the}} current, unrelated herbal preparation of the same name), which also included the valerates of caffeine and cocaine, with a version containing codeine <b>valerate</b> as a fourth ingredient being distributed under the name Tetravalin.|$|E
25|$|Prasterone is {{sometimes}} {{used as an}} androgen in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopause. In addition to prasterone itself, a long-lasting ester prodrug of prasterone, prasterone enanthate, is used in combination with estradiol <b>valerate</b> {{for the treatment of}} menopausal symptoms under the brand name Gynodian Depot.|$|E
50|$|Pantopon is, {{in other}} words, opium {{with all of}} the tar and other insolubles removed in an {{injectable}} form which, by weight, is nearly as potent as morphine. It was invented in 1909 by the Hoffmann-La Roche pharmaceutical company. Other drugs of the same type have included opium alkaloid sulphates (Papaveretum), phosphates, and <b>valerates.</b>|$|R
40|$|Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are {{biodegradable}} polyesters {{which are}} synthesized by manybacteria. They are accumulated intracellularly as carbon and energy reserves {{under certain conditions}} like, inthe presence of excess carbon source. The oldest known such polymer is poly hydroxy butyrate (PHB). However, commercial exploitation of such polymers have not been seriously attempted due to several reasonsand one such reason is that PHB is not flexible as expected. It has also been pointed out that if PHB is blendedsuitably with certain other PHAs like polyhydroxy <b>valerates</b> (PHV) then the resultant material is more strongand flexible than PHB. The present investigation is aimed at production of PHV along with PHB from Bacillusmegaterium NCIM 2475 and {{the results show that}} this was made up of PHB-co-PHV when grown in presenceof sucrose...|$|R
30|$|Rising oil prices, {{unstable}} {{supply and}} the demand for sustainable environmental friendly energy sources have increased the interest in research and development of biomass resources for fuels such as bio-ethanol. Carbohydrates are a natural resource commonly available as lignocellulosic biomass that can be hydrolyzed into sugars to be further converted via fermentative or thermochemical processes into useful products (Zhang 2008; Arora et al. 2015). Among the important products that can be derived are ethanol (cellulosic), butanol and similar advanced fuels, platform chemicals such as acetone, furfural, levulinic acid, gamma valerolactone and bioplastics such as polyhydroxy butyrates or <b>valerates</b> (Zhang 2008; Singh et al. 2008; Galbe and Zacchi 2002; Bhuwal et al. 2014). These products are a substitute for fossil fuels or starch-based carbohydrates, thus providing an alternate sustainable resource. The plastics are biodegradable and thus are beneficial to the environment in comparison to petrochemicals and their derivatives (Kale et al. 2007). Cellulosic biomass is a promising material for bio-energy that avoids the usage of corn and other food grains and thus avoids the necessity of competing with edible sugars. One good source of cellulosic biomass is the waste rejects from recycled linerboard mills which manufacture packaging paper from old corrugated containerboard (OCC).|$|R
25|$|Estradiol, estrone, and estriol {{have all}} been {{approved}} as pharmaceutical drugs and are used medically. Estetrol is currently under development for medical indications, but {{has not yet been}} approved in any country. A variety of synthetic estrogen esters, such as estradiol <b>valerate,</b> estradiol cypionate, estradiol acetate, estradiol undecylate, polyestradiol phosphate, and estradiol benzoate, are used clinically. The aforementioned compounds behave as prodrugs to estradiol, and are longer-lasting in comparison. Esters of estrone and estriol also exist and are employed in clinical medicine.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, Butenandt {{found that}} the benzoic acid ester of estrone had a {{prolonged}} duration of action. Subsequently, Schwenk and Hildebrant synthesized estradiol benzoate from estradiol in 1933, and estradiol benzoate was introduced by Schering-Kahlbaum for medical use via intramuscular injection under the brand name Progynon-B in 1936. It was the first estrogen ester to be marketed, and has since been followed by many additional esters, for instance estradiol <b>valerate</b> and estradiol cypionate in the 1950s. Ethinylestradiol was synthesized from estradiol by Inhoffen and Hohlweg in 1938 and was introduced for oral use by Schering in the United States under the brand name Estinyl in 1943. It remains widely used in combined oral contraceptives.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen {{is one of}} the {{two major}} sex hormones in XX chromosomed {{individuals}} (the other being progesterone), and is responsible for the development and maintenance of feminine secondary sexual characteristics, such as breasts, wide hips, and a feminine pattern of fat distribution. Estrogens act by binding to and activating the estrogen receptor (ER), their biological target in the body. A variety of different forms of estrogen are available and used medically. The most common estrogens used in transgender women include estradiol (which is the predominant natural estrogen in women) and estradiol esters such as estradiol <b>valerate</b> and estradiol cypionate (which are prodrugs of estradiol). Conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs), marketed as Premarin, and ethinylestradiol are also sometimes used, but this is becoming less common. Estrogens may be administered orally, sublingually, transdermally (via patch), topically (via gel), by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, or by an implant.|$|E
40|$|Acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase catalyzes the {{conversion}} of acetohydroxy acids into dihydroxy <b>valerates.</b> This reaction is the second in the synthetic pathway of the essential branched side chain amino acids valine and isoleucine. Because this pathway is absent from animals, the enzymes involved in it are good targets for a systematic search for herbicides. The crystal structure of acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase complexed with cofactor NADPH, Mg 2 + ions and a competitive inhibitor with herbicidal activity, N-hydroxy-N-isopropyloxamate, was solved to 1. 65 A resolution and refined to an R factor of 18. 7 % and an R free of 22. 9 %. The asymmetric unit shows two functional dimers related by non-crystallographic symmetry. The active site, nested at the interface between the NADPH-binding domain and the all-helical C-terminus domain, shows a situation analogous to the transition state. It contains two Mg 2 + ions interacting with the inhibitor molecule and bridged by the carboxylate moiety of an aspartate residue. The inhibitor-binding site is well adjusted to it, with a hydrophobic pocket and a polar region. Only 24 amino acids are conserved among known acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase sequences {{and all of these}} are located around the active site. Finally, a 140 amino acid region, present in plants but absent from other species, was found to make up most of the dimerization domain...|$|R
40|$|The uptake of glucose and the {{formation}} of end products from glucose catabolism have been measured for sediments of eutrophic Wintergreen Lake with a combination of tritiated and 14 C-labeled tracers. Time course analyses of the loss of [3 H]glucose from sediments were used to establish rate constants for glucose uptake at natural substrate concentrations. Turnover times from these analyses were about 1 min for littoral and profundal sediments. No seasonal or site differences were noted in turnover times. Time course analyses of [U- 14 C]glucose uptake and 14 C-labeled end product formation indicated that glucose mass flow could not be calculated from end product formation since the specific activity of added [14 C]glucose was significantly diluted by pools of intracellular glucose and glucose metabolites. Mass flow could only be accurately estimated by use of rates of uptake from tracer studies. Intermediate fermentation end products included acetate (71 %), propionate (15 %), lactate (9 %), and only minor amounts of butyrates or <b>valerates.</b> Addition of H 2 to sediments resulted in greater production of lactate (28 %) and decreased formation of acetate (50 %), but did not affect glucose turnover. Depth profiles of glucose uptake indicated that rates of uptake decreased with depth over the 0 - to 18 -cm interval and that glucose uptake accounted for 30 to 40 % of methanogenesis in profundal sediments...|$|R
40|$|The rates, products, and {{controls}} of the metabolism of fermentation intermediates in the sediments of a eutrophic lake were examined. 14 C-fatty acids were directly injected into sediment subcores for turnover rate measurements. The {{highest rates of}} acetate turnover were in surface sediments (0 - to 2 -cm depth). Methane was the dominant product of acetate metabolism at all depths. Simultaneous measurements of acetate, propionate, and lactate turnover in surface sediments gave turnover rates of 159, 20, and 3 μM/h, respectively. [2 - 14 C]propionate and [U- 14 C]lactate were metabolized to [14 C]acetate, 14 CO 2, and 14 CH 4. [14 C]formate was completely converted to 14 CO 2 in less than 1 min. Inhibition of methanogenesis with chloroform resulted in an immediate accumulation of volatile fatty acids and hydrogen. Hydrogen inhibited the metabolism of C 3 -C 5 volatile fatty acids. The rates of fatty acid production were estimated from the rates of fatty acid accumulation {{in the presence of}} chloroform or hydrogen. The mean molar rates of production were acetate, 82 %; propionate, 13 %; butyrates, 2 %; and <b>valerates,</b> 3 %. A working model for carbon and electron flow is presented which illustrates that fermentation and methanogenesis are the predominate steps in carbon flow {{and that there is a}} close interaction between fermentative bacteria, acetogenic hydrogen-producing bacteria, and methanogens...|$|R

50|$|Estradiol cypionate and {{estradiol}} <b>valerate</b> {{are both}} C17β esters of estradiol. The affinity of estradiol <b>valerate</b> for the estrogen receptor {{has been reported}} to be 50 times less than that of estradiol, and estradiol <b>valerate</b> and estradiol cypionate have been found to possess similar affinity for the estrogen receptor. Both estradiol cypionate and estradiol <b>valerate</b> are rapidly cleaved into estradiol in the body, and estradiol <b>valerate</b> {{has been found to be}} unable to reach target tissues in any concentration of significance. As such, estradiol <b>valerate</b> is regarded as essentially inactive in terms of estrogenic effect itself, acting solely as a prodrug to estradiol, and estradiol cypionate is described as a prodrug of estradiol similarly.|$|E
50|$|Androstanolone <b>valerate</b> (brand name Apeton), {{also known}} as stanolone <b>valerate</b> or {{dihydrotestosterone}} <b>valerate,</b> as well as 5α-androstan-17β-3-one 17-valerate, is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and a dihydrotestosterone ester. It is used as an injectable and acts as a prodrug of dihydrotestosterone.|$|E
50|$|A <b>valerate</b> {{compound}} is a salt or ester of valeric acid. It is {{also known}} as pentanoate. The <b>valerate</b> ion is C4H9COO&minus; (valeric acid minus one hydrogen ion).|$|E
5000|$|The {{esterification}} of the C17β {{position of}} estradiol as in estradiol <b>valerate</b> prevents the metabolism of estradiol <b>valerate</b> by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD). As approximately 80% of estradiol is metabolized into estrone (and estrone sulfate) by 17β-HSD during first-pass metabolism, this improves the metabolic stability and hence bioavailability of estradiol <b>valerate.</b> However, estradiol <b>valerate</b> is hydrolyzed into estradiol and valeric acid in the intestines, and hence, is still subject to extensive (albeit comparatively reduced) first-pass metabolism. As such, the oral bioavailability of estradiol <b>valerate</b> is only around 3 to 5%, and {{is comparable to}} that of micronized estradiol (which has similarly improved bioavailability relative to (non-micronized) oral estradiol). Due to its nature as a rapidly converted prodrug of estradiol, the pharmacokinetics of estradiol <b>valerate</b> {{are similar to those of}} micronized estradiol. Moreover, the pharmacodynamics and potency (after differences in molecular weight are taken into account) of oral estradiol <b>valerate</b> are considered to be equivalent to those of micronized estradiol. This is also notably true for effects on hepatic protein synthesis (e.g., of [...] ), again after differences in molecular weight between the two drugs are considered.|$|E
50|$|Estradiol <b>valerate</b> is an estrane (C18) steroid and the C17β <b>valerate</b> (or pentanoate) {{fatty acid}} ester of {{estradiol}}. It {{is also known}} as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol 17β-pentanoate. Other common esters of estradiol in use include estradiol cypionate, estradiol enanthate, and estradiol acetate, the former two of which are C17β esters of estradiol similarly to estradiol <b>valerate</b> and the latter of which is the C3 acetate ester of estradiol.|$|E
50|$|The {{affinity}} of estradiol <b>valerate</b> (before cleavage) for the estrogen receptor {{is approximately}} 50 times {{lower than that}} of estradiol (after cleavage). In addition, estradiol <b>valerate</b> (before cleavage) is unable to reach target tissues in any concentration of significance, if at all. As such, estradiol <b>valerate</b> (before cleavage) is essentially inactive in terms of estrogenic effect itself, acting solely as a prodrug to estradiol (after cleavage).|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to oral administration, the bioavailability of estradiol <b>valerate</b> {{has been found}} to be complete (i.e., 100%) via intramuscular injection. Due to the far greater bioavailability of intramuscular estradiol <b>valerate</b> relative to oral, the former is substantially stronger (in terms of potency) than the latter. As an example, a single 4 mg intramuscular injection is said to be approximately equivalent to 2 mg/day of the drug administered orally over the course of 3 weeks. Estradiol <b>valerate,</b> when given intramuscularly in oil, has a relatively long duration due to the formation of an intramuscular depot from which the drug is slowly released and absorbed. Upon intramuscular injection of estradiol <b>valerate</b> in an oil solution, the solvent (i.e., oil) is absorbed, and a primary microcrystalline depot is formed within the muscle at the site of injection. In addition, a secondary depot may also be formed in adipose tissue. The slow release of estradiol <b>valerate</b> is caused by the increased lipophilicity of the drug, which in turn is due to its long fatty acid valeric acid ester moiety. The terminal half-life of intramuscularly administered estradiol <b>valerate</b> in oil is reported to be 4 to 5 days.|$|E

50|$|A single {{intramuscular}} injection of 4 mg estradiol <b>valerate</b> {{has been found}} to result in maximal circulating levels of estradiol of about 390 pg/mL within 3 days of administration, with levels declining to 100 pg/mL (baseline, in the study) by 12-13 days. Another study found that a single {{intramuscular injection}} of 5 mg estradiol <b>valerate</b> resulted in peak circulating levels of 667 pg/mL estradiol and 324 pg/mL estrone within approximately 2 and 3 days, respectively (see right/above table). The duration of estradiol <b>valerate</b> at this dose and in this study was considered to be 7 to 8 days. Other studies have found that larger doses of intramuscular estradiol <b>valerate</b> exceeding 20 mg have a duration of more than 15 days. A third study, in contrast to the preceding study, found that a single 10 mg intramuscular injection of estradiol <b>valerate</b> resulted in maximal estradiol levels of 506-544 pg/mL and maximal estrone levels of 205-219 pg/mL in postmenopausal women.|$|E
