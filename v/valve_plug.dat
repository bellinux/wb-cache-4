40|$|A {{fast-acting}} valve {{includes an}} annular valve seat that defines an annular valve orifice between {{the edges of}} the annular valve seat, an annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> sized to cover the valve orifice when the valve is closed, and a valve-plug holder for moving the annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> on and off the annular valve seat. The use of an annular orifice reduces the characteristic distance between {{the edges of the}} valve seat. Rather than this distance being equal to the diameter of the orifice, as it is for a conventional circular orifice, the characteristic distance equals the distance between the inner and outer radii (for a circular annulus). The reduced characteristic distance greatly reduces the gap required between the annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> and the annular valve seat for the valve to be fully open, thereby greatly reducing the required stroke and corresponding speed and acceleration of the annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug.</b> The use of a valve-plug holder that is under independent control to move the annular <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> between its open and closed positions is important for achieving controllable fast operation of the valve...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is {{numerical}} simulation of some special cases of compressible fluid flow. The numerical methods for the fluid flow simulations, available turbulence models and special methods used for solution of problems with moving and dynamic computational meshes are shortly described. There are several specific models and computed results presented: two models with moving bodies, transonic fluid flows in blade cascades with rotor-stator interaction and flow in Roots blower are demonstrated. The results show the influence of moving bodies on the flow field. Several different 2 D axisymmetric and 3 D models of control valves for steam turbines together with used computational methods and obtained results are presented. The simulations were used for improvement of the control valve design; the results supported {{the reduction of the}} pressure pulsations and vibrations of the piping system on the Temelin nuclear power plant. The original <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> design was replaced with a new one with flat bottom. To illustrate the problem width also some computed results of the flow field for a combined valve are depicted. To verify the numerical simulations the 2 D computed results are compared with experimental results obtained on models with prismatic plugs.

Besides of these verifications also another comparison of computed flow field and pressure pulsations for rigid plug is mentioned.

40|$|Globe valves {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} types of valve used for {{throttling}} applications for all sizes due to better controllability and wider range. One of the major limitations associated with the use globe valves in liquid application is cavitation and it takes place both in part open and in fully open conditions due to varied reasons. There are different designs of globe valves available but for control valve applications, cage and plug designs are widely employed. Cage and plug design consists of body, valve cage, plug and an actuating mechanism. Actuating mechanism is connected to the <b>valve</b> <b>plug</b> which is a moving part, through valve shaft. There are many investigations reported about the flow visualization and numerical simulation of normal type globe valves. But study on valves with cage and plug design are not reported in detail. The objective of the present study is to provide a three dimensional analysis of flow through a globe valve with cage and plug design with emphasis on the inception and development of cavitation in detail. Cavitation reduction is achieved by breaking the flow in the form of more than one liquid jet, thereby increasing the turbulence inside the valve flow path. The numerical simulation was done using GAMBIT to set up geometry and grid and FLUENT to solve difference equation postulated from the conservation of mass and momentum of the fluid in motion. The k-epsilon model was used for turbulence. Results of five configurations of the cage with constant flow areas and valve stroke are presented in this paper. The numerical results were verified with an experimental program employing total flow measurement and pressure drop created by the valve at full opening. The study was conducted for different jet configurations to generalize the results of the study. Experimental validation was done in the water test facility with an operating pressure of 1. 6 MPa and flow rate of 0. 05 m 3 /s. In the study, total area of opening for the flow and the valve stroke were kept constant. Accelerometers and dynamic pressure sensors were employed to sense the severity of cavitation at different differential pressures across the test valve...|$|E

50|$|The closure {{member of}} the <b>valve,</b> <b>plugs</b> are {{connected}} to the stem which is slid or screwed up or down to throttle the flow. Plugs are typically of the balance or unbalanced type. Unbalanced plugs are solid and are used with smaller valves or with low pressure drops across the valve. The advantages are simpler design, with one possible leak path at the seat and usually lower cost. The disadvantages are the limited size; with a large unbalanced plug the forces needed to seat and hold the flow often becomes impractical. Balanced plugs have holes through the plug. Advantages include easier shut off as the plug does not have to overcome static forces. However, a second leak path is created between the plug and the cage, and cost is generally higher.|$|R
