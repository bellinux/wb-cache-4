40|$|The {{thoracic}} trauma index (TTI) and the <b>viscous</b> <b>criterion</b> (<b>VC)</b> are injury criteria {{intended for}} the prediction of torso injury severity. The criteria were assessed in two series of experiments: 90 ° (lateral) car to car collisions and controlled left trunk impacts against either a rigid or padded wall. Forty-two belt restrained human cadavers in the age range 18 – 65 years, located in the near-side front passenger seat, were used. The impact velocity was between 40 and 60 km/h. Left and right side impacts were simulated using standard or modified car side structures. With the second series of experiments, {{the left side of}} each subject was impacted under one of two different test conditions: 24 km/h rigid wall or 32 km/h padded wall. The thorax deformation was evaluated through the double integration of the accelerated difference at the fourth and eight ribs, near and far side. Deformation maxima of 6 – 138 mm (mean 69 mm), VC values of 0. 3 – 4. 7 m/s (mean 1. 6 m/s), and TTI values of 85 – 252 (mean 63) occurred. Torso abbreviated injury severity (AIS) values were between 0 and 5. Statistical analyses showed a stronger influence of age on injury severity than the injury criteria or biomechanical responses in the two series of experiments. The TTI showed the highest correlation with thoracic AIS and the number of rib fractures, while VC was the better predictor of abdominal AIS.

40|$|The present work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} injuries following car-to-car side collisions. The injuries {{in this type of}} impact have been evaluated to form the basis for the development of test methods and for the principles of protective systems. Side impacts give rise to relatively more severe injuries than frontal impacts. The study has shown that the neck and the legs of the struck side occupant need to be better protected due to a high risk of permanent disabilities. The head, chest and abdomen/pelvis need to be better protected from a risk of life-threatening injuries. It has also been found that chest injuries increase significantly with age. Improved protection in side impacts can be achieved with car body/door reinforcements and compliant bolstering (padding and/or airbag) {{on the inside of the}} door. In order to develop and evaluate the principles of such protective systems a subsystem sled test method that simulates full-scale test conditions has been developed. The BioSid dummy was used. The use of a chest airbag (8 litre and unventilated) resulted in significantly lower loadings to the chest compared to (50 mm thick) compliant chest padding of polyethylene foam type, and significantly lower loadings to the head, neck and abdomen than a stiff reference door. Pelvis padding (75 mm thick) of the same material effectively reduced the pelvic loads. Both the acceleration based chest injury criterion TTI and the deformation based criterion VC were considerably reduced compared to a stiff door. The head ejection through the side window frame was reduced by an average of 30 mm. To further enhance the protection level, the airbag was increased to 12 litres in volume to cover both the chest and the abdomen down to the door armrest level. The effect of bag pressure and bag ventilation was investigated at two side impact severities. The ventilation of the bag reduced the maximum chest deflection by 30 % and the maximum chest <b>viscous</b> <b>criterion,</b> <b>VC,</b> by 50 % (comparison was made with the same bag without ventilation). A suitable initial bag (over) pressure was found to be about 40 kPa, when the loading of the abdomen was also taken into consideration. The deflection based criteria were found to be very sensitive to the door velocity. The stiffness of the bag corresponds to the tolerance level of the thorax of elderly people. The 12 litre ventilated side airbag resulted in 30 - 40 % lower chest deflection and about 60 % lower VC than 50 mm of another compliant chest padding material (Ethafoam 220 of polyethylene foam). TTI was 30 - 45 % lower. The findings from the evaluation of the airbag (size, initial pressure, ventilation) are also applicable to seat mounted side airbags of the type Autoliv has developed together with Volvo. To further improve the protection of the head/neck in side impacts a supplementary protective device "the curtain" at the side window has been proposed. In an investigation carried out together with the Birmingham University it was found that the optimum location for a side airbag sensor is the rear lower quadrant of the front door. A sensor located in this sector would cover almost 90 % of the impacts with risk of AIS 3 + injuries. A pendulum subsystem test method for the evaluation of sensors for side airbags has been developed and validated against low speed full-scale tests. The method has been used for evaluation of a pyrotechnical sensor. The sensor fires at impact speeds above 15 - 20 km/h, when there is a risk of life threatening (AIS 3 +) injuries to struck side occupants and not at low impact speeds (7 km/h), when the risk of injury is minimal. The principle finding in the study was that protective systems in side impacts must be softer than the corresponding human body segments. This was best accomplished with a ventilated side airbag for the chest and the abdomen (down to the armrest level) and padding for the pelvis and the leg. The proposed "curtain" will further enhance the head/neck protection...|$|E

40|$|Although {{there have}} been {{tremendous}} improvements in crash safety {{there has been an}} increasing trend in side impact fatalities, rising from 30 % to 37 % of total fatalities from 1975 to 2004 (NHTSA, 2004). Between 1979 and 2004, 63 % of AIS≥ 4 injuries in side impact resulted from thoracic trauma (NHTSA, 2004). Lateral impact fatalities, although decreasing in absolute numbers, now comprise a larger percentage of total fatalities. Safety features are typically more effective in frontal collisions compared to side impact due to the reduced distance between the occupant and intruding vehicle in side impact collisions. Therefore, an increased understanding of the mechanisms governing side impact injury is necessary in order to improve occupant safety in side impact auto crash. This study builds on an advanced numerical human body model with focus on a detailed thoracic model, which has been validated using available post mortem human subject (PMHS) test data for pendulum and side sled impact tests (Forbes, 2005). Crash conditions were investigated through use of a modified side sled model used to reproduce the key conditions present in full scale crash tests. The model accounts for several important factors that contribute to occupant response based on the literature. These factors are; the relative velocities between the seat and door, the occupant to door distance, the door shape and compliance. The side sled model was validated by reproducing the crash conditions present in FMVSS 214 and IIHS side impact tests and comparing the thoracic compression, velocity, and <b>Viscous</b> <b>Criterion</b> (<b>VC)</b> response determined by the model to the response of the ES- 2 dummy used in the crash tests. Injury was predicted by evaluating VCmax, selected for its ability to predict rate-sensitive soft tissue injury during thoracic compression (Lau & Viano, 1986). The Ford Taurus FMVSS 214 and Nissan Maxima IIHS tests were selected from side impact crash test data found in the NHTSA database because they included factors not present in standard side impact test procedures. These factors were; the presence of door accelerometers used to provide input velocities to the side impact model and the use of a ES- 2 (rather than the SID) to facilitate comparison of VC response to the human body model. Also, the two crash test procedures (FMVSS 214 & IIHS) were selected to ensure accurate side impact model response to different impact scenarios. The side impact model was shown to closely reproduce the timing and injury response of the full-scale FMVSS 214 side impact test of a Ford Taurus, as well as the IIHS side impact test of a Nissan Maxima. The side impact model was then used to investigate the effects of door to occupant spacing, door velocity profile, armrest height, seat foam, restraint system, and arm position. It was found that the VCmax was controlled by both the first and second peaks typically found in door velocity profiles, but the effect of each varies depending on the situation. This study found that VCmax was reduced by 73 - 88 % when door intrusion was eliminated compared to the VC response incurred by an intruding door. Also, the presence of a deformable door based on physical geometry and material characteristics rather than a simplified rigid door reduced VCmax by 16 % in this study. The study on seat foam determined that significant effects on VC response can be made by modest adjustments in foam properties. Low stiffness seat foam was found to increase VCmax by 41 % when compared to the VC response when using high stiffness foam. Arm position has been proven to be a relevant factor in side impact crash. Positioning the arms parallel to the thorax, in the “down” position, caused a 42 % increase in VCmax when compared to the VC response determined with the arms positioned at 45 degrees. Finally, although restraint systems have limited influence on side impact crash safety compared to front and rear impacts, this study found that the presence of a pre-tensioning restraint system reduced VCmax by 13 % when compared to the VC response of an un-belted occupant. It {{should be noted that the}} current study was limited to velocity profiles obtained from a specific FMVSS 214 test and therefore results and observations are restricted to the confines of the input conditions used. However, the side impact model developed is a useful tool for evaluating factors influencing side impact and can be used to determine occupant response in any side impact crash scenario when the appropriate input conditions are provided...|$|E
40|$|Deformation {{of brain}} tissue in {{response}} to mechanical loading of the head is the root-cause of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Even below ultimate failure limits, deformation activates pathophysiological cascades resulting in delayed cell death. Injury response of soft tissues, such as the chest and spinal cord, {{is dependent on the}} product of deformation and velocity, a parameter termed the <b>viscous</b> <b>criterion.</b> We set out to test if hippocampal cell death could be predicted by a similar combination of strain and strain rate and if the <b>viscous</b> <b>criterion</b> was valid for hippocampus. Quantitative prediction of the brain's biological response to mechanical stimuli is difficult to achieve in animal models of TBI, so we utilized an in vitro model of TBI based on hippocampal slice cultures. We quantified the temporal development of cell death after precisely controlled deformations for 30 combinations of strain (0. 05 - 0. 50) and strain rate (0. 1 - 50 s(- 1)) relevant to TBI. Loading conditions for a subset of cultures were verified by analysis of highspeed video. Cell death was found to be significantly dependent on time-post injury, on strain magnitude, and to a lesser extent, on anatomical region by a repeated-measures, three-way ANOVA. The responses of the CA 1 and CA 3 regions of the hippocampus were not statistically different in contrast to some in vivo TBI studies. Surprisingly, cell death was not dependent on strain rate leading us to conclude that the <b>viscous</b> <b>criterion</b> is not a valid predictor for hippocampal tissue injury. Given the large data set and extensive combinations of biomechanical parameters, predictive mathematical functions relating independent variables (strain, region, and time post-injury) to the resultant cell death were defined. These functions can be used as tolerance criteria to equip finite element models of TBI with the added capability to predict biological consequences...|$|R

Methods: Twenty-six children aged 45 days to 7 years (14 girls and 12 boys) took part in this study. The forces applied by the physiotherapist were recorded using a orce-plate embedded in the manipulation table supporting the child. Two synchronized cameras filmed the scene in a calibrated environment. The displacement of reflective targets glued on the physiotherapist's hands was calculated using an automatic tracking procedure and the 3 D reconstruction "Direct Linear Transformation" algorithm. The progression of physical parameters was evaluated according to the age of the child. They included force, displacement, normalized displacement, loading speed, displacement and normalized displacement at the maximum force, force at the maximum displacement, <b>viscous</b> <b>criterion</b> and effective stiffness. Findings: For all patients, the mean maximum displacement and load were 22 mm (SD 9 mm) and 240 N (SD 46 N) respectively.

This paper analyses the validity of venture evaluation model in India by directly comparing the relative importance of evaluation criteria on the funding decision with the relative importance to factors influencing venture's empirical performance. In the light of the differences in investment opportunities around India, and the nature of industrial development in South East Asia in general, the author anticipated that the investment criteria employed by Venture Capital Firms (VCs) in India would differ. A questionnaire was administered to venture capitalists (regular members of Indian Venture Capital Association) to determine the criteria they use to decide on funding new ventures. The response rate was 100 %. A list of forty two criteria was developed on previously developed lists. The criteria fell into six groups: the entrepreneur’s personality, the entrepreneur’s experience, characteristics of the product or service, characteristics of the market, financial consideration and characteristics of venture management team. Answers were given on a four point rating scales. The results reveal that criteria adopted by Indian VCs are different from those adopted by VCs in other countries including US.

The focus {{of this study was to}} develop a numerical model to predict lung response and injury in side impact car crash scenarios. A biofidelic human body model was further developed. The geometry, material properties and boundary condition of the organs and soft tissues within the thorax were improved with the intent to ensure stress transmission continuity and model accuracy. The thoracic region of the human body model was revalidated against three pendulum and two sled impact scenarios at different velocities. Other body regions such as the shoulder, abdomen, and pelvis were revalidated. The latest model demonstrated improvements in every response category relative to the previous version of the human body model. The development of the lung model involved advancements in the material properties, and boundary conditions. An analytical approach was presented to correct the lung properties to the in-situ condition. Several injury metric predictor candidates of pulmonary contusion were investigated and compared based on the validated pendulum and sled impact scenarios. The results of this study confirmed the importance of stress wave focusing, reflection, and concentration within the lungs. The bulk modulus of the lung had considerable influence on injury metric outcomes. Despite the <b>viscous</b> <b>criterion</b> yielded similar response for different loading conditions, this study demonstrated that the level of contusion volume varied with the size of the impact surface area. In conclusion, the human body model could be used for the analysis of thoracic response in automotive impact scenarios. The overall model is capable of predicting thoracic response and lung contusion. Future development on the heart and aorta can expand the model capacity to investigate all vital organ injury mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{blast wave}} emanating from an {{explosion}} produces an almost instantaneous rise in pressure which can then cause Blast Overpressure (BOP) injuries to nearby persons. BOP injury criteria are specified in test standards to relate BOP measurements in a testing environment to {{a risk of}} BOP injury. This study considered the adequacy of test standards in evaluating BOP protection concepts for the torso. Four potential BOP injury scenarios were studied to determine the likelihood of injury and the adequacy of test standards for appropriate protection concepts. In the case of vehicle blast, BOP injury is unlikely and test standards are adequate. In the scenario involving an explosive charge detonated within a vehicle, and the close proximity to a hand grenade scenario, test standards are not available. The demining scenario was identified as of importance as test standards are available, but do not mandate the evaluation of BOP protection. A prototype South African Torso Surrogate (SATS) was developed to explore this scenario further. The SATS was required to be relatively inexpensive and robust. The SATS was cast from silicone (selected to represent body tissue characteristics) using a torso mould containing a steel frame and instrumented with chest face-on pressure transducer and accelerometer. The SATS was subjected to an Anti-Personnel (AP) mine test and the Chest Wall Velocity Predictor and <b>Viscous</b> <b>Criterion</b> were used to predict that BOP injuries would occur in a typical demining scenario. This result was confirmed by applying the injury criteria to empirical blast predictions from the Blast Effects Calculator Version 4 (BECV 4). Although limitations exist {{in the ability of}} injury criteria and measurement methods to accurately predict BOP injuries, generally a conservative approach should be taken. Thus, it is recommended that the risk of BOP injuries should be evaluated in demining personal protective equipment test standards...|$|R
40|$|Side impact {{motor vehicle}} crashes pose unique {{challenges}} for occupant protection, {{particularly with regard}} to torso injury mitigation. The minimal crush distance between the vehicle exterior and the occupant torso has necessitated advanced passive safety technologies in response to tightened regulatory requirements and increased public awareness of safety issues. In particular, lateral airbag restraints (side airbags) have undergone a rapid and unregulated introduction in recent years, with US availability increasing to over 90 % of new vehicles in 2010. As with frontal airbag restraints, the prdissertationsity for injury to occupants in close proximity to side airbag deployment remains a concern. Test protocols have been proposed to evaluate occupant injury risk from airbag deployment with mechanical occupant surrogates. Yet few studies have attempted to characterize thoracoabdominal responses to close-proximity airbag contact in actual crashes, leaving unaddressed the relevance of test protocols and occupant surrogates currently employed. To address this issue, the present study sought to identify and characterize injury and biomechanical responses of the thoracoabdominal region to torso-interacting side airbag restraints. A novel biological experimental approach was developed from a multi-body analysis and from an evaluation of documented restraint performance. Biomechanical responses of deflection, deflection rate, the <b>Viscous</b> <b>Criterion,</b> and deformation obliquity with respect to subject anatomy were quantified. Further, tissue-level material response was examined through a comparative finite element analysis of subject-specific loading. Results indicated that traumatic visceral injury specific to the posterolateral region was associated with close-proximity airbag interaction. Deformation response was uniquely oblique with respect to anatomy, necessitating the refinement of existing injury metrics. Biomechanical tolerances were also determined for risk of trauma to posterolateral viscera. These results are useful for the development of mechanical occupant surrogates and reductions to injury risks from close-proximity side airbag loading...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringSignificant advancements in {{enhancing}} passenger safety and vehicle structures {{have been made}} in the automotive industry to protect the occupants and to minimize the injuries during crash events. Variety of crash tests, based on federal regulatory standards, have been performed with an end goal to examine the occupant kinematics and potential injury responses. Among different automotive crash scenarios, the frontal impact is the most common type of accident, which has been considered in this study. In recent years, computer-aided engineering tools have been extensively utilized in modeling, analysis and design of vehicle structures and occupant safety systems. The primary reason for the development and use of simulation models is to reduce the number of full-scale sled tests performed, which require vast flow time and are associated with significant cost. This thesis entirely focuses on the comparison of dynamic responses of human body models versus the crash dummy models in various vehicle frontal federal regulatory standards. For this reason, a ford taurus car representing a typical sedan has been considered as a medium. The simulation tests are conducted for the full frontal impact, small offset overlap impact and oblique impact configurations. A car interior environment is developed in MADYMO code, in which the human and dummy models are placed in. The acceleration acquired from the finite element analysis of frontal crash scenarios and the driver seat node are then input into the MADYMO code for both human and dummy models, and their kinematic responses are then compared. Per regulations, chest injury is considered to be a prominent factor in frontal crashes. Hence, the variations of chest deflection, chest acceleration and <b>viscous</b> <b>criteria</b> are investigated. The results from this study illustrate the potential difference between the human and dummy dynamic performances in various frontal crash scenarios. In particular, the differences in chest acceleration, chest deflection, and flexibility of spine are quantified...|$|R

We use the <b>viscous</b> profile <b>criterion</b> for shock admissibility. This criterion {{leads to the}} occurrence of non-classical transitional shock waves, which are sensitively dependent on {{the form of the}} viscosity matrix. The goal {{of this paper is to}} lay a foundation for investigating how the structure of solutions of the Riemann problem is affected by the choice of viscosity matrix. Working in the framework of the fundamental wave manifold, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition on the model parameters for the presence of transitional shock waves. Using this condition, we are able to identify the regions in the wave manifold that correspond to transitional shock waves. Also, we determine the boundaries in the space of model parameters that separate models with differing numbers of transitional regions...|$|R
40|$|The {{flow field}} of a vortex in a viscous shear flow is found by {{constructing}} a uniformly valid asymptotic expansion consisting of an inner solution field represented, to lowest order, by a two dimensional, nonliner, inviscid Stuart vortex and an outer solution field represented, to lowest order, by either a two dimensional parallel or self similar viscous flow. The technique involves scaling both the transverse and streamwise coordinates {{in the vicinity}} of the vortex as well as allowing for a slow variation of the outer <b>viscous</b> flow. <b>Criteria</b> are established for both the size of the vortical structure and proximity to the boundary surfaces. The composite solution is a consistent mathematical picture of the flow field at a fixed streamwise location as the vortical structure evolves past this point. Such a formulation is also useful in the specification of boundary or initial conditions in numerical fluid dynamic calculations, where an inconsistent setting of these conditions leads to spurious results for rather long computation times...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a one-parameter family of nonstrictly hyperbolic systems of conservation laws modeling three-phase flow in a porous medium. For a particular {{value of the}} parameter, the model has a shock wave solution that undergoes several bifurcations upon perturbation of its left and right states and the parameter. In this paper we use singularity theory and bifurcation theory of dynamical systems, including Melnikov's method, to find all nearby shock waves that are admissible according to the <b>viscous</b> profile <b>criterion.</b> We use these results to construct a unique solution of the Riemann problem for each left and right state and parameter value in a neighborhood of the unperturbed shock wave solution; together with previous numerical work, this construction completes {{the solution of the}} three-phase flow model. In the bifurcation analysis, the unperturbed shock wave acts as an organizing center for the waves appearing in Riemann solutions. 1. Introduction Existence, uniqueness, and well- [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{numerical}} method, {{based on the}} Dafermos regularization, for computing a one-parameter family of Riemann solutions {{of a system of}} conservation laws. The family is obtained by varying either the left or right state of the Riemann problem. The Riemann solutions are required to have shock waves that satisfy the <b>viscous</b> profile <b>criterion</b> prescribed by the physical model. The system is not required to satisfy strict hyperbolicity or genuine nonlinearity; the left and right states need not be close; and the Riemann solutions may contain an arbitrary number of waves, including composite waves and nonclassical shock waves. The method uses standard continuation software to solve a boundary-value problem in which the left and right states of the Riemann problem appear as parameters. Because the continuation method can proceed around limit point bifurcations, it can sucessfully compute multiple solutions of a particular Riemann problem, including ones that correspond to unstable asymptotic states of the viscous conservation laws. 1.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effects by crash related car parameters on head and chest injury measures for 3 - and 12 -year-old children in near side impacts. Methods: The evaluation was made by using a model of a complete passenger car which was impacted laterally by a barrier. The car model was validated in two crash conditions: the IIHS and the USNCAP side impact tests. The SID-IIs and the HBM 3 (THUMS 3 -yo) finite element models were used for the parametric investigation (HBM 3 on a booster). The car parameters were: vehicle mass, side impact structure stiffness, a head airbag, a thorax-pelvis airbag, and a seat belt with pretensioner. The studied dependent variables were: resultant head linear acceleration, resultant head rotational acceleration, chest <b>viscous</b> <b>criterion,</b> rib deflection, and relative velocity at head impact. The chest measurements were only considered for the SID-IIs. Results: The head airbag had the greatest effect on the head measurements for both of the occupant models. On average, it reduced the peak head linear acceleration by 54 g for the HBM 3 and 78 g for the SID-IIs. The seat belt had the second greatest effect on the head measurements; the peak head linear accelerations were reduced on average by 39 g (HBM 3) and 44 g (SID-IIs). The high stiffness side structure increased the SID-IIs head acceleration, while it had marginal effect on the HBM 3. The vehicle mass had marginal effect on SID-IIs head accelerations, while the lower vehicle mass caused 18 g higher head acceleration for HBM 3 and the greatest rotational acceleration. The thorax-pelvis airbag, the vehicle mass and the seat belt pretensioner affected the chest measurements the most. The presence of a thorax-pelvis airbag, high vehicle mass and a seat belt pretensioner all reduced the chest VC and peak rib deflection in the SID-IIs. Conclusions: The head and thorax-pelvis airbags have the potential to reduce injury measurements for both the SID-IIs and the HBM 3, provided that the airbag properties are designed to consider these occupant sizes also. The seat belt pretensioner is also effective, provided that the lateral translation of the torso is managed by other features. The importance of lateral movement management is greater the smaller the occupant is. Light vehicles require interior restraint systems of higher performance than heavy vehicles do to achieve the same level of injury measures for a given side structure...|$|R
