50|$|The Visiting Forces Act 1952 {{was passed}} to {{incorporate}} {{the provisions of the}} NATO Status of Forces Agreement into United Kingdom law. SOFA provides a basis for a mutual and reciprocal system of exemptions, immunities and privileges for visiting forces when exercising or stationed in a host country. A major feature of SOFA, which is implemented by the 1952 Act, is the question of jurisdiction for dealing with offences committed by <b>visiting</b> <b>service</b> men, civil servants accompanying a force, dependents and contractors. Its main provision is the agreement that the visiting force will retain jurisdiction for its people, which applies equally to United States personnel based in the United Kingdom and British forces serving in NATO countries, Commonwealth countries and, more recently, those countries that have signed up to the NATO partnership for peace. Usually, the service authorities for the visiting force member alleged to have committed an offence and the United Kingdom authorities will be able to agree which jurisdiction is appropriate to deal with the case. If agreement is not reached the decision as to jurisdiction will be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service. Where United Kingdom jurisdiction is appropriate the visiting forces case will normally be dealt with locally unless other criteria require the case to be dealt with by Crown Prosecution Service headquarters. Section 1 of the Visiting Forces Act 1952 contains a list of countries to which the Act applies. Subsection 2 of Section 1, along with Subsection 2 of Section 15 provide the authority and a means for extending this list.Visiting Forces (Designation) Order 1997 and 1998 extended this list by designation additional countries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{a growing}} {{understanding}} {{of the effectiveness of}} bereavement interventions and the groups that benefit most from them, we know little about the cost-effectiveness of bereavement interventions. Methods We conducted a cost-utility analysis alongside a randomized clinical trial on a <b>visiting</b> <b>service</b> for older widowed individuals (n = 110) versus care as usual (CAU; n = 106). The <b>visiting</b> <b>service</b> is a selective bereavement intervention that offers social support to lonely widows and widowers by a trained volunteer. Participants were contacted 6 – 9 months post-loss. Eleven percent of all contacted persons responded and eight percent participated in the trial. The primary outcome measure was quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained (assessed with the EQ- 5 D), which is a generic measure of health status. Costs were calculated from a societal perspective excluding costs arising from productivity losses. Using the bootstrap method, we obtained the incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR), projected these on a cost-utility plane and presented as an acceptability curve. Results Overall, the experimental group demonstrated slightly better results against slightly higher costs. Whether the <b>visiting</b> <b>service</b> is acceptable depends on the willingness to pay: at a willingness to pay equal to zero per QALY gained, the <b>visiting</b> <b>service</b> has a probability of 31 % of being acceptable; beyond € 20, 000, the <b>visiting</b> <b>service</b> has a probability of 70 % of being more acceptable than CAU. Conclusion Selective bereavement interventions like the <b>visiting</b> <b>service</b> will not produce large benefits from the health economic point of view, when targeted towards the entire population of all widowed individuals. We recommend that in depth analyses are conducted to identify who benefits most from this kind of interventions, and in what subgroups the incremental cost-utility is best.

Home care programs as hospital services supplement, not only can prevent elderly from get worse in their disabilities but also {{make it easier for}} governments to manage elderly people's needs therefore, we aimed to determine the home <b>visit</b> <b>services</b> provided for elderly residing in Isfahan province, Iran.   Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 elderly persons aged 60 years and above who were randomly selected from the list of the aged people which took services from seven home <b>visit</b> <b>service</b> centers. Data were analyzed through descriptive statistics.  Results: Mean± standard deviation age of the participants was 76 ± 8. 8 years and about 70 % were illiterate. Only about 56 % of included participants were able to care themselves. A large number (56. 3 %) of participants' income source was personal and 5. 7 % were did not have any insurance at all. The costs of 93. 5 % of services were provided by the Welfare Organization. The services provided at these centers include general physician visits, nursing cares, physiotherapy and occupational therapy services, psychologist and social worker visits.   Conclusion: As the home <b>visit</b> <b>services</b> might be effective for providing health care for the aged people and increasing their quality of life, policymaking to spread these services seems to be crucial especially for Iran...|$|R

This paper reports on a user-led UK wide survey of mothers' views about sources of support and experiences accessing the health <b>visiting</b> <b>service.</b> Netmums, a family of websites run by local mothers, undertook the survey following concerns that the health <b>visiting</b> <b>service</b> was proving increasingly difficult to access. 4, 665 mothers responded to questions about a) who they would seek help from, b) views of the local health <b>visiting</b> <b>service</b> and c) perceived change in it over the past two years. The results show that the majority of respondents rate their service as quite or very good, valuing most the characteristics of a) expertise in child health development and parenting and b) time and willingness to listen on the part of health visitors. In all areas but one, the service was seen as changing for the worse. Following the re-affirmation of a need for a universal health <b>visiting</b> <b>service</b> to be able to pick up families in need, the challenge is now to design local services that have sufficient resources so that mothers can maintain relationships and confidently access the services when they need them...|$|E
