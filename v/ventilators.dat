5|$|Portable <b>ventilators</b> may be {{required}} to support breathing. Historically, a noninvasive, negative-pressure ventilator, more commonly called an iron lung, was used to artificially maintain respiration during an acute polio infection until a person could breathe independently (generally about one to two weeks). Today, many polio survivors with permanent respiratory paralysis use modern jacket-type negative-pressure <b>ventilators</b> worn over the chest and abdomen.|$|E
5|$|At {{the second}} board, expert {{witnesses}} suggested {{that what was}} observed was the venting, through the engine-room <b>ventilators,</b> of a violent—but not instantaneous—explosion or deflagration in the 4-inch magazines. The same deflagration would have collapsed the bulkhead separating the 4-inch and 15-inch magazines, resulting very quickly in a catastrophic explosion similar to those previously witnessed at Jutland. This theory was ultimately adopted by the board.|$|E

Methods: Serum albumin and prealbumin of 44 COPD patients using breathing machine> 48 h were tested at admission, 1 week, 2 weeks treatment. According to the existence of <b>ventilator</b> dependence, divided the patients into the <b>ventilator</b> dependence group and the <b>ventilator</b> independence group, compare the albumin, prealbumin average of two groups, evaluate {{the correlation between the}} serum albumin, prealbumin and <b>ventilator</b> dependence in patients with COPD. Results: Albumin levels reduced in both groups after 1 week treatment, but there was no statistically significant difference. Albumin levels reduced in both groups after 2 weeks treatment, but more significantly in the <b>ventilator</b> dependence group, the difference had statistical significance. Prealbumin levels in the <b>ventilator</b> independence group after 1 week treatment didn’t reduced, but reduced in the <b>ventilator</b> dependence group, the difference was statistically significant. Prealbumin levels reduced in both groups after 2 weeks treatment, but more significant in the <b>ventilator</b> dependence group, the difference had statistical significance. Conclusion: Serum albumin and prealbumin levels were correlation with the <b>ventilator</b> dependence in patients with COPD. But prealbumin can more sensitively and more early predict the <b>ventilator</b> dependence in patients with COPD suffered from malnutrition...|$|R

5|$|Adding to {{the chaos}} were {{fears of a}} {{potential}} second explosion. A cloud of steam shot out of <b>ventilators</b> at the ammunition magazine at Wellington Barracks as naval personnel extinguished a fire by the magazine. While the fire was quickly put out, the cloud was seen from blocks away and quickly led to rumours that another explosion was imminent. Uniformed officers ordered everyone away from the area. As the rumour spread across the city, many families fled their homes. The confusion hampered efforts for over two hours until fears were dispelled by about noon. However, many rescuers ignored the evacuation and naval rescue parties continued working uninterrupted at the harbour.|$|E

5|$|The {{garden was}} {{demolished}} in the 1960s, {{as was the}} golf house (in 1967). In the garden's location and replacing {{the use of the}} golf house, a wing was added to the clubhouse, constructed on the northeast terrace and completed in 1962. The building holds a pro shop, dining facilities, and locker rooms. The structure was designed to be spacious and convenient and not be noticeable from the grounds below, although from Woodlea, the sight of the tar roof and <b>ventilators</b> was noted to be worse than the prior standing gardens. The club hosted the NYNEX Commemorative from 1986 to 1993. In 1989, professional golfer Bob Charles set a current record when he won the tournament.

A smaller, cheaper riprap was completed by the end of 1935. A guard tower and a catwalk from Hill Tower was added to the roof of the Industries Building in June 1936 and the building was made secure with bars from old cells to bar the windows and grill the roof <b>ventilators</b> and to prevent inmates from escaping from the roof. It ceased use as a laundry in 1939 when it was moved to the upper floor of the New Industries Building.

5|$|Gaudí {{carried out}} a second {{commission}} from Eusebi Güell between 1884 and 1887, the Güell Pavilions in Pedralbes, now {{on the outskirts of}} Barcelona. Güell had a country residence in Les Corts de Sarrià, consisting of two adjacent properties known as Can Feliu and Can Cuyàs de la Riera. The architect Joan Martorell had built a Caribbean-style mansion, which was demolished in 1919 {{to make way for the}} Royal Palace of Pedralbes. Gaudí undertook to refurbish the house and construct a wall and porter's lodge. He completed the stone wall with several entrances, the main entrance with an iron gate in the shape of a dragon, with symbology allusive to the myths of Hercules and the Garden of the Hesperides. The buildings consist of a stable, covered longeing ring and porter's lodge: the stable has a rectangular base and catenary arches; the longeing ring has a square base with a hyperboloid dome; the porter's lodge consists of three small buildings, the central one being polygonal with a hyperbolic dome, and the other two smaller and cubic. All three are topped by <b>ventilators</b> in the shape of chimneys faced with ceramics. The walls are of exposed brick in various shades of reds and yellows; in certain sections prefabricated cement blocks are also used. The Pavilions are now the headquarters of the Real Cátedra Gaudí, of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the modern positive-pressure <b>ventilators</b> were based mainly on {{technical}} developments by the military during World War II to supply oxygen to fighter pilots in high altitude. Such <b>ventilators</b> replaced the iron lungs as safe endotracheal tubes with high-volume/low-pressure cuffs were developed. The popularity of positive-pressure <b>ventilators</b> rose during the polio epidemic in the 1950s in Scandinavia and the United States and {{was the beginning of}} modern ventilation therapy. Positive pressure through manual supply of 50% oxygen through a tracheostomy tube led to a reduced mortality rate among patients with polio and respiratory paralysis. However, because of the sheer amount of man-power required for such manual intervention, mechanical positive-pressure <b>ventilators</b> became increasingly popular.|$|E

25|$|The {{deterioration}} of wood occurred at typically vulnerable areas, {{such as the}} exposed end grain of arches and muntins and where wood members intersect. The humidity in the building was a contributing factor to wood deterioration. The level of moisture in the building was exacerbated by two conditions. First, the building’s natural ventilation system had been removed in a past repair. The <b>ventilators,</b> which were originally located in the low wall area, had been filled in, and some ridge <b>ventilators</b> were inoperable. The air flow through the <b>ventilators,</b> which would have assisted in the evaporation of water, was not occurring. Second, the penetration of rain water from {{the exterior of the}} building, because of inadequate or deteriorated waterproofing, had increased the level of moisture in the wood. The copper sheathing that had originally capped the arch exteriors, in addition to acting as a moisture barrier, may have been acting as a biocide through copper oxides inhibiting wood rot.|$|E
