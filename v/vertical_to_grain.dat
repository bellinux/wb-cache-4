This research aimed at quantifying effect of moisture content on physical and mechanical properties of juvenile rubberwood core. The specimens at various moisture contents were tested in compression and shear parallel <b>to</b> <b>grain.</b> Information was gathered to determine shrinkage, density and specific gravity of specimens. The equilibrium moisture content determined from desorption experiment, was well described by the Hailwood-Horrobin solution theory. Moisture content of 23 + 4 % best represented the value of apparent fiber saturation point, Mp, determined from physical and mechanical properties data. Above Mp, values of all physical and mechanical properties examined were fairly constant. Maximum volumetric shrinkage from moisture content above Mp to an oven-dry condition was 8. 2 + 1. 8 %. Specific gravity and density were 0. 55 + 0. 03 and 614 + 30 kg/m 3 at 12 % moisture content. Below Mp, ultimate compressive stress (UCS) parallel <b>to</b> <b>grain,</b> ultimate shear stress parallel <b>to</b> <b>grain,</b> modulus of elasticity (MOE) for compression parallel <b>to</b> <b>grain,</b> and shear modulus parallel <b>to</b> <b>grain</b> increased exponentially with decreasing moisture content.
