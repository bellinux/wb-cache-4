An appropriate {{change in the}} way basic parameters (replica number, packet size) are sent to zero or infinity allows a derivation of Ward–Takahashi (WT) identities. In particular, these identities ensure the existence to all orders of zero modes opening the way to a Lagrangean formulation of a “droplet-like ” theory for the Ising spin glass. Spin glass theory has presented so far the schizophrenic aspect of two conflicting approaches difficult to reconcile. The so-called mean-field like approach developed around Parisi [1]-[3] solution of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick [4] meanfield model uses standard field theory (mean-field, loops, renormalisation group [...] .) on a Lagrangean built with replicated fields. The alternative droplet-like theory of Fisher and Huse [5], and Bray and Moore [6], despite abundant results does not appeal to such a Lagrangean field theory starting point...|$|E
