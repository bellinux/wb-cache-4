The codes were printed in black on a dark brown paper sheet included in the game package to make photocopying more difficult. They consisted of Commodore 64 graphics characters, {{making it difficult for}} would-be software pirates to include them in a text file with a pirate copy. The codes {{do not have to be}} entered when flying into the US or when the player is at an airport in another country. If the player enters the wrong codes five times, Zak gets locked in the Kathmandu jail and his guard makes a lengthy anti-piracy speech. Nonetheless, pirated {{versions of the}} game quickly popped up anyway, in which the player may enter any code; modern-day cracked versions completely remove the need to enter exit <b>visa</b> <b>codes.</b> While copy protection codes were left out of the Commodore 64 version of Maniac Mansion for lack of disk space, the developers solved this problem in Zak McKracken by putting the game engine on a separate start-up floppy. This freed enough space to include the codes on the main disk. The Commodore version of Zak McKracken did not have CBM DOS files (only raw data), but was not protected and could be backed up.|$|R

As a result, many embark on hazardous journeys, with concomitant risks {{and loss of}} human life. The absence of ‘protection-sensitive’ mechanisms for accessing EU territory, along with EU external and extraterritorial border and migration management and control, undermine Member States' refugee and human rights obligations. Humanitarian visas may offer a remedy in this regard by enabling third-country nationals to apply in situ for entry to EU territory on humanitarian grounds or because of international obligations. This study asks whether the existing <b>Visa</b> <b>Code</b> actually obliges Member States to issue humanitarian visas.

40|$|First, X and X {{contributes}} to legal uncertainty {{as regards the}} applicability of the Charter to member states for the purposes of Article 51 (1) CFR. The judgment does not conform to the expansive and creative interpretation of Fransson; it contradicts the specific precedent regarding powers derived from EU Regulations established in N. S. and Others; and it does not fit satisfactorily within the Siragusa criteria which the CJEU in any case entirely omitted. Second, the Court, instead of giving an appropriate degree of weight to the formal connection of the visa application to EU law, which was confirmed by the legal practice of the parties to the dispute at national level, the CJEU engaged in a counter-intuitive teleological interpretation that disregarded the textual reading of the statute. Such contra legem failure to give effect to an applicable statute – which merely required the acknowledgement of the applicability of EU law, not the reversal of the visa refusal – is inimical to a conventional functioning of legal systems based on the rule of law, such as the legal order of the EU. Moreover, the teleological interpretation cannot be validated by reference to any of the values that the EU is based upon; nor can it be legitimatized by requirements of the Dublin Regulation establishing the common EU asylum system, as there is no legal hierarchy between that Regulation and the Regulation on the <b>Visa</b> <b>Code.</b> Third and last, the CJEU paid little attention to the potential effects on the unity, primacy and effectiveness of EU law when divergent national standards with respect to visa applications “formally” based on the <b>Visa</b> <b>Code</b> are developed.

Yet historical analysis reveals that immigration law has been put to uses far from idyllic, and has always been concerned with the racial makeup of the nation.

The continued national preference for White immigrants is explicitly featured in the <b>visa</b> profiling <b>codes</b> of U. S. embassies and consulates. This Essay employs a race-conscious lens to analyze the way in which immigration law has been structured to perpetuate a racial hierarchy which privileges Whiteness, primarily by preferring White immigrants to immigrants of color, and secondarily by drafting immigrants of color to form a middle-tier buffer and, alternatively, to provide a bottom-tier surplus labor supply...|$|R
40|$| removal in the {{foreseeable}} future. Accordingly, Mr Al Masri’s continued detention was held to be unlawful and Merkel J ordered his release from detention on 15 August. Two weeks later, the Minister secured permission for the entry of Mr Al Masri and other Palestinians to Gaza. Mr Al Masri was placed in detention pending his deportation {{and is no longer}} in the country. This case has the potential to affect the detention of all people waiting to be removed from Australia where there is no real likelihood of removal in {{the foreseeable}} future. Failed Iranian and Iraqi asylum seekers would fall into this category. In fact, just this week, Justice Mansfield ordered the release of a failed Iraqi asylum seeker - Mr Al Khafaji - on very similar grounds to Mr Al Masri. For this reason, the government has appealed the decision in Al Masri’s case - even though he is no longer in the country - and we are waiting for the decision of the Full Federal Court, which is expected to be handed down soon. (b) The Hazara Afghanis: The next series of unlawful detention cases that appeared in the Federal Court involved four Hazara Afghani asylum seekers whose applications were being processed around the time that the war against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan started. Unfortunately, we do not know the names of any of these applicants, due to changes to the Migration Act in 2001 prohibiting the courts from disclosing the name of applicants for protection <b>visas.</b> 6 <b>Codes</b> are used instead - hence ‘VFAD’ v Minister. We will refer to these four applicants as the Hazara Afghanis for now. Each applicant was an Hazara Afghani male who had arrived in Australia in early 2001. Through documents obtained by the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre under the Freedom of Information Act, the applicants discovered what appeared to be decisions signed by Immigration Department officials dating back to August 2001. They were decisions that appeared to grant them protection visas. However, these decisions were never communicated to the applicants and the Minister said that they were draft decisions only. After these ‘decisions’ appeared to have been made, the Minister for Immigration announced that given the changing situation in Afghanistan, there would be a department wide ‘freeze’ on the processing of all Afghani asylum applications until the situation had stabilised. Afghani asylum seekers were notified of this policy decision in mid-January this year, leading to protests at Woomera. Once processing recommenced {{after the fall of the}} Taliban, each of the applicants was denied a protection visa based on the changed circumstances in Afghanistan. The ultimate question in these cases is whether the ‘decisions’ were final decisions to grant protection visas to the applicants. If so, the processing freeze would have had no legal effect on them and the applicants should have been released from detention when the decisions were made. In each case, it was found that the applicants had a strong case for saying that the decisions were final decisions, and that they had been granted protection visas. This question will not, however, be determined until a final hearing takes place. The issue in these cases, though, was whether the applicants should be kept in detention until the final hearing. If the applicants succeed in proving that the decision records did constitute the grant of a visa, they will have been unlawfully detained since the decision was made. In reaching its decision in each case, the Court had to balance the strict requirements of the Migration Act with the law’s presumption in favour of liberty. The judges in each of these cases came down on the side of liberty. As Justice Gray put it: The protection of individual liberty is of such fundamental importance to the Australian legal system that the mere fact that the applicant is in detention must be given considerable weight. All four men were released into the care of a local charity, and are required to report to the Department on a regular basis until their hearings, which are scheduled early next year. (c) The ‘NAMU’ family: In many of these cases, evidence is led by the applicants of the detrimental effects of prolonged detention. About one of the Hazara Afghani applicants, Gray J said: He said he has been in detention for so long that he is now exhausted and depressed He feels as if his soul is not healthy and he is no longer human [...] . He feels like a fish that has just been caught, in its last moment before death. In another recent Federal Court case, it was argued that the effect of detention on children justified their release from detention. Applicant NAMU’s case (another pseudonym) was brought by a husband and wife and their four children, three of whom were under 18 years old. They are Iraqi nationals who fled in 1995 and arrived in Australia in 1999. They have been in detention since that time - about three years. The family claimed that their detention, although originally lawful, had become unlawful due to the severe psychological disturbances suffered by their children as a result of their detention. It was claimed that by placing the children in a situation where they had become suicidal the detention had stopped being administrative in nature and had become punitive. According to the reasoning in Lim’s case, punitive detention is unlawful. Justice Hely disagreed with this view on the basis that it is the purpose of detention, not its impact on individuals, that is the relevant question. He said that the purpose of detention remained valid - as the family was still pursuing visa applications, they were being detained for the purpose of being granted a visa. They have appealed his decision and are waiting in detention for the outcome of the appeal. As mentioned earlier, there is no restriction on the amount of time a person may be detained while waiting for a visa. As the processing freeze in relation to the Hazara Afghanis shows, there seems to be no obligation on the Minister to process applications within a fixed time frame. This is further highlighted by the case of the East Timorese asylum seekers in Australia - who arrived here eight years ago (and are not detained) - and who are only now having their protection applications processed. While the Minister for Immigration recently suggested that the asylum seekers themselves are in some way to blame for the delay in processing, the delay was in fact due solely to the Department’s reluctance to process asylum applications alleging persecution on the part of Indonesia, with whom Australia had a delicate political and diplomatic relationship. Most of these 1600 people had strong refugee claims at the time they lodged their applications; most are now being refused protection due to the changed political landscape in East Timor. Despite the devastating impact that such treatment has had on these people, who have had to try to establish new lives in a state of limbo, they are the lucky ones compared to the Hazara Afghanis who have been detained in the middle of the desert for up to three years, while the government plays political games with their lives. This, more than anything, perhaps reveals the true purpose of detention - the punishment of people for coming here in an ‘unorderly fashion’. As one commentator has put it, it is not the asylum seekers but Australian government that is seeking to achieve a migration outcome. The UK approach to detention - Saadi’s case NAMU’s case forms a stark contrast to the UK approach, as highlighted in Saadi’s case, decided in 2001. Saadi’s case challenged the UK policy of mandatory detention of all asylum seekers whose claims were, amongst other things, likely to be straightforward - that is, unfounded. Under that policy, a ‘fast track’ procedure was instituted where people were detained for a maximum of ten days to speedily resolve their claims. Mr Saadi and three other Iraqi Kurds who were applying to the UK for asylum were detained in the Oakington centre for a period of ten days under the regime in 2000. They brought a challenge to their detention, claiming that they had been unlawfully detained. Collins J held that detention regime was lawful according to domestic law, because it was done in accordance with the requirements of the UK Immigration Act. But he held that their detention was in breach of Article 5 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), which protects liberty and prohibits detention except in specified situations. The decision of Collins J was, however, overturned on appeal and the regime was held to be lawful. Importantly, though, the judges on appeal held that there was a requirement of proportionality between the detention and the purpose, which in this case was to process their applications speedily. In this case detaining someone for ten days was held to be proportionate. Whether the detention of people like the ‘NAMU’ family for a period of three years would be considered proportionate under the ECHR is another question! The differences in approach of the British courts in Saadi and the High Court of Australia in Lim can in large part be explained by the different status of the relevant international conventions in the UK and Australia. Like Australia, international law is not directly enforceable in the UK unless it has been incorporated into UK law. Importantly, the ECHR has been incorporated into UK law by the Human Rights Act 1998, unlike the ICCPR which, as we have outlined, is not directly enforceable in Australia. For this reason Mr Saadi and the other Iraqis were able to rely on the provisions of the ECHR and were not confined to arguing about the legality of the regime under domestic law. Just this week, the UK parliament has been engaged in heated debate over amendments to its Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill (2002) which will extend the number of ‘accommodation’ - read, detention - centres used in the UK. It even proposed the use of remote facilities (perhaps the UK could rent a desert facility from Australia!) but this proposal seems to have been defeated. Under the new regime, asylum seekers in the UK will be allowed to leave accommodation centres after six months if their applications have not been processed. While this represents a significant hardening of the UK position on asylum seekers, it makes plain the glaring inadequacies in the Australian system, particularly the absence of safeguards against prolonged and indefinite detention. Conclusion The right not to be arbitrarily detained has its origins in the birth of liberalism. It is also a fundamental human right protected by international conventions. It is clear, however, that the Australian government remains blind to the demands of international human rights law, revealing the impotence of non-enforceable norms. What that means for human rights advocates in Australia - and for asylum seekers in detention - is that the battlefield is not the international arena, but the domestic legal system. Whilst Lim’s case upheld the power of the government to place unauthorised arrivals into administrative detention, it did set some limits on that power, and the recent Federal Court cases are examples of this. Despite significant legislative and policy changes, Lim’s case has not been seriously reconsidered by the High Court. The cases currently before the Federal...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{description}} {{and analysis of the}} EU law and policy on Schengen visas. The EU visa policy is analysed in its historical development and its place in the framework of Schengen acquis. Separately, important visa policy measures are analysed including the typology of visas, exceptions from visa obligation, visa reciprocity, visa facilitation and processes of visa liberalisation. Different phases of the visa procedure are studied with focus on the questions whether there is a right to be issued a Schengen visa when the conditions are met and the right of appeal. The relevant legislation subject to analysis is above all the <b>Visa</b> <b>Code,</b> the regulation on visa lists and the relevant jurisprudence of the Court of Justice. By way of illustration, the implementation in the Czech legal order is used and jurisprudence of the Czech higher courts is quoted to show to what extent the EU visa procedure and visa refusal matches the requirements of the administrative law theory on the administrative procedure and decision in general. The relevant rules are assessed as to the extent they match with principles of legitimacy, influence of legal certainty, effectiveness and proportionality. The core of the work is a hypothesis that current EU visa rules do not establish a right to a visa when the [...] ...|$|E
