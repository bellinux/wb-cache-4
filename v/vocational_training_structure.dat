40|$|The article {{reviews the}} main {{conceptual}} and legal provisions and organizational activities {{carried out in}} the education system of the Russian Federation in order to introduce the new educational programs of applied bachelor degree. The problem of effective professionalization of higher education is extremely relevant due to the serious problems that Russian higher education currently faces. One of such problems is the lack of practical suitability of Bachelor graduates to the conditions and requirements of the actual labor. Responding to this problem, in Russia, as in most developed countries, {{there is a way to}} improve the professionalisation in the first stage of higher education - to divide the educational program of Bachelor into “academic” or “general” and “applied” or “professional”. The same issue is relevant to the different qualifications and assigns. The review of the experience of educational reforms in the leading European countries, where during the last 15 - 20 years some large-scale reforms with a view to the professionalization of higher education were carried out. It is important, that the essence of these reforms underlined the general problem of rapid modernization of <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> <b>structure</b> and content of educational programs in accordance with labor market demands and socially important requests of individual regions and the country in common. The analysis of the success of the reforms carried out in different countries, shows that it is common for all to establish a close relationship of employers and educational institutions at a sufficiently broad autonomy to the last, in cooperation with the state regulation of educational activities. This organic combination of theoretical and practical components of the secondary and higher vocational education programs of applied bachelor degree programs is to become the basis of the formation process of a new professional category, mostly demanded by the labor market...|$|E

Straipsnio išvados gali būti taikomos kuriant modulinio profesinio mokymo sistemą Lietuvoje. The aim of {{the article}} is to review the main {{principles}} of modular training structure. The module structure {{is based on the}} National Qualification Framework as well as political, administrative and programme dimensions. Qualitative research helped to determine the aspects and problematic points of module structure. Methodology is based on the liberalistic and pragmatic ideas which help to combine modular vocational training system. The objectives of the article are the following: • to discuss the place of vocational training module in the National Qualification Framework; • to define the criteria for composing structure of modular training programme/module composition; • {{on the basis of the}} results of the qualitative research to set out the dimensions of the modular <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> <b>structure.</b> 1. Vocational training module, a learning component developed for acquiring a certain part (unit) of qualification, determines the explicit learning path for acquiring qualification or part of it, that is reflected in the National Qualification Framework. The modular training is based on the clear split of qualification into the separate units upon which modules are developed. Qualification unit is realized through the module. It allows acquiring the set of competencies that is a constituent part of qualification and that helps to integrate and remain in the labour market. Each module is a structurized learning component of qualification activity partial competency. 2. The module structure criteria presuppose the presumable description of the module structure that determines the clear learning structure and is required for the curriculum development. 3. The empirical research helps to distinguish the following dimensions of modular training learning structure: political, administrative and programme. All these modular learning dimensions should be clearly regulated and defined...|$|E

The key perspective is on the effects of the growing complexity and highly dynamic nature of corporate structures, production and labour processes. Four different questions are investigated: What is the role of knowledge in value chain restructuring? What is the impact of value chain restructuring on the use and management of knowledge in the organisation? What is the impact on the required skills of the employees involved in restructuring? What are the effects on internal labour markets and on regional or sectoral <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> <b>structures?</b> The results of 58 organisational and 33 occupational case studies undertaken in the frame WORKS project form the major basis for this analysis.

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} the {{framework}} of a European project of the Leonardo da Vinci programme on the development of a European profile of skilled workers in the field of <b>vocational</b> <b>training.</b> It investigates the form in which the professionalization of skilled workers in the field of <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> is <b>structured,</b> the changes in the division of labor which can be observed among the different categories of skilled workers and the role of these changes play for specificaspects of the development of the system of <b>vocational</b> <b>training.</b> A closer analysis is made of the integration and the role of research within the processes of change {{as well as of the}} importance of innovation in the interlinking of structures of labor division among skilled workers in the field of <b>vocational</b> <b>training.</b> The apprenticeship training policy and the establishment of the sphere of higher technical education are analyzed as two specific cases. It is shown that traditional categories ofskilled workers can be differentiated from new ones. While a highly specialized and fragmented structure impeding an equal integration in the processes of change and innovation can be made out among traditional skilled workers in the field of <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> (teachers, administrative staff, politicians and lobbyists, researchers), more complex profiles are to be detected among the new skilled workers (human resource development, adult education, intermediaries). The new system of higher technical education differs from the fragmented traditional structure on the one hand by a stronger integration of responsibility profiles and the demand of an accordingly complex profile of skilled workers, who, on the other hand, do not always find adequate job opportunities. ...|$|R
40|$|As a {{first step}} of the dissertation, a {{theoretical}} model was derived from school research, in which significant factors of influence on cognitive knowledge acquirement are indicated. Based on the state-of-the-art of school research, the “Angebots-Nutzungs-Modell” by Helmke (2009) was selected as a theoretical basis and systematically extended, {{in order to discuss}} its transferability on further vocations training. Within this process, four levels for analysis were introduced: the systemic setting, the training institution, the class and the learner. In the empirical part of the work, the practical-conceptual relevance of such a model as an orientation for practical action was discussed with professionals of further <b>vocational</b> <b>training.</b> The <b>structure</b> of the model as well as the derived factors of influence on knowledge acquisition of adult learners met the professional beliefs of the interviewed professionals, whereby the relevance of the model could generally be confirmed. Further factors of influence, which were mentioned by the experts as specific for the setting of further <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> – like time and organizational compatibility of the training with other commitments of the adult learner – were integrated in the model. Two ideal types were defined and analyzed in the work: further <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> inside and outside a company. In the interviews, different professional beliefs and therefore different professional self-concepts became apparent. These are mainly related to a different understanding of their role, focus of content offered, and an accordingly different target group. Considerable differences could be identified regarding the influence factors “social context”, “time in class” and “systemic conditions”. As an outlook, concrete need for action in further <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> could be identified within the analysis of the finding of the interviews...|$|R

40|$|As {{a country}} endowed with labour, India's {{situation}} {{is at best}} ironic. On the one hand, domestic economic growth has created huge employment demand and job opportunities, while on the other, a shortage of skills is making more people unemployable.
