40|$|In 2007 a {{pilot study}} {{in the form of}} a {{quantitative}} survey among New Zealand-based students was undertaken to determine their use and perceptions of the Internet as a communication tool and source of information and knowledge. While the topic is not necessarily "new", ongoing research of this kind is deemed relevant given the rapid changes in the transference of information and knowledge, and the role communication plays in this. A few of the initial key findings are presented in this paper. The results provide insight into students' current perceptions and use of the Internet, compared to a small number of select other, more traditional information sources. Although several trends appear to be emerging from this research such as an age bias towards the use of the Internet, general use seems to be highly personal and varied, and appear to underscore research in other fields that point towards personality being a determining factor rather than age. An interesting finding was that perceptions of reliability and citing sources for academic work were frequently shaped by tutors and tutors' perceptions of source reliability, signifying the need for educational leadership from tutors to provide guidelines regarding the reliability of emerging sources such as podcasts, video podcasts (<b>vidcasts),</b> blogs and wikipages. Overall, this research raises several new and interesting questions, pointing the way for further in-depth research that could add to the body of knowledge of Communication...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} {{presents}} the learning journey towards {{the development of}} <b>vidcasts</b> at Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU). This was undertaken by the Effective Learning Service (ELS) and the Spoken Word Team at GCU. ELS was established in 2001 as a service that is available to all students irrespective of level, background or programme. It is currently located within the Learner Support Department together with other centralised services including Spoken Word, Careers, the Library, and Disability Services. The ELS has developed extensive, collaborative partnerships across schools, in the planning and delivery of context based workshops. Spoken Word Services originated in the international Spoken Word project, which aimed to transform higher education through the integration of digitised audio into learning and teaching. A collaboration and legal deposit agreement with BBC Information & Archives allows Spoken Word {{to make use of}} audio and video programmes from the BBC’s extensive archive for teaching and learning purposes. At GCU it is responsible for providing tools and technologies, coping with intellectual property rights, supplying engaging and valuable content, and encouraging reflection on the learning and teaching process. The team recognises that teachers need to develop ‘pedagogical pluralism’ and, in this context, aims to encourage students and their teachers to “write on and for the internet” (Wallace and Donald, 2008). Spoken Word has extensive experience in producing podcasts and exciting interactive material collaboratively. Working with the REAP Project (Re-Engineering Assessment Practices), Spoken Word has applied video podcasts as a driver for change, replacing a one hour weekly lecture with a 15 minute video podcast designed around a blend of a lecturer’s narration, BBC audio and video clips, and related to the lecturer’s own PowerPoint slides (REAP Pilot Projects, 2007) ...|$|R
40|$|Both {{papers were}} {{presented}} {{on the same}} day in a multi-track conference – Paper 2 on metacognition at 0830 and Paper 1 on continuous response (with co-author Tony Tin) at 1400. Sessions were well-attended, about 35 attendees in the morning and 70 in the afternoon. Both papers elicited questions from the audience. The paper on metacognitive skills brought new linkages with researchers in Greenland and Finland where similar problems and interests arise. The paper on continuous response elicited more discussion and an invitation to collaborate with researchers at University of Foggia in Italy, 1. Continuous response evaluation of video and film has been a useful method in media. It has been particularly prevalent in advertising as it allows producers to pinpoint events that evoke particularly strong audience responses. When searching for a way {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} digital video clips (podcasts) a continuous response evaluation system was developed and deployed over the internet. This paper discusses the preliminary results of testing the method with adult and high school learners to evaluate a series of video podcasts on meta-cognitive success strategies. When fully deployed this tool will enable the real time viewer evaluation of internet video formats such as Youtube. The resulting data could be used to rate the overall interest of video programs or index specific scenes for educational or entertainment contexts. 2. Following the spread of internet connectivity in Canada, almost every university college and public school has introduced online courses. The increased access has made a wide range of courses from high school onwards available, and students of all academic abilities are stumbling around in the unfamiliar world of on-line learning. This paper demonstrates a series of 7 short (3 minute) digital video clips (<b>vidcasts)</b> produced to introduce meta-cognitive success strategies to online high school students, their parents and teachers. Stressing well-informed choices, planning and pro-active communication skills, the series targets francophone high school students in minority language environments where on-line courses are rapidly providing access to a greater selection of courses. Results of preliminary evaluations with high school and adult learners will be discussed...|$|R

50|$|York Country Day School {{was founded}} in 1953 on Springettsbury Avenue, led by Mr. Henry M. Thornton Sr. and {{assisted}} by Headmaster Mr. Kenneth Snyder. The original house was purchased for $15,000 and renovated for another $15,000. Thirty-nine students enrolled, and teachers were hired to instruct sixth through ninth grade in all subjects: reading, writing, arithmetic, history, French and Latin. After two years, the house on Springettsbury reached its capacity. In need of more space for more students {{and a set of}} athletic fields, Mr. George Whiteley generously donated 10 acres of land on Regents Glen Boulevard. He later donated another 5 acres, to complete the current 15-acre footprint. In 1956, the school officially opened and classes began with seventh through 12th grades filled. A year later, In 1957, the first YCDS all-female class of 13 students graduated from high school. As years passed, the school continued to expand to include grades one through six. In 1976, York Country Day School and York College of Pennsylvania combined operational efforts under one organization.In the mid nineteen-eighties, the YCP Board of Trustees created the comprehensive Plan for Excellence to guide the school through its fourth decade and beyond, and the first phase of that plan was completed with the construction of a preschool wing, science laboratory, and lower level dining and athletic facilities. The second phase of the plan focused on a new curriculum that emphasized academics, expanded extracurricular activities, and athletic opportunities. The Board of Trustees augmented the school’s graduation requirements and added more language, social studies, and science to the curriculum, and a new preschool program for 2- and 3-year-olds. All of these improvements were designed to prepare students for admission to the most demanding institutions of higher learning. In 1990, the Multi-Purpose Room was completed. This provided space for lunch, small dramatic productions, physical education, social events and athletic practices. In 1992, a strategic plan was adopted to enhance and update the facilities, as well as to grow enrollment. A big year for York Country Day came in 1994, when the East Wing of the upper school was completed, that included six classrooms, an additional science lab, office and commons area. Big changes for York Country Day came in the 21st century, starting in 2014, when the 13th Head of School Dr. Christine Heine successfully launched a $14.6-million campaign that the York College Board of Trustees unanimously approved. This strategic plan supports the already rigorous program in place through the construction of the Ann B. Barshinger Center for the Arts and the Brougher Center for Innovation and Technology in the STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics) building. The STEAM center includes a Robotics and Bionics lab, <b>VidCast</b> Studio, Digital Arts Workshop, Metal and Wood shops, numerous collaborative learning spaces and much more. In 2016, the school entrance shifts from Regents Glen Boulevard to Indian Rock Dam Road, creating a dramatic new entry way for drop-off and pickup. Renovation to the Upper and Middle Level classrooms and the creation of an outdoor classroom in lower school are part of the construction, as well as numerous collaborative learning spaces. In Spring 2017, the final renovations in the Upper and Middle schools were complete.|$|E

40|$|In 1995, then writing center {{director}} Muriel Harris and {{her staff}} developed and launched the precursor to the Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL). Originally, this was an in-house writing resource for Purdue University faculty and staff. Since then, however, the Purdue OWL has become a prime location for community engagement both locally and globally, with over 200, 000, 000 hits annually. This poster at the Purdue University Academic Community Engagement Poster Presentations demonstrates {{the impact of the}} Purdue OWL both locally and globally. It will also highlight how that engagement has changed overtime, through the growth the Purdue OWL’s static resources, to the creation of PowerPoint-based workshops, to the creation of audio pod-casts, and most recently, the deployment of <b>vidcast</b> lectures. Through the presentation of data from the Purdue Writing Lab Annual report, and a recent Purdue OWL English as a Foreign Language (EFL) usage survey, the poster will highlight just how the Purdue OWL has enabled the university to engage with a global community of writers, writing teachers, and writing students. The presenters will then share their experiences working on the Purdue OWL and how this has shaped their professional development and their own scholarshi...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore recent trends in the {{application}} of Web 2. 0 and Library 2. 0 features as exemplified through university library web sites around the world. Design/methodology/approach – The top 100 universities from the ranked list of 200 provided on the Times Higher Education web site were considered for collection of data and from this list a selection was made of 57 of these universities. This selection was based on whether the site was in English and whether it had at least one Web 2. 0 feature. For each of these universities their web sites were visited and data on their Web 2. 0 features (such as Blogs, RSS, Instant Messaging, Wikis and the like) were collected and analyzed. Findings – Results reveal that 37 university libraries use RSS feeds for dissemination of library news, events and announcements and 15 university libraries provide blog space for users. Whereas wiki is the least applied Web 2. 0 technology, with only one university using it, Instant Messaging is another most widely applied feature with 37 libraries already providing reference service through it. Podcast (used in three libraries) and <b>Vidcast</b> (used in six libraries) are yet to become popular facilities to be offered in university library web sites. Research limitations/implications – The study is based on the university ranking for 2007, as the World Top 200 Universities 2008 was not published until October 2008 when this article was being finalized. However, this does not affect the outcome of the Web 2. 0 features being utilized by the universities. Originality/value – Most of the earlier studies on the subject deal with Web 2. 0 tools and how they could be used in the library context. The present paper, however, provides concrete evidence of the application of Web 2. 0 in university libraries. As such it should prove of interest to all types of libraries, even though its context is university libraries.

40|$|M 3, {{a project}} {{blending}} a MUVE (Second Life) the Moodle VLE and a Microblogging tool (Twitter), {{set out to}} explore the use of emerging technologies {{within the context of}} a pre-arrival online course for international students coming to live and study in the UK. The objective was to create an immersive learning experience for students by adapting and extending some of the Moodle course activities (‘learning objects’, vidcasts and discussion offered through the VLE) for use in the virtual world environment of Second Life. The project also aimed to gauge the educational potential of the microblogging service, Twitter, in linking students together during the course for both social networking and <b>vidcast</b> discussion purposes. A technical aspect of the project was to develop Twitter plug-ins or ‘blocks’ for Moodle allowing students to view a Twitter feed from within Moodle. Work was also needed to adapt existing course resources and activities for in-world use in a designated course area within Second Life. The M 3 project then explored the combined use of Moodle, Twitter and Second Life with three separate sets of learners/users. These were: a group of students - professional and experienced teachers from countries outside the UK - learning about the educational use of new technologies on a face-to-face Masters course at the University of Southampton; international students on a pre-arrival course delivered wholly online through Moodle, who were preparing to come to the UK; an external group of educators and practitioners taking part in JISC Emerge conferences. During and after user engagement in the project, data was gathered from questionnaires, interviews and observations. A number of practical factors impacted on participation levels of different groups but the affordances offered by these new technologies were widely appreciated even if the technologies themselves can still present challenges for new users unless significant levels of support are given. Their scope for enhancing social presence within a learning context was found to complement students’ interest in meeting people and sharing pictures and personal information, and reflects their own use and interest in Web 2. 0 technologies. The developed Twitter blocks for Moodle and Second Life learning resources are being taken forward and future projects building on these outputs are planned. This presentation will present the M 3 project and its findings. The Moodle online course and Second Life learning resources will also be demonstrated...|$|E
