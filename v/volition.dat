5|$|Like his heroes Swedenborg and Saint-Martin, Balzac {{attempts}} in Louis Lambert {{to construct a}} viable theory to unify spirit and matter. Young Lambert attempts this goal in his Traité de la Volonté, which – having been confiscated by a teacher – is described by the narrator:The word Will he used to connote... the mass of power by which man can reproduce, outside himself, the actions constituting his external life.... The word Mind, or Thought, which he regarded as the quintessential product of the Will, also represented the medium in which the ideas originate to which thought gives substance.... Thus the Will and the Mind were the two generating forces; the <b>Volition</b> and the Idea were the two products. <b>Volition,</b> he thought, was the Idea evolved from the abstract state to a concrete state, from its generative fluid to a solid expression.... According to him, the Mind and Ideas are the motion and the outcome of our inner organization, just as the Will and <b>Volition</b> are of our external activity. He gave the Will precedence over the Mind.The exploration of human will and thought is linked to Balzac's interest in Franz Mesmer, who postulated the theory of animal magnetism, a force flowing among humans. The narrator invokes Mesmer twice in the text, and describes {{a section of the}} Traité de la Volonté which reflects the animal-magnetic theory.|$|E
50|$|Higher-order <b>volitions</b> (or higher-order desire), {{as opposed}} to action-determining <b>volitions,</b> are <b>volitions</b> about <b>volitions.</b> Higher-order <b>volitions</b> are {{potentially}} more often guided by long-term convictions and reasoning.|$|R
40|$|According to Malebranche’s occasionalism, {{all cases}} of {{causation}} {{in the world}} are due to the action of God’s will. These actions are divided into 2 ̆ 2 particular <b>volitions</b> 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 general <b>volitions</b> 2 ̆ 2. There has been sharp disagreement in the secondary literature concerning the nature of general <b>volitions,</b> for Malebranche. One side claims that general <b>volitions</b> are <b>volitions</b> of wide scope which cover a multiplicity of potential situations. The other side claims that general <b>volitions</b> are specific but fall under the scope of broader laws of nature. I draw on the quantifier apparatus of modern predicate logic to highlight {{the differences between the two}} views, which I refer to as the Universality view and the Regularity view respectively. I also outline a third ‘Hybrid’ view that borrows elements of each. I conclude that there is a fundamental ambiguity in Malebranche’s account of general <b>volitions</b> which prevents any one account from fully fitting with Malebranche’s remarks...|$|R

5|$|The International Criminal Court's {{prosecutor}} may open {{a formal}} investigation {{in one of}} three circumstances: when a situation is referred by the government of a state which the investigation concerns, when the situation is referred by the UN Security Council or under his own <b>volition</b> with authorisation from a Pre-Trial Chamber.|$|E
5|$|<b>Volition</b> {{aimed for}} a quality release, {{and promised to}} deliver a product without major bugs. Minor bugs would be fixed in a prompt manner. The shipped game, however, had {{deficiencies}} admitted by the team, such as problems with the multiplayer code, and a few design issues. The game underwent four patches, which resolved most of the bugs, and improved the multiplayer performance. Complaints about an online mission giving unfair scores led to <b>Volition</b> removing the mission from scoring play. Another patch allowed EAX capability to be enabled for Creative Sound Blaster sound cards. Interplay played its part in drumming up the community's interest by holding contests, and expanding material for the FreeSpace universe. Meanwhile, <b>Volition</b> created official star maps, and released Vasudan voice clips and story development notes. Interplay hired science-fiction writers such as Fred Saberhagen, Simon Hawke, and Jeff Grubb to write weekly FreeSpace stories for two months. Preparing for Silent Threats release, Interplay held a contest from July 28 to August 25, 1998, in which the submitted fan-designed missions could win their authors prizes such as free copies of Silent Threat, FreeSpace apparel, and gaming hardware. Entries were judged by a panel from PC Gamer, and qualified entries constituted half of the missions in Silent Threat.|$|E

When he refused, he was placed under house arrest on 13 April, and shortly afterwards in close confinement. On 20 April, he signed the Interim and was immediately freed.|$|E
5000|$|Saṃskāra or Saṅkhāra in Buddhism {{refers to}} mental [...] "dispositions".

Buddhism {{emphasizes}} the need to purify dispositions (Saṅkhāra) rather than eliminate them.|$|R
50|$|In essence, Kant {{is saying}} that Reason is outside of the causative {{elements}} {{of the natural world}} and as such is not subject to the law of cause and effect. Hence, for Kant, Reason needs no prior explanation for any of its choices or <b>volitions.</b> Ryle's assumption is that all <b>volitions</b> are physicalistic processes and thus subject to cause and effect. If such is the case, then Ryle would be correct in his regress. However, if some <b>volitions</b> are not subject to cause and effect, per Kant, then Ryle's regress fails.|$|R
60|$|Our {{enumeration}} commenced with Feelings. These we scrupulously {{distinguished from}} the objects which excite them, and from the organs by which they are, or may be supposed to be, conveyed. Feelings are of four sorts: Sensations, Thoughts, Emotions, and <b>Volitions.</b> What are called Perceptions are merely a particular case of Belief, and Belief {{is a kind of}} thought. Actions are merely <b>volitions</b> followed by an effect.|$|R
5|$|In 2002, <b>Volition</b> {{released}} the source code {{for the game}} engine under a non-commercial license. This code became {{the core of the}} FreeSpace 2 Source Code Project, which continuously improves it and enables new features. In cooperation with the FreeSpace Upgrade Project the game's graphics are kept up to date. The improved game engine is also used by various mod projects, for example The Babylon Project and Diaspora which are based on the science fiction series Babylon 5 and Battlestar Galactica respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1244 {{a band of}} Khwarezmian mercenaries {{travelling}} to Egypt {{to serve}} As-Salih Ismail, Emir of Damascus, seemingly of their own <b>volition,</b> captured Jerusalem en route and defeated a combined Christian and Syrian army at the Battle of La Forbie. In response, LouisIX, king of France, organised a Crusade, called the Seventh Crusade, to attack Egypt, arriving in 1249. It was not a success. Louis was defeated at Mansura and captured as he retreated to Damietta. Another truce was agreed upon for a ten-year period, and Louis was ransomed. Louis remained in Syria until 1254 to consolidate the Crusader states. From 1265 to 1271, the Mamluk sultan Baibars drove the Franks to a few small coastal outposts.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Adams Cram, the university's supervising architect, {{designed}} and oversaw {{construction of the}} new chapel. Cram sought to build a crown jewel for the Collegiate Gothic motif he had championed on the Princeton campus. The university's president, John Grier Hibben, also had {{a stake in the}} project: student hostility toward Princeton's brand of mainline Presbyterianism was on the rise. An ordained minister, Hibben hoped the new chapel's majesty would inspire students to attend services of their own <b>volition.</b> Cram, a convert to High Church Episcopalianism from Unitarianism, also lent support to this aim.|$|E

60|$|The {{question}} how far human <b>volitions</b> {{are subject to}} causal laws is a purely empirical one. Empirically it seems plain that {{the great majority of}} our <b>volitions</b> have causes, but it cannot, on this account, be held necessarily certain that all have causes. There are, however, precisely the same kinds of reasons for regarding it as probable that they all have causes as there are in the case of physical events.|$|R

5|$|The news of FreeSpace 2 {{being in}} {{development}} was confirmed in a chat on November 6, 1998. FreeSpace 2 {{was developed in}} less than one year. The <b>Volition</b> team revealed they had written up a story and will be targeting high-end hardware with dogfights for {{a greater number of}} ships and even larger and more deadly capital ships. The team set themselves the goals of setting new standards for both single-player and multiplayer space combat simulations, and started to modify the FreeSpace game engine for FreeSpace 2. This team was the same team which had worked on Descent: FreeSpace, plus several new members. In order to flesh out the story, <b>Volition</b> hired Jason Scott as a full-time writer before work even started. The linear mission structure was adopted as it was decided it would help the immersion factor of the story greatly. As the relations between the Terrans and Vasudans dominated the first game, it was decided to scale the focus down to a personal level with Admiral Bosch and his decisions to rebel. Scott's close work with the designers, and co-ordination of the voice recording process helped to tightly integrate the story into the missions, giving a more sophisticated feel to the story.|$|E
5|$|The {{surfaces}} {{should be}} broad and simple, {{defined by a}} bold and clear design, accentuated in the important places. The enlargement of the details or their multiplicity is to be feared. By exaggerating the forms, in order to render them more clearly visible, or by enriching them with details, we would destroy {{the proportion of the}} work. Finally, the model, like the design, should have a summarized character, such as one would give to a rapid sketch. Only it is necessary that this character should be the product of <b>volition</b> and study, and that the artist, concentrating his knowledge, should find the form and the line in its greatest simplicity.|$|E
5|$|Descent: FreeSpace – The Great War, {{also known}} as Conflict: FreeSpace – The Great War in Europe, is a 1998 space combat {{simulation}} IBM PC compatible computer game developed by <b>Volition,</b> when it was split off from Parallax Software, and published by Interplay Productions. In 2001, it was ported to the Amiga platform as FreeSpace: The Great War by Hyperion Entertainment. The game places players {{in the role of}} a human pilot, who operates in several classes of starfighter and combats against opposing forces, either human or alien, in various space-faring environments, such as in orbit above a planet or within an asteroid belt. The story of the game's single player campaign focuses on a war in the 24th century between two factions, one human and the other alien, that is interrupted in its fourteenth year by the arrival of an enigmatic and militant alien race, whose genocidal advance forces the two sides into a ceasefire in order to work together to halt the threat.|$|E
6000|$|... § 1. The question, {{whether the}} law of {{causality}} applies in the same strict sense to human actions as to other phenomena, is the celebrated controversy concerning {{the freedom of the}} will; which, from at least {{as far back as the}} time of Pelagius, has divided both the philosophical and the religious world. The affirmative opinion is commonly called the doctrine of Necessity, as asserting human <b>volitions</b> and actions to be necessary and inevitable. The negative maintains that the will is not determined, like other phenomena, by antecedents, but determines itself; that our <b>volitions</b> are not, properly speaking, the effects of causes, or at least have no causes which they uniformly and implicitly obey.|$|R

5|$|On 6 November 2009 the ICC Presidency {{assigned}} {{the situation in}} Kenya to Pre-Trial Chamber II and the prosecutor made an application to that chamber for authorisation to open a formal investigation on 26 November. The judges of the pre-trial chamber granted this authorisation on 31 March 2010. The judges who made this decision, Ekaterina Trendafilova, Hans-Peter Kaul and Cuno Tarfusser noted in their written ruling that while Article 15 of the Rome Statute does allow for the Prosecutor to investigate and prosecute a case of his own <b>volition,</b> {{this is one of}} the more controversial aspects of the ICC. In the ICC's history, this case was the first time the Prosecutor decided to investigate a case in this manner, with all prior cases being referred to the Court either by a national government, or by the United Nations Security Council.|$|E
5|$|On 7 May, {{a second}} {{operation}} {{was conducted by}} the same units, {{this time in the}} northern Armenian town of Voskepar. Under the same pretext as the previous operation, the joint forces entered Armenia with tanks and other armored vehicles, claiming that militia units were staging attacks from that area into Azerbaijan. The operation was conducted in a similar manner but with deadlier results. In addition to the arbitrary arrests of twenty men in towns surrounding Voskepar, a bus carrying thirty Armenian policemen was attacked by elements of the 23rd Division, killing eleven of the officers and arresting the rest. The OMON units also took part in razing and looting the outlying villages around Voskepar. Residents were similarly forced to leave their homes and thus ceded them after signing a form which stated that they were leaving their homes at their own <b>volition.</b>|$|E
5|$|Saints Row IV {{is an open}} world action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by <b>Volition</b> and published by Deep Silver. It is the fourth title in the Saints Row series. In the game, the playable character {{is the leader of}} the 3rd Street Saints, a street gang that has become the world's most powerful and popular organization, and must fend off an alien invasion after becoming President of the United States and receiving superpowers. The player is free to explore their environment while completing main and side missions at their leisure. The game incorporates elements from science fiction video games and films, and continues the series' reputation for over-the-top parody. It was released in August 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, and was later ported to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Linux in 2015.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{classify}} the degree of health and to analyze the elements in life styles determining health patterns, especially from sociological aspects. The survey was conducted to 887 male and 893 female adults by questionnaire method. The non-hierachical cluster analysis {{was applied to the}} data, from which following results were obtained : 1) Five clusters were extracted on health, and the relationship of each clusters with the elements in life styles were examined. First cluster (assidous type) was very high level in social and mental health, but not high in physical health, and it had strong concerns on health and considerably good social conditions. Second cluster (irritated type) was high level in physical health, but the lowest level in social and mental health, and it was very bad in concerns on health, life activities and life conditions. Third cluster (1 ively type) was the highest level in health, life conditions, sport involvements and those <b>volitions.</b> Fourth cluster (waver type) was the lowest level in physical and mental health, and in all behaviors, <b>volitions</b> and conditions. In addition, fifth cluster (free type) was high level in health and life conditions, but it had not so strong concerns on health and life problems. 2) The relationship between health patterns and elements to them were analyzed. Consequently, people who were in good health states were higher level in social conditions, past and present sport involvements, social involvements and those <b>volitions...</b>|$|R
5|$|Saints Row IV was {{released}} in several summative editions. The Game of the Century edition included 20 downloadable content sets and {{was released}} May 9, 2014. The National Treasure Edition included 29 downloadable content sets and was released on July 8, 2014. High Voltage Software ported the game to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One {{with all of its}} downloadable content as Saints Row IV: Re-Elected. It was announced in late August 2014 alongside , a standalone Saints Row IV expansion developed by <b>Volition</b> in conjunction with High Voltage. Both were released in North America on January 20, 2015, and worldwide three days later, both separately and bundled together. The release included new features such as voice commands. A Linux port was presented in December 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{team also}} pre-visualized rough drafts to sketch ideas {{for others to}} advance. For example, the introductory airplane level was pre-visualized two years prior to its creation as a demonstration for the development team and publisher. Levels were built in Volition's Core Technology Group (CTG) editor, which was continually built {{in the four years}} preceding release. Like the other two titles, Saints Row: The Third was built in the Havok physics engine with customizations. The engine let the team build vehicle drifting physics and the VTOL aircraft. The studio considered the Red Faction series' Geo-Mod 2 engine but chose against it due to the implementation's difficulty and not wanting that degree of destruction. Phillips gave a game development postmortem at the 2012 Game Developers Conference, where he advised studios to let development team members run with their ideas. <b>Volition</b> began to add modding support to the title and series in mid 2013.|$|E
5|$|The website asserts to its {{visitors}} {{that all}} performers engaged in sexual activities {{depicted in the}} videos appear of their own <b>volition</b> and feel bliss and gratification from the experience. The majority of new entrants to the adult film industry enjoyed their work with Fucking Machines because they discovered it was more socially acceptable to perform with a sexual device, rather than a human partner. Public relations manager for Kink.com Thomas Roche observed in a 2009 interview that Fucking Machines {{did not have a}} focus on BDSM material. In September 2010 the site had a live filming with an audience of 40 spectators, followed by the introduction in November 2010 of an interactive format in which viewers could watch shoots and recommend devices for the participants. By 2012 the site had 500 hours of archival footage with adult film performers, including Alexis Texas, Flower Tucci, and Sasha Grey.|$|E
60|$|We may now sum up our {{discussion}} of causality. We found first that the law of causality, as usually stated by philosophers, is false, and is not employed in science. We then considered the nature of scientific laws, and found that, instead of stating that one event A is always followed by another event B, they stated functional relations between certain events at certain times, which we called determinants, and other events at earlier or later times or at the same time. We were unable to find any a priori category involved: the existence of scientific laws appeared as a purely empirical fact, not necessarily universal, except in a trivial and scientifically useless form. We found that a system with one set of determinants may very likely have other sets of a quite different kind, that, for example, a mechanically determined system may also be teleologically or volitionally determined. Finally we considered the problem of free will: here {{we found that the}} reasons for supposing <b>volitions</b> to be determined are strong but not conclusive, and we decided that even if <b>volitions</b> are mechanically determined, that is no reason for denying freedom in the sense revealed by introspection, or for supposing that mechanical events are not determined by <b>volitions.</b> The problem of free will versus determinism is therefore, if we were right, mainly illusory, but in part not yet capable of being decisively solved.|$|R

As Shakespeare says, the poet gives to “airy nothing”,in the sense of vague and confused feelings and thoughts, “a local habitation and a name”...|$|R
