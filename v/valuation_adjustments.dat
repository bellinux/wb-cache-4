30|$|In {{the present}} paper we apply this {{framework}} to the concrete setup of a bank engaged in bilateral trade portfolios. In this context, the discounted expectation of losses due to the default of counterparties or of the bank itself are respectively known as CVA (credit <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment)</b> and DVA (debt <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment).</b> Counterparty risk mitigants include the variation margin (VM), tracking the mark-to-market of client portfolios, and the initial margin (IM) set as a cushion against gap risk, which is the risk of slippage between the portfolio and its variation margin during liquidation periods. The cost of funding cash collateral for the variation margin is known as funding <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (FVA), while the cost of funding segregated collateral posted as initial margin is the margin <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (MVA). Contra-liability counterparts of the FVA and the MVA arise as the FDA (funding debt adjustment) and the MDA (margin debt adjustment). The contra-liability component of a unilateral CVA is dubbed CVACL.|$|R
40|$|The credit {{crisis and}} the ongoing European {{sovereign}} debt crisis have highlighted the native form of credit risk, namely the counterparty risk. The related credit <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (CVA), debt <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (DVA), liquidity <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (LVA) and replacement cost (RC) issues, jointly referred to in this paper as total <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (TVA), have been thoroughly investigated in the theoretical papers [7] and [8]. The present work provides an executive summary and numerical companion to these papers, through which the TVA pricing problem {{can be reduced to}} Markovian pre-default TVA BSDEs. The first step consists in the counterparty clean valuation of a portfolio of contracts, which is the valuation in a hypothetical situation where the two parties would be risk-free and funded at a risk-free rate. In the second step, the TVA is obtained as the value of an option on the counterparty clean value process called contingent credit default swap (CCDS).

Stochastic intensity models are adopted for the default events, and defaults are connected through a copula function. We find that both default correlation and credit spread volatility have a relevant impact on the positive counterparty-risk credit <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> to be subtracted from the counterparty-risk free price.

40|$|This book {{presents}} 20 peer-reviewed {{chapters on}} current aspects of derivatives markets and derivative pricing. The contributions, written by leading {{researchers in the}} field as well as experienced authors from the financial industry, present {{the state of the}} art in: • Modeling counterparty credit risk: credit <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment,</b> debit <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment,</b> funding <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment,</b> and wrong way risk. • Pricing and hedging in fixed-income markets and multi-curve interest-rate modeling. • Recent developments concerning contingent convertible bonds, the measuring of basis spreads, and the modeling of implied correlations. The recent financial crisis has cast tremendous doubts on the classical view on derivative pricing. Now, counterparty credit risk and liquidity issues are integral aspects of a prudent valuation procedure and the reference interest rates are represented by a multitude of curves according to their different periods and maturities. A panel discussion included in the book (featuring Damiano Brigo, Christian Fries, John Hull, and Daniel Sommer) on the foundations of modeling and pricing in the presence of counterparty credit risk provides intriguing insights on the debate. ...|$|R

40|$|Credit (CVA), Debit (DVA) and Funding <b>Valuation</b> <b>Adjustments</b> (FVA) are now {{familiar}} <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments</b> made to {{the value}} of a portfolio of derivatives to account for credit risks and funding costs. However, recent changes in the regulatory regime and the increases in regulatory capital requirements has led many banks to include the cost of capital in derivative pricing. This paper formalises the addition of cost of capital by extending the Burgard-Kjaer (2013) semi-replication approach to CVA and FVA to include an addition capital term, Capital Valuation Adjustment (KVA, i. e. Kapital Valuation Adjustment to distinguish from CVA.) The utilization of the capital for funding purposes is also considered. The use of the semi-replication approach means that the flexibility around the treatment of self-default is carried over into this analysis. The paper further considers the practical calculation of KVA with reference to the Basel II (BCBS- 128) and Basel III (BCBS- 189) capital regimes and their implementation via CRD IV. The paper also assesses how KVA may be hedged, given that any hedging transactions themselves lead to regulatory capital requirements and hence capital costs. Finally a number of numerical examples are presented to gauge the cost impact of KVA on vanilla derivative products. Comment: 25 pages, 6 table...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of CCPs in most derivative transactions will dramatically change {{the landscape of}} derivatives pricing, hedging and risk management, and, according to the TABB group, will lead to an overall liquidity impact about 2 USD trillions. In this article we develop {{for the first time}} a comprehensive approach for pricing under CCP clearing, including variation and initial margins, gap credit risk and collateralization, showing concrete examples for interest rate swaps. Mathematically, the inclusion of asymmetric borrowing and lending rates in the hedge of a claim lead to nonlinearities showing up in claim dependent pricing measures, aggregation dependent prices, nonlinear PDEs and BSDEs. This still holds in presence of CCPs and CSA. We introduce a modeling approach that allows us to enforce rigorous separation of the interconnected nonlinear risks into different <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments</b> where the key pricing nonlinearities are confined to a funding costs component that is analyzed through numerical schemes for BSDEs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is {{introducing}} rigorous methods and formulas for bilateral counterparty risk credit <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (CVA) on interest-rate portfolios. In doing so, we summarize the general arbitrage-free valuation framework for counterparty risk adjustments in presence of bilateral default risk, including the default of the investor. We illustrate the symmetry in the valuation and show that the adjustment involves a long position in a put option plus a short position in a call option, both with zero strike and written on the residual net present value of the contract at the relevant default times. We allow for correlation between the default times of the investor and counterparty, and for correlation of each with the underlying risk factor, namely interest rates. We also analyze the often neglected impact of credit spread volatility. We include close-out netting rules in our examples, although other agreements, such as periodic margining or collateral posting, are left for future work.

30|$|Capital {{valuation}} adjustment (KVA) {{accounts for}} the cost of equity capital a bank incurs when entering a derivative trade. To explain the concept, some would say KVA is affine to FVA, in the sense that, in both cases, the cost is associated with a source of funding. The difference is that KVA, rather than measuring the funding cost coming from debt, refers to the funding cost from equity. That is, as a new deal is agreed on, it generates a cost of borrowing from the shareholder. That cost is normally of comparable scale to that of other <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments,</b> which means its importance cannot be underestimated.|$|E

Of course, if all three terms appearing in (74) (that is: the full price, the clean price, and the total <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment)</b> are given by solutions to particular linear BSDEs, then {{it is possible to}} argue that decomposition (74) can be formally justified. However, if the <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (and thus also the full price) is given by a solution to a nonlinear BSDE, which is the case of our primary interest, then the two terms appearing in the right-hand side in (74) cannot be computed separately and subsequently aggregated to obtain the full price.

Therefore, in our opinion, the introduction of the concept of the clean price, although convenient in practice since it refers to the pre-crisis experience and facilitates calibration of commonly used models for the underlying securities, may further complicate the theoretical problem of searching for the full price of a contract and the corresponding hedging strategy when working in a nonlinear setup.|$|R
