2500|$|In dilute solution, the {{properties}} of the polymer are characterized by the interaction between the solvent and the polymer. In a good solvent, the polymer appears swollen and occupies a large volume. In this scenario, intermolecular forces between the solvent and monomer subunits dominate over intramolecular interactions. In a bad solvent or poor solvent, intramolecular forces dominate and the chain contracts. In the theta solvent, or the state of the polymer solution where the value of the second <b>virial</b> <b>coefficient</b> becomes 0, the intermolecular polymer-solvent repulsion balances exactly the intramolecular monomer-monomer attraction. Under the theta condition (also called the Flory condition), the polymer behaves like an ideal random coil. [...] The transition between the states is known as a coil-globule transition.|$|E

40|$|Using a {{relation}} between the <b>virial</b> expansion <b>coefficients</b> of the pressure and the entropy expansion coefficients {{in the case of}} the monomer-dimer model on infinite regular lattices, we have shown that, on hypercubic lattices of any dimension, the <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients</b> are positive through the 20 th order. We have observed that all <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients</b> so far known for this system are positive also on infinite regular lattices with different structure. We are thus led to conjecture that the <b>virial</b> expansion <b>coefficients</b> m_k are always positive. These considerations can be extended to the study of related bounds on finite graphs generalizing the infinite regular lattices, namely the finite grids and the regular biconnected graphs. The validity of the bounds Δ^k ln(i!

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} pH and {{electrolyte}} concentration on protein-protein interactions in lysozyme and chymotrypsinogen solutions were investigated by static light scattering (SLS) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Very good {{agreement between the}} values of the <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients</b> measured by SLS and SANS was obtained without use of adjustable parameters. At low electrolyte concentration, the <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients</b> depend strongly on pH and change from positive to negative as the pH increases. All coefficients at high salt concentration are slightly negative and depend weakly on pH. For lysozyme, the coefficients always decrease with increasing electrolyte concentration. However, for chymotrypsinogen there is a cross-over point around pH 5. 2, above which the <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients</b> decrease with increasing ionic strength, indicating the presence of attractive electrostatic interactions. The data are in agreement with Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) -type modeling, accounting for the repulsive and attractive electrostatic, van der Waals, and excluded volume interactions of equivalent colloid spheres. This model, however, is unable to resolve the complex short-ranged orientational interactions. The results of protein precipitation and crystallization experiments are in qualitative correlation with the patterns of the <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients</b> and demonstrate that interaction mapping could help outline new crystallization regions...|$|R
