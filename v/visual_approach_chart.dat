40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of different instrument <b>approach</b> <b>charts</b> to deliver minimum visibility and altitude information during airport equipment outages was investigated. Eighteen pilots flew simulated instrument approaches in three conditions: (a) normal operations using a standard <b>approach</b> <b>chart</b> (standard-normal), (b) equipment outage conditions using a standard <b>approach</b> <b>chart</b> (standard-outage), and (c) equipment outage conditions using a prototype de-cluttered <b>approach</b> <b>chart</b> (prototype-outage). Errors and retrieval times in identifying minimum altitudes and visibilities were measured. The standard-outage condition produced significantly more errors and longer retrieval times {{compared to the}} standard-normal condition. The prototype-outage condition had significantly fewer errors and shorter retrieval times than did the standard-outage condition. The prototype-outage condition produced significantly fewer errors but similar retrieval times compared to the standard-normal condition. Thus, changing the presentation of minimums may reduce risk and increase safety in instrument approaches, specifically with airport equipment outages...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>visual</b> <b>approach</b> {{allows a}} pilot {{to fly to}} the runway without having to perform an {{instrument}} approach. [...] This can greatly reduce pilot and controller workload, and expedite traffic by shortening flight paths to the airport. [...] Taking a shorter route to the airport in lieu of flying a complicated instrument approach procedure (IAP) can increase pilot safety, as the critical tasks of approach and landing occur when pilots are most fatigued. Controllers also benefit from <b>visual</b> <b>approaches,</b> for whom a <b>visual</b> <b>approach</b> is an essential tool {{in the effort to}} maximize traffic flow (especially at busy airports). <b>Visual</b> <b>approaches</b> dramatically reduce controller workload—ATC's IFR separation requirements are eliminated which relieves controllers of the burden.|$|R

Useful, nonexcessive safety alerts on aircraft conducting <b>visual</b> <b>approaches</b> are helpful to air traffic controllers, though pilots are responsible for separation with the preceding aircraft.

40|$|Adequately {{presenting}} {{all necessary}} information on an <b>approach</b> <b>chart</b> represents {{a challenge for}} cartographers. Since many tasks associated with using <b>approach</b> <b>charts</b> are cognitive (e. g., planning the approach and monitoring its progress), and since the characteristic of a successful interface is one that conforms to the users' mental models, understanding pilots' underlying models of <b>approach</b> <b>chart</b> information would greatly assist cartographers. To provide such information, a new methodology was developed for this study that enhances traditional information requirements analyses by combining psychometric scaling techniques with a simulation task to provide quantifiable links between pilots' cognitive representations of approach information and their use of approach information. Results of this study should augment previous information requirements analyses by identifying what information is acquired, when it is acquired, and what presentation concepts might facilitate its efficient use by better matching the pilots' cognitive model of the information. The primary finding in this study indicated that pilots mentally organize <b>approach</b> <b>chart</b> information into ten primary categories: communications, geography, validation, obstructions, navigation, missed approach, final items, other runways, visibility requirement, and navigation aids. These similarity categories were found to underlie the pilots' information acquisitions, other mental models, and higher level cognitive processes {{that are used to}} accomplish their approach and landing tasks...|$|R

Over 200 <b>visual</b> <b>approaches</b> were flown using different helicopter types, test subjects, and initial conditions, and the altitude and groundspeed profiles were measured by a precision tracking radar. The data from each approach were then processed, and the characteristic shape of the altitude, groundspeed, and deceleration profiles was determined for each set of initial conditions. These flight data were processed further using graphical analysis techniques and parameterization, which, in turn, led to developing closed-form equations that accurately describe the characteristic groundspeed and deceleration profiles. Results from this study can be used to select instrument approach profiles, to develop instrument approach control laws, and to define the corresponding hardware requirements...|$|R
