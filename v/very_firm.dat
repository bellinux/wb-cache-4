Waqar again transgressed and Shepherd ordered his removal from the attack becoming the first umpire to have taken such an action during an international match.|$|E

Peking's YWCA successfully established a mother's club for women coming from lower income families. At the same time, Phillips pushed the creation of a Home Training School in which students would learn care for the sick, cleanliness, and a number of other simple tasks.

30|$|We run {{the same}} OLS {{regressions}} shown in Table 2. If the workload hypothesis has some empirical relevance, {{then we should}} see a stronger relationship between absenteeism and unemployment in firms just below the 15 -threshold (more reluctant to hire new employees to avoid to reach the threshold) than in <b>very</b> small <b>firms.</b> However, the results reported in Table 5 show no evidence supporting the workload hypothesis. In particular, in columns (1) and (2) the coefficient on the interaction Small firm (11 – 15 employees) × Unemployment shows that unemployment has no differential impact between <b>very</b> small <b>firms</b> and small firms (the interaction term is not statistically significant and has the wrong sign). When we consider the entire sample in columns (3) and (4), the coefficients have to be interpreted {{with respect to the}} omitted category (Very small firm: 5 – 10 employees). Consistently with the results in Table 2, we find that workers in <b>very</b> small <b>firms</b> react more negatively to unemployment than workers in large firms (- 0.045 in <b>very</b> small <b>firms</b> vs - 0.031 = - 0.045 + 0.014 in large firms), while again we find no evidence of a differential impact of unemployment for workers in <b>very</b> small <b>firms</b> with respect to workers in small firms. Although theoretically plausible, our estimates show that the workload hypothesis is not empirically relevant. This could be {{explained by the fact that}} firms might react to the business cycle by resorting to temporary help firms (that are not recorded in our data) and not by significantly increasing the workload of workers.|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the Temple of Pluto is located near Septimius Severus’ triumphal arch in an area of the city that has only been partially excavated as yet, but this hypothesis is not <b>very</b> <b>firm</b> and is based on the discovery of a bust in a courtyard, which has been dated by Claude Poinssot to the 2nd or 3rd century CE. The associated building was excavated in the 1960s but {{little is known about the}} manner in which the excavation was conducted and the stabilisation work carried out at the site.

25|$|Nicklaus {{was also}} known for his course {{management}} skills. He would plan to hit each full shot to the optimal position, to best set up his next shot, usually aiming for level lies and clear approach lines, while favoring his preferred shot shapes. He would often hold back on power to achieve this, but had a power advantage over most rivals through the set, {{so that he could}} hit a 3-wood or 1-iron from the tee with increased accuracy to avoid trouble, with sufficient length {{to keep up with the}} drivers hit by most rivals. An exceptional example of this came in the final round of the 1966 Open Championship at Muirfield, on the 17th hole, a 530-yard par 5 hole. Nicklaus needed a birdie, but the hole was framed by tall fescue rough, and was playing downwind with <b>very</b> <b>firm</b> turf conditions. He used a 3-iron from the tee and hit the shot 290 yards, then hit a 5-iron 240 yards onto the green, two-putted for birdie, and parred the final hole to win the title.|$|E

500|$|The {{pages with}} the text have been ruled with a blind stylus or similar tool, leaving just an {{impression}} in the vellum.

[...] Impressed lines mark the vertical edges of the text area, {{and there is an}} outer pair of lines. [...] Each line of text is ruled, only as far as the inner vertical lines, and there are prick marks where the horizontal lines meet the verticals. [...] The book begins with 19 lines on a page, but at folio 42 changes to 20 lines per page, requiring the re-ruling of some pages. [...] This change was evidently a departure from the original plan, and may have been caused by a shortage of the very fine vellum, as two different sorts are used, though the change does not coincide exactly with the change in the number of lines.|$|E

30|$|The {{definition}} of informality and formality matters for {{the estimation of}} returns to sector tenure. Specifically, we find that firm size {{is not a very}} good proxy for formality. It is true that firm size is highly predictive of benefit provision, with larger firms more likely to provide benefits, but there are still plenty of small firms that are formal and large firms that are informal if informality is defined according to health benefit provision. Indeed, among observations used to estimate regressions underlying column 4 (Table 8), we find that 14 % of <b>very</b> small <b>firms</b> (4 workers or fewer) provide health benefits and are therefore formal according to this definition, while 22 % of <b>very</b> large <b>firms</b> (100 workers or more) do not provide health benefits and are therefore informal.|$|R
