40|$|Up to 15 % of {{children}} with Down syndrome have atlanto-axial instability (AAI) due to constitutional ligament hyperlaxity. Symptomatic disease occurs in 3 % of patients: most frequently neurological symptoms of spinal cord compression slowly progress over time but complications from <b>vertebral</b> <b>dislocation</b> can manifest with sudden painful torticollis. While asymptomatic cases require no intervention, symptomatic cases {{are at risk for}} irreversible neurological damage and require prompt recognition and surgical stabilization of cervical spine. The paper describes the case of a 10 -year-old girl with Down syndrome and AAI who presented with painful torticollis caused by rotatory dislocation of C 1 -C 2. Torticollis was initially misdiagnosed as myogenic. <b>Vertebral</b> <b>dislocation</b> was recognized one month after the onset of symptoms and appropriately managed with surgical stabilization of cervical spine...|$|E

40|$|Age-related {{degenerative}} {{changes within}} the vertebral column {{are a significant}} cause of morbidity with considerable socio-economic impact worldwide. An improved understanding of these changes {{through the development of}} experimental models may lead to improvements in existing clinical treatment options. The zebrafish is a well-established model for the study of skeletogenesis with significant potential in gerontological research. With advancing age, zebrafish frequently develop gross deformities of their vertebral column, previously ascribed to reduced trunk muscle tone. In this study, wd assess degenerative changes specifically within the bone and cartilage of the vertebral column of zebrafish at 1, 2 and 3 -years of age. We show increased frequency and severity of spinal deformities/curvatures with age. Underlying the most severe phenotypes are partial or complete <b>vertebral</b> <b>dislocations</b> and focal thickening of the vertebral bone at the joint margins. MicroCT examination demonstrates small defects, fractures and morphological evidence suggestive of bone erosion and remodeling (i. e. osteophytes) within the vertebrae during aging, but no significant change in bone density. Light and electron microscopic examination reveal striking age-related changes in cell morphology, suggestive of chondroptosis, and tissue remodelling of the vertebral cartilage, particularly within the pericellular micro-environment. Glycosaminoglycan analysis of the vertebral column by HPLC demonstrates a consistent, age-related increase in the yield of total chondroitin sulfate disaccharide, but no change in sulfation pattern, supported by immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemistry strongly identifies all three chondroitin/dermatan sulphate isoforms (C- 0 -S, C- 4 -S/DS and C- 6 -S) within the vertebral cartilage, particularly within the pericellular micro-environment. In contrast, keratan sulfate immunolocalises specifically with the notochordal tissue of the intervertebral disc, and its labelling diminishes with age. In summary, these observations raise the prospect that zebrafish, in addition to modelling skeletal development, may have utility in modelling age-related degenerative changes that affect the skeleton during senescence...|$|R
50|$|The Toftness Radiation Detector is an {{instrument}} used by certain doctors of chiropractic. It {{was invented by}} Dr. Irving N. Toftness. It is a diagnostic tool roughly analogous to a stethoscope used by a medical doctor, except {{that it does not}} touch the patient. The device detects a specific electromagnetic radiation frequency which emanates from <b>vertebral</b> subluxations (small <b>dislocations).</b> It helps the doctor determine the location of the injury, and allows him to use minimal force to adjust the spine and return it to proper alignment. Perhaps most importantly, the Detector allows the doctor to make very precise adjustments, since the radiation stops immediately when the subluxation is corrected.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Spinal cord {{compression}} and associate neurological impairment {{is rare in}} patients with scoliosis and neurofibromatosis. Common reasons are <b>vertebral</b> subluxation, <b>dislocation,</b> angulation and tumorous lesions around the spinal canal. Only twelve cases of intraspinal rib dislocation {{have been reported in}} the literature. The aim of this report is to present a case of rib penetration through neural foramen at the apex of a scoliotic curve in neurofibromatosis and to introduce a new clinical sign for its detection. Methods A 13 -year-old girl was evaluated for progressive left thoracic kyphoscoliotic curve due to a type I neurofibromatosis. Clinical examination revealed multiple large thoracic and abdominal "cafe-au-lait" spots, neurological impairment of the lower limbs and the presence of a thoracic gibbous that was painful to pressure at the level of the left eighth rib (Painful Rib Hump). CT-scan showed detachment and translocation of the cephalic end of the left eighth rib into the adjacent enlarged neural foramen. The M. R. I. examination of the spine showed neither cord abnormality nor neurogenic tumor. Results The patient underwent resection of the intraspinal mobile eighth rib head and posterior spinal instrumentation and was neurologically fully recovered six months postoperatively. Conclusion Spine surgeons should be aware of intraspinal rib displacement in scoliotic curves in neurofibromatosis. Painful rib hump is a valuable diagnostic tool for this rare clinical entity. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{risks and}} clinical effects of operative treatment for cervical <b>vertebral</b> fracture and <b>dislocation</b> associated with unilateral vertebral artery injury. MethodsThis {{group consisted of}} 76 cases of closed cervical spine trauma combined with unilateral vertebral artery injury (23 cases of bilateral facet dislocation, 28 unilateral facet dislocation and 25 fracture). All patients underwent prospective examination of cervical spine MRI and vertebral artery two-dimensional time-of-flight (2 D TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and anterior cervical decompression. The healthy vertebral artery paths were evaluated before the surgery, and were protected during the surgery according to the anatomical signs. ResultsThere were no acute or chronic clinical damage symptoms in 76 cases after surgery. No neural damage symptoms were observed in patients with normal neural functions. The neural functions of incomplete paralyzed patients were improved in different grades. ConclusionReliable anterior operation can produce good results for cervical fracture and <b>dislocation</b> with unilateral <b>vertebral</b> artery injury.

40|$|Chylothorax {{represents}} an uncommon clinical entity with multiple etiologies. Chylothorax following bluntthoracic trauma is {{typically associated with}} posterior rib fractures or thoracic <b>vertebral</b> fractures or <b>dislocations.</b> The occurrence of a traumatic chylothorax {{in the absence of}} associated injuries is a rare event. We reporta case of a 51 -year-old patient who developed bilateral chylothorax after sustaining blunt trauma withoutradiographic evidence of traumatic injury. A 51 -year-old male presented to the emergency departmentcomplaining of progressively worsening shortness of breath and associated chest pain for the prior one weekfollowing a fall down several concrete steps. On evaluation, the patient was found to have bilateral pleuraleffusions with no radiographic evidence of traumatic injury, including posterior rib or thoracic vertebral fractures. Subsequent thoracentesis and pleural fluid analysis were performed confirming the diagnosis of chylothorax. Management included repeated thoracentesis, diet modification and octreotide administration, which resultedin dramatic improvement and eventual resolution of symptoms. Non-iatrogenic traumatic bilateral chylothoraxin the absence of other radiographically demonstrated bony or soft tissue injury is a rare event.

40|$|Thoracolumbar disk {{disease is}} a {{condition}} associated with spinal cord compression {{that leads to the}} extrusion of the nucleus pulposus of an intervertebral disk. It can cause mild pain to very severe symptoms including complete paralysis of the pelvic limbs. The treatment for this disease depends on the location and severity of the compression. The objective {{of this study was to}} use pediculectomy surgery technique, for spinal decompression, on a seven-year-old female dog that was a mixed breed, suffered from pelvic limb paresis, and was diagnosed with dorsolateral thoracolumbar disk disease. A disk fenestration was also performed in the area to prevent the recurrence of the symtoms. The pediculectomy technique involves creating a slot in the lateral area of the vertebras to preserve the articular facets. Thirty days after the surgery the patient was walking normally. The pediculectomy technique is a good surgical option because it promotes decompression, and extruded material can be removed, which leads to less instability decreases the chance of <b>vertebral</b> <b>dislocation</b> and allows disk fenestration to be performed during the same surgical period. Pediculectomy was effective in the treatment of this patient...|$|E
40|$|Spinal {{cord injury}} {{occurring}} without concomitant radiologically demonstrable {{trauma to the}} skeletal elements of the spinal canal rim, or compromise of the spinal canal rim without fracture, is a rare event. Though documented in children, the injury is not very well reported in adults. We present seventeen adult patients {{with spinal cord injury}} without accompanying fracture of the spinal canal rim, or <b>vertebral</b> <b>dislocation,</b> seen over seven years. None had preexisting spinal canal stenosis or cervical spondylosis. Following trauma, these patients had weakness of all four limbs. They were evaluated by MRI (CT scan in one patient), which showed hypo / isointense lesion in the cord on T 1 weighted images, and hyperintensity on T 2 weighted images, suggesting cord contusion or oedema. MRI was normal in two patients. With conservative management, fifteen patients showed neurological improvement, one remained quadriplegic and one died. With increasing use of MRI in the evaluation of traumatic myelopathy, such injuries will be diagnosed more often. The mechanism of injury is probably acute stretching of the cord as in flexion and torsional strain. Management is essentially conservative and prognosis is better than that seen in patients with fracture or dislocation of cervical spine...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAir in the {{epidural}} {{space is}} called pneumorachis. The usual mechanism of pneumorachis is air diffusion from the mediastinal tissue layers through the inter-vertebral foramen. Alternatively, air can diffuse directly after spine traumas (e. g., blunt deceleration with <b>vertebral</b> <b>dislocation)</b> or medical procedures. Several mechanisms could explain pneumomediastinum and pneumorachis after cocaine sniffing. Passive apnea and/or cough that occur after sniffing can cause intra alveolar hyper-pressure, {{which is responsible}} for alveolar rupture and air diffusion. Another mechanism is alveolar wall fragility and rupture induced by repeated cocaine sniffing, in turn causing air diffusion to the mediastinum, sub-cutaneous tissues and the epidural space. The diagnosis is usually made on Chest tomography scan. Management consists in close monitoring {{in the intensive care unit}} to detect aggravation of pneumomediastinum and pneumorachis, which would require surgical management. Supplemental nasal oxygen can be given to accelerate nitrogen washout. We present a case of a 28 years old male who presented to the emergency department for chest pain directly after sniffing cocaine. A computed tomography scan of the chest showed pneumomediastinum, pneumorachis and sub-cutaneous emphysema. The patient was admitted for 24  h: after that delay, surveillance chest tomodensitometry showed stability, and he could be discharged without further treatment...|$|E
40|$|We {{recently}} {{reported on the}} deficiency of carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3 (CHST 3, chondroitin- 6 -sulfotransferase) in six subjects diagnosed with recessive Larsen syndrome or humero -spinal dysostosis [Hermanns et al. (2008), Am J Hum Genet 82 : 1368 - 1374]. Since then, we have identified 17 additional families with CHST 3 mutations and we report here {{on a series of}} 24 Patients in 23 families. The diagnostic hypothesis prior to molecular analysis had been: Larsen syndrome (15 families), humero-spinal dysostosis (four cases), chondrodysplasia with multiple dislocations (CDMD 2 ̆ 2 Megarbane type 2 ̆ 2, two cases), Desbuquois syndrome (one case), and spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia (one case). In spite of the different diagnostic labels, the clinical features in these Patients were similar and included dislocation of the knees and/or hips at birth, clubfoot, elbow joint dysplasia with subluxation and limited extension, short stature, and progressive kyphosis developing in late childhood. The most useful radiographic clues were the changes of the lumbar vertebrae. Twenty-four different CHST 3 mutations were identified, 16 Patients had homozygous mutations. We conclude that CHST 3 deficiency presents at birth with congenital dislocations of knees, hips, and elbows, and is often diagnosed initially as Larsen syndrome, humero-spinal dysostosis, or chondrodysplasia with dislocations. The incidence of CHST 3 deficiency seems to be higher than assumed so far. The clinical and radiographic pattern (joint <b>dislocations,</b> <b>vertebral</b> changes, normal carpal age, lack of facial flattening, and recessive inheritance) is characteristic and distinguishes CHST 3 deficiency from other disorders with congenital dislocations such as filamin B-associated dominant Larsen syndrome and Desbuquois syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to observe {{autophagy}} in chondrocytes from degenerative human cervical vertebral end‑plates and to investigate the significance of variations in autophagy in the degeneration of cervical vertebral end-plate chondrocytes. Cartilage end-plates were obtained from 48 inpatients admitted to hospital between February 2011 and August 2012. The patients were divided into the control group (n= 17) with cervical <b>vertebral</b> fracture or <b>dislocation</b> and the cervical spondylosis group (n= 31) with cervical spondylotic myelopathy. End-plate chondrocytes were isolated via enzyme digestion and then cultured in vitro. The cells were stained with toluidine blue and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E). A laser scanning confocal microscope and monodansylcadaverine (MDC) were used to reveal autophagy in the end-plate chondrocytes. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect mRNA expression of type II collagen and aggrecan. Western blotting was conducted to detect LC 3 proteins. The chondrocytes isolated from the degenerative human cervical end-plates were cultured successfully in vitro. The morphology of the cells from the cervical spondylosis group tended to exhibit changes in spindle morphology compared with the control group. Autophagic bodies were stained with MDC. LC 3 proteins were visible in the intracellular and peri-nuclear regions under the laser scanning confocal microscope. The mRNA expression levels (relative to those of β-actin) of aggrecan (0. 715 ± 0. 194) and type II collagen (0. 628 ± 0. 254) in the cervical spondylosis group were markedly decreased compared with those in the control group (0. 913 ± 0. 254 and 0. 845 ± 0. 186, respectively; both P< 0. 05). The LC 3 -II/LC 3 -I ratio was observed to be significantly reduced in the cervical spondylosis group by Western blot analysis. Autophagy has an important role in human cervical disc degeneration. The regu-lation of autophagy may prevent disc degeneration in cartilage end-plate cells...|$|R
40|$|STUDY DESIGN. A case report. OBJECTIVE. To raise {{awareness}} {{of the development of}} atlantoaxial rotatory fixation (AARF) in the setting of congenital vertebral anomalies/malformations. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Klippel-Feil Syndrome (KFS) is a complex, heterogeneous condition noted as congenital fusion of 2 or more cervical vertebrae with or without spinal or extraspinal manifestations. Although believed to be a rare occurrence in the population, KFS may be underreported. Proper diagnosis of KFS and other congenital conditions affecting the spine is imperative to devise proper management protocols and avoid potential complications resulting from the altered biomechanics associated with such conditions and their abnormal <b>vertebral</b> morphology. Craniovertebral <b>dislocation</b> and AARF may cause severe cervicomedullary and spinal cord compression and could thereby be potentially fatal, especially in patients with KFS who present with congenitally-associated comorbidities. METHODS. A 13 -year-old boy with Chiari type I malformation, craniofacial abnormalities, and other irregularities underwent thoracolumbar spine surgery for his scoliosis curve correction at another institution, which immediately following surgery he became a quadriparetic. The initial preoperative assessment of his cervical spine was limited and the associated KFS was initially undiagnosed. At 14 years of age, he presented to our clinic with an ASIA-C spinal cord injury. Plain radiographs, normal and 3 -dimensional reformatted computed tomographs (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) noted assimilation of the patient's occiput to the atlas (occipitalization) with congenital fusion of C 2 -C 3, indicative of KFS, and the presence of anterior craniovertebral dislocation with a Fielding and Hawkins type II AARF. Closed reduction of the craniovertebral dislocation was noted, but his atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation was nonresponsive and fixed (AARF). As such, at the age of 14, the patient underwent posterior instrumentation and fusion from the occiput to C 4 to maintain reduction of thecraniovertebral dislocation and reduce his AARF. RESULTS. At 9 months postoperative follow-up of his craniovertebral surgery, the instrumentation remained intact, reduction of the atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation was maintained, and posterior bone fusion was noted. Neurologically, he remained an ASIA-C without any substantial return of function. CONCLUSION. This report raises awareness for the need of a thorough evaluation of the cervical spine to determine patients at high risk for craniovertebral dislocation and atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation, primarily in the context of KFS or other congenital conditions. Three-dimensional CT and MR imaging are ideal radiographic methods to determine the presence and extent of craniovertebral dislocation, AARF, and of abnormal vertebral anatomy/malformations. In addition, the authors propose a modification to the Fielding and Hawkins classification of AARF to include variants and subtypes that account for abnormal anatomy and congenital anomalies/malformations. © 2010 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|A unique case of pseudo-aneurysm of a lumbar artery after injury of the thoracolumbar spine was presented. Injury of a lumbar artery {{represents}} a potential cause of massive, life-threatening, retroperitoneal bleeding. It {{may be associated}} with lesions of the abdomen, lower limbs, pelvic bones, and spinal column. Fracture of a transverse process may be responsible for direct laceration of a lumbar artery, but formation of a pseudo-aneurysm is an uncommon event. The diagnosis is difficult and often delayed.

40|$|We report {{results in}} the {{surgical}} treatment of thoracolumbar flexion–distraction fractures, both associated or not with neurological impairment. Items {{in the present study}} include function, pain (back pain rating scale) and neurological recovery (Asia Score). A prospective series of 19 consecutive flexion–extension thoracolumbar injuries (T 11 –L 2), occurred in young patients (20 – 33  years) due to motor vehicle crashes wearing the 3 -point safety belts, includes 2 Chance and 17 seat-belt fractures, with different amount of <b>vertebral</b> <b>dislocation</b> and neurological impairment. Fractures have been evaluated according to the Magerl’s classification. All patients were operated via posterior approach using hybrid instrumentation or short pedicular fixation to reduce dislocation and to obtain spinal fusion. Posterior decompression was performed in all patients with neurological deficit. Posterior instrumented arthodesis was performed by wide constructs that preferably include 2 levels above and below the dislocated vertebra. Most of them were instrumented using thoracic hooks and lumbar pedicular screws. One postoperative vascular complication was successfully treated by selective embolization. All neurological patients were submitted to a postoperative rehabilitation program. Posterior procedure allows proper reduction and realignment. In our experience, the use of laminar hooks one level above the dislocation seems to reduce the potential risk of neurological and /or vascular damage during the intraoperative maneuvers on the dislocated pedicles. At follow-up, fusion was achieved in all patients. The clinical condition was totally satisfactory due to the absence of significant pain, confirming mechanical stability of the implants. In terms of neurological outcomes, patients presenting as ASIA A-B or ASIA E, maintained their preoperative neurological condition. Surgical treatment, together with an early postoperative rehabilitation program, can be of paramount importance in neurological patients’ quality of life...|$|E
40|$|The present {{series of}} {{experiments}} was undertaken to study the neoplastic potentialities of embryonic tissue, under normal conditions and under influence of carcinogens and other chemicals. This work was the outgrowth of {{an interest in the}} problem of the origin of the malignant cell in the adult, and an investigation of the stages in development during which cells may become neoplastic. $ MATERIALS Mice four to six weeks of age of strains A, C, CBA, CsH, and C 67 black were used, chiefly because these strains are notably homogeneous. Embryonic tissues used for subcutaneous grafts were limited to tissues from strains A, C, and CBA. Six mice were placed in each cage, and all mice were maintained on stock laboratory chow ("Nurishmix") and water ad libitum. The temperature of the animal rooms was constant at 720 F. Embryonic lung, liver, and gut tissues were obtained from 15 - 20 -day-old embryos and transplanted subcutaneously in the axillary region. Although the exact age of each litter was not determined, in many cases the gestation period was calculated by the vaginal plug method, and in some instances, the age was estimated by crown-to-rump measurements of the embryo. Hysterectomy was performed after each pregnant mouse was killed by cervical <b>vertebral</b> <b>dislocation.</b> The uterus and embryos were placed immediately in a petri dish moistened with isotonic saline to minimize desiccation. Each fetus was removed separately from the uterine wall and decapitated immediately after rupture of the amniotic sac. The lungs were excised and kept moist with isotonic saline solution. From each embryo it was usually possible to obtain four small pieces of tissue for implantation immediately after removal. The same transplantation procedure was used from embryonic liver and gut tissues. A small piece of tissue, about one cubic millimeter in size, was placed in a 13 -gauge trocar and subsequently transplanted into the axillary region of the host. Most animals received two transplants, one on each side. Homologous (to the same strain) and heterologous (to a different strain) transplants were made in each case.
