40|$|ABSTRACT. A 9 -year-old {{female dog}} was {{referred}} to Azabu University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for dysuria and dyschezia after ovar-iohysterectomy. After a series of diagnostic imaging, vaginal obstruction was suspected by vaginal fluid retention. Surgical repair was attempted three times to establish patency through the vagina and the vestibule by episiotomy and laparotomy. Another laparotomy was performed to remove the entire vaginal mucosal layer to prevent recurrence, which resulted in favorable outcome. Histopathological exami-nation revealed that the resected tissue was a cyst originated from mesonephric duct remnant. In the present case, the cyst was curable by the entire resection of the cyst lining membrane, which could eradicate all the secretory cells with least damage to the urethral vasculature and innervation.

40|$|Introduction. Aggressive angiomyxoma {{is a rare}} mesenchymal neoplasm. Although benign in the {{majority}} of the cases, these neoplasms usually present a locally infiltrative nature and high rates of recurrence. Due to its rarity, misdiagnosis is a common problem. Case Presentation. We present one case of aggressive angiomyxoma in a 25 -year-old pregnant woman. The patient presented with a large vaginal mass that was interpreted as a <b>vaginal</b> <b>cyst.</b> We performed surgical resection of the neoplasm and the correct diagnosis was only achieved after histological examination. With this case, we highlight the importance of considering this diagnosis in patients with genital and perineal masses of unknown origin and the impact of a correct preoperative diagnosis in patient’s management and follow-up. Conclusion. Although aggressive angiomyxoma is rare, it should be considered in differential diagnosis of pelviperineal masses in young women. Its positivity to estrogen and progesterone receptors can justify enlargement and recurrence during pregnancy, although few cases are reported. Early recognition demands high index of suspicion for both gynaecologists and pathologists. Wide surgical excision with tumor free margins is the basis of curative treatment. Adjuvant therapy may be necessary for residual or recurrent tumors. Long-term follow-up is recommended...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{ultrasound}} imaging in urogynecology is not clearly defined. Despite significant developments in visualization techniques {{and interpretation of}} images, pelvic ultrasound is still more a tool for research than for clinical practice. Structures of the lower genitourinary tract and pelvic floor can be visualized from different approaches: transperineal, introital, transvaginal, abdominal or endoanal. According to contemporary guidelines and recommendations, the role of ultrasound in urogynecology {{is limited to the}} measurement of post-void residue. However, in many instances, including planning and audit of surgical procedures, management of recurrences or complications, ultrasound may be proposed as the initial examination of choice. Ultrasound may be used for assessment of bladder neck mobility before anti-incontinence procedures. On rare occasions it is helpful in recognition of pathologies mimicking vaginal prolapse such as <b>vaginal</b> <b>cyst,</b> urethral diverticula or rectal intussusception. In patients subjected to suburethral slings, causes of surgery failure or postsurgical voiding dysfunctions can be revealed by imaging. Many reports link the location of a tape close to the bladder neck to unfavorable outcomes of sling surgery. Some postoperative complications, such as urinary retention, mesh malposition, hematoma, or urinary tract injury, can be diagnosed by ultrasound. On the other hand, the clinical value of some applications of ultrasound in urogynecology, for example measurement of the bladder wall thickness as a marker of detrusor overactivity, has not been proved...|$|E
40|$|We used human vaginal mucosa to {{establish}} an experimental non-keratinized cyst in immunodeficient mice and demonstrated {{that it could be}} used as a biotest model. Because the histology of vaginal and buccal mucosa is broadly similar and the permeability of vaginal epithelium to water and 17 β-estradiol is comparable to that of buccal mucosa, we concluded that these features indicate that the cyst could also be used for investigating the pathogenesis of various oral mucosal pathoses. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to compare the permeability of the epithelium lining the experimental cyst with that of fresh vaginal epithelium. Fresh vaginal mucosa was obtained from six postmenopausal women who had undergone reconstructive vaginal surgery. Seven tissue disks were prepared from each of the vaginal specimens, mounted in flow-through diffusion cells and their permeability to tritiated water determined as previously described. Six artificial cysts were constructed from an additional six specimens, implanted in nude mice and harvested after nine weeks.

40|$|Magister Scientiae (Medical Bioscience) - MSc(MBS) Athymic {{nude mouse}} {{models have been}} {{extensively}} used to study biological behaviour of normal and diseased human tissues. In such models, immune-deficient mice act as hosts for cysts constructed from human material. A unique biocyst model that entails transplantation of human <b>vaginal</b> <b>cysts</b> into athymic nude mice has been implemented to study diseases of oral mucosa. To date, only one immunohistochemical study of this biocyst model has been reported. Nevertheless, conclusions made in that study were only based on the observed expression patterns of human and murine markers. Statistical assessment of immunohistochemical data had been omitted by the investigator. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to further delineate the immunohistochemical profile of normal human vaginal tissue and human vaginal tissue that had been xenografted into nude mice. Experimental cysts constructed from human vaginal mucosa were xenografted into athymic nude mice and harvested 9 -weeks post transplantation. Immunohistochemical analysis of normal human vaginal tissue and human vaginal tissue that had been xenografted into nude mice was performed using a panel of human and murine markers. Expression patterns of human and murine markers were assessed. Human markers included cytokeratin 1,cytokeratin 5, cytokeratin 13, cytokeratin 14, collagen type IV, laminin, elastin, fibronectin,Langerhans cells and VEGFR- 3. Murine markers included collagen type IV, laminin,fibronectin, Langerhans cells and VEGFR- 2. Staining intensities were quantified and statistically analysed using one-way ANOVA with subsequent Friedman’s test for multiple comparisons. Since the sample size was small, the power of the test statistic was enhanced by including Dunn’s post-test for further multiple comparisons. A strong positive expression of all cytokeratins was detected in both normal and xenografted vaginal tissues. Human markers that exhibited weak to moderate positive expression were collagen IV, laminin, fibronectin and VEGFR- 3. Human elastin and human Langerhans cells exhibited strong and varying expression patterns respectively. Weak expression patterns for all murine markers were reported, with an exception of VEGFR- 2 which was negatively expressed in all xenografted vaginal tissues. Significant differences (P 0. 05) in the mean staining intensities for other markers. In conclusion, immunohistochemical studies proved that human vaginal tissue could not only survive in nude mice, but could also become active and develop structures necessary for survival, in this case, a newly formed stromal layer.

40|$|A rat {{model of}} endometriosis, in which pieces of uterine horn (versus fat in controls) are autotransplanted into the abdomen where they form cysts, reduces {{fecundity}} and produces <b>vaginal</b> hyperalgesia. The <b>cysts</b> gradually enlarge over a 2 -month period postsurgically and then plateau. Cysts regress with low estrogen levels and reappear when they rise. Based on {{the hypothesis that}} the vaginal hyperalgesia depends upon the cysts, this study tested two predictions: that (1) the hyperalgesia would develop postsurgically in parallel with the cysts, and (2) the hyperalgesia would vary with estrous, being greatest when estrogen levels are high (proestrus) and least when low (estrus). In rats trained to escape vaginal distention, percentage escape responses to different distention volumes were measured across the rat’s 4 -day estrous cycle for 2. 5 months before and up to 4 months after autotransplantation of uterus (n 9) or fat (n 6) in abdominal sites. Vaginal pressures were also measured. In rats with uterine but not fat autotransplants, escape percentages increased postsurgically over a 2 -month period and then plateaued. The increase was greatest in proestrus and failed to occur in estrus. Vaginal pressures were unchanged in all groups. These results strongly support {{the hypothesis that the}} vaginal hyperalgesia depends upon the cysts. Because the cysts were located in sites remote from the vagina, the hyperalgesia involves viscero-visceral interactions and is likely centrally mediated, whereas the estrous modulation could involve hormonal actions either on the cysts or, more likely, on vaginal afferent fibers, and/or on central neurons...|$|R
