5|$|All {{vanadium}} compounds {{should be}} considered toxic. Tetravalent VOSO4 {{has been reported to}} be at least 5 times more toxic than trivalent V2O3. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set an exposure limit of 0.05 mg/m3 for <b>vanadium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> dust and 0.1 mg/m3 for <b>vanadium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> fumes in workplace air for an 8-hour workday, 40-hour work week. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that 35 mg/m3 of vanadium be considered immediately dangerous to life and health, that is, likely to cause permanent health problems or death.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{carnotite}} and roscoelite, vanadinite {{is one of}} {{the main}} industrial ores of the element vanadium, which can be extracted by roasting and smelting. Vanadinite is also occasionally used as a source of lead. A common process for extracting the vanadium begins with the heating of vanadinite with salt (NaCl) or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) at about 850°C to produce sodium vanadate (NaVO3). This is dissolved in water and then treated with ammonium chloride to give an orange-coloured precipitate of ammonium metavanadate. This is then melted to form a crude form of <b>vanadium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> (V2O5). Reduction of <b>vanadium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> with calcium gives pure vanadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{isolation}} of vanadium metal proved difficult. In 1831, Berzelius reported {{the production of}} the metal, but Henry Enfield Roscoe showed that Berzelius had in fact produced the nitride, vanadium nitride (VN). Roscoe eventually produced the metal in 1867 by reduction of vanadium(II) chloride, VCl2, with hydrogen. In 1927, pure vanadium was produced by reducing <b>vanadium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> with calcium.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} that vanadium or vanadium compounds are reproductive toxins or teratogens. <b>Vanadium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> was reported to be carcinogenic in male rats and in male and female mice by inhalation in an NTP study, although the interpretation of the results has recently been disputed. The carcinogenicity of vanadium has not been determined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium occurs {{naturally}} in about 65 different minerals and in fossil fuel deposits. It {{is produced in}} China and Russia from steel smelter slag; other countries produce it either from the flue dust of heavy oil, or as a byproduct of uranium mining. It is mainly used to produce specialty steel alloys such as high-speed tool steels. The most important industrial vanadium compound, <b>vanadium</b> <b>pentoxide,</b> {{is used as a}} catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{essential}} for {{life can be}} toxic if taken in excess; some have notably toxic forms. <b>Vanadium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> (V2O5) is carcinogenic in animals and, when inhaled, causes DNA damage. The purple permanganate ion MnO is a liver and kidney poison. Ingesting more than 0.5 grams of iron can induce cardiac collapse; such overdoses most commonly occur in children and may result in death within 24 hours. Nickel carbonyl (Ni2(CO)4), at 30 parts per million, can cause respiratory failure, brain damage and death. Imbibing a gram or more of copper sulfate (Cu(SO4)2) can be fatal; survivors may be left with major organ damage. More than five milligrams of selenium is highly toxic; this is roughly ten times the 0.45 milligram recommended maximum daily intake; long-term poisoning can have paralytic effects.|$|E

25|$|Nickel (Ni), {{vanadium}} (V), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) {{and others}} metals frequently occur in oils.

500|$|The {{most common}} oxide of vanadium, <b>vanadium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> V2O5, {{is used as}} a {{catalyst}} in manufacturing sulfuric acid by the contact process and as an oxidizer in maleic anhydride production. <b>Vanadium</b> <b>pentoxide</b> is used in ceramics. [...] Vanadium is an important component of mixed metal oxide catalysts used in the oxidation of propane and propylene to acrolein, acrylic acid or the ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile. In service, the oxidation state of vanadium changes dynamically and reversibly with the oxygen and the steam content of the reacting feed mixture. [...] Another oxide of vanadium, vanadium dioxide VO2, is used in the production of glass coatings, which blocks infrared radiation (and not visible light) at a specific temperature. Vanadium oxide can be used to induce color centers in corundum to create simulated alexandrite jewelry, although alexandrite in nature is a chrysoberyl.|$|E
