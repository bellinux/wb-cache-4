50|$|Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) is an {{automobile}} {{variable valve timing}} technology developed by Ford. It allows for more optimum engine performance, reduced emissions, and increased fuel efficiency compared to engines with fixed camshafts. It uses electronically controlled hydraulic valves that direct high pressure engine oil into the camshaft phaser cavity. These oil control solenoids are bolted into the cylinder heads towards {{the front of the}} engine near the camshaft phasers. The powertrain control module (PCM) transmits a signal to the solenoids to move a <b>valve</b> <b>spool</b> that regulates the flow of oil to the phaser cavity. The phaser cavity changes the valve timing by rotating the camshaft slightly from its initial orientation, which results in the camshaft timing being advanced or retarded. The PCM adjusts the camshaft timing depending on factors such as engine load and RPM.|$|E

40|$|A bond graph {{model has}} been {{developed}} in this paper concerning a high pressure industrial hydraulic system. The accuracy of the bond graph model was verified by comparing its response to the response of an actual hydraulic system and the correlation of these results is high concerning the shape, magnitude and response times. Three different tests were conducted, depending on the motion profile of the <b>valve</b> <b>spool,</b> from which an important conclusion drawn is that a long duration in the <b>valve</b> <b>spool</b> return motion has the most noticeable effect on the maximum vertical travel of the load as it significantly reduces the load oscillation amplitude after the load has reached its topmost position. What follows is an increase of the residual pressure in the hydraulic cylinder top chamber with a lesser effect on the load maximum velocity. The results of this work are used for proactive fault finding in cases of <b>valve</b> <b>spool</b> malfunctions, particularly anomalies during the <b>valve</b> <b>spool</b> motion {{and can be used}} to optimize the <b>valve</b> <b>spool</b> motion profile. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The {{flow rate}} {{of a novel}} self-spinning high speed {{hydraulic}} on/off valve is regulated by changing the relative axial position (the duty cycle) of the <b>valve</b> <b>spool</b> to the nozzles located on the valve body through driving a gerotor pump using brushless direct current motor.

Before now, the poppet valve was mainly used for emergency release <b>valves</b> while the <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> was more widely used. The poppet valve has several advantages over the <b>spool</b> <b>valve.</b> The poppet valve forms a tighter seal with the housing to prevent leakage of the hydrolic fluid flowing through the system. The poppet valve is smaller and weighs less than the <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> and {{will be able to}} give a faster response time.

40|$|A <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> as a flow {{direction}} control valve has usually been used in a hydraulic system. In recent years, some hydraulic actuator systems need high accuracy control of the <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> {{in order to control}} the delivery precisely. For the reason, it is very important practically to know dynamic motion of the spool. To analyze the dynamic characteristics of the <b>spool</b> <b>valve,</b> it is necessary to consider the dynamic motion of the spool. Springs, solenoids and working fluid, which is pressurized by the pump in the circuit, support the spool. The motion of the spool is governed complicatedly by pressure force, flow force, electromagnetic force and mechanical spring force acting on itself. As a result, it is difficult to analyze the dynamic motion of the spool, and therefore, any commercial code to calculate the dynamic characteristics of the <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> dose not exist at present.

40|$|The binlifts of refuse {{collectors}} have {{a problem}} with binlift oscillations when the binlift is lowered slowly. The problem escalates with hot oil that has lower viscosity. Most problematic the oscillations are with an accessory scale on the binlift as it does not tolerate oscillations in the position where it takes measurements. These oscillations are caused by load control valves and wrong directional control <b>valve</b> <b>spools</b> make these oscillations worse. To figure out possible solutions for the oscillations the thesis has comprehensive load control valve theory part which summarizes all the traditional and latest inventions related to load control valves. This information is used in selecting valves for measurements. In this thesis there are measurements with different load control valves, directional control <b>valve</b> <b>spools,</b> restrictors, hoses and sequence valves. Measurements are done with a rear loader and they include flow and pressure measuring. These measurements are done to figure out which combination is the best compromise between energy consumption, oscillations and cost. This compromise should also fill all standardization requirements. Several solutions are found that are not ideal, one solution which is recommended and a couple of which are recommended in case oscillations are still needed to be degreased.

40|$|A {{high-speed}} jet flowing {{inside of}} a partially-open hydraulic valve {{is accompanied by a}} reaction force, also referred to as flow force. The nature of this force has remained a mystery despite an extensive research effort spanning many decades. The momentum theory on the flow force by Lee and Blackburn (1952) explains the origin of the flow force and offers a design solution to shape the <b>valve</b> <b>spool</b> as a turbine bucket. It provides a model to calculate the compensated flow force as well. This paper shows that the model applies to a different flow case due to incorrect assumptions made. A corrected equation is presented based on a detailed analysis of the static-pressure distribution in the valve cavity as well as on a literature review of pressure loss in diffusers and nozzles. The new equation is based on the compensation taking place upstream of the valve orifice, not downstream as assumed by the momentum theory.
