30|$|Park et al. [62] {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} gluten on the white salt noodle making with flour from hard and soft wheat. The results showed that gluten incorporation (6 %) reduced water absorption of noodle dough by 3 %, shortened {{the length of the}} dough sheet by 15 and 18 %, and increased the thickness of the dough sheet by 18 and 20 % in soft and hard wheat flour, respectively. Noodles imbibed less water and imbibed water more slowly during cooking with gluten incorporation, which resulted in a 3 -min increase in cooking time for both soft and hard wheat noodles. Despite the extended cooking time of 3  min, noodles incorporated with 6 % gluten exhibited decreases in cooking loss by 15 % in soft wheat. In hard wheat flour, cooking loss of noodles was lowest with 2 % incorporation of gluten. For multi-grain noodles, buckwheat noodle making with 70 % wheat flour and 30 % buckwheat flour and addition of 5 % <b>vital</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> led to the best viscoelasticity and sensory characteristics of cooked noodle [63]. The research conducted by Wang et al. [64] indicated that, when using the combination of <b>vital</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and transglutaminase (TG) at appropriate formula, oat noodle quality was significantly improved.

It is clearly reflected by the above results that the optimum amount of <b>vital</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> in the formulations of noodles and CSB was depended on the protein quantity and quality in flour, more <b>vital</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> was required for the flour protein with low content and poor quality.|$|E

The first experiment involved 72 weanling pigs with an avg age of 20 d and avg wt of 9. 2 lb. Six diets were fed to the pigs in individual metabolism cages. Protein sources were casein, flash-dried <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> spray-dried <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> two solubilized <b>wheat</b> <b>glutens,</b> and soybean meal. Response criteria were N digestibility, biological value, and N retention. Casein had greater N digestibility, biological value, and N retention than the other protein sources. The <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> products had greater N digestibility than soybean meal. Modification of the <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> to increase its solubility, resulted in marked decreases in biological value and N retention. Experiment 2 was a nursery growth assay. A total of 180 pigs were used, with an avg age of 25 d and avg wt of 12. 3 lb. The five pelleted diets fed from d 0 to 14 were: 1) a high nutrient density diet (HNDD) with 20 % dried whey and 20 % dried skim milk (DSM); 2) HNDD with the DSM replaced by flash-dried <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and lactose; 3) HNDD with the DSM replaced by spray-dried <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and lactose; 4) HNDD with the DSM replaced by solubilized-modified <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and lactose; 5) HNDD with DSM replaced by soy protein isolate and lactose.

40|$|Wheat gluten can be hydrolyzed {{by either}} using (<b>vital)</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> or {{directly}} from wheat flour. This study investigates {{the influence of}} the presence of starch, the main component of wheat, on enzymatic wheat gluten hydrolysis. Wheat gluten present in wheat flour (WFG) and <b>vital</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> (VWG) were hydrolyzed at constant protein concentrations, but subsequently 5. 6 times higher amounts of wheat flour. Nevertheless, WFG hydrolysis at 40 % total solids resulted in significantly higher degrees of hydrolysis (DH%) than VWG hydrolysis at 7. 2 % solids. This difference increased to up to 4. 5 % in 6 h and diminished again for longer reaction times. Possible differences in the gluten composition and the presence of albumins and globulins in wheat flour could not explain the difference in DH% because the addition of starch to VWG increased the rate of hydrolysis similarly. Instead, it was concluded that starch granules impede gluten aggregation, which facilitates the hydrolysis. At higher solid concentrations of up to 70 % wheat flour, the positive effect of starch disappeared, because WFG hydrolysis was hindered by mass transfer limitations and lower water activities...|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. Sorghum (Sorghum {{bicolour}} (L) Moench) and millets are drought resistant cereals (Kent and Evers, 1994) {{that can}} grow {{in areas with}} poor soils and inconsistent rainfall (Dendy, 1995) where other crops fail. They serve as staple food for many people in tropical sub- Saharan Africa and Asia (Klopfenstein and Hoseney, 1995). Traditionally, bread is made from wheat, which is a temperate cereal not able to grow well in these tropical regions. Leavened bread is seldom made from anything other than wheat (Alais and Linden, 1991) and {{this is because of}} the unique visco-elastic property of wheat flour (Hoseney, 1994). Unfortunately in tropical regions such as South Africa wheat is imported at a premium price. The aim {{of this study was to}} produce a wheat-finger millet composite flour which is suitable for bread making. Finger millet grain (FMV 6) was milled with a laboratory hammer mill fitted with a 0. 8 mm screen. The following wheat-finger millet composite doughs were made using standard bread making methods, 0 : 100 (Control); 90 : 10; 80 : 20; 70 : 30, respectively. Selected quality attributes of the composite dough and the bread thereof were analysed using standard methods. The formulation with 10 % finger millet showed better results than other formulations. One formulation (80 : 20) was selected for improvement which included mixing ingredients at elevated temperatures (50 °C and 93 °C) and addition of 0. 002 % of a lipase enzyme, lipopan F; 0. 3 % <b>vital</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and a combination of 0. 002 % lipopan F and 0. 3 % gluten. All formulations (including the basic formulation) contained Fungamyl Super MA (enzyme combination which contained fungal a-amylase and a xylanase). As the mixing temperatures were elevated, loaf volume decreased but when the industrial baking enzymes were introduced there was an improvement in peak time, dough stability and loaf volume. Image analysis showed that there was an improvement in crumb structure and bubble size distribution after the application of enzyme lipopan F. The crumb colour was lighter and softer when a combination of enzyme lipopan F and <b>vital</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> was applied. The bread made from formulation 80 : 20 with addition of a combination of enzyme lipopan F and <b>vital</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> (WFM 2 GL) was more acceptable than other formulations except the control bread. The bread had a high score in taste, crust appearance and mouth feel. The results suggest that there is a potential for producing a composite bread by substituting wheat flour with finger millet flour (up to 20 %); mixing at 25 °C with application of a combination of a lipase and <b>vital</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> However, more work is needed to improve the quality of the bread to a greater extent...|$|E

The main objective of this thesis was to explore plant proteins, more specifically <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> as a binder in wood adhesives intended for typical solid wood applications such as furniture and flooring. Alkaline and acidic dispersions of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> were used as wood adhesives to bond together beech wood substrates. Soy protein isolate {{was used as a}} reference. The tensile shear strengths of the substrates were measured for comparison of bond strength and resistance to cold water. AFM in colloidal probe mode was used to investigate nanoscale adhesion between cellulose and protein films. <b>Wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> was divided into the two protein classes; glutenins and gliadins, and their adhesive performance was compared with that of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> Heat treatment and mild hydrolysis were investigated as means for improving bonding performance of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> The treated <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> samples were analysed by SE-HPLC and 13 C-NMR to correlate molecular size distribution and structural changes with bonding performance. Soy protein isolate is superior to <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> especially in regards to water resistance. However, the bond strength of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> is improved when starved bond lines are avoided. The AFM analysis reveals higher interfacial adhesion between soy protein isolate and cellulose than between <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and cellulose. These results partly explain some of the differences in bonding performance between the plant proteins. Soy protein isolate contains more polar amino acid residues than <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and possibly interacts more strongly with cellulose. Furthermore, the bond performances of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and glutenin are similar, while that of gliadin is inferior to the others, especially regarding water resistance. The extent of penetration of the dispersions into the wood material has a large impact on the results. The bonding performance of gliadin is similar to the others when over-penetration of the dispersion into the wood material is avoided. Moreover, the bond strength of the <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> samples heated at 90 °C was in general improved compared to that of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> A small improvement was also obtained for some of the hydrolyzed <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> samples (degree of hydrolysis: 0 - 0. 6 %). The improvements in bonding performance for the heat treated samples are due to polymerization, while the improvements for the hydrolyzed samples are due to denaturation.

Second, the study evaluates wheat-gluten-based packaging film and compares it with low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polylactide (PLA) packaging film over the life cycle of these products. Scenarios including extrusion and casting for film production, incineration with energy recovery, and composting for end-of-life treatments are evaluated. Such comparison offers insight in environmental benefits of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> over conventional plastic film as well as its bio-based alternative and identifies its optimal production and disposal methods. For <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> production, the LCA results show that the impacts of the <b>wheat</b> cultivation and <b>gluten</b> drying phase are dominant in the majority of the 18 impact categories in the ReCiPe midpoint assessment method. The LCA results also exhibit that the scenario with <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> film produced by extrusion and incinerated to recover embodied energy is favorable from environmental perspective.

40|$|<b>Wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> is a {{naturally}} occurring protein polymer. It {{is produced in}} abundance by the agricultural industry, is biodegradable and very inexpensive (less than $ 0. 50 /lb). It has unique viscoelastic properties, {{which makes it a}} promising alternative to synthetic plastics. The unplasticized <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> is, however, brittle. Plasticizers such as glycerol are commonly used to give flexibility to the articles made of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> but with the penalty of greatly reduced stiffness. Former work showed that the brittleness of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> can also be improved by modifying it with a tri-thiol additive with no penalty of reduced stiffness. However, the cost of the customer designed tri-thiol additive was very high and it was unlikely to make a cost effective material from such an expensive additive. ^ Here we designed a new, inexpensive thiol additive called SHPVA. It was synthesized from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) through a simple esterification reaction. The mechanical data of the molded wheat gluten/SHPVA material indicated that <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> was toughened by SHPVA. As a control, the wheat gluten/PVA material showed no improvement compared with <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> itself. Several techniques have been used to characterize this novel protein/polymer blend. Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) study showed two phases in both wheat gluten/PVA and wheat gluten/SHPVA material. However, scanning electron microscope (SEM) pictures indicated that PVA was macroscopically separated from <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> while <b>wheat</b> gluten/SHPVA had a homogeneous look. The phase image from the atomic force microscope (AFM) gave interesting contrast based on the difference in the mechanical properties of these two phases. ^ The biodegradation behavior of these protein/polymer blends was examined in soil. SHPVA was not degraded in the time period of the experiment. Wheat gluten/SHPVA degraded slower than <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> We also developed some other interesting material systems based on <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> including the <b>wheat</b> gluten/basalt composite and wheat gluten/clay composite materials. Their mechanical properties and biodegradation behaviors were determined. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{combined}} time domain NMR and rheology approach {{to quantify the}} water distribution in a phase separated protein blend. The approach forms {{the basis for a}} new tool to assess the microstructural properties of phase separated biopolymer blends, making it highly relevant for many food and non-food related applications. First, we determine the relaxation rate of absorbed water, and the viscoelastic properties of the separated phases as function of the water content. Next, the same properties are measured for the protein blends. Finally, predictions for water distribution obtained from rheological experiments are made via the polymer blending law, and compared to a more direct assessment of the water distribution with time-domain NMR relaxometry (TD-NMR). In this study, the protein blend consists of soy protein isolate (SPI) and <b>vital</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> (WG). We demonstrate that predictions for water distribution are similar for both TD-NMR and rheological measurements. It turns out that water does not distribute homogenously over the phases. Independent of the SPI and WG ratio, more water is absorbed by the SPI phase relative to the WG phase, which largely determines the resulting rheological properties of the blends. </p...|$|E
40|$|Two <b>vital</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> {{samples were}} {{submitted}} to an Osborne type fractionation. The proteolytic {{activities of the}} resulting fractions were evaluated. Gluten contained endoproteolytic, exoproteolytic, carboxypeptidase, aminopeptidase and N alpha-benzoylarginine-p-nitroanilide hydrolase activities. After extraction with 0. 5 M NaCl, and subsequently with 70 % (v/v) ethanol, little activity remained in the extracted gluten. Upon autodigestion of gluten no (microbial) enzymes were released. High specificities of gluten-associated proteolytic enzymes were noted and their effects were clearly visible on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sum of lysine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and arginine accounted for ca. 40 - 44 % of the released amino acids, while they only make up ca. 18 % of vital gluten proteins. Good correlations {{were found between the}} proportions of the amino acids released by the different Osborne fractions as a result of autodigestion, indicating that the gluten hydrolysing enzymes found in the different Osborne fractions are probably the same. Autodigestion of gluten proteins was reduced by ca. 73 - 76 % upon addition of pepstatin A (0. 2 mM), an inhibitor of aspartic proteases, and by c. 39 - 41 % by phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride (1. 0 mM), a serine protease inhibitor.

40|$|The {{antioxidants}} BHA, BHT, and {{ascorbic acid}} {{were added to}} flaxmeal breads to prevent rancidity. Six types of yeast leavened breads were evaluated: control (100 % bread flour), flaxmeal (15 %) bread, and flaxmeal (15 %) bread that contained 0. 01 % respectively of BHA, BHT, BHA and BHT, and ascorbic acid. <b>Vital</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> was added in all the flaxmeal breads. Chemical, objective and sensory tests were {{used to evaluate the}} breads. The crumb texture of all the experimental breads was significantly softer (p≤ 0. 05) than the control breads, but the control breads were significantly moister (p≤ 0. 05) than the flaxmeal breads that contained BHA and BHT, separately. No significant differences (p> 0. 05) were found in loaf volume of the control bread and the experimental breads. The crumb color of the experimental breads was significantly darker (p 0. 05) were found in peroxide values between the control breads and experimental breads after eight weeks. The QDA sensory tests showed that breads containing BHA or in combination with BHT were moister, chewier and had the least noticeable stale taste when compared to the control breads. Ascorbic acid was not as effective as BHA or a combination of BHA and BHT in preventing lipid oxidation...|$|E
50|$|On 5 April 2007, {{several days}} after the United States halted all <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> imports, the Chinese {{government}} categorically denied any connection to the North American food poisonings to The New York Times, claiming they had no record of exporting any agricultural products that could have tainted the recalled pet foods, including the <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> {{that has been the}} focus of the investigation. The general manager of the Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Company also denied that they had exported any <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> to North America.|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryJ. S. DrouillardA {{series of}} {{experiments}} were conducted in which <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> film forming solutions were modified by various means to produce films that would improve resistance to ruminal degradation. There was an interaction between pH and temperature, whereby low pH (pH 3) and high temperature (75 °C) of film forming solution resulted in films that had highest resistance to microbial degradation. Strategies that proved unsuccessful in improving resistance to ruminal degradation included use of the cross-linking enzyme, transglutaminase; induction of a Maillard reaction; and increasing the time of heating film forming solutions. Utilizing HCl versus acetic acid as the means to lower the pH of the film forming solution resulted in poor film formation, which {{can be attributed to}} glutenin‟s solubility in acetic acid. When acetic acid was replaced with 25 % HCl, however, no compromise in film formation was observed and ruminal degradability was not affected. In order to develop an economical and effective means of encapsulating lysine for rumen bypass, <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and corn zein were evaluated as encapsulation materials. Coating soybean meal with either <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> or zein resulted in superior protection against ruminal degradation when compared to unprotected soybean meal. Compared to <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> zein was observed to have greater resistance to ruminal degradation in vitro. Lysine was encapsulated by the spray dry method with <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> or zein. Results from an in vitro ammonia release experiment were inconclusive with respect to effectiveness of the encapsulation process. <b>Wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> films were approximately 59 % degraded in pepsin solution. Our results suggest that 72 % of the <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> film will bypass the rumen and 59 % of the bypass fraction of the film will be degraded in the abomasum. <b>Wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and zein are suitable candidates for development of encapsulated nutrients for ruminal protection...|$|R
