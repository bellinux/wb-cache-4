50|$|In 1923, at age 21, Sunnen {{applied for}} his first of nearly 100 patents, a <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> tool, marking the {{beginnings}} of Sunnen Company. However that same year he was nearly killed in a work explosion which burnt most of his body, and spent a year recovering. He returned to his brother's garage for employment and while in Mexico, Missouri, met and married Miss Cornelia Miller.https://web.archive.org/web/20110718203122/http://www.ja.org/nested/stlouis/Sunnen.pdf They moved to St. Louis to pursue Sunnen's manufacturing ambitions in 1924. There Sunnen converted a 1916 Hupmobile into a camper and {{set out on the}} road to sell 500 of his new <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> tools. They sold two or three tools a day until they reached Mankato, Minnesota where a large distributor of shop tools bought his remaining stock and placed an order for 1,000 additional tools. Following the trip Sunnen returned home to build his manufacturing business around the auto engine rebuilding trade.https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025751/http://www.manufacturingcenter.com/metlfax/archives/0701/0701lct.asp The Sunnen Company grew to become a renowned global manufacturer of precision honing devices, and holds a position of global prominence to this day.|$|E
50|$|Valve {{clearance}} {{refers to}} the small gap between a <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> and a valve stem that ensures that the valve completely closes. On engines with mechanical valve adjustment, excessive clearance causes noise from the valve train. A too small valve clearance can result in the valves not closing properly, {{this results in a}} loss of performance and possibly overheating of exhaust valves. Typically, the clearance must be readjusted each 20000 mi with a feeler gauge.|$|E

50|$|From 1954 to 1963, the {{high-pressure}} 235 engine with mechanical <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> {{was used}} in some trucks. From 1956 to 1962, all 235 engines used in cars had hydraulic lifters.|$|R
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} <b>valve</b> <b>lifter,</b> {{also known}} as a hydraulic tappet or a hydraulic lash adjuster, is a device for maintaining zero valve clearance in an internal combustion engine. Conventional solid valve lifters require regular adjusting to maintain a small clearance between the valve and its rocker or cam follower. This space prevents the parts from binding as they expand with the engine's heat, but can also lead to noisy operation and increased wear as the parts rattle against one another until they reach operating temperature. The hydraulic lifter was designed to compensate for this small tolerance, allowing the valve train to operate with zero clearance—leading to quieter operation, longer engine life, and eliminating the need for periodic adjustment of valve clearance.|$|E
5000|$|On September 5, 2008, Honda {{introduced}} a revised CBR600RR for the 2009 model year. Combined ABS became available as an option. Other changes included updates {{to the engine}} such as changes to its pistons, cylinder head and exhaust that Honda claims will increase torque delivery between 8,000-12,000 rpm with a 3.5% increase in torque at 10,000 rpm. The CBR600RR’s engine also received a new high resistance <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> and a popup valve system inherited from the CBR1000RR. looks {{were the same as}} last year apart from some extra mouldings added to the fairing mid sections that enhance stability and reduce noise emission levels by now totally enclosing the clutch and gearbox [...] Although all of these changes involved the addition of some materials, the overall weight of the 2009 CBR600RR remained the same as the 2008 model. This was achieved through weight savings in the engine, exhaust, and the chassis.|$|E
50|$|During the Isle of Man TT {{practice}} in 1928 two fast laps were attempted {{and it was}} rumoured that under certain conditions the lower front ends of the swinging-fork assembly grounded and possibly the centre stand as well. Due to this problem it was not used in the actual race. In fact {{an article published in}} the 21 June issue of the Motor Cycle attributed the failure to complete the two high speed laps to a loose exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> affecting the valve operation. The motorcycle was not used in the actual race and was returned to the Birmingham factory. Despite assurances that the journalist apparently received that the model would go straight into production after the TT, this never happened. This could have been due to there being no provision for adjusting the suspension resulting in difficulty in setting the motorcycle up for riders of differing weights nor would it be possible to accommodate pillion loads.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic tappets {{require more}} complex and more {{expensive}} cylinder head design. A number of subcompact car manufacturers prefer solid <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> due to lower design and production cost rather than hydraulic tappets.|$|R
5000|$|Compared {{with the}} M40, the M42 {{features}} a DOHC valvetrain, a timing chain, hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> {{and an increased}} 10:1 compression ratio. Later versions of the M42 also feature a dual length intake manifold (called [...] "DISA").|$|R
50|$|The initial {{engine was}} the Ford 170 CID L straight-6, {{modified}} with solid <b>valve</b> <b>lifters,</b> a 6 USqt L oil pan, heavy-duty fuel pump, oil-bath air cleaner, and a carburetor with a float bowl compensated against tilting.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} IOE layouts used atmospheric {{inlet valves}} which were held {{closed with a}} weak spring and were opened by the pressure differential created when the piston went down on the inlet stroke. This worked well with low-speed early engines and {{had the benefit of}} being very simple and cheap, but the weak spring was unable to close the valve fast enough as the RPM's of engines increased, necessitating stronger springs, which in turn needed direct mechanical action to open, as the atmospheric pressure of 15psi limits the total force available from creating a pressure differential, meaning that a 15-lb spring is the strongest that can be used (for practical purposes, {{it would have to be}} lighter still). When the limits of this system were reached, the design was improved without substantial changes to the head casting by adding a mechanical system to open the inlet valves and stronger springs to close them. In both cases, the exhaust valves were in the block and were opened by contact with a camshaft through a tappet or <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> and closed by springs.|$|E
5000|$|In a F-head/IOE engine, {{the intake}} {{manifold}} and its valves are located atop the cylinders, in the cylinder head, and are operated by rocker arms which reverse {{the motion of}} the pushrods so that the intake valves open downward into the combustion chamber. The exhaust manifold and its valves are located beside or as part of the cylinders, in the block. The exhaust valves are either roughly or exactly parallel with the pistons; their faces point upwards and they are not operated by separate pushrods, but by contact with a camshaft through the tappet or <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> and an integrated valve stem/pushrod. The valves were offset to one side, forming {{what seemed to be a}} pocket, leading to the term [...] "pocket valve" [...] being used for IOE engines. An F-head engine combines features from both overhead-valve and flathead type engines, the inlet valve operating via pushrod and rocker arm and opening downward like an overhead valve engine, while the exhaust valve is offset from the cylinder and opens upward via an integrated pushrod/valve stem directly actuated by the camshaft, much like the valves in a flathead engine.|$|E

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{research}} in the area of mass transfer of air as a bubble in hydraulic fluid or lubricant is very limited. There are only a few studies on the interaction of oils with air, especially knowledge of air solubility of the oil and diffusivity of dissolved air in oil, namely aeration. This paper will study the effect of aeration on a direct acting hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> system in an internal combustion engine. Aeration is, primarily, influenced by hydrodynamic factors such as, design features of the oil system and the physicochemical characteristics of the oil. The direct acting hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> (DAHVL) was introduced to the automotive industry because of some definite advantages, such as acoustic improvement and friction reduction. Although, the aforementioned, advantages of DAHVL are significant, the aeration effect due to hydraulics creates a challenge. Aeration stems from compressibility of air in oil. It is a fact that the incompressibility of the oil hydraulically maintains all components of the valve train in contact. Therefore, aeration tends to create separation between the valve train components. This separation creates certain effects on the dynamic performance. This paper has concentrated on 3 major specifics: how oil aeration affects engine operation (via a linear math model compared to experimental data), a brief discussion on what variables inherent in the design could significantly improve the system 2 ̆ 7 s robustness to aeration effects (experimental only) and on what causes aeration (theory) ...|$|E

First, we analyze the effect of combination of machining accuracy distributions {{and the effect of}} buffer capacity on the production rate. Next, we analyze the effect of machining lot size and setup time required in dimension control on the production rate, and present the existence of the optimal lot size which yields the maximum production rate.

40|$|Camshaft can {{be defined}} as a machine element having the curve {{outlined}} or a curved grooved, gives the predetermined specified motion to another element called the follower. In automotive field, Camshaft and its follower take importance roles to run the engine. Nowadays the car maker have developed the vary schemes of cam profile to match with the engine performance. Since the system deals with high load and high speed and many analyses have been carried out on the failure of the components. The analysis is done either by experimental or finite element analysis. The result from the finite element analysis is an approximate of the component failure. In the mean time, the software development is improving in this few decades. Problems with the components such as cam and rocker arm are wears while the valve bends. This project aim determines the stress concentration on the cam and followers during normal operation. More over, this project used the cam, rocker arms, <b>valve</b> <b>lifter,</b> exhaust valve and accessories used in 4 G 13 engine in type. Solidworks, Cosmosmotion and Algor software are used for determination of stress concentration on the components. The finite element analysis are done for determination of stress concentration during 30 degree of cam where the roller fully climbing the cam and during maximum exhaust valve lift. Cam is rotated at 2000 rpm, 3000 rpm and 6000 rpm of crank rotation. In the analysis, the typical values for coefficient of friction, materials, and spring rate are used. The result from finite element analysis showed that the maximum stress concentration occurred at rocker arm that leads to the failure of the component. Value for maximum stress is over the allowable stress for rocker arm material. Other components are approximately safe where the maximum stress is not over the allowable stress for components...|$|E
