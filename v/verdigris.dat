5|$|Michelangelo used {{a limited}} palette of {{pigments}} comprising lead white, azurite, <b>verdigris</b> and few others. He avoided ochres and used very little vermilion.|$|E
5|$|The {{pigments}} {{available to}} painters were more varied; monks in monasteries used <b>verdigris,</b> made by soaking copper in fermenting wine, to color medieval manuscripts. They also used finely-ground malachite, which made a luminous green. They used green earth colors for backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|Volume V {{covers the}} grapevine, wine made from it, grapes and raisins; but also strong {{medicinal}} potions made by boiling many other plants including mandrake, hellebore, and various metal compounds, {{such as what}} may be zinc oxide, <b>verdigris</b> and iron oxide.|$|E
5|$|At {{the head}} of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, the Tulsa Port of Catoosa is an inland port in the United States and connects barge traffic from Tulsa to the Mississippi River via the <b>Verdigris</b> and Arkansas rivers. The {{facility}} {{is one of the largest}} riverports in the United States and contributes to one of the busiest waterways in the world via its course to the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{does not}} react with water, {{but it does}} slowly react with {{atmospheric}} oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of <b>verdigris</b> (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{comprises}} four individual {{pieces of}} oak, painted over a chalk ground bound with glue. The preparation wood is dated to around 1410, giving an estimated {{date for the}} Van der Weyden in the mid-1430s. The dominant pigments are lead white (often used in the panel to highlight blue and green passages), charcoal black, ultramarine, lead-tin-yellow, <b>verdigris</b> and red lake. There has been some discolouration– some greens are now brown, including pigments used to depict grass in the background.|$|E
5|$|Two {{inland ports}} on rivers serve Oklahoma: the Port of Muskogee and the Tulsa Port of Catoosa. The state's only port {{handling}} international cargo, the Tulsa Port of Catoosa {{is the most}} inland ocean-going port {{in the nation and}} ships over two million tons of cargo each year. Both ports are on the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, which connects barge traffic from Tulsa and Muskogee to the Mississippi River via the <b>Verdigris</b> and Arkansas rivers, contributing to one of the busiest waterways in the world.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus, {{the origin}} of the name of the metal, from aes сyprium (metal of Cyprus), later {{corrupted}} to сuprum, from which the words copper (English), cuivre (French), Koper (Dutch) and Kupfer (German) are all derived. The commonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite, malachite, and turquoise, and have been used widely and historically as pigments. Copper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green <b>verdigris</b> (or patina). Copper is sometimes used in decorative art, both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents, fungicides, and wood preservatives.|$|E
5|$|The Romans had {{a greater}} {{appreciation}} for the color green; it {{was the color of}} Venus, the goddess of gardens, vegetables and vineyards. The Romans made a fine green earth pigment that was widely used in the wall paintings of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Lyon, Vaison-la-Romaine, and other Roman cities. They also used the pigment <b>verdigris,</b> made by soaking copper plates in fermenting wine. By the second century AD, the Romans were using green in paintings, mosaics and glass, and there were ten different words in Latin for varieties of green.|$|E
5|$|The {{greens are}} mostly <b>verdigris,</b> {{although}} those predominant {{in the landscape}} are mostly blends of blue and yellow pigments, and the green of the cloth worn by Mary Salome is malachite mixed with yellow lake. The browns are blends of reds and blacks. John's red robe is composed from cinnabar and vermilion made from rubia and insect dyes. Some of the reds are mixed with earth colours not susceptible {{to the effects of}} light, and have thus survived close to their original appearance. The black pigments are generally bone blacks but in places from charcoal. The blacks are mixed with chalk in areas, producing a red to brownish 'earthy' appearance.|$|E
5|$|Vinegar {{was known}} early in civilization {{as the natural}} result of {{exposure}} of beer and wine to air, because acetic acid-producing bacteria are present globally. The use of acetic acid in alchemy extends into the 3rd century BC, when the Greek philosopher Theophrastus described how vinegar acted on metals to produce pigments useful in art, including white lead (lead carbonate) and <b>verdigris,</b> a green mixture of copper salts including copper(II) acetate. Ancient Romans boiled soured wine to produce a highly sweet syrup called sapa. Sapa that was produced in lead pots was rich in lead acetate, a sweet substance also called sugar of lead or sugar of Saturn, which contributed to lead poisoning among the Roman aristocracy.|$|E
25|$|It {{includes}} the Deep Fork National Wildlife Refuge, Ozark Plateau National Wildlife Refuge, Arkansas River, Canadian River, Grand River, Illinois River, and <b>Verdigris</b> River.|$|E
25|$|Copper’s {{most famous}} trait is its display from a bright {{metallic}} colour to iridescent brown to near black {{and finally to}} a greenish <b>verdigris</b> patina. Architects describe the array of browns as russet, chocolate, plum, mahogany, and ebony. The metal’s distinctive green patina has long been coveted by architects and designers.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of the Lake Oologah Dam, Highway 88 proceeded on a more southerly course north of Claremore, crossing the <b>Verdigris</b> River downstream of the current dam location and ending at US-169 south of Oologah. The 1965 map is the first to show the route crossing Oologah Dam. The route has had no further major changes since then.|$|E
25|$|The McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System {{begins at}} the Tulsa Port of Catoosa on the <b>Verdigris</b> River, enters the Arkansas River near Muskogee, and runs via an {{extensive}} lock and dam system to the Mississippi River. Through Oklahoma and Arkansas, dams which artificially deepen and widen the river to sustain commercial barge traffic and recreational use give the river {{the appearance of a}} series of reservoirs.|$|E
25|$|Of the bedchambers, {{only the}} four corner rooms have {{fireplaces}}. Their fireplaces and surrounds {{did have some}} architectural detail. The corner rooms had two or three windows each, while the inner chambers only had one window each. The walls of the corner bedchambers were painted with more expensive shades, such as Prussian blue or <b>verdigris.</b> The attic was accessible {{through one of the}} inner bedrooms.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the first}} {{synthetic}} pigments were white lead (basic lead carbonate, (PbCO3)2Pb(OH)2) and blue frit (Egyptian Blue). White lead is made by combining lead with vinegar (acetic acid, CH3COOH) {{in the presence of}} CO2. Blue frit is calcium copper silicate and was made from glass colored with a copper ore, such as malachite. These pigments were used as early as the second millennium BCE Later premodern additions to the range of synthetic pigments included vermillion, <b>verdigris</b> and lead-tin-yellow.|$|E
25|$|Raphael painted {{several of}} his works on wood support (Madonna of the Pinks) but he also used canvas (Sistine Madonna) and {{he was known to}} employ drying oils such as linseed or walnut oils. His palette was rich and he used almost all of the then {{available}} pigments such as ultramarine, lead-tin-yellow, carmine, vermilion, madder lake, <b>verdigris</b> and ochres. In {{several of his}} paintings (Ansidei Madonna) he even employed the rare brazilwood lake, metallic powdered gold and even less known metallic powdered bismuth.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Ascalon founded an Israeli {{decorative}} arts manufacturing company, , which produced trademark bronze and brass menorahs and other Judaic and secular decorative art and functional {{items that were}} exported in large numbers worldwide. Maurice Ascalon's well-recognized designs, some art deco, others more traditional, introduced {{the use of a}} deliberate, chemically induced green patina (<b>verdigris)</b> to Israeli metalwork, which is now a hallmark of Israel's crafts industry. During Israel's War for Independence in 1948, Maurice designed munitions for the Israeli Army and, {{at the request of the}} Israeli government, retrofitted his factory to produce munitions for the war effort. In 1956 Maurice immigrated to the United States.|$|E
25|$|ATSDR {{represents}} the Department of Health and Human Services on the National Response Team {{and works with}} other agencies to provide technical assistance during emergencies involving hazardous substances, such as chemical spills. In July 2007, for example, ATSDR responded to the <b>Verdigris</b> River flood in Coffeyville, Kansas, after an oil refinery spilled crude oil into the floodwaters, contaminating many homes in the city. ATSDR worked with EPA {{and state and local}} authorities to provide health information to local residents and advised those agencies during the clean-up process. ATSDR also assists with responding to terrorism incidents, which have included the September 11 attacks and the 2001 anthrax attacks. ATSDR responded to 132 chemical emergency events in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Last of the Gaderene by Mark Gatiss and Deadly Reunion by Terrance Dicks and Barry Letts {{are both}} close homages to the Delgado/Pertwee stories. In Last of the Gaderene, the Master, {{disguised}} as Police Inspector LeMaitre, assists an alien race called the Gaderene to invade Earth, {{starting with a}} small village. In Deadly Reunion, he attempts to control powerful forces through a cult, but finds himself {{at the mercy of}} a godlike alien. The Delgado Master also appears in <b>Verdigris</b> by Paul Magrs, a more parodic take on the Pertwee era. The eponymous genie spends much of the novel impersonating the Master, who is in fact controlling him: the real Master appears in the novel's epilogue, buying a Chinese takeaway.|$|E
25|$|I-44/SH-66 cut diagonally {{through the}} city of Tulsa. In West Tulsa, Interstate 244 {{branches}} off to serve the downtown area. I-44/SH-66 follow the Skelly Drive through midtown. The highways interchange with the Okmulgee Beeline, the US-75 freeway before crossing the Arkansas River. The next freeway interchange is with the Broken Arrow Expressway, carrying US-64 and SH-51, followed by the Mingo Valley Expressway, carrying US-169 I-244 then merges with I-44 at its eastern terminus. I-44/SH-66 cross into Rogers County and the suburb of Catoosa, serving as the southern terminus of SH-167. SH-66 then splits off from I-44, initially following an old alignment of the Interstate where it transitioned into the Will Rogers Turnpike. SH-66 then downgrades to an expressway as it passes through Catoosa, home of the Blue Whale. Northeast of Catoosa, near <b>Verdigris,</b> SH-66 intersects SH-266 at its eastern terminus.|$|E
25|$|In {{agreement}} {{with a call}} from three vacant churches of Oxford, Paynesville and Elizabeth, Alabama, Loughridge preached six months; soon afterward, Loughridge was appointed by the Presbyterian board for foreign missions to visit the Creek Indians, west of Arkansas, {{to find out whether}} or not {{they would be willing to}} allow a preaching and mission school on their lands. Loughridge set out on horse-back, November 2, 1841, from Eutaw, and rode about six hundred miles. On December 6 he met the chiefs of the Creek (Muskogee) Nation, and brought the matter before them. Loughridge had to wait about three weeks for the council to meet to consider his proposal; While there he took time visiting several parts of the nation; there was not a missionary in the whole nation, nor was there an institution of learning in all the land, except a little government school which pretended to be taught by a man who was afterwards proved to be a counterfeiter. When the council met they told Loughridge that they did not want preaching, because it broke up their old customs, their busks, ball-plays and dances; but they did want him to come and establish a school. He informed them that he was a preacher, and unless they allowed him to preach to the people he would not come help them. After long conference, they finally decided that if he would establish a school they would allow him to preach at the school-house, but nowhere else; after significant uncertainty Loughridge agreed to these terms; and mounting his horse he returned to Alabama to prepare for the move to Indian Territory. After some delay in getting ready, he returned by steamer, and arrived, with his young wife, in the nation, at the <b>Verdigris</b> landing, February 5, 1843.|$|E

500|$|Like {{other common}} colors, green has several {{completely}} opposite associations. While {{it is the}} color most associated by Europeans and Americans with good health, {{it is also the}} color most often associated with toxicity and poison. There was a solid foundation for this association; in the nineteenth century several popular paints and pigments, notably <b>verdigris,</b> vert de Schweinfurt and vert de Paris, were highly toxic, containing copper or arsenic. The intoxicating drink absinthe was known as [...] "the green fairy".|$|E
500|$|<b>Verdigris</b> is made {{by placing}} a plate or blade of copper, brass or bronze, {{slightly}} warmed, into a vat of fermenting wine, leaving it there for several weeks, and then scraping off and drying the green powder that forms on the metal. The process of making <b>verdigris</b> was described in ancient times by Pliny. It {{was used by the}} Romans in the murals of Pompeii, and in Celtic medieval manuscripts as early as the 5th century AD. It produced a blue-green which no other pigment could imitate, but it had drawbacks; it was unstable, it could not resist dampness, it did not mix well with other colors, it could ruin other colors with which it came into contact., and it was toxic. Leonardo da Vinci, in his treatise on painting, warned artists not to use it. It was widely used in miniature paintings in Europe and Persia in the 16th and 17th centuries. Its use largely ended in the late 19th century, when it was replaced by the safer and more stable chrome green. Viridian, also called chrome green, is a pigment made with chromium oxide dihydrate, was patented in 1859. [...] It became popular with painters, since, unlike other synthetic greens, it was stable and not toxic. Vincent van Gogh used it, along with Prussian blue, to create a dark blue sky with a greenish tint in his painting Cafe terrace at night.|$|E
500|$|Lead {{was used}} for making water pipes in the Roman Empire; the Latin word for the metal, plumbum, is {{the origin of the}} English word [...] "plumbing". Its ease of working and {{resistance}} to corrosion ensured its widespread use in other applications including pharmaceuticals, roofing, currency, and warfare. Writers of the time, such as Cato the Elder, Columella, and Pliny the Elder, recommended lead (or lead-coated) vessels for the preparation of sweeteners and preservatives added to wine and food. The lead conferred an agreeable taste due to the formation of [...] "sugar of lead" [...] (lead(II) acetate), whereas copper or bronze vessels could impart a bitter flavor through <b>verdigris</b> formation.|$|E
500|$|Next along US-60's {{route is}} Nowata County, {{and the county}} seat of the same name, [...] east of Bartlesville. In Nowata, the route uses a series of local streets to pass through town, following, from west to east, Davis Avenue, Pecan Street, Delaware Avenue, and Pine Street before turning onto Cherokee Avenue. It intersects with US-169 Alternate at Maple Street, then with US-169 itself at Ash Street. In the east part of Nowata, US-60 {{transitions}} from Cherokee Avenue to Fairview Avenue, which it remains on as it exits town. [...] east of Nowata, the highway passes through unincorporated Coodys Bluff, where it crosses the <b>Verdigris</b> River. [...] east of Coody's Bluff, the highway junctions with SH-28. US-60 continues into Craig County, leaving Nowata County.|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{the statue}} was a dull copper color, but shortly after 1900 a green patina, also called <b>verdigris,</b> {{caused by the}} {{oxidation}} of the copper skin, began to spread. As early as 1902 it was mentioned in the press; by 1906 it had entirely covered the statue. Believing that the patina was evidence of corrosion, Congress authorized [...] for various repairs, and to paint the statue both inside and out. There was considerable public protest against the proposed exterior painting. The Army Corps of Engineers studied the patina for any ill effects to the statue and concluded that it protected the skin, [...] "softened {{the outlines of the}} Statue and made it beautiful." [...] The statue was painted only on the inside. The Corps of Engineers also installed an elevator to take visitors from the base {{to the top of the}} pedestal.|$|E
500|$|Described by {{mushroom}} enthusiast Antonio Carluccio as [...] "not exactly nice to look at", the cap is {{at first}} dome or barrel-shaped, becoming convex and flattened with age with {{a diameter of}} up to [...] The cap center is often depressed. The cuticle of the cap is green, most profoundly in the center, with patches of the same color dispersed radially around the center in an [...] pattern. The color of the cuticle is often of variable shade, ranging from gray to <b>verdigris</b> to grass-green. The extent of the patching of the cuticle is also variable, giving specimens with limited patches a resemblance to other green-capped species of Russula, such as R.aeruginea. The green patches of the cap lie on a white to pale green background. The cap, while frequently round, may also exhibit irregular lobes and cracks. The cap cuticle is thin, and can be readily peeled off the surface to {{a distance of about}} halfway towards the cap center.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{entering}} Rogers County, I-44/US-412/SH-66 {{parallel the}} southern {{boundary of the}} county, staying {{just north of the}} Rogers–Tulsa and, further east, Rogers–Wagoner county lines. In Rogers County, the three highways enter the city of Catoosa, one of Tulsa's eastern suburbs. In Catoosa, the freeway serves as the southern terminus of SH-167, which serves the city's port, and SH-66 splits off toward Claremore. I-44 and US-412 continue east for a short distance before going separate directions; I-44 exits from US-412 and joins the Will Rogers Turnpike. This interchange is also the northern terminus of the Creek Turnpike. US-412 becomes an expressway, and continues east of the interchange, passing through Fair Oaks on its way out of the Tulsa metro. In rural south-central Rogers County, it connects to SH-412P, a state highway spur to Port 33, before crossing the <b>Verdigris</b> River, a component of the McClellan–Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System. US-412 continues east through unincorporated territory before reaching Inola, where it has an interchange with SH-88, [...] north of that highway's southern terminus. US-412 then heads eastward out of Rogers County.|$|E
500|$|The text is {{accompanied}} by many full-page miniatures, while smaller painted decorations appear throughout the text in unprecedented quantities. The decoration {{of the book is}} famous for combining intricate detail with bold and energetic compositions. The characteristics of the Insular manuscript initial, as described by Carl Nordenfalk, here reach their most extreme realisation: [...] "the initials ... are conceived as elastic forms expanding and contracting with a pulsating rhythm. The kinetic energy of their contours escapes into freely drawn appendices, a spiral line which in turn generates new curvilinear motifs...". The illustrations feature a broad range of colours, with purple, lilac, red, pink, green, and yellow being the colours most often used. Earlier manuscripts tend toward more narrow palettes: the Book of Durrow, for example, uses only four colours. As is usual with Insular work, there was no use of gold or silver leaf in the manuscript. The pigments for the illustrations, which included red and yellow ochre, green copper pigment (sometimes called <b>verdigris),</b> indigo, and possibly lapis lazuli, would have been imported from the Mediterranean region and, {{in the case of the}} lapis lazuli, from northeast Afghanistan. Though the presence of lapis lazuli has long been considered evidence of the great cost required to create the manuscript, recent examination of the pigments has proven that lapis lazuli was not used.|$|E
