5|$|The Royal party {{arrived at}} the Gare de l'Est train station in Paris in the pre-dawn hours of August 10, rejoined by Macfarlane. Most {{of the first day}} they {{remained}} in their suite, recovering from travel exhaustion. They soon <b>ventured</b> <b>out</b> to see to the Auteuil Hippodrome, and stopped by various concert halls.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{entered the}} 1966 FIFA World Cup as England's first choice goalkeeper, and his understudies Ron Springett and Peter Bonetti never {{took to the}} field during the tournament. England opened the tournament with a goalless draw against Uruguay, with Banks a virtual spectator as the highly {{defensive}} Uruguayans rarely <b>ventured</b> <b>out</b> of their own half. They then defeated Mexico 2–0, with Banks again rarely troubled throughout. A 2–0 win over France then took England through the group stage without Banks conceding a goal.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the Allies enjoyed air {{supremacy}} in North Africa. The Ju 87s <b>ventured</b> <b>out</b> in Rotte strength only, often jettisoning their bombs {{at the first}} sight of enemy aircraft. Adding to this trouble, the German fighters had only enough fuel to cover the Ju 87s on take off, their most vulnerable point. After that, the Stukas were on their own.|$|E

5|$|Following engagements at Bullecourt, the 5th Division—of {{which the}} 55th Battalion was part—spent {{four months in}} reserve, before moving into the Ypres sector in Belgium. Made a regular {{stretcher}} bearer, Corey was decorated with a bar to his Military Medal for his actions on 26 September during the Battle of Polygon Wood. While subject to heavy artillery and machine gun fire, he frequently <b>ventured</b> <b>out</b> into no-man's-land to tend to the wounded.|$|E

He also had started his own production company, Compound Entertainment, in 2007, and has hired several producers and songwriters in hopes of {{turning it into a}} full-fledged record label. It successfully became a label, and artists such as RaVaughn, Paula Campbell, Sixx John, Adrienne Bailon and Shanell are now associated with Compound.|$|E
5|$|Controlled {{experiments}} with colonies of Cerapachys biroi suggest {{that an individual}} may choose nest roles based on her previous experience. An entire generation of identical workers was {{divided into two groups}} whose outcome in food foraging was controlled. One group was continually rewarded with prey, while it was made certain that the other failed. As a result, members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group <b>ventured</b> <b>out</b> fewer and fewer times. A month later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in brood care.|$|E

5|$|Two notable events {{occurred}} on Wednesday, February 24. At some point that day, Bowie collapsed from illness, leaving Travis in sole {{command of the}} garrison. Late that afternoon, two Mexican scouts became the first fatalities of the siege. The following morning, 200–300 Mexican soldiers crossed the San Antonio River and took cover in abandoned shacks near the Alamo walls. Several Texians <b>ventured</b> <b>out</b> to burn the huts while Texians within the Alamo provided cover fire. After a two-hour skirmish, the Mexican troops retreated to Béxar. Six Mexican soldiers were killed and four others were wounded. No Texians were injured.|$|E
5|$|Amalfi {{immediately}} began listing to port and, after initial damage control efforts proved fruitless, her commander ordered the ship evacuated. The cruiser sank less than 30 minutes {{after she was}} torpedoed. Distress calls were answered by other ships of the division which rescued {{a large number of}} the ship's complement. The loss of men was reported as about 200 at the time, but later reports list only 67 fatalities. Amalfi was among the largest ships sunk by U-boats during the war. As a result of Amalfis sinking, sister ship Pisa and the other pair of armored cruisers at Venice rarely <b>ventured</b> <b>out</b> of port for most of the next year, and were eventually transferred to Valona in April 1916.|$|E
5|$|Restaurant menu: During {{the early}} Song Dynasty (960–1279), {{expanding}} trade and commerce brought money and {{people to the}} Song Chinese capital. The world's first restaurants sprang up and food like dumplings and noodles became available to the masses for a small price. Urban shopkeepers of the merchant middle class often had little time to eat at home, so they <b>ventured</b> <b>out</b> to eat {{at a variety of}} establishments such as temples, taverns, tea houses, food stalls, and restaurants which provided business for nearby brothels, singing-girl houses, and drama theaters; this along with traveling foreigners and Chinese who migrated to urban centers from regions with different cooking styles encouraged a demand for a variety of flavors served at urban restaurants, giving rise to the menu.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish {{government}} {{refused to}} abandon the area completely {{out of fear that}} such an action would make them appear weak. While they planned a response, Indians raided the San Saba horse herd, stealing all of the horses and pack mules and killing 20soldiers. In October 1759, Spain sent the San Sabá commander, Colonel Diego Ortiz Parrilla, on an expedition north to the Red River to avenge the attack. The tribes were forewarned and led Parrilla's army to a fortified Wichita village, surrounded by a stockade and a moat, where natives brandished French guns and waved a French flag. After a skirmish in which 52Spaniards were killed, wounded, or deserted, the Spanish retreated. The San Sabá presidio was replaced with a limestone fortress and a moat, but the Comanches and their allies remained close and killed any soldiers who <b>ventured</b> <b>out.</b> By 1769, Spain abandoned the fort.|$|E
5|$|From the start, one of {{the main}} efforts of the Confederate Navy was to counter the {{blockade}} of its ports by the Union Navy. Mallory believed that by attacking the merchant shipping that carried trade to Northern ports he could force his Union counterpart, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, to divert his own small fleet to defend against the raiders. In {{the early days of the}} war, the Confederacy tried to enlist the services of private shipowners in the service by offering letters of marque and reprisal. Issuance of the letters was not in the purview of the Navy Department, but Mallory was aware of them and saw them as part of his plan. For several reasons, the privateers did not have the success that was hoped for. Although they <b>ventured</b> <b>out</b> throughout the war, they had only fleeting success, and that had ceased by the end of the first year.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, 2002, Los Infernales won the Mexican National Trios Championship from Olímpico, Mr. Niebla and Safari. After {{they won}} the {{championship}} they began feuding with La Familia de Tijuana (Nicho el Millonario, Halloween and Damián 666). The trio lost the title to La Familia on September 27, 2002 but continued feuding into 2003. When Nicho stopped appearing for CMLL the trios championship was vacated but Los Infernales refused to take them without a match. This storyline led to an eight-team trios title tournament whichLos Infernales did not win. Instead Los Infernales did win a tournament to become the number one contenders for the CMLL World Trios Championship but lost to champions Black Tiger III, Dr. Wagner Jr. and Universo 2000 on August 1, 2003. At {{the end of the}} year, Averno and Mephisto turned on Satánico but there was little to feuding afterwards they split from the group and <b>ventured</b> <b>out</b> on their own. On February 4, 2004 Mephisto defeated El Satánico to win the CMLL World Welterweight Championship at CMLL’s home at Arena México.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{returning}} home, Pinocchio and Jiminy {{find the}} workshop vacant. They soon {{get a letter}} from the blue fairy as a dove, stating that Geppetto had <b>ventured</b> <b>out</b> in search of Pinocchio, but was swallowed by a giant sperm whale named Monstro, and is now living in his belly. Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the sea accompanied by Jiminy. Pinocchio is soon swallowed by Monstro as well, where he is reunited with Geppetto. Pinocchio devises a scheme to make Monstro sneeze, giving them a chance to escape. The scheme works, but the enraged whale chases them, and smashes their raft. Pinocchio pulls Geppetto to safety in a cave before Monstro crashes into it. They are all washed up on a beach on the other side. Geppetto and Jiminy survive, but Pinocchio lies motionless face down in a tide pool nearby. Back home, the group mourns him. The Blue Fairy, however, decides that Pinocchio has proven himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, that he is reborn as a real human boy (his donkey ears and tail also gone), and everyone celebrates. Jiminy steps outside to thank the Fairy, and is rewarded with a solid gold badge that certifies him as an official conscience.|$|E
