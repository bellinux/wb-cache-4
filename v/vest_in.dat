5|$|Drawing {{inspiration}} from the Mario series, Yoshizawa kept the same title but changed everything else; it became a platformer {{as opposed to a}} beat 'em up such as Double Dragon; the gameplay was modeled after Konami's Castlevania, with Ryu being equipped with a katana-like Dragon Sword, shurikens, and ninpo techniques such as fire wheels. In designing the protagonist Ryu Hayabusa, the development team wanted him to be unique from other ninjas. They designed him with a ninja <b>vest</b> <b>in</b> order to place emphasis on his muscles, and they furnished him with a cowl that arched outward. They originally wanted to equip Ryu with sensors and a helmet with an inside monitor to check his surroundings, but that idea was scrapped. According to Kato, they utilized specific locations and environments to justify the need for having a ninja for a main character.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} months after Gebhard's conversion, two {{competing}} armies rampaged throughout the southern portion of the Electoral territory {{in the destruction of}} the so-called Oberstift. Villages, abbeys and convents and several towns, were plundered and burned, by both sides; Linz am Rhein and Ahrweiler avoided destruction by swearing loyalty to Salentin. In the summer of 1583, Gebhard and Agnes took refuge, first at <b>Vest</b> <b>in</b> Vest Recklinghausen, a fief of the Electorate, and then in the Duchy of Westphalia, at Arensberg castle. In both territories, Gebhard set in motion as much of the Reformation as he could, although his soldiers indulged in a bout of iconoclasm and plundering.|$|E
5|$|West was {{the home}} plate umpire when rookie pitcher Clay Buchholz threw a no-hitter against the Baltimore Orioles on September 1, 2007, at Fenway Park; West called a curveball strike three for the final out. He worked his 4,000th career game on July 30, 2009, at Miller Park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; he ejected Washington Nationals manager Jim Riggleman from the contest. That same year he {{appeared}} in the American League Division Series and the World Series. He was also {{elected president of the}} World Umpires Association (WUA). West and the union's governing board negotiated the largest umpiring contract in the history of MLB. The contract ran from 2010 through the 2014 season. West designed the chest protector sold commercially as the West Vest, now marketed by Wilson Sporting Goods. He holds patents on the West <b>Vest</b> <b>in</b> the US, Australia, Canada and Japan. He also designed Wilson's high-end umpiring gear, the only umpiring equipment endorsed by MLB.|$|E

25|$|To {{enable the}} trustee to do this, the Act {{provides}} {{that the effect}} of a sequestration order is to divest the insolvent of his estate and <b>vest</b> it <b>in</b> the Master, and thereafter the trustee, once he has been appointed. If a provisional trustee is appointed, the estate <b>vests</b> <b>in</b> him before <b>vesting</b> <b>in</b> the trustee.|$|R

25|$|The American {{courts have}} been {{inconsistent}} between states and at Federal level. Under Danish law, all shipwrecks over 150 years old {{belong to the}} state if no owner can be found. In Spain, wrecks <b>vest</b> <b>in</b> the state if not salvaged within 3 years. In Finland, all property on board shipwrecks over 100 years old vests in the state.|$|E
25|$|Toad bears {{a similar}} {{appearance}} {{to the rest}} of his species with his large mushroom cap and clothes. He is very small in size, and has no legs visible, with just his typical brown shoes showing. Unlike other Toads, he features five red spots on his mushroom cap and wears a blue and yellow vest; however, his coloration will change if he gets a fire flower, as his cap's colors will be reversed while his clothes turn red. A yellow outline was added to his <b>vest</b> <b>in</b> the recent Mario games, starting with Super Mario Sunshine. Sometimes, Toad appears with a red vest, though he is most often seen with his blue <b>vest.</b> <b>In</b> the Mario cartoons, Toad has on occasion removed his mushroom cap, revealing three strands of hair; however, the games have never confirmed or refuted this. Toad is also seen with pants of a white color that resemble the base of a mushroom or toadstool stalk.|$|E

50|$|Politics of Tonga {{takes place}} in a {{framework}} of a constitutional monarchy, whereby the King is the Head of State and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. Tongas Prime Minister is currently appointed by the King from among the members of Parliament after having won the support of a majority of its members. Executive power is <b>vested</b> <b>in</b> the Cabinet of Ministers. Legislative power is <b>vested</b> <b>in</b> the King in Parliament, and judicial power is <b>vested</b> <b>in</b> the supreme court.|$|R
25|$|Some jurisdictions have {{ameliorated}} {{specific problems}} of the rule by creating statutory presumptions to counter those problems. Under such statutes, for example, a woman is presumed to no longer be fertile after a particular age (typically 55), and a gift to a person's widow or widower is presumed to <b>vest</b> <b>in</b> whoever was that person's spouse {{at the time of}} the gift.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} lifesaving {{services}} were formed that the personal safety of boat crews heading out in pulling boats in generally horrific sea conditions was addressed. The modern life jacket is generally credited to one Captain Ward, a Royal National Lifeboat Institution inspector in the United Kingdom, who created a cork <b>vest</b> <b>in</b> 1854 to be worn by lifeboat crews for both weather protection and buoyancy.|$|E
25|$|Laurent {{took a few}} steps, not speaking. He {{removed his}} jacket and <b>vest.</b> <b>In</b> shirtsleeves, he glanced again at Thérèse, who had not stirred. He seemed to hesitate. Then he noticed the pink shoulder, and bent down to press his {{trembling}} lips against that bit of bare skin. The young woman pulled her shoulder away, turning around abruptly. She stared at Laurent with a gaze so strangely mingling repugnance and dread that he stepped back, troubled and uneasy, as if overcome with terror and disgust himself.|$|E
5000|$|The Constitution {{features}} a distinct separation of powers. Legislative power is {{dealt with in}} Chapter I, and is <b>vested</b> <b>in</b> the Federal Parliament (section 1).

The judicature is dealt with in Chapter III, and is <b>vested</b> <b>in</b> the Federal High Court and [...] "in such other federal courts as the Parliament creates, and in such other courts as it invests with federal jurisdiction" [...] (section 71).|$|R

25|$|In general, {{women do}} not serve in the altar except in women's monasteries. In that case they do not receive the {{clerical}} tonsure (though they must be tonsured nuns), and do not <b>vest</b> <b>in</b> the sticharion, but wear their normal religious habit for attending services, and serve at a certain distance from the actual altar table. Normally, only older nuns may serve in the altar; but the Hegumenia (Abbess) is permitted to enter even if she is younger. A few parishes have begun to use women as altar servers.|$|E
25|$|Property {{inherited}} by an insolvent {{during his}} insolvency falls into his insolvent estate, notwithstanding a contrary {{provision in the}} testator’s will. However, if an insolvent refuses to accept property bequeathed to him or an insurance benefit of {{which he has been}} nominated as a beneficiary, the property or benefit in question does not <b>vest</b> <b>in</b> his estate. The reason is that the insolvent merely has a competence or power to accept the bequest or nomination, and he acquires no right to the property or benefit until he has accepted. An insolvent may, thus, by repudiating a legacy, inheritance or insurance benefit, ensure that it passes to someone other than the trustee and the creditors of his insolvent estate.|$|E
25|$|On weekdays {{that are}} not major feasts Vespers {{features}} hardly any ceremonies and the celebrant wears the usual choir dress. However, on Sundays and greater feasts Vespers may be solemn. Solemn Vespers differ in that the celebrant wears the cope, he is assisted by assistants also in copes, incense is used, and two acolytes, a thurifer, {{and at least one}} master of ceremonies are needed. On ordinary Sundays only two assistants are needed while on greater feasts four or six assistants may be used. The celebrant and assistants <b>vest</b> <b>in</b> the surplice and the cope, which is of the color of the day. The celebrant sits at the sedile, in front of which is placed a lectern, covered with a cloth in the color of the day. The assistants sit on benches or stools facing the altar, or if there are two assistants, they may sit at the sedile next to the celebrant (the first assistant in the place of the deacon and the second assistant in place of the subdeacon).|$|E
50|$|A main {{distinction}} between various democratic governments {{is the relationship}} between the legislature and the executive. In parliamentary systems, the executive power is generally <b>vested</b> <b>in</b> individual members of the legislature; the prime minister and cabinet. In a presidential system, the executive power is <b>vested</b> <b>in</b> an elected president.|$|R
50|$|In theory, the UK's supreme {{legislative}} power is <b>vested</b> <b>in</b> the Crown-in-Parliament. However, the Crown normally acts {{on the advice}} of the Prime Minister and the powers of the House of Lords are limited to delaying legislation; thus power is de facto <b>vested</b> <b>in</b> the House of Commons.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Bill of Rights {{approved by}} the House of Representatives included a Sixteenth Article, which stated that [...] "(t)he powers delegated by the Constitution {{to the government of}} the United States, shall be exercised as therein appropriated, so that the Legislative shall never exercise the powers <b>vested</b> <b>in</b> the Executive or Judicial; nor the Executive the powers <b>vested</b> <b>in</b> the Legislative or Judicial; nor the Judicial the powers <b>vested</b> <b>in</b> the Legislative or Executive."

2500|$|The {{variations}} in design, cut, and cloth, such as two- and three- piece, or single- and double- breasted, determine {{the social and}} work suitability of the garment. Often, suits are worn, as is traditional, with a collared shirt and necktie. [...] Until around the 1960s, as with all men's clothes, a hat would have been also worn when the wearer was outdoors. Suits also come with different numbers of pieces: a two-piece suit has a jacket and the trousers; a three piece adds a waistcoat (known as a <b>vest</b> <b>in</b> North America); further pieces might include a flat cap made from the same cloth.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} Church, before someone {{could be a}} server {{he had to be}} tonsured. Nowadays, in many places it is not {{necessary}} to be tonsured before one is allowed to serve (since the tonsure must be done by a bishop or higher-ranking priest). The rites of [...] "Setting Aside a Taper-bearer" [...] and [...] "Tonsuring a Reader" [...] have now been combined into one service. It is the custom in some traditions, such as the Greek Orthodox or Melkite Catholic, to allow tonsured altar servers to also <b>vest</b> <b>in</b> the orarion, worn crossed over the back like that of a subdeacon but with the ends hanging parallel in front. Among the Russians, however, the orarion is not usually worn by servers, but only by duly ordained subdeacons and deacons, with the exception that laymen who are blessed to perform some of the functions of subdeacons may sometimes be blessed to wear the orar.|$|E
2500|$|Disputes as {{to whether}} or not to {{classify}} something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art. Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included cubist and impressionist paintings, Duchamp's Fountain, the movies, superlative imitations of banknotes, conceptual art, and video games. Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem. Rather, [...] "the passionate concerns and interests that humans <b>vest</b> <b>in</b> their social life" [...] are [...] "so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art" [...] (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the Daily Mail criticized Hirst's and Emin's work by arguing [...] "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all" [...] they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work. In 1998, Arthur Danto, suggested a thought experiment showing that [...] "the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities. Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood." ...|$|E
