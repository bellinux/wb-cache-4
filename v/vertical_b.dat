The APOGEE data reveal that the bulge is cylindrically rotating across all latitudes and is kinematically hottest {{at the very center}} of the bulge, with the smallest gradients in both kinematic and chemical space inside the innermost region (<b>vertical</b> bar l, <b>b</b> <b>vertical</b> bar) (5 degrees, 5 degrees). The results from APOGEE show good agreement with data from other surveys at higher latitudes and a remarkable similarity to the rotation and dispersion maps of barred galaxies viewed edge-on.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} work {{carried out}} by the University of Washington’s Cloud and Aerosol Research Group during the past year on the interactions of nitrogen species with clouds. The principle conclusions that have emerged from our analyses of the field data collected during the past year, together with data collected in the previous two years, are: Nitrate production commonly occurs in clouds, and at times it is a source for nitrate in clouds that is comparable to that which derives from the scavenging of pre-existing nitrates. However, nitrate production in clouds is highly variable and {{does not appear to be}} either as frequent or as substantial as sulfate production. The efficiencies with which nitrogen species are scavenged by clouds is strongly influenced by the precipitation formation mechanism and, in particular, by the presence and growth mechanisms for ice and snow. A possible mechanism for nitrate production in clouds is the interstitial formation of N 03 and N 205. Although our data set is not inconsistent with this mechanism, it is not extensive or definitive enough to confirm it.

The analogous maximum absorption feature for arylperoxyl radicals is predicted to shift to the visible but has not previously been characterized nor have any photoproducts arising from this transition been identified. Here we describe the controlled synthesis and isolation in vacuo of an array of charge-substituted phenylperoxyl radicals at room temperature, including the 4 -(N,N,N-trimethylammonium) methyl phenylperoxyl radical cation (4 -Me 3 N[+]CH 2 -C 6 H 4 OO center dot), using linear ion-trap mass spectrometry. Photodissociation mass spectra obtained at wavelengths ranging from 310 to 500 nm reveal two major photoproduct channels corresponding to homolysis of aryl-OO and arylO-O bonds resulting in loss of O- 2 and O, respectively. Combining the photodissociation yields across this spectral window produces a broad (FWHM approximate to 60 nm) but clearly resolved feature centered at lambda(max) = 403 nm (3. 08 eV).

This shows that dip-slip faulting is compatible with vertical P or Taxes, but does not require it, and instead requires horizontal B axes. It also shows that strike-slip faulting does not require <b>vertical</b> <b>B</b> axes, but P and Taxes with equal plunges. This also reveals that focal mechanisms where P, B, and Taxes all have moderate plunge correspond to two very different types of nodal planes: a steeply dipping one with oblique slip and a moderately dipping one with strike-slip.

The purpose of this work is to design an optimized RF transmit phase gradient array for spatial encoding in a transverse direction (x- or y- axis) for a 0. 2 T <b>vertical</b> <b>B</b> 0 field MRI system, using a single transmitter channel. This requires the generation of two transmit B 1 RF fields with uniform amplitude and positive and negative linear phase gradients respectively over the imaging volume. Materials and Methods: A two-element array consisting of a double Maxwell-type coil and a Helmholtz-type coil was designed using 3 D field simulations. The phase gradient polarity is set by the relative phase of the RF signals driving the simultaneously energized elements. Results: Field mapping and 1 D TRASE imaging experiments confirmed that the constructed coil produced the fields and operated as designed. A substantially larger imaging volume relative to that obtainable from a non-optimized Maxwell-Helmholtz design was achieved. Conclusion: The Maxwell (sine) -Helmholtz (cosine) approach has proven successful for a horizontal phase gradient coil.

Design/methodology/approach - This issue was explored with a case study of the standardisation activity in the Port Community of Barcelona. The primary source of data was semi-structured interviews with members of the standardisation committee, direct observation in meetings and related documentation.
