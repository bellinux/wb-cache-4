40|$|The {{automotive}} {{cooling system}} is {{a significant part of}} the car that removes the engine generated heat outside across the radiator. The increasing demand of nanofluids for industrial applications has led many researchers to focus on the subject in the last decade. The limited thermophysical properties and heat transfer fo liquids across the car radiator have resulted in much research to find better coolant fluids. Space constraints are another key issue in the evofofotua applications to remove heat from high heat flux generating surfaces of automobile engines. In order to improve thermophysical properties of the coolant fluid to enhance heat transfer in the automotive cooling system, nanofluids have been utilized as a coolant. This study aims to enhance heat transfer with a slight pressure drop in the automotive cooling system by using multi types of nanoparticles dispersed in various types of basefluids. The appropriate type of nanofluids and the influence of different nanofluids on the heat transfer performance for the car cooling system have been identified. The radiator performance efficiency to reduce the radiator size and weight has been studied. The friction factor and heat transfer enhancement using different types of nanofluids are studied. The TiO 2 and SiO 2 nanopowders suspended in four different base fluids (pure water, EG, 10 %EG+ 90 %W and 20 %EG+ 80 %W) are prepared experimentally. The thermophysical properties of both nanofluids and base fluids have been measured and validated with the standard and the experimental data available. The experimental test rig setup included a car radiator, collecting tank, pump, rotameter, valves and plastic tubes. The evaluation of the friction factor and heat transfer coefficient by taking readings of the temperature and pressure drop under laminar flow condition were conducted. The <b>volume</b> <b>flowrate</b> was found to be in the range of (1 - 5 LPM) for pure water and (3 - 12 LPM) for other base fluids; while, the inlet temperature and nanofluid volume fraction were in the range of (60 - 80 oC) and (1 - 4 %) respectively. The CFD analysis for the nanofluids flow inside the flat tube of a car radiator under laminar flow was carried out. A simulation study was conducted by using the finite volume oaotfm to solve the continuity, momentum, and energy equations. The geometry meshing of problem with a description of the boundary conditions was performed by using commercial software to determine the friction factor and heat transfer coefficient. The experimental results showed the friction factor decreased with the increase of the <b>volume</b> <b>flowrate</b> and increased with the increase of nanofluid volume fraction but slightly decreased with the increase of the inlet temperature. The simulation results showed good agreement with the experimental data with deviation not exceeding 4 %. The experimental results showed the heat transfer coefficient increased with the increase of the <b>volume</b> <b>flowrate,</b> the nanofluid volume fraction and the inlet temperature. The simulation results showed good agreement with the experimental data with deviation not exceeding 6 %. In addition, the SiO 2 nanofluid showed higher values of the friction factor and heat transfer coefficient than TiO 2 nanofluid. The base fluid (20 %EG+ 80 %W) gave higher values of the heat transfer coefficient and proper values of friction factor compared to other base fluids. The 4 % of SiO 2 nanoparticles suspended in (20 %EG+ 80 %W) base fluid was significant augmentation of heat transfer in the automobile radiator. The regression equations among input (Reynolds number, Prandtl number, and nanofluid volume fraction) and response (friction factor and Nusselt number) were found to be correlated.

40|$|The {{constant}} volume sampling (CVS) {{method has}} been used to support vehicle emissions testing for over 25 years and the ‘bag’ measurement of emissions is the key method that is used for legislative purposes. Bag measurements provide a single figure for CO, CO 2, and NOx emissions species for the complete drive cycle, but provide no information on the profile throughout the test. Instantaneous emissions measurements undertaken on a second-by-second basis are carried out to assess catalyst and engine system performance. The key measurement for this approach is the determination of the instantaneous exhaust mass flowrate, which allows the instantaneous gravimetric emissions to be calculated. Being able to accurately measure instantaneous emissions carries its own challenges, but the mixing effects in the CVS system when using the CO 2 tracer technique have been shown to compromise significantly the capability to determine exhaust <b>volume</b> <b>flowrates</b> accurately. The predicted time responses of dilute CO 2 concentration, and the resulting over-underestimate of tailpipe volume flow, display adequate agreement with experimental results.

40|$|This Thesis {{describes}} {{the application of}} a non-destructive pulsed proton NMR method mainly to measure water transport in the xylem vessels of plant stems and in some model systems. The results are equally well applicable to liquid flow in other biological objects than plants, e. g. flow of blood and other body fluids in human and animals (Chapter 8). The method is based on a pulse sequence of equidistant πpulses in combination with a linear magnetic field gradient G. Following a general introduction and a survey of the properties of water in plants (Chapters 1 and 2), the basic NMR theory as well as reviews on the application of pulsed NMR to the determination of flow, diffusion and water content are presented in chapter 3. A mathematical treatment has produced analytical expressions for the shape of the signal S(t), based on a model in which the flowing fluid is thought to receive a ½π-τ-(π-τ-) n pulse train: a ½πpulse upon entering the r. f. coil followed by a sequence of equidistant πpulses until the fluid leaves the coil; simultaneously, this movement. of the fluid along a magnetic field gradient applied in the direction of flow produces a phase shift of the nuclear magnetization with respect to the rotating frame of reference (Chapter 4). Although this model does not lead to perfect agreement between the experimental and theoretical signal shape S(t), it correctly predicts the effects of experimental parameters on S(t) via analytical expressions. The main results from this theoretical treatment in combination with computer simulations, which have been experimentally verified in glass capillary systems, are:- as long as T 2 ≥ ½T 1 , the mean linear flow velocity v can be found from the time t max at which a maximum appears in the signal shape: v=C/t max, where C is a calibration constant, depending on G, τand the flow profile. If T 2 &lt;½T 1 v can only be reliably determined when both T 1 and T 2 of the flowing fluid are known. - T 2 and the amount of flowing water in the coil V, and consequently the <b>volume</b> <b>flowrate</b> Q, can be determined from the height of the maximum S(t max) and t max. Depending on the value of T 2 and the value of the ratio T 1 /T 2 , T 2 and V are found from a semilog plot of either S(t max) vs. t max (T 1 >>T 2 ) or ∂[S(t max) . t max]/∂t max vs. t max (T 1 ≈ T 2 ). Based on flow measurements in plant stem segments (Chapter 5) {{it has been suggested that}} T 2 strongly depends on the vessel diameter for the narrow xylem capillaries. This behaviour of T 2 can explain negative results in plant stems with small vessel diameter. Under the present experimental conditions the method has been successfully applied to Cucurbitaceae (cucumber, gherkin, pumpkin) and tomato plants. T 2 measurements in wheat leaves have been shown to be insensitive to the presence of cell-bound paramagnetic ions (Chapter 7). The magnitude of T 2 of two separate water fractions (covering - 90 % of the total water content) has been found to be inversely proportional to water content. Measurements of flow and water content have been combined for an intact gherkin plant (Chapter 5), demonstrating that the combination of both NMR methods results in a powerful non-invasive method to study important parts of the plant water balance simultaneously. The results strongly suggest that the method can be used as an early warning for development of stress phenomena in plants, due to drought and other factors. From the flow measurements it has been shown how in a plant system the values of T 2 and T 1 of the water in the xylem vessels can be determined and estimated, respectively. A comparison between the results obtained with NMR, heat pulse and weight balance flow measurements is presented in Chapter 6. A linear relationship between the linear flow velocity obtained by NMR and the <b>volume</b> <b>flowrate</b> determined by the balance method yields an effective cross-sectional area available for flow of ~ 50 % of the cross-sectional area of the xylem vessels measured by using a microscope. NMR measurements alone yield a slightly lower value of the effective cross-sectional area. Compared with the NMR method, the heat pulse method monitors only relative changes in the flow velocity. A plot of the flow velocity obtained by the heat pulse method versus the <b>volume</b> <b>flowrate</b> obtained by the balance method exhibits some unwanted experimental scatter. Chapter 8 suggests some applications of the pulsed NMR flow method, also to other systems than plants, and defines important instrumental requirements for these applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{combustion}} generated {{noise in}} gas turbine engines is a barrier for further reduction in engine noise emissions. Combustion-generated oscillations interact with hardware {{and lead to}} combustion instabilities, performance degradation or structural damage. These engines employ dual- and multi-swirlers, and various degree of partial premixing. Motivated by these, the effect of partial premixing on sound generation was investigated for jet flames, and advanced combustor design based swirling flames. The effect of swirler configuration on noise generated by swirling flows and flames was explored. For jet flames, the effect of partial premixing was investigated by keeping fuel flowrate constant with gradual air addition and also with constant overall <b>volume</b> <b>flowrate.</b> For swirling flames, fuel was gradually added with constant air flowrate. Narrowband spectral measurements were obtained. ^ The {{results indicate that the}} equivalence ratio plays a stronger role in combustion generated noise than the Reynolds number, Mach number, and firing rate. The partial premixing affects the sound generation primarily through impact on flame structure and combustion volume. The effect on sound generation depends on the stoichiometric air requirement of fuel. This results in a more pronounced effect in methane flames compared to ethane and ethylene flames because of lower stoichiometric air requirement of methane. Combustion affects high frequencies due to its effect on velocity field. Unlike premixed flames, swirling partially premixed flames strongly amplify upstream generated low frequency tones with their relative amplification a function of swirler configuration. The co-rotating double swirler configuration generates less noisy flames than single and counter-rotating double swirler configurations and thus is preferable. The addition of a second swirler reduces precession speed of precessing vortex core (PVC) and weakens its structure, with counter-rotation having a stronger impact. This explains the widest stability limit of counter-rotating double swirler configuration. The swirling flow spectra are dominated by high amplitude PVC tones which collapse at one Strouhal number termed as characteristic Strouhal number (Stch). The acoustically determined Stch can be used to determine the effective Swirl number of complex swirler configurations. The acoustic spectral analysis may be used for detection of flow anomalies in swirling flows and flames. ...|$|E

Water supply accounts for 4 % of U. S. total energy consumption and water heating consumes 14 % of household energy. However, water and energy conservation programs are often not collaboratively planed. Further, city-wide water and energy use and conservation estimates assume deterministic (homogenous) household characteristics and often do not include uncertainties in water and energy system parameters. Here, we present a stochastic simulation-optimization model that considers uncertainties and variability in household water and energy use and conservation. The model also embeds the city’s energy consumption to extract, convey, treat and distribute water to households, and treat wastewater. At the household scale, water and energy use are modeled stochastically using Monte Carlo simulation by considering the likelihood of each value water and energy parameter can take (i. e., probability distributions of use frequency and duration, use <b>volume</b> or <b>flowrate,</b> household size, hot water use percentage, water heater efficiency, etc.) for major household toilet, shower, faucet, clothes-washers, dishwasher, and outdoor water uses. We develop probability distributions for model parameters from a recent, large, national, disaggregated water use dataset comprising 1. 4 million water use events over 7, 900 days by 400 single family households in 11 U.

The analysis reveals that the energy intensity (kilowatt hour/million gallons [KWh/MG] for water supply systems varies widely from 820 to 12, 700 KWh/MG depending on the water source type (surface or groundwater), quality, distance from demand location, city topography, wastewater effluent standards, and treatment technology. The analysis shows that overlooking the water-energy linkages in water supply decisions may lead to very high energy intensity like in Southern California where water is conveyed hundreds of miles and with huge pumping lifts from both northern California and the Colorado River to the demand location. At the household scale, we are investigating the range of behavioral (use frequency and duration), demographical (household size), and technological (use <b>volume</b> or <b>flowrate)</b> factors that affect residential water uses and therefore energy consumption though hot water use in the showerhead, laundry machine, dishwasher, and faucet. We are also considering the energy embedded to extract, treat, convey, and distribute water for toilet flushing and to irrigate outdoor landscaping. The analysis is being made with detailed, disaggregated end use data that was previously collected by the USEPA as part of a retrofit study of 100 single family households in Seattle WA, Oakland CA, and Tampa FL between the period from 2000 and 2003. We will use household and city scale energy-water data to build a simulation optimization model that seeks to minimize costs for water, energy, and retrofits at the household and city scales while meeting specified conservation targets. The model decision variables are to select and size water conservation actions targeted to particular residential end uses. The model also is subject to constraints of water use, energy use, and financial budgets to implement conservation measures. The simulation/optimization model will allow water mangers to better quantify water, energy, and money saved from water conservation actions and select and size these actions...|$|R
40|$|Background: Electronic {{cigarettes}} are battery powered nicotine vaporizers built with {{a heating element}} that atomizes an e-liquid solution. Studies have been conducted to understand user nicotine exposure however, replicating realistic use patterns, puff topography, is necessary to conduct accurate emissions studies. Previous {{studies have been conducted}} in the laboratory environment using the CReSS Micro System however, this instrument has limitations making it impractical to measure natural use behavior. The Wireless Personal Use Monitor (wPUM), developed at RIT can overcome the CReSS limitations to capture usage behavior in the natural environment. The wPUM was deployed in 2015 to measure the usage behavior for 20 electronic cigarette users for one week in the natural environment. The study reported anomalies in the subjects’ data files which was later found to have impacted the wPUM performance. Results of this study prompted the team at RIT to investigate the performance of the wPUM under different conditions in a controlled environment. Goal: The goal of this research is to validate that the wPUM is capable of gathering electronic cigarette topography data under various controlled conditions and to characterize the wPUM’s working range. Methods: The wPUM was tested utilizing RIT’s Programmable Emissions System (PES) to drive the desired puffing topography. Puffing characteristics varied to determine the wPUM’s working range for puff duration, <b>volume,</b> period and <b>flowrate.</b> Standard profiles were also tested including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) / International Organization of Standardization (ISO) Standard, the Massachusetts Department Public Health Standard, and the Health Canada Intense (HCI) Regimen Standard. Each test was performed with three electronic cigarette brands under dry and condensation conditions. Results: The results of this study show that the wPUM is capable of detecting variable puffing topography under various testing conditions and environments. It is a reliable device for capturing data in the natural environment...|$|R
40|$|Bioprinting is a {{manufacturing}} process that constructs devices {{from the bottom}} up by layering biomaterials in precise patterns. At Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, bioprinting is performed using extrusion 3 D printing, a process that uses pressure to drive the biomaterials through a syringe and on to a printing stage. These biomaterials are typically gel solutions with cells growing within. One drawback of these gels is that they are visco-elastic and non-Newtonian. This means that the mechanical properties of the gels change depending on the applied pressure. This variance in mechanical properties makes it harder to control the flow of these materials when the pressure applied changes leading to inconsistent dispensing. High precision dispensing is necessary to form the intricate microfluidic devices that are being developed at the lab. These materials also undergo a phase change during the printing process, further complicating the issue. To mitigate these issues, the lab aims to design a pressure feedback system that uses data from a flow sensor to control the pressure pumps to maintain desired flowrates. The lab was already in possession of calorimetric microfluidic flow meters used for other purposes; however, the accuracy of these sensors was unknown with visco-elatic materials. To verify the accuracy of these sensors, a test was developed to compare the flow sensor data with the actual flow rate. Gelatin solution was driven under constant pressure through the sensor and dispensed onto a mass balance. Using various conversions, data for <b>volume</b> accumulation and <b>flowrate</b> were obtained from both the mass balance and the flow sensor. The data from the flow sensor was compared to the data from the mass balance, which measured the true flowrate, to check for inconsistencies...|$|R
