40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{identify}} and quantify the <b>volatile</b> <b>compounds</b> in five different commercial brands of charqui and longaniza sausages. <b>Volatile</b> <b>compounds</b> were extracted from some samples headspace using solid phase microextraction (SPME).

Fifty-four <b>volatile</b> <b>compounds</b> were identified in charqui samples and thirty-two <b>volatile</b> <b>compounds</b> in longaniza sausages. The chemical groups of the <b>volatile</b> <b>compounds</b> found in both the products were: aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, organic acids, furans, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of heating, fiber type used in solid-phase microextraction (SPME, two phase vs three phase) and storage time on the <b>volatile</b> <b>compounds</b> of porcine M. longissimus dorsi (LD). <b>Volatile</b> <b>compounds</b> were measured using a gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with a quadrupole mass analyzer. Among the <b>volatile</b> <b>compounds</b> identified, aldehydes (49. 33 %), alcohols (24. 63 %) and ketones (9. 85 %) were higher in pre-heated loins (100 oC/ 30 min), whereas, alcohols (34. 33 %), hydrocarbons (22. 84 %) and ketones (16. 88 %) were higher in non-heated loins. Heating of loins induced the formation of various <b>volatile</b> <b>compounds</b> such as aldehydes (hexanal) and alcohols. The total contents of hydrocarbons, alcohols, and carboxylic acids were higher in two phase fibers, whereas those of esters tended to be higher in three-phase fibers (p< 0. 05). Most <b>volatile</b> <b>compounds</b> increased (p< 0. 05) with increased storage time. Thus, the analysis of <b>volatile</b> <b>compounds</b> were affected by the fiber type, while heating and refrigerated storage of pork M. longissimus dorsi increased the <b>volatile</b> <b>compounds</b> derived from lipid oxidation and amino acid catabolism, respectively.

5|$|The {{team from}} the University of Mainz were {{planning}} to study the electrodeposition of hassium atoms using the new TASCA facility at the GSI. Their aim was to use the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,4n)270Hs. In addition, scientists at the GSI were hoping to utilize TASCA to study the synthesis and properties of the hassium(II) compound hassocene, Hs(C5H5)2, using the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,xn). This compound {{is analogous to the}} lighter ferrocene, ruthenocene, and osmocene, and is expected to have the two cyclopentadienyl rings in an eclipsed conformation like ruthenocene and osmocene and not in a staggered conformation like ferrocene. Hassocene was chosen because it has hassium in the low formal oxidation state of +2 (although the bonding between the metal and the rings is mostly covalent in metallocenes) rather than the high +8 state which had previously been investigated, and relativistic effects were expected to be stronger in the lower oxidation state. Many metals in the periodic table form metallocenes, so that trends could be more easily determined, and the highly symmetric structure of hassocene and its low number of atoms also make relativistic calculations easier. Hassocene should be a stable and highly <b>volatile</b> <b>compound.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{individuals}} do, in fact, have a 2100-to-1 partition {{ratio in}} accordance with William Henry's law, which states that when the water solution of a <b>volatile</b> <b>compound</b> is brought into equilibrium with air, there is a fixed ratio between the concentration of the compound in air and its concentration in water. This ratio is constant at a given temperature. The human body is 37 degrees Celsius on average. Breath leaves the mouth at a temperature of 34 degrees Celsius. Alcohol in the body obeys Henry's Law {{as it is a}} <b>volatile</b> <b>compound</b> and diffuses in body water. To ensure that variables such as fever and hypothermia could not be pointed out to influence the results {{in a way that was}} harmful to the accused, the instrument is calibrated at a ratio of 2100:1, underestimating by 9 percent. In order for a person running a fever to significantly overestimate, he would have to have a fever that would likely see the subject in the hospital rather than driving in the first place. Studies suggest that about 1.8% of the population have a partition ratio below 2100:1. Thus, a machine using a 2100-to-1 ratio could actually overestimate the BAC. As much as 14% of the population has a partition ratio above 2100, thus causing the machine to under-report the BAC. Further, the assumption that the test subject's partition ratio will be average—that there will be 2100 parts in the blood for every part in the breath—means that accurate analysis of a given individual's blood alcohol by measuring breath alcohol is difficult, as the ratio varies considerably.|$|E
25|$|Heating {{an ideal}} mixture of two {{volatile}} substances A and B (with A having the higher volatility, or lower boiling point) in a batch distillation setup (such as in an apparatus {{depicted in the}} opening figure) {{until the mixture is}} boiling results in a vapor above the liquid which contains a mixture of A and B. The ratio between A and B in the vapor will be different from the ratio in the liquid: the ratio in the liquid will be determined by how the original mixture was prepared, while the ratio in the vapor will be enriched in the more <b>volatile</b> <b>compound,</b> A (due to Raoult's Law, see above). The vapor goes through the condenser and is removed from the system. This in turn means that the ratio of compounds in the remaining liquid is now different from the initial ratio (i.e., more enriched in B than the starting liquid).|$|E
