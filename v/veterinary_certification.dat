50|$|TRACES, or Trade Control and Expert System, is {{a web-based}} {{veterinarian}} certification tool {{used by the}} European Union for controlling the import and export of live animals and animal products within and without its borders. Its network falls under {{the responsibility of the}} European Commission. TRACES constitutes a key element of how the European Union facilitates trade and improves health protection for the consumer, as laid down in the First Pillar principle. Other countries use computer networks to provide <b>veterinary</b> <b>certification,</b> but TRACES is the only supranational network in the world working at a continental scale of 28 countries and almost 500 million people.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea about}} the {{foundation}} of a veterinary medical faculty in Bulgaria emerges because of the need of <b>veterinary</b> <b>certification</b> of livestock production and export combined with the impossibility to ensure the needed number of veterinary professionals by tuition in foreign veterinary medicine universities. The proposal was first brought up in 1897, and, after several unsuccessful attempts, was resurrected again after the First World War. The moving force of this process is the Association of Veterinary Professionals in Bulgaria. The government of Alexander Stambolijski has made the first decisive steps in this respect, by submitting a bill in the 19th Ordinary National Assembly. The bill was presented by Stoyan Omarchevski, Minister of Public Education. Thus, in 1921, the amendment to the Public Education Act reglamented {{the foundation of a}} Faculty of Veterinary Medicine with 9 departments, as the 7th faculty of the Sofia University. The Act was approved with a Decree 145 from July 11, 1921 signed by His Majesty Boris III. That is how the idea for foundation of a Faculty of Veterinary Medicine became a juridical act. Nevertheless, the practical implementation of the idea was a continuous process, accompanied by many difficulties, efforts and professional self-denial in the name of strengthening of Bulgarian higher veterinary medical education.|$|E
40|$|The {{emergency}} and casualty slaughter of cattle {{for human consumption}} (in cases where animals {{are likely to have}} suffered from acute or chronic pain, respectively) in Ireland requires that the animal is accompanied to the slaughterhouse by an official veterinary certificate (VC) completed on-farm by the owner 2 ̆ 7 s private veterinary practitioner (PVP). No published data is currently available in Ireland based on information provided in these VCs. In this paper, we present a review of bovine cases consigned under <b>veterinary</b> <b>certification</b> to {{emergency and}} casualty slaughter in Ireland during 2006 to 2008. All VCs during the years 2006 (where available), 2007 and 2008 were collected from four large Irish slaughterhouses. The data were computerized, and analysed using descriptive and spatial methods. In total, 1, 255 VCs were enrolled into the study (1, 255 study animals, 1, 072 study herds), 798 (63. 6...|$|E

40|$|Veterinary {{studies in}} Germany are {{regulated}} by the <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Certification</b> Act (TAppV). The practical part of the education consists of 1, 170 hours, whereby up to 850 hours can be spent on the curative work placement. A curative work placement can result in physical and psychological stress {{in the sense of}} a professional overload. It is the aim of this study to find out in what areas and to what extent competence is acquired and psychological stress exists in students during their work placement. Veterinary students (n= 142) from all German education institutes participated in a voluntary online-study based on Burnout Screening Scales (BOSS) as well as a questionnaire regarding the acquisition of competence and excessive stress during the work placement (FKÜP). The distribution of values for work placement related stress show that such work placement related stress is generally slightly increased (T= 60) and lies above that of occupational stresses within the normal population. Work placement related physical complaints also show a significant slight increase (T= 61). A value (T= 42) within the normal range was determined for the resource values. Few of the students questioned considered themselves to be excessively stressed in favour of a high subjective acquisition of competences. The largest increase regarding the acquisition of competence was noted for the areas of animal handling/restraint and application and injection techniques. In the sense of a perceived excessive demand regarding practical capabilities the areas of emergency management, surgery and medication dispensation were mentioned. With regard to the load structure and the acquisition of competence by veterinary students during their work placement, more support of the individual and a balancing of teaching/learning goals would be desirable and represents a promising approach...|$|E
40|$|Assessing {{the risk}} of disease {{introduction}} in imports THERE is a continual low risk of the introduction of an exotic disease into the UK and the EU from an affected region, such as Africa, the Middle East and Central/East Asia, but occasionally that risk level can be raised when a particularly high-risk route becomes more prominent. For example, if migratory wild birds with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were reported in northern Europe, {{the risk of}} an incursion of HPAI into the UK poultry industry may be increased, depending on the species of bird and the migration season. Likewise, an outbreak of disease in domestic livestock in a country from which the UK imports that species will trigger an increase in risk. Defra currently considers {{that there would be}} a negligible risk of an exotic disease being introduced from an affected country through legal imports because of the system of approval and certification laid down in EU law for countries approved for export to the EU. Before a non-EU country is approved to export, it must have an acceptable disease status, the recognised standard for relevant control authorities, and guarantees regarding compliance with EU import rules. All live animals and products of animal origin (POAO) imported from non-EU countries must be accompanied by <b>veterinary</b> <b>certification.</b> Such imports are checked at approved facilities at Border Inspection Posts. However, there would be an increased risk of disease introduction if, for some reason, the certification process had failed, either due to fraud or if an infected consignment was certified in good faith before the disease was detected in the country of origin. The International Disease Monitoring team at Defra was first set up after the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in the UK, with an aim to horizon scan for new threats to the UK livestock population. It uses official disease reports from around the world to monitor disease risk and trends in new and emerging diseases. These reports come fro...|$|E

50|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, {{following}} the development of modern veterinary medicine and food safety, European states have built, in parallel with customs structures, veterinary inspection stations located at the borders known as Border Inspection Posts. There all goods of animal origin including live animals are checked in order to avoid outbreaks of zoonoses and epizooties. Following the development of office computerisation and computer networking in the '80s, many countries started to think about <b>veterinary</b> computer <b>certification.</b>|$|R
50|$|Anatomical {{pathology}} (Commonwealth) or Anatomic pathology (U.S.) {{is concerned}} with the diagnosis of disease based on the gross examination, microscopic, and molecular examination of organs, tissues, and whole bodies (necropsy). The Indian, European, Japanese and American Colleges of Veterinary Pathologists certify veterinary pathologists through a certifying exam. The American College of <b>Veterinary</b> Pathologist <b>certification</b> exam consists of four parts - gross pathology, microscopic pathology, veterinary pathology, and general pathology. Only the general pathology section is shared between the anatomic and clinical pathology examinations. Anatomic pathologists are employed {{in a number of different}} positions, including diagnostics, teaching, research, and the pharmaceutical industry.|$|R
5000|$|Clinical {{pathology}} {{is concerned}} with the diagnosis of disease based on the laboratory analysis of bodily fluids such as blood, urine or cavitary effusions, or tissue aspirates using the tools of chemistry, microbiology, hematology and molecular pathology. The Indian, European, Japanese and American Colleges of Veterinary Pathologists certify veterinary clinical pathologists. The American College of <b>Veterinary</b> Pathologists <b>certification</b> exam consists of four parts: General Pathology (shared with the Anatomic Pathology certifying examination), Cytology and Surgical Pathology, Hematology, and Clinical Chemistry. The credential, DACVP (Diplomate, American College of Veterinary Pathologists) is usually followed by a parenthetical notation of [...] "(Clinical Pathology)" [...] to distinguish DACVP counterparts certified for anatomic pathology. The European credential is DipECVCP (Diplomate of the European College of Veterinary Clinical Pathology). Clinical pathologists are employed in diagnostic pathology, veterinary and medical teaching, research, and the pharmaceutical industry.|$|R

40|$|Pathologists (ACVP) {{believe that}} the ACVP {{certifying}} exami-nation is an excellent process for recognizing entry-level competency in veterinary clinical pathology and veterinary anatomic pathology; indeed, some individuals {{believe that it is}} the most rigorous and best-designed certification process within the veterinary medical specialties. Recent changes include allowing anatomic pathology candidates to choose modules in the Veterinary Pathology section, elimination of the Toxicologic Pathology module within the Veterinary Pathol-ogy section, use of digital images instead of Kodachrome slides, and spreading the examination over a 3 -day period. These modifications have not changed the structure, format, or grading of the examination or provided for objective evalua-tion of current certification processes. The ACVP leadership is discussing strategies to evaluate and validate the current certi-fication process. These actions are necessary to demonstrate that the ACVP certifying examinations are fair, relevant to cur-rent entry-level practice, and compliant with current published standards for excellence in professional certification. To remain a leader in <b>veterinary</b> specialty <b>certification,</b> the College must critically evaluate all aspects of its certification process. To achieve these ends, {{it is important for the}} ACVP to be able to show the following: The contents of the certifying examinations are relevant to the critical skills and knowledge required for successful practice of the profession. The difficulty of the examination content is appropriate for entry-level professionals entering a broad range of veterin-ary pathology positions. The examinations are of equivalent difficulty from year to year. The minimal passing score is determined fairly and objec-tively and can be justified. The ACVP certification process is compliant with current, widely accepted standards. Several task forces were established as a result of the 2007 ACVP Strategic Pla...|$|R
