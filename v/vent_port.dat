40|$|The {{subject of}} this PhD thesis is the {{development}} of an efficient system that can simultaneously pump and separate a gas-liquid mixture, in particular an oil-air mixture. Two-phase flows are encountered in many applications (petroleum extraction, flow in nuclear power plant pumps, pulp and paper processing, etc.) but this study is mainly focused on lubrication systems of aircraft gas turbine engines. The pump and separator system (PASS) for two-phase flows developed in this PhD thesis aims to perform three functions simultaneously: • Send back the oil to the tank (oil pumping) • Separate the air from the oil (de-aeration) • Separate the oil from the air (de-oiling) and release the sealing air into the atmosphere (venting). Particular care is given to the liquid flow rate lost at the gas outlet of the system. Consequently, it could replace the scavenge pumps and oil-air separators existing in present lubrication systems. This modification provides several advantages: simplification of the lubrication circuit, reduction of oil consumption and {{of the size of the}} lubrication system. This research is divided into three axes: the theoretical study of the important physical mechanisms taking place inside the two-phase flow pump and separator system, the experimental development, tests and optimization of different PASS prototypes, and also the numerical simulations of the two-phase flow inside these prototypes. Although the experiments were the central pillar of this research, the three axes were closely imbricated. The PASS design includes three main components: • An inlet chamber with one or several tangential inlets giving a natural centrifugation to the flow, • An impeller (forced centrifugation) with an axial and a radial part followed by a volute chamber, • A metallic foam that lets pass micron and sub-micron droplets and which is followed by an axial <b>vent</b> <b>port.</b> The centrifugation causes the liquid (oil) to move radially outwards in an annular body (a liquid ring) generating pressure. The thickness of this liquid ring inside the impeller is mainly determined by the pressure coefficient (related to the back-pressure and the rotational speed). When the back-pressure increases, the thickness of the liquid ring increases too. An advantage of the PASS is that it does not impose any relation between the liquid head and the liquid flow rate, contrary to common centrifugal pump. It self-regulates the radial position of the gas-liquid interface to sustain the operating conditions. The de-aeration efficiency mainly depends on the pressure coefficient (for a constant liquid viscosity or temperature) or on the thickness of the liquid ring. The pressure gradient which appears in the liquid rotating in an annular body acts like a dam for the gas phase. Indeed, the gas movement is mainly determined by the pressure field (buoyancy) while the liquid distribution is dominated by centrifugal and Coriolis forces. Buoyancy tends to accumulate the gas phase near low pressure areas (PASS hub, suction side of the blades, clearances between closed impeller and casing). The first oil-air PASS prototype produces high viscous losses due to the high peripheral velocity and liquid viscosity. Therefore, the pumping efficiency is poor compared to common impeller pumps. However, the pumping is not the key function of the PASS and a power consumption below 5 kW is acceptable for the application considered in this work. For applications that require lower power consumptions, a reduction of the rotational speed must be considered. Thus, the rotational speed and the impeller diameter are two major constraints for the PASS design which determine the de-aeration and pumping efficiencies. The impeller diameter also influences the size of passage sections for the air flow. The air velocity must be kept as low as possible because the entrainment of droplets increases when the air velocity rises (drag forces on droplets). Indeed, this large influence of the air flow rate on the oil consumption (de-oiling efficiency) was demonstrated by a theoretical analysis, the experiments and the CFD simulations. The production of droplets in the inlet pipes when the two-phase flow is annular is a key phenomenon regarding the oil consumption. In addition to the air flow rate, other variables also influence the oil consumption: • Air-oil temperature: when the temperature rises, the oil consumption increases because the surface tension and the oil density are reduced. Moreover, as the air density also decreases, the air velocity rises. • Oil flow rate: the oil consumption rises more or less linearly with the oil flow rate. However, the influence of the oil flow rate on the inlet droplet size is uncertain. • Rotational speed: the rotational speed has obviously a strong impact on the oil consumption without metallic foam. However, experiments showed that the metallic foam efficiency is almost independent on the rotational speed. Therefore, the oil consumption with the Retimet foam does not depend on the PASS rotational speed. • Altitude or air density: the oil consumption decreases when the air density is reduced because the drag forces on droplets also decrease. The gas density (altitude) is also supposed to influence the de-aeration efficiency but this could not be tested or simulated in this work (the de-aeration efficiency gets probably better when decreasing the gas density because the buoyancy forces increase). Theory, experiments and numerical simulations also allowed the prediction of performance of the first oil-air prototype for real in-flight operating conditions. Two problems have been identified: the de-aeration efficiency at MTO and cruise ratings and the oil leak throughout the vent in cold start and windmilling. To solve them, some modifications of the lubrication system have been suggested. With these modifications, the oil-air PASS should become very efficient and attractive for engine manufacturers.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to develop a computer model for the treatment of Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) of unidirectional layer stranded fabrics oriented in various directions. The individual fabric layers contain high fiber volume fraction strands, separated by channels, which the model includes as separate phases. A finite difference approximation has been developed to determine the effective permeability of the channels. This approximation is based on classical channel flow equations, and is applied to all three directions of the channels. The axial permeability in the strands has been measured. The transverse permeabilities in the strands are assumed to be equal, and are fitted to the model results. The model consists of a finite difference routine which uses cell centered grids to approximate the geometry of the reinforcement.

40|$|International audienceInjection molding {{is widely}} used to process short fibre {{reinforced}} thermoplastics. The quality and especially the mechanical properties of the resulting part {{are linked to the}} mold conception (for example the gate(s) and the <b>venting</b> <b>port(s)</b> locations) and to the processing parameters which will govern fibre orientation distribution. Fibre orientation modelling is based on the well known Folgar and Tucker equation. The models differ one from another by the interaction parameter, the closure approximation and by the coupling with the rheology of the reinforced melt. Quantitative comparison with experiments is very tedious and generally limited to simple part geometries (plaque or disk). As a consequence, in complex geometries, fibre orientation distribution is experimentally checked using several techniques and the resulting anisotropic thermo-mechanical properties are computed using various homogenization theories. In this paper, we propose a first integrated approach of the injection molding of fibre reinforced thermoplastics starting from rheology of the material, orientation equation, interaction parameter and closure approximation. The resulting local fibre orientation distribution is then used in two ways in order to predict the mechanical properties of the part: first, using classical analytical homogenization theories, but based on the computed orientation tensor and not on an experimental one, and then, using numerical homogenization which consists in generating a Representative Elementary Volume (REV), determining its unidirectional mechanical properties and finally, in computing directly the anisotropic properties of the part...|$|R

The pair also prepared all the tools {{that would be used}} during the EVA with some help from Tim Kopra. Later during the night when the crews were asleep, the team of ground controllers <b>vented</b> the <b>Port</b> 1 (P1) Ammonia Tank Assembly (ATA) Nitrogen Vent lines in preparation for the ATA to be removed during EVA 1.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} designer Robert Mainhardt {{enlisted the}} help of his friend Nick Minchakievich of Pleasanton, California, before 1962, in helping to stabilize the projectiles or ammunition. Minchakievich first developed retractable fins after rear ignition proved too dangerous. But the retractable fins proved too expensive, requiring advanced machining during production. The two experimental calibers with retractable fins were 6mm and 13mm. (Livermore Labs, p. 42.) Rushed for a solution due to the possibility of large government contracts, Minchakievich then quickly and ingeniously invented diagonal <b>vented</b> <b>ports</b> to make the projectiles or ammunition spin while advancing, thus relatively stabilize the projectiles using centrifugal force. This method was used in all the Mainhardt calibers for the Gyrojet. Minchakievich warned Mainhardt that rushing the project would only make the pistol shoddy and unreliable. Working for free out of his Livermore Aerospace Plastics Lab, Minchakievich requested six more months to perfect an accurate projectile, and make the Gyrojet more famous than the Colt Peacemaker. Mainhardt and the Air Force declined as current ordnance and technology was in demand for Vietnam. Minchakievich even attempted a marketing strategy by enlisting the help of Gene Roddenberry in using the pistol on Star Trek. Although Roddenberry loved the Gyrojet, he wanted a [...] "ray gun" [...] and not a pistol that merely shot a rocket projectile, no matter how advanced for the twentieth century. (Paramount Pictures, Correspondence, vol. XIX, p. 1309.) MBA projectiles are still found at building sites on Sycamore Creek Way and Happy Valley Road in Pleasanton where Minchakievich lived and did some experimentation. When spin stabilization was chosen for the Gyrojet, the compact electronics used in today's smart bullets were not available. [...] Both the cost and size of inertial navigation equipment have decreased greatly since a Gyrojet launcher was reviewed in Guns and Ammo Magazine in 1965.|$|R
