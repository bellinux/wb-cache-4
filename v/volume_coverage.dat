40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the patterns of}} influence between the news media and the public, by specifically targeting breaking stories, or shocks, to a news system. Specifically, we assess media agenda setting and selective exposure {{by looking at the}} relative public attention spans to hard and soft news (as measured by query volume), in comparison with the <b>volume</b> of news <b>coverage</b> (in print, broadcast, and Web content) for these selected news events. We measure the dynamic distribution of issue coverage in the news media, and how this <b>volume</b> of <b>coverage</b> ultimately influences online search traffic. In order to assess sustained interest in a given topic, distributions of query <b>volume</b> and news <b>coverage</b> were fit with Gamma distributions of appropriate parameters. Findings indicate that there are significant differences in the public attention spans for hard and soft news issues, particularly relative to what news coverage might predict. Soft news events produced a slower rate of decline in query volume, matching the slow tapering off of issue coverage found in Web content. Conversely, for hard, substantive news issues, query volume drops off quite quickly, more closely paralleling the distribution of coverage in broadcast news...|$|R
50|$|When the NEXRAD {{system was}} {{initially}} implemented, the radar automatically scanned all scan angles in a <b>Volume</b> <b>Coverage</b> Pattern, {{even if the}} highest scan angles were free of precipitation. As a result, in many cases when severe weather was further from the radar site, forecasters could not provide as timely severe weather warnings as possible. The Automated Volume Scan Evaluation and Termination (AVSET) algorithm helps solve this problem by immediately ending the volume scan when precipitation returns at higher scan angles drop below a set threshold (around 20 dBZ). This can often allow for more volume scans per hour, improving severe weather detection {{without the need for}} hardware upgrades AVSET was initially deployed in RPG build 12.3, in Fall of 2011.|$|E

The present study evaluates {{the need for}} integrating computed tomography (CT) -based planning {{in the treatment of}} carcinoma cervix. Aims: To estimate inadequacies in target <b>volume</b> <b>coverage</b> when using conventional planning based on bony landmarks. Materials and Methods: The study consisted of 50 patients. Target volume delineation was done on planning CT scans, according to the guidelines given in literature. The volume of target receiving 95 % of prescribed dose (V 95) was calculated after superimposing a conventional four field box on digitally reconstructed radiograph. The geographic miss with conventional four field box technique was compared with the CT-based target volume delineation. Results: In 48 out of 50 patients, the conventional four field box failed to encompass the target volume. The areas of miss were at the superior and lateral borders of the anterior-posterior fields, and the anterior border of the lateral fields. The median V 95 for conventional fields marked with bony landmarks was only 89. 4 % as compared to 93 % for target delineation based on CT contouring. Conclusions: Our study shows inadequate target <b>volume</b> <b>coverage</b> with conventional four field box technique.

40|$|We {{consider}} the positioning problem of aerial drone systems for efficient three-dimensional (3 -D) coverage. Our solution draws from molecular geometry, where forces among electron pairs surrounding a central atom arrange their positions. In this paper, we propose a 3 -D clustering algorithm for autonomous positioning (VBCA) of aerial drone networks based on virtual forces. These virtual forces induce interactions among drones and structure the system topology. The advantages of our approach are that (1) virtual forces enable drones to self-organize the positioning process and (2) VBCA {{can be implemented}} entirely localized. Extensive simulations show that our virtual forces clustering approach produces scalable 3 -D topologies exhibiting near-optimal <b>volume</b> <b>coverage.</b> VBCA triggers efficient topology rearrangement for an altering number of nodes, while providing network connectivity to the central drone.

40|$|Introduction: The {{prostate}} is {{the most}} prevalent tumor location of all cancer incidences of the man. The aim {{of the present study}} is to compare the conventional intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with the volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Both techniques are able to treat localized prostate cancer. Dosimetric results for specific organs at risk and conformity of treatment plans were compared. Methods: 43 VMAT patients were assigned to 43 IMRT patients with matched-pair-analyses, where all patients received a primary radiation therapy. All 86 treatment plans were created using the EclipseTM planning system to deliver a total dose of 80 Gy respectively 84 Gy to organs at risk under consideration of dose constraints. The target <b>volume</b> <b>coverage</b> and the dose sparing were measured using different conformity indices and dose-volume-histograms. Results: VMAT reduced the mean dose load to organs at risk especially for high-dose-areas. There was the best sparing on rectum (D 2 % - p = 0, 001), rectal wall (D 2 % - p = 0, 017), femoral heads (right: D 2 % - p = 0, 003; left: D 2 % - p = 0, 002) and body (Dmean - p = 0, 004). The biggest advantages of IMRT were the low-dose-areas where the bladder provided the best results (D 95 % - p = 0, 001). The target <b>volume</b> <b>coverage</b> was nearly equivalent for both techniques. Conclusion: VMAT showed a better sparing for most of the organs at risk in high-dose-areas, which is important for dose escalation in prospective treatment of prostate cancer. Regarding to the target <b>volume</b> <b>coverage</b> both techniques were accurate without showing significant differences, what presents each of them as a good treatment option for prostate cancer...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} few years several {{automatic}} and semi-automatic PET segmentation methods for target volume definition in radiotherapy have been proposed. The objective {{of this study is to}} compare different methods in terms of dosimetry. For such a comparison, a gold standard is needed. For this purpose, realistic GATE-simulated PET images were used. Three lung cases and three H&N cases were designed with various shapes, contrasts and heterogeneities. Four different segmentation approaches were compared: fixed and adaptive thresholds, a fuzzy C-mean and the fuzzy locally adaptive Bayesian method. For each of these target volumes, an IMRT treatment plan was defined. The different algorithms and resulting plans were compared in terms of segmentation errors and ground-truth <b>volume</b> <b>coverage</b> using different metrics (V(95), D(95), homogeneity index and conformity index). The major differences between the threshold-based methods and automatic methods occurred in the most heterogeneous cases. Within the two groups, the major differences occurred for low contrast cases.
