40|$|Abstract [...] Reactive power, {{measured}} in <b>volt-amperes</b> <b>reactive</b> or VARs, {{is one of}} a class of power system reliability services collectively known as ancillary services. Ancillary services are essential for the reliable operation of the bulk power system. Reactive power flows when current leads or lags behind the voltage; typically, the current lags because of inductive loads like motors. Reactive power flow wastes energy and transmission capacity, and causes voltage drop. The role of reactive power in maintaining system reliability, especially during unforeseen system contingencies, is the reason for the growing interest by regulators and system operators alike in alternative reactive power supplies. Distributed Generation is an attractive option for solving reactive power and distribution system voltage problems because of its proximity to load. Distributed Generation is very useful for the supply of MW in remote areas but since DGs are not able to produce VAR. So we have to compensate VAR through compensating devices to fulfill the demand of MW in remote areas. I...|$|R

40|$|The complex Poynting theorem (CPT) is {{extended}} to a canonical time-scale domain (t,s). Time-harmonic phasors {{are replaced by}} the positive-frequency parts of general fields, which extend analytically to complex time t+is, with s> 0 interpreted as a time resolution scale. The real part of the extended CPT gives conservation in t of a time-averaged field energy, and its imaginary part gives conservation in s of a time-averaged reactive energy. In both cases, the averaging windows are determined by a Cauchy kernel of width Δ t∼± s. This completes the time-harmonic CPT, whose imaginary part is generally supposed to be vaguely `related to' reactive energy without giving a conservation law, or even an expression, for the latter. The interpretation of s as reactive time, tracking the leads and lags associated with stored capacitative and inductive energy, gives a simple explanation of the <b>volt-ampere</b> <b>reactive</b> (var) unit measuring reactive power: a var is simply one Joule per reactive second. The related 'complex radiation impedance density' is introduced to represent the field's local reluctance to radiate.
