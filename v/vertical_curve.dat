The prestressed concrete design was relatively new for Western Australia, where road bridges had traditionally been built from timber frameworks. The bridge is arched along its length, with a <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> {{of up to}} 4% grade.|$|E
500|$|This bridge {{carries the}} A1(M) {{motorway}} over the river; it was opened by Ernest Marples, the Minister of Transport, on 31 July 1961. It {{consists of two}} separate structures, one for each carriageway, each having seven spans. The longest span, formed from two [...] cantilevers and a suspended central span of , carries the motorway over the river at a height of [...] The total length of the structure is , {{and it has a}} slight horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> at its southern end. Five riveted steel girders and a [...] composite concrete deck support each carriageway. The bridge {{was one of the first}} to use rubber bearings, and the first to use bitumen membranes lined with copper to make the decks waterproof. The design includes jacking points to compensate for mining subsidence.|$|E
500|$|Tram 142 {{was first}} used in {{schedule}} service on 1 June 1999, and 143 was delivered to Oslo on 3 June. To {{be able to use}} the trams on the desired lines, Oslo Sporveier had to upgrade its infrastructure several places. The SL95 need a <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> radius of , requiring upgrades at Wessels plass and Gamlebyen. The curves would also need to be fixed at Geita Bridge, but this was not done since the trams exceed the bridge's permitted load. The minimum permitted horizontal curve radius is , making it impossible for the trams to operate through the intersection between Riddervolds gate and Inkognitogata, where the radius is [...] This means the trams cannot operate on the Briskeby Line, and all trams to Majorstuen are therefore operated with SL79. Restrictions on two trams passing was issued on several shorter sections, including the S-curve from Kirkeristen to Stortorvet, but these sections were quickly rebuilt.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} design criterion for these curves is stopping sight distance. This is the distance a driver can {{see over the}} crest of the curve. If the driver cannot see an obstruction in the roadway, such as a stalled vehicle or an animal, the driver {{may not be able to}} stop the vehicle in time to avoid a crash. The desired stopping sight distance (S) is determined by the speed of traffic on a road. [...] By first finding the stopping sight distance (S) and then solving for the curve length (L) in each of the equations below, the correct curve length can be determined. [...] The proper equation depends on whether the <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> is shorter or longer than the available sight distance. Normally, both equations are solved, then the results are compared to the curve length.|$|E
60|$|XXVII. This rule of {{supremacy}} {{applies to}} the smallest {{as well as to}} the leading features: it is interestingly seen in the arrangement of all good mouldings. I have given one, on the opposite page, from Rouen cathedral; that of the tracery before distinguished as a type of the noblest manner of Northern Gothic (Chap. II. § XXII.). It is a tracery of three orders, of which the first is divided into a leaf moulding, fig. 4, and b in the section, and a plain roll, also seen in fig. 4, c in the section; these two divisions surround the entire window or panelling, and are carried by two-face shafts of corresponding sections. The second and third orders are plain rolls following the line of the tracery; four divisions of moulding in all: of these four, the leaf moulding is, as seen in the sections, much the largest; next to it the outer roll; then, by an exquisite alternation, the innermost roll (e), in order that it may not be lost in the recess and the intermediate (d), the smallest. Each roll has its own shaft and capital; and the two smaller, which in effect upon the eye, owing to the retirement of the innermost, are nearly equal, have smaller capitals than the two larger, lifted a little to bring them to the same level. The wall in the trefoiled lights is curved, as from e to f in the section; but in the quatrefoil it is flat, only thrown back to the full depth of the recess below so as to get a sharp shadow instead of a soft one, the mouldings falling back to it in nearly a <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> behind the roll e. This could not, however, be managed with the simpler mouldings of the smaller quatrefoil above, whose half section is given from g to g2; but the architect was evidently fretted by the heavy look of its circular foils as opposed to the light spring of the arches below: so he threw its cusps obliquely clear from the wall, as seen in fig. 2, attached to it where they meet the circle, but with their finials pushed out from the natural level (h, in the section) to that of the first order (g2) and supported by stone props behind, as seen in the profile fig. 2, which I got from the correspondent panel on the buttress face (fig. 1 being on its side), and of which the lower cusps, being broken away, show the remnant of one of their props projecting from the wall. The oblique curve thus obtained in the profile is of singular grace. Take it all in all, I have never met with a more exquisite piece of varied, yet severe, proportioned and general arrangement (though all the windows of the period are fine, and especially delightful in the subordinate proportioning of the smaller capitals to the smaller shafts). The only fault it has is the inevitable misarrangement of the central shafts; for the enlargement of the inner roll, though beautiful in the group of four divisions at the side, causes, in the triple central shaft, the very awkwardness of heavy lateral members which has just been in most instances condemned. In the windows of the choir, and in most of the period, this difficulty is avoided by making the fourth order a fillet which only follows the foliation, while the three outermost are nearly in arithmetical progression of size, and the central triple shaft has of course the largest roll in front. The moulding of the Palazzo Foscari (Plate VIII., and Plate IV. fig. 8) is, for so simple a group, the grandest in effect I have even seen: it is composed of a large roll with two subordinates.|$|E

At the same time, the depth required for foundations at this location called for minimizing {{the length of the}} approach spans. This height problem was solved by employing steep 6.5% approach grades and a fairly short 400 ft <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> {{at the center of the}} main span. In this manner, the needed height was attained and the approach viaducts were kept to a minimum length.|$|E
