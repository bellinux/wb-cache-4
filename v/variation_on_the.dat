5|$|Another <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{theme was}} {{produced}} {{later in the}} season. Like the BT46B, the BT46C removed the radiators from the front wing assembly leaving a clean aerodynamic wing and moving the centre of gravity further back again. The standard radiators were replaced by units from a Volkswagen Golf mounted behind the front wheels out of the airstream in a region of positive pressure.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Jovovich and Hawk {{designed}} the costume for Jovovich's character in Resident Evil: Extinction. The shorts Alice, her character, wears are a <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 'Alice Star' Shorts from the Spring 2007 collection. In late 2007, Jovovich-Hawk {{signed a deal}} to design a diffusion collection for Target's Go International campaign, {{following in the footsteps}} of Luella, Paul & Joe and Proenza Schouler.|$|E
5|$|The Jedi Knight {{series is}} {{composed}} primarily of first/third-person shooter gameplay elements, {{with a number}} of <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> norms of the genre within each game. All of the games use a level based system which contains a series of objectives that must be completed before the player can continue. From Dark Forces II onwards, the games have included lightsaber combat and the use of Force powers, which have been tweaked and modified as the series has progressed.|$|E

5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E
5|$|After {{his victory}} in the Spanish Civil War, Francisco Franco's plans for the Spanish Navy {{included}} the acquisition of four modern battleships, and a <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Italian s was the favored candidate to fill the requirement. In late 1939, a Spanish mission to Italy received assurances of technical support {{for the construction of}} ships of the class in Spanish yards, and a slipway of sufficient size to construct two ships at a time was built at Ferrol. However, Italy's entry into the Second World War in 1940, combined with the limited resources of Spain, led to the cancellation of the project.|$|E

5|$|Seven Halo soundtracks {{have been}} released. The Halo Original Soundtrack {{contains}} most of Combat Evolveds music. Due to the varying nature of gameplay, the music present {{was designed to}} use the game's dynamic audio playback engine. The engine allows for the mood, theme, and duration of music played to change according to gameplay. To afford a more enjoyable listening experience, O'Donnell rearranged portions of the music of Halo into standalone suites, which follow the narrative course of the game. The soundtrack also contains music not used in the game, including a <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Halo theme that was first played at Halos debut at Macworld 1999.|$|E
5|$|The Chicken Big King {{was added}} April 2014. This new <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} Big King sandwich {{was part of}} a corporate menu restructuring that began the previous year. This was part of Burger King CEO Alex Macedo's plan to introduce simpler products that require few or no new ingredients in order to simplify operations. This new sandwich uses the company's existing Crispy Chicken Jr patty in place of the beef and adds an extra layer of King sauce to ensure that the product stays moist.|$|E
5|$|While each façade of Quattro Canti is {{pleasing}} to the eye, as a scheme {{it is both}} out of proportion with the limited size of the piazza and, like most other examples of early Sicilian Baroque, can be considered provincial, naive and heavy-handed, compared with later developments. Whatever its merit, {{it is evident that}} during the 17th century, the Baroque style {{in the hands of the}} local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland Italy. This localised <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mainstream Baroque was not peculiar to Sicily, but occurred as far afield as Bavaria, and Russia, where Naryshkin Baroque would be just as eccentric as its Sicilian cousin.|$|E

5|$|Landis {{was born}} in Millville, Ohio, in 1866. His name was a {{spelling}} <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Kennesaw Mountain in the American Civil War, where his father was wounded in 1864. Landis {{spent much of his}} youth in Indiana; he left school at fifteen and worked in a series of positions in that state. His involvement in politics led to a civil service job. At age 21, Landis applied to become a lawyer—there were then no educational or examination requirements for the Indiana bar. Following a year of unprofitable practice, he went to law school. After his graduation, he opened an office in Chicago, but left it when Walter Q. Gresham, the new United States Secretary of State, named him his personal secretary in 1893. After Gresham's death in 1895, Landis refused an offer of an ambassadorship, and returned to Chicago to practice law and marry.|$|E
5|$|Maryland and Delaware plan to {{continue}} to upgrade US 113 to introduce freeway elements and access control to improve service on the U.S. Highway. MDSHA has a Phase 5 in its US 113 divided highway project {{for the construction of}} an interchange between US113 and MD12 in Snow Hill. As of 2007, the interchange was planned to be a dumbbell interchange, a <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> diamond interchange with roundabouts replacing the two intersections of the ramps with the crossroad. The work would include adding service roads to improve access among US 113, MD 12, Washington Street, and Brick Kiln Road. , Phase 5 was stalled in the design stage with no estimated completion date. The state has long-term plans to establish partial control of access on US 113 between Pocomoke City and {{the south end of the}} Snow Hill bypass. Once that project is complete, the only remaining stretch of US 113 in Maryland without access controls will be from Hayes Landing Road to the south end of the Berlin bypass.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Britain in 1821, MacGregor claimed that King George Frederic Augustus of the Mosquito Coast in the Gulf of Honduras had created him Cazique of Poyais, which he {{described}} as a developed colony with an existing community of British settlers. When the British press reported on MacGregor's deception following the return of fewer than 50 survivors in late 1823, some of his victims leaped to his defence, insisting that the general had been let down by those whom he had {{put in charge of}} the emigration party. A French court tried MacGregor and three others for fraud in 1826 after he attempted a <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scheme there, but convicted only one of his associates. Acquitted, MacGregor attempted lesser Poyais schemes in London over the next decade. In 1838, he moved to Venezuela, where he was welcomed back as a hero. He died in Caracas in 1845, aged 58, and was buried with full military honours in Caracas Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Outside of {{the hurdles}} events, the steeplechase race {{is the other}} track and field event with obstacles. Just as the {{hurdling}} events, the steeplechase finds its origin in student competition in Oxford, England. However, this event was born as a human <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> original steeplechase competition found in horse racing. A steeplechase event was held on a track for the 1879 English championships and the 1900 Summer Olympics featured men's 2500m and 4000m steeplechase races. The event was held over various distances until the 1920 Summer Olympics marked {{the rise of the}} 3000 metres steeplechase as the standard event. The IAAF set the standards of the event in 1954, and the event is held on a 400m circuit that includes a water jump on each lap. Despite the long history of men's steeplechase in track and field, the women's steeplechase only gained World Championship status in 2005, with its first Olympic appearance coming in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} reference in England to {{the legend of}} the pig-faced woman is the fable of Tannakin Skinker, a 17th-century <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> traditional loathly lady story, in particular on The Wife of Bath's Tale and The Marriage of Sir Gawain. The Skinker story is generally considered the basis for later English stories of pig-faced women. Between 4 and 11 December 1639, five ballads about Skinker were published in London, all of which are now lost. (A 1640 ballad, A Monstrous Shape: or, A Shapelesse Monster, a Description of a female creature born in Holland compleat in every part, save only a head like a swine, who hath travelled in many parts and is now to be seen in London, shees loving, courteous and effeminate and nere as yet could find a loving mate, is preserved in Samuel Pepys's extensive collection of ballads.) The earliest surviving record of the Tannakin Skinker story is that given in A Certaine Relation of the Hog-faced Gentlewoman called Mistris Tannakin Skinker, a 1640 chapbook.|$|E
