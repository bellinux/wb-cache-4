5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases {{from the surface}} through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line {{it is called the}} diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, <b>video</b> <b>cable</b> and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.|$|E
5|$|The UK {{had been}} a home for music video pioneers. When the music <b>video</b> <b>cable</b> channel MTV started {{broadcasting}} in 1982, the importance of videos abruptly grew, changing the video from an occasional promotional tool to an indispensable means of reaching an audience. MTV filled its programs with many hard rock and heavy metal videos, but these were too expensive for bands who either had no recording contract or had signed to small, independent labels. Moreover, music videos exalted the visual appeal of a band, an area where some British metal groups were deficient. So the NWOBHM suffered the same decline as other musical phenomena that were based on low-budget productions and an underground following. Many of its leaders, such as Diamond Head, Tygers of Pan Tang, Angel Witch and Samson, were unable {{to follow up on}} their initial success; their attempts to update their look and sound to match new expectations of the wider audience not only failed, but also alienated their original fans.|$|E
25|$|Analog Copy Protection (ACP), the {{encryption}} technology {{created by}} Rovi Corporation (formerly Macrovision), {{is designed to}} thwart users' attempts to reproduce content via analog cables. When a DVD is played through an analog <b>video</b> <b>cable</b> and recorded using a VCR, Rovi's ACP technology will distort the copy partially or completely.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{keyboard}} scan being {{controlled by}} the system interrupts, {{it is one of}} the troubleshooting hints when MSX machine does not display any image (given correct power is tested to be present) to press CAPS key and see if respective LED toggles. If it does not toggle, system is deemed suffering more serious problem than just lack of image on the screen (i.e. the problem with <b>video</b> <b>cable</b> or video display interface in overall).|$|E
25|$|The first American {{country music}} <b>video</b> <b>cable</b> channel was The Nashville Network, {{launched}} in the early 1980s. In 2000, after it and CMT fell under the same corporate ownership, the channel was renamed and reformatted as The National Network, a general-interest network, and eventually became Spike TV, However Spike TV {{is no longer a}} music video channel. TNN was later revived from 2012 to 2013 after Jim Owens Entertainment acquired the trademark and licensed it to Luken Communications; that channel renamed itself Heartland after Luken was embroiled in an unrelated dispute that left the company bankrupt.|$|E
25|$|Breathing gases may be {{supplied}} {{from the surface}} through a diver's umbilical, or airline hose, which provides breathing gas, communications and a safety line, with options for a hot water hose for heating, a <b>video</b> <b>cable</b> and gas reclaim line. The diver's breathing gas supply is significantly more secure than for scuba; communications are simplified and the divers position is either known or can be traced reliably by following the umbilical. Several major risks are thereby mitigated, but the system also has serious disadvantages in some applications, as diver mobility is constrained by {{the length of the}} umbilical, and it may snag on obstructions.|$|E
50|$|While {{these are}} the {{standard}} colors found on commercially made products, cables with different-colored connectors may be used, {{as long as the}} cable itself is compatible with the application (that is, <b>video</b> <b>cables</b> with 75 ohms impedance for video and SPDIF, audio cable for analog audio).|$|R

25|$|On flight day 10, astronauts Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick {{completed}} {{the third and}} final spacewalk of the STS-130 mission. Their tasks included hooking up heater and data cables for PMA-3, removing thermal covers and launch locks on Cupola, and installing handrails on Tranquility and a <b>video</b> <b>cable</b> for another base to be installed on the Russian segment of the ISS. Bob Behnken also connected the second ammonia cooling loop and disconnected a temporary power cable on Tranquility. Once the launch locks were removed, pilot Terry Virts opened the windows on Cupola for the first time. During the day Kay Hire and Terry Virts hooked up and transferred the Cupola robotics station for its use in the future. Terry Virts also completed some transfer tasks in the morning.|$|E
2500|$|The tighter {{specifications}} for <b>video</b> <b>cable</b> tends {{to produce a}} substantially constant characteristic impedance over a wide band (usually nominally 75Ω). [...] On the other hand, audio cable may be nominally 600Ω (300Ω and 150Ω are also standard values), but it will only actually measure this value at 800Hz. [...] At a lower frequencies {{it will be much}} higher and at higher frequencies will be lower and more reactive.|$|E
2500|$|Fernández and {{her husband}} have always had a tempestuous {{relationship}} with the national media, particularly the Grupo Clarín corporation, which is the owner of <b>video</b> <b>cable</b> networks, multiple TV Channels, radio stations, the main newspaper, and—through most of a decade before 2010—had a monopoly on Argentine football broadcasts: it is thus so-called opinion-former. [...] By 2010 it was obvious to independent sources that the traditionally major news media were in a direct conflict with the government, often reporting misleading Information.|$|E
5000|$|Consumer {{electronics}} {{devices such}} as digital cameras, camcorders, and portable DVD players use 3.5 mm connectors for composite video and audio output. Typically, a TRS connection is used for mono unbalanced audio plus video, and a TRRS connection for stereo unbalanced audio plus <b>video.</b> <b>Cables</b> designed for this use are often terminated with RCA connectors on the other end.|$|R

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} launch of the Wii Virtual Console service many users with {{component}} <b>video</b> <b>cables</b> experienced problems displaying some Virtual Console games due to certain TV models/manufacturers not supporting 240p over a component video connection. Nintendo's solution was to implement 'Wii Component Cable Interlace Mode' which forces the emulator to output 480i instead of 240p, however many games released prior have still not been updated.|$|R
2500|$|IC {{locations}} changed {{frequently on}} each motherboard revision, {{as did the}} presence or lack thereof of the metal RF shield around the VIC-II. PAL boards often had aluminized cardboard instead of a metal shield. The SID and VIC-II are socketed on all boards, however the other ICs may be either socketed or soldered. The first production C64s, made in 1982 to early 1983, are known as [...] "silver label" [...] models due to the case sporting a silver-colored [...] "Commodore" [...] logo. The power LED had a separate silver badge around it reading [...] "64". These machines also have only a 5-pin <b>video</b> <b>cable</b> and cannot output S-video. In late 1982, Commodore introduced the familiar [...] "rainbow badge" [...] case, but many machines produced into early 1983 also used silver label cases until the existing stock of them was used up. In the spring of 1983, the original 326298 board {{was replaced by the}} 250407 motherboard which sported an 8-pin video connector and added S-video support for the first time. This case design would be used until the C64C appeared in 1987. All ICs switched to using plastic shells while the silver label C64s had some ceramic ICs, notably the VIC-II. The case is made from ABS plastic which may become brown with time. This can be reversed by using the public domain chemical mix [...] "Retr0bright".|$|E

The company was founded by an audiophile and engineer, Noel Lee, in 1979 by experimenting with different ways to build audio cables. It grew by doing demonstrations to convince the industry that audio cables made a difference in audio quality and by establishing relationships with retailers that were attracted to the cable's profit margins.|$|R
