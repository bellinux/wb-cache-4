Twenty-one top-class young soccer players (16. 1 ± 0. 2 years) performed a countermovement jump test and a maximal instep soccer kick test before and after running for 20 min on a treadmill at 80 % of their individual maximum heart rate. Two force platforms were used to obtain the following parameters during the countermovement jump: jump height, maximum power, maximum power relative to body mass, maximum <b>vertical</b> ground <b>reaction</b> force, maximum <b>vertical</b> ground <b>reaction</b> force relative to body mass, and maximum <b>vertical</b> ground <b>reaction</b> force applied to each leg. Maximum <b>vertical</b> ground <b>reaction</b> force and maximum <b>vertical</b> ground <b>reaction</b> force relative to body mass applied to the support leg during the kicks were also calculated with a force platform.

Non-significant differences were found in the parameters measured during the countermovement jump and the maximal instep soccer kick test before and after running, suggesting that the jumping and kicking performances of top-class young soccer players were not significantly affected after 20 min treadmill running at 80 % of their individual maximum heart rate...|$|R

40|$|Parameters {{associated}} {{with the performance of}} countermovement jumps were identified from <b>vertical</b> ground <b>reaction</b> force recordings during fatigue and resting conditions. Fourteen variables were defined, dividing the <b>vertical</b> ground <b>reaction</b> force into negative and positive external working times and times in which the <b>vertical</b> ground <b>reaction</b> force values were lower and higher than the participant's body weight. We attempted to explain parameter variations by considering the relationship between the set of contractile and elastic components of the lower limbs. We determined that jumping performance is based on impulsion optimization and not on instantaneous ground reaction force value: the time in which the ground reaction force was lower than the body weight, and negative external work time was lower under fatigue. The results suggest that, during fatigue, there is less contribution from elastic energy and from overall active state. However, the participation of contractile elements could partially compensate for the worsening of jumping performance...|$|R

40|$|Background Knee {{osteoarthritis}} {{is common}} in people who have undergone partial meniscectomy, and a higher external knee flexion moment during gait may be a potential contributor. Although the peak external knee flexion moment {{has been shown to}} increase from 3 months to 2 years following partial meniscectomy, mechanisms underpinning the increase in the peak knee flexion moment are unknown. Methods Sixty-six participants with partial meniscectomy completed three-dimensional gait (normal and fast pace) and quadriceps strength assessment at baseline (3 months following partial meniscectomy) and again 2 years later. Variables included external knee flexion moment, <b>vertical</b> ground <b>reaction</b> force, knee flexion kinematics, and quadriceps peak torque. Findings For normal pace walking, the main significant predictors of change in peak knee flexion moment were an increase in peak <b>vertical</b> ground <b>reaction</b> force (R 2 = 0. 55), mostly due to an increase in walking speed, and increase in peak knee flexion angle (R 2 = 0. 19). For fast pace walking, the main significant predictors of change in peak knee flexion moment were an in increase in peak <b>vertical</b> ground <b>reaction</b> force (R 2 = 0. 51) and increase in knee flexion angle at initial contact (R 2 = 0. 17). Change in peak vertical force was mostly due to an increase in walking speed. Interpretation Findings suggest that increases in <b>vertical</b> ground <b>reaction</b> force and peak knee flexion angle during stance are predominant contributors to the 2 -year change in peak knee flexion moment.

40|$|The aim of {{this pilot}} study was to compare the <b>vertical</b> <b>reaction</b> forces (N) {{generated}} in three different Action 3 manual one-arm drive wheelchairs: dual handrim, a lever drive and a Neater Uni-wheelchair (NUW). A CONFORmat® Pressure measurement mat, placed {{on top of the}} users' prescribed cushion, measured vertical force at the buttock/seat interface on both hemiplegic and non-hemiplegic sides in each wheelchair. Methods: Fifteen hemiplegic users were randomly assigned each wheelchair to drive around an indoor obstacle course. During propulsion of a multiple sensor, continuous measurement of force was recorded. Time taken to complete the circuit was recorded. Mean force and confidence intervals for each buttock were calculated per user per wheelchair. Results: The dual handrim produced the highest vertical force during propulsion under the right buttock ([Formula: see text] = 484. 43; SD = 55. 4; p < 0. 001) and the lever drive produced the least force ([Formula: see text] = 368. 05; SD = 53. 55; p < 0. 01).
