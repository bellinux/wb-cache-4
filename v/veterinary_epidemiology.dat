40|$|Integrating {{the control}} of {{multiple}} neglected zoonoses at the community-level holds great potential, but critical data is missing to inform the design and implementation of different interventions. In this paper we present an evaluation of an integrated health messaging intervention, using powerpoint presentations, for five bacterial (brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis) and dog-associated (rabies, cystic echinococcosis and leishmaniasis) zoonotic diseases in Sidi Kacem Province, northwest Morocco. Conducted by <b>veterinary</b> and <b>epidemiology</b> students between 2013 and 2014, this followed a process-based approach that encouraged sequential adaptation of images, key messages, and delivery strategies using auto-evaluation and end-user feedback. We describe the challenges and opportunities of this approach, reflecting on who was targeted, how education was conducted, and what tools and approaches were used. Our results showed that: (1) replacing words with local pictures and using "hands-on" activities improved receptivity; (2) information "overload" easily occurred when disease transmission pathways did not overlap; (3) access and receptivity at schools was greater than at the community-level; and (4) piggy-backing on high-priority diseases like rabies offered an important avenue to increase knowledge of other zoonoses. We conclude by discussing the merits of incorporating our validated education approach into the school curriculum in order to influence long-term behaviour change...|$|R

40|$|Q fever is a {{zoonosis}} occurring {{worldwide in}} livestock. Often neglected in differential diagnoses, Q fever can persist in herds causing financial {{losses in the}} long run. In ruminants, well-known manifestations of Q fever are abortion, stillbirth, delivery of weak offspring and premature delivery. In cattle, Q fever is frequently asymptomatic and/or under-reported. The use of new methodologies in <b>veterinary</b> clinical <b>epidemiology</b> is of prime importance to find accurate clinical indicators of exposure to C. burnetii at herd level. A retrospective randomly cross-sectional survey was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of Q fever in southern Belgium {{by means of an}} ELISA test performed on the bulk tank milk (n =  206 cattle herds). At the same time, a questionnaire was accomplished allowing the investigation of presumptive clinical signs observed at herd level during the previous twelve months for dairy cows. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify abortion and irregular repeat breeding as two indicators associated with Q fever exposure in dairy herds. In addition, a bootstrapped quantile regression revealed that the average score of putative clinical signs related to Q fever was significantly more important in exposed versus non-exposed herds. A classification and regression tree (CART) analysis confirmed the importance of the average clinical score and the irregular repeat breeding as main splitters, considering or not each clinical sign separately. Considering herd clinical patterns, instead of taking each clinical sign separately, seems to be more useful to differentiate herds at risk of Q fever exposure...|$|R

40|$|In spatial epidemiology, disease {{incidence}} and demographic data are commonly summarized within larger regions such as administrative units because of privacy concerns. As a consequence, analyses using these aggregated data {{are subject to}} the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) as the geographical manifestation of ecological fallacy. In this study, we create small area disease estimates through dasymetric refinement, and investigate the effects on predictive epidemiological models. We perform a binary dasymetric refinement of municipality-aggregated dog tumor incidence counts in Switzerland for the year 2008 using residential land as a limiting ancillary variable. This refinement is expected {{to improve the quality of}} spatial data originally aggregated within arbitrary administrative units by deconstructing them into discontinuous subregions that better reflect the underlying population distribution. To shed light on effects of this refinement, we compare a predictive statistical model that uses unrefined administrative units with one that uses dasymetrically refined spatial units. Model diagnostics and spatial distributions of model residuals are assessed to evaluate the model performances in different regions. In particular, we explore changes in the spatial autocorrelation of the model residuals due to spatial refinement of the enumeration units in a selected mountainous region, where the rugged topography induces great shifts of the analytical units i. e., residential land. Such spatial data quality refinement results in a more realistic estimation of the population distribution within administrative units, and thus, in a more accurate modeling of dog tumor incidence patterns. Our results emphasize the benefits of implementing a dasymetric modeling framework in <b>veterinary</b> spatial <b>epidemiology...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{veterinary}} {{world is}} shocked and deeply {{saddened by the}} untimely death of Cristiana Patta, manager at Sardinia’s Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale. Cristiana was a nationally and internationally acclaimed virologist, distinguished throughout her intense but all-too-brief life by her talent and professionalism. After studying microbiology and virology at the University of Sassari, specialising in microbiological and virological techniques, she began {{her career as a}} researcher in the viral animal diseases sector at the Istituto di Sassari. Her work included the main aspects of exotic animal diseases, from diagnosis to control, as well as the planning and management of eradication programmes for the principal infectious diseases (swine fever, brucellosis, tuberculosis and bluetongue) under European Union surveillance. Her knowledge of swine fever – and particularly African swine fever – led her to become a national and international expert in the control of this disease. In this role, she {{became a member of the}} roster of experts of the Ministry of Health and the European Commission. She contributed to numerous European research projects and was an invited speaker at many scientific assemblies sponsored by international organisations such as the OIE, FAO and EU.

40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} is {{an important}} human and animal pathogen that causes a number of diseases that vary in their etiology and severity. Differences between strains regarding toxin gene composition and toxin production partly explain why some strains cause radically different diseases than others. However, they do not provide a complete explanation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if there is a phylogenetic component that explains the variance in C. perfringens strain virulence by assessing patterns of genetic polymorphism in genes (colA gyrA, plc, pfoS, and rplL) that form part of the core genome in 248 type A strains. We found that purifying selection plays a central role in shaping the patterns of nucleotide substitution and polymorphism in both housekeeping and virulence genes. In contrast, recombination was found to be a significant factor only for the virulence genes plc and colA and the housekeeping gene gyrA. Finally, we found that the strains grouped into five distinct evolutionary lineages that show evidence of host adaptation and the early stages of speciation. The discovery of these previously unknown lineages and their association with distinct disease presentations carries important implications for human and <b>veterinary</b> clostridial disease <b>epidemiology</b> and provides important insights into the pathways through which virulence has evolved in C. perfringens...|$|R
40|$|The {{ecology of}} {{wildlife}} diseases is a multidisplinary {{field of study}} that interfaces host and pathogen ecology, <b>epidemiology,</b> <b>veterinary</b> science and mathematical and statistical modelling. This area of research acknowledges the complex role of diseases in shaping ecosystem dynamics: on the one side, pathogens and parasites are a fundamental, and sometime overlooked driver of species evolution and ecological adaptations of populations. On the other hand, changes in abundance and distribution of host and reservoir populations affects the persistence, occurrence and emergence of diseases. The recent emergence or upsurge of viral infections, also of zoonotic interest, {{has been linked to}} climatic and landuse changes that have rapidly altered the balance between hosts, vectors and pathogens; in parallel, the sudden local or regional decrease of population abundance of certain wildlife species, to the point of pushing them to the risk of local extinction, have been put in relation to a variety of factors, such as habitat loss, parasite-mediated apparent competition, and upsurge of diseases. In this talk, I will present some study cases from the empirical essays and mathematical modelling our research group have undertaken for the last > 10 yrs in the Alpine environment, which is undergoing an unprecedentedly rapid change under the current climate and global change threat...|$|R
