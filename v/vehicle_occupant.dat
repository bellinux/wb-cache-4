The fine in Montana for not wearing a seat belt in 2015 was $20. Although speed limits increased from 75mph to 80mph on rural interstates that year, the biggest statewide increase in both crashes and deaths occurred on secondary roads. Forty-three people died on Montana two-lane roads outside of towns that are neither U.S. or state highways.|$|E

5000|$|Over time, various {{manufacturers}} have used different terms for airbags. In the 1970s, General Motors marketed its first airbag modules under the unwieldy name [...] "Air Cushion Restraint System (ACRS)". Common terms in North America {{refer to a}} nominal role {{as a supplement to}} [...] "active" [...] restraints, i.e. seat belts. Because no action by a <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant</b> is required to activate or use the airbag, it is considered a [...] "passive" [...] device. This is in contrast to seat belts, which are considered [...] "active" [...] devices because the <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant</b> must act to enable them.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupants</b> are warmed or cooled {{indirectly}} via heating, ventilation and {{air conditioning}} (HVAC) systems. The need to enhance electric vehicle range has fuelled interest in developing alternative, more energy efficient modes or adjuncts to HVAC systems to achieve thermal comfort. Infrared (IR) radiant heat, that falls directly on the individual, could be a more effective and energy efficient adjunct to traditional air heating methods. Therefore this investigation examined the impact of applying an IR heat source on <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupants</b> achieving thermal comfort...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{analyze the}} crash and injury data in {{forensic}} medicine {{for years of}} 2004 - 2007. MethodsA sample of over 567 accident cases (9 pedestrians, 116 bicyclists, and 442 motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupants)</b> was considered from the Department of Forensic Medicine, Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, involving drivers {{of all ages and}} covering a four-year period. ResultsThe male fatality rates were significantly higher than female ones. The groups at 15 - 30 years old and at 30 - 55 years old had the first and second highest numbers of deaths (40 % and 34 %, respectively). There were substantial differences in distribution of injuries in motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupants</b> and pedestrians and bicyclists. Among motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupants,</b> there were more head injuries, such as skull fracture, brain contusion, subdural haemorrhage, and epidural haemorrhage. Nearly 77 % of fatalities occurred during 08 : 0 0 - 22 : 00 in Sirjan. Internal bleeding was also higher in motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupants.</b> Pedestrians and bicyclists also had head injuries frequently. ConclusionsIn spite of reduction of road traffic fatalities in Sirjan in 2007, it {{is still one of the}} cities with high road traffic fatality in the world. These results underline the importance of preventive strategies in transportation, suggesting that different methods are necessary to reduce fatalities of various traffic participants...|$|R

50|$|The second impact (also {{known as}} second {{collision}} and human collision) {{is the impact}} suffered between a <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant</b> and the vehicle {{he or she is}} riding in during some kind of safety incident.

50|$|Seatbelts that {{automatically}} {{move into position}} around a <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant</b> once the adjacent door is closed and/or the engine is started were developed as a countermeasure against low usage rates of manual seat belts, particularly in the United States.

One large observation studying using US data showed that the odds ratio of crash death is 0.46 with a three-point belt, when compared with no belt.

5000|$|Every year {{approximately}} 10,000 Americans {{are killed}} in rollover accidents, accounting for about 30% of all light <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant</b> fatalities. [...] The number of occupant injuries is significantly higher. The relationship between injury levels and intrusion or roof crush has been statistically established, but the mechanism has been thought sometimes {{to be somewhat}} obscure. Theories advocating the idea that rollover injuries are caused by the occupants [...] "falling" [...] or [...] "diving" [...] into the vehicles interior have been advanced, but the severity of these events, and thus their potential for causing injury, has been questioned.|$|E
50|$|The W116 {{models were}} large luxury sedans. The W116 was larger {{on the outside}} than the W108/W109 series it replaced, but had similar {{interior}} capacity, as the additional bulk was driven by several new and aforementioned engineering developments on car safety and occupant protection in a crash. The W116 introduced other improved passive safety features into the vehicle design, including a strengthened <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant</b> shell. It {{was one of the}} first cars to be available with ABS, a driver's airbag supplemental restraint system (but not available at the vehicle's initial launch). Also, the W116 was the first mass production passenger vehicle offered with a turbocharged diesel engine.|$|E
5000|$|Best-practices {{in modern}} road safety {{strategy}}: [...] The basic strategy of a Safe System {{approach is to}} ensure that {{in the event of a}} crash, the impact energies remain below the threshold likely to produce either death or serious injury. This threshold will vary from crash scenario to crash scenario, depending upon the level of protection offered to the road users involved. For example, the chances of survival for an unprotected pedestrian hit by a vehicle diminish rapidly at speeds greater than 30 km/h, whereas for a properly restrained motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant</b> the critical impact speed is 50 km/h (for side impact crashes) and 70 km/h (for head-on crashes).

50|$|A vehicle-sensitive lock {{is based}} on a {{pendulum}} swung away from its plumb position by rapid deceleration or rollover of the vehicle. In the absence of rapid deceleration or rollover, the reel is unlocked and the belt strap may be pulled from the reel against the spring tension of the reel. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant</b> can move around with relative freedom while the spring tension of the reel keeps the belt taut against the occupant. When the pendulum swings away from its normal plumb position due to sudden deceleration or rollover, a pawl is engaged, the reel locks and the strap restrains the belted occupant in position. Dual-sensing locking retractors use both vehicle G-loading and webbing payout rate to initiate the locking mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Advanced airbag {{technologies}} {{are being developed}} to tailor airbag deployment to {{the severity of the}} crash, the size and posture of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant,</b> belt usage, and how close that person is to the actual airbag. Many of these systems use multi-stage inflators that deploy less forcefully in stages in moderate crashes than in very severe crashes. Occupant sensing devices let the airbag control unit know if someone is occupying a seat adjacent to an airbag, the mass/weight of the person, whether a seat belt or child restraint is being used, and whether the person is forward in the seat and close to the airbag. Based on this information and crash severity information, the airbag is deployed at either at a high force level, a less forceful level, or not at all.|$|E
5000|$|Automatic belt systems {{also present}} several {{operational}} disadvantages. Motorists who would normally wear seat belts must still fasten the manual lap belt, thus rendering redundant the automation {{of the shoulder}} belt. Those who do not fasten the lap belt wind up inadequately protected only by the shoulder belt; in a crash without a lap belt such a <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupant</b> is likely to [...] "submarine" [...] (be thrown forward under the shoulder belt) and be seriously injured. Motorized or door-affixed shoulder belts hinder access to the vehicle, {{making it difficult to}} enter and exit—particularly if the occupant is carrying items such as a box or a purse. Vehicle owners tend to disconnect the motorized or door-affixed shoulder belt to relieve the nuisance of entering and exiting the vehicle, leaving only a lap belt for crash protection. Also, many automatic seat belt systems are incompatible with child safety seats, or only compatible with special modifications.|$|E
50|$|A crime trend {{known as}} “arrastões” (dragnets) occur when many {{perpetrators}} act together, simultaneously mug pedestrians, sunbathers, shopping mall patrons, and/or <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupants</b> stuck in traffic.
