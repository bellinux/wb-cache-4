50|$|The {{authorities}} demand {{much control}} over {{the performance of the}} theatre troupe, and try to use it for propaganda purposes. The film crew plays along, but among themselves and in the <b>voice-over</b> <b>they</b> are critical of the regime.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990 an {{animated}} TV series {{was made by}} Atelier5, broadcast on Vtm. Each episode was based on original Suske en Wiske stories, with Han Peekel as narrating <b>voice-over.</b> <b>They</b> were also made available on video.|$|E
50|$|The three {{survivors}} {{drive off}} into the sunrise, with Edward in a <b>voice-over</b> stating that <b>they</b> have a cure and can change others back.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} {{crew of the}} film spent a year recording interviews with over a hundred {{people of all ages}} and backgrounds. These recordings are edited to make a blueprint for the film. From this, they created a quasi-fictional narrative that the real (non-actor) person acts out while hearing (in <b>voice-over)</b> how <b>they</b> see and experience the world.|$|R
5000|$|The next (eighth) segment {{focuses on}} the Japanese navy achievements. A large {{submarine}} is shown [...] "three weeks ahead of schedule", according to the <b>voice-over.</b> Indeed, <b>they</b> are still working on it while it moves under water. After this, a group of Japanese submarine sailors are shown using [...] "intricate and technical machinery", which are actually pinball machines, slot machines and a peep show machine.|$|R
5000|$|The {{adaptation}} starts {{by describing}} a divided Scotland which is populated by Highlanders and Lowlanders who are loyal to different kings. Allan Breck Stuart is characterised {{as a leading}} figure of Jacobitism who tried [...] "to keep the flame alive". It ends when Alan Breck Stuart leaves Scotland forever [...] "to have a distinguished career in the French Army", while David Balfour stays and marries a lady from the Highlands. Another <b>voice-over</b> tells <b>they</b> had sons who [...] "were neither Highlanders nor Lowlanders. They were Scots." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Philip (Mark Lester) is {{a troubled}} 10-year-old boy {{who has been}} fleeing the {{confines}} of his family's home since babyhood. Like some wild animal, Philip refuses to be penned up. Even more frustrating for his devoted mother and more irritable father, Philip has refused to speak {{since the age of}} three. Run Wild, Run Free (1969), directed by Richard C. Sarafian, is occasionally graced with experimental, art film touches, as when, at one point the internal thoughts of Philip's mother (Sylvia Syms) describing her fatigue and inability to love her son can be heard as <b>voice-over</b> as <b>they</b> drive to a therapist appointment.|$|R
500|$|The {{scripting}} of the film, tentatively titled as Running {{with the}} Bulls, {{was completed in}} November 2009 {{after three months of}} work. Zoya and Kagti incorporated real life observations, and specially wrote the character of Imraan for her brother Farhan Akhtar. Akhtar wrote the dialogues for the film. The theme of the film was [...] "about three guys on the verge of making commitments in life", according to him. They used Javed Akhtar's poetry as a <b>voice-over</b> because <b>they</b> felt the poetry adds depth to the character and lends voice to their feelings. A special poem inspired by a fan's poem was penned down for Katrina's character, after she was cast in the project. The first choice for the location of principal filming was Mexico, but was later changed to Spain since the climax features running with the bulls and Zoya wanted a country that blended history, culture and sports. The release date of the film was rescheduled thrice because the originally selected editor, Chandan Arora, fell ill and they had to redo the editing.|$|R
50|$|Malick's second {{film was}} the Paramount-produced Days of Heaven, about a love {{triangle}} that develops {{in the farm}} country of the Texas Panhandle in the early 20th century. Production began {{in the fall of}} 1976 in Alberta, Canada. The film was mostly shot during the magic hour, with primarily natural light. Much like Malick's first feature, Days of Heaven had a lengthy and troubled production, with several members of the production crew quitting before shooting was finished, mainly due to disagreements over Malick's idiosyncratic directorial style. The film likewise had a troubled post-production phase, as Billy Weber and Malick spent two years editing, during which they experimented with unconventional editing and <b>voice-over</b> techniques once <b>they</b> realized the picture they had set out to make would not fully work.|$|R
