500|$|Section 2(5) of the Act {{provides}} {{that there is}} no liability for [...] "risks willingly accepted as his by the visitor", an application of <b>volenti</b> non fit injuria. An occupier can also restrict or exclude liability via a notice providing warnings and conditions of entry, although under section 65 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA) this cannot exclude liability for death or personal injury due to negligence where the premises are occupied for the business purposes of the occupier. Before CRA it was treated differently; in Ashdown v Samuel Williams & Sons Ltd [...] 1 QB 409 the Court of Appeal held that an occupier could exclude liability by displaying a notice disclaiming as such, even if the claimant had not read the notice. This provision of the Act has been heavily criticised by commentators.|$|E
500|$|A {{commonly}} used defence for the torts of trespass against {{the person is}} that of <b>volenti</b> non fit injuria, or consent. If a claimant participates in a sporting activity in which physical contact is ordinary conduct, such as rugby, they are considered to have consented. This {{is not the case}} if the physical contact went beyond what could be expected, as in R v Billinghurst, or where the injuries were suffered not from the claimant's participation in the sport but inadequate safety measures taken, as in Watson v British Boxing Board of Control. The same general rule applies to people who voluntarily take part in fights, although only if the injuries caused are proportionate, as in Lane v Holloway. If the claimant is informed by a doctor of the broad risks of a medical procedure, there will be no claim under trespass against the person for resulting harm caused; the claimant's agreement constitutes [...] "real consent", as in Chatterton v Gerson. Consent for medical procedures is different in cases where the claimant does not have the mental capacity to consent. In F v West Berkshire Health Authority, it was held that in such situations the requirements are that there [...] "must be a necessity to act when it is not practical to communicate with the assisted person ... the action taken must be such as a reasonable person would in all the circumstances take, acting {{in the best interests of}} the assisted person".|$|E

2500|$|The trespasser's {{acceptance}} of a risk, known as the defence of <b>volenti</b> non fit injuria, is covered in Section 1(6) of the Act, which provides that [...] "no duty is owed ... to any person in respect of risks willingly accepted as his by that person". In Ratcliffe v McConnell [...] the plaintiff, who had been drinking (but was not drunk) jumped into a swimming pool marked with warning signs, suffering serious injuries after hitting the bottom. The Court of Appeal held that, because of the circumstances (jumping into an obviously shallow pool with warning signs during the winter), the plaintiff should have known of the risk and, by acting, had accepted the risk. The Law Commission had initially recommended that the Act contain provisions {{making it clear that}} a trespasser's awareness or {{acceptance of}} a warning sign was not conclusive evidence of acceptance of the risk, but this was not included.|$|E
2500|$|Philippide entered Junimea {{society in}} the early 1890s, during its gradual {{relocation}} to Bucharest, the national capital. He then remained {{in contact with the}} young intellectuals who still met in Iași, where Junimea maintained a nominal presence—with N. <b>Volenti</b> and Teohari Antonescu as mainstays. Philippide was disgusted by the provincial airs of Iași Junimism. In December 1898, he wrote a letter to Junimea founder Titu Maiorescu, telling him that his creation had [...] "degenerated" [...] beyond recognition: [...] "joke has turned to buffoonery, sally to insanity, liberty to anarchy." [...] His time at Junimea did not leave a significant impact on his thinking: it was for him primarily a means of access to high society and developing useful connections with prominent figures capable of helping him advance. Later, once he was secure in his professorship, he distanced himself from Junimism, particularly its political manifestation.|$|E
2500|$|Encouraged by his mentor, he {{completed}} his theoretical preparation at the universities of Berlin, Leipzig and Paris. He became {{an associate professor}} in 1894, aged 22, in the history of modern philosophy and logic department of the University of Iași. Both Negulescu and Teohari Antonescu, the archaeologist, were moved there in a bid to ensure Junimea control over the university, and to consolidate the conservative circles of Iași, against a rising tide of socialist influence. Although he found the city [...] "repulsive" [...] and a [...] "place of exile", Negulescu accepted his appointment as a political and cultural mission. He was soon disappointed by the local Junimea branch and its president, N. <b>Volenti,</b> asking Maiorescu to send them better cultural material. In these early years, Negulescu was heavily indebted to Maiorescu's influence, down to oratory: he was known (and ridiculed) for copying Maiorescu's speech mannerisms. Also like Maiorescu, he was an atheist and a positivist, who read religion in functionalist terms.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Volenti</b> non fit injuria is Latin for [...] "to the willing, no {{injury is}} done". It {{operates}} when the claimant either expressly or implicitly consents {{to the risk}} of loss or damage. For example, if a regular spectator at an ice hockey match is injured when a player strikes the puck in the ordinary course of play, causing it to fly out of the rink and hit him or her, this is a foreseeable event and regular spectators are assumed to accept that risk of injury when buying a ticket. A slightly more limited defence may arise where the defendant has been given a warning, whether expressly to the plaintiff/claimant or by a public notice, sign or otherwise, that there is a danger of injury. The extent to which defendants can rely on notices to exclude or limit liability varies from country to country. This is an issue of policy as to whether defendants should not only warn of a known danger, but also take active steps to fence the site and take other reasonable precautions to prevent the known danger from befalling those foreseen to be at risk.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{important}} protection for people's health {{has been the}} National Health Service, founded by the NHS Act 1946. The National Health Service Act 2006 entitles everyone to {{health care in the}} UK, and is funded through the tax system. If people are injured at work, they may be treated regardless of their means to pay. There is also the right, under the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to statutory sick pay. People at work can also sue for compensatory damages whenever they are injured and employers have breached a statutory duty. They can claim for the injury itself, loss of income, and relatives or dependents may recover small sums to reflect distress. Employers are vicariously liable for all agents acting for them in the [...] "course of employment" [...] whenever their actions have a [...] "close connection" [...] to the job, and even if it breaks an employer's rules. An employer only has a defence if an employee, on a [...] "frolic of his own", was not placed by an employer in a position to cause harm. Under the Employers’ Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969, employers must take out insurance for all injury costs. Insurance companies may not their employee to recover costs unless there is fraud. However, until the mid-20th century there were a series of major limitations. First, until 1937, if an employee was injured by a co-worker, the doctrine of common employment, the employer could only be liable if it was shown they were personally liable by carelessness in selecting staff. The House of Lords changed this in Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd v English, holding an employer had a non-delegable duty of care for all employees. Lord Wright held there were [...] "fundamental obligations of a contract of employment... for which employers are absolutely responsible". The second old restriction was that, until 1891, <b>volenti</b> non fit injuria meant workers were assumed to voluntarily accept the dangers of their work by agreeing to their contracts of employment. Only if an employee callously ignores clear directions of the employer will he be taken to have voluntarily assumed the risk, like in ICI Ltd v Shatwell where an experience quarry shotfirer said he [...] "could not be bothered" [...] to wait 10 minutes before setting of a detonation, and blew up his brother. Third, even if a worker was slightly at fault, until 1945 such contributory negligence precluded the whole of the claim. Now the court will only reduce damages by the amount the employee contributed to their own injury. The fourth defence available to employers, which still exists, is ex turpi causa non oritur actio, that if the employee was engaged in any illegal activity they may not claim compensation for injuries. In Hewison v Meridian Shipping Services Pte Ltd Mr Hewison concealed his epilepsy so that he could work offshore was technically guilty of illegally attempting to gain a pecuniary advantage by deception under the Theft Act 1968 section 16. After being struck in the head by a defective gangplank he suffered worse fits than before, but the Court of Appeal, by a majority, held his illegal act precluded any compensation.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the modern}} scheme of {{legislation}} and regulation engenders {{a comprehensive approach}} to enforcement and worker participation for health and safety matters, the common law remains relevant for getting civil law compensation, and some limits on an employers' duties. Although the legislative provisions are not automatic, breach of a statutory duty is evidence that a civil law duty has been breached. Injured employees can generally claim for loss of income, and relatives or dependents recover small sums to reflect distress. In principle, employers are vicariously liable for all actions of people acting {{for them in the}} [...] "course of employment" [...] whenever their actions have a [...] "close connection" [...] to the job, and even if it breaks an employer's rules.

"I {{would hardly}} have {{proposed}} this measure," [...] said, or rather mumbled, Father Aldrovand, {{who had recently}} lost four of his front teeth by a stone from a sling,--"yet, being so generously offered by the party principally concerned, I hold with the learned scholiast, <b>Volenti</b> non fit injuria." ...|$|E

For an individual to demand the freedom of the independent single Church when he receives £500 a year for submitting to the necessary restrictions of the Church General, is impudence and Mammonolatry to boot.|$|E
60|$|It {{has been}} shown, I hope with {{sufficient}} evidence, that a constitution against {{the interest of}} the many is rather of the nature of a grievance than of a law; that of all grievances it is the most weighty and important; that it is made without due authority, against all the acknowledged principles of jurisprudence, against the opinions of all the great lights in that science; and that such is the tacit sense even of those who act in the most contrary manner. These points are, indeed, so evident, that I apprehend the abettors of the penal system will ground their defence on an admission, and not on a denial of them. They will lay it down as a principle, that the Protestant religion is a thing beneficial for the whole community, as well in its civil interests as in those of a superior order. From thence they will argue, that, the end being essentially beneficial, the means become instrumentally so; that these penalties and incapacities are not final causes of the law, but only a discipline to bring over a deluded people to their real interest, and therefore, though they may be harsh in their operation, they will be pleasant in their effects; and be they what they will, they cannot be considered as a very extraordinary hardship, {{as it is in the}} power of the sufferer to free himself when he pleases, and that only by converting to a better religion, which it is his duty to embrace, even though it were attended with all those penalties from whence in reality it delivers him: if he suffers, it is his own fault; <b>volenti</b> non fit injuria.|$|E
60|$|For instance, {{there are}} some who say, that it is unjust to punish any one for the sake of example to others; that {{punishment}} is just, only when intended {{for the good of the}} sufferer himself. Others maintain the extreme reverse, contending that to punish persons who have attained years of discretion, for their own benefit, is despotism and injustice, since if the matter at issue is solely their own good, no one has a right to control their own judgment of it; but that they may justly be punished to prevent evil to others, this being an exercise of the legitimate right of self-defence. Mr. Owen, again, affirms that it is unjust to punish at all; for the criminal did not make his own character; his education, and the circumstances which surround him, have made him a criminal, and for these he is not responsible. All these opinions are extremely plausible; and so long as the question is argued as one of justice simply, without going down to the principles which lie under justice and are the source of its authority, I am unable to see how any of these reasoners can be refuted. For, in truth, every one of the three builds upon rules of justice confessedly true. The first appeals to the acknowledged injustice of singling out an individual, and making him a sacrifice, without his consent, for other people's benefit. The second relies on the acknowledged justice of self-defence, and the admitted injustice of forcing one person to conform to another's notions of what constitutes his good. The Owenite invokes the admitted principle, that it is unjust to punish any one for what he cannot help. Each is triumphant so long as he is not compelled to take into consideration any other maxims of justice than the one he has selected; but as soon as their several maxims are brought face to face, each disputant seems to have exactly as much to say for himself as the others. No one of them can carry out his own notion of justice without trampling upon another equally binding. These are difficulties; they have always been felt to be such; and many devices have been invented to turn rather than to overcome them. As a refuge from the last of the three, men imagined what they called the freedom of the will; fancying that they could not justify punishing a man whose will is in a thoroughly hateful state, unless it be supposed to have come into that state through no influence of anterior circumstances. To escape from the other difficulties, a favourite contrivance has been the fiction of a contract, whereby at some unknown period all the members of society engaged to obey the laws, and consented to be punished for any disobedience to them; thereby giving to their legislators the right, which it is assumed they would not otherwise have had, of punishing them, either for their own good or for that of society. This happy thought was considered to get rid of the whole difficulty, and to legitimate the infliction of punishment, in virtue of another received maxim of justice, <b>volenti</b> non fit injuria; that is not unjust which is done with the consent of the person who is supposed to be hurt by it. I need hardly remark, that even if the consent were not a mere fiction, this maxim is not superior in authority to the others which it is brought in to supersede. It is, on the contrary, an instructive specimen of the loose and irregular manner in which supposed principles of justice grow up. This particular one evidently came into use as a help to the coarse exigencies of courts of law, which are sometimes obliged to be content with very uncertain presumptions, on account of the greater evils which would often arise from any attempt on their part to cut finer. But even courts of law are not able to adhere consistently to the maxim, for they allow voluntary engagements to be set aside on the ground of fraud, and sometimes on that of mere mistake or misinformation.|$|E
