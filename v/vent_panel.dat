40|$|In this work, {{a series}} of vented explosions in a typical {{compressor}} compartment are simulated using FLACS code to analyze the explosion venting characteristics. The effects of relevant parameters on the pressure peaks (i. e., overpressure and negative pressure) are also numerically investigated, including vent area ratio of the compressor compartment, vent activation pressure, mass per unit area of <b>vent</b> <b>panels,</b> and volume blockage ratio of obstacles. In addition, the orthogonal experiment design and improved grey relational analysis are implemented to evaluate the impact degree of these relevant parameters. The {{results show that the}} pressure peaks decrease with the increase of vent area ratio. There is an approximately linearly increasing relationship between the pressure peaks and the vent activation pressure. The pressure peaks increase with the mass per unit area of <b>vent</b> <b>panels.</b> The pressure peaks increase with the volume blockage ratio of obstacles. Based on the grey relational grade values, the effects of these relevant parameters on the overpressure peak are ranked as follows: volume blockage ratio of obstacles > vent activation pressure > vent area ratio > mass per unit area of <b>vent</b> <b>panels.</b> These achievements provide effective guidance for the venting safety design of gas compressor compartments...|$|R

40|$|Venting {{systems are}} useful for the {{mitigation}} of ac- cidental explosions. Vent ducts should be used if equipment is located indoors, as NFPA 68 (2007) suggests, for discharging combustion products to safe location. However, {{the presence of a}} duct is likely to increase the severity of the explosion with respect to simply vented vessels. Up to now, no reliable correlations are available for the sizing of ducted vented systems. The only cor- relation available was developed by Bartknecht in 1993 for gas explosion, also acknowledged by NFPA 68. In this study, we propose an engineering correla- tion based on semi-empirical engineering methodolo- gies, which is able to quantify the relations between geometric properties and the peak pressure occurring in the combustion chamber {{in the presence of a}} duct fitted on the <b>vent</b> <b>panel.</b> To this aim, we have regressed all the available experimental data on gas explosion in ducted-vented vessels...|$|E
40|$|Venting {{devices are}} the main {{solution}} for the mitigation of accidental explosion. However, relief ducts are mandatory for the discharge of combustion products to safe location. On the other hand, {{the presence of a}} duct is likely to increase the severity of the explosion with respect to simply vented vessels. To this regard, several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the enhanced violence of the explosion in such configuration: secondary explosion in the duct (burnup), frictional drag and inertia of the gas column in the duct, acoustic and Helmholtz oscillations. The relative effects of the cited phenomena and their weight on maximum pressure reached during ducted vented explosion is uncertain. As a consequence, appropriate design of ductventing configuration is still a matter of debate and it’s not surprising that the available guidelines for the design of ducted vents for gas explosions can lead to gross errors. The authors have recently proposed experimental and numerical analyses (Computational Fluid Dynamics) for the analysis of duct-vented phenomena on the peak pressure measured in either small, medium or large scale equipment. Results of these studies highlighted that the two main phenomena responsible for the increased peak pressure are: i) the explosion occurring in the initial sections of the duct leading to a backflow from the duct towards the main vessel, thus restricting the effective vent section; ii) the turbulization of flame within the combustion chamber, due to the backflow, which enhances the combustion rate and the rate of pressure rise. In this paper, we propose an engineering correlation based on semi-empirical engineering methodologies aiming at quantifying the relation between the geometric properties (venting section, duct length, vessel volume) and the peak pressure occurring in the combustion chamber {{in the presence of a}} duct fitted on the <b>vent</b> <b>panel...</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose - Maintaining air {{circulation}} between the wearer and garment layer {{is crucial for}} activating heat and moisture transfer from the body. If an air gap is trapped, {{air circulation}} may become ineffective and the ventilation of the garment is, thus, hindered. To maintain and extend the air gap, this study aims to propose a design method that involves placing spacer blocks underneath the garment to prevent the fabric from clinging directly to the skin. Design/methodology/approach - To study the application of this design method, a series of T-shirts were produced and tested using a thermal manikin in standing and walking postures. All the T-shirts were made of fabric ostensibly manufactured to have high air permeability. Porous mesh fabric was used to construct the <b>vented</b> <b>panels</b> on the T-shirts. The test was conducted in a chamber with controlled temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity. Total thermal insulation (R-t) and moisture vapour resistance (R-et) were measured. Findings - The test results showed that extension of the air gap between wearer and fabric provided higher ventilation to the wearer if the <b>vented</b> <b>panels</b> were also present on the T-shirts. Different placements of the <b>vented</b> <b>panels</b> on the T-shirts also affected the heat and moisture transfer from the thermal manikin. Research limitations/implications - Due to limited resources, the evaluation of total thermal insulation and moisture vapour resistance {{was based on the}} testing result from a thermal manikin instead of any subjective wearer trial. Practical implications - This research can contribute to the clothing designer who is developing function wear for a better ventilation. Social implications - This research can contribute to the clothing designer who is developing function wear for a better ventilation. Originality/value - This study aimed to further develop a new design concept in T-shirt design by improving the construction of the spacer blocks. Fabric with higher air and water vapour permeability was used to determine to what extent this design method is applicable to higher performance on heat and moisture transfer.

40|$|Abstract. -Research was {{conducted}} in Hawaii during 1984 - 1 987 to investigate the possibility that escape vents fitted in traps used by the commercial lobster fishery in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands would reduce the catch and mortality of sublegal spiny lobsters Panulim margrnatus (< 50 mm tail width) and slipper lobsters Scyllurides spp. (< 56 mm tail width) without significantly reducing legal catch. A circular vent was more efficient than the traditional rectangular vent in maximizing escapement of sublegal lobsters and retention of legal ones for both species. Optimum results were attained with two <b>vented</b> <b>panels</b> each containing four 67 -mm-diameter circular vents. Traps equipped with the circular vents caught 83 % fewer sublegal spiny lobsters and 93 % fewer sublegal slipper lobsters than nonvented control traps, {{and they did not}} significantly reduce legal catch of either species. In contrast, traps with two 49 -mm-high x 285 -mm-wide rectangular vents reduced the catch of sublegal spiny and slipper lobsters by 70 and 93 %, respectively, but also reduced legal slipper lobster retention by a significant 32 % of the control catch. As a result of this research, all traps used in the lobster fishery in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands after 1 January 1988 must be equipped with two panels with 67 -mm circular vents.

40|$|Hydrogen gas {{produced}} from the {{renewable energy source}} can be the prefect future energy carrier. It will not only reduce the demands for depleting hydrocarbons fuels but will also help in reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. The 20 -ft ISO standard containers are widely considered for building self-contained portable fuel cell based power generation units. Safety analysis of these installations is essential to prevent any future catastrophic accidents. The present paper evaluates existing engineering models to predict vented explosion peak overpressures {{in case of an}} accident release of hydrogen in these container. Such predictions are required in the design of <b>venting</b> <b>panels,</b> which are commonly used to prevent damage to enclosures by reducing overpressure of combusting gases. Although various engineering models and empirical correlations have been developed, a number of which have been included in engineering standards and guidelines [4 - 7]. These correlations, however, often have conflicting recommendations [3]. None of the engineering models in the public domain have been validated with vented hydrogen tests data in realistic configurations, such as ISO shipping containers, used in hydrogen energy applications. Evaluating/improving these engineering models with the aid of full scale experimental data and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based numerical modelling is a main objective of the HySEA project supported by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking (FCH 2 JU) under the Horizon 2020 Framework Program for Research and Innovation. The present study aims to assess capabilities of existing engineering models for vented deflagrations of lean hydrogen-air mixtures. As hydrogen has much higher flame speeds than hydrocarbon fuels like methane and propane, {{it is not possible to}} use models derived for hydrocarbons directly with hydrogen flames. The leaner flames of hydrogen are also susceptible to instabilities like Darius-Landau instability, Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which are often overlooked in the derivation of engineering models...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} natural {{ventilation}} of garments {{is often a}} crucial task in designing functional garments. Normally, the ventilation can be improved by using appropriate types of fabric, or applying functional design details such <b>vented</b> <b>panels</b> on certain parts of a garment. Apart from these two means, {{are there any other}} alternative ways that clothing designers can utilize? Designing is a means to solve problems. Through a patent search, it was found that some inventors have adopted different means of designing to improve natural ventilation. Putting mesh panels on the garments was the most common way to achieve such aim. This design method had been proven by scholarly researches on its contribution on heat and moisture transfer. In addition, some designers noted that the air gap between the garment and body could be a key to affect such natural ventilation. For example, Moretti proposed putting additional spacer objects under the shoulder areas to create a gap so as to improve the natural ventilation of the wearer. Although this new design was claimed to have contribution to enhance natural ventilation for the wearer, the testing results were not provided. In this study, T-shirt designed with larger air gaps on the shoulders was developed. In order to test the effectiveness of this design method on heat and moisture transfer, a series of testing were conducted by using a movable thermal manikin in a chamber with the control of temperature and relative humidity. In order to test the functionality of the chimney/pumping/ventilation effect, the testing was conducted under no wind and windy conditions with a thermal manikin in a standing position, and under a simulated “walking” motion (walking speed of 1. 24 km/h). The test results showed that the T-shirt with a larger air gap on the shoulders can significantly improve moisture vapor resistance during windy conditions. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
