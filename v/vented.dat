The <b>vent</b> lines are sewed to the <b>vent</b> band in an order such that the end of a first <b>vent</b> line is sewed to the <b>vent</b> band at a starting point with the end of a second <b>vent</b> band then being sewed to the <b>vent</b> band adjacent to and counterclockwise from the first band. A third <b>vent</b> band is sewed to the <b>vent</b> band adjacent to and clockwise from the first band, with a fourth <b>vent</b> band being sewed to the <b>vent</b> band adjacent to and counterclockwise from the second <b>vent</b> band. It can be seen that, if the <b>vent</b> lines are numbered in the order of being sewed to the <b>vent</b> band, the odd numbered <b>vent</b> lines will run consecutively in a clockwise direction and the even numbered lines will run consecutively in a counterclockwise direction from the starting point.

Though recycled in modern systems, xenon <b>vented</b> to the atmosphere is only returning to its original source, without environmental impact.|$|E
5|$|After {{performing}} {{in a number}} of heavy metal bands in high school, Townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and was asked to perform lead vocals on Steve Vai's album Sex & Religion. After recording and touring with Vai, Townsend was discouraged by what he found in the music industry, and <b>vented</b> his anger on the solo album Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band under the name, and released the critically acclaimed City in 1997. Since then, he has released three more studio albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records.|$|E

40|$|Discharge rate of a {{horizontal}} adjacent smoke <b>vent</b> under sprinkler spray is experimentally investigated. Temperature of smoke layer and velocity of smoke <b>venting</b> were measured, under different sprinkler operating pressures and smoke <b>venting</b> areas. CO concentration at the smoke <b>vent</b> center and velocity of <b>vent</b> flow with fresh air outside {{were recorded in}} tests under different smoke <b>venting</b> conditions. Experimental results have shown that efficiency of smoke <b>venting</b> is controlled {{by a combination of}} smoke buoyancy and drag force of sprinkler spray. Only when buoyancy is greater than drag force the smoke could be extracted by <b>venting.</b> Velocity of smoke <b>venting</b> has shown to decrease as the operating pressure increases. Smoke <b>venting</b> logging, which represents the failure of smoke <b>venting,</b> was experimentally found from certain operating pressure called initial logging pressure. The CO concentration was found to increase after sprinkler was operated as the smoke is constrained in the spray region with horizontal momentum decreased. Negative pressure difference is caused at the <b>vent</b> when there is smoke <b>venting</b> logging, which might practically bring the exterior fresh air into the fire building. Additionally, experiments results have shown that the <b>venting</b> area has little influence on smoke flow under smoke <b>venting</b> logging...|$|R
40|$|In deep-sea {{hydrothermal}} <b>vent</b> fields, faunal {{distribution is}} associated with the geochemical environments generated by hydrothermal <b>vent</b> activity. Hydrothermal <b>vent</b> fields on the Central Indian Ridge (CIR) are associated with <b>vent</b> fauna which is thought as a mixture of Atlantic and Pacific and are discretely distributed along the ridge axis of more than 1, 000 km apart. In this chapter, faunal distribution in hydrothermal <b>vent</b> fields on the CIR is summarized at the intra- and inter-field levels. The species composition of the <b>vent</b> fauna in the four <b>vent</b> fields hitherto known is reviewed and updated, and faunal resemblance among the four <b>vent</b> fields of the CIR appears to reflect the number of species recorded, indicating that faunal surveys are not sufficient in describing the whole <b>vent</b> fauna on the CIR. All the genetic studies of the CIR <b>vent</b> fauna have indicated a high genetic connectivity among the local populations, despite the many potential dispersal barriers existing between the <b>vent</b> fields. On the basis of the spatial distribution of <b>vent</b> species in a <b>vent</b> field, typical <b>vent</b> fields on the CIR were classified into six zones, of which the central two zones are often covered by Rimicaris swarms in the Kairei and Edmond fields. The close relationship between <b>vent</b> fauna from the CIR and the western Pacific, compared to those from other regions, is highlighted. Knowledge of the Indian Ocean <b>vent</b> fauna is limited, and further quantitative information on the biodiversity of <b>vent</b> fauna will provide clues to the formation of biogeographical regions and the dispersal of <b>vent</b> fauna among deep-sea hydrothermal <b>vent</b> fields. 8 page(s...|$|R
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution in Europe, {{demand for}} {{alkaline}} substances increased. A new industrial process developed by Nicolas Leblanc of Issoundun, France enabled cheap large-scale production of sodium carbonate (soda ash).

Until the British Alkali Act 1863 and similar legislation in other countries, the excess HCl was <b>vented</b> into the air. After {{the passage of the}} act, soda ash producers were obliged to absorb the waste gas in water, producing hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale.|$|E

Images acquired from this distance had very poor spatial resolution, but revealed a highly reflective surface devoid of impact craters, indicating a youthful surface. Voyager 1 also confirmed that Enceladus was embedded in the densest part of Saturn's diffuse E ring. Combined with the apparent youthful appearance of the surface, Voyager scientists suggested that the E ring consisted of particles <b>vented</b> from Enceladus's surface.|$|E
5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} {{the most common cause of}} COPD, with factors such as air {{pollution}} and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly <b>vented</b> heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs, resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests. In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve much with the use of a bronchodilator.|$|E

Data {{for the analysis of}} the Titan forward skirt compartment <b>venting</b> during ascent through the atmosphere are provided. Full scale simulated flight hardware, such as the honeycomb <b>vent,</b> duct corrugations and field joint ring were used. Boundary layer thicknesses were used to vary boundary height. The highest <b>vent</b> discharge coefficient for any given Mach number and <b>vent</b> pressure ratio generally occurred at the maximum displacement thickness. With no <b>vent</b> flow the static pressure in the <b>vent</b> region was generally less than the free stream static pressure.

5|$|Although {{adapted to}} {{terrestrial}} life, frogs resemble freshwater fish in {{their inability to}} conserve body water effectively. When they are on land, much water is lost by evaporation from the skin. The excretory system {{is similar to that}} of mammals and there are two kidneys that remove nitrogenous products from the blood. Frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic products from the kidney tubules. The nitrogen is excreted as ammonia by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as urea, a less toxic product, by most terrestrial adults. A few species of tree frog with little access to water excrete the even less toxic uric acid. The urine passes along paired ureters to the urinary bladder from which it is <b>vented</b> periodically into the cloaca. All bodily wastes exit the body through the cloaca which terminates in a cloacal vent.|$|E
5|$|In Akagi predecessor, Hōshō, the hot {{exhaust gases}} <b>vented</b> by {{swivelling}} funnels posed {{a danger to}} the ship, and wind-tunnel testing had not suggested any solutions. Akagi and Kaga were given different solutions to evaluate in real-world conditions. Akagi was given two funnels on the starboard side. The larger, forward funnel was angled 30° below horizontal with its mouth facing the sea, and the smaller one exhausted vertically a little past the edge of the flight deck. The forward funnel was fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by hot exhaust gases and a cover that could be raised to allow the exhaust gases to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea. Kaga adopted a version of this configuration when she was modernized during the mid-1930s.|$|E

40|$|In <b>vent</b> design guides {{there is}} no {{reference}} {{to the shape of}} the <b>vent,</b> only to its geometrical area. This work was carried out on the commonly used circular and square <b>vent</b> shapes for the same geometrical area, in order to investigate whether <b>vent</b> shape was a significant parameter in <b>vent</b> design. The work was carried out in a 0. 01 m 3 cylindrical explosion vessel with an L/D of 2. 8 with end wall ignition opposite the <b>vent,</b> which is close to the limit of applicability of US and European <b>vent</b> design guides for compact vessels.

The impact of the <b>vent</b> shape was mainly on the external explosion and was significant at low Kv =V 2 / 3 /Av, with a reduced overpressure for square <b>vents</b> of about 30 %. The effect of the <b>vent</b> shape was greater for ethylene/air and occurred at all Kv tested from 3. 6 to 10. 9. There were two contributory factors to the effect, the change in the discharge coefficient of the <b>vent</b> with <b>vent</b> shape and the greater entrainment of external air into square jets, which caused the jet to spread faster and have lower flame speeds and lower external overpressures...|$|R

5|$|In WSC's debut {{season of}} 1977–78, Chappell hit the first Supertest century and {{finished}} fifth in overall averages. The prevalence of short-pitched fast bowling {{and a serious}} injury to Australian David Hookes led to the innovation of batting helmets; Chappell {{was one of the}} many batsmen to use one. Following their 1975–76 tour of Australia, the West Indies adopted a four-man fast bowling attack, while the World XI contained fast bowlers of the calibre of Imran Khan, Mike Procter, Garth Le Roux, Clive Rice and Sarfraz Nawaz. The constant diet of pace bowling undermined the confidence of some batsmen during WSC. Chappell's form fell away during the second season and he scored only 181 runs at 25.85 in four Supertests. During the last six days of the season, the WSC Australians lost the finals of both the limited-overs competition (to the West Indies XI) and the Supertest series (to the World XI), thus forfeiting the winner-takes-all prize money. After the latter match, Chappell <b>vented</b> his frustrations on World XI captain Tony Greig by refusing to shake his hand and criticising Greig's inconsequential contribution to his team's victory. The final act of the competition was a series between the WSC Australians and the WSC West Indies played in the Caribbean in the spring of 1979. After the Australians suffered a heavy defeat in the first Supertest at Jamaica, Chappell rallied his team to draw the five match series one-all. His best effort were scores of 61 and 86 at Barbados.|$|E
