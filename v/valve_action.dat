25|$|The {{triple valve}} is {{described}} as being so named as it performs three functions: Charging air into an air tank ready to be used, applying the brakes, and releasing them. In so doing, it supports certain other actions (i.e. it 'holds' or maintains the application and it permits the exhaust of brake cylinder pressure and the recharging of the reservoir during the release). In his patent application, Westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it: the diaphragm-operated poppet valve feeding reservoir air to the brake cylinder, the reservoir charging valve, and the brake cylinder release valve. When he soon improved the device by removing the poppet <b>valve</b> <b>action,</b> these three components became the piston valve, the slide valve, and the graduating valve.|$|E

50|$|The Lambert {{automobile}} chassis {{with the}} gearless friction drive speed change transmission {{was the basis}} for the Lambert automobiles and trucks built from 1906 through 1916. The <b>valve</b> <b>action</b> of the engines were hardened steel cams that were applied to the cam shaft. The cam faces were slightly convex, and worked on hardened rollers, carried in swinging forks, which bore against square ended sliders. The valves were alumimum heads driven to shoulder on riveted steel stems. The <b>valve</b> <b>action</b> was direct with no side action on the sliders.

50|$|With {{some early}} steam hammers an {{operator}} moved the valves by hand, controlling each blow. With others the <b>valve</b> <b>action</b> was automatic, allowing for rapid repetitive hammering. Automatic hammers could give an elastic blow, where steam cushioned the piston {{towards the end}} of the down stroke, or a dead blow with no cushioning. The elastic blow gave a quicker rate of hammering, but less force than the dead blow.Machines were built that could run in either mode according to the job requirement.The force of the blow could be controlled by varying the amount of steam introduced to cushion the blow.A modern air/steam hammer can deliver up to 300 blows per minute.|$|E

5000|$|The 1955-up Pontiac V8 was an {{overhead}} valve engine with wedge combustion chambers. It used cast iron cylinder heads and a cast-iron block. An innovative design feature was mounting the rocker arms on ball pivots on studs set into the cylinder-head, rather than using a separate rocker shaft; this allowed more consistent <b>valve</b> <b>action</b> with less weight than a conventional shaft. It was also cheaper to build than a rocker shaft; this Pontiac-patented technology was immediately handed to the Chevrolet division for their first postwar V-8, which appeared the same year. This handing over Pontiac's valve train invention ( [...] Engineer Clayton leach [...] ) violated GM's rule for a division having a one model year exclusivity, but alas Ed Cole at Chevrolet got his way.

50|$|The {{principle}} {{is illustrated in}} the diagram. When reservoir G is lowered, bulb B and tube T are filled with gas from the enclosure being evacuated (through tube A). When G is raised, mercury rises in tube F and cuts off the gas in B and T at C. This gas is then forced through the mercury in tube D into the atmosphere. The end of tube D is bent upward at E to facilitate collection of gas (or vapor). By alternately raising G, a pumping action results. Clearly tubes F and D must be long enough to support mercury columns corresponding to atmospheric pressure (76 cm at sea level). Instead of using mercury to provide a <b>valving</b> <b>action</b> at C, {{it is possible to}} use a glass float valve.|$|R
40|$|A {{parametric}} {{model for}} the voice source is described which includes the acoustic interaction between the glottal source and the subglottal and supraglottal acoustic systems. The acoustic theory of speech production, as first proposed, and as generally now implemented in formant-based speech synthesis, models the speech production mechanism during vocalic sounds with three relatively independent subsystems. These subsystems, shown diagrammatically in Fig. I-A- 1, are (1) the respiratory system, which produces a slowly varying tracheal air pressure, (2) a time-varying glottal flow resistance (more properly, a complex impedance) whose <b>valving</b> <b>action</b> creates quasi-periodic air pulses, and (3) a supraglottal vocal tract that shapes the spectrum of the glottal flow pulses. Though each of these systems interacts {{with the other two}} systems to some degree, order-of-magnitude calculations, model studies and early measurements have indicated that for many applications it is sufficient to consider these three subsystems as operating independently, at least during voiced sounds with no strong supraglottal ora...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} seen that, in the agriculture, wastage of water and valve {{controlling}} {{is one of the}} major concern. At present it is operated manually which leads to great man power requirement. Also adequate and required supply of water is needed in agriculture.

Depending on this status, valve controlling action is performed. After the adequate supply of water, valves are closed automatically depending on the updated status of the sensors.

The rotating piston contains regenerators ported to the walls of the piston. The piston fits closely in the cylinder {{at each end of the}} cylinder except in areas where the wall of the cylinder is relieved to provide passages between the cylinder wall and the piston leading to the expansion and compression spaces, respectively. The piston reciprocates as it rotates. The cylinder and piston together comprise an integral valve that seqentially opens and closes the ports at the ends of the regenerators alternately allowing them to communicate with the expansion space and compression space and blocking that communication. The relieved passages in the cylinder and the ports in the piston are so arranged that each regenerator is sequentially (1) charged with compressed working gas from the compression space; (2) isolated from both expansion and compression spaces; (3) discharged of working gas into the expansion space; and (4) simultaneously charged with working gas from the expansion space while being discharged of working gas into the compression space, in the manner of the Sibling Cycle.

40|$|Manual small {{incision}} cataract surgery {{has evolved}} into a popular method of cataract surgery in India. However, in supra hard cataract, bringing out the whole nucleus through the sclerocorneal flap valve incision becomes difficult. A bigger incision required in such cataracts loses its value action, as the internal incision and corneal valve slips beyond the limbus into sclera. Struggling with the supra hard cataracts through a regular small incision. Phacofracture in the anterior chamber becomes a useful option in these cases. In the snare technique, a stainless steel wire loop when lassoed around the nucleus in the anterior chamber constricts from the equator, easily dividing the hardest of the nuclei into two halves. The wire loop constricts in a controlled way when the second cannula of snare is pulled. The divided halves can easily be brought out by serrated crocodile forceps. This nuclear management can be safely performed through a smaller sclerocorneal flap valve incision where the corneal <b>valve</b> <b>action</b> is retained within the limbus without sutures, and the endothelium or the incision is not disturbed.
