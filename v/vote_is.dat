5|$|Wałęsa's {{contention}} for the 2000 {{presidential election}} {{ended with a}} crushing defeat when he polled 1.01 percent of the vote. His humiliation was increased because Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who was re-elected {{in the first round}} with 54 percent of the <b>vote,</b> <b>is</b> a former Communist apparatchik. Wałęsa polled in seventh place, after which he announced his withdrawal from Polish politics.|$|E
50|$|Swailes's {{surplus of}} 89 <b>votes</b> <b>was</b> not transferred, {{as it was}} too low to change the {{relevant}} candidate order. Juba's surplus of 57 <b>votes</b> <b>was</b> also not transferred, for the same reason. Murphy was eliminated, and her 1,991 <b>votes</b> <b>were</b> distributed as follows: St. John 1309, Scott 205, Stubbs 163. 314 <b>votes</b> <b>were</b> non-transferable.

5|$|Aborigines were {{represented}} by eight members out of 225 {{seats in the}} Legislative Yuan. In 2008, the number of legislative seats was cut in half to 113, of which Taiwanese aborigines are represented by six members, three each for lowland and highland peoples. The tendency of Taiwanese aborigines to vote {{for members of the}} pan-blue coalition has been cited as having the potential to change the balance of the legislature. Citing these six seats in addition with five seats from smaller counties that also tend to vote pan-blue has been seen as giving the pan-blue coalition 11 seats before the first <b>vote</b> <b>is</b> counted.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Government's unequivocal {{view that}} the right to <b>vote</b> <b>is</b> an implied {{constitutional}} right, in Singapore it is the courts that ultimately determine the meaning of the Constitution. Thio Li-ann has suggested that since the right's status {{is not likely to be}} brought before the courts in a dispute, the Cabinet should refer the matter to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution for an authoritative opinion.|$|E
5|$|Government {{meetings}} are public; however, {{the government may}} decide to close any part of its sessions (or entire sessions) to the public. The prime minister may authorise any deputy to represent the PM and otherwise take over any particular task assigned to the PM. The quorum for government sessions is a majority of government members. Most decisions are reached by a simple majority vote; a two-thirds majority <b>vote</b> <b>is</b> required for decisions about changes to the Croatian Constitution, uniting with other states or transferring any part of Croatian sovereignty to supranational organisations, changes to Croatian borders, dissolution of the parliament, or calling a referendum.|$|E

Each director's <b>vote</b> <b>is</b> weighted {{in accordance with the}} total share capital of the member nations that director represents.

The agency's Executive Vice President directs its overall strategy and manages its daily operations. , Keiko Honda serves as Executive Vice President of MIGA.|$|E
5|$|Once all votes {{have been}} cast, the first Scrutineer chosen shakes the container, {{and the last}} Scrutineer removes and counts the ballots. If the number of ballots does not {{correspond}} {{to the number of}} cardinal electors present (including sick cardinals in their rooms), the ballots are burnt, unread, and the <b>vote</b> <b>is</b> repeated. If, however, no irregularities are observed, the ballots may be opened and the votes counted. Each ballot is unfolded by the first Scrutineer; all three Scrutineers separately write down the name indicated on the ballot. The last of the Scrutineers reads the name aloud.|$|E
5|$|Speaking in Parliament on 12 February 2009, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann {{posed the}} {{question}} of whether the right to <b>vote</b> <b>is</b> a constitutional one and suggested that the Law Minister obtain an advisory opinion to clarify the point. This issue was briefly dealt with by the Minister who simply answered it in the affirmative, rendering the need for a resolution by the constitutional tribunal nugatory. Thio subsequently expressed the view that it would be desirable to ask the Constitutional Tribunal to give its authoritative opinion as the courts are the final arbiter on questions of constitutionality in Singapore.|$|E
50|$|A {{postal voting}} and proxy <b>voting</b> <b>are</b> also {{possible}}. Postal <b>voting</b> <b>is</b> possible both in country and abroad, but proxy <b>voting</b> <b>is</b> possible only in Poland.

To avoid a stalemate, Jack casts his vote for Elizabeth, making her King.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian {{constitution}} and legislation provides for regular {{elections for the}} office of the President of the Republic, parliamentary, county prefects, county assemblies, city and municipal mayors and city and municipal councils. The President of the Republic is elected to a five-year term by a direct vote of all citizens of Croatia. A majority <b>vote</b> <b>is</b> required to win. A runoff election round is held in cases where no candidate secures the majority {{in the first round of}} voting. The presidential elections are regulated by the {{constitution and}} dedicated legislation; the latter defines technical details, appeals and similar issues.|$|E
5|$|The Singapore {{position}} may {{be compared}} with the situation in other jurisdictions. In Malaysia, the right to <b>vote</b> <b>is</b> entrenched in Article 119 of the Federal Constitution, but suffrage is similarly denied to those serving prison terms. In Yazid bin Sufaat v. Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia (2009), it was held that while detainees under the Internal Security Act 1960– who have not been convicted of any crime– still enjoy the right to vote in national elections, that right may only be exercised only in the constituencies they are registered in, and does not extend to allowing them to vote while incarcerated elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|The {{members of}} the Presidential Council are not elected, but {{appointed}} by the President on advice of the Cabinet. No public nomination process or <b>vote</b> <b>is</b> stipulated in the Constitution. The President, {{if he does not}} concur with the Cabinet, may veto the appointment. However, he is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers ("CPA"), a constitutional body that advises the President on appointments of key public officials and matters relating to Singapore's financial reserves. If he exercises his veto without the CPA's concurrence, Parliament may overrule his decision with a resolution passed with a two-thirds majority vote. The President has no power to remove current members.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} balloting, the fifty {{states of the}} U.S. are split into six regions (Far West, Mid Atlantic, Mid West, North East, South, South West), and six {{regional}} representatives are selected to appoint voters in their states. Each region has 145 media votes, {{for a total of}} 870 votes. In addition, all previous Heisman winners may vote, and one final <b>vote</b> <b>is</b> counted through public balloting. The Heisman ballots contain a 3-2-1 point system, in which each ballot ranks the voter's top three players and awards them three points for a first-place vote, two points for a second-place vote, and one point for a third-place vote. The points are tabulated, and the player with the highest total of points across all ballots wins the Heisman Trophy.|$|E
5|$|Meltzer {{began the}} Hall of Fame by {{choosing}} {{a list of}} 122 inaugural inductees in 1996. Since then, wrestlers from past and present, others employed in the professional wrestling industry, and wrestling journalists and historians have been selected by Meltzer to cast secret ballots to determine annual groups of inductees. Voting criteria include {{the length of time}} spent in wrestling, historical significance, ability to attract viewers, and wrestling ability. Inductees must have at least 15 years of experience in the wrestling business or be over 35 years old and have 10 years of experience. To gain membership in the hall, potential inductees must receive 60% support on the ballots from their geographic region. Any person that gets less than 10% of the <b>vote</b> <b>is</b> eliminated from the ballot. If a person fails to get inducted 15 years after being put on the ballot, they must get 50% of the vote or be eliminated. There are 211 inductees, including the seven tag teams.|$|E
