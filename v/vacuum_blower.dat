40|$|The duct of a {{robot vacuum}} cleaner is {{the length of the}} flow channel between the inlet of the rolling brush blower and the outlet of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>blower.</b> To cope with the {{pressure}} drop problem of the duct flow field in a {{robot vacuum cleaner}}, a method based on Pressure Implicit with Splitting of Operators (PRISO) algorithm is introduced and the optimisation design of the duct flow field is implemented. Firstly, the duct structure in a robot vacuum cleaner is taken as a research object, with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) theories adopted; a three&# 8208;dimensional fluid model of the duct is established by means of the FLUENT solver of the CFD software. Secondly, with the k&# 8208;&# 949; turbulence model of three&# 8208; dimensional incompressible fluid considered and the PRISO pressure modification algorithm employed, the flow field numerical simulations inside the duct of the robot vacuum cleaner are carried out. Then, the velocity vector plots on the arbitrary plane of the duct flow field are obtained. Finally, an investigation of the dynamic characteristics of the duct flow field is done and defects of the original duct flow field are analysed, the optimisation of the original flow field has then been conducted. Experimental results show that the duct flow field after optimisation can effectively reduce pressure drop, the feasibility as well as the correctness of the theoretical modelling and optimisation approaches are validated...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} the results and lesson learned from several two-phase extraction tests and system operations data from the last three years. The paper provides an outline for the proprietary and non-proprietary two-phase extraction methods, designing and implementing effective pilot tests, performance monitoring, and design considerations for volatile hydrocarbons stripping and minimizing the friction losses. Two-phase extraction is an effective method for the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated with volatile hydrocarbons. Two-phase extraction removes both groundwater and soil vapor in a common stream while enhancing biodegradation of the hydrocarbons in the vadose and the saturated zone. The method should be used after serious consideration for the water lifting mechanism of the vacuum, and the friction losses due to handling large volume of water. In most applications, a conventional <b>vacuum</b> <b>blower</b> system with a carefully designed knockout and piping system can perform {{as well as a}} liquid ring pump system. The success of two-phase extraction depends on the ability of the piping design to deliver maximum vacuum to the wellhead with minimal friction loss in the extraction pipe. One major challenge is to lift the water in the well from depths greater than 33 feet. There are several proprietary and non-proprietary methods available presenting their own challenges and benefits. Another major challenge is to measure the vapor flow at the individual wellhead when extracting from more than one well. A flow splitter was developed to overcome the difficulty of measuring flow of water and vapor separately. Two-phase extraction strips volatile compounds from the groundwater with stripping efficiency up to 99 % for BTEX and/or MTBE observed during two full-scale system operations and over seven pilot tests...|$|E
50|$|The soil vapor {{extraction}} remediation technology uses <b>vacuum</b> <b>blowers</b> and extraction wells {{to induce}} gas {{flow through the}} subsurface, collecting contaminated soil vapor, which is subsequently treated aboveground. SVE systems can rely on gas inflow through natural routes or specific wells may be installed for gas inflow (forced or natural). The vacuum extraction of soil gas induces gas flow across a site, increasing the mass transfer driving force from aqueous (soil moisture), non-aqueous (pure phase), and solid (soil) phase into the gas phase. Air flow across a site is thus a key aspect, but soil moisture and subsurface heterogeneity (i.e., a mixture of low and high permeability materials) can result in less gas flow across some zones. In some situations, such as enhancement of monitored natural attenuation, a passive SVE system that relies on barometric pumping may be employed.|$|R

40|$|The DO {{experimental}} area has a generator designated as emergency power. This generator provides power for critical loads and starts automatically upon loss of commercial power. This note concerns {{the testing of}} this generator. A list of loads is attached to this note. One of the loads on the emergency power grid is a 10 KVA Uninterruptable Power Supply(UPS). The UPS powers the cryogenic controls and Oxygen deficiency hazard equipment(ODH) and has a minimum rating of 20 minutes while on its batteries(to cover the transfer time to/from the emergency generator). Jan 23, 1991 at 1640 hrs this system was tested {{under the supervision of}} the Terry Ross, Marv Johnson, Dan Markley, Kelly Dixon, and John Urbin. The power feeder to the emergency power grid at DO was disconnected. The generator responded immediately and was supplying power to the emergency power grid in less than 10 seconds. During the 10 seconds that there was no power on the emergency grid the UPS switched on its inverter and provided uninterrupted power to the cryogenic control system and the ODH system. All of the motorized equipment shut off instrument air compressor, vacuum pumps 1 and 2, insulating <b>vacuum</b> <b>blower,</b> glycol cooling pumps, cooling tower fan, and Exhaust Fan 7 (EF 7). Upon reengagement of power to the grid from the emergency generator, all of the motorized loads started back up with the exception of vacuum pumps 1 and 2, and the UPS inverter turned off. Vacuum pumps 1 and 2 were delay started 20 seconds by the cryogenic control system as not to cause too large of a surge in power by all of the inductive loads starting at once. The DO building elevator which is also on emergency power was test run while the emergency generator was on line with all other emergency loads. The emergency generator current was 140 amps with all loads on line and running except the building elevator. This load of 140 amps is 27 % of the generator's capacity. The cryogenic control and ODH system continued to function properly throughout the entire test due to the UPS responding correctly to each power situation. The cryogenic control system isolated both the Utility(UV) and insulating(IV) vacuum systems as to preserve their vacua while the pumps were off. Once the vacuum pumps were reestablished the IV and UV vacua were put back on line to their respective pumps by the cryogenic control system. The instrument air is backed up by a high pressure trailer, regulated down to instrument air pressure and switches automatically on line through a check valve. During the time that the instrument air compressor was off, instrument air never went below 80 psig (high pressure regulator setting) ...|$|E

The site is being considered by the US Department of Energy for construction of a high-level radioactive-waste repository. One of these two test holes (USW UZ- 1) has been equipped with instrumentation to obtain a long-term record of pressure and moisture potential data; the other test hole (USW UZ- 6) will be similarly instrumented in the near future. These investigations are being conducted {{as part of the}} Nevada Nuclear Waste Storage Investigations Project of the US Department of Energy. The test holes were drilled using a 5 - 1 / 2 -inch (14 -centimeter) by 8 - 5 / 8 -inch (22 -centimeter) dual-string reverse-vacuum assembly. A vacuum, induced at the land surface, removed the drill cuttings through the inner string. Compressed air was injected into the dual-string annulus to cool the bit and to keep the bit and inner string clean. A tracer gas, sulfur hexafluoride (SF{sub 6 }), was added to the compressed air for a later determination of atmospheric contamination that might have occurred during the drilling.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the modelling of gear rattle in Roots <b>blower</b> <b>vacuum</b> pumps. Analysis of experimental data reveals that the source of the noise and vibration problem is the backlash nonlinearity due to gear teeth losing and re-establishing contact. We derive simple non-smooth models for the lightly damped, lightly loaded dynamics of the pump. The models include a time-dependent forcing term which arises from the eccentric mounting of the gears acting at the gross rotation rate. We use a combination of explicit construction, asymptotic methods and numerical techniques to classify complicated dynamic behaviour in realistic parametric regimes. We first present a linear analysis of permanent-contact motions, and derive upper bounds on eccentricity for silent operation. We then develop a nonlinear analysis of ‘backlash oscillations’, where the gears lose and re-establish contact, corresponding to noisy pump operation. We show that noisy solutions can coexist with silent ones, explaining why geared systems can rattle intermittently. Finally, we consider possible design solutions, and show implications for pump design in terms of existence and stability of solutions. <br/...|$|R
40|$|High {{efficiency}} {{air blowers}} to meet future portable aerosol sampling applications were designed, fabricated, and evaluated. A Centrifugal blower {{was designed to}} achieve a flow rate of 100 L/min (1. 67 x 10 ^- 3 m^ 3 /s) and a pressure rise of WC " 4 (1000 PA). Commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, FLUENT 6. 1. 22, was used extensively throughout the entire design cycle. The machine, Reynolds number (Re), was around 10 ^ 5 suggesting a turbulent flow field. Renormalization Group (RNG) ?????????????? turbulent model was used for FLUENT simulations. An existing design was scaled down to meet the design needs. Characteristic curves showing static pressure rise {{as a function of}} flow rate through the impeller were generated using FLUENT and these were validated through experiments. Experimentally measured efficiency (????EXP) for the base-design was around 10 %. This was attributed to the low efficiency of the D. C. motor used. CFD simulations, using the ?????????????? turbulent model and standard wall function approach, over-predicted the pressure rise values and the percentage error was large. Enhanced wall function under-predicted the pressure rise but gave better agreement (less than 6 % error) with experimental results. CFD predicted a blower scaled 70 % in planar direction (XZ) and 28 % in axial direction (Y) and running at 19200 rpm (70 xz_ 28 y@ 19. 2 k) as the most appropriate choice. The pressure rise is 1021 Pa at the design flow rate of 100 L/min. FLUENT predicts an efficiency value based on static head (????FLU) as 53. 3 %. Efficiency value based on measured static pressure rise value and the electrical energy input to the motor (????EXP) is 27. 4 %.

40|$|Emission {{factors and}} {{emissions}} estimates are subject both to variability and uncertainty. Variability refers to real differences in emissions among multiple emission sources {{at any given}} time or over time for any individual emission source. Variability in emissions can be attributed to variation in: fuel or feedstock composition; ambient temperature; process design; process maintenance; and/or process operation. Uncertainty refers to lack of knowledge regarding the true value of emissions. Sources of uncertainty include: small sample sizes; lack of precision and/or accuracy in measurements; non-representativeness; or lack of data. In this paper, we demonstrate quantitative methods for characterizing both variability and uncertainty and apply the methods to case studies of emission factors for lawn and garden engines.
