40|$|Abstract — Motivated by {{the goals}} of {{improving}} detection of lowcontrast and narrow vessels and eliminating false detections at nonvascular structures, a new technique is presented for extracting vessels in retinal images. The core of the technique is a new likelihood ratio test that combines matched-filter responses, confidence measures and vessel boundary measures. Matched filter responses are derived in scale-space to extract vessels of widely varying widths. A vessel confidence measure {{is defined as a}} projection of a vector formed from a normalized pixel neighborhood onto a normalized ideal vessel profile. Vessel boundary measures and associated confidences are computed at potential vessel boundaries. Combined, these responses form a 6 -dimensional measurement vector at each pixel. A training technique is used to develop a mapping of this vector to a likelihood ratio that measures the “vesselness ” at each pixel. Results comparing this vesselness measure to matched filters alone and to measures based on the Hessian of intensities show substantial improvements both qualitatively and quantitatively. The Hessian can be used in place of the matched filter to obtain similar but less-substantial improvements or to steer the matched filter by preselecting kernel orientations. Finally, the new vesselness likelihood ratio is embedded into a <b>vessel</b> <b>tracing</b> framework, resulting in an efficient and effective vessel centerline extraction algorithm.

40|$|Abstract. An edge detection-based <b>vessel</b> <b>tracing</b> {{algorithm}} {{is presented to}} extract vascular tree structures present in medical images. Vasculatures are important features in biomedical image processing applications, such as in analyzing the biological process of angiogenesis. The presented algorithm first identifies points where blood vessels {{are likely to be}} then initiates traces from each identified seed point. For the task of vasculature extraction, the tracing algorithm has several advantages over traditional edge detection methods: reduction of the amount of pixel processing, isolation of blood vessels, and ensured connectedness. The {{algorithm is}} executed iteratively with decreasing seed point detection and trace termination thresholds to overcome the problem of variant contrast levels. This provides an adaptive approach to threshold selection and results in improved feature extraction. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes an {{automated}} blood vessel detection {{scheme based on}} adaptive contrast enhancement, feature extraction, and tracing. Feature extraction of small blood vessels is performed byusing the standard deviation of Gabor filter responses. Tracing of vessels is done via forward detection, bifurcation identification, and backward verification. Tests over twentyimages show that for normal images, the true positive rate (TPR) ranges from 80 % to 91 %, and their corresponding false positive rates (FPR) range from 2. 8 % to 5. 5 %. For abnormal images, the TPR ranges from 73. 8 % to 86. 5 % and the FPR ranges from 2. 1 % to 5. 3 %, respectively. In comparison with two published solution schemes that were also based on the STARE database, our scheme has lower FPR for the reported TPR measure.

The results confirmed the well-known effects of CA- 4 -P on the constriction of vessels. Furthermore, changes in the chromaticity suggest a deoxygenation of the blood with a recovery to initial levels in CA- 4 -P-treated tumours relative to the controls.

40|$|Abstract — The {{need for}} {{reliable}} identification of vessel contours from X-ray image sequences within a limited computation time {{is still a}} challenge in medical image analysis. In the literature, only a few vessel boundary extraction methods are suitable to meet automatic and real-time constraints for capturing and processing coronary artery cineangiograms. Among many approaches, <b>vessel</b> <b>tracing</b> algorithms {{are known to be}} fast and robust for practically detecting the vessel structures from live two- dimensional angiogram sequences. However, they often do not directly extract the boundary points and instead the locations of boundary points are achieved after identifying the correct position of centerline points. This boundary detection scheme seems to be less efficient in speed demanding clinical applications. In this paper a new algorithm for automatic tracing of vessel boundaries using an efficient estimation of local gradient vector is presented. The results illustrate that our method is a promising method for real-time vessel segmentation and linear feature extraction.

40|$|We propose an {{adaptive}} detection scheme for {{large and small}} blood vessels in color retinal images. Our scheme consists of three functions: adaptive contrast enhancement, feature extraction of blood vessels, and tracing. The average performance of our method over twenty tested images is 84. 3 % for true positive rate (TPR), and 3. 9 % for false positive rate (FPR). For normal images, the TPRs range from 80 % to 91 %, and their corresponding FPRs range from 2. 8 % to 5. 5 %. For abnormal images, the TPRs range from 73. 8 % to 86. 5 % and the FPRs range from 2. 1 % to 5. 3 %, respectively. Small vessels take up 42 % of overall vessel pixels, where 75 % of small vessels were captured by our method. Enhancement of blood vessels is achieved from {{the extension of the}} adaptive histogram equalization technique. Feature extraction of small blood vessels is by using the standard deviation of Gabor filter responses along different orientations. Tracing of the vascular network consists of three major functions: forward detection, backward verification, and bifurcation detection. Combining extrapolation and local greedy search reduces the prediction errors of vessel directions by 15 - 20 %. Only two sample images and their hand-traced maps are needed for parameter training and calibration.

40|$|An {{automatic}} algorithm {{capable of}} segmenting the whole vessel tree and calculate vessel diameter and orientation {{in a digital}} ophthalmologic image is presented in this work. The algorithm {{is based on a}} parametric model of a vessel that can assume arbitrarily complex shape and a simple measure of match that quantifies how well the vessel model matches a given angiographic image. An automatic <b>vessel</b> <b>tracing</b> algorithm is described that exploits the geometric model and actively seeks vessel bifurcation, without user intervention. The proposed algorithm uses the geometric vessel model to determine the vessel diameter at each detected central axis pixel. For this reason, the algorithm is fine tuned using a subset of ophthalmologic images of the publically available DRIVE database, by maximizing vessel segmentation accuracy. The proposed algorithm is then applied to the remaining ophthalmological images of the DRIVE database. The segmentation results of the proposed algorithm compare favorably in terms of accuracy with six other well established vessel detection techniques, outperforming three of them in the majority of the available ophthalmologic images. The proposed algorithm achieves subpixel root mean square central axis positioning error that outperforms the non-expert based vessel segmentation, whereas the accuracy of vessel diameter estimation is comparable to that of the non-expert based vessel segmentation.

40|$|Abstract — The aim of {{this study}} is about tracing {{filamentary}} structures in both neuronal and retinal images. It is often crucial to identify single neurons in neuronal networks, or separate vessel tree structures in retinal blood vessel networks, in applications such as drug screening for neurological disorders or computer-aided diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. Both tasks are challenging as the same bottleneck issue of filament crossovers is commonly encountered, which essentially hinders the ability of existing systems to conduct large-scale drug screening or practical clinical usage. To address the filament crossovers ’ problem, a two-step graph-theoretical approach is proposed in this paper. The first step focuses on segmenting filamentary pixels out of the background. This produces a filament segmentation map used as input for the second step, where they are further separated into disjointed filaments. Key to our approach is the idea that the problem can be reformulated as label propagation over directed graphs, such that the graph is to be partitioned into disjoint sub-graphs, or equivalently, each of the neurons (vessel trees) is separated {{from the rest of the}} neuronal (vessel) network. This enables us to make the interesting connection between the tracing problem and the digraph matrix-forest theorem in algebraic graph theory for the first time. Empirical experiments on neuronal and retinal image datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over existing methods.

Effects of angiopoietin- 1 (Ang- 1) and - 2 (Ang- 2) ± treatment with the vascular disrupting agent combretastatin A 4 P (CA 4 P) were investigated. Method SW 1222 human colorectal carcinoma cells were transfected with Ang- 1 or Ang- 2 cDNA, or with empty vector and implanted into ‘window’ chamber-bearing mice. Transmitted light images of tumours (x 10 objective) were acquired before and up to 24 h after treatment with 30 mg/kg CA 4 P or saline. <b>Vessel</b> <b>tracing</b> used a scale-space approach, employing differences in intensity of transmitted light between the vessels and surrounding tissues, as well as differences in the chromatic components, hue and saturation. The centreline of vessels was detected as a “ridge” in a topographical analogy and successive levels of filtering provided different scales to detect sharp to diffuse ridges. Morphological parameters were measured from the traced images - average vessel length (AL) width (AW), and relative vascular area (RA). Results The algorithm successfully identified the majority of tumour microvessels. CA 4 P-treated tumours showed a decrease in RA and increase in saturation balance up to 1 - 3 h, with recovery by 24 h. Saline had no effect.
