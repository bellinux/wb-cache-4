Each node has 4 PIN-diode detectors installed around the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pipeline</b> and a MCU based data collector. Ethernet connection is applied among the control PC and data collectors. A tiny TCP/IP stack has been designed and optimized for the MCU which gives the data collector ability to access Ethernet. The detail of the system design is given in this article...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} results of empirical investigations of a negative pressure difference in vacuum pipelines with internal diameters of 57, 81, 102 mm. The investigations were performed in an experimental installation of a vacuum sewage system, built in a laboratory hall {{on a scale of}} 1 : 1. The paper contains {{a review of the literature}} concerning two-phase flows (liquid-gas) in horizontal, vertical and diagonal pipelines. It {{presents the}} construction and working principles of the experimental installation of vacuum sewage system in steady and unsteady conditions during a two-phase flow of water and air. It also presents a methodology for determination of formula for calculation of a negative pressure difference in vacuum pipelines. The results obtained from the measurements of the negative pressure difference Δpvr in the vacuum pipelines were analyzed and compared with the results of calculations of the negative pressure difference Δpvr, obtained from the determined formula. The values of the negative pressure difference Δpvr calculated for the vacuum pipelines with internal diameters of 57, 81, and 102 mm with the use of Formula (19) coincide with the values of Δpvr measured in the experimental installation of a vacuum sewage system. The dependence of the negative pressure difference Δpvr along the length of the vacuum pipelines on the set negative pressure in the vacuum container pvzp is linear. The smaller the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pipeline</b> diameter, the greater the negative pressure difference Δpvr is along its length...|$|E

A low pressure system uses a small grinder pump located at each point of connection, typically a house or business. Vacuum sewer systems use differential atmospheric pressure to move the liquid to a central vacuum station.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose to}} develop high {{resolution}} tracking devices based on thin glass capillary arrays filled with liquid scintillator. This technique provides high 182 hit densities and position resolution better than 20 microm. Further, their radiation hardness makes them superior to {{other types of}} tracking devices with comparable performance. Therefore, the technique is attractive for inner tracking in collider experiments, microvertex devices, or active tar gets for short-lived particle detection. High integration levels in the optoelectronics readout based {{on the use of}} Electron Bombarded CCD (EBCCD) and the possibility of optical multiplexing reduces the number of output channels and, thus, the cost for the detector considerably. Moreover, development of good time resolution <b>Vacuum</b> Image <b>Pipeline</b> (VIP) will allow the use of this technique in high rate environments. The programme of an intense R&D effort on the above subjects is described...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{performance}} of a high-speed gateable <b>vacuum</b> image <b>pipeline,</b> which permits individual images to be delayed and selected from continuous non-repetitive image stream. This device is composed of a vacuum tube equipped with a photocathode at one end, a phosphor screen at the other end, and a system of metal grids in between. Photoelectrons produced by the images focused on the photocathode, are guided by a uniform, magnetic field, parallel to the tube axis. By changing the grid potentials, the drift time of the photoelectrons inside the tube can be varied from 0. 35 to 1. 5 mu s. An image can then be selected by an external trigger with a time resolution in the range of 4 - 30 ns, depending on the delay time. The selected photoelectrons are finally accelerated onto the phosphor screen, set at IO kV, where they reproduce the desired image. With a magnetic field of 0. 1 T, a spatial resolution of 33 lp/mm was obtained. The high spatial and time resolution make this device an interesting tool for high-energy physics and astrophysics experiments, and for high-speed photography...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{drainage}} through surface bore 2 {{has been}} the conventional means of methane control for U. S. longwall gobs. However, these vertical boreholes are becoming so costly, and the surface rights so difficult to obtain, that the Bureau of Mines is developing underground gob gas drainage as an alternate means of methane control for U. S. longwal [...] ls. Holes are drilled into the roof over the panel and on retreating longwalls, towards the working face from a location inby the face. As the longwall retreats, an increasing portion of the hole inter 2 the fracture system over the caved gob. A surface exhauster maintains a <b>vacuum</b> on a <b>pipeline</b> parelleling the panel and draws the methane mixture out of the mine. Auxiliary systems of gob gas drain 2 during longwall mining will be essen 2 for {{an increasing number of}} coal mines. Deep and gassy mines often find ventilation insufficient for adequate dilution of methane in bleeder entries. Although this cross-measure method of degasification has been used successfully in Europe, some of the European tech 2 cannot be directly applied to U. S. mines.

TROUBLESHOOTING - Allow the reaction to proceed at 90 °C for 48 h under reflux. Cool down to room temperature. - Precipitate the product in acetone (200 ml). Collect the precipitate by filtration. Wash the raw product with acetone. - Dissolve the solid into water/methanol (200 ml/ 50 ml) - ! CAUTION The solution could be heated towards 50 °C to afford a clear solution. - Fill a column (I. D. 30 × 250 mm) with Amberlite IRA- 900 ion-exchange resin and washed with MilliQ water till the effluent pH going neutral. - Transfer the solution from step 8 into the column and let it hold for 1 h. Subsequently, collect the effluent drop by drop. Flush the column with equal volume MilliQ water and collect the effluent. - Distill off water on rotary evaporator to yield C as a light yellow solid (9. 7 g, 78 % yield) - PAUSE POINT Compound C {{can be stored in}} oven at 80 °C for several weeks. - **Synthesis of compound D** - Fit a 250 -ml double-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar with a rubber septum and a Liebig condenser. Fit the condenser a rubber septum with inlet of dry N 2 and an outlet towards a bubbler containing paraffin oil, in order to prevent the ingress of moisture and air. - Weigh out compound C 2. 15 g (1. 72 mmol) into the flask. - Add 20 ml dried pyridine into the flask and switch on the magnetic stirrer and heater. - ! CAUTION Pyridine is highly toxic solvent. All experiments dealing with pyridine should be operated in fumehood. Goggles, gloves and mask should be worn. - Inject phenyl isocyanate 12 ml (110. 32 mmol) into the flask though a plastic syringe. - ! CAUTION Phenyl isocyanate has acute toxicity. It may cause severe skin burns and eye damage. It may cause allergy or asthma symptoms or breathing difficulties if inhaled. Adding 12 ml phenyl isocyanate as a whole would cause large extent of side reaction to produce triphenyl isocyanurate as a by-product. It is strongly recommended to add phenyl isocyanate dropwise with pressure equalizing funnel. Goggles, gloves and mask should be worn before experimental operation in fumehood. - ▲ CRITICAL STEP Phenyl isocyanate should be added with four equal portions. Add 12 ml as a whole would cause large extent of side reaction to produce triphenyl isocyanurate as a by-product. Add phenyl isocyanate drop by drop with pressure equalizing funnel would end up with its transformation in the funnel and the liquid colour changes to light yellow. - Allow the reaction to proceed at 85 °C for 20 h. Set up the <b>vacuum</b> distillation <b>pipeline.</b> - Distill off pyridine under reduced pressure at 85 °C. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Dissolve the residue with chloroform 15 ml. - Add the solution into silica column. Flush the impurities with n-hexane/ethyl acetate (70 : 30 v:v). - ▲ CRITICAL STEP The ratio of n-hexane/ethyl acetate was determined by TLC analyses. The flash column separation progress was also monitored by TLC analyses. Lowering the ratio would result in an increase of the amount of solvents used for eluting the impurities completely. - Flush the product out of the column with MeOH. - Remove the solvent on rotary evaporator to yield D as a dark yellow solid (6. 2 g, 66 % yield). - PAUSE POINT Compound D can be stored in oven at 80 °C for several weeks. - **Synthesis of vinylized silica E** - Dry spherical silica gel particles (5 μm, 5 g) in vacuum (10 mm Hg) at 150 °C for 24 h. Cool down to room temperature. - Fit a 250 -ml double-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar with a rubber septum and a Liebig condenser. Fit the condenser a rubber septum with inlet of dry N 2 and an outlet towards a bubbler containing paraffin oil, in order to prevent the ingress of moisture and air. - Add dry toluene 100 ml into the flask. Switch on the magnetic stirrer and heater. - Inject 3 -methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (2. 3 ml) into the flask. - Add dried silica gel from step 22 into the flask. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Allow the reaction to stand at 90 °C for 18 h. Product was collected by filtration through 0. 45 μm pore size membrane and washed with MeOH in Soxhlet apparatus overnight. - Collect the product by filtration through 0. 45 μm pore size membrane and washed with MeOH in Soxhlet extractor overnight. - Dry the product overnight in an oven at 60 °C in vacco to afford the vinylized silica E. - PAUSE POINT Vinylized silica E can be stored at room temperature for several months. - **Co-polymerization for preparation of IMPCSP** - Dissolve compound D (0. 7 g) in chloroform (30 ml). Filter the solution through 0. 45 μm pore size membrane. - Transfer the filtrate and drop onto vinylized silica gel E (1. 4 g) evenly with a glass syringe. - ! CAUTION A glass syringe was preferred to avoid any introduction of siloxal impurities from plastic syringes. Chloroform could corrode the rubber piston of the plastic syringe. - Dry the colloid-like mixture in vacuum (10 mm Hg) at 25 °C. - Fit a 100 -ml double-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar with two rubber septums. - Add the solid from step 32 into the flask. Add AIBN (3 mg) into the flask. - ▲ CRITICAL STEP The amount of AIBN should be controlled. A less amount of AIBN would lead to slow reaction rate but a great amount resulted in rapid radical reactions and short chain growth. In both conditions, successful immobilized CD amounts were low. - Inject anhydrous toluene (20 ml) and 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene (2. 6 ml) into the flask. - ▲ CRITICAL STEP 2, 3 -Dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene should be added before heating started. It was initiated together with the vinyl groups in compound D and vinylized silica E. Therein, 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene could act as a interlink. A delayed addition led to a lower CD amount on IMPCSP, since the radicals formed on D and E could have been annihilated before 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene was added. - Freeze the mixture in liquid N 2 in a Dewar dish and degas the reaction system in vacuum (10 mm Hg) for 0. 5 h. - ! CAUTION Liquid N 2 - Take the flask out of the Dewar dish and thaw at room temperature. - Repeat step 36 and 37 for three times. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Fit the flask with a Liebig condenser. Fit the condenser a rubber septum with inlet of dry N 2 and an outlet towards a bubbler containing paraffin oil, in order to prevent the ingress of moisture and air. - Switch on the magnetic stirrer and heater. Leave the reaction to proceed at 60 °C for 18 h. - Cool down the reaction mixture and collect the product by filtration through 0. 45 μm pore size membrane. - Wrap the filter cake with filter paper. Extract the solid in a Soxhlet extractor overnight. - Stop heating and collect the silica from the Soxhlet extractor. Dry the product in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h. - Pack IMPCSP into an empty stainless steel column with MeOH at 8, 000 psi for 30 min. - PAUSE POINT IMPCSP can be stored at room temperature for several months. ### Timing - Synthesis of B: ~ 40 h include synthesis of A. - Steps 1 - 11 Synthesis of C: Steps 1 - 5, 1 h; Step 6, 48 h; Steps 7 - 8, 1 h; Steps 9 - 10, 1 h; Step 11, 12 h. - Steps 12 - 21 Synthesis of D: Steps 12 - 14, 1 h; Step 15, 2 h; Step 16, 20 h; Step 17, 5 h; Steps 18 - 20, 12 h; Step 21, 12 h. - Steps 22 - 29 Preparation of E: Step 22, 12 h; Steps 23 - 25, 4 h; Steps 26 - 27, 18 h; Steps 28 - 29, 20 h. - Steps 30 - 44 Preparation of IMPCSP: Steps 30 - 32, 6 h; Steps 33 - 35, 1 h; Steps 36 - 38, 1 h; Steps 39 - 40, 20 h; Steps 41 - 42, 20 h; Step 43, 24 h; Step 44, 2 h. ### Troubleshooting **?
