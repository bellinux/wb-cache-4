2500|$|The <b>Viperidae</b> (<b>vipers)</b> is {{a family}} of venomous snakes found {{in most parts of}} the world, {{excluding}} Antarctica, Australia, New Zealand, Madagascar, Hawaii, various other isolated islands, and north of the Arctic Circle. All have relatively long, hinged fangs that permit deep penetration and injection of venom. Four subfamilies are currently recognised. They are also known as viperids. The name [...] "viper" [...] is derived from the Latin word vipera, -ae, also meaning viper, possibly from vivus [...] ("living") and parere ("to beget"), referring to the trait viviparity (giving live birth) common in vipers but not in snakes at large.|$|E
50|$|Mappes {{earned her}} MSc degree in 1991 and her PhD in 1994 from the University of Jyväskylä, Finland. Her {{doctoral}} thesis focused on reproductive tactics and maternal care in shield bugs, particularly the parent bug (Elasmucha grisea). Her other study species include the wood tiger moth (Parasemia plantaginis), <b>vipers</b> (<b>Viperidae),</b> the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) and the drumming wolf-spider (Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata).|$|R
5000|$|The fauna of the {{protected}} area {{consists of the}} mammals: deer (Cervidae), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), fox (Canidae), gray wolf ((Canis lupus), hare (Lepus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), wildcat (Felis silvestris) and the birds swan (Cygnus), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), greylag goose (Anser anser), woodcock (Scolopax) and common wood pigeon (Columba palumbus). The nature reserve is habitat for the reptiles such as <b>viper</b> (<b>Viperidae),</b> slow-worm (Anguis fragilis) and water snake. The lake {{is home to the}} fish species of carp (Cyprinidae), red seabream, bass (Perciformes) as well as to crustaceans like crayfish.|$|R
40|$|Envenomations by snakes of {{the family}} <b>Viperidae</b> (pit <b>vipers)</b> induce severe {{pathological}} alterations {{at the site of}} venom injection, such as edema, necrosis, hemorrhage, and blistering, which may lead to permanent tissue damage and disability. Edema is a prominent and common manifestation in these envenomations. The effect of viperid snake venoms in lymphatic vessels has not been previously investigated. This study analyzed the effect of the venom of Bothrops asper, the most important venomous snake in Central America, on the collecting lymphatic vessels of the mouse mesentery. The venom induced a rapid reduction in the lumen of these lymphatics, associated with a halting in the flow of lymph. These effects were reproduced by a myotoxic phospholipase A 2 homologue isolated from this venom, but not by a hemorrhagic metalloproteinase nor by a coagulant serine proteinase. B. asper venom, and the purified myotoxin, were cytotoxic for smooth muscle cells in culture, thus suggesting that the alterations observed in lymphatics are due to the effect on smooth muscle cells of the lymphatic vessel wall. These results demonstrate a direct effect of B. asper venom on lymphatics, which is likely to contribute to the prominent edema characteristic of these envenomations...|$|R
