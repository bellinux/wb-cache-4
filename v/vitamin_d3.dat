40|$|Acute {{myeloid leukemia}} (AML) -associated {{chromosomal}} translocations result in formation of chimeric transcription factors, such as PML/RARalpha, PLZF/RARalpha, and AML- 1 /ETO, {{of which the}} components are involved in regulation of transcription by chromatin modeling through histone acetylation/deacetylation. The leukemic differentiation block is attributed to deregulated transcription caused by these chimeric fusion proteins, which aberrantly recruit histone-deacetylase (HDAC) activity. One essential differentiation pathway blocked by the leukemic fusion proteins is the <b>vitamin</b> (Vit) <b>D(3)</b> signaling. Here we investigated the mechanisms by which the leukemic fusion proteins interfere with VitD(3) -induced differentiation. The VitD(3) -receptor (VDR) is, like the retinoid receptors RAR, retinoid X receptor, and the thyroid hormone receptor (TR), a ligand-inducible transcription factor. In the absence of ligand, the transcriptional activity of TR and RAR is silenced by recruitment of HDAC activity through binding to corepressors. In the presence of ligand, TR and RAR activate transcription by releasing HDAC activity and by recruiting histone-acetyltransferase activity. Here we report that VDR binds corepressors in a ligand-dependent manner and that inhibition of HDAC activity increases VitD(3) sensitivity of HL- 60 cells. Nevertheless, the inhibition of HDAC activity is unable to overcome the block of VitD(3) -induced differentiation caused by PLZF/RARalpha expression. Here we demonstrate that {{the expression of the}} translocation products PML/RARalpha and PLZF/RARalpha impairs the localization of VDR in the nucleus by binding to VDR. Furthermore, the overexpression of VDR in U 937 cells expressing AML-related translocation products completely abolishes the block of VitD(3) -induced differentiation. Taken together these data indicate that the AML-associated translocation products block differentiation not only by interfering with chromatin-modeling but also by sequestering factors involved in the differentiation signaling pathways, such as VDR in the VitD(3) -induced differentiation...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} whether 1, 25 (OH) (2) <b>D(3)</b> (<b>Vitamin</b> D 3) modulates T lymphocyte functions in patients transplanted for hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis. METHODS: Sixteen patients and ten healthy subjects were investigated. T lymphocytes were activated in vitro in the presence or absence of Vitamin D 3 and then the proliferative response and IFN-γ and TNF-α production were assessed. RESULTS: Vitamin D 3 potently reduced T-lymphocyte proliferation in a dose-related fashion. Similarly, FACS analysis and ELISA testing demonstrated that Vitamin D 3 significantly decreased the response frequency and the response intensity of IFN-γ and TNF-α production in the whole CD 3 -positive T lymphocyte population as well as in "naive" CD 4 + CD 45 RA+ and "memory" CD 4 + CD 45 RO+ T lymphocyte subsets. The inhibitory effect of Vitamin D 3 on T-cell proliferation and cytokine production was not different between patients and controls. No toxic effects were exerted by Vitamin D 3 even at the higher concentration used (10 nM). Finally, no statistically significant correlation was found between 25 (OH) D serum levels and the proliferative response or cytokine production of T lymphocytes from transplanted patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that in patients transplanted for hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis Vitamin D 3 modulates T lymphocyte activation, and provides a rationale for the evaluation of this compound as an immunosuppressive agent in liver-transplanted patients...|$|R

40|$|There are sparse data on genetic, {{epigenetic}} {{and vitamin}} D exposure in African Americans (AA) with colon polyp. Consequently, we evaluated serum 25 (OH) D levels, vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms and the methylation {{status of the}} tumor suppressor gene dickkopf homolog 1 (DKK 1) as risk factors for colon polyp in this population. The case-control study consisted of 93 patients with colon polyp (cases) and 187 healthy individuals (controls) at Howard University Hospital. Serum levels of 25 (OH) D (including D 3, D 2, and total) were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. DNA analysis focused on 49 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the VDR gene. Promoter methylation analysis of DKK 1 was also performed. The resulting data were processed in unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Cases and controls differed in <b>vitamin</b> D status (<b>D(3)</b> < 50 nmol/L: Median of 35. 5 in cases vs. 36. 8 in controls nmol/L; P =  0. 05).

The SNP analysis showed no association between 46 VDR polymorphisms and colon polyp. The promoter of the DKK 1 gene was unmethylated in 96 % of the samples.

40|$|In {{prolonged}} critical illness, increased bone resorption and osteoblast dysfunction {{have been}} reported facing low 25 hydroxy vitamin D [25 (OH) D] concentrations. The current study investigates {{the extent to which}} lack of nutritional vitamin D and time in intensive care contribute to bone loss in the critically ill. Prolonged critically ill patients (n = 22) were compared with matched controls and then randomized to daily vitamin D supplement of either +/- 200 IU (low dose) or +/- 500 IU (high dose). At intensive care admission, serum concentrations of 25 (OH) D, 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin <b>D(3),</b> <b>vitamin</b> D-binding protein, ionized calcium, IL- 1, and soluble IL- 6 -receptor were low, and PTH was normal. Circulating type-I collagen propeptides were high, alkaline phosphatase was normal, and osteocalcin was low. Bone resorption markers [(carboxy terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (betaCTX), pyridinoline, deoxypyridinoline (DPD) ] were 6 -fold increased. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was 40 -fold, IL- 6 400 -fold, TNFalpha levels 5 -fold, and osteoprotegerin concentrations 3 -fold higher than in controls. Soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand was undetectable. High-dose vitamin D only slightly increased circulating 25 hydroxy vitamin D (P < 0. 05), but 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D(3) was unaltered. High-dose vitamin D slightly increased serum osteocalcin (P < 0. 05) and decreased carboxy terminal propeptide type-I collagen (P < 0. 05) but did not affect other bone turnover markers. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, urinary pyridinoline and DPD, and serum betaCTX markedly increased with time (P < 0. 01). Circulating CRP and IL- 6 decreased with time, whereas TNFalpha and IL- 1 remained unaltered. The fall in CRP and IL- 6 was more pronounced with the high- than low-dose vitamin D (P < 0. 05). Except for a mirroring of betaCTX rise by a fall in osteoprotegerin, cytokines were unrelated to the progressively aggravating bone resorption. In conclusion, prolonged critically ill patients were vitamin D deficient. The currently recommended vitamin D dose did not normalize vitamin D status. Furthermore, severe bone hyperresorption further aggravated (up to 15 -fold the normal values) with time in intensive care and was associated with impaired osteoblast function. status: publishe...|$|R

The two most important factors that govern the generation of pre-vitamin D3 are the quantity (intensity) and quality (appropriate wavelength) of the UVB irradiation reaching the 7-dehydrocholesterol deep in the stratum basale and stratum spinosum.

As a consequence, {{there must have been a}} strong selective pressure for the evolution of light skin in areas of low UV radiation. The evidence that dark skin evolved as a protection against the effect of UV radiation is overwhelming, and research shows that eumelanin protects against both folate depletion and direct damage to DNA.

25|$|In the 1960s, {{biochemist}} W. Farnsworth Loomis {{suggested that}} skin colour {{is related to}} the body’s need for vitamin D.

A certain amount of vitamin D which penetrates the skin helps the body to absorb more calcium which is essential for building and maintaining bones, especially for developing embryos. Vitamin D production depends on exposure to sunlight. Humans living at latitudes far from the equator developed light skin in order to help absorb more vitamin D. People with light (type II) skin can produce previtamin D3 in their skin at rates 5–10 times faster than dark-skinned (type V) people. People living far from the equator were under evolutionary pressure to develop light skin, which allowed more penetration of UV radiation and helped to produce more of the essential vitamin D.|$|E
