5|$|The listroscelidine katydid Chlorobalius leucoviridis of inland Australia {{is capable}} of {{attracting}} male cicadas of the Tribe Cicadettini by imitating the species-specific reply clicks of sexually receptive female cicadas. This example of acoustic aggressive mimicry {{is similar to the}} Photuris firefly case in that the predator's mimicry is remarkably <b>versatile</b> – playback experiments show that C. leucoviridis is able to attract males of many cicada species, including Cicadettine cicadas from other continents, even though cicada mating signals are species-specific. The evolution of <b>versatile</b> mimicry in C. leucoviridis may have been facilitated by constraints on song evolution in duetting communication systems in which reply signals are recognizable only by their precise timing in relation to the male song (<< 100 ms reply latency).|$|E
5|$|A {{hardy and}} <b>versatile</b> garden plant, B.integrifolia is widely planted in Australian gardens. It {{is a popular}} choice for parks and streetscapes, and {{has been used for}} bush {{revegetation}} and stabilisation of dunes.

5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1850s, {{with the arrival of}} the Second French Empire, the Anglo-Norman became a popular breed in France, {{competing}} with the Thoroughbred. It was reputed to be a <b>versatile</b> horse, appropriate for riding and pulling light carriages. From 1840 to 1860, the breed was further influenced by part-Thoroughbred trotting horses from England. Local Norman mares were crossed with imported Thoroughbreds, Norfolk Trotters, Orlov Trotters and other crossbred horses, which themselves had Norfolk and Mecklenburger blood. By 1855, the quality of the resulting animals had ensured the breed's success, and the Anglo-Norman spread throughout France, especially supplanting another type of riding horse from the south, the Limousin horse. In 1864, the Société du cheval français de demi-sang (Society of French Half-Blood Horses) was founded, which later became the Société d'encouragement à l'élevage du cheval français (Society to Encourage French Horse Breeding). The breeders spread the description of Norman horses, particularly Anglo-Normans, as <b>versatile</b> horses that could be used for both riding and driving.|$|E
