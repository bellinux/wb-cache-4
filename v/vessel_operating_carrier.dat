50|$|A {{cellular}} vessel is {{a container}} ship specially {{designed for the}} efficient storage of freight containers {{one on top of}} other with vertical bracings at the four corners. The majority of <b>vessels</b> <b>operated</b> by maritime <b>carriers</b> are fully cellular ships.|$|R
30|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, ocean {{carriers are}} far more dependent now upon space allocations for NVOCCs, Global Forwarders and Third Party Logistics Operators. The larger non-asset service providers can get better prices from the steamship lines which they can resell to the Beneficial Cargo Owners. This offers BCOs greater flexibility to move cargo on various ships rather than those within their slot-sharing agreements. These ocean transportation intermediaries represent substantial cargo share to a <b>Vessel</b> <b>Operating</b> Common <b>Carrier</b> (VOCC) but are a more volatile segment {{of the market and}} rely on adding value to earn their fee in marked-up pricing. The alternative is to generate their income from commanding a volume discount from the VOCC and charging BCO market rates. In either case the result to the VOCC is a large customer with a price sensitive commodity and less brand loyalty than a BCO may have.|$|R
