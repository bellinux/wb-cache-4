5|$|Most trains {{that serve}} the Bloor–Danforth line are stored at the Greenwood Subway Yard, which opened {{with the first}} segment of the line. Before the yard was built, the land was {{occupied}} by a quarry and a garbage dump. Due to its location next to the Canadian National Railway tracks, {{it was possible for}} trains to be delivered directly to the subway. The CN rail tracks were converted to allow for the storage of more subway trains as the T-1 series trains were shifted from Yonge–University–Spadina line to the Bloor–Danforth line. In addition to providing storage for subway trains, the Greenwood yard is also used to maintain vehicles, which operate on Line 3 Scarborough as the McCowan RT Yard is only equipped for <b>vehicle</b> <b>storage</b> and to perform basic maintenance of vehicles.|$|E
5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, Patchway {{came under the}} aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. In 1949, there were 11 trains towards South Wales and 13 towards Bristol each weekday, with three trains per day in each direction on Sundays. However, by 1965 this had reduced to eight trains on weekdays towards South Wales and six towards Bristol, with no Sunday service. Traffic levels fell - the station was closed to goods traffic on 5 July 1965, and subsequently had all staff withdrawn on 14 October 1968. The goods loop was taken up and the station buildings demolished, replaced by small brick shelters. The structure of the footbridge remained, but the roof was removed. The goods yard was repurposed as <b>vehicle</b> <b>storage.</b>|$|E
5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{buildings of}} RAF Handforth are the government pay offices {{adjacent to the}} Total Fitness gym on Dairyhouse Lane. These buildings were the Headquarters of the depot and have survived in military/MoD use to this day. The depot had satellite sites within Cheadle Hulme, these being Site Number 5, general storage (beneath the Eden Park road housing development which, until the housing development began still maintained the internal road layout and building foundations) and site number 6 (motor transport storage area) which is now covered by part of the Hursthead housing estate. Three large (150ft × 250ft) steel built, <b>vehicle</b> <b>storage</b> sheds stood at the junction of Malmesbury Road and Lyncombe Close/Tintern Road. The last of these sheds survived well into the 1980s and was latterly used by the local council as a rubbish dump. This stood between Tollard Close and Tintern Road. The houses on May Avenue were built by the RAF as married quarters and exist to this day.|$|E

25|$|Daniel J Quirk, a local auto dealer, {{bought the}} {{property}} in 2004 {{for use as a}} motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>storage</b> and distribution facility. Before the Great Recession hit, he publicized plans to redevelop the yard into condominiums and a living history exhibit, and cited Marina Bay, which is located at the old Victory Destroyer Plant and the Charlestown Navy Yard as examples of what he wanted to turn the yard into. In 2006, as he was trying to sell the Goliath crane, he acknowledged that if he was unable to sell it, he would probably have it scrapped due to it becoming dangerous due to ongoing deterioration of the structure.|$|E
50|$|Certification for {{operations}} other than farms follows a similar process. The {{focus is on}} the quality of ingredients and other inputs, and processing and handling conditions. A transport company would be required to detail the use and maintenance of its <b>vehicles,</b> <b>storage</b> facilities, containers, and so forth. A restaurant would have its premises inspected and its suppliers verified as certified organic.|$|R

50|$|A rental {{agreement}} {{is often called}} a lease, especially when real estate is rented.

25|$|Guideways {{were made}} of {{concrete}} and based on highway construction techniques. The varying topography of the airport resulted in both aerial and ground level guideways winding their way over and under public roadways. As the guideway entered the semicircular terminals or remote parking areas, it remained at ground/ramp level and under the terminal building. At these terminal areas the guideway branched out to serve various stations, bypass tracks and <b>vehicle</b> <b>storage</b> sidings. Additional bypass guideways were constructed as the airport expanded. At several locations along the guideway tug sidings were located near the airport service road, allowing a disabled vehicle {{to be removed from}} the guideway and towed to the maintenance facility.|$|E
25|$|The car is spartan, {{although}} it features inflatable lumbar support and adjustable seats. Along with {{the absence of}} exterior door handles, the vehicle lacks side windows and a roof. Although a soft top cover was available, it was designed primarily for indoor <b>vehicle</b> <b>storage.</b> Side curtains of fabric and clear plastic operated by zippers can be inserted into the door and hand-bolted when needed. All of these decisions were made to reduce weight. The battery {{is located in the}} sealed compartment over the rear wheels to increase rear-end weight and traction. The car shipped with a tonneau cover and video tape on soft-top assembly (the soft top is removable and folds to fit in the trunk). In 1994 the car came, {{for the first time since}} release with several options available to the buyer. These included air conditioning, adjustable suspension, larger diameter wheels to accommodate larger brakes, and a fiberglass hardtop for the roof.|$|E
2500|$|Ivy City {{remained}} an industrial area into the 2000s. [...] Fast food restaurants, commercial printers, automobile repair shops, and used auto parts stores were {{common in the}} neighborhood.

2500|$|During World War II, Ivy City {{became a}} backwater. Little {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the neighborhood, and the war effort meant that the railroad's needs took precedence over that of the average resident. [...] Industrial buildings, warehouses, <b>vehicle</b> <b>storage</b> lots, and junkyards proliferated in Ivy City. As World War II came to a close, Ivy City's infrastructure was also beginning to deteriorate. Residents complained about poorly paved streets, a lack of sidewalks, no street lighting, crumbling and trash-filled alleys, and a complete lack of stormwater drainage. (Until the 2000s, Ivy City continued to be particularly hard-hit by stormwater flooding. The intersection of West Virginia Avenue NE and Mt. Olivet Road NE was inundated every time there was significant rainfall.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Quality {{gasoline}} {{should be}} stable {{for six months}} if stored properly but gasoline will break down slowly over time due to {{the separation of the}} components. Gasoline stored for a year will most likely be able to be burned in an internal combustion engine without too much trouble but the effects of long term storage will become more noticeable with each passing month until a time comes when the gasoline should be diluted with ever-increasing amounts of freshly made fuel so that the older gasoline may be used up. If left undiluted, improper operation will occur and this may include engine damage from misfiring and/or the lack of proper action of the fuel within a fuel injection system and from an onboard computer attempting to compensate (if applicable to the <b>vehicle).</b> <b>Storage</b> should be in an airtight container (to prevent oxidation or water vapors mixing in with the gas) that can withstand the vapor pressure of the gasoline without venting (to prevent the loss of the more volatile fractions) at a stable cool temperature (to reduce the excess pressure from liquid expansion, and to reduce the rate of any decomposition reactions). When gasoline is not stored correctly, gums and solids may be created, which can corrode system components and accumulate on wetted surfaces, resulting in a condition called [...] "stale fuel". Gasoline containing ethanol is especially subject to absorbing atmospheric moisture, then forming gums, solids, or two phases (a hydrocarbon phase floating on top of a water-alcohol phase).|$|E
