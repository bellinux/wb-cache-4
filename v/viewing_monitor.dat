The [...] "monochrome" [...] version of each mode turns off the NTSC color decoding in the <b>viewing</b> <b>monitor</b> completely, resulting in a black-and-white picture, but also no color bleeding, hence, a sharper picture.On RGBI monitors, the two versions of each mode are identical, with the exception of the 320x200 graphics mode, where the [...] "monochrome" [...] version produces the third palette, as described above.|$|E

Volunteering to represent the organisation, Scarlet leaves in a Spectrum Jet. Ordered to bail out over Greenland by the disembodied Mysteron voice, Scarlet observes from the air as his aircraft loses altitude and crashes.

40|$|Background and Aims: Endoscopic {{training}} {{can be challenging}} for the trainee and preceptor. Frustration can result from ineffective communication regarding areas of interest. Our team developed a novel tablet application for real-time mirroring of the colonoscopy examination that allows preceptors to make annotations directly on the <b>viewing</b> <b>monitor.</b> The potential for improvement in team proficiency and satisfaction is unknown. Methods: The on-screen endoscopic image is mirrored to an Android tablet and permits real-time annotation directly on the in-room endoscopic image display. Preceptors can also “freeze-frame” an image and provide visual on-screen instruction (telestration). Trainees, precepted by a GI attending, were 1 : 1 randomized to perform colonoscopy on a training phantom using the application with traditional precepting or traditional precepting alone. Magnetized polyps (size < 5 mm) were placed in 1 of 5 preset location scenarios. Each trainee performed a total of 10 colonoscopies and completed each location scenario twice. During withdrawal, the trainee and the attending identified polyps. Outcome measures included number of polyps missed and participant satisfaction after each trial. Results: Fifteen trainees (6 novice and 9 GI fellows) performed a total of 150 colonoscopies where 330 polyps in total were placed. Fellows missed fewer polyps using the tablet versus traditional precepting alone (4. 2 % vs 12. 5 %; P =. 04). There {{was no significant difference}} in missed polyps for novices (12. 5 % vs 18. 8 %; P =. 66). Overall, fellows missed fewer polyps when compared with novices regardless of the precepting method (P =. 01). The attending and all trainees reported reduced stress with improved communication using the tablet. Conclusions: Fellows missed fewer polyps using the tablet when compared with traditional endoscopy precepting. All trainees reported reduced stress, quicker identification of polyps, and improved educational satisfaction using the tablet. Our application has the potential to improve trainee plus attending team lesion detection and to enhance the endoscopy training experience for both the trainee and attending preceptor...|$|E

30|$|The {{opinion of}} {{participants}} also largely diverted on the statement whether {{the objects of}} their interest {{were in the middle}} of the screen both during Navigation and Peg-in-Hole tasks.

Therefore, we need a further investigation on what kind of visual support the operator wants during various task scenarios.|$|R
