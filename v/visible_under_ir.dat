40|$|We report {{specifically}} two things, one {{the phenomenon}} of optically induced motion in pristine single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) on the macro-scale and other the consequent separation of metallic and semiconducting enriched SWNT aggregates. Experiments provide direct evidence of {{both positive and negative}} photophoresis of SWNTs in solution i. e. motion away and towards light respectively. This optically induced motion was found to be dependent on frequency and intensity of light. Aggregates of pristine SWNT, moving <b>under</b> UV and <b>Visible</b> lamp were separated and characterized using absorption and Raman spectroscopy. Aggregates separated from pristine SWNT show enrichment in metallic or semiconducting SWNTs, depending on the spectral frequency of the lamp. Photophoresis in selective SWNTs show direct relation between frequency of illumination and absorption of specific nanotubes. The observed phenomenon is also verified using pre-separated, metallic and semiconducting SWNTs in solution. Metallic SWNTs show enhanced photophoresis with an UV lamp, whereas pre-separated semiconductor SWNT exhibit motion with a mercury lamp with broadband <b>visible</b> frequency. However, <b>under</b> <b>IR</b> lamp, both metallic and semiconducting enriched SWNT show continuous motion, as seen for un-separated pristine SWNTs, where no specificity was observed and all particles were seen moving.

40|$|Abstract—Microwaves are {{non-ionizing}} electromagnetic radiation. With {{the growth}} of technology and increase in demand of cellular services day by day; the presence of microwaves in environment is also increasing. Mostly these services are operated at 945 MHz. The wavelength of microwaves spans from one meter to one millimeter, covering the spectrum from 300 MHz to 300 GHz. These frequencies may {{affect the quality of}} the microwaves treated plant seeds and may reduce their fertility. This paper presents the results of some investigations carried out using microwaves treated Brassica seeds on IR (Infra-Red) irradiation. The spectrum of both microwaves treated and untreated seeds was studied <b>under</b> <b>visible</b> and <b>IR</b> radiation. It was observed that increasing the duration or power of the microwaves significantly affected the irradiated spectrum. Increasing the microwaves exposure decreases the IR absorption coefficient of the seeds. Further, microwaves reduce the fluid content of the seeds, which may affect the fertility of the seeds. The results may be useful for the development of an automatic quality assessment system for seeds. Index Terms—Microwaves, IR, Brassica Juncea...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the possibility of avoiding formation of Er-rich oxide clusters in ErAl 3 O 6 –TiO 2 –SiO 2 glassy films. Samples containing 0. 5, 1 and 3 mol% Er 31 were prepared using a precursor with a single, isolated Er-ion, ErAl 3 (OPri) 12, in the metal–organic sol–gel route. The thermal decomposition of the gel films to form amorphous oxide films was studied by thermogravimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), powder X-ray diffraction and {{by means of a}} transmission electron microscope, equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer. The microscopy studies of the oxide films obtained after 2 h at 9008 C showed that they were amorphous and free of Er-rich clusters. The optical and vibrational properties of the glasses were studied using FT-IR, Raman scattering and luminescence spectroscopy. The samples exhibit luminescence both in the <b>visible</b> and <b>IR</b> <b>under</b> excitation of the 514. 5 and 488 nm Ar 1 laser lines. The emission around 1. 5 mm was maximum for the 1 mol% sample. The results show that the preparation technique can produce samples with an unusually large amount of Er doping, before Er-clustering induced quenching of the luminescence appears. Up-converted emission was also detected around 21 000 and 24 500 cm 21. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Snipers {{also have}} to take into account their {{appearance}} <b>under</b> infrared (<b>IR)</b> light, because many armed forces now employ thermal vision devices that work in this spectrum of light as opposed to normal night vision devices that simply gathers and intensifies normal light. Some clothes or equipment stand out when viewed with thermal vision devices and care has to be taken in selecting and covering equipment so that the sniper is not readily <b>visible</b> when viewed <b>under</b> infrared light. Clothing or equipment not readily <b>visible</b> <b>under</b> infrared light is said to have a [...] "low IR signature". Plastic or foil [...] "thermal blankets" [...] can also be employed to cover a sniper and their equipment, but these in turn must then be camouflaged (often local foliage or material).|$|R
40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} (IR) is {{an important}} stress factor in the central nervous system, thereby aggravating neuropathogenesis and triggering cognitive decline. Melatonin, which is an antioxidant phytochemical and synthesized by the pineal gland, has multiple functions in cellular responses such as apoptosis and survival against stress. This study investigated whether melatonin modulates the signaling of neuronal cell death induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress <b>under</b> <b>IR</b> condition using SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells. Apoptosis cell death signaling markers (cleaved Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP), p 53, and Bax) and ER stress markers (phosphorylated eIF 2 α (p-eIF 2 α), ATF 4, CHOP, p-IRE 1, and spliced XBP 1 (sXBP 1)) were measured using reverse transcription-PCR, quantitative PCR, and western blottings. Immunofluorescence staining was also performed for p-ASK 1 and p-IRE 1. The mRNA or protein expressions of cell death signaling markers and ER stress markers were increased <b>under</b> <b>IR</b> condition, but significantly attenuated by melatonin treatment. Insulin-induced activation of ASK 1 (p-ASK 1) was also dose dependently attenuated by melatonin treatment. The regulatory effect of melatonin on neuronal cells <b>under</b> <b>IR</b> condition was associated with ASK 1 signaling. In conclusion, the result suggested that melatonin may alleviate ER stress <b>under</b> <b>IR</b> condition, thereby regulating neuronal cell death signaling...|$|R
40|$|ZnO nanocrystals {{have been}} made excitable under UV as well as near and far {{infrared}} (IR) wavelengths (980 nm, 1550 nm) through doping of rare earth ion Er 3 + thus making it a triple excitation nanophosphor. Whereas the <b>visible</b> emission <b>under</b> UV is broad due to intrinsic donor acceptor pair recombination, the sharp green and red emission peaks <b>under</b> <b>IR</b> are characteristic of f-f transitions of the Er 3 + ion. Thus both down and upconversion fluorescence in ZnO could be realised through doping of rare earth ion Er 3 + that also makes ZnO: Er 3 + nanocrystals paramagnetic. To {{the best of our}} knowledge we are reporting upconversion at 1550 nm in ZnO: Er 3 + for the first time...|$|R
