25|$|The {{demand for}} {{telephones}} was ever increasing {{and in the}} 1990s Indian government was under increasing pressure {{to open up the}} telecom sector for private investment as a part of Liberalisation-Privatisation-Globalisation policies that the government had to accept to overcome the severe fiscal crisis and resultant balance of payments issue in 1991. Consequently, private investment in the sector of <b>Value</b> <b>Added</b> <b>Services</b> (VAS) was allowed and cellular telecom sector were opened up for competition from private investments. It was during this period that the Narsimha Rao-led government introduced the National Telecommunications policy (NTP) in 1994 which brought changes in the following areas: ownership, service and regulation of telecommunications infrastructure. The policy introduced the concept of telecommunication for all and its vision was to expand the telecommunication facilities to all the villages in India. Liberalisation in the basic telecom sector was also envisaged in this policy. They were also successful in establishing joint ventures between state owned telecom companies and international players. Foreign firms were eligible to 49% of the total stake. The multi-nationals were just involved in technology transfer, and not policy making.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Using {{data from}} 104 {{countries}} over a six-year period (2009 - 2014), this study proposes a value-added predictor in service industries {{based on the}} eight indicators of the prosperity index, namely economy, entrepreneurship and opportunity, governance, education, health, safety and security, personal freedom, and social capital. Design/methodology/approach: The fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and complexity theory, a relatively novel approach for developing and testing the conceptual model, are used for asymmetric modelling of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> in <b>service</b> industries, and the predictive validity of the proposed configural model is tested. Findings: Apart from advancing method and theory, this study simulates causal conditions (i. e., recipes) leading to both high and low scores of the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> of <b>services.</b> The configural conditions indicating a high/low level of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> in <b>service</b> industries {{can be used as}} a guiding strategy for marketers, investors and policy makers. Originality/value: An analysis of worldwide data provides complex models demonstrating both how to regulate country conditions to achieve a high value-added score and select a foreign country for investment that offers a high level of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>service...</b>|$|R
