50|$|Performing the suPARnostic ELISA {{requires}} two antibodies {{with high}} specificity for suPAR.

After the final wash step, the plate is developed by adding the TMB substrate to produce a <b>visible</b> <b>signal,</b> which indicates the quantity of suPAR in the sample.

5000|$|Performing an ELISA {{involves}} {{at least}} one antibody with specificity for a particular antigen.

40|$|A novel {{class of}} organic {{nanoparticles}} as biolabels that can generate an instant <b>visible</b> <b>signal</b> {{was applied to}} immunodipsticks. A new principle for signal generation based on hydrolysis of colourless signal precursor molecules to produce coloured signal molecules followed by signal precipitation and localization was demonstrated. The nanoparticle biolabels were applied to sandwich immunoassays {{for the detection of}} mouse immunoglobulin G (M IgG). In the presence of M IgG, a nanoparticle-immunocomplex was formed and bound on the test zone immobilized with goat anti M IgG (Gt α M IgG). A blue line was developed on the test zone upon the addition of a signal developing reagent. An optical signal could be simply assessed using naked eyes or quantified using a reading device. The lowest <b>visible</b> <b>signal</b> that could be observed using naked eyes was found to be 1. 25 μgL- 1 M IgG. The nanoparticle biolabel also showed a better sensitivity (signal-to-noise ratio) compared with the conventional colloidal gold biolabel.

These colours provide strong contrast with green foliage, resist changes in shadow and lighting, have strong contrast, are highly chromatic, and provide distance dependent camouflage. Some forms of warning colouration provide this distance dependent camouflage by having an effective pattern and colour combination that do not allow for easy detection by a predator from a distance, but are warning-like from a close proximity, allowing for an advantageous balance between camouflage and aposematism. Warning colouration evolves in response to background, light conditions, and predator vision. <b>Visible</b> <b>signals</b> may be accompanied by odours, sounds or behaviour to provide a multi-modal signal which is more effectively detected by predators.|$|R
