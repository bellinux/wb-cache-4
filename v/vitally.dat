5|$|A person's {{adjustment}} to cancer depends <b>vitally</b> {{on the support}} of their family and other informal carers, but pain can seriously disrupt such interpersonal relationships, so people with cancer and therapists should consider involving family and other informal carers in expert, quality-controlled psychosocial therapeutic interventions.|$|E
5|$|In April 1942, Brigadier General Spencer Akin and his Australian {{counterpart}} at LHQ, Major General Colin Simpson, {{agreed to}} pool their resources {{and establish a}} combined intelligence organisation, known as the Central Bureau. The Australian, British, and US Armies, {{as well as the}} RAAF and the RAN all supplied personnel for this formation, which worked on codebreaking and decrypting Japanese message traffic. This Magic and Ultra intelligence was <b>vitally</b> important to operations in SWPA.|$|E
5|$|Scouts South Africa is {{actively}} involved in community work, particularly {{in the rural areas}} of South Africa. In some rural areas, such as the greater Tzaneen area, there are Troops with over 100 Scouts. Rural Troops are often limited in their activities by funding and lack of equipment. Their programme focuses on educating the Scouts in becoming good citizens and in the dangers of HIV. Educating Scouts in HIV and AIDS is <b>vitally</b> important due to the large number of infections in both rural and urban areas of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|The Congo {{was also}} a <b>vitally</b> {{important}} economic asset to the Allied powers. The Congo's gold alone contributed some $28.5 million to the Allied war effort, while its exports of rubber and uranium provided vital sources of raw materials. Most of the uranium used during the American Manhattan Project – including that used for the nuclear weapons dropped on the Japanese towns of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – was supplied by the Belgian firm Union Minière du Haut Katanga from Katanga Province in the Belgian Congo.|$|E
5|$|The first {{example of}} a dinitrogen complex to be {{discovered}} was 2+ (see figure at right), and soon many other such complexes were discovered. These complexes, in which a nitrogen molecule donates at least one {{lone pair of electrons}} to a central metal cation, illustrate how N2 might bind to the metal(s) in nitrogenase and the catalyst for the Haber process: these processes involving dinitrogen activation are <b>vitally</b> important in biology and in the production of fertilisers.|$|E
5|$|Trucks are <b>vitally</b> {{important}} to U.S. industry, however, measuring {{the impact of}} trucking on the economy is more difficult, because trucking services are so intertwined with all sectors of the economy. According to the measurable share of the economy that trucking represents, the industry directly contributes about 5 percent to {{the gross domestic product}} annually. In addition, the industry plays a critical support role for other transportation modes and for other sectors of the economy such as the resource, manufacturing, construction, and wholesale and retail trade industries.|$|E
5|$|After the United States entered World War II on December 7, 1941, the Federal {{government}} {{set up the}} War Shipping Administration {{to manage}} the <b>vitally</b> important maritime shipping and Naval support needs of the U.S. and its Allies, including the power to expropriate civilian-owned boats. On April 1, 1942, the government acquired the Old Bay Line's State of Virginia and State of Maryland. On July 13, the President Warfield and Yorktown were also taken over. Thus, by mid-1942, four of the Old Bay Line's six ships had become government property, leaving the company only the two oldest and smallest ships in its fleet {{for the duration of}} the war, the City of Norfolk and City of Richmond.|$|E
5|$|Emil Pagliarulo, {{a former}} writer at Looking Glass Studios, was {{commissioned}} by Bethesda to write the main script of Fallout 3; although he worked in part to 's script. Pagliarulo took charge of writing the incipit of Fallout 3, then played by Ron Perlman, {{and he tried to}} be inspired by first Fallout's incipit, in 1997, which he considered <b>vitally</b> important to describe the story that Fallout 3 would have to tell. To succeed in making this script effective, Pagliarulo, had to go in the opposite direction to his previous work on Oblivion, which both for setting and characters, represented an extreme Fallout inverse.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding <b>vitally</b> effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E
5|$|James Livingston had {{advanced}} to Montgomery {{the idea of}} taking Fort Chambly, near where his militia was encamped. One of Livingston's captains, Jeremy Duggan, had, on September 13, floated two nine-pound guns past St. Jean, and these guns were put to use to that end. Chambly, which was garrisoned by only 82 men, mostly from the 7th Foot, was surrendered on October 18 by its commander, Major Joseph Stopford, after two days of bombardment. Most seriously, Stopford failed to destroy supplies that were <b>vitally</b> useful to the Americans, primarily gunpowder, but also winter provisions. Six tons of powder, 6,500 musket cartridges, 125 muskets, 80 barrels of flour and 272 barrels of foodstuff were captured.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December, Vandermaesen made a {{stand before}} Port Napoleon, {{defending}} {{the entrance to}} the town with his available regular troops and some small cannon. Keating attacked him, engaging the French front while a second attack by Madras sepoys outflanked the French line and disrupted it, allowing a successful frontal assault. With their defences breached the French fell back and on 2 December Decaen proposed a ceasefire, which was accepted. The following day Decaen surrendered, although with guarantees that he and the garrison would be repatriated and allowed to retain their personal arms and Eagles. Although some in the British force were unhappy with the terms of the surrender, the British commanders were relieved to have the invasion complete before the hurricane season began later in the month. The danger to the 70 ships in the British fleet from such a storm was serious and it was <b>vitally</b> important that they be in a safe harbour when the hurricane season began.|$|E
5|$|Following Jardine's appointment, {{a meeting}} was {{arranged}} with Nottinghamshire captain Arthur Carr {{and his two}} fast bowlers Larwood and Voce at London's Piccadilly Hotel. Jardine explained his belief that Bradman was weak against bowling directed at leg stump and that if this line of attack could be maintained, it would restrict Bradman's scoring {{to one side of}} the field, giving the bowlers greater control of his scoring. Jardine asked Larwood and Voce if they could bowl accurately on leg stump and make the ball rise up into the body of the batsman. The bowlers agreed that they could, and that it might prove effective, but Jardine stressed that bowling accurately was <b>vitally</b> important, or Bradman would dominate the bowling. Larwood believed that Jardine saw Bradman as his main target and wished to attack him psychologically as well as in a cricketing sense. At the same time, other Australian batsmen were also discussed. Larwood and Voce practised the plan over the remainder of the 1932 season with mixed success. Jardine also visited Frank Foster who had toured Australia in 1911–12 to discuss field placings appropriate to Australian conditions. Foster had bowled leg theory on that tour with his fielders placed close in on the leg-side, as had George Hirst in 1903–04. During the second half of the season, the team to tour Australia was announced. The selection of four fast bowlers and a few medium pacers was very unusual at the time, and it was commented on by the hosts' media, including Bradman. The selection of Eddie Paynter, who did not have a strong record, to replace the ill Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji was very likely a choice of Jardine. He had a history of good performances against Yorkshire, and Jardine considered that a player's record against northern counties was a good indication of his potential at international level.|$|E
5|$|Transferred to the Channel Fleet, Leviathan was {{attached}} to service under Lord Howe and served with him during the Atlantic campaign of May 1794 alongside John Willett Payne, captain of HMS Russell. The campaign culminated in the Glorious First of June, when a French fleet was defeated by Howe's innovative tactics, but was ultimately successful in protecting a large grain convoy from the United States. Seymour's command of Leviathan was <b>vitally</b> important in the victory, the ship fighting at the initial engagement of the 28 May and seeing extensive action during the battle itself. Seymour {{was one of only}} a few of Howe's commanders to successfully close with the French line, although he was unable to break through it. Leviathan then engaged closely with America, which she reduced to a battered wreck in a duel that lasted two hours. Leviathan was also badly damaged, having taken fire from Éole and Trajan during the fighting. At Howe's order, Seymour then left America (which was later captured) and joined the reformed fleet that held off a French counter-attack in the latter stages of the battle. In the aftermath of the action, Seymour was one of the captains marked out for praise, being presented with a medal commemorating his service during the engagement. Leviathan had suffered 11 killed and 32 wounded in the engagement.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>vitally</b> {{important}} that all braking {{is done in}} a controlled manner, as any sudden shocks impose very high loads on the rack rail and pinion wheels, and can cause damage.|$|E
25|$|Bile is {{the major}} pathway for the {{excretion}} of copper and is <b>vitally</b> important in the control of liver copper levels. Most fecal copper results from biliary excretion; the remainder is derived from unabsorbed copper and copper from desquamated mucosal cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} of Dominican-American cuisine {{goes beyond the}} consumption of the food, however. It is <b>vitally</b> integrated into the everyday culture of the Dominican-American community. Through the sensations of eating, to the act of cooking, Dominican-American food {{is part of the}} Dominican-American experience.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{practical}} applications have motivated {{the development of}} mathematical theories, which then {{became the subject of}} study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is <b>vitally</b> connected with research in pure mathematics.|$|E
25|$|Although the Maya {{calendar}} was {{not tied}} to the Sun, John Teeple has proposed that the Maya calculated the solar year to somewhat greater accuracy than the Gregorian calendar. Both astronomy and an intricate numerological scheme for the measurement of time were <b>vitally</b> important components of Maya religion.|$|E
25|$|Understanding how {{a corpse}} {{decomposes}} and {{the factors that}} may alter the rate of decay is extremely important for evidence in death investigations. Campobasso, Vella, and Introna consider the factors that may inhibit or favor the colonization of insects to be <b>vitally</b> important when determining the time of insect colonization.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{work began}} at the park in 1976 to uncover {{the remains of the}} village. Greenwood Furnace was {{designated}} a Historical Landmark in 1995 by ASM International in recognition of the superior quality iron that was produced by Greenwood Iron and was <b>vitally</b> important to the westward expansion of the railroads.|$|E
25|$|YWAM ship {{equipped}} ministries, {{the maritime}} arm of YWAM's Mercy Ministries, uses ships to bring {{physical and spiritual}} healing {{to the poor and}} needy. YWAM ships have provided <b>vitally</b> important surgeries, dental care, medical supplies, food, seeds, construction materials, development projects, training, and their message to the isolated islands and rivers of the world.|$|E
25|$|Bells were <b>vitally</b> {{important}} to daily life at any mission. The bells were rung at mealtimes, {{to call the}} Mission residents to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with ringing the mission bells.|$|E
25|$|In 1826, Heligoland {{became a}} seaside spa and soon {{it turned into}} a popular tourist resort for the European upper-class. The island {{attracted}} artists and writers, especially from Germany and Austria who apparently enjoyed the comparatively liberal atmosphere, including Heinrich Heine and August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben. More <b>vitally</b> it was a refuge for revolutionaries of the 1830s and the 1848 German revolution.|$|E
25|$|One {{central and}} <b>vitally</b> {{important}} agreement was the Statute of Westminster 1931, which conferred full self-government upon the Dominions Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, while preparing {{the first steps}} towards the eventual Commonwealth of Nations, {{and away from the}} designation 'British Empire'. In 1930, the first British Empire Games sports competition was held successfully among Empire nations in Hamilton, Canada.|$|E
25|$|The {{increased}} RAM of the 512K was <b>vitally</b> {{important for}} the Macintosh as it finally allowed for more powerful software applications, such as the then-popular program Microsoft Multiplan. However, Apple continued to market the 128K {{for over a year}} as an entry-level computer, the mid-level 512K and high-end Lisa (and claiming that it could be easily expanded should the user ever need more RAM).|$|E
25|$|Despite this, {{the brigade}} did achieve a <b>vitally</b> {{important}} task {{in nearly a}} week of night-and-day fighting. While they fought on from Muar Harbour to Parit Sulong Bridge, stalling the Imperial Guards Division, strongly backed by air and tank support, the three brigades of Westforce in the Segamat area were able to withdraw safely down the central trunk road to Labis, and thence towards the key crossroads at Yong Peng.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, Chicago {{was one of}} {{the most}} unionized cities in the world. Nearly 243,000 Chicagoans belonged to unions, about a quarter of the workforce. One-third of these worked in a single {{industry}} (meatpacking). The Teamsters were <b>vitally</b> important to the Chicago labor movement, for a sympathy strike by the Teamsters could paralyze the movement of goods throughout the city and bring a strike into nearly every neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{confusion}} {{about the idea of}} dissonance is created by the fact that musicians and writers sometimes use the word dissonance and related terms in a precise and carefully defined way, more often in an informal way, and very often in a metaphorical sense ("rhythmic dissonance"). For many musicians and composers, the essential ideas of dissonance and resolution are <b>vitally</b> important ones that deeply inform their musical thinking on a number of levels.|$|E
25|$|Many Lebanese civilians voluntarily {{joined the}} rescue effort. Especially {{important}} was a Lebanese construction contractor, Rafiq Hariri {{of the firm}} Oger-Liban, who provided heavy construction equipment, e.g., a 40-ton P & H crane, etc., from nearby BIA worksites. Hariri's construction equipment proved <b>vitally</b> necessary in lifting and removing heavy slabs of concrete debris at the barracks site {{just as it had}} been necessary in assisting with clearing debris after the April U.S. Embassy attack.|$|E
25|$|An issue arose as {{to whether}} the Admiralty should retain control of {{warehouses}} at Gibraltar, which were then underused. Tryon reported that in the event of war, stores immediately available at Gibraltar might be <b>vitally</b> important to the fleet, and that at such a time it would be virtually impossible to get back storage space relinquished in peace time. He {{was one of the few}} at that time to recognise the port's strategic significance for the fleet.|$|E
25|$|Madame Montour's {{village of}} Otstonwakin or Ostuagy was a <b>vitally</b> {{important}} location during {{the settlement of}} what is now Lycoming County. Her village at the mouth of Loyalsock Creek on the West Branch Susquehanna River was an important stopping point for the Moravian missionaries who were spreading the gospel throughout the wilderness of Pennsylvania during the 1740s. Count Zinzendorf, a missionary being guided by Conrad Weiser with the permission of Shikellamy, came to Ostuagy in 1742.|$|E
25|$|Elk Knob State Park's {{location}} atop an amphibolite peak {{has made}} it a <b>vitally</b> important and ecologically unique area. Amphibolite is a dark metamorphic rock which is rich in nutrients and supports the growth of rare plants. Elk Knob and Rittle Knob, which {{are now part of}} Elk Knob State Park, are ecologically rich sites that host diverse and rare plant species such as Gray's lily, rattlesnake root, flame azalea, purple fringed orchid and trailing wolfsbane.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in the Salt Lake Valley, the Mormons literally {{had to make a}} place to live. They created irrigation systems, laid out farms, built houses, churches and schools. Access to water was crucially important. Almost immediately, Brigham Young set out to identify and claim additional community sites. While it was difficult to find large areas in the Great Basin where water sources were dependable and growing seasons long enough to raise <b>vitally</b> important subsistence crops, satellite communities began to be formed.|$|E
25|$|Human {{missions}} to Mars will include several transitions between different gravitational environments. These changes will eventually affect the reflex eye movements. A {{key question is}} whether astronauts can have different sets of reflexes among which they can rapidly switch based on the gravitational environment. Determination of the dual-adaptive capabilities of reflex eye movements in such circumstances is <b>vitally</b> important {{so that it can}} be determined to what extent the Sensory-motor coupling skills acquired in one-g environment will transfer to others.|$|E
25|$|That God, in {{the time}} of the {{judgment}} and in accordance with His uniform dealing with the human family in warning them of coming events <b>vitally</b> affecting their destiny (Amos 3:6, 7), sends forth a proclamation of the approach of the Second Advent of Christ; that this work is symbolized by the three angels of Revelation 14, and that their threefold message brings to view a work of reform to prepare a people to meet Him at His coming (Amos 3:6, 7; 2 Corinthians 5:10; Revelation 14:6-12).|$|E
25|$|In his 1865 {{message to}} Congress, the Democratic Johnson {{contended that the}} only {{necessary}} proof of loyalty a state needed to show was ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. Republicans in Congress disagreed; Senator Charles Sumner and Representative Thaddeus Stevens thought black suffrage was <b>vitally</b> necessary to the nation's security and the continuing dominance of the Republican Party. Republicans used parliamentary procedures to ensure none of the Southern delegates, who were mostly former Confederate leaders, took a seat in Congress, and established a predominantly Republican joint committee to decide Reconstruction matters.|$|E
