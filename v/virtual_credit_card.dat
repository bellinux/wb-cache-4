50|$|A <b>virtual</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> (VCC) is a <b>virtual</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> number (VCN) {{typically}} used for online purchases. <b>Virtual</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> numbers {{usually do not}} have physical copies associated and thus cannot be used for in-person point of sale (POS) transactions. Additionally, unlike the numbers generated by online credit card number generators, funds must be deposited into an account associated with the VCN prior to usage.|$|E

Over 1 million payments were made using MB NET in 2009.MB NET allows the creation of <b>virtual</b> <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> to be used online. Depending on the card system, one will get an American Express, VISA or MasterCard virtual card. For example, if the card is a VISA or Visa Electron then the generated cards by MB NET are VISAs.

50|$|To {{generate}} a <b>virtual</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> one must login to the MB NET site and enter a limit. Then the site instantly gives {{the credit card}} number and security codes (CVC2 and CVV2) {{to pay for your}} online purchase. The number is also valid for offline purchases. The virtual cards allow for normal credit card interactions; either payment or crediting the holder's account. There are two types of virtual card—one for one-time use, and one meant for multiple uses.|$|E
25|$|Controlled payment numbers (also {{known as}} <b>virtual</b> <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> or {{disposable}} <b>credit</b> <b>cards)</b> are another option for protecting against <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> fraud where {{presentation of a}} physical card is not required, as in telephone and online purchasing. These are one-time use numbers that function as a payment card and {{are linked to the}} user's real account, but do not reveal details, and cannot be used for subsequent unauthorised transactions. They can be valid for a relatively short time, and limited to the actual amount of the purchase or a limit set by the user. Their use can be limited to one merchant. If the number given to the merchant is compromised, it will be rejected if an attempt is made to use it a second time.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Theft of stored {{credit card}} {{information}} {{is an increasing}} threat to e-commerce. We propose a dynamic <b>virtual</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> number scheme that reduces {{the damage caused by}} stolen credit card numbers. A user can use an existing credit card account to generate multiple <b>virtual</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> numbers that are either usable for a single transaction or are tied with a particular merchant. We call the scheme dynamic because the <b>virtual</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> numbers can be generated without online contact with the credit card issuers. These numbers can be processed without changing any of the infrastructure currently in place; the only changes will be at the end points, namely, the card users and the card issuers. We analyze the security requirements for dynamic <b>virtual</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> numbers, discuss the design space, propose a scheme using HMAC, and prove its security under the assumption that HMAC is a PRF.

The study uses the descriptive and comparative method which results a conclusion that in applying the safety system of online transaction with the verification method using Paypal should be taken from a valid data of a legal credit card. The use of VCC (<b>Virtual</b> <b>Credit</b> <b>Card)</b> for verifying is unsafe {{because all of the}} account data will be known by the third party or the service seller of VCC (<b>Virtual</b> <b>Credit</b> <b>Card).</b> It is happened if the problem in limiting Paypal account occurred which results a temporary blockading account {{and the only way to}} solve it is by contacting the VCC (<b>Virtual</b> <b>Credit</b> <b>Card)</b> center. So this is the case from the study done that they will ask the id number and Paypal password to log in the Paypal user account with the reason to solve the limitation. Giving the id number and password to a third party is the same with letting them to have a blank cheque. Eventhough Paypal has a strong protection system to keep the users data account, the problem will still occur if they use VCC (<b>Virtual</b> <b>Credit</b> <b>Card)</b> ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>cards</b> {{have become}} a {{noticeable}} feature on most American households’ financial landscape. Data from the Bank for International Settlements indicate {{that the number of}} <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> in circulation increased 34 percent between 1988 and 1994, and the number of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> transactions increased 55 percent. The data also show that the value of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> transactions increased 98 percent during the same period. The higher number of cards and their use increased the size of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt, so that total consumer revolving credit outstanding grew from $ 175 billion to $ 339 billion. Unfortunately, aggregate data like those above fail to provide information about the composition of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt growth. So it is impossible to tell whether the increased debt arose from a general {{increase in the number of}} households or from a larger proportion of households with <b>credit</b> <b>cards.</b> Aggregate data also do not reveal who holds <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> balances—upper- or lower-income households—nor do they indicate which factor contributed more to the growth of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt—an increase in the number of households with <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> or an increase in average <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> indebtedness. Such detailed information about the components of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt growth is important because each component has different implications for the viability of the growth of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt. Household data provide some of the information we need to examine the different strata of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt.
