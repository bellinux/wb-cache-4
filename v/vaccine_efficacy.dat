50|$|<b>Vaccine</b> <b>efficacy</b> {{differs from}} vaccine {{effectiveness}} {{in the same}} way that an explanatory clinical trial differs from an intention to treat trial: <b>vaccine</b> <b>efficacy</b> shows how effective the vaccine could be given ideal circumstances and 100% vaccine uptake; vaccine effectiveness measures how well a vaccine performs when it is used in routine circumstances in the community. Since <b>vaccine</b> <b>efficacy</b> is based on a population that are placed in certain controlled environment, this study becomes more effective. If the criteria changed, such as if it was based on a larger population that wasn’t as restricted and in a more natural environment, that would be the vaccines effectiveness. What makes the <b>vaccine</b> <b>efficacy</b> applicable is that it also shows the disease attack rates as well as a tracking of vaccination status. Vaccine effectiveness is a lot more easily tracked than the <b>vaccine</b> <b>efficacy</b> considering the difference in environment; however, the <b>vaccine</b> <b>efficacy</b> is more expensive and very difficult to conduct. Because the trial is based on people who are taking the vaccination and people who aren’t, there is a risk for disease, and optimal treatment is needed for those who become infected. The advantages of a <b>vaccine</b> <b>efficacy</b> have control for all biases that would be found with randomization, as well as prospective, active monitoring for disease attack rates, and careful tracking of vaccination status for a study population there is normally a subset as well, laboratory confirmation of the infectious outcome of interest and a sampling of vaccine immunogenicity. The major disadvantages of <b>vaccine</b> <b>efficacy</b> trials are the complexity and expense of performing them, especially for relatively uncommon infectious outcomes of diseases for which the sample size required is driven up to achieve clinically useful statistical power.|$|E

We constructed a computer simulation model to determine the potential economic value of a VL vaccine in the endemic region of Bihar state, India. Results found a potential vaccine to be cost-effective (and in many cases economically dominant, i. e., saving costs and providing health benefits) throughout a wide range of vaccination costs, <b>vaccine</b> <b>efficacies,</b> and VL risks.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: rEm-TSP 1 and -TSP 3 along with nontoxic CpG ODN (CpG oligodeoxynucleotides) adjuvant were intranasally (i. n.) immunized to BALB/c mice and their <b>vaccine</b> <b>efficacies</b> were evaluated by counting liver CLNR (experiment I). 37. 1 % (p < 0. 05) and 62. 1 % (p < 0. 001) of CLNR were achieved by these two proteins, respectively. To study the protection-associated immune responses induced by rEm-TSP 3 via different immunization routes (i. n. administration with CpG or s. c. immunization with Freund's adjuvant), the systemic and mucosal antibody responses were detected by ELISA (experiment II). S. c. and i. n. administration of rEm-TSP 3 achieved 81. 9 % (p < 0. 001) and 62. 8 % (p < 0. 01) CLNR in the liver, respectively. Both the immunization routes evoked strong serum IgG, IgG 1 and IgG 2 α responses; i. n. immunization induced significantly higher IgA responses in nasal cavity and intestine compared with s. c. immunization (p < 0. 001). Both immunization routes induced extremely strong liver IgA antibody responses (p < 0. 001). The Th 1 and Th 2 cell responses were assessed by examining the IgG 1 /IgG 2 α ratio at two and three weeks post-immunization. S. c. immunization resulted in {{a reduction in the}} IgG 1 /IgG 2 α ratio (Th 1 tendency), whereas i. n. immunization caused a shift from Th 1 to Th 2. Moreover, immunohistochemistry showed that Em-TSP 1 and -TSP 3 were extensively located on the surface of E. multilocularis cysts, protoscoleces and adult worms with additional expression of Em-TSP 3 in the inner part of protoscoleces and oncospheres.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a vaccine can be broadly defined as a practical measure of its costs and benefits when used in a community setting. What then {{is the relationship between}} a <b>vaccine's</b> <b>efficacy</b> and its effectiveness? Effectiveness certainly includes efficacy, but also encompasses secondary effects of vaccination, long-term <b>efficacy</b> of a <b>vaccine</b> (beyond that measured in conventional efficacy trials), the impact of vaccinating against one strain upon cross-reacting infections, costs of vaccination programmes and logistic considerations for vaccine delivery. This paper considers some of the biological determinants of effectiveness namely; secondary effects, long-term efficacy and competitive interactions amongst strains.

If the efficacies do not greatly vary between one- and two-dose schemes, one-dose vaccination may well be supported. Nevertheless, two-dose vaccination is shown to result in less morbidity if the <b>vaccine</b> <b>efficacies</b> are greatly diminished by reducing the dose.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Two current leading malaria blood-stage vaccine {{candidate}} antigens for Plasmodium falciparum, the C-terminal {{region of}} {{merozoite surface protein}} 1 (MSP 1 (19)) and apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA 1), have been prioritized because of outstanding protective efficacies achieved in a rodent malaria Plasmodium yoelii model. However, P. falciparum vaccines based on these antigens have had disappointing outcomes in clinical trials. Discrepancies in the <b>vaccine</b> <b>efficacies</b> observed between the P. yoelii model and human clinical trials still remain problematic. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: In this study, we assessed the protective efficacies {{of a series of}} MSP 1 (19) - and AMA 1 -based vaccines using the P. berghei rodent malarial parasite and its transgenic models. Immunization of mice with a baculoviral-based vaccine (BBV) expressing P. falciparum MSP 1 (19) induced high titers of PfMSP 1 (19) -specific antibodies that strongly reacted with P. falciparum blood-stage parasites. However, no protection was achieved following lethal challenge with transgenic P. berghei expressing PfMSP 1 (19) in place of native PbMSP 1 (19). Similarly, neither P. berghei MSP 1 (19) - nor AMA 1 -BBV was effective against P. berghei. In contrast, immunization with P. yoelii MSP 1 (19) - and AMA 1 -BBVs provided 100 % and 40 % protection, respectively, against P. yoelii lethal challenge. Mice that naturally acquired sterile immunity against P. berghei became cross-resistant to P. yoelii, but not vice versa. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to address blood-stage <b>vaccine</b> <b>efficacies</b> using both P. berghei and P. yoelii models at the same time. P. berghei completely circumvents immune responses induced by MSP 1 (19) - and AMA 1 -based vaccines, suggesting that P. berghei possesses additional molecules and/or mechanisms that circumvent the host's immune responses to MSP 1 (19) and AMA 1, which are lacking in P. yoelii. Although it is not known whether P. falciparum shares these escape mechanisms with P. berghei, P. berghei and its transgenic models may have potential as useful tools for identifying and evaluating new blood-stage vaccine candidate antigens for P. falciparum...|$|R

(The Vollum strain was the same one weaponized by the old U.S. biological warfare program.) As with the Sterne (veterinary) anthrax vaccine strain and the similar British anthrax vaccine (known as AVP), AVA lacks the capsule plasmid pXO2 (required for full virulence) and is composed chiefly of the anthrax protective antigen (PA) with small amounts of edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF) that may vary from lot to lot.
