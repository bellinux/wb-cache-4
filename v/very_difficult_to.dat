5|$|Found {{with almost}} all other rare-earth metals but never by itself, {{lutetium}} is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> separate from other elements. The principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite: (Ce, La, etc.)PO4 which contains 0.0001% of the element. The abundance of lutetium in the Earth crust {{is only about}} 0.5mg/kg. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. The world production of lutetium (in the form of oxide) is about 10 tonnes per year. Pure lutetium metal is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> prepare. It {{is one of the}} rarest and most expensive of the rare earth metals with the price about US$10,000 per kilogram, or about one-fourth that of gold.|$|E
5|$|In any case, {{there was}} not enough artillery, but new pieces could not be brought in. This was because it was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> move them over land, and {{there was not}} enough ice to bring them over the sea.|$|E

5|$|The greater melampitta is {{reported}} to be very shy and wary, but also inquisitive and may approach people sitting quietly to investigate. It is usually revealed by its calls, and can be <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> locate if it is not calling.|$|E

5|$|Uranium hexfluoride is {{a highly}} {{corrosive}} substance. It is an oxidant and a Lewis acid which is able to bind to fluoride. It reacts with water to form a solid compound, and is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> handle on an industrial scale.|$|E

5|$|An oil tanker's {{inert gas}} system {{is one of}} the most {{important}} parts of its design. Fuel oil itself is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> ignite, but its hydrocarbon vapors are explosive when mixed with air in certain concentrations. The purpose of the system is to create an atmosphere inside tanks in which the hydrocarbon oil vapors cannot burn.|$|E
5|$|Barium is a soft, silvery-white metal, with {{a slight}} golden shade when ultrapure. The silvery-white color of barium metal rapidly vanishes upon {{oxidation}} in air yielding a dark gray oxide layer. Barium has a medium specific weight and good electrical conductivity. Ultrapure barium is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> prepare, and therefore many properties of barium have not been accurately measured yet.|$|E
5|$|Bicycles {{have been}} constructed, for {{investigation}} and demonstration purposes, with the steering reversed so that turning the handlebars {{to the left}} causes the front wheel {{to turn to the}} right, and vica versa. It is possible to ride such a bicycle, but it has been found that riders experienced with normal bicycles find it <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> learn, if they can manage it at all.|$|E

50|$|In several places, {{synchronization}} {{with the}} orchestra can be <b>very</b> <b>difficult,</b> due <b>to</b> the orchestral part often being offbeat to the soloist part, therefore demanding numerous rehearsals.|$|R
5|$|Bohr's {{model was}} not perfect. It could only predict the {{spectral}} lines of hydrogen; it couldn't predict those of multielectron atoms. Worse still, as spectrographic technology improved, additional spectral lines in hydrogen were observed which Bohr's model couldn't explain. In 1916, Arnold Sommerfeld added elliptical orbits to the Bohr model {{to explain the}} extra emission lines, but this made the model <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> use, and it still couldn't explain more complex atoms.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{forecast}} in {{its early}} stages as the storm approached the eastern Caribbean. Even though most forecast models predicted that Dean would skirt the Leeward Islands, the track prediction models were not consistent and, as a result, uncertainty existed in justifying the posting of watches and warnings for the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico. One track predicted Dean to threaten South Florida within three to fourdays.|$|E
5|$|Immature American {{white and}} scarlet ibises are <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> tell apart, {{although}} scarlet ibises {{tend to have}} darker legs and bare skin around the face. An immature American white ibis could be mistaken for an immature glossy ibis, but the latter is wholly dark brown and lacks the white belly and rump. The adult is distinguishable from the wood stork, which is much larger and its wings have more black on them.|$|E

5|$|Oil spills have {{devastating effects}} on the environment. Crude oil {{contains}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which are <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> clean up, and last for years in the sediment and marine environment. Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility to disease, and abnormal reproductive cycles.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises, {{as opposed}} to their dolphin counterparts, {{generally}} do not thrive in captivity, and are <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> maintain. The reopened Miyajima Aquarium in Hiroshima (Japan) houses three finless porpoises. In the Vancouver Aquarium (Canada), there is a harbour porpoise on display, Daisy, who beached herself into Horseshoe Bay in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Soil {{contains}} organic material, {{but because}} of the likelihood of contamination by humic acid of more recent origin, it is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> get satisfactory radiocarbon dates.

The Bristol Channel resorts of Wales and the West Country such as Minehead or the cliffs of Exmoor had been very remote {{from other parts of}} England before the advent of the GWR.|$|E
5|$|Wastewater {{networks}} may sustain damage {{similar to}} water supply networks. It is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> exclude ash from the sewerage system. Systems with combined storm water/sewer lines are most at risk. Ash will enter sewer lines {{where there is}} inflow/infiltration by stormwater through illegal connections (e.g., from roof downpipes), cross connections, around manhole covers or through holes and cracks in sewer pipes.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} reports {{in the summer of}} 1944 {{produced}} by Bomber Command's operational research division attempted to explain these differences, starting with problems in the bombsight itself. However, almost all of the reasons ultimately offered were purely operational in nature. These included the fact that the target indicator flares used as a reference covered an area of , that the bombers were dropping salvos of bombs, not a single test bomb, and that the Master Bomber would change the marking point during the process of the raid, making it <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> correlate the bomb craters to the marking.|$|E
