2500|$|The musical <b>versability</b> widened on {{the third}} Dead artist Syndrome album, Happy Hour while still {{retaining}} with Healy's dark humor and gothic rock style. The album begins with the rock song [...] "Y.S.D." [...] ("Young, Sexy and Dead") which is a tragic tribute to the Marilyn Monroe and all others who lived fast and died young. Healy revisits the themes of apostasy and hypocrisy prevalent in Church on [...] "Bride Song". Unlike the gloomy approach of [...] "Red", [...] "Bride Song" [...] addresses the issue with dark humor and likens the church to a snotty, backstabbing woman. The so-called happy portion of the album's title is apparent on the songs [...] "Radiation" [...] and [...] "Glory", both of which feature worship-filled lyrics, as radiation {{is a metaphor for}} the Holy Spirit. Also, Healy experiments with [...] "surf punk" [...] sounds on [...] "U.S.A", which features a [...] "ba ba ba" [...] chorus similar to Ramones' classic [...] "I Want to Be Sedated". The aforementioned [...] "Bride Song" [...] also features an old school punk rock approach, while the title track is a dreamy, guitar-driven instrumental that closes the album.|$|E

50|$|The Bouc-Wen {{model of}} {{hysteresis}} {{is often used}} to describe non-linear hysteretic systems. It was introduced by Bouc and extended by Wen, who demonstrated its versatility by producing a variety of hysteretic patterns. This model is able to capture in analytical form, a range of shapes of hysteretic cycles which match the behaviour of a wide class of hysteretical systems; therefore, given its <b>versability</b> and mathematical tractability, the Bouc-Wen model has quickly gained popularity and has been extended and applied {{to a wide variety of}} engineering problems, including multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems, buildings, frames, bidirectional and torsional response of hysteretic systems two- and three-dimensional continua, and soil liquefaction among others. The Bouc-Wen model and its variants/extensions have been used in applications of structural control, in particular in the modeling of the behaviour of magnetorheological dampers, base isolation devices for buildings and other kinds of damping devices; it has also been used in the modelling and analysis of structures built of reinforced concrete, steel, masonry and timber.|$|E

40|$|The polygon of <b>versability</b> is an {{integral}} part of the entrance examination at the Faculty of Sport and Physical Education in Novi Sad, and the pre-examination obliga- tion connecting the subject The Foundation of Anthropomotoric. The question is: is it the adequate test of the average physical ability or which motor capability has the gre- atest influence to the results of the polygon <b>versability?</b> On the sample of 200 male stu- dents of the first year at the Faculty, 19 years old, the battery of 8 motor tests was used which were taken from the Evrofit protocol, and the results of tests showed the predictor variables. The results of the <b>versability</b> polygon, which were passed by the students as the pre-examination duty, presented criteria variable, to estimate the influence of motor ability to the results of <b>versability</b> polygon. The regression analysis was used to find out the influence of whole motor space, as well as, the influence of every motor test, to the results of <b>versability</b> polygo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The present paper {{deals with}} direct and {{indirect}} calorimetric experiments on smaller terrestrial and aquatic animals {{in the range of}} mg and g wet weight. Especi-ally, the energy metabolism during development and growth, under decrease of oxy-gen concentration (hypoxidanoxia) and with adverse or toxic environmental condi-tions was studied. The results demonstrate the broad <b>versability</b> of direct calorimetry as a sensitive, non-specific and non-invasive method for investigations of living organisms...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{nebulizer}} for microflow {{atmospheric pressure}} chemical ionization mass spectrometry was developed. It {{consisted of a}} tube with analyte-transporting fused silica capillary inside. The terminal part of the tube was resistively heated using a coiled resistance wire. Optimal nebulizer parameters and construction setup were investigated to fully demonstrate its <b>versability.</b> Corundum {{appeared to be a}} more suitable material than quartz for fabrication of the tube nebulizer. The lowest analyte flow rate investigated was 1. 0 Î¼l/min with an excellent signal stability reached...|$|E
40|$|Iterative tomographic {{reconstruction}} {{has significantly}} gained interest {{during the past}} decade, mainly beacuse they have become computationally more feasible. Compared to analytic reconstruction methods such as filtered back projection, its main advantage is in the possibility to incorporate prior knowledge that can steer the reconstruction proces towards high quality images. One type of prior knowledge concerns assumptions about the greylevels representing the object to be scanned. For example, in quality control of 3 D printed objects, the type of material of which the object is composed of is known, but not its exact spatial distribution. Exploiting this prior knowledge into a tomographic reconstruction process often leads to significantly better images. Discrete tomography focusses {{on the problem of}} reconstruction of images that are represnted by a (very) small number of greylevels, starting from a small number of acquired projections. Many methods exist to enforce such prior knowledge. In this talk, we will shortly explain the principles of some of these algorithms. Next, we will focus on specific applications (in medical CT, electron microscopy, video processing, the world of art, etc) to demonstrate the <b>versability</b> of this technique...|$|E
