5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are nonlinear partial {{differential equations}} and, as such, difficult to solve exactly. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} exact solutions are known, although only a few have direct physical applications. The best-known exact solutions, and also those most interesting from a physics point of <b>view,</b> <b>are</b> the Schwarzschild solution, the Reissner–Nordström solution and the Kerr metric, each corresponding to {{a certain type of}} black hole in an otherwise empty universe, and the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker and de Sitter universes, each describing an expanding cosmos. Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the Gödel universe (which opens up the intriguing possibility of time travel in curved spacetimes), the Taub-NUT solution (a model universe that is homogeneous, but anisotropic), and anti-de Sitter space (which has recently come to prominence in the context of what is called the Maldacena conjecture).|$|E

This chapel is known to have existed in this form at least since the 19th century. The monastery has an archive which dates back to the year 1600, which mostly records baptisms, confirmations, marriages and deaths of the local population. During the Mexican Revolution, this archive was sealed behind a wall in order to avoid its destruction.|$|E

Escherichia coli is a badly classified species as some strains share only 20% of their genome. Being so diverse it should be given a higher taxonomic ranking. However, due to the medical conditions associated with the species, it will not be changed to avoid confusion in medical context.|$|E
25|$|In {{the theory}} of Galois cohomology of {{algebraic}} groups, some further points of <b>view</b> <b>are</b> introduced. They have explanatory value, in particular in relation with {{the theory of}} quadratic forms; but were {{for the most part}} post hoc, as far as the discovery of the phenomena is concerned. The first point is that quadratic forms over a field can be identified as a Galois , or twisted forms (torsors) of an orthogonal group. As an algebraic group, an orthogonal group is in general neither connected nor simply-connected; the latter point brings in the spin phenomena, while the former is related to the discriminant.|$|E

40|$|Multiview {{clustering}} algorithms allow leveraging {{information from}} multiple {{views of the}} data and therefore lead to improved clustering. A number of kernel based multiview clustering algorithms work by using the kernel matrices defined on the different views of the data. However, these algorithms assume availability of features from all the views of each example, i. e., assume that the kernel matrix for each <b>view</b> <b>is</b> complete. We present an approach that allows these algorithms to be applicable even when only one (the primary) <b>view</b> <b>is</b> complete and the auxiliary <b>views</b> <b>are</b> incomplete (i. e., features from these <b>views</b> <b>are</b> available only {{for some of the}} examples). Taking the kernel CCA based multiview clustering as an example, we apply our method on webpage clustering with multiple views of the data where one <b>view</b> <b>is</b> the page-text and other <b>view</b> <b>is</b> the social tags assigned to the webpage. We consider the case when the tags are available only for a small subset of the webpages which means that the tag <b>view</b> <b>is</b> incomplete. Experimental results establish the effectiveness of the proposed method. ...|$|R

25|$|Street View is {{available}} {{as a component of}} Google Maps, as a web application, and as a mobile application for Android and iOS. Originally, Google Maps used Adobe Flash for Street View. Google overhauled Google Maps in 2013. The newer version uses JavaScript extensively and provides a JavaScript application programming interface. At the time of their release, the new Google Maps and Street <b>View</b> <b>are</b> measured slower than the old version in various setups. A user can switch to the old version of Google Maps, which is especially useful when Google Maps is more sluggish than usual.|$|E
25|$|If {{the linear}} map f is {{represented}} by the matrix A with respect to two bases of V and W, then f {{is represented by}} the transpose matrix AT with respect to the dual bases of W and V, hence the name. Alternatively, as f is represented by A acting on the left on column vectors, f {{is represented by the}} same matrix acting on the right on row vectors. These points of <b>view</b> <b>are</b> related by the canonical inner product on Rn, which identifies the space of column vectors with the dual space of row vectors.|$|E

25|$|Historicism is {{a method}} of {{interpretation}} in Christian eschatology which interprets biblical prophecies as actual historical events and identifies symbolic beings with historical persons or societies {{in the history of}} the church. This interpretation was favored by the Protestant reformers such as John Wycliff and Martin Luther, as well as other prominent figures such as Isaac Newton. Modern theological proponents of this <b>view</b> <b>are</b> further convinced by the perceived resemblances of liturgical practices and ordinances to the Akkadian religious system and those evolved from it. One such example is the miter's comparison to the dead fish as a traditional vestment of the head priests who served the god of the sea, specifically fishing, and of fertility: Dagon.|$|E
25|$|There is {{one final}} matter to consider: the {{possibility}} that euthanasia not only would be performed on incompetent patients {{in violation of the}} rules—as an abuse of the safeguards—but would become the rule in the context of demographic and budgetary pressures on Social Security and Medicare as the Baby Boom generation begins to retire, around 2010. Once legalized, physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia would become routine. Over time doctors would become comfortable giving injections to end life and Americans would become comfortable having euthanasia as an option. Comfort would make us want to extend the option to others who, in society's <b>view,</b> <b>are</b> suffering and leading purposeless lives. The ethical arguments for physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia, advocates of euthanasia have maintained, do not apply to euthanasia only when it is voluntary; they {{can also be used to}} justify some kinds of nonvoluntary euthanasia of the incompetent.|$|E
25|$|A pure SR {{analysis}} {{would be}} as follows: Analyzed in Stella's rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip. When she fires her rockets for the turnaround, she experiences a pseudo force which resembles a gravitational force. Figs.2‑6 and 2‑11 illustrate the concept of lines (planes) of simultaneity: Lines parallel to the observer's x-axis (xy-plane) represent sets of events that are simultaneous in the observer frame. In Fig.2‑11, the blue lines connect events on Terence's world line which, from Stella's point of <b>view,</b> <b>are</b> simultaneous with events on her world line. (Terence, in turn, would observe a set of horizontal lines of simultaneity.) Throughout both the outbound and the inbound legs of Stella's journey, she measures Terence's clocks as running slower than her own. But during the turnaround (i.e. between the bold blue lines in the figure), a shift {{takes place in the}} angle of her lines of simultaneity, corresponding to a rapid skip-over of the events in Terence's world line that Stella considers to be simultaneous with her own. Therefore, {{at the end of her}} trip, Stella finds that Terence has aged more than she has.|$|E
