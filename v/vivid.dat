5|$|Testaroli {{have been}} celebrated by Lunigiana-born Col. Primo Tomellini with a vibrant and <b>vivid</b> poetry.|$|E
5|$|Selbornes {{reception}} {{in the two}} hundred years since its initial publication oﬀers a <b>vivid</b> instance of the retrospective idealization that transforms history into heritage.|$|E
5|$|Villani also {{describes}} in <b>vivid</b> detail {{the effects of}} another widespread famine in Tuscany during the year 1347, which killed an estimated 4,000 people in Florence {{a year before the}} Bubonic Plague.|$|E
5|$|An aria for soprano II and obbligato violin {{express the}} praise and adoration of God in <b>vivid</b> coloraturas. It {{has been argued}} that Bach might have thought of the Dresden taste and the {{specific}} voice of Faustina Bordoni.|$|E
5|$|Another case of synesthesia is {{swimming}}-style synesthesia {{in which}} each swimming style {{is associated with a}} <b>vivid</b> experience of a color. These synesthetes do not need to perform the actual movements of a corresponding swimming style. To activate the concurrent experiences, it is sufficient to activate the concept of a swimming style (e.g., by presenting a photograph of a swimmer or simply talking about swimming).|$|E
5|$|Busch biographer Joseph Kraus divided {{his work}} into three periods. He points out, however, that this {{classification}} is a simplification, as some works by their nature {{can be of}} a later or earlier period. All three periods show Busch's obsession with German middle class life. His peasants are devoid of sensitivity and village life {{is marked by a}} <b>vivid</b> lack of sentiment.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the novel}} emphasises Brooke's {{sexuality}} and his understanding of love. Additionally, the novel contrasts the various elements of English upper- and lower-class life during the Edwardian period. Other notable elements {{of the novel}} include the <b>vivid</b> descriptions of the life in Grantchester and the borrowing of themes from Brooke's poetry such as beekeeping.|$|E
5|$|Neolithic cave {{paintings}} do {{not have}} traces of green pigments, but neolithic peoples in northern Europe did make a green dye for clothing, made from {{the leaves of the}} birch tree. it was of very poor quality, more brown than green. Ceramics from ancient Mesopotamia show people wearing <b>vivid</b> green costumes, but it is not known how the colors were produced.|$|E
5|$|Snakes {{have been}} {{part and parcel of}} culture and religion. <b>Vivid</b> scale {{patterns}} have been thought to have influenced early art. The use of snake-skin in manufacture of purses, apparel and other articles led to large-scale killing of snakes, giving rise to advocacy for use of artificial snake-skin. Snake scales are also to be found as motifs in fiction, art and films.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh painted {{several groups}} of still lifes in 1885. During his two-year stay in Nuenen, he {{completed}} numerous drawings and watercolours, and nearly 200 oil paintings. His palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones, particularly dark brown, and {{showed no sign}} of the <b>vivid</b> colours that distinguish his later work.|$|E
5|$|When {{he views}} the body, Frank gets various <b>vivid</b> {{visions of the}} crime. His {{knowledge}} of various details unknown to the others unsettles Bletcher. Frank and a fellow member of the Millennium Group named Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) officially join the investigation.|$|E
5|$|According to the 9th-century Book of Roads and Kingdoms by ibn Khordadbeh, China was a {{destination}} for Radhanite Jews buying boys, female slaves and eunuchs from Europe. During the subsequent Song period {{there was also a}} community of Kaifeng Jews in China. The Spaniard, Benjamin of Tudela (from Navarre) was a 12th century Jewish traveler whose Travels of Benjamin recorded <b>vivid</b> descriptions of Europe, Asia, and Africa, preceding those of Marco Polo by a hundred years.|$|E
5|$|According to the Internet Adult Film Database, as of May 2010 Samson had {{appeared}} in 90 adult movies, including compilations containing recycled scenes. A 2006 article in The New York Times reported that she earns from $20,000 to over $100,000 per film, depending on sales, with each one taking from three days to two weeks to make. An Adult Video News article written in February 2006 stated that Samson had five years left on her contract with <b>Vivid.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to {{the disputed}} {{statements}} of the ancient writers and some modern scholars, in Athens Aspasia became a hetaera and probably ran a brothel. Hetaerae were professional high-class entertainers, as well as courtesans. Besides displaying physical beauty, they differed from most Athenian women in being educated (often to a high standard, as in Aspasia's case), having independence, and paying taxes. They were the nearest thing perhaps to liberated women; and Aspasia, who became a <b>vivid</b> figure in Athenian society, was probably an obvious example. According to Plutarch, Aspasia was compared to the famous Thargelia, another renowned Ionian hetaera of ancient times.|$|E
5|$|Although the story's {{central theme}} is loneliness, it uses shoes and rain as motifs, along with Man'yōshū poetry and the Japanese garden {{in which it}} is set. Although rain is {{typically}} seen as sad and gloomy, in The Garden of Words it makes the world more <b>vivid</b> and protects the two main characters from the reality of their lives and the limitations imposed by society. Shinkai also noted a parallel between love and rain—that neither can be controlled or stopped.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the works}} created {{during the war}} was Yakov Knyazhnin's tragedy Olga (1772). The Russian playwright chose to {{introduce}} Sviatoslav as his protagonist, although his active participation in the events following Igor's death is {{out of sync with}} the traditional chronology. Knyazhnin's rival Nikolai Nikolev (1758–1815) also wrote a play on the subject of Sviatoslav's life. Ivan Akimov's painting Sviatoslav's Return from the Danube to Kiev (1773) explores the conflict between military honour and family attachment. It is a <b>vivid</b> example of Poussinesque rendering of early medieval subject matter.|$|E
5|$|As an {{illiterate}} child, she {{had been}} told Bible stories by her mother. The particular variety of her early Christian belief remains unclear, but she acquired a passionate faith in God. She rejected {{the teachings of the}} New Testament that urged slaves to be obedient and found guidance in the Old Testament tales of deliverance. Tubman was devout, and when she began experiencing visions and <b>vivid</b> dreams, she interpreted them as revelations from God. This religious perspective informed her actions throughout her life.|$|E
5|$|At {{a science}} museum {{the family is}} visiting, Bart runs into Ralph Wiggum, {{who is in the}} process of being pushed into a giant ear by Kearney, Jimbo, Nelson, and Dolph. When Ralph is freed by a museum employee, Marge and Chief Wiggum are there to meet him. Marge observes that Ralph has a <b>vivid</b> {{imagination}} and learns that he has no friends to play with; she arranges a play-date for Ralph to spend time with a horrified Bart.|$|E
5|$|Born a slave in Dorchester County, Maryland, Tubman {{was beaten}} and whipped by her various masters as a child. Early in life, she {{suffered}} a traumatic head wound when an irate slave owner threw a heavy metal weight intending to hit another slave and hit her instead. The injury caused dizziness, pain, and spells of hypersomnia, which occurred throughout her life. She was a devout Christian and experienced strange visions and <b>vivid</b> dreams, which she ascribed to premonitions from God.|$|E
5|$|Central Saint Giles is a mixed-use {{development}} in central London. Built {{at a cost}} of £450million and completed in May 2010, it was designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano and is his first work in the UK. The development consists of two buildings of up to 15 storeys in height, arranged around a public courtyard lined with shops and restaurants. It is chiefly notable for its façades, covered with 134,000 glazed tiles in <b>vivid</b> shades of green, orange, lime and yellow. It has attracted a number of high-profile tenants including NBCUniversal, MindShare and Google.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by {{his work as a}} {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet <b>vivid</b> descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Van Gogh {{mastered}} {{the use of}} light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees {{as if they are}} the source of light – almost in a sacred manner. Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including View of Arles, Flowering Orchards. Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. In the <b>vivid</b> light of the Mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, {{a family}} {{sit down to}} dinner together, before spontaneously {{collapsing}} and bleeding profusely; further victims of the virus. At home, Black learns that his daughter has been having <b>vivid</b> nightmares {{about the end of}} the world, in which she and her parents are isolated in a woodland cabin. Black admits to his wife that he has come to accept the Group as a cult, and wishes to leave. He arranges to see a doctor, wishing to be tested but wanting the results to remain secret.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Filitti, {{who kept}} a <b>vivid</b> {{interest}} in Romanian Orthodox history, published Biserici și ctitori ("Churches and Ktitors"). He was preoccupied with similar thoughts {{when he decided}} to sponsor the rebuilding and refurbishing of two ancestral churches: the Dormition Church in Slatina, originally built by his Slătineanu relatives (whom he commemorated with a coat of arms, displayed over the church entrance); and the Sfântul Dumitru de Jurământ Metochion of Constandie Filitti (whom he had reburied on church premises).|$|E
5|$|In January 1919, Collingwood was {{transferred}} to Devonport and assigned to the Reserve Fleet. Upon {{the dissolution of the}} Grand Fleet on 18 March, the Reserve Fleet was renamed the Third Fleet and Collingwood became its flagship. She became a tender to HMS <b>Vivid</b> on 1 October and served as a gunnery and wireless telegraphy training ship until early August 1920, when the ship returned to the reserve. Collingwood served as a boys' training ship on 22 September 1921 until she was paid off on 31 March 1922. Collingwood was sold for scrap on 12 December and was broken up.|$|E
5|$|In late 1907 the Knights {{moved to}} Cornwall, staying first in Newlyn, {{before moving to}} the nearby village of Lamorna. There, {{alongside}} Lamorna Birch and Alfred Munnings, they became central figures in the artists colony known as the Newlyn School. By March 1908 both had work exhibited at the Newlyn Art Gallery and Harold Knight was an established professional portrait painter, while Laura Knight was still developing her art. Around Newlyn the Knights found themselves among a group of sociable and energetic artists, which appears to have allowed the more <b>vivid</b> and dynamic aspects of Laura's personality to come to the fore.|$|E
5|$|Like other Japanese anime, The Garden of Words {{was created}} using a {{combination}} of hand-drawn animation, rotoscoping and computer animation (CGI), with the latter facilitating the realistic appearance of the film's rain sequences. Shinkai made half of the film's backgrounds by using his photographs as a base and then drawing over the top with Adobe Photoshop, while the other half were fictional settings created with traditional animation and computer graphics. As with his other films, the backgrounds are <b>vivid</b> and meticulously drawn scenery while the characters are drawn with less detail, though they are still convincing and realistic.|$|E
5|$|Mickiewicz's {{childhood}} environment exerted a {{major influence}} on his literary work. His early years were shaped by immersion in Belarusian folklore and by <b>vivid</b> memories, which he later reworked in his poems, of the ruins of Navahrudak Castle and of the triumphant entry and disastrous retreat of Polish and Napoleonic troops during Napoleon's 1812 invasion of Russia. The year 1812 also marked his father's death. Later, the poet's personality and subsequent works were greatly influenced by his four years of living and studying in Vilnius.|$|E
5|$|Olivia Mary Manning CBE (2 March 1908– 23 July 1980) was a British novelist, poet, {{writer and}} reviewer. Her fiction and non-fiction, {{frequently}} detailing journeys and personal odysseys, were principally set in England, Ireland, Europe and the Middle East. She often wrote from her personal experience, though her books also demonstrate strengths in imaginative writing. Her books are widely admired for her artistic eye and <b>vivid</b> descriptions of place.|$|E
5|$|Portrait of a Lady (or Portrait of a Woman) {{is a small}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} executed around 1460 by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. The {{composition is}} built from the geometric shapes that form {{the lines of the}} woman's veil, neckline, face, and arms, and by the fall of the light that illuminates her face and headdress. The <b>vivid</b> contrasts of darkness and light enhance the almost unnatural beauty and Gothic elegance of the model.|$|E
5|$|Savanna Samson (born October 14, 1967) is {{the stage}} name of Natalie Oliveros, an American former pornographic actress. The winner of several AVN Awards, {{she has spent}} most of her career as a {{contract}} performer with major producer <b>Vivid</b> Entertainment, and is known for her roles in acclaimed adult films such as The New Devil in Miss Jones. In addition to performing, she has her own adult film studio, Savanna Samson Productions. A native of upstate New York, she entered the adult film industry in 2000, after working as a dancer at the Manhattan strip club, Scores.|$|E
5|$|Scales play an {{important}} part in the natural history of Lepidoptera. Scales enable the development of <b>vivid</b> or indistinct patterns which help the organism protect itself by camouflage, mimicry and warning. Besides providing insulation, dark patterns on wings allow sunlight to be absorbed and are probably involved in thermoregulation. Bright and distinctive colour patterns in butterflies which are distasteful to predators help communicate their toxicity or inedibility, thus preventing predation. In Batesian mimicry, wing colour patterns help edible lepidopterans mimic inedible models, while in Müllerian mimicry, inedible butterflies resemble each other to reduce the numbers of individuals sampled by inexperienced predators.|$|E
5|$|Shen Kuo wrote {{several other}} books besides the Dream Pool Essays, yet {{much of the}} writing in his other books has not survived. Some of Shen's poetry was {{preserved}} in posthumous written works. Although much of his focus was on technical and scientific issues, he {{had an interest in}} divination and the supernatural, the latter including his <b>vivid</b> description of unidentified flying objects from eyewitness testimony. He also wrote commentary on ancient Daoist and Confucian texts.|$|E
5|$|Sir Hugh Seymour Walpole, CBE (13 March 18841 June 1941) was an English novelist. He {{was the son}} of an Anglican clergyman, {{intended}} for a career in the church but drawn instead to writing. Among those who encouraged him were the authors Henry James and Arnold Bennett. His skill at scene-setting and <b>vivid</b> plots, as well as his high profile as a lecturer, brought him a large readership in the United Kingdom and North America. He was a best-selling author in the 1920s and 1930s but has been largely neglected since his death.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxons {{produced}} extensive {{poetry in}} Old English, {{some of which}} was written down {{as early as the}} 9th century, although most surviving poems were compiled in the 10th and early 11th century. Beowulf, probably written between 650 and 750, is typical of these poems, portraying a <b>vivid,</b> heroic tale, ending with the protagonist's death {{at the hands of a}} dragon, but still showing signs of the new Christian influences in England. Old English was also used for academic and courtly writing from the 9th century onwards, including translations of popular foreign works, including The Pastoral Care.|$|E
