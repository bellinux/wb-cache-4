40|$|Direct drive motors {{are used}} as {{actuators}} in numerous applications in which they must rotate at low speeds with high torque and low torque ripple. Various types of vernier motors have been studied recently. The HB type <b>vernier</b> <b>motor</b> is one of them. Its rotor structure {{is the same as}} in a HB type stepping motor but has a field winding at the rotor and has multiphase windings in the stator. In the present work, a Matlab simulation of a HB type <b>vernier</b> <b>motor</b> is presented. To validate the motor results and response, the authors fabricated the motor and implemented its drive circuit. The motor was tested for different load conditions. Experimental results are found identical to simulation results and it is also shown that the motor has low torque ripple...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the core design of a PM vernier machine {{considering}} modulation flux effects, and the comparative investigation on volume and performance characteristics of the vernier over conventional PM machines are addressed. To these ends, for a PM vernier machine in operation at the base-speed, the flux density equations for teeth and yokes considering the flux modulation effects are derived, where the air gap harmonic permeance function is used. Using the derived equations, a PM <b>vernier</b> <b>motor</b> with specified yoke flux densities is designed. To identify the predicted flux yoke densities, the flux distribution and iron losses in core parts are analyzed through time-step finite element (FE) simulations. Through Fourier series expansion of the air gap flux waves obtained by FE analysis at several specified times, the harmonic components constituting the flux waves are investigated and their speeds are also evaluated in numerical ways. Finally, to estimate the competitiveness of vernier machines versus conventional machines, the designed PM <b>vernier</b> <b>motor</b> is compared against two different conventional PM motors designed through the same design procedures in various aspects such as volume, torque capacity, efficiency, and power factor, in which, in particular, the core losses are included in efficiency calculation...|$|E

The key is to newly introduce HTS bulks to flux-modulation poles that can effectively modulate between the high-speed rotating field of armature windings and the low-speed rotating field of the PM outer rotor. Also, the use of HTS bulks can greatly reduce the flux leakage and hence improve the torque density. Based on using the finite element method, the motor performances are analysed.

Both the four-stage Juno I and three-stage Jupiter-C launch vehicles were the same height (21.2 meters), with the added fourth-stage booster of the Juno I being enclosed inside the nose cone of the third stage.|$|R
40|$|The permanent-magnet in-wheel motors {{are very}} {{promising}} {{candidates for the}} propulsion of electric vehicles. In particular, the <b>vernier</b> hybrid <b>motor</b> configuration is convenient from the assembling viewpoint, since both windings and permanent magnets are on the stator.

40|$|Abstract –A {{survey of}} mainly outer rotor {{permanent}} magnet (PM) motors, {{suitable for a}} patented sensor technology sensing the leakage field from the permanent magnets, is performed with a specified target of high torque density. One motor, known to yield high torque density {{is used as a}} reference motor; an electric bike transverse flux motor. Its simulated and measured results are compared with other PM motors such as the axial flux motor, the <b>Vernier</b> <b>motor</b> and flux switching motors. Academic, simulated designs as well as industry developed and manufactured designs are considered. It is found that the reference motor is coming out as a good choice for motors with similar weight and size. Those outer rotor motors that have higher torque density than the reference motor are larger than the reference motor and/or need liquid cooling...|$|E
40|$|Permanent-magnet vernier {{machines}} (PMVMs) {{have attracted}} much attention for their high efficiency and output torque in low-speed application. However, the conventional PMVM suffers from the problems of low power factor and high cogging torque. In this paper, a double-stator flux-focusing split-pole permanent-magnet vernier machine (SP-PMVM) with low cogging torque and high power factor has been proposed. The split-pole topology in the <b>vernier</b> <b>motor</b> has been used mainly to modulate the magnetic flux in this paper, although the stator teeth are {{used for this purpose}} in some cases. The newly-proposed SP-PMVM topology is characterized by reduced flux leakage through using a flux-focusing topology and staggering approximately half of the pitch angularly between the inner stator and outer stator. Firstly, the vernier principle of the proposed SP-PMVM has been investigated by analytical methods. Secondly, a 12 -slot-stator and 22 -pole-pair-rotor SP-PMVM has been optimized with the goal of maximum average steady-state torque and the minimum cogging torque and ripple. Thirdly, the overall performance of the newly-proposed SP-PMVM has been analyzed as compared with the conventional PMVM. The results verify that the SP-PMVM can provide higher power factor, higher output torque and lower cogging torque than that of the conventional PMVM in low-speed application...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{maximize}} their performances, it is profitable to supply <b>vernier</b> reluctance <b>motors</b> (VRMs or Switched Reluctance Motors) with square wave current, but the converter has to switch this current successively into each inductive phase. This raises problems at high speeds. To obtain a high bas speed, therefore a high power, we propose to optimize pole arcs witch have a highly significant importance on the permeance wave of VRMs. The variation {{range of the}} angles is restricted by certain conditions, but within these limits optimization is possible. All dimensional parameters were taken into account and used to calculate average torque in linear {{as well as in}} saturated mode. We neglected the influence of mutual coupling between phases and this hypothesis was justified by results obtained through measurements. Though we used a model with linearized segments to minimize the number of parameters, the same method can be applied to other more accurate models. A VRM with 6 - 4 structure was designed and realized; it allowed validation of our theoritical model...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method to find available slot–pole {{combination of a}} permanent magnet (PM) <b>vernier</b> <b>motor</b> with fractional-slot concentrated winding (FSCW) configurations instead of the conventional design rule. To this aim, for a common structure of PM vernier machines with FSCW, the air gap flux densities including modulation flux due to vernier effects are investigated from the magnetic view points and then a general condition to effectively use the modulation flux is derived. Under the obtained condition, the specific design condition for slot–pole combinations are established for the most popular FSCW configurations with the coil spans of ± 2 π/ 3. Using the established condition, all available vernier structures including those {{which could not be}} found by the previous rule are obtained, and the back-electromotive force (EMF) of each structure is analytically estimated to check the vernier effects. During these procedures, it is also revealed that some of general FSCW-PM motors possess vernier effects and thus can be classified into vernier motors. To verify the proposed ideas, the characteristics of back EMF are analyzed through finite element (FE) -simulations for various models, and compared with their analytical calculation results. Finally, the characteristics of torque regarding to slot–pole combinations of the vernier motors are discussed...|$|E
