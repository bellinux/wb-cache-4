500|$|This {{agreement}} {{laid the}} foundations for the upcoming tank plant at the industrial polygon of Las Canteras, {{near the town of}} Alcalá de Guadaíra. [...] Several parts of the tank were subcontracted to other Spanish companies, including Astilleros Españoles (turret), Boetticher, Duro Felguera and E. N. Bazán. [...] The grade of local production varied per batch. [...] The first 20 tanks were to have 18% of each <b>vehicle</b> <b>manufactured</b> in Spain; the next 40 would have 40% of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>manufactured</b> in Spain. [...] The other 120 had 65% of the tank manufactured in the country. [...] Production began in 1974, at a rate of five tanks per month, and ended on 25 June 1979. [...] The first five tanks were delivered to the Uad Ras Mechanized Infantry Regiment on 30 October 1974. [...] This batch also replaced the M41 Walker Bulldog light tanks and M48 Patton tanks in the Armored Cavalry Regiment Villaviciosa and the Armored Infantry Regiment Alcázar de Toledo, receiving 23 and 44 tanks, respectively.|$|E
30|$|Since it {{is noted}} that the amount of {{combustible}} materials in vehicles has changed over time, a vehicle age analysis for the 41 experiments is carried out. The data collated in this paper includes passenger <b>vehicles</b> <b>manufactured</b> of a span of 40  years however not all of the references provided the exact year of <b>vehicle</b> <b>manufacture</b> thus the experiments were divided into three age categories; experiments with the known year of vehicle manufacture; experiments with the known decade of <b>vehicle</b> <b>manufacture</b> and experiments with an estimated decade of <b>vehicle</b> <b>manufacture</b> based on the date of experiment, date of submission or publication of the source reference. Clearly the third age category introduces more uncertainty to the year of <b>vehicle</b> <b>manufacture</b> than the other two age categories.|$|R

50|$|At its inception, {{the program}} {{required}} light duty vehicles under 4,500 kg (cars, SUV, light trucks) that were {{over three years}} old to have an emissions test completed every two years (<b>vehicles</b> <b>manufactured</b> on even years are tested on odd years and <b>vehicles</b> <b>manufactured</b> on odd years are tested on even years) before the vehicle's owner or lessor can renew their licence plate. <b>Vehicles</b> that were <b>manufactured</b> {{up to and including}} 1988 are exempt as new vehicle emissions standards were coming into effect beginning in 1989.
