40|$|BackgroundPathological {{angiogenesis}} in {{the retina}} {{is the cause}} of many human diseases, including retinopathy of prematurity and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the abnormal proliferation of blood <b>vessel</b> <b>observed</b> in these blinding pathologies appears to be essential to develop potential therapeutic drugs against new molecular targets. Growing evidence has shown that Wnt/Frizzled (Fzd) are directly involved in vascular development. Recently, we have evidenced that Fzd 7 receptor is required for postnatal angiogenesis of retina by controlling endothelial cells (EC) proliferation and migration through a β-catenin canonical pathway. This study aimed to investigate the role of Fzd 7 during aberrant angiogenesis in a model of ischemic retinopathy. Methods/FindingsWe used mice model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) to explore the involvement of Fzd 7 during initial vaso-obliteration (VO) and subsequent neovascularization (NV) phases. First we observed Fzd 7 was expressed in pathologic neovessels. Second, by transgenic approaches, we observed that specific deletion of fzd 7 in the endothelium (fzd 7 ECKO) resulted in increased retinal tissue sensitivity to hypoxia during the vaso-obliterative phase of the OIR model. Moreover, fzd 7 deletion in EC reduced the ectopic growth of pathologic neovessels into the vitreous during {{the second phase of the}} OIR model demonstrating that Fzd 7 was involved in pathological NV formation in mice retina after ischemia. To determine the molecular mechanisms by which Fzd 7 may regulate ischemic retinopathy, we explore canonical β-catenin and Notch signaling during the two different phases of OIR. Preliminary results showed that transcript expressions of β-catenin (lef 1, axin 2) and partners of Notch signaling were strongly decreased in fzd 7 ECKO retina mice as compared to control. ConclusionBy controlling pathogenesis of ischemic retinopathy, Fzd 7 could be an efficient and specific target to develop anti-angiogenic drugs in the treatment of ischemic retinopathies...|$|E

40|$|Marine {{and coastal}} tourism has rapidly {{expanded}} worldwide {{in the past}} 2 decades, often occurring in once secluded habitats. In Alaska, tourism near tidewater glaciers has attracted millions of visitors and increased the presence of ships, tour vessels, and coastal development. Although sustainable tourism, resulting from balanced effects on wildlife and client satisfaction, is a goal of most tourism operators, {{it is not always}} achieved. Voluntary compliance with viewing guidelines and codes of conduct have been encouraged, but few assessments have the longitudinal scope to evaluate long-term changes in impacts on wildlife and the ability of vessel operators and kayak guides to sustain lower impact operating practices over time. This study assessed vessel and kayak visitation and resulting impacts on harbor seals in the Kenai Fjords National Park, southcentral Alaska. We obtained observations from 2002 to 2011, using remotely controlled video cameras located near Aialik and Pedersen Glaciers in the Kenai Fjords National Park. Overall, disturbance was associated with 5. 1 % of vessel sightings, 28 % of vessel interactions (<b>vessel</b> <b>observed</b> within approx. 300 m of seals), 11. 5 % of kayak sightings, and 61 % of kayak interactions. Results demonstrated that voluntary changes in operations significantly reduced vessel and kayak disturbance of seals by 60 – 80 %. Even with prior establishment of operating guidelines, tour vessel captains were able to further reduce their effect on wildlife with more careful operations. Rapid growth of guided kayak excursions that occurred during this study caused greater disturbance to seals than motorized vessels but guide trainings helped reduce disturbances. Diminished impacts of motor vessels and kayakers persisted across years although effects of kayaks were less consistent than motor vessels, which reflected greater variability in inter-annual spatial use patterns by kayakers. Long-term monitoring, including assessments of wildlife responses to vessel and kayak operations, combined with 2 -way communication with vessel operators and guides, enhanced the effectiveness of mitigation and facilitated adaptive adjustments to mitigation protocols over time...|$|E

40|$|The term "ergot" is {{generally}} {{used to describe}} species of the fungus Claviceps, the sclerotia formed by the fungi specifically Claviceps purpurea and {{the wide range of}} unique alkaloids produced by the fungi following infestation of grain. In the Middle Ages, contaminated grain caused plagues of ergotism characterized by gangrene and an intense peripheral burning pain (known as "St. Anthony's fire"), spontaneous abortion and occasional episodes of mania and hallucinations. Initially used therapeutically by European midwives to hasten labor (with many untoward effects), ergot derivatives eventually found a life-saving role in the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. Ergotamine was first used in the treatment of acute migraine in 1926. Common adverse effects of ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (DHE) are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, peripheral paresthesia, swollen fingers, generalized weakness, and peripheral and coronary vasoconstriction. The drugs are contraindicated in people with peripheral vascular disorders, coronary artery disease, stroke, severe hypertension, pregnancy, hepatic or renal failure, or sepsis. Caffeine has been consumed by humans for hundreds if not thousands of years. Throughout the world, the preferred mode for consuming caffeine occurs in markedly different forms (e. g., drinking coffee, tea, mate, soft drinks; chewing cola nuts; consuming coca and guarana products). Caffeine tends to produce a pattern of subjective effects that varies as a function of dose. Although low doses, in the range of 200 to 290 mg. generally produce mild positive subjective effects (e. g., increased feeling of well-being, alertness, energy), higher doses, in the range of 200 to 800 mg. can produce negative effects (e. g., nervousness, anxiety). There are many papers describing the physiology, pharmacology and phannacokinetics of ergotamine, but there is not much data available on the histopathology and haematology of these drugs. The aim {{of the present study was}} the histopathological, haematological and microbiological evaluation of ergotamine and caffeine in a male albino rat model. Following points summarize the study; 1 Male albino rats were employed in this study as animal model and three different drug dosages of ergotamine and caffeine were orally administrated. Prior to administration of drugs, the tissues (liver, heart and kidney), blood and fecal samples of normal healthy animals were studied for haematological and microbiological parameters. 2 Besides, acute dosages of these drugs were administered to animals, so as to evaluate the histopathological and haematological effects of the acute/over dosage. 3 On expiration of the test period, animals were first bled and then dissected for the tissues. 4 The blood was used for the haematological and microbiological evaluation and the findings were compared with that of un-treated normal animals (control). 5 The tissues were processed for histopathological evaluation and the sections were observed for any abnormalities within. 6 In the animals administered with acute doses of the drugs it was found that, there was slight increase in Total Leukocytes Count (TLC) and there was a decrease in the RBC and hemoglobin where as, for other doses, very slight change on haematological parameters was observed. 7 The albino rats treated with various doses indicated that with higher dose of ergotamine severe damage to the liver was caused. At 0. 03 mg/ 0. 5 ml dose the liver showed changes but still the architectural condition was identifiable, but at higher dose prominent changes in hepatocytes, central veins and portal tract area occurred. At a highest dose (1. 25 mg/ 3 ml), the changes were very severe and normal pattern of hepatocytes and architecture of the liver tissue was totally lost. 8 When treated with a dose of 0. 03 mg/ 0. 5 ml of ergotamine heart was severely affected. The histological sections revealed shrinkage of muscles leaving large cavities in between. Due to this shrinkage the nuclei of muscle fibres became more prominent. At a relatively higher dose (0. 06 mg/ 1. 5 ml) condensation of muscle fibres was more severe and a homogeneous tissue was seen with the fragmentation of the nuclei. Blood vessels were also affected [...] At an acute dose (1. 25 mg/ 3 ml) the destruction and necrosis of muscle fibres was seen. This necrotic area had a large number of inflammatory cells including plasma cells, lymphocytes and macrophages. The most predominant among these were the lymphocytes. 9 In kidney tissues, by the action of ergotamine the interstitium and the glomeruli were affected. Higher doses caused greater damage to the glomeruli, which resulted in abscess formation. At a dose of 0. 03 mg/O. 5 ml there were slight changes in the interstitium and glomeruli, the parietal layer of the glomeruli inside the Bowman's capsule was intact, 3 glomerular spaces were reduced and the mesangium was obliterated. Inflammation with increase in the cellularity of the glomeruli was obvious. At a slightly higher dose, (0. 06 mg/ 1. 5 ml) proliferative glomerulonephritis was obvious; increased cellularity of the glomerulus was due to proliferation of the endothelial and visceral epithelial cells and the endothelial cells were also swollen. Higher dose (0. 09 mg/ 3 ml) affected the convoluted tubules as well as the glomerular morphology. Dilatation of the tubules and obliteration of glomerular spaces and mesangium occurred. Sclerosis due to inflammation and disintegration of glomerulus and parietal epithelium was obvious. Very high dose (1. 25 mg/ 3 ml) totally destroyed the glomerular structure and Bowman's capsule and replaced by lesions consisting of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages. Interstitium was also indistinguishable. 10 The Albino rats treated with various doses of caffeine showed almost similar histopathological findings. In liver tissues, hepatocytes became rounded with ill-defined cell wall and stained brighter. Hepatic cells around the central vein were badly affected and lost their morphological structure. At a little higher dose (6 mg/ 1. 5 ml), cellular integration was lost and cellular boundaries were hardly identifiable. When the concentration of the dose was increased (9 mg/ 3 ml), severe damage occurred to the hepatocytes and the central veins. Nuclei of the hepatocytes disappeared; vascular degeneration of hepatocytes produced specially in the central vein. Slugging in the central vein was more prominent. 11 When the animals were treated with a dose of 3 mg/ 0. 5 ml of caffeine, heart tissues were affected. The histological sections revealed that shrunken and condensation of heart muscles. At a higher dose (9 mg/ 3 ml), blood vessels were affected, loosing their normal structure of various layers and converted into indistinct tissue with numerous chromatin particles. Muscular condensation was also occurred and individual muscle fibres were not, 'distinct. At an acute dose (125 mg/ 3 ml), blocking of vessel and obliteration of <b>vessel</b> <b>observed.</b> Yellowish-brown pigment lipofuscin tend to accumulated in many tissues. 12 In kidney tissues, by the action of caffeine (3 mg/O. 5 ml) the glomerular spaces reduced and mesangium was not obvious. Slight edema of interstitium was also present. At a higher dose of caffeine (6 mg/ 1. 5 ml) atrophy of glomerulus structure resulted into a larger surrounding spaces in the Bowman's capsule. At a dose (9 mg/ 3. 0 ml) of caffeine, severe damages to the cellular structure of kidney noted. Edema of interstitium was obvious. Cellular differentiation in the glomeruli was not possible. At an acute dose (125 mg/ 3 ml) of caffeine coagulated necrosis has occurred with loss of cellular detail but tubular outlines were preserved and abscesses were formed. 13 The blood profile of the treated animals was not very much altered by the action of the drugs on low doses. However, there was slight increase in the WBCs and it might be due to the inflammatory responses, which were produced in the affected tissues. Slight decrease in haemoglobin was also evident. Ergotamine was found to be more toxic as compared to caffeine. Acute doses of both drugs produced significant effects on blood profiles of the test animals and the findings were altered as compared to normal ranges of the control animals. 14 Microbiological analysis of the blood of the treated animals did not reveal presence of any bacteria i. e., no bacteremia was detected. It means that the drugs neither alter the defense mechanism of the animals nor make them susceptible to the infection. Fecal samples of the treated animals were also normal and there was no marked difference among the samples regarding the species of the bacteria. Almost same normal flora of GIT was found in the treated rats. However, there was slight difference in the count of the normal flora. This finding indicates that the drugs did not alter the GIT micro flora of the animals...|$|E

The expansion of earlywood <b>vessels</b> was <b>observed</b> around 10 April (DOY 99. 7 ± 6. 1), the onset of lignifi cation around 22 April (DOY 111. 9 ± 7. 4) and the first latewood vessels around 28 May 2009 (DOY 147. 9 ± 4. 7). Lignifi cation of the last formed cells was completed by 26 September 2009 (DOY 273. 9 ± 10. 5). The average duration of tree-ring formation was 161 days in 2008 and 169 days in 2009, the average ring widths were 3296 ± 1514 μm in 2008 and 3166 ± 1073 μm in 2009, and latewood percentages comprised 76...|$|R
30|$|The {{specific}} histological {{finding in}} the present case was that lymphatic <b>vessels</b> were <b>observed</b> in the tumor. This finding suggests that cytokines are produced in the tumor tissues which induced the lymphatic vessels. Recent reports have indicated that vascular endothelial growth factor C and D induced neoplastic lymph angiogenesis and were related to lymph node metastasis in several cancers, including gallbladder carcinoma [14 – 16].|$|R
30|$|Although large <b>vessels</b> can be <b>observed</b> {{with most}} MR images, {{the use of}} {{steady-state}} fully refocused transverse magnetization GRE images (such as balanced, Fiesta or true-FISP) facilitates the observation of abnormal parenchyma vessels.|$|R

With their own fleet of <b>vessels</b> they <b>observe</b> {{wildlife}} and visit historical sights {{in remote areas}} with hardly any infrastructure. These areas are almost only reachable by boat. The tours take passengers to the Arctic and Antarctic regions with different points of destinations {{in which they can}} go ashore, mostly by small boats from the main vessels.|$|R
40|$|International audienceLymphatic {{collecting}} vessels direct lymph {{into and}} from lymph nodes (LNs) and can become hyperpermeable {{as the result}} of a previous infection. Enhanced permeability has been implicated in compromised immunity due to reduced flow of lymph and immune cells to LNs, which are the primary site of antigen presentation to T cells. Presently, very little is known about the molecular signals that affect lymphatic collecting vessel permeability. Here, we have shown that lymphatic collecting vessel permeability is controlled by CCR 7 and that the chronic hyperpermeability of collecting <b>vessels</b> <b>observed</b> in Ccr 7 –/– mice is followed by vessel fibrosis. Reexpression of CCR 7 in DCs, however, was sufficient to reverse the development of such fibrosis. IFN regulatory factor 4 –positive (IRF 4 +) DCs constitutively interacted with collecting lymphatics, and selective ablation of this DC subset in Cd 11 c-Cre Irf 4 fl/fl mice also rendered lymphatic collecting vessels hyperpermeable and fibrotic. Together, our data reveal that CCR 7 plays multifaceted roles in regulating collecting vessel permeability and fibrosis, with one of the key players being IRF 4 -dependent DCs...|$|R
40|$|Following craniotomy, {{three groups}} of cats were {{subjected}} to three different stimuli: group A hyperventilation, group B electroshock, and group C direct electric current. During electric stimuli, pial <b>vessels</b> were <b>observed</b> through a cranial window. Immediately after electric current application, some arterial vessels showed segmental spastic constriction. Tissue samples for electron-microscopy {{were taken from the}} parietal lobe and nucleus caudatus. In all {{three groups of}} animals, different types of constriction of blood <b>vessels</b> were <b>observed.</b> The respiratory alkalosis achieved by hyperventilation led to physiological constriction of the arterioles. The electric stimuli led to spastic constriction of the meningeal and intracerebral arteries and arterioles in group B and C; the entire vessel wall was greatly deformed and the vessel lumen was almost obstructed. Electroshock resulted in only moderate structural changes of the smooth muscle cells. Direct current, however, caused an extreme and bizarre smooth muscle deformation. The results show that spastic constrictions of arterioles can be clearly distinguished from physiological, that is non-spastic constriction, by morphological parameters. Electric stimulation of cerebral vessels could be an experimental condition for further investigation of intracerebral vasospasm...|$|R
