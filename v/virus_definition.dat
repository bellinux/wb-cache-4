5|$|MSE {{provides}} real-time protection, constantly monitoring {{activities on}} the computer and scanning new files as they are downloaded or created. It disables detected threats and prompts for user input {{on how to deal}} with them. If no response is received within ten minutes, suspected threats are handled according to the default actions defined in the application's settings. Depending on those settings, it may also create System Restore checkpoints before removing the detected malware. As a part of real-time protection, by default, MSE reports all suspicious behaviors of monitored programs to Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS, originally Microsoft SpyNet), a web-based service. If the report matches a newly discovered malware threat with an unreleased <b>virus</b> <b>definition,</b> the new definition is downloaded to remove the threat.|$|E
5|$|Neil Rubenking of PC Magazine {{successfully}} {{installed the}} beta version on 12 malware-infected systems and commented on its small installation package (about 7 MB, {{depending on the}} operating system) and speedy installation. But the initial <b>virus</b> <b>definition</b> update took between 5 and 15 minutes, and the full installation occupied about 110 MB of disk space. Rubenking noted that the beta version sets Windows Update into fully automatic mode, although it can be turned off again through Windows Control Panel. Some full scans took {{more than an hour}} on infected systems; a scan on a clean system took 35 minutes. An on-demand scan test Rubenking conducted in June 2009 with the beta version found 89 percent of all malware samples: 30 percent of the commercial keyloggers, 67 percent of rootkits, but only half of the scareware samples. The product's real-time protection found 83 percent of all malware and blocked the majority of it: 40 percent of the commercial keyloggers and 78 percent of the rootkits were found.|$|E
50|$|Intelligent Updater is an {{alternate}} delivery method for <b>virus</b> <b>definitions,</b> {{which consists of}} an executable file that can be downloaded and run manually. It is used to update <b>virus</b> <b>definitions</b> only. To install other updates a user must run LiveUpdate.|$|R
50|$|VSafe had {{a number}} of <b>virus</b> <b>definitions</b> {{embedded}} within its executable, but was capable of loading additional signatures (updates) from an external definition file.|$|R

It provides a number of utilities including a multi-threaded daemon, a command-line interface scanner and tool for automatic database updates. The core of the package is an anti-virus engine available in a form of a shared library. Immunet is provided in two versions, Free and Plus.|$|R

50|$|F-Prot Antivirus {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{antivirus}} products since its creation in 1989. It was the world's first with a heuristic engine. It is sold in both home and corporate packages, of which there are editions for Windows, Linux, and BSD. There are corporate versions for Microsoft Exchange, Solaris, and certain IBM eServers. The Linux and BSD versions are available to home users free of charge, with <b>virus</b> <b>definition</b> updates. Free 30-day trial versions for other platforms can be downloaded.|$|E
5000|$|Avira {{periodically}} [...] "cleans out" [...] its <b>virus</b> <b>definition</b> files, replacing specific signatures with generic {{ones for}} a general increase in performance and scanning speed. A 15 MB database clean-out was made on 27 October 2008, causing problems to the users of the Free edition because of its large size and Avira's slow Free edition servers. Avira responded by reducing {{the size of the}} individual update files, delivering less data in each update. Nowadays there are 32 smaller definition files that are updated regularly in order to avoid peaks in the download of the updates.|$|E
50|$|Level 2/4 {{describes}} {{a situation where}} an exploit of moderate concern is apparent and exposed systems may be vulnerable. Updating security software with new <b>virus</b> <b>definitions</b> is a priority.|$|R

50|$|Level 3/4 {{describes}} {{a situation where}} a known threat is either imminent or starting to affect the global network. Updating <b>virus</b> <b>definitions</b> and rules is a must, and increased monitoring is necessary as well, as well as reconfiguring security and firewall settings.|$|R
5000|$|On April 21, 2010, {{beginning}} approximately at 2 PM GMT, an erroneous <b>virus</b> <b>definition</b> file update from McAfee affected {{millions of}} computers worldwide running Windows XP Service Pack 3.

McAfee rectified this by removing and replacing the faulty DAT file, version 5958, with an emergency DAT file (version 5959) and has posted a fix for the affected machines in its consumer [...] "KnowledgeBase".|$|E
50|$|Windows Defender was {{released}} with Windows Vista and Windows 7, serving as their built-in antispyware component. In Windows Vista and Windows 7, Windows Defender was superseded by Microsoft Security Essentials, an antivirus product from Microsoft which provided protection against {{a wider range}} of malware. Upon installation, Microsoft Security Essentials disabled and replaced Windows Defender. In Windows 8, Microsoft upgraded Windows Defender into an antivirus program very similar to Microsoft Security Essentials for Windows 7 and using the same <b>virus</b> <b>definition</b> updates. MSE itself does not run on Windows versions beyond 7. In Windows 8 and Windows 10, Windows Defender is on by default. It switches itself off upon installation of a third party anti-virus package.|$|E

5|$|MSE {{is built}} upon the same {{foundation}} as other Microsoft security products; all {{use the same}} <b>virus</b> <b>definitions</b> and anti-malware engine, known as Microsoft Malware Protection Engine (MSMPENG). It {{does not have the}} personal firewall of OneCare or the centralized management features of Forefront Endpoint Protection.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{cloud based}} anti-malware {{software}} {{with its own}} signature database. Zemana AntiMalware is highly optimized and lightweight with <b>virus</b> <b>definitions</b> stored in the cloud not cluttering up PCs’ drive. Because it scans the files in the cloud, the detection time for new virus outbreaks is reduced.|$|R
50|$|What {{remains unclear}} {{is whether the}} trojan was {{designed}} as a joke or truly as a moral guardian. Regardless, anti-virus makers are blocking the software through <b>virus</b> <b>definitions.</b> Additionally, {{it remains to be seen}} whether this indicates a trend in malware or if it is simply a new term for a one-time occurrence.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, {{there may}} exist {{one or more}} unnamed - but still universally {{acknowledged}} - correlations between novelty and positive traits. For example, newer technology {{has a tendency to}} be more complex and advanced than older. A correlation may for example exist between newness of a <b>virus</b> <b>definition</b> file and the security of a computer, or between the newness of a computer and its speed and performance. In these precise cases, something {{may be more likely to}} be superior whenever it is new and modern, though not exclusively because it is new and modern. In some restricted cases, it may even be proven. Thus, what may seem like Appeal to novelty isn't a fallacy in every case. It is only a fallacy if the invoked correlations are disputed, if no correlation has been examined, or if the correlations are claimed as proofs.|$|E

Chen was {{executive vice president of}} the company until 1996 when she became chief technology officer. During her tenure as CTO she devised the Network VirusWall. In 2005, she assumed the position of CEO at Trend Micro. In April of the same year, she faced her first challenge when a faulty <b>virus</b> <b>definition</b> file caused PCs equipped with Trend Micro to freeze. Chen redesigned the software architecture to prevent a future malfunction. Under her leadership, Trend Micro has shifted its focus from traditional antivirus to cloud protection, purchasing Canadian security company Third Brigade in 2009 and cloud storage service humyo in 2010. In 2012, she received a Cloud Security Alliance Industry Leadership Award for her contributions to cloud security in the Asia-Pacific region.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two common}} methods that an {{antivirus}} software application uses to detect viruses, {{as described in}} the antivirus software article. The first, and by far the most common method of virus detection is using a list of virus signature definitions. This works by examining the content of the computer's memory (its Random Access Memory (RAM), and boot sectors) and the files stored on fixed or removable drives (hard drives, floppy drives, or USB flash drives), and comparing those files against a database of known virus [...] "signatures". Virus signatures are just strings of code that are used to identify individual viruses; for each virus, the antivirus designer tries to choose a unique signature string that will not be found in a legitimate program. Different antivirus programs use different [...] "signatures" [...] to identify viruses. The disadvantage of this detection method is that users are only protected from viruses that are detected by signatures in their most recent <b>virus</b> <b>definition</b> update, and not protected from new viruses (see [...] "zero-day attack").|$|E
5000|$|On April 21, 2010, {{beginning}} at approximately 14:00 UTC, millions of computers worldwide running Windows XP Service Pack 3 {{were affected by}} an erroneous <b>virus</b> <b>definition</b> file update by McAfee, resulting in the removal of a Windows system file (svchost.exe) on those machines, causing machines to lose network access and, in some cases, enter a reboot loop. McAfee rectified this by removing and replacing the faulty DAT file, version 5958, with an emergency DAT file, version 5959 and has posted a fix for the affected machines in their consumer knowledge base. The University of Michigan's medical school reported that 8,000 of its 25,000 computers crashed. Police in Lexington, Ky., resorted to hand-writing reports and turned off their patrol car terminals as a precaution. Some jails canceled visitation, and Rhode Island hospitals turned away non-trauma patients at emergency rooms and postponed some elective surgeries. Australian supermarket Coles reported that 10% (1,100) of its point-of-sales terminals were affected {{and was forced to}} shut down stores in both western and southern parts of the country. As a result of the outage, McAfee implemented additional QA protocols for any releases that directly impacted critical system files. The company also rolled out additional capabilities in Artemis that provide another level of protection against false positives by leveraging a whitelist of hands-off system files.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Sexual assault is {{a broad-based}} term that {{encompasses}} {{a wide range}} of sexual victimizations, including rape. Since the American Academy of Pediatrics published its last policy statement on this topic in 1994, additional information and data have emerged about sexual assault and rape in adolescents, the adolescent’s perception of sexual assault, and the treatment and management of the adolescent who has been a victim of sexual assault. This new information mandates an updated knowledge base for pediatricians who care for adolescent patients. This statement provides that update, focusing on sexual assault and rape in the adolescent population. ABBREVIATIONS. STDs, sexually transmitted diseases; HBV, hepatitis B virus; HIV, human immunodeficiency <b>virus.</b> <b>DEFINITION...</b>|$|E
50|$|Antivirus {{can be used}} {{to prevent}} {{propagation}} of malicious code. Most computer viruses have similar characteristics which allow for signature based detection. Heuristics such as file analysis and file emulation are also used to identify and remove malicious programs. <b>Virus</b> <b>definitions</b> should be regularly updated in addition to applying operating system hotfixes, service packs, and patches to keep computers on a network secure.|$|R
50|$|In {{its initial}} phase, the Cisco Network Admission Control (NAC) {{functionality}} enables Cisco routers to enforce access privileges when an endpoint attempts {{to connect to}} a network. This access decision {{can be on the}} basis of information about the endpoint device, such as its current antivirus state. The antivirus state includes information such as version of antivirus software, <b>virus</b> <b>definitions,</b> and version of scan engine.|$|R
50|$|Suspicious {{objects are}} {{analyzed}} across an internet connection using {{a range of}} online malware detection services (see multiscanning), and can be removed by HitmanPro if confirmed. Latest Version 3.7.9 uses Bitdefender and Kaspersky Lab as in-cloud technology partners. There is a very low system load because the <b>virus</b> <b>definitions</b> are not installed and tested in depth on the computer in question; rather they are analyzed remotely.|$|R
