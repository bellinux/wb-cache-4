25|$|Since his {{encounter}} with father Orlandis Canals’ interest was divided mostly between philosophy and theology. He perceived the latter {{not as a}} speculative exercise but as a discursive science, subject to usual rational <b>verification</b> <b>procedures</b> yet remaining {{in the service of}} Roman Catholic faith. His opus falls largely into two branches, dogmatic theology and historical theology. Since the late 1960s he was increasingly recognized as authority by a number of Catholic institutions and organizations. Among the Spanish Traditionalist intellectuals he was perhaps the one least skeptical about Vaticanum II and afterwards remained firmly within the Vatican-defined orthodoxy. This was certified by the 1998 nomination to St. Thomas’ Academy and the 2002 honor of commander of Ordo Sancti Gregorii Magni, both conferred upon him by John Paul II; Canals was personally appreciated by the Pope and in his writings explored a number of concepts coined earlier by Karol Wojtyła.|$|E
500|$|On 21 March 1961, test-ban {{negotiations}} resumed in Geneva and Arthur Dean, a lead US envoy, {{offered a}} new proposal {{in an attempt}} {{to bridge the gap between}} the two sides. The early Kennedy proposal largely grew out of later Eisenhower efforts, with a ban on all tests but low-yield underground ones (below magnitude 4.75), which would be subject to a three-year moratorium. The US and UK proposed 20 on-site inspections per annum, while the Soviet Union proposed three. The <b>verification</b> <b>procedures</b> included in the Anglo-American plan were unacceptable to Tsarapkin, who responded with separate proposals rejected by the Western powers. Specifically, the Soviet Union proposed a [...] "troika" [...] mechanism: a monitoring board composed of representatives of the West, the Soviet Union, and nonaligned states that would require unanimity before acting (effectively giving the Soviet Union veto authority). In May 1961, Kennedy attempted via secret contact between Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and a Soviet intelligence officer to settle on 15 inspections per year. This was rejected by Khrushchev.|$|E

2500|$|Before the {{computerization}} {{of credit}} card systems in America, using a credit card to pay at a merchant was significantly more complicated than it is today. Each time a consumer wanted to use a credit card, the merchant would have to call their bank, who in turn had to call the credit card company, which then had to have an employee manually look up the customer's name and credit balance. This system was computerized in 1973 {{under the leadership of}} Dee Hock, the first CEO of Visa, allowing transaction time to decrease substantially to less than one minute. [...] However, until always-connected payment terminals became ubiquitous {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century, it was common for a merchant to accept a charge, especially below a threshold value or from a known and trusted customer, without verifying it by phone. [...] Books with lists of stolen card numbers were distributed to merchants who were supposed in any case to check cards against the list before accepting them, as well as verifying the signature on the charge slip against that on the card. [...] Merchants who failed to take the time to follow the proper <b>verification</b> <b>procedures</b> were liable for fraudulent charges, but because of the cumbersome nature of the procedures, merchants would often simply skip some or all of them and assume the risk for smaller transactions.|$|E
30|$|Hearing {{instrument}} verification involves {{measuring the}} performance of modulation-based noise reduction systems. The article proposes a systematic <b>procedure</b> for their <b>verification.</b> The <b>procedure</b> {{has the potential for}} application in the verification of other signal processing systems, because it is independent of the hearing instrument domain. Its key concept, the separation of abstract and concrete design of test signals, has been adopted from the embedded systems domain. Specifically for modulation-based noise reduction systems in hearing instruments, the article shows a complete implementation of the <b>verification</b> <b>procedure,</b> proposing improvements of existing measurement techniques. To fully cover the <b>verification</b> <b>procedure,</b> a new measurement approach based on maximum length sequences and DFT processing is introduced, revisiting concepts of system identification that came up in the 1970 s. These can easily be used with the computational resources of today's microcomputers. Sample measurements with existing hearing instruments demonstrate the <b>verification</b> <b>procedure</b> with different measurement techniques.|$|R
