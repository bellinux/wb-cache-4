40|$|Abstract—The {{application}} of nonlinear transformations to a linearly modulated communication signal {{for the purpose}} of revealing hidden periodicities has proven to be useful for automatic modulation recognition (AMR). The fact that the hidden periodicities, referred to as Higher Order Cyclostationary Statistics (HOCS), are compressible in the Fourier domain motivates the use of compressive sensing (CS) as an efficient acquisition protocol for capturing such signals. In this work, we consider the task of performing AMR when CS is used to acquire the communication signal. We develop a theoretical framework for estimating HOCS using the low-rate nonuniform sampling protocol from CS and validate our theory using simulated data.
