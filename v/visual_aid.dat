The views of 100 teachers regarding usage of <b>visual</b> <b>aids,</b> providing <b>visual</b> <b>aids,</b> as well as male and female differences are considered and views of experienced and less experienced teachers are investigated. The necessary data is collected by using questionnaires.

All respondents believe on the importance of using <b>visual</b> <b>aids.</b> Also the result shows that male and female teachers use the <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> but, with some differences, as it is clearly shown in the findings some use one type, but some use other types. Kabul TTC teachers use more <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> than Wardak province TTC teachers. In addition to that the important finding is the differences between experienced and less experienced teachers, the junior teachers use more <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> than senior or experienced ones. These findings would not be generalized for the whole country. But it could be considered for the central region of Afghanistan, because the two TTCs are located in the central region of Afghanistan...|$|R

40|$|Many {{people have}} {{difficulties}} grasping numerical concepts that are prerequisites for understanding treatment risk reduction. <b>Visual</b> <b>aids</b> {{have been proposed}} as a promising method for enhancing comprehension. In a survey of probabilistic, nationally representative samples in two different countries (United States and Germany), we compared the effectiveness of adding different types of <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> (icon arrays and bar graphs representing either affected individuals only or the entire population at risk) to the numerical information in either an absolute or a relative risk reduction format.

Highest increases were achieved when the <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> depicted the entire population at risk. Importantly, <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> were most useful for the participants who had low numeracy but relatively high graphical literacy skills. Building on previous research showing that problems with understanding numerical information often do not reside in people's minds, but in the representation of the problem, our results show that <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> help to modify incorrect expectations about treatment risk reduction.

Methods: A questionnaire based study {{was carried out}} among first year MBBS students of Government Medical College, Kota, India. The survey was undertaken among 84 Medical students of first year MBBS of batch 2008 after exposing them to different <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> like BB, OHPT and LCD in Physiology lectures.

Results: 55 (65. 48 %) students rated chalk & black board as best <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> in understanding the topic better as compared to OHPT and LCD (P< 0. 01). 47 (55. 95 %) students have good learning experience with black board teaching and it is best mode to note down important points. 56 (66. 66 %) students favored LCD as more interesting and interactive <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> (P< 0. 01).

Another explanation is that individual sounds do not easily translate into beats, which makes clapping individual phonemes a much more difficult task than clapping syllables.

He also got a Monash University mathematics professor Terry Speed, to explain that Ryan 5 feet 8inches (1.73 m) tall {{would have had to}} have been 8 feet 3inches (2.55 m) tall to have fired the shot. These calculations were based on Ryan being twenty feet from Hodson and Hodson was standing perfectly upright. The bullet would enter Hodson's body 62inches from the ground and exit 61inches from the ground. If the shot was in a downward angle the bullet would have hit the road forty feet from where Hodson was hit, it also suggested that Hodson could have been shot from another elevated point and possibly by another prison officer. It would cast doubt that Ryan had fired the fatal shot. But the prosecution argued that Hodson 6 feet 1inch (1.85 m) tall could have been running in a stooped position, thus accounting for the bullet's fatal angle of entry. No witnesses saw or testified seeing Hodson running in a stooped position.|$|E

Falle responded that most prostitution has already moved indoors, as the internet has made most street solicitation unnecessary, and argues that the move indoors has not made the women safer. She said that when she was in prostitution, she was even a little safer outdoors because of the added visibility to the public.

When Creangă recounts, the composition is not extraordinary, but once his heroes begin talking, their gesticulation and wording reach a height in typical storytelling." [...] According to the critic, discovering this [...] "fundamental" [...] notion about Creangă's work was the merit of literary historian and Viața Românească editor Garabet Ibrăileanu, who had mentioned it as a main proof of affiliation to realism.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{variety of}} {{multimodal}} treatment options {{are available for}} colorectal cancer and many patients {{want to be involved}} in decisions about their therapies. However, their desire for autonomy is limited by lack of disease-specific knowledge. <b>Visual</b> <b>aids</b> may be helpful tools to present complex data in an easy-to-understand, graphic form to lay persons. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the treatment preferences of healthy persons and patients using <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> depicting multimodal treatment options for colorectal cancer. Methods We designed <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> for treatment scenarios based on four key studies concerning multimodal treatment of colorectal cancer. The <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> were composed of diagrams depicting outcome parameters and side effects of two treatment options. They were presented to healthy persons (n[*]=[*] 265) and to patients with colorectal cancer (n[*]=[*] 102). Results Most patients and healthy persons could make immediate decisions after seeing the diagrams (range: 88 % – 100 %). Patients (79 %) chose the intensive-treatment option in the scenario with a clear survival benefit. In scenarios without survival benefit, all groups clearly preferred the milder treatment option (range: 78 % - 90 %). No preference was seen in the scenario depicting equally intense treatment options with different timing (neoadjuvant vs. adjuvant) but without survival benefit. Conclusions Healthy persons’ and patients’ decisions using <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> seem to be influenced by quality-of-life aspects rather than recurrence rates especially in situations without survival benefit. In the future <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> may help to improve the management of patients with colorectal cancer. </p...|$|R
