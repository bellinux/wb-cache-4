50|$|In June 2010, <b>Volcano</b> <b>expert</b> Hazel Rymer said seismic {{activity}} was increasing at Askja {{and that an}} eruption could be around the corner The increased earthquake activity is located to the northeast of the central volcano, {{in the direction of}} Herðubreið. It was ruled out that any activity from Eyjafjallajökull was responsible for the increase in activity at Askja. The news came as scientists continue to watch Katla.|$|E

Since different volcanic events have different durations, therefore the state and whole event durations learnt from the training data are enforced on the corresponding state and event duration modes within-the HMM. Seismic signals from the Llaima volcano are used to train the system. Two types of events are employed in this study, Long Period (LP) and Volcano-Tectonic (VT). Experiments show that the standard HMMs can detect the volcano events with high accuracy but generates false positives. The results {{presented in this paper}} show that the incorporation of duration modeling can lead to reductions in false positive rate in event detection as high as 31 % with a true positive accuracy equal to 94 %. Further evaluation of the false positives indicate that the false alarms generated by the system were mostly potential events based on the signal-to-noise ratio criteria recommended by a <b>volcano</b> <b>expert.</b> Chilean National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT), PIA, Anillo project 	 ACT- 1120 FONDEF IDeA 	 CA 13 I 10273 OVDA...|$|E
30|$|Previous {{experience}} with fire emergencies or similar situations may significantly affect RP, vigilance, and preparedness {{and has been}} identified as one of the strongest predictors of increased perceived risk during natural disasters (Wachinger et al. 2012). However, experiencing a disaster without experiencing personal harm may decrease perceived risk. (For an overview of studies on RP, experience, and natural disasters, see Wachinger et al. 2012). Research from volcano disasters showed that having experience in a disaster diminished differences in RP between <b>volcano</b> <b>experts</b> and untrained participants (Bird and Gisladottir 2012). Similarly, survivors of the 1993 WTC bombing had shorter evacuation delays than occupants who had no such experience during the evacuation of the WTC on September 11, 2001 (Day et al. 2013). Therefore, the effects of previous experience on RP are still under debate, although it seems possible that increased perceived risk moderates the connection between evacuation decision-making and previous experience.|$|R
