5000|$|Inspection is a <b>verification</b> <b>method</b> {{that is used}} {{to compare}} how true the {{conceptual}} model matches the executable model. Teams of experts, developers, and testers will thoroughly scan the content (algorithms, programming code, documents, equations) in the original conceptual model, and compare with the appropriate counterpart to verify how closely the executable model matches. [...] One of the main purposes of this method of verification is to see what original goals have been overlooked. By doing an inspection check on the model, the team can not only see what issues might have been overlooked, but also catch any potential flaws that can become an issue later in the project.|$|E
50|$|In EMV-mode transactions, Apple Pay {{supports}} {{the use of}} the Consumer Device Cardholder <b>Verification</b> <b>Method</b> (CDCVM) using Touch ID, or the phone's or watch's passcode. The use of CDCVM allows for the device itself to provide verification for the transaction and may negate the requirement for the cardholder to sign a receipt or enter their PIN. Additionally, in certain markets which have a 'no verification contactless limit' using contactless cards (such as the current £30 limit in the United Kingdom and the $100 limit in Canada), the use of CDCVM can enable merchants to accept transactions higher than these amounts using Apple Pay, providing their terminal software is updated to support the latest network contactless specifications.|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{technological}} progress in authentication continues to evolve, these systems do not prevent aliases being used. The introduction of strong authentication for online payment transactions within the European Union now links a verified person to an account, where such {{person has been}} identified in accordance with statutory requirements prior to account being opened. The concept of reliance authentication makes use of pre-existing accounts, to piggy back further services upon those accounts, providing that the original source is reliable. The concept of reliability comes from various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism funding legislation in the USA, EU28, Australia, Singapore and New Zealand where second parties may place reliance on the customer due diligence process of the first party, where the first party is say a financial institution. An example of reliance authentication is PayPal's <b>verification</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E
