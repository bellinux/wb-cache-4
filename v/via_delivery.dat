50|$|In business, {{demurrage}} is a {{delay in}} delivery of a product <b>via</b> <b>delivery</b> truck. When a delay occurs with product delivery, the delivery party can elect to claim a no fault delay by submitting a demurrage charge. Criteria for allowable demurrage, payment conditions, and payment terms for demurrage are typically prenegotiated and accepted by the vendor via contract prior to conduct of business. Some vendors allow free no-cost time for limited hour(s) when demurrage occurs, others do not allow free time for delays. The demurrage charge is normally an hourly rate. Unforeseeable until delivery, costs of delays are sometimes separately invoiced from the cost of deliverable.|$|E
5000|$|The Eastern Zhejiang Canal {{served as}} an {{important}} postal route. At {{the base of the}} canal there was a station called the Xixing Post. Official documents were sent to Shaoxing, Ningbo and Taizhou by post via the canal. The postal system was also responsible for service <b>via</b> <b>delivery</b> stores. In the Song dynasty (960-1279), 12 post houses were put up along the canal; these were reduced in number later in the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). After the twentieth year of Qianlong of the Qing dynasty, the Xixing Post was kept while setting up posts in other counties. In the thirty-second year of the reign of the Guangxu emperor, modern Chinese post was established and delivery stores abolished. In the third year of his reign, emperor Xuantong abdicated causing all post houses to close while certain post functions of the canal remained till the popularization of railways and roads.|$|E
5000|$|Although most systems operate <b>via</b> <b>delivery</b> of a {{constant}} train of stimulation, {{there is now}} the advent of so-called [...] "feed-forward" [...] stimulation where the device's activation is contingent on a physiological event, such as an epileptic seizure. In this circumstance, the device is activated and delivers a desynchronizing pulse to the cortical area that is undergoing an epileptic seizure. This concept of feed-forward stimulation will likely become more prevalent as physiological markers of targeted diseases and neural disorders are discovered and verified. The on-demand stimulation may contribute to longer battery life, if sensing and signal-processing demands of the system are sufficiently power-efficient. New electrode designs could yield more efficient and precise stimulation, requiring less current and minimizing unwanted side-stimulation. In addition, to overcome the challenge of preventing lead migration {{in areas of the}} body that are subject to motion such as turning and bending, researchers are exploring developing small stimulation systems that are recharged wirelessly rather than through an electrical lead.|$|E

Thus, we successfully established an approach that can potentially be used to introduce targeted DNA inversions of interest for functional studies and crop improvement...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} multihop broadcast over adap-tively duty-cycled wireless sensor networks (WSNs) where neighborhood nodes are not simultaneously awake. We present Hybrid-cast, an asyn-chronous and multihop broadcasting protocol, which {{can be applied to}} low duty-cycling or quorum-based duty-cycling schedule where nodes send out a beacon message at the beginning of wakeup slots. Hybrid-cast achieves better tradeoff between broadcast latency and broadcast count compared to previous broadcast solutions. It adopts opportunis-tic data delivery {{in order to reduce the}} broadcast latency. Meanwhile, it reduces redundant transmission <b>via</b> <b>delivery</b> deferring and online for-warder selection. We establish the upper bound of broadcast count and the broadcast latency for a given duty-cycling schedule. We evaluate Hybrid-cast through extensive simulations. The results validate the ef-fectiveness and efficiency of our design. ...|$|E

30|$|We have {{developed}} a medium-based protocol for inducing the differentiation of bone marrow-derived multi-potent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) into neurotrophic factor-secreting cells (MSC-NTF cells). These MSC-NTF cells have been developed into a novel cell therapy which aims to target the affected motor neurons <b>via</b> <b>delivery</b> of Neurotrophic Factors (NTF) directly {{to the site of}} tissue damage in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients. In this cell therapy approach, the patients’ bone marrow derived MSCs are propagated ex-vivo and induced to secrete elevated levels of NTF such as Glial Cell Line Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF) and Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Vascular Endothelial Growth factor (VEGF) and Hepatocyte Growth factor (HGF). These NTF are delivered to the cell body in the spinal cord via intrathecal (IT) administration, and/or to the motor end plates via intramuscular (IM) administration.|$|E

On the contrary, a particular node sometimes has to process concentrated sensor data. This overloaded node makes the system unstable. We adopt a topology of three step tree, considering features of large scale sensor networks. We propose a {{method by which}} the proposed Publish/Subscribe system manages information of nodes/subscriptions based on geographical location and dynamically divides/reassigns operators based on loads of nodes. The method realizes load balancing among processing nodes and real-time data transmission on large scale sensor networks. We made a testbed on a real environment {{to show that the}} proposed method distributes overload and keeps stability of the system, dividing and reassigning on the three step topology. 広域センサネットワークにおいてPublish/Subscribeシステムを用いることで，ストリームデータとして生成されるセンサデータの配送時に，データの選別と計算処理によるトラフィックの削減が可能となる．ただし，センサデータが特定の処理ノードへ集中することによって過負荷状態が発生することが問題となる．本提案では広域センサネットワークの特性を考慮した，三段木のトポロジを配送ネットワークとして採用する．また，Publish/Subscribe型センサネットワークにおいて地理位置情報に基づいてノードやSubscriptionの情報を管理し，負荷に応じて動的にオペレータの分割および再配置を可能とする手法を提案する．これにより，配送負荷を分散しつつ，リアルタイムなデータ配送を行うことが可能となった．提案システムを実環境に構築し，三段木のトポロジを用いた動的な分割および再配置による負荷分散手法によって特定の処理ノードが過負荷に陥らず処理の継続が可能であることを検証した...|$|E
