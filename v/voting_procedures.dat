40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the UN Security Council (SC), its <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> and effectiveness. A hypothetic change of the SC <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> is applied in the thesis.

In addition, I aim to find out how would change the ability of the Security Council permanent members to further their national interests? Analysis is focused on the blocked SC resolutions with the negative vote of only one of its five permanent members. In {{the last part of the}} analysis I aim to discover, whether there is any connection between the structure of the SC <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> in the security issues discussed in the GA. Analysis is based on the presumption, that some security issues do not become a matter of the SC voting process due to the negative vote of one of its permanent members in the GA. Such issues would be probably blocked in the SC. It means that certain security issues do not appear in the Security Council due to the structure of its <b>voting</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|R

He denied the cardinals the right to choose a pope by acclamation or by assigning the election to a select group of cardinals. He established new <b>voting</b> <b>procedures</b> the cardinals could follow if the balloting continued for several days, but those were not invoked in this conclave.

Biggs served from January 18, 1887 until January 20, 1891. Two years later the Republicans began their long road back and took advantage of splits in the Democratic leadership to elect a small majority in the State House. Meanwhile, Biggs did as countless governors before him, and pleaded with the General Assembly for all kinds of reform, including better representation for New Castle County, and reform of the <b>voting</b> <b>procedures.</b> And as usual, he was largely ignored, except for a provision to establish a State Hospital for the Insane, now the Delaware State Hospital at Farnhurst.|$|E

30|$|This {{is quite}} an {{interesting}} result, {{since we were}} expecting to have less CHs by increasing the connectivity (number of maximum hops).

We realized that throughout the <b>voting</b> <b>procedure,</b> nodes are not voting for themselves {{even though they may}} have the highest connectivity. This may result in more CHs to be elected than needed. In order to fix this problem, we revised Kachirski et al.’s clustering algorithm by letting the nodes vote for themselves (if they have the highest connectivity index).|$|R

2500|$|The {{film was}} a success, and Davis' confronting {{characterization}} won praise from critics, with Life writing {{that she gave}} [...] "probably the best performance ever recorded on the screen by a U.S. actress". Davis anticipated that her reception would encourage Warner Bros. to cast her in more important roles, and was disappointed when Jack L.

When Davis was not nominated for an Academy Award for Of Human Bondage, The Hollywood Citizen News questioned the omission and Norma Shearer, herself a nominee, joined a campaign to have Davis nominated. This prompted an announcement from the Academy president, Howard Estabrook, who said that under the circumstances [...] "any voter...may write on the ballot his or her personal choice for the winners", thus allowing, for {{the only time in}} the Academy's history, the consideration of a candidate not officially nominated for an award.
