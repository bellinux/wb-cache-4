Although at least three pads were planned, only two, designated A and B, were completed in October 1965. The LOC also included an Operations and Checkout Building (OCB) to which Gemini and Apollo spacecraft were initially received prior to being mated to their launch vehicles.

40|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> {{is used as}} a {{new method}} to {{suppress}} gas explosion. Explosion propagation characteristics were studied in a system composed of rectangular pipes and a <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber.</b> The volume of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> was adjusted by inserting PVC sheets into it. Two groups of explosion suppression experiments were conducted. In one group, the distance between the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> and the explosive source point was 3 [*]m and in the other group, this distance was 4 [*]m. The results demonstrated that the effect of explosion suppression of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> is related to the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber’s</b> critical volume. When the volume of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> was greater than the critical volume, the chamber exhibited a good explosion suppression effect. When the volume of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> was less than the critical volume, it could not suppress the explosion, and the explosive pressure and flame were stronger than those measured {{in the absence of the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber.</b> On the basis of the experimental results, we further analyzed the suppression mechanism of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> and concluded that stretching of the explosion flame front as well as alteration of the composition of the explosive gas led to the explosive flame being extinguished...|$|R

2500|$|The moving-belt {{interface}} (MBI) {{was developed}} in 1977. This interface [...] consisted of an endless moving belt receiving the LC column effluent. On the belt, the solvent was evaporated by gently heating and efficiently exhausting [...] the solvent vapors under reduced pressure in two <b>vacuum</b> <b>chambers.</b> After removing the liquid phase, the analytes would desorb from the belt and migrate to the MS ion source to be analysed. MBI was successfully used for LC-MS applications between 1978 and 1990 because it allowed coupling of LC to MS devices using EI, CI, and fast-atom bombardment (FAB) ion sources. The most common MS systems connected by MBI interfaces to LC columns were magnetic sector and quadropole instruments. MBI interfaces for LC-MS allowed MS to be widely applied {{in the analysis of}} drugs, pesticides, steroids, alkaloids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This interface is no longer used because of its mechanical complexity and the difficulties associated to belt renewal. Particle beam interfaces took over the wide applications of MBI for LC-MS in 1988.|$|E
