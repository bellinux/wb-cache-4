5|$|The John Dory, {{though of}} uninviting appearance, is {{considered}} by some persons as the most delicious fish that appears at table; in the general estimation, however, it ranks next to the turbot, but it is far less abundant in our waters, and is not commonly to be procured of sufficient size for a handsome dish, except in some few parts of our coast which are celebrated for it. It may easily be known by its yellow gray colour, its one large dark spot on either side, the long filaments on the back, a general thickness of form, and its <b>very</b> <b>ugly</b> head. It is dressed in the same manner, and served usually with the same sauces as a turbot, but requires less time to boil it. The fins should be cut off before it is cooked.|$|E

Automobile Quarterly magazine thought the car <b>very</b> <b>ugly</b> and expressed dislike for the inadequacy of the rear-view window, {{the positions of the}} steering-wheel and stoplights, the softness of the front seats, and the design of the pedals.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wrath}} of a horrendous start to the season, United had {{scheduled}} a friendly against the Italian Serie A giants, A.C. Milan. Although missing several of their regular starters, it {{was expected to be}} a <b>very,</b> <b>ugly,</b> one-sided match. Ironically, United would pull of a shock 3–2 victory over Milan in front of nearly 31,000 fans at RFK Stadium.|$|E
50|$|Jokke (real name Joachim Jacobsen, English: Raymond) {{used to be}} {{a notorious}} flirt with the <b>very</b> <b>ugliest</b> women to be found, due to some {{internal}} code that no opportunity should ever be left unattempted. Very often this would lead him to get severely beaten up. He is of the same age as Pondus, and sees himself as his equal in every way, not least in terms of strength which they occasionally measure, always ending in a tie. Jokke is also Pondus' equal in terms of football fanhood, but his less fortunate destiny is supporting Leeds United, a club doomed to poor results of recent years. He also plays Old Boys football with Pondus, as goalkeeper, but he is not very good. His favourite band is KISS which also is in conflict to Pondus' AC/DC.|$|R

She then {{picks up the phone and}} tells the police she would like to report a double murder.|$|E
25|$|Returning {{home in the}} 1850s, Constantin {{married a}} second time, to Ecaterina Sturza. This granddaughter of Prince Ioan Sturdza was {{reportedly}} <b>very</b> <b>ugly</b> but also highly intelligent and energetic; she was Dumitru's mother. Born in Iași, Dumitru spent his first four years at Făurei, which he later declared to be his favorite place in the world. During that interval, his father became rivals with Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica. In 1854, {{at the height of}} the Crimean War, Constantin and his family crossed from Moldavia-proper into Bessarabia (a Russian governorate, formerly part of Moldavia). This was done upon orders from the Austrian occupation authorities, on a request from the Ottoman army, or, alternatively, from Prince Ghica himself. Constantin was naturalized Russian and was possibly a Russian agent of influence in Moldavia. In the 1860s, he was directly involved in Russian censorship of Moldavian liberal newspapers and magazines.|$|E
500|$|Lucas came up {{with ideas}} that {{involved}} a religious cult devoted to child slavery, black magic and ritual human sacrifice. Lawrence Kasdan of Raiders of the Lost Ark was asked to write the script. [...] "I didn't want {{to be associated with}} Temple of Doom," [...] he reflected. [...] "I just thought it was horrible. It's so mean. There's nothing pleasant about it. I think Temple of Doom represents a chaotic period in both their [...] lives, and the movie is <b>very</b> <b>ugly</b> and mean-spirited." [...] Lucas hired Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz to write the script because of their knowledge of Indian culture. Gunga Din served as an influence for the film.|$|E
60|$|Their {{clothes were}} very interesting. For ugliness of shapes, and for miracles of ugly colors inharmoniously associated, {{they were a}} record. The effect was nearly as {{exciting}} and interesting as that produced by the brilliant and beautiful clothes and perfect taste always {{on view at the}} Indian railway stations. One man had corduroy trousers of a faded chewing gum tint. And they were new--showing that this tint did not come by calamity, but was intentional; the <b>very</b> <b>ugliest</b> color I have ever seen. A gaunt, shackly country lout six feet high, in battered gray slouched hat with wide brim, and old resin-colored breeches, had on a hideous brand-new woolen coat which was imitation tiger skin--wavy broad stripes of dazzling yellow and deep brown. I thought he ought to be hanged, and asked the station-master if it could be arranged. He said no; and not only that, but said it rudely; said it with a quite unnecessary show of feeling. Then he muttered something about my being a jackass, and walked away and pointed me out to people, and did everything he could to turn public sentiment against me. It is what one gets for trying to do good.|$|R

500|$|From her {{earliest}} {{years she}} was known for her compassionate heart and desire to help others, but also for her temper, blunt honesty and moodiness. As a small child, she once lost patience while posing for a portrait painter and told the man, [...] "You are a <b>very</b> <b>ugly</b> man and I don't like you one bit!" [...] The Tsar's children were raised as simply as possible, sleeping on hard camp cots unless they were ill, taking cold baths every morning. Servants called Olga and her siblings {{by their first names}} and patronyms rather than by their imperial titles. However, Olga's governess and tutors also noted some of the autocratic impulses of the daughter of the Tsar of All the Russias, one of the wealthiest men in the world. On a visit to a museum where state carriages were on display, Olga once ordered one of the servants to prepare the largest and most beautiful carriage for her daily drive. Her wishes were not honored, much to the relief of her governess, Margaretta Eagar. She also felt the rights of eldest children should be protected. When she was told the Biblical story of Joseph and his coat of many colors, she sympathized with the eldest brothers rather than Joseph. She also sympathized with Goliath rather than David in the Biblical story of David and Goliath. When her French tutor, Pierre Gilliard, was teaching her the formation of French verbs and the use of auxiliaries, ten-year-old Olga responded, [...] "I see, monsieur. The auxiliaries are the servants of the verbs. It's only poor 'avoir' which has to shift for itself." ...|$|E

The following year his work was featured in the Salon des Indépendants. Of Duchamp's pieces in the show, critic Guillaume Apollinaire—who {{was to become a}} friend—criticized what he called [...] "Duchamp's <b>very</b> <b>ugly</b> nudes". Duchamp also became lifelong friends with exuberant artist Francis Picabia after meeting him at the 1911 Salon d'Automne, and Picabia proceeded to introduce him to a lifestyle of fast cars and [...] "high" [...] living.|$|E

2500|$|That the Rising {{resulted}} in {{a great deal of}} death and destruction, as well as disrupting food supplies, also contributed to the antagonism toward the rebels. After the surrender, the Volunteers were hissed at, pelted with refuse, and denounced as [...] "murderers" [...] and [...] "starvers of the people". Volunteer Robert Holland for example remembered being [...] "subjected to <b>very</b> <b>ugly</b> remarks and cat-calls from the poorer classes" [...] as they marched to surrender. He also reported being abused by people he knew as he was marched through the Kilmainham area into captivity and said the British troops saved them from being manhandled by the crowd.|$|E
2500|$|The unicorn, tamable only by {{a virgin}} woman, was well {{established}} in medieval lore by the time Marco Polo described them as [...] "scarcely smaller than elephants.

They have a head like a wild boar's… They spend their time by preference wallowing in mud and slime. They are <b>very</b> <b>ugly</b> brutes to look at. They are not at all such as we describe them when we relate that they let themselves be captured by virgins, but clean contrary to our notions."

2500|$|Commentators {{attributed}} the rivalry between {{the left and}} the right as an important factor in the controversy. The NAACP had passed a resolution asking the Tea Party to repudiate racist language among its members. Breitbart said he posted the videos in response. [...] Commentators from each side noted that racial issues were being manipulated for political gain. Imani Perry, a professor at Princeton's Center for African American Studies, said some conservatives manipulated white fears for political advantage:I think many white Americans are fearful that with Obama in the White House, and the diversity in his appointments, that the racial balance of power is shifting. And that's frightening both because people always are afraid to give up privilege, and because of the prospect of a black-and-brown backlash against a <b>very</b> <b>ugly</b> history. Some liberals have long maintained that racism requires power, and so black people can't be racist. Obama's election undercut the first argument and made the specter of black racism appear more threatening.|$|E
