5|$|A {{controller}} in {{the cockpit}} allowed the <b>visor</b> to be retracted and the nose to be lowered to 5° below the standard horizontal position for taxiing and take-off. Following take-off and after clearing the airport, the nose and <b>visor</b> were raised. Prior to landing, the <b>visor</b> was again retracted and the nose lowered to 12.5° below horizontal for maximal visibility. Upon landing the nose was raised to the 5° position to avoid the possibility of damage.|$|E
5|$|Concorde's {{drooping}} nose, {{developed by}} Marshall's of Cambridge at Cambridge Airport, enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal aerodynamic efficiency without obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and landing operations. Due {{to the high}} angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose {{was accompanied by a}} moving <b>visor</b> that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the <b>visor</b> would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.|$|E
5|$|The Crosby Garrett helmet is {{an almost}} {{complete}} example of a two-piece Roman cavalry helmet. The <b>visor</b> portrays {{the face of a}} youthful, clean-shaven male with curly hair. The headpiece is {{in the shape of a}} Phrygian cap, on the crest of which is a winged griffin that stands with one raised foot resting on an amphora. The <b>visor</b> was originally attached to the headpiece by means of a hinge; the iron hinge pin has not survived, but its existence has been inferred from the presence of powdery deposits of iron oxide residue. The helmet would have been held in place using a leather strap attached from the wearer's neck to a decorated rivet on either side of the helmet, below the ear. Wear marks caused by opening and closing the <b>visor</b> are still visible, and at some point the helmet was repaired using a bronze sheet which was riveted across two splits. Only two other Roman helmets complete with visors have been found in Britain – the Newstead Helmet and Ribchester Helmet.|$|E

25|$|The {{children}} {{access the}} virtual world through Internet-connected <b>visors,</b> which they refer to as megane, the usual term for protective or corrective eyeglasses. The <b>visors</b> allow them to see virtual reality superimposed on objective reality. To visually confirm something as virtual, the children often lift their <b>visors</b> from their eyes. The <b>visors</b> also work in conjunction with futuristic ear monitors placed behind the ear, which allow the wearer to hear sounds from the virtual environment.|$|R

5|$|The {{helmet and}} <b>visor</b> were cast from an alloy {{consisting}} {{of an average}} of 82% copper, 10% zinc and 8% tin. This alloy was probably derived from melted-down scrap brass with a low zinc content, with which some tin had been added {{to improve the quality}} of the casting. Some of the fragments show traces of a white metal coating, indicating that the <b>visor</b> would originally have been tinned to give the appearance of silver. The griffin was cast separately from a different alloy consisting of 68% copper, 4% zinc, 18% tin and 10% lead. The <b>visor</b> would originally have been a silver hue and the helmet would have had a coppery yellow appearance. The helmet's creation can be dated to the late 2nd or early 3rd century from the use of a particular type of decorated rivet as well as some of its design features, such as its pierced eyes.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes, Prost used {{variants}} of his helmet design, in 2007 {{he used his}} original design, but with the circle top all red and a red line in the lower chin area. In 2010, he used a pearl white helmet with silver flames and a blue-white-red-white-blue stripe trepassing the <b>visor,</b> designed by kaos design.|$|E
5|$|The finder {{discovered}} the helmet and <b>visor</b> buried together some 25cm (10in) below the surface, {{at a site}} located on a ledge {{at the lower end}} of the settlement. It had been placed onto two stone slabs at the bottom of a hole which had been back-filled with soil. A stone cap had been laid on top. The helmet was found in 33 large fragments and 34 small fragments and had apparently been folded before burial. The <b>visor</b> was mostly intact and had been placed face down. The griffin had become detached and was found with the helmet. No other artefacts were found at the time, but the subsequent Tullie House/PAS excavations at the findspot discovered a number of copper and iron objects, a bead and two Roman coins dating to 330–337. The coins were found within the artificial stone feature in which the helmet had been deposited and may have been buried at the same time.|$|E

5|$|Aleph {{was created}} to embody the Shin Megami Tensei II world, which is {{reflected}} in his character design: he has a portable computer and a <b>visor</b> that he controls demons with, and carries swords, guns and armor for use in battle. His computer was designed to look compact, and the <b>visor</b> {{was designed to be}} wireless, to show that the game takes place in the future. Kaneko decided to not give Aleph a personality, partially because he is controlled by the player, and partially because he is portrayed as an artificial being, created by the Center's scientists. Beth and Daleth were designed to look similar to the first Shin Megami Tensei Heroine and Hero, using the colors blue and green, respectively. Lucifer was visually portrayed as an elegant gentleman, as Kaneko saw him as someone who tempts and tries the player, rather than being evil. He designed Lucifer in accordance with portrayals of him as a beautiful twelve-winged angel, but gave him six wings instead, for a total of twelve across his appearances in Shin Megami Tensei and Shin Megami Tensei II.|$|E

5|$|Kieswetter's {{career was}} cut short owing to an injury {{sustained}} while batting for Somerset in July 2014: a ball penetrated the gap between his helmet's grille and <b>visor</b> and struck him in the face, damaging his vision. There was initially some hope of a full recovery and he was named in a provisional England squad for the 2015 Cricket World Cup, but he continued to experience difficulties with his vision. As {{a result of these}} problems, in June 2015, aged 27, he announced his retirement from professional cricket. In 2017, he became a professional golfer.|$|E
5|$|On {{the fourth}} orbit, {{drifting}} in an inverted spacecraft with the Earth 'above' him, Schirra continued his photography and attempted—unsuccessfully—to spot the Echo 1 satellite while passing over East Africa. As he approached California, he spoke briefly to John Glenn in a two-minute conversation broadcast live across the United States {{on radio and}} television. Problems began to recur with the pressure suit, with water condensing on the faceplate; Schirra, concerned about the internal temperature, avoided opening the <b>visor</b> to clean it for fear that the suit temperature would misbehave again.|$|E
5|$|The finder did not {{initially}} realise {{that he had}} found a Roman artefact and thought at first that it was a Victorian ornament. He eventually identified it as Roman by consulting auction catalogues, searching the Internet and getting advice from dealers. Find Liaison Officers from the Portable Antiquities Scheme were notified of the discovery and visited the findspot along with the finder. Christie's commissioned Darren Bradbury, an independent conservator and restorer, to restore the helmet and <b>visor</b> for sale. Although Christie's was asked to delay the restoration so that a full scientific examination could be carried out, this request was not granted and information about the helmet's burial may have been lost as a result. However, the British Museum was able to inspect the find during restoration and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry was carried out to determine the composition of the headpiece, <b>visor</b> and griffin. Bradbury's restoration work took some 240 hours and involved the repair of cracks and holes using resin and cyanoacrylate, retouched to match the appearance of the surrounding material.|$|E

5|$|The helm {{on which}} the crest was borne was {{originally}} a simple steel design, sometimes with gold embellishments. In the reign of Elizabeth I a pattern of helm unique to the Royal Arms was introduced. This is a gold helm with a barred <b>visor,</b> facing the viewer. The decorative mantling (a stylised cloth cloak that hangs from the helm) was originally of red cloth lined with ermine, but was altered to cloth of gold lined ermine by Elizabeth.|$|E
5|$|Tom Pryce's helmet design was, in {{comparison}} to later drivers', simple and restrained. His helmet was plain white all over until 1970. At that year's race at Castle Combe, his father asked Pryce to make his helmet stand out more {{so that he could}} easily identify him in a pack of cars. Pryce added five black vertical lines to his helmet, placed just above his <b>visor.</b> From that time the only change to this design was the addition of a Welsh flag to the side of his helmet in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher's {{original}} helmet sported the colours of the German {{flag and}} his sponsor's decals. On {{the top was}} a blue circle with white astroids. When Jos Verstappen was his teammate, Schumacher added four red diagonal strokes over the <b>visor</b> to differentiate his helmet from his teammate. After Schumacher joined Ferrari a prancing horse was added on the back. From the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix, in order to differentiate his colours from his new teammate Rubens Barrichello, Schumacher changed the upper blue colour {{and some of the}} white areas to red. Since 2004, the helmet sported a white diagonal line with a white vertical line in the zone of the German Flag colours (originally to accommodate sponsor AMD), but then these lines remained in the Suzuka 2006 design.|$|E
