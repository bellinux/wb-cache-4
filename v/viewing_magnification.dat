40|$|Aim Whole slide images (WSIs) have stimulated a {{paradigm}} shift from conventional to digital pathology in several applications within pathology. Due {{to the fact that}} WSIs have not yet been approved for primary diagnostics, validating their use for different diagnostic purposes is still mandatory. The aim {{of this study was to}} test the validity of WSI in assessing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2) status in breast cancer specimens using chromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISH). Materials and methods Ninety-six HER 2 CISH slides were scored by two observers on a light microscope (400 × <b>viewing</b> <b>magnification)</b> and on WSI (40 × scanning magnification, one focus plane) with a minimum of 6 weeks washout period. The concordance between digital and microscopic HER 2 scores was assessed. Results Digitally, 93 / 96 cases could be assessed (96. 8 %). Microscopic and digital evaluation of HER 2 amplification status were concordant in 68 / 93 cases ((73. 1 %, 95 % CI: 0. 639 - 0. 823), ? 0. 588). CISH underscoring was most noticeable in the amplified and equivocal categories while the highest level concordance was seen in cases with a normal copy number. Additionally there was a noticeable tendency to underestimate the average HER 2 scores on WSI: lower in 59 and higher in 11 cases. There was no major difference in time spent for microscopic scoring (86. 9 s) and digital scoring (81. 7 s). Conclusions There was a reasonable concordance between microscopic scoring and WSI-based scoring of HER 2 copy number of CISH slides. Nevertheless, WSIs scanned on a single focal plane are insufficient to assess HER 2 gene amplification status by scoring CISH due to the noticeable tendency towards digitally underestimating the number of HER 2 spots. Scanning at multiple focus planes may offer better resolution for improved digital CISH spot counting...|$|E

50|$|Some words {{common in}} spectroscopy, optical {{microscopy}} and photography have been adapted or their scope modified {{for their use}} in chemical imaging. They include: resolution, field of <b>view</b> and <b>magnification.</b> There {{are two types of}} resolution in chemical imaging. The spectral resolution refers to the ability to resolve small energy differences; it applies to the spectral axis. The spatial resolution is the minimum distance between two objects that is required for them to be detected as distinct objects. The spatial resolution is influenced by the field of view, a physical measure {{of the size of the}} area probed by the analysis. In imaging, the field of view is a product of the magnification and the number of pixels in the detector array. The magnification is a ratio of the physical area of the detector array divided by the area of the sample field of <b>view.</b> Higher <b>magnifications</b> for the same detector image a smaller area of the sample.|$|R
