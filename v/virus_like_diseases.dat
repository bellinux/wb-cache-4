As {{a result of}} the study, some virus-free grapefruit varieties (Redblush, Rio Red, Ray Ruby, Henderson, Star Ruby and Marsh Seedless) budded on Local sour orange and Troyer citrange rootstocks were planted at breeding parcel in 1995.

Local sour orange and Troyer citrange affected similarly on the fruit quality of grapefruit cultivars. It could be suggested that these rootstocks could be recommended for grapefruit growing...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{problems}} during cultivation of ornamental plants arising from diseases and pests. Viral borne pathogens, among these diseases, have a distinctive importance {{compared to other}} plant diseases due to their easy mechanical transmission from plant to plant, their rapid spreading ability by means of seeds, vegetative material and vector insects {{and the absence of}} a chemical control method. Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) is one of these virus diseases. CMV is the second virus after tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) over {{the world in terms of}} the number of hosts. In this study, presence of CMV was investigated in ornamental bulbous plants (daffodils, hyacinths, lilies) in Çanakkale province and its districts. For this purpose, 128 bulbous ornamental plant samples showing <b>virus</b> and <b>virus</b> <b>like</b> <b>disease</b> symptoms were collected in field studies performed between the years 2012 - 2015. The collected samples were tested for the presence of CMV using serological and molecular methods with DAS-ELISA and RT-PCR, respectively. Twenty-nine out of 128 samples (% 22. 65) were found to be infected with CMV. Chlorosis was observed throughout veins and light mosaics were observed to be the most common symptoms in CMV infected plants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The role of {{migrating}} {{wild birds}} in transmitting diseases of poultry or zoonoses is a contentious issue as the researchers and naturalists stands divided regarding their capability to disperse pathogens over continents. Recently, migratory birds got world wide attention during the bird flu outbreaks, {{as they were}} found capable to disseminate the deadly H 5 N 1 avian influenza (bird flu) virus, without themselves getting affected. However, the death of migratory birds due to H 5 N 1, reported from Asia, has fuelled anxiety and concern over the whole issue. Apart from avian influenza, migratory birds are also thought to play role in the transmission of avian <b>viruses</b> <b>like</b> Newcastle <b>disease</b> <b>virus,</b> avian pneumovirus and duck plague virus. Similarly, bacterial pathogens like Chlamydophila psittaci and Pasteurella multocida can be transmitted to domestic poultry via migratory birds. They are also known to spread West Nile virus, equine encephalitis virus, Borrelia burgdorferi and enteropathogens like Campylobacter and Salmonella, which could affect animals as will as human beings. To prevent such etiological agents from entering poultry premises, strict biosecurity and constant surveillance are of paramount importance. Hence, in the scenario of migratory birds contributing significantly to the global spread of infectious diseases, {{a better understanding of}} their role in the disease epidemiology has to be gained by implementing superior surveillance and tracking strategies...|$|R

40|$|As many as 39 plant samples {{representing}} {{nine different}} botanical families, showing symptoms <b>like</b> <b>virus</b> <b>diseases,</b> {{were collected from}} different locations of Bangladesh in 1986 - X 7. The samples were preserved at 4 °C after drying by lyophilization or over calcium chloride. Double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) and dot-immunobinding assay (DIBA) were applied for serological detection of viruses by using 11 different antiivirus-sera. Many of the samples (28 / 39) showed positive reaction with either of the antisera used. In all eight different viruses, such as tobacco mosaic virus-ordinary strain (TMVOM), turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), broad bean wilt virus (BBWV), Shallot latent virus (SLV), leek yellow stripe virus (LYSV), tobacco rattle virus (TRV), papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) and mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV) were serologically detected. Among these, mixed infection of SLV and LYSV were detected from garlic sample. Mixed infection of TuMV and BBWV were also detected from the sample of Chinese cabbage. TMVOM {{were found to be}} common in various plant species while PRSV, TuMV, TRV, MYMV and both SLV and LYSV were detected from each of papaya, Chinese cabbage, lettuce, okra and garlic samples, respectively. The results suggest that the dried samples stored for 2 - 3 years retained antigenicity of the viruses which could be detected by serological methods like DIBA and DASELISA...|$|R
