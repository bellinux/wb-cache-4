5000|$|Land seismic surveys tend to {{be large}} entities, {{requiring}} hundreds of tons of equipment and employing anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand people, deployed over vast areas for many months. [...] There {{are a number of}} options available for a controlled seismic source in a land survey and particularly common choices are <b>Vibroseis</b> and dynamite. <b>Vibroseis</b> is a non-impulsive source that is cheap and efficient but requires flat ground to operate on, making its use more difficult in undeveloped areas. The method comprises one or more heavy, all-terrain vehicles lowering a steel plate onto the ground, which is then vibrated with a specific frequency distribution and amplitude. [...] It produces a low energy density, allowing it to be used in cities and other built-up areas where dynamite would cause significant damage, though the large weight attached to a <b>Vibroseis</b> truck can cause its own environmental damage. [...] Dynamite is an impulsive source that is regarded as the ideal geophysical source due to it producing an almost perfect impulse function but it has obvious environmental drawbacks. For a long time, it was the only seismic source available until weight dropping was introduced around 1954, allowing geophysicists to make a trade-off between image quality and environmental damage. Compared to <b>Vibroseis,</b> dynamite is also operationally inefficient because each source point needs to be drilled and the dynamite placed in the hole.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Mobil Oil Corporation was granted {{exploration}} rights on the island. Both explosive and <b>vibroseis</b> exploration methods were used. Extensive surveys and geological maps {{were made at}} that time.|$|E
50|$|The low {{frequency}} seismic field {{is not usually}} reachable by the active seismic surveys being either the explosive waves mainly in the high frequency and the <b>vibroseis</b> currently built not to reach such a low frequencies.|$|E
50|$|Seismic {{exploration}} {{involves the}} use of low frequency sound (< 100 Hz) to probe deep into the seabed. Despite the relatively poor resolution due to their long wavelength, low frequency sounds are preferred because high frequencies are heavily attenuated when they travel through the seabed. Sound sources used include airguns, <b>vibroseis</b> and explosives.|$|E

An advantage of the thumper (later shared with <b>Vibroseis),</b> especially in politically unstable areas, is that no explosives are required.|$|E
50|$|Seismic surveys {{involve the}} {{generation}} of sound waves to measure underground structures. Source waves are generally created by percussion mechanisms located near the ground or water surface, typically dropped weights, <b>vibroseis</b> trucks, or explosives. Data are collected with geophones, then stored and processed by computer. Current technology allows {{the generation of}} 3D images of underground rock structures using such equipment.|$|E

50|$|Reflection {{seismology}} (or seismic reflection) is {{a method}} of exploration geophysics that uses the principles of seismology to estimate {{the properties of the}} Earth's subsurface from reflected seismic waves. The method requires a controlled seismic source of energy, such as dynamite/Tovex blast, a specialized air gun or a seismic vibrator, commonly known by the trademark name <b>Vibroseis.</b> Reflection seismology is similar to sonar and echolocation. This article is about surface seismic surveys; for vertical seismic profiles, see VSP.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{in marine}} seismic surveys, land {{geometries}} {{are not limited}} to narrow paths of acquisition, meaning that a wide range of offsets and azimuths is usually acquired and the largest challenge is increasing the rate of acquisition. The rate of production is obviously controlled by how fast the source (<b>Vibroseis</b> in this case) can be fired and then {{move on to the next}} source location. Attempts have been made to use multiple seismic sources at the same time in order to increase survey efficiency and a successful example of this technique is Independent Simultaneous Sweeping (ISS).|$|E

50|$|The general {{principle}} of seismic reflection {{is to send}} elastic waves (using an energy source such as dynamite explosion or <b>Vibroseis)</b> into the Earth, where each layer within the Earth reflects {{a portion of the}} wave’s energy back and allows the rest to refract through. These reflected energy waves are recorded over a predetermined time period (called the record length) by receivers that detect the motion of the ground in which they are placed. On land, the typical receiver used is a small, portable instrument known as a geophone, which converts ground motion into an analogue electrical signal. In water, hydrophones are used, which convert pressure changes into electrical signals. Each receiver’s response to a single shot is known as a “trace” and is recorded onto a data storage device, then the shot location is moved along and the process is repeated. Typically, the recorded signals are subjected to significant amounts of signal processing before they are ready to be interpreted and this is an area of significant active research within industry and academia. In general, the more complex the geology of the area under study, the more sophisticated are the techniques required to remove noise and increase resolution. Modern seismic reflection surveys contain large amount of data and so require large amounts of computer processing, often performed on supercomputers or computer clusters.|$|E
40|$|We have {{observed}} that <b>Vibroseis</b> wavelets behave very much {{as if they are}} minimum phase. This was discovered by applying minimum-phase Wiener deconvolution to the separated <b>vibroseis</b> VSP downgoing waves and observing that the result is effectively a band-limited spike. Motivated by this finding, we simulated a synthetic nonstationary <b>vibroseis</b> wavelet in a constant-Q medium by nonstationary convolution and again we found it to be close to minimum phase. Furthermore, we applied minimum-phase Gabor deconvolution to the sweep-removed <b>vibroseis</b> record and correlated <b>vibroseis</b> data. We obtained very similar results from these two approaches. For the synthetic data, the deconvolved traces from both approaches are consistent with the input reflectivity. For a real shot gather, there are few differences between the deconvolved gathers from these two methods. These comparisons further confirm that the nonstationary wavelet embedded in the correlated surface <b>vibroseis</b> seismic data is approximately minimum phase...|$|E
40|$|The FM signals, called sweeps, {{used in the}} <b>Vibroseis</b> {{method of}} seismic {{exploration}} show {{a considerable amount of}} energy in the sidelobes after correlation detection. These sidelobes represent signal generated noise and if not kept low in amplitude they miggit mask subsequent reflections, thereby reducing the detection capability of the <b>Vibroseis</b> system. The purpose of this research has been to investigate new coded signal design techniques for the use with <b>Vibroseis,</b> in order to achieve sidelobe suppression. Some of the codes examined have already been known to radar and communication theory, whilst some codes are original developments of this research exercise. Binary and quaternary complementary series are found to be especially suitable for a <b>Vibroseis</b> encoding technique. A new and simple algorithm for the generation of quaternary series from known binary complementary sequences is given and the concept of correlation matrices is introduced to complementary series, permitting signal design in the detection window. The encoded <b>Vibroseis</b> input signals were tested on a computer and showed perfect sidelobe suppression a certain distance away from the main compressed pulse, when detected by a matched filter. Field tests with the coded signals were conducted, taking advantage of a computerized <b>Vibroseis</b> field system. The tests showed promising results. However, {{it became clear that the}} vibrator control devices will have to be adjusted to the transmission of such sophisti cated signals, in order to allow substantially better results than in the conventional <b>Vibroseis</b> system. A ‘Continuous <b>Vibroseis</b> Transmission System’ is suggested, transmitting energy during the normal listening period. Such a system has been developed witht h help of so-called ‘Mutually-Orthogonal-Complementay Sets of Sequences’ and although not yet practically tested its anticipated advantages and disadvantages are described. Finally, ‘Predistortion’ as a method of <b>Vibroseis</b> signal design is examined. Providing the correct predestortion parameters are chosen, the signal-to-correlation noise ratio an be increased. A spectrum whitening effect observed an addition of selected perdistorted sweeps can be of advantage in a quaternary comlementary coded Viboseis system, permitting an optimal wavelet design in the detection window...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} of <b>Vibroseis</b> {{deconvolution}} has been recently {{proposed by the}} authors. This discussion describes the effects of noise on the application of this method. The initial deconvolution step involves estimating the spectrum of the <b>Vibroseis</b> wavelet by homomorphic filtering. It is shown that noise causes problems with phase estimation. Hence, the <b>Vibroseis</b> wavelet {{is assumed to be}} zero phase. Examples demonstrate that zero phase cepstral filtering is a robust wavelet estimation approach for noisy data. The second step of the deconvolution method forms an impulse response model by a spectral extension method.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the Apennine CROP- 04 seismic data {{has been carried out}} to understand the causes of a very poor field data quality and then to guide possible re-processing efforts. We study both the <b>vibroseis</b> recordings and the few explosive data available and we compare the signal to noise ratio of the seismic signals with either the employed acquisition parameters and the geology and topography at the surface. The geological complexity of the area with the many tectonic disturbances associated with the thrusting and the faulting causes a diffused wave-field scattering that degrades the S/N ratio of both the <b>vibroseis</b> and the explosive recordings. However we found additional problems, especially for the <b>vibroseis</b> data. In fact, the <b>vibroseis</b> source does not insure the necessary penetration of the seismic signal and in several recordings yields first breaks that are difficult to pick due to the precursors. This constitutes a problem for refraction statics computation. The excessively long receiver spread is not appropriate to the rapid variations of the surface lithologies, that cause abrupt velocity changes, and of the topographic elevations along the profile. When strong surface wave noise is present, the receiver group interval does not appear to fulfil the necessary sampling requirements and thus severe aliasing effects are encountered. The high tortuosity of segments of the field layout, also due to the location of the <b>vibroseis</b> trucks along the available mountain roads, renders troublesome the CMP gathering operation during the processing phase. Finally, the presence on the <b>vibroseis</b> data of a significant amount of noisy traces, especially at far offsets, strongly biases the overall quality of the dataset...|$|E

The center survey line was also surveyed with explosives and compared with the <b>Vibroseis</b> data.

40|$|Explosive seismic {{reflection}} {{data from}} Halvfarryggen, a 910 m thick local ice {{dome of the}} Antarctic ice sheet, show numerous laterally continuous reflections within the ice between 300 and 870 m depth. We compare the quality of data obtained with explosive sources with that obtained using a <b>vibroseis</b> source for detecting englacial reflections with a snowstreamer, and investigate the origin of englacial reflections. We find <b>vibroseis</b> in combination with a snowstreamer is ten times more productive than explosive seismics. However, englacial reflections are more clearly visible with explosives, which have a broader bandwidth signature, than the <b>vibroseis,</b> which is band-limited at the high-frequency end to 100 Hz. Only the strongest and deepest englacial reflection is detected with <b>vibroseis.</b> We interpret the majority of englacial reflections to originate from changes in the crystal orientation fabric in closely spaced layers, less than the vibro-seismic tuning thickness of 13. 5 m. Phase analysis of the lowermost englacial reflector, 40 m above the bed, indicates {{a sharp increase in}} seismic wave speed. We interpret this reflector as a transition to a vertical single-maximum fabric.

40|$|Due to the {{character}} of the original source materials and the nature of batch digitization, quality control issues may be present in this document. Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The detection of geologic reflectors in seismic signals requires sufficient dynamic range in the recording instruments to measure a small signal accurately {{in the presence of a}} large signal or in the presence of noise. For non-redundant signals, the dynamic range is directly affected by the numbers of bits used in the digitization. However, for redundunt signals such as <b>Vibroseis,</b> the dynamic range is a function of the sweep duration (number of samples), the number of (fixed) source repetitions, and the number of traces in a common-depth point (CDP) stacking because the individual samples of a redundant signal are combined in generating the fmal seismic section. Therefore, it is not necessary to have the full dynamic range and precision in the raw data to achieve the desired quality of the final section. Hence, the recording instruments need not utilize more binary bits than required to achieve the desired dynamic range. The effects of digitization of <b>Vibroseis</b> signals using 16, 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1 bit on: 1) the dynamic range, 2) the S/N ratio, and 3) the input/output relationship were investigated. The nature of degradation of the digitized <b>Vibroseis</b> signals varied with the number of bits used. The <b>Vibroseis</b> method increased the dynamic range and the small-signal delectability. However, these two properties were reduced as the number of bits was decreased. The S/N ratio was also improved. The input/output (I/O) relation changed from a stair-step like (nonlinear) to a sight line as the number of bits increased. In the presence of gaussian noise however, it is shown that, for sign-bit and 2 -bit digitizations, the 1 / 0 relation approximated a straight line provided that the noise standard deviation is larger than the signal (i. e., S/N<I. O) because noise provided a background that randomized the digitization distortion. However, sufficient redundancy (i. e., many signals must be averaged) is required to control the amount of noise present. Overlapping <b>Vibroseis</b> signals also showed that they acted like noise for each other which drastically reduced the digitization distortion of both signals which occurs in the absence of noise. The 8 -bit digitization of <b>Vibroseis</b> signals showed comparable and acceptable results compared with the 16 -bit digitization. With an 8 -bit digitizes, small <b>Vibroseis</b> signals with amplitudes of- 54 dB relative to the primary signals were recovered in the presence of another strong signal (primary) and/or in the presence of large noise...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experimental}} seismic {{surveys were}} collected in the 1991 LITHOPROBE Trans-Hudson Orogen (THO) data acquisition program. The purpose of the coincident dynamite and <b>vibroseis</b> reflection surveys was to compare crustal images obtained using high-fold low-energy and low-fold high-energy sources. On single-fold field records, signal amplitudes from explosive sources are consistently 50 dB higher than on the corresponding <b>vibroseis</b> records. The <b>vibroseis</b> final stack exhibits better defined upper-crustal reflectivity due primarily to the higher fold. However, at lower-crustal and Moho levels, the dynamite data provides images which are equal or superior to those obtained from the <b>vibroseis</b> data. The dynamite source not only allowed deeper signal penetration but also succeeded in mapping {{of a number of}} subcrustal reflections not identified in previous <b>vibroseis</b> data. These new seismic images indicate that the crustal root is not simple depression on the upper-mantle as was inferred initially but a broad (3 s) zone of reflectivity that dips west and extends more than 10 km below the younger regional Moho. Moreover, the dynamite data also indicates that diffraction patterns, detected at lower crustal and Moho depths, have large apertures which permitted proper migration of these lower crustal events. Four <b>vibroseis</b> expanding spread profiles (ESP) were also acquired during the data acquisition program to obtain more detailed and accurate velocity structure. These profiles, with a maximum offset of 18 km, were centered on areas where prominent crustal reflectivity was detected by the regional <b>vibroseis</b> survey. The small source stepout distance (100 m) generated high-fold (> 30) data. Extensive modeling was carried out to estimate the offset range within which each traveltime approximation and velocity analysis technique may be implemented. The results reveal that velocity estimation becomes more robust and accurate when crustal seismic surveys utilize longer offsets than commonly used. These larger source-receiver separations, however, must be generally limited to offset/depth ratios not exceeding 1. 5 when conventional velocity analysis techniques, based on the hyperbolic moveout assumptions, are implemented. Besides the semblance method two velocity estimators adapted to crustal studies, namely the covariance and the τ - p techniques, were tried. The former yielded the highest resolution followed by the semblance and the τ - p methods. Resolution of the semblance estimator for a maximum offset of 36 km is equal to that of the covariance method with a corresponding offset of 18 km for mid-crustal reflectors. The advantages provided by the long-offset data acquisition include increased S/N ratio and a greater number of traces with sufficiently large moveouts whichimproved velocity resolution, especially below mid-crustal depths. To achieve similar advantages in a regional crustal reflection survey would require the adoption of longer spread lengths than those presently implemented in standard data acquisition procedures...|$|E

40|$|The <b>vibroseis</b> method must be {{extended}} to its limits as the search {{for oil and gas}} continues on land. To successfully improve <b>vibroseis</b> data quality, it is crucial to evaluate each element in the <b>vibroseis</b> data acquisition system and ensure that the contribution from each element is successful. <b>Vibroseis</b> systems depend greatly upon the ability of vibrators to generate synchronous, repeatable ground-force sweeps over a broad frequency range. This requires that the reaction mass and the baseplate of the vibrator move as rigid bodies. However, rigid-body motion is not completely true for high- frequency vibrations, especially for the vibrator baseplate. In order to accurately understand the motion of the vibrator baseplate, a finite element analysis model of the vibrator baseplate and the coupled ground has been developed. This model is useful for simulating the vibrator baseplate dynamics, evaluating the impact of the baseplate on the coupled ground and vibrator baseplate design. Model data demonstrate that the vibrator baseplate and its stilt structure are subject to six significant resonant frequencies in the range of 10 – 80 Hz. Due to the low rigidity of the baseplate, the baseplate stilt structure experiences severe rocking motions at lower frequencies and the baseplate pad experiences severe flexing motions at higher frequencies. Flexing motions cause partial decoupling, which gives rise to increased levels of harmonic distortion and less useable signal energy. In general, the baseplate pad suffers more bending and flexing motions at high frequencies than low frequencies, leading less efficiency in transmitting the useable energy into the ground...|$|E

By using an approach which is consistent with the principle of maximum entropy, the undetermined portions of the seismogram's Fourier transform can be filled in by autoregressive prediction. The process of initially deconvolving in a restricted passband reduces the enhancement of noise contaminated parts of the spectrum, and the spectral extension scheme increases the time domain resolution of the process...|$|E
