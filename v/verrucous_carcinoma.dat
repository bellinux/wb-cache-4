A total of 69 potentially malig-nant oral lesions (leukoplakias with mild, moderate or severe dysplasia), 90 OSCCs (well-, moderately and poorly differ-entiated), eight oral <b>verrucous</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and 29 fibrous hyperplasias were examined for the presence of myofibro-blasts using immunohistochemical detection of isoform α of smooth muscle actin.

40|$|Background. This study aims {{to compare}} the {{alterations}} in the methylation profiles of E-cadherin in oral cancer, especially in tumors with lowest metatastic potential. Methods. Nine oral <b>verrucous</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (VCs), 20 oral well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas without lymph node involvement (SCC-pNO), and 17 with lymph node involvement (SCC-pN+) were analyzed using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical expression of E-cadherin gene. Results. The immunohistochemical expression of E-cadherin in VC was significantly higher (p =. 016) when compared with SCC-pNO and SCC-pN+ groups. The E-cadherin gene methylation was not correlated with its abnormal immunohistochemical expression in VC and SCC-pNO. All tumors of the SCC-pN+ group with unmethylated E-cadherin gene showed significant loss of E-cadherin immunoexpression (p =. 044). Conclusions. The E-cadherin gene methylation presence in tumors with lowest invasive and metastatic potential, such as VC, suggests the early involvement of this epigenetic event in the multistep progression of the oral carcinogenesis.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the patterns of}} expression of {{transforming growth factor alpha}} (TGF-alpha) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in squamous metaplasia and squamous cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder with and without schistosomiasis. METHODS: Immunohistochemical study of the expression of TGF-alpha and EGFR in squamous metaplasias (n = 12) and various grades of squamous cell carcinomas (n = 21) of the bladder with and without schistosomiasis. RESULTS: Focal cytoplasmic and membranous positivity for EGFR and TGF-alpha was seen in all cases of squamous metaplasia. The markers were diffusely coexpressed in a concordant pattern in areas of hyperplastic keratinising squamous metaplasia. A similar pattern of positivity was seen in <b>verrucous</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (n = 2) and well differentiated squamous carcinomas (n = 6). Progressive loss of differentiation was associated with increasing loss of EGFR staining while TGF-alpha staining was retained. Squamous cell carcinoma in situ (n = 2) showed focal positivity for TGF-alpha and EGFR. There were no differences in staining patterns between cases with and without schistosomiasis. CONCLUSIONS: The coexpression of TGF-alpha and EGFR by well differentiated squamous cell carcinomas and hyperplastic keratinising squamous metaplasia is consistent with the active regulatory role exerted by this autocrine loop. There is regional absence of expression of EGFR but not of TGF-alpha in squamous cell carcinomas of lesser differentiation, suggesting heterogeneity of such control in these tumours. The focal expression of the two markers in squamous cell carcinomas in situ indicates a possible second pathway of oncogenesis for less differentiated tumours.

40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} whether Ki- 67 immunoexpression in penile {{squamous cell carcinoma}} (PSCC) has a prognostic value and correlates with lymph node metastasis, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and patient survival. Methods: 148 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded PSCC samples were tissue-microarrayed, including 97 usual-type SCCs, 17 basaloid, 15 pure <b>verrucous</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> 2 warty and 17 mixed-type tumours. All samples were immunostained for Ki- 67 protein. HPV DNA was detected with INNO-LiPA assay. Follow-up data were available for 134 patients. Results: Ki- 67 was strongly expressed in 57 / 148 (38. 5 %) of PSCCs. Different cancer subtypes showed significant difference in Ki- 67 expression (p < 0. 0001) with highest positivity in basaloid, 16 / 17 (94 %), followed by usual type, 38 / 97 (39 %) and lack of Ki- 67 positive cases within verrucous tumours, 0 / 15. Ki- 67 positively correlated with high-risk HPV (p < 0. 0001) and showed good specificity (84 %) but low sensitivity (61 %) for high-risk HPV detection. Ki- 67 protein strongly positively correlated with tumour grade (p < 0. 0001) but not with stage (p= 0. 2193), or lymph node status (p= 0. 7366). Ki- 67 showed no prognostic value for cancer-specific survival (HR= 1. 00, 95 %, CI 0. 99 to 1. 02, p= 0. 54) or overall survival (HR= 1. 00, 95 %, CI 0. 99 to 1. 02, p= 0. 45). High tumour stage, lymph node metastasis, high tumour grade and age at diagnosis were all independent prognostic factors for cancer-specific survival and overall survival. Conclusions: Ki- 67 is only a moderate surrogate marker for HPV infection in PSCC. It does not show prognostic value for cancer-specific survival and overall survival in PSCC.

Evaluation of survival, recurrence and larynx preservation rates. Study centresCLCC François-Baclesse and CHU de Caen. PatientsFifty-nine patients (53 men and sixwomen) treated for glottic cancer (57 squamous cell <b>carcinomas,</b> two <b>verrucous</b> <b>carcinomas)</b> comprising 51 T 1 N 0 M 0 and eight T 2 N 0 M 0 tumours. Treatment with exclusive radiotherapy (mean dose of 70 Grays limited to the thyroid cartilage for 57 patients, with lymph node irradiation for two patients). ResultsIn this series, five (9. 8 %) patients with stage T 1 N 0 M 0 glottic cancer and three patients (37. 5 %) with stage T 2 N 0 M 0 glottic cancer relapsed, corresponding to a global recurrence rate of 13. 6 %. Three of the eight recurrences involved lymph nodes exclusively (N), two patients relapsed exclusively at the primary tumour site (T) and three patients presented local and lymph node recurrence (T and N). Treatment consisted of salvage total laryngectomy with bilateral cervical lymph node dissection in three cases, bilateral cervical lymph node dissection and sensitized radiotherapy in two cases, exclusive chemotherapy in one case, cervical lymph node dissection and cervical radiotherapy in one case.

40|$|Magister Scientiae Dentium - MSc(Dent) Background: Reports on {{the global}} {{incidence}} of oral neoplasms indicate reduced data from Africa. Population based studies of oral cancer in Sudan and other regions of Africa are scarce. Oral cancer in Sudan constitutes a serious health problem, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most prevalent type of oral malignancy. There are descriptive epidemiologic studies from Sudan that have reported high a frequency rate of oral cancer in Sudanese males, linking this high incidence to Toombak, a product of oral snuff mixed with sodium bicarbonate (Idris et al, 1995 (b)), but to date no population-based studies of oral cancer incidence in Sudan have been performed or published. Title: Epidemiology of Oral Malignancy in Sudan (2004 - 2008). Aims and Objectives: The objectives {{of the study were}} to analyse the pattern of distribution and to determine the minimum age standardized incidence rates (ASIR) and the cumulative (lifetime) risk (CR) of oral & lip squamous cell carcinoma / oral malignancy by site, age and gender for the 5 -year period 2004 - 2008. Methods: The records of patients with oral & maxillofacial and salivary malignancies (OMFS) referred to Khartoum Dental Teaching Hospital (KDTH) and the population census data were accessioned. Data was captured using Microsoft Excel 2007 ® and the ASIRs for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) were calculated using the direct International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) method. These results were compared with the on-line global cancer statistics database (GLOBOCAN -WHO/IARC) for 2008 and 2012. Records of oral cancer cases during the period of the study were obtained from KDTH. The information included in the raw data collected were the file number for patient identification, year of diagnosis, age, sex, site of the lesion, histological diagnosis, the International Classification of Diseases- 10 (ICD 10) codes, the referring unit and the state from which the patient was referred. The population data for the years of the study and the five age group stratifications was obtained from the Central Statistical Office in Khartoum, Sudan. The data was analysed using Microsoft Excel, 2007 ®. Age standardized incidence rate of oral & lip squamous cell carcinoma/ oral malignancy was calculated using the direct IARC method. Results: Of the total Sudanese population of 36. 3 million in 2006, 649 OMFS malignancies (M:F= 1. 44 : 1) were captured at KDTH during the 5 -year period; 390 (M:F= 1. 67 : 1) were (intra) oral squamous cancers (OSCC) and <b>verrucous</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (VC). The ASIR for OSCC/VC in Sudan was calculated as 3. 19 for males and 1. 83 for females (M:F= 1. 74 : 1), however the pooled ASIR in the Khartoum and Gezira States was 30 % higher for males (4. 21) and 14 % higher for females (2. 09, M:F= 2. 01 : 1). The incidence over the 5 years of separately recorded lip SCC/VC in Sudanese males was 26 and 8 for females (M:F= 3. 25 : 1). The ASIRs of combined oral & lip SCC/VC in Sudanese males was 3. 45 and 1. 88 for females (M:F= 1. 84 : 1). These compare relatively well with the GLOBOCAN data which estimates a slightly lower ASIR of 3. 3 for males and somewhat higher ASIR of 2. 1 for females (M:F= 1. 57 : 1). The cumulative (lifetime) risk (CR 0 - 74) of developing oral and lip cancer was 1 : 182 for males compared to 1 : 831 for females. For oral cancer (excluding lip), the CR was almost similar for males (1 : 181); while females showed a markedly higher CR (1 : 344). Conclusion: The combined ASIRs of oral & lip SCC/VC from the Khartoum and Gezira states differed from the ASIRs calculated for the entire Sudan and from the GLOBOCAN estimates. The recording of cancer incidence data can vary according to the (incorrect) labelling of anatomical locations and diagnosis.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Laryngeal <b>verrucous</b> {{squamous}} cell <b>carcinoma</b> (VSCC) {{is a highly}} differentiated {{squamous cell}} carcinoma (SCC), the diagnosis of which can meet with many pitfalls: benign hyperplastic lesions and conventional SCC {{are the most important}} differential diagnoses. The microRNA miR- 19 a is overexpressed in many solid tumours and regulates the suppressor of cytokine signalling- 1 (SOCS- 1) expression. AIMS: The main endpoints were to assess miR- 19 a and SOCS- 1 expression in glottic VSCC, and the former's potential role in differentiating between glottic VSCC, conventional SCC and hyperplastic lesions. METHODS: The expression of MiR- 19 a (by reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR) and SOCS- 1 (by immunohistochemistry, rabbit polyclonal anti-SOCS- 1 antibody) was assessed in 11 consecutive cases of glottic VSCC, 20 of papillary hyperplasia and 42 cases of conventional SCC. RESULTS: Mean miR- 19 a expression was significantly higher (p= 0. 000) in malignant glottic lesions (conventional SCC/VSCC) than in benign conditions. Significant differences in mean miR- 19 a expression also emerged between conventional SCC and papillary hyperplasia (p= 0. 000), and between conventional SCC and VSCC (p= 0. 03). miR- 19 a expression was not statistically associated with SOCS- 1 immunoreactivity or immunostaining intensity in VSCC, conventional SCC or papillary hyperplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary outcomes suggest the utility of miR- 19 a in the challenging differential diagnosis of laryngeal VSCC. Although miR- 19 a has been found to regulate SOCS- 1 expression, this evidence was not confirmed by this investigation. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

While other physicians such as Ernst von Bergmann suggested surgical removal of the entire larynx, Virchow was opposed to it because no successful operation of such kind had ever been done. The British surgeon, Morell Mackenzie, performed a biopsy in 1887 and sent it to Virchow, who identified them as [...] "pachydermia verrucosa laryngis". Virchow affirmed that the tissues were not cancerous, even after several biopsy tests. The Kaiser died on 15 June 1888. The next day a post-mortem examination was performed by Virchow and his assistant. They found that the larynx was extensively damaged due to ulcer, and microscopic examination confirmed epidermal carcinoma. Die Krankheit Kaiser Friedrich des Dritten (The Medical Report of Kaiser Frederick III) was published on 11 July under the lead authorship of Bergmann. But Virchow and Mackenzie were omitted, and they were particularly criticised for all their works. The arguments between them turned into a century-long controversy, resulting in Virchow being accused of misdiagnosis and malpractice. But reassessment of the diagnostic history revealed that Virchow was right in his findings and decisions.

The aims of this study were to compare the distribution of different histological subtypes of PSCC from regions of low (Paraguay, 144 cases) and high (USA, 157 cases) incidence and to identify and compare tumors with and without warty and/or basaloid morphology. The distribution of subtypes in the Paraguayan and the American series was: usual, 49. 3 and 46. 5 %; verrucous, 8. 3 and 7. 6 %; papillary NOS, 7. 6 and 5. 7 %; warty, 6. 9 and 8. 3 %; basaloid, 4. 2 and 7. 0 %; sarcomatoid, 0. 7 and 0. 6 %; adenosquamous, 3. 5 and 0. 6 %; and mixed, 19. 4 and 23. 6 %, respectively. The distribution of mixed PSCC was: warty-basaloid, 50. 0 and 59. 5 %; usual-verrucous, 21. 4 and 21. 6 %; usual-warty, 14. 3 and 8. 1 %; usual-basaloid, 7. 1 and 0. 0 %; usual-papillary, 3. 6 and 5. 4 %; and others, 3. 6 and 5. 4 %, respectively.

In the uterine cervix it appears mainly in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, 1, 2 whereas vulvar involvement is observed mainly in younger women. 3 Warty carcinoma of the anus and oral mucosa {{has been reported in}} younger, immunosuppressed men. 4, 5 To the 3 recently published cases in the cervix 2 we would like to add 1 of our recent cases of metastatic warty carcinoma (4 cm in diameter) of the cervix in a 55 -year-old woman who died 8 months after Wertheim 9 ̆ 2 s operation and palliative therapy. Similar to the descriptions by Ng and coworkers, 2 the initial thin-layer preparations showed bizarre-shaped, dyskeratotic tumor cells and koilocytes with extreme nuclear atypia (Figure 1 A). Histologic examination of 6 tumor specimens from the same patient (including initial excision of the exophytic primary cervical tumor, cervical biopsies at the 2 and 11 o 9 ̆ 2 clock positions, left paraovarian metastasis, pouch of Douglas metastasis and right paratubal metastasis) showed the classic features of papillary architecture (Figure 1 B), stromal invasion (Figure 1 C) and koilocytic cytopathic change with extreme atypia (Figure 1 D). According to the literature, there is a close association of this particular morphology with infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes, particularly type 16. 1, 2, 4 - 6 Using in situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization as well as an immunohistochemical technique, Cho and coworkers 1 found multiple HPV types (6, 11, 16, 33) in the same lesion in 6 of 9 warty carcinomas of the cervix and stated that a high incidence of multiple- virus infection appeared to be another characteristic of warty carcinoma. In the 2 Ng et al cases 2 and in the present case, the amount of HPV L 1 gene amplimers produced by PGMY 09 / MY 11 primers in the thin-layer specimen was not sufficient for further HPV genotyping. However, in each of the 6 paraffin-embedded tumor specimens, molecular analysis by PCR using PGMY 09 /MY 11 and L 1 C 1 /C 2 primers, 7, 8 followed by direct sequencing (examinations done in 2 laboratories), detected exclusively HPV type 6 (Figure 1 E). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of metastatic warty carcinoma of the cervix associated with a single, low-risk HPV type, 6. Similar observations have been made in rare cases of warty carcinoma of the bladder and showed an association with a single, low-risk HPV type, 11. 9, 10 In a recent study with pooled data from 11 case-control studies from 9 countries on the HPV prevalence in classic SCC of the cervix, a total of 8, 550 SCC cases were included. There was a single SCC case in which HPV 6 could be identified. 11 Generally, single, low risk-HPV types are only rarely associated with high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or cancer. 1 As compared with conventional SCC, warty carcinoma tends to follow a less aggressive clinical course. However, in contrast to previous reports of warty carcinoma, 3 the behavior of the case presented here was more aggressive. Detailed prognostic studies, however, are lacking due to the rarity of the tumor. 2 Additional risk factors were not known in the present case; a postmortem examination was not done. Different studies reported the contribution of additional factors to the risk of cervical cancer in HPV carriers, such as number of sexual partners, age at first intercourse and promiscuous partners, which should be viewed as an association with sexual transmission of HPV, whereas oral contraceptives and smoking appear to be true cofactors. 12, 13 The literature, however, is not fully consistent on these cofactors. In addition, specific histologic subtypes of penile cancer, basaloid and warty, are frequently associated with HPV; however, only a subset of keratinizing and <b>verrucous</b> penile <b>carcinoma</b> is positive for HPV DNA, and thus these 2 tumor groups seem to develop along different pathogenetic pathways. 14 Further research is needed to understand the complexity of the relationship between HPV infection, coexisting host risk factors and morphology revealed by conventional cytology and histolog...|$|R
