40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> (TAs) in a town situated in the North-East England between 2010 and 2012. I was motivated {{to carry out the}} research by one fundamental question “How do <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> support <b>teaching</b> and learning and, in doing so help create an inclusive environment?” The aims of this holistic, qualitative study were to investigate and clarify, through the lens of <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants,</b> how learning was supported and inclusion facilitated. Using a qualitative approach to examine this question, the study includes a theoretical literature review and empirical field work. The fieldwork consists of semi-structured interviews with ten <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants,</b> employed in the town. Thematic analysis is used to then analyse and interpret the data collected. The research explores, clarifies, and advances our understanding of how, and to what extent, the <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> support learning and inclusion. The findings from this study show that <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> support learning in education. It also illustrates that the <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> support an inclusive environment. The original contribution to our knowledge from this research is that, within the town in the North East of England, through the lens of the <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants,</b> they do support learning, development, inclusive education and social inclusion. The results, inferences and possible implications for managers, training of <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> and for future research are discussed. The findings offer support for key arguments around the quality of leadership, how <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> are deployed and the impact their training has on their role. They challenge many of the present views of <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants,</b> and the study suggests they {{have a positive impact on}} learning and inclusion.

Findings confirmed that <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> on Foundation degrees gain many personal and professional benefits from their course. These are determined by internal and external factors but include the support received during their Foundation degree course. In their workplace the <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> are given additional responsibility but often this is not acknowledged through financial recompense or enhanced status, a consequence of which is that <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> are very discouraged about the lack of recognition for their Foundation degree. This is exacerbated by the fact that whilst Foundation degrees are being promoted as having employer engagement, most head teachers lack knowledge and understanding about Foundation degrees for <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants,</b> nor do many <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> feel supported by their employer. The implication of this thesis is that whilst accepting the many benefits to the individual and their workplace, Foundation degrees are contributing towards the creation of divisions and frustration levels of <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants.</b> In this case, the impact on pupils needs to be explored.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} {{the ways in which}} <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> are deployed to support learning in secondary schools and investigates the effect of the different deployment approaches used. Much of the previous policy and research literature conceptualises the relationship between the teacher, <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant</b> and learner as tripartite and hierarchical - a three-way relationship in which the teacher has the major responsibility for promoting learning. Key debates in the literature include whether <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> make a positive contribution to learning, represent good value for money or have an impact on educational attainment. The lack of consensus provided the impetus for this case study which contributes further to the debate. In this case study, the theorisation of the <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant’s</b> role is grounded in the constructivist theories of Vygotsky and Bruner and, to a lesser extent, of Piaget. The role is also considered {{in the light of the}} theories of Bandura, Malaguzzi, Black & William and James et al. In the classroom this means that the learning is not only focused on what the <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant</b> does to support learners but also how learning is supported through the use of specific approaches. The study suggests that some models of deployment allow <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> more scope to work in particular ways which offer more opportunities for learning. Methodologically, the research takes the form of an exploratory case study. The study was completed within the defined boundaries of three schools and seven lessons. Unlike previous studies which have taken predominantly quantitative approaches and provide a focus on the measurement of learners' attainment, this case study takes a wholly qualitative approach in order to focus closely on the interaction between teachers, <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> and supported learners and how particular models of deployment support learning. The case study involved six teachers, seven <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> and fourteen learners from three state comprehensive schools, located in one local authority. Different deployment models were observed. These included the more typical model where <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> were deployed to support individuals, pairs or groups of learners within the classroom or to work in a different location with a small group of learners withdrawn from the class. Also observed was a higher level <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant</b> team <b>teaching</b> with a teacher in the classroom and a ordinary level <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant</b> deployed in managing a learning support facility and working independently from the teacher. Data were collected through a four stage approach that began with joint semi-structured interviews with pairs of <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> and teachers. Joint interviews were followed by lesson observations. Following this, teachers and <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> were interviewed separately in order to obtain their individual perceptions of the learning of supported learners in the lesson. Lastly, group interviews were conducted with supported learners to obtain their views on the support they had received. The different data sources were examined using four perspectives to identify the various ways in which <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> were being deployed and how these supported learning. The case study provided a range of qualitative data from which it was possible to explore the complexities of the relationships between teachers, <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants,</b> and learners and to identify models of <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant</b> deployment which allow them to contribute more fully to learning. The study also highlighted the importance of building professional relationships. It concluded that the lack of planning between teachers and <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants,</b> the unavailability of training for teachers on managing the work of <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> and for <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> on supporting learners, all have a negative effect on support for learning. The learners suggested that they appreciated the academic and pastoral help they were given while also being able to provide examples where learning was over-supported and, therefore, detrimental to intellectual independence. The study, therefore, has implications at different levels - for example, for policy makers and institutions who determine roles, models of deployment and the training and management of <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> when they are working both inside and outside of the classroom...|$|R

40|$|The Foundation Phase in {{education}} {{is the most important}} learning years for the learners, since what happens during these years determines later academic success. The focus {{of this study is to}} obtain Grade 1 teachers' perspectives on the need for <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> in the classroom. In South Africa, <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> are normally reserved for preschools, institutes for learners with special needs, schools that practice inclusive education and some private schools. It is therefore needed to gain information from Grade 1 teachers on how they perceive and experience the presence or absence of a <b>teaching</b> <b>assistant,</b> and what effect it has on teaching and learning in their classrooms. It is also necessary to hear the statements of <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> on how they experience this role in Grade 1 classrooms. Early Childhood Education (which includes the Foundation Phase) forms the basis of all other education; however, the South African education system is faced with numerous challenges which in various ways impede the teaching and learning of young children. These barriers include overcrowded classrooms, learner diversity and indiscipline which call for additional support in the classroom. By using a qualitative approach, this study attempts to collect and analyse the data obtained from teachers and <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants,</b> and interpret this information to gain insight into and explore various perspectives on the need for <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants</b> in a Grade 1 classroom. By making use of semi-structured interviews, data were collected from three groups of participants: teachers with <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants,</b> teachers without <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants,</b> and <b>teaching</b> <b>assistants.</b> These participants were selected from public, private and rural schools in order to allow for a broad spectrum of inputs.
