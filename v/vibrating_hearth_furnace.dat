The open hearth steelmaking had superseded Bessemer process in UK by 1900, but elsewhere in Europe, especially in Germany, the Bessemer and Thomas processes were used {{until the late}} 1960s when they were superseded by basic oxygen steelmaking. The last open <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> in the former East Germany was stopped in 1993. In the US, steel production using the Bessemer process ended in 1968 and the open <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> had stopped by 1992. In Hunedoara steel works, Romania the last 420-tonne capacity open <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> was shut down on 12 June 1999, demolished and scrapped between 2001 and 2003, but the eight smokestacks of the furnaces remained until February 2011. The last open hearth shop in China was shut down in 2001. The nation with the highest share of steel produced with open <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> (almost 50%) is Ukraine. The process is still in use in both India and Russia.|$|R

Under Mr. Ker's direction, the company continued to increase its capacity and to extend its operations. In 1910, a sixth open <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> was built, and a 14” band mill was added to the production line. In 1913, another open <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> and certain auxiliary equipment were added, which raised the annual capacity of the company to 180,000 tons of open hearth ingots.|$|R

50|$|Open <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> {{are one of}} {{a number}} of kinds of furnace where excess carbon and other {{impurities}} are burnt out of pig iron to produce steel. Since steel is difficult to manufacture due to its high melting point, normal fuels and furnaces were insufficient and the open <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> was developed to overcome this difficulty. Compared to Bessemer steel, which it displaced, its main advantages were that it did not expose the steel to excessive nitrogen (which would cause the steel to become brittle), was easier to control, and it permitted the melting and refining of large amounts of scrap iron and steel.|$|R

50|$|The AJAX process {{invented in}} 1957, and named after its originator, Albert Jackson. The process {{involved}} modifying an open <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> to use oxygen instead of air. The use of {{oxygen in the}} open hearth negated {{the need for an}} external fuel source, as with Linz-Donawitz converters.|$|R
50|$|Ultimately this {{principle}} was applied even more efficiently in regenerative heat exchangers, {{such as the}} Cowper stove (which preheat incoming blast air with waste heat from flue gas; these are used in modern blast furnaces), and in the open <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> (for making steel) by the Siemens-Martin process.|$|R
50|$|While {{arguably the}} first {{primitive}} open <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> was the Catalan forge, invented in Spain in the 8th century, it is usual to confine the term to certain 19th-century and later steelmaking processes, thus excluding bloomeries (including the Catalan forge), finery forges, and puddling furnaces from its application.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the end of}} the Second World War many {{industrial}} {{companies in}} South Yorkshire faced problems due to the decline in the need for their products. The large steel producers within the United Kingdom were nationalised in 1951 under the Labour Government, but, just two years later Steel, Peech & Tozer was de-nationalised. By the 1950s Templeborough's open <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> were in need of replacement and the United Steel Companies set about the task of updating its melting facilities. Plans, under the name “Operation SPEAR” (Steel Peech Electric Arc Reorganization), brought the most modern electric arc furnaces to the company, six of these replacing the 14 open <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces.</b> When completed Templeborough Melting Shop became the world's largest electric arc steel making plant with a capability of producing 1.8 million tons per year.|$|R

50|$|Steel {{manufacture}} in Stocksbridge {{had always}} been by melting iron and steel firstly in crucibles (from 1860), then Bessemer converters (from 1862) and Siemens Open <b>Hearth</b> <b>Furnaces</b> (from 1899 until 1968) and lastly Electric arc furnaces (from 1939 until 2005). Iron has never been produced from iron ore at Fox's, by any method.|$|R
5000|$|Steel, Peech and Tozer, {{known locally}} as [...] "Steelos" [...] {{was one of the}} largest {{manufacturers}} in the Rotherham area. In 1918 they merged with Samuel Fox and Company, based in Stocksbridge and Appleby-Frodingham Steel Company in Scunthorpe creating United Steel Companies (USC). The Templeborough steelworks was reputed to be a mile long. At its height in the mid-20th century, the company employed 10,000 people. In the 1950s as Templeborough's open <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> had become outdated USC set up “Operation SPEAR” (Steel Peech Electric Arc Reorganization), to inroduce six modern electric arc furnaces to replace the 14 open <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces.</b> This resulted in Templeborough Melting Shop becoming the largest electric arc steel making plant in the world: they were capable of producing 1.8 million tons per year. USC also employed the cybernetician Stafford Beer to run a simulation of a [...] "cybernetic factory".|$|R
50|$|Two more blast {{furnaces}} were brought into operation in 1871. Further new plant was added {{over the next}} decade, including a slab mill, a large plate mill, a billet mill and three open <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces.</b> In 1888 the company was renamed the Parkgate Iron & Steel Company Limited to reflect its increase in steelmaking.|$|R

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the fire-clay retort, higher heats could be held in the retort benches, leading to faster and more complete carbonization of the coal.

In addition, the influence of the EAFD zinc content on the exergy efficiency of both the Waelz Kiln and Rotary <b>Hearth</b> <b>Furnace</b> process was studied. The efficiencies of these high temperature metal recovery processes were also compared to the efficiency of the newly proposed In-Process Separation technology. status: publishe...|$|R
