We assume that the manufacturer will either sell the items to the <b>vendor</b> outright or offer the items to the <b>vendor</b> on a revenue sharing (consignment) basis. In the latter case, that amount of money the <b>vendor</b> pays per unit is less than if the items are purchased from the <b>vendor,</b> but the <b>vendor</b> must share some of the revenue with the manufacturer. The purpose of our analysis is to investigate under what circumstances, it would pay for the <b>vendor</b> to only purchase the items from the manufacturer, only take the items on consignment from the manufacturer, or both purchase and take consignment shipments form the manufacturer...|$|R
