30|$|The 0.8 wt% <b>Vitamin</b> <b>Bc</b> (denoted as VB, KCl solution, pH = 10.5) and {{the freshly}} as-synthesized SHNs were mixed in a {{suspension}} {{with the weight}} ratio of VB/SHNs = 1 / 2, which was stirred vigorously for 8 h. After rinsed with KCl solution (pH = 10.5) to remove the unentrapped molecules, the powders with the entrapped VB dried in vacuum. As {{a comparison of the}} test on entrapment efficiency, the experiment of bare bulk silica nanospheres (100 nm or less in diamater) entrapping VB was taken as control.|$|E
30|$|The shell wall-functionalized {{siliceous}} hollow nanospheres (SHNs) with functional molecules {{represent an}} important class of nanocarriers for a rich range of potential applications. Herein, a self-templated {{approach has been}} developed for the synthesis of in situ functionalized SHNs, in which the biocompatible long-chain polycarboxylates (i.e., polyacrylate, polyaspartate, gelatin) {{provide the framework for}} silica precursor deposition by simply controlling chain conformation with divalent metal ions (i.e., Ca 2 +, Sr 2 +), without the intervention of any external templates. Metal ions play crucial roles in the formation of organic vesicle templates by modulating the long chains of polymers and preventing them from separation by washing process. We also show that, by in situ functionalizing the shell wall of SHNs, it is capable of entrapping nearly an eightfold quantity of <b>vitamin</b> <b>Bc</b> in comparison to the bare bulk silica nanospheres. These results confirm the feasibility of guest species entrapment in the functionalized shell wall, and SHNs are effective carriers of guest (bio-)molecules potentially for a variety of biomedical applications. By rationally choosing the functional (self-templating) molecules, this concept may represent a general strategy for the production of functionalized silica hollow structures.|$|E
40|$|Background: The vitamin A {{precursor}} b-carotene (BC) promotes mammalian embryonic {{development by}} {{serving as a}} source of retinoids (vitamin A derivatives) to the developing tissues. In the Western world, increased consumption of dietary supplements, including <b>vitamin</b> A and <b>BC,</b> is common; however, the consequences of maternal high preformed vitamin A intake on embryonic uptake and metabolism of BC are poorly understood. Objective: This study investigated <b>vitamin</b> A and <b>BC</b> metabolism in developing mouse tissues after a single BC administration to pregnant wild-type (WT) mice fed purified diets with different vitamin A concentrations. Methods:WT dams fed a sufficient vitamin A (VA-S; 4. 2 mg of retinol/g of diet), high vitamin A (VA-H; 33 mg of retinol/g of diet), or excess vitamin A (VA-E; 66 mg of retinol/g of diet) diet throughout gestation were intraperitoneally injected with BC or vehicle at 13. 5 d postcoitum (dpc). At 14. 5 dpc, retinoid and BC concentrations in maternal serum and liver, placenta, and embryo were quantified by HPLC; expressions of genes controlling retinoid and BC homeostasis were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Maternal lipoprotein BC concentrations were analyzed by density gradient ultracentrifugation followed by HPLC. Results: Intact BCwas undetectable only in embryos from VA-E + BC dams. Relative to the VA-S + vehicle group, placentas from VA-S + BC dams showed 39 % downregulation of LDL-receptor–related protein 1 (Lrp 1); 35 % downregulation of VLDL receptor (Vldlr); 56 % reducedmRNA expression of b-carotene 15, 15 #-oxygenase (Bco 1); and 80 %upregulation ofb-caroten...|$|R
40|$|Background Vitamins {{involved}} in one-carbon metabolism are hypothesized to influence breast cancer (BC) risk. However, epidemiologic studies that examined associations between B <b>vitamin</b> intake and <b>BC</b> risk have provided inconsistent results. We prospectively examined, in the Italian ORDET cohort, whether B vitamin consumption {{was associated with}} risk of BC and BC subtypes. Methods After a mean follow-up of 16. 5 years, 391 BCs were diagnosed among 10, 786 cohort women. B vitamin intakes were estimated from food frequency questionnaires. Cox propor-tional hazard models adjusted for energy intake and confounders, estimated hazard ratios (HR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for BC according to intake. Results RRs were 0. 61 (95 % CI 0. 38 – 0. 97 highest vs. lowest quartile; P trend 0. 025) for thiamine; 0. 48 (95 % CI 0. 32 – 0. 71; P trend < 0. 001) for riboflavin; 0. 59 (95 % CI 0. 39 – 0. 90; P tren...|$|R
40|$|Mastitis is {{associated}} with release of free radicals, increased total oxidant capacity and decreased total antioxidants capacity in milk. Antioxidant vitamins and minerals protect the body from free radicals either by directly scavenging free radicals or by inhibiting the activity of oxidizing enzymes. The supplementation of mastitic dairy cows with antioxidant vitamins as vitamin A (VA) and β-carotene (<b>BC),</b> <b>vitamin</b> C (VC), vitamin E (VE), and antioxidant minerals as selenium (Se), Zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) {{is very important to}} help the animal recover early. The aim of this review was to discuss the oxidative stress in dairy cows’ mastitis, and the roles of VA and BC, VC, VE, Se, Zn, and Cu in mastitis of dairy cows. Before deciding to supplement dairy cow rations with the levels of vitamins and minerals, dairy farmers should have their animal feeds tested and their rations evaluated by a competent dairy cow nutritionist and a trustworthy laboratory to be sure what levels of supplementation may be warranted. While inadequate intake and absorption of certain nutrients may result in a weakened immune system and perhaps more mastitis during the lactation period, unjustified supplementation can be expensive and lead to other animal health problems...|$|R
40|$|Patients with serum antigastric parietal cell {{antibody}} (GPCA) positivity {{may have}} vitamin B 12 deficiency and some oral symptoms. This study assessed the changes of serum GPCA titer in GPCA-positive patients after effective vitamin B 12 treatment. Methods: Two hundred and ten GPCA-positive oral mucosal disease patients became oral symptom free (complete response) after 1. 0 – 67. 1  months of treatment with regular and continuous intramuscular injection of vitamin B 12 once per week. The changes of serum GPCA titers after treatment were evaluated in these 210 patients. Results: We {{found a significant}} drop of the GPCA positive rate from 100 % to 42. 9 % in our 210 complete response patients after effective vitamin B 12 treatment (p <  0. 001). When 210 patients were further divided into seven subgroups according to the low to high serum GPCA titers, we noted that the higher serum GPCA titers decreased to significantly lower levels after treatment in all seven subgroups (all p <  0. 001). However, serum GPCA titers increased to significantly higher levels in 46 GPCA-positive control patients receiving only oral administration of two <b>vitamin</b> <b>BC</b> capsules (containing 10  μg of vitamin B 12) plus deficient hematinic supplements per day after a follow-up period of 2. 7 – 27  months. A maintenance vitamin B 12 treatment once a month could retain the GPCA-negative status in 87 % of treated-to GPCA-negative patients compared with those (10 %) without further maintenance vitamin B 12 treatment. Conclusion: Regular and continuous effective vitamin B 12 treatment can reduce the relatively higher serum GPCA titers to significantly lower or undetectable levels in GPCA-positive patients...|$|E
40|$|Background/PurposeErosive oral {{lichen planus}} (EOLP) is a T-cell-mediated {{inflammatory}} disease that is refractory to treat. This study tested whether local injection of triamcinolone acetonide plus oral administration of low- or medium-dose prednisolone could hasten {{the healing of}} EOLP lesions. MethodsIn this study, 50 EOLP patients were treated with local injection of Kenacort A (40 mg triamcinolone acetonide once weekly for 3 and 2 weeks for 30 major and 20 minor EOLP patients, respectively) plus oral administration of prednisolone (25 – 30 mg and 15 – 20 mg of prednisolone once daily for 2 weeks for 30 major and 20 minor EOLP patients, respectively). The oral administration of prednisolone was tapered to 5 mg per day and stopped in 7 days. Then, the patients were treated with topical Dexaltin (0. 1 % dexamethasone, once or twice per daily) and oral administration of <b>vitamin</b> <b>Bc</b> (one capsule twice daily) thereafter. ResultsAfter 3 -week treatments, the 30 major EOLP patients showed complete response (lack of detectable erosive or ulcerative lesion with absence or regression of reticular or papular OLP) in 27 cases (90 %) and partial response (reduction of erosive or ulcerative lesion by at least 30 % in diameter with regression of reticular or papular OLP) in cases (10 %); and 20 minor EOLP patients demonstrated complete response in 18 cases (90 %) and partial response in two cases (10 %). However, all the 45 complete response major or minor EOLP patients showed recurrence of erosive or ulcerative lesion after 3 – 24 (mean 12) months of follow-up. ConclusionPrompt and complete healing of the EOLP lesions could be achieved in a relative {{short period of time}} after treatment with our protocol. Although complete response EOLP lesions recurred after a follow-up period of 3 – 24 months, patients did have an average remission period of 12 months after treatment with our protocol...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{studies of}} the {{correlation}} between breast cancer (<b>BC)</b> and <b>vitamin</b> D yielded contrasting results. Although preclinical and clinical evidence has implicated <b>vitamin</b> D in <b>BC</b> prevention and outcome, {{little is known about}} the link between vitamin D and specific BC histologically defined subtypes. In the attempt to clarify this association we correlated vitamin D levels with BC characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 220 pre- and postmenopausal women with early BC in this prospective observational trial. Data on the patients' clinical and specific BC pathological characteristics were collected and related to vitamin D levels, stratified in deficient (30 ng/mL). BC subtypes were defined according to the 14 th St Gallen Breast Cancer Conference. RESULTS: Deficient vitamin D levels were correlated with Grade 3 (P =. 015) and node-positive (P =. 043) BC, and with a higher body mass index (P =. 017). Insufficient vitamin D levels were associated with estrogen receptor expression in the primary tumor (P =. 033). Vitamin D levels were unrelated to the histological molecular subtypes of <b>BC.</b> CONCLUSION: Deficient <b>vitamin</b> D levels were correlated with more aggressive disease, namely, node-positive high grade BC, and with obesity. Should our findings be confirmed in larger prospective studies, nutritional programs designed to reduce body weight, and vitamin D supplementation might be considered a BC prevention strategy...|$|R

RRs were 0. 61 (95 % CI 0. 38 - 0. 97 highest vs. lowest quartile; P trend 0. 025) for thiamine; 0. 48 (95 % CI 0. 32 - 0. 71; P trend < 0. 001) for riboflavin; 0. 59 (95 % CI 0. 39 - 0. 90; P trend 0. 008) for vitamin B 6, and 0. 65 (95 % CI 0. 44 - 0. 95; P trend 0. 021) for folate. As regards risk of BC subtypes, high riboflavin and folate {{were significantly associated with}} lower risk of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and progesterone receptor positive (PR+) cancers, and high thiamine was associated with lower risk of ER-PR- cancers. High riboflavin was associated with lower risk of both HER 2 + and HER 2 - cancers, high folate with lower risk of HER 2 - disease, and high thiamine with HER 2 + disease. These findings support protective effects of thiamine and one-carbon metabolism vitamins (folate, riboflavin, and vitamin B 6) against BC in general; while folate may also protect against ER+PR+ and HER 2 - disease; and thiamine against ER-PR-, and HER 2 + disease...|$|R
