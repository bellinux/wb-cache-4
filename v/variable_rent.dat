40|$|In this paper, we {{formulate}} a tenant management problem for retail properties, such as shopping centers, provide an analytical framework for deriving the probability {{distribution of the}} sum of discounted future cash flows stochastically generated through tenant management, and find an optimal lease agreement structure and strategy for tenant-replacement management. More specifically, we formulate the problem of valuing the net present value of future net income from a retail property with tenant management and provide a valuation model for management decision making. The income fluctuates with market rent variations and management processes. In our framework, a property manager is required to choose an optimal mix of fixed rent and <b>variable</b> <b>rent</b> linked to tenant sales, and one of two tenant-replacement rules for return and risk enhancement. Finally, we provide an optimal strategy for this problem using Monte Carlo simulation, through which we value the real options of adopting an optimal strategy for percentage rent and tenant replacement made available by the New House Lease Law in ∗ The authors are grateful to the referees for their valuable comments.

It examines industrial warehouse rents using data for seventeen quarterly periods in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex. M/PF Research Inc. provided the data. A random effects model is used to estimate the relationship between market rents for industrial properties and various independent <b>variables.</b> <b>Rent</b> per square foot is positively related {{to the number of}} grade high doors, and the annual change in net employment. Rent per square foot is negatively effected by ceiling height, percentage of office space, building age, and the presence of a sprinkler system. The results indicate that rents are significantly impacted by physical characteristics, location, and general market conditions. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that the relationship between physical characteristics and rents is nonlinear. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays concerning the determination of wages across areas. The first essay investigates the equilibrium relationship between wages and prices across labor markets. Of central interest {{is the extent to}} which workers receive higher wages to compensate for differences in the cost of living. According to the spatial equilibrium hypothesis, the utility of homogenous workers should be equal across labor markets. This implies that controlling for amenity differences across areas, the elasticity between wages and the general price level across areas should equal one, at least under certain conditions. We test this hypothesis and find that the predicted relationship holds when housing prices are measured by rents and the general price level is instrumented to account for measurement error. When housing prices are measured by housing values, however, the wage-price elasticity is significantly less than one, even using instrumental <b>variables.</b> <b>Rents</b> reflect the price paid for housing per unit of time and are arguably the superior measure. Thus, findings in this essay provide support for the full compensation hypothesis. These findings also have important implications for researchers estimating the implicit prices of amenities or ranking the quality of life across areas. The second essay uses a national level dataset and a spatial econometric framework to examine the effects of teacher unions and other school district characteristics on teacher salaries. The results confirm that salaries for both experienced and beginning teachers are positively affected by salaries in nearby districts. Investigations of the determinants of teacher salaries that ignore this spatial relationship are likely to be misspecified. We find that union activity increases salaries for experienced teachers by as much as 16 - 21 percent but increases salaries for beginning teachers by a considerably smaller amount. This result is consistent with predictions from a median voter model...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the authors are}} {{concerned}} with the explicit introduction of endogenous spatial externalities into gravity-type allocation models. The discussion focuses on the locational choice by households, which is taken to be affected by the spatial distribution of all other actors. A stochastic linear function of utility is assumed, in which the arguments include, as endogenous <b>variables,</b> land <b>rents</b> and the level of externalities. A multinomial logit model of demand for land is defined for each zone and each population group and is imbedded in a long-run equilibrium model of the land market. The equation system which results has multiple solutions which can be found by use of a simple iterative algorithm. By means of numerical examples it is shown that positive spatial externalities result in the spatial concentration of sensitive households, whereas negative externalities lead to their dispersal to the periphery. Combined effects may result in different asymmetric local equilibria depending upon the initial solution used in the algorithm. ...|$|R

The rational approach is in many ways the easier, as there may be only one way to be right.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the paper}} we analyze a {{contractual}} relationship between two economic agents using a standard Principal-Agent approach from {{the theory of}} incentives. The Principal wants to delegate a production activity to an Agent privately informed about his marginal cost of production. This problem corresponds to a classical model of adverse selection. We first present the standard model with two types of agent and then we generalize it, assuming {{that the type of}} agent belongs to a finite set of values. We provide a full characterization of the Principal’s optimization problem and we solve it using Kuhn-Tucker techniques. Focusing on the economic interpretation of the optimal solution, we also use a change of variables. The optimization problem is next expressed in terms of the new <b>variables,</b> the informational <b>rents.</b> In {{the last part of the}} paper we derive and summarize the characteristics of the optimal contracts in the situation of asymmetric information...|$|R
40|$|Consistent {{with two}} models of {{imperfect}} {{competition in the}} labor market, the efficient bargaining model and the monopsony model, we provide two extensions of a microeconomic version of Hall's framework for estimating price-cost margins. We show that both product and labor market imperfections generate a wedge between factor elasticities in the production function and their corresponding shares in revenue that can be characterized by a "joint market imperfections parameter". Using an unbalanced panel of 10646 French firms in 38 manufacturing industries over the period 1978 - 2001, we can classify these industries into six different regimes {{depending on the type}} of competition in the product and the labor market. By far the most predominant regime is one of imperfect competition in the product market and efficient bargaining in the labor market (IC-EB), followed by a regime of imperfect competition in the product market and perfect competition or right-to-manage bargaining in the labor market (IC-PR), and by a regime of perfect competition in the product market and monopsony in the labor market (PC-MO). For each of these three predominant regimes, we assess within-regime firm differences in the estimated average price-cost mark-up and rent-sharing or labor supply elasticity parameters, following the Swamy methodology to determine the degree of true firm dispersion. As a way to assess the plausibility of our findings in the case of the dominant regime (IC-EB), we also relate our industry and firm-level estimates of price-cost mark-up and (relative) extent of rent sharing to industry characteristics and firm-specific <b>variables</b> respectively. <b>rent</b> sharing, monopsony, price-cost mark-ups, production function, panel data...|$|R

Model estimations imply that reforms may have an insignificant impact upon impact upon curtailing the rent seeking behavior among bureaucracy in a time series setting therefore this research will use two statistical econometric models to show the effect of corruption on the foreign direct inflow received in Pakistan. In order to pretest the impact of all the mentioned <b>variables</b> on <b>rent</b> seeking behavior generalized least square was used because its results were unbiased, consistent and the problem of Serial correlation was solved by using it. In order to quantify rent seeking behavior among bureaucracy different aspects of misuse of public offices appearing in form of petty and grand corruption were used using the variables informal sector, tax evasion, judicial outlay, G.

40|$|Research PaperIn marine {{resource}} management, spatial policy instruments, including Marine Protected Areas, {{are becoming}} increasingly important. The economic motivation for spatially explicit policy is that renewable resources generate, {{in addition to the}} conventionally recognized incentives to over-harvest in the face of insecure property rights, spatial externalities that distort the spatial distribution of effort away from the social optimum. Accurate predictions about responses to and the efficacy of spatial policies requires understanding spatial behavior of renewable resource users. A heterogeneous population of harvesters and the possibility that current location choices depend on past choices, i. e. state dependence, significantly confound the prediction problem.

In the absence of specific method for combining individual and structural accounts with respect to how individuals become homeless, the study created the homeless individuals' self-perceived rationales for homelessness covering ten indicators from both individual and structural accounts. The study also developed structural model overarching from adverse childhood experiences to pathways to chronic homelessness. In addition, the multilevel model was created and tested in order to test the impact of two aggregated <b>variables</b> of <b>rent</b> rate and unemployment rate in macro-level on the measurement model of rationales for homelessness in micro-level. It was hypothesized that the measurement model created the second-order latent variable of homelessness, significant associations among experiences in childhood and adulthood with pathways to become homeless, and a significant influence of macro-level factors to rationales for homelessness.; This study was a cross-sectional, quantitative survey of 3, 226 homeless individuals across the County of Los Angeles. To address the study's hypotheses, bivariate analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling with binary indicators were performed.; The measurement model fitted well to the data and configural invariance was found across gender, ethnicity, and the type of homelessness. Moreover, the structural model fitted well to the data. Gender differences were found in pathways both to become homeless, and to become chronic homeless. Adverse childhood experiences significantly explained to become homeless directly and indirectly. Additionally, the results from the multilevel model showed that the rate of rent was found to be significant and explained the majority of variances in the between-level model. The findings from three model tests clearly presented that the combination of individual and structural accounts explained both rationales for homelessness and pathways to homelessness...|$|R

Especificamente, avalia-se a sensibilidade do uso dos insumos a alterações nos preços, assim como a interdependência no mercado dos fatores produtivos. Para tanto, utilizou-se a elasticidade de substituição de Allen. As despesas com insumos e mão-de-obra apresentaram as maiores parcelas dos custos operacionais unitários de produção em Minas Gerais e São Paulo. Em relação à substitutibilidade/complementaridade entre os fatores em Minas Gerais, nota-se que havia relação de complementaridade entre aluguel da terra e operações com máquinas, terra e mão-de-obra, e entre máquinas e insumos, e relação de substitutibilidade entre os demais fatores. Já no Estado de São Paulo, observa-se que os fatores aluguel da terra e mão-de-obra foram complementares e os demais substitutos entre si.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{discover}} whether there was a relationship between economic development and higher education in Iran from 1953 to 1979. Seven variables were used to define economic development. These variables were factor analyzed and the outcome was three new empirically satisfying <b>variables</b> labeled <b>Rent</b> (R), Finance (F), and Technology (T) which were used as dependent and independent variables in subsequent analyses. In order to define higher education, just one variable, constant dollar expenditures on higher education, was used. Several changes occurred in Iran during 1953 to 1979. Therefore, two intervention variables (for the periods of 1962 and 1973) were used to present these changes. Three models were used in order to examine the relationship between economic development and higher education. Using 2 stage least square in model one tested the hypothesis that the educational variable and development variable (T) were mutually causal. In this model two identification variables (energy consumption and the number of students in higher education) were used in order to identify the effect of the technological growth and expenditures on higher education. This model had two regression equations. In the first equation the dependent variable was the technological dimension of economic growth (T). The only significant effect was the concomitant incremental relationship between energy consumption and technological growth. In the second equation the dependent variable was the expenditures on higher education, and the only significant effect was the second lagged relationship between technological growth and the education. Using 2 stage least square tested the hypothesis that educational expenditures depended upon the import-export ration (R). There was no significant effect in this model. Also using ordinary stage least square tested the hypothesis that educational expenditures depended upon increases in the money stock (F). This model was highly significant. Based on the major findings of this study, the increase of the expenditures on higher education depended upon the increase of the economic growth factors.

40|$|The {{existing}} literature identifies natural resource wealth {{as a major}} determinant of civil war. The dominant causal link is that resources provide finance and motive (the “looting rebels ” model). Others see natural resources as causing “political Dutch disease, ” which in turn weakens state capacity (the “state capacity ” model). In the looting rebels model, resource wealth first increases, but then decreases the risk for civil war as very large wealth enables governments to constrain rebels, whereas in the state capacity model, large resource wealth is unambiguously related to higher risk of war. This research note uses a new dataset on natural resource rents that are disaggregated as mineral and energy rents for addressing the resources-conflict relationship. We find that neither a dummy variable for major oil exporters nor our resource <b>rents</b> <b>variables</b> predict civil war onset with a 1000 -battle-death threshold coded by Fearon and Laitin (2003) in the period after 1970 for which rents data are available. However, using a lower threshold of 25 battle deaths, we find that energy wealth, but not mineral wealth, increases the risk for civil war onset. We find no evidence for a nonlinear relationship between either type of resources and civil war onset.

Nevertheless, one of the most important criticisms to Spanish studies is related to the variable selected to proxy household's income. Until 2007 the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) did not include an estimation of the value of house's ownership. The lack of that estimation could provoke biased results at least by two ways: it underestimates some incomes and, at the same time, it affects families' distribution around the poverty line. In 2007 this <b>variable,</b> called Imputed <b>Rent</b> (IMRENT), was calculated for the first time in Spain. Therefore, it was possible to use it and compare the results obtained following the traditional methodology or introducing a new calculation of Income per Unit of Equivalent Consumption in Spanish households taking into account IMRENT. We present a descriptive analysis and a probit estimation to calculate the probability of leaving poverty when the variable is considered. The results show the relevance of this proxy to households' wealth since its incorporation change the profile of Spanish poor: if we do not consider it most people older than 65 years are under poverty line, especially women. But if we include it a big share of widows and retired people cross the border and leave poverty. There is a clear economic policy implication: in the actual situation, with problems to finance Public Pensions' System, it should be necessary to take into account not only current income but wealth to calculate Spanish widow's and retirement pensions.

40|$|The {{informal}} sector {{has been recognized}} for its role in contributing towards national output and employment. In particular, the information and communication technology (lCT) sector has become a vital part in its contribution to the economy. In Kenya, especially the urban centers, the ICT sector has been recording a significant change facilitated by the Internet. This has been possible due to the proliferation of Internet cyber cafes that provide access to the Internet at a minimum cost. This research paper analyzed {{the performance of the}} Internet cyber cafes in Nairobi province. A total of 70 cyber cafes from Nairobi were selected using the two-stage cluster sampling technique out of which four (4) cyber cafes were identified as outliers and hence the sample population was reduced to 66 cases. The data was analyzed using both descriptive statistics and the use of an econometric model. Performance of the cyber cafes was measured by output per month in terms of total hours used on the Internet by the customers and was regressed against explanatory variables. These explanatory <b>variables</b> included; monthly <b>rent,</b> cost of maintenance of computers per month, distance between the cyber cafes, age of the cyber cafe, total wages paid to the employees per month and the total hours of operation per month. The regression results revealed that rent (bigger space) was the most statistically significant variable in determining the performance of the cyber cafes. Other factors that significantly affect output are the age of the cyber cafe and total hours of operation per month. Based on the findings of the study, it is recommended that the cyber cafes should be encouraged to expand their services which in turn would result in increased employment opportunities. This could be achieved by expanding business space in the province that will enable the cafes to acquire more equipment and thus hire more labour and as a result increase their respective output. The government should also ensure that high security measures are attained and maintained to encourage the cyber cafes to operate for longer hours which in turn will generate higher output levels.

40|$|This {{research}} originates {{from the}} lack of knowledge within the scientific literature on the conditions under which tenants and landlords of Dutch retail property actually opt for turnover rent. Where scientific and news sources were more focused on the reasons why turnover rent is not used in the Netherlands more often, this study attempted to address the subject from the other side. In that way, balanced knowledge arises and parties are informed about the contract choices. Therefore the aim was to provide insight into the conditions that gave parties enough reasons to choose for a turnover rent contract. The following question formed the basis for this study: Why do tenants and landlords use turnover rent contracts at Dutch retail property, what obstacles do they face and how do they to deal with it? To answer the research question, literature research has been done, thirteen semi-structured interviews with market participants are conducted and desk research has been done. First as a reference, three interviews were held with one investor who operates in three European countries. In addition, three contracts from these countries were analysed together with the rental income which partially resulted from turnover rent. During the interviews with parties with real estate in the Netherlands, five different types of landlords with shopping malls, two landlords with retail in shopping streets and three retailers were questioned. For the Netherlands, a standard agreement with a fixed rent was analysed. From the interviews and data analysis on European retail property, it appears that the base rent with turnover rent component, is the standard form of contract. The rental income differs based on the different branches of stores. Shoe stores pay, on average, the most rent in proportion to their turnover (9. 8 %) and in most countries, telecommunications and electronics stores pay the lowest rent in proportion to their turnover (2. 8 %). Of the total rental income, only a small fraction (1. 5 %) came from turnover rent income. The study shows that the parties with a standard ROZ contract agree on a revalued indexed rent. In this study, this form is described as the traditional fixed rent. Landlords of shopping centres in the Netherlands that use turnover rent, generally apply contracts with a base rent with a turnover rent component company-wide. In addition they also use a traditional fixed rent, a full fixed rent / total turnover <b>rent,</b> a <b>variable</b> turnover <b>rent</b> or a total turnover rent. Landlords with retail objects in shopping streets generally use a standard fixed rent agreement and, in exceptional situations, a base rent with turnover rent component. For owners of shopping centres, or retail locations where influence on the turnover of retailers is possible, it is advised to use turnover rent contracts with the highest possible base rent for all retail units. Exceptions are made for anchor tenants and tenants that have a showrooming store. It is advised to still make arrangements for providing the turnovers for proactive management. For landlords with shops in shopping streets, or locations where the owner has no influence on the conversion of the retailer, it’s advised to use a fixed traditional rent contracts. Exceptions are made in situations where there are no other possibilities and vacancy will arise. For retailers, it is wise to financially calculate the ideal form of contract, based on the projected sales compared to desired rent from the landlord. If the retailer projects more turnover than the landlord, it’s wise to agree on a fixed rent contract. If the landlord projects a higher sales potential than the retailer, it’s wise to negotiate a turnover rent contract based on the projections from the landlord. If a fixed rent contract is agreed and the landlord has influence on the turnover of the retailer, in for instance a shopping centre, it’s smart to still give insight in the sales as an information tool for proactive asset management.

These can {{be based on}} independent drivers of core property and economic activities. Accurate predictions can only be conducted when ample quantitative data are available with fewer uncertainties. However, a broad-fronted social, technical and ecological evolution can throw up sudden, unexpected shocks that result in the econometric outputs sceptical to unknown risk factors. Therefore, this paper aims at evaluating Australian office market forecast accuracy and {{to determine whether the}} forecasts capture extreme downside risk events. Design/methodology/approach: This study follows a quantitative research approach, using secondary data analysis to test the accuracy of economists’ forecasts. The forecast accuracy evaluation encompasses the measurement of economic and property forecasts under the following phases: (i) testing for the forecast accuracy, (ii) analysing outliers of forecast errors and (iii) testing of causal relationships. Forecast accuracy measurement incorporates scale independent metrics that include Theil’s U values (U 1 and U 2) and mean absolute scaled error (MASE). Inter Quartile Range (IQR) rule is used for the outlier analysis. To find the causal relationships among variables, the time series regression methodology is utilised, including multiple regression analysis and Granger causality developed under the vector auto regression (VAR). Findings: The credibility of economic and property forecasts was questionable around the period of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC); a significant man-made Black Swan event. The forecast accuracy measurement highlighted rental movement and net absorption forecast errors as the critical inaccurate predictions. These key property variables are explained by historic information and independent economic variables. However, these do not explain the changes when error time series of the variables were concerned. According to VAR estimates, all property variables have a significant causality derived from the lagged values of Australian S&P/ASX 200 (ASX) forecast errors. Therefore, lagged ASX forecast errors {{could be used as a}} warning signal to adjust property forecasts. Research Limitations: Secondary data were obtained from the premier Australian property markets: Canberra, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne and Perth. A limited 10 -year timeframe (2001 – 2011) was used in the ex-post analysis for the comparison of economic and property variables. Forecasts ceased from 2011, due to the discontinuity of the Australian Financial Review (AFR) quarterly survey of economists; the main source of economic forecast data. Practical implications: The research strongly recommended naïve forecasts for the property variables, as an input determinant in each office market forecast equation. Further, lagged forecast errors in the ASX could be used as a warning signal for the successive property forecast errors. Hence, data adjustments can be made to ensure the accuracy of the Australian office market forecasts. Originality/value: The paper highlights the critical inaccuracy of the Australian office market forecasts around the GFC. In an environment of increasing incidence of unknown events, these types of risk events should not be dismissed as statistical outliers in real estate modelling. As a proactive strategy to improve office market forecasts, lagged ASX forecast errors could be used as a warning signal. This causality was mirrored in rental movements and total vacancy forecast errors. The close interdependency between rents and vacancy rates in the forecasting process and the volatility in rental cash flows reflects on direct property investment and subsequently on the ASX, is therefore justified...|$|R
40|$|The real {{euro area}} house price has {{increased}} steadily since 1997 reaching more than 6. 5 % in 2004 and 2005. The rise {{on its own}} is not as striking as the long lasting effect of the phenomenon. Indeed, it is the longest lasting house price increase ever experience in the euro area since data are available. Due {{to a lack of}} data, I use panel econometrics. The estimated coefficients are then used to generate euro area fitted values in all three papers. In my first paper, I investigate the question whether we can explain past house price movements by the arbitrage theory. Since arbitrage is a static phenomenon, I use within FE and RE estimators. The pattern of the residuals proves that arbitrage is not the core mechanism in house price determination. This may be due to large transaction costs, but also housing is un-tradable by nature, and finally government regulations. Alternative explanations are, friendly tax schemes to promote home ownership against alternative assets, government regulations like tenants rights, and finally massive public investment to build social houses for small income households. Instead, in my second paper, I suggest to analyze directly the interaction of supply and demand together with the mortgage market. Due to endogeneity, Anderson & Hsiao (1981) and the GMM Arellano-Bond (1991) dynamic panel estimator (AB) are used. However, in macro-panel data, the time dimension is much larger than the cross-sectional dimension. A trade-off arises between efficiency and consistency. Thus, the results are checked by means of LSDV (Least Square Dummy Variables) estimates, which are indeed close to the AB estimates. In the third paper, a general equilibrium model underpins the choice of macro-variables. To disentangle long-term from short-term dynamics, the PMG (Pooled Mean Group) estimator developed by Pesaran, Shin & Smith (1997) is used. The PMG assumes homogeneity of long-run coefficients (or a sub-set) but without making implausible assumption of common short-term coefficients. In the short-term coefficients are allowed to vary across countries. Indeed, mortgage and house market in the euro area are characterized to be strongly heterogeneous. The conclusions on the short-term dynamics of the house prices are alike between the second and the third paper. As regards the factors: disposable income per capita and the autoregressive term mostly drive the house price dynamics. Moreover, the demographic <b>variables</b> and <b>rents</b> do not account in the short term house price dynamics. The conclusion on the long-term house price are mainly explained in the third paper. The empirical results of the Panel ECM suggest a strong long-term empirical relationship between house price and disposable income, interest rate, stock of dwelling, population, but also mortgage loan. However, long-term house price equilibrium is mainly driven by disposable incomes and interest rates. How can we explain the long lasting house price increase in the euro area? First, {{in the wake of the}} monetary union process, household’s in the euro area experienced a positive shift in their borrowing capacity which had a positive impact on house price dynamics. Second, the euro area business cycle since 1999 has been stabilized by means of an optimal leaning against the wind policy which has no pedigree in the euro area. The slowdown of the economy since 2001 has been offset by an accommodative policy. Monetary policy stance indicators like interest rate and mortgage loan development prove a leaning against the wind policy which sustained strong housing demand. Excess demand factor indicates that sticky supply did not react quickly enough, the overshooting of demand kept soaring house prices. Current house price cycle is above 2 % since 1998, i. e. already 8 years (10 years with our adjustment process), the longest lasting cycle ever experienced. Thus, two effects explain this fact. The low interest rate in level due to the gained credibility and variation in interest rate (opticmal monetary policy). In contrast, the previous cycle duration was much shorter, i. e. from the mid- 80 s to the mid- 90 s. As inflation was already rising in the end of the 80 s, the Bundesbank raised its discount rate in 1988, and kept tightening it until 1992 due to the German monetary reunification. The one to one exchange with the East-mark obliged the Bundesbank to lead an even harsher policy. The other member countries of the ERM (European Ex-change Rate Mechanism) had to follow at odds with an optimal monetary policy. Consequently, the “euro area” interest rates increased dramatically. Beyond the cyclical component, the overall interest rate level was excessively high. The financial liberalization in the mid- 80 s caused sharp real estate increases. Thereafter, high interest rates coupled with a weak business cycle dampened relatively quickly soaring house prices. Currently, the ECB reputation allowed a structural real and nominal real interest rate fall, as well as an optimal monetary policy in view of the business cycle fluctuations. This explains why current house price cycle already lasts twice as long as the previous one. As regards the mortgage market (second paper), collateral (house price) is the only core factor. Consequently, house market and mortgage market strongly interact via the collateral. Banks relax their lending standards by favourable house price prospects due to asymmetric information. Households can capture more mortgage loans which fuels demand. Higher house price impinges positively on household’s wealth. This self-perpetuating process is then reversed by a trigger event like monetary policy tightening. An interest rate increase of 1 % causes a 1 % house price inflation drop and a 0. 4 % decline in mortgage loan growth rate in the long term, according to the estimates. The interest rate shock has only a temporary effect on the mortgage market on its own but the collateral (house price) drop leads to a long lasting fall in mortgage loan volume. To conclude, interest rate increase impinges negatively on real house price growth, proving that demand outweighs supply. As a result, monetary can influence house price growth. The estimates of the euro area house price equilibrium (third paper) prove three positive misalignments with respect to actual house prices. The first started during the second oil price shock until the mid 80 ’s. The second began in the late 80 ’s and ended in the mid 90 ’s. Finally, current house prices has overshot equilibrium price since 2001 and has not shown mean reversion yet. This history is in line with the literature on housing. However, the gap between house price equilibrium and current price cannot be assimilated to a bubble as defined by Stiglitz (1990). The misalignment of current prices to long-term equilibrium price characterizes a natural feature of the functioning of the house market. Supposing the tide starts to turn in 2006, current house prices would smoothly catch up equilibrium price in 5 to 6 years according to the Panel ECM. In the simulation of current house prices adjustment to equilibrium level, I suppose that all explanatory variables equal simultaneously their steady value in 2006 and onwards. The adjustment depicts a 4 % growth rate in 2006 and thereafter 2 % and then a tiny negative rate of approximately 2 years until 0 % (in real terms). This is a smooth and soft landing in opposite to the “biggest bubble in history” documented by the Economist for instance. This empirical study might prove that no recession will occur and even less a deflation. First, most of the huge house price increase in the euro area is explained by the fundamentals and second, the bank risk exposure is relatively moderate, they have mostly already implemented Basel II, which will be officially implemented in 2008.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} fact that stand {{structure}} is significantly disturbed and from the assumption that all stands of pedunculate oak at forest level older than 100 years are potentially considered for stand regeneration, it is obvious that forest planning and management have to define their priorities on the basis of which individual, potentially mature and mature stands, will be regenerated. The general objective {{of this paper is to}} research the structure and mutual impacts of stand, site and economic factors on the elements of stand structure in a greater area of pedunculate oak forests consisting of old or potentially mature pedunculate oak stands with a disturbed structure. Based on obtained structural relations, the goal was to determine by modeling the easily obtainable elements of the variable (model), which will represent the objective criterion for stand ranking according to the regeneration priority and structural and economic requirements. The subject of the research are pedunculate oak forests in the Central Posavina region, where 37 stands, with stocking of less than 0. 8, were randomly selected and divided into 3 age groups (101 – 120 years, 121 – 135 years, > 135 years) in 16 management units. On a total of 146 established plots of 25 m radius, estimates and measurements were carried out of variables at the level of individual model trees (6 trees of the main species – upper storey layer – nearest to the plot centre) and of stand and site variables (2 breast-height diameters, crown diameter, tree height, base height of the crown and height of the widest part of the crown, varietal trunk structure, crown defoliation, increment core, breast-height diameter of all trees higher than 1. 3 m, seedlings, potential intermediate cutting, died trees, diameters of stump of cut trees, shrub layer, microrelief, canopy, health status, litter, understorey vegetation). The estimated and measured data were processed and appropriate variables for data analysis derived. The complex potential revenue (rent) difference was defined for stand regeneration (Equation 3) as a dependent variable and objective criterion for stand ranking according to regeneration priority. By means of partial linear analyses, multivariate analysis and modeling (generalized linear modeling), mutual and complex impacts of stand, site and economic factors on elements of stand structure and potential revenue (rent) difference were investigated. Statistical analyses were performed by application of the SAS software package, whereas descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, integration of functions and development of graphical presentations were carried out by means of the STATISTICA 8. 2 software package. The research included different management, stand and structural characteristics (Table 1) and determined a statistically significant mutual impact of individual variables of stand, site and economic factors on certain elements of stand structure and potential revenue (rent) difference (Table 2). Multivariate analysis revealed models of complex impacts of stand, site and economic factors on standing volume of pedunculate oak and revenue (rent) difference (Table 3). According to the obtained data, all three models are statistically significant for the estimated standing volume of pedunculate oak and also for the estimated revenue (rent) difference. The stand factors in total account for 35 % variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 22 % variability of revenue (rent) difference. The site factors account for 39 % variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 34 % variability of revenue (rent) difference, whereas economic factors account for even 45 % variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 43 % variability of revenue (rent) difference. The results of the Tukey post hoc (HSD) test for statistically significant variables of multivariate analysis of the revenue (rent) difference and the standing volume of pedunculate oak (Table 4) indicate that there exists a relation between the standing volume of pedunculate oak as a complex structure element and the potential revenue (rent) difference. The results proved the existence of a direct impact of individual elements of main tree species as well as a complex impact of structure elements on the variable of potential revenue (rent) difference (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). The standing volume of pedunculate oak as a complex structure element is a suitable dependent variable, along with the revenue (rent) difference, for comparative analysis of impacts of statistically significant stand, site and economic factors on stand regeneration priority. Due to a significantly smaller standing volume of pedunculate oak as a consequence of its disturbed structure, there is a higher regeneration priority for the youngest stand group (100 to 119 years) in comparison with the older stands. Accordingly, in forests with disturbed structure age cannot be an objective criterion for planning stand regeneration. Stands with disturbed canopy of understorey layer with the smallest and lowest value of standing volume expectedly have the highest regeneration priority, i. e. their maintenance would lead to both economic losses and disturbed site conditions. In view of site preservation, the problem is particularly marked in case of pure stands, where pedunculate oak trees do not cover the soil in a sufficient measure, and have a worsening tendency due to weakening and dying of trees. According to the obtained results, which indicate that there is a relation between site and standing volume of pedunculate oak and revenue (rent) difference, stands with better site have lower regeneration priority. This is related to the fact that stand structure on a higher quality site is characterized by a lower number of pedunculate oak trees of larger dimensions and potentially large value increase, which is also characteristic of forest communities of pedunculate oak and common hornbeam. On average, a smaller standing volume of pedunculate oak in a floodplain pedunculate oak forest and a higher regeneration priority indicate disturbed structure conditions. Due to hydro-ameliorative works, this community has suffered even greater site changes and is more in danger of dieback, so regeneration will be more difficult and expectably less successful in case of stands with disturbed site and structure conditions, both at early and delayed regeneration. Regarding the proportional relation between the quantity of prescribed cut and the standing volume of pedunculate oak, stands with better structure and higher prescribed intermediate cut are expected to have a lower regeneration priority. A prescribed cut below 15 m 3 /ha (50 % sampled plots) indicates a significant share of preserved stands left to natural development, with necessary felling of only weak and dying trees by the beginning of regeneration or recovery. The stand structure characteristics according to their belonging to individual management units are more a consequence of spatial differences in site and structure conditions than a management characteristic. Thus we can separate 3 management units in the centre of the Lonjsko polje floodplain (Žutica, Kutina floodplain forests and Brezovica), where dieback of pedunculate oak was the highest and which have a more marked stand regeneration priority in comparison to the management units with a more preserved structure of old stands (Trstika, Josip Kozarac). The impact of individual structure elements of pedunculate oak, unlike the rent, has a high correlation, with the exception of numbers of pedunculate oak trees. This can be explained by the fact that the same number of pedunculate oak trees can represent very different structural relations in terms of average dimensions of pedunculate oak trees, basal area and standing volume of pedunculate oak as well as different rate of other tree species in the structure. A particular significance with regards to the application of the results can be seen in the fact that easily obtainable structural elements, such as pedunculate oak basal area, number of pedunculate oak trees and diameter increment of pedunculate oak, proved to be very good indicators, which can explain nearly 70 % variability of the complex impact on the revenue (rent) difference. The obtained research results prove the existence of a direct relation between stand structure and regeneration priority. There is, therefore, a practical possibility to apply the established complex <b>variable</b> of revenue (<b>rent)</b> difference for ranking of stands or stand parts (stand dividing) according to regeneration priority, which can be determined by means of easily obtainable elements of structure (tree numbers, basal area and diameter increment of pedunculate oak). An extension of the research into site-structure relations to include a greater, or even the entire area of pedunculate oak forests in Croatia as well as spatial and multiobjective forest management criteria (spatial distribution and area of stands for regeneration, habitat requirements) for stand regeneration planning would be a welcome continuation of this work...|$|R

Svrha je rada odgovoriti na to pitanje odabirom objektivnoga kriterija za rangiranje sastojina prema prioritetu za obnovu, koji se zasniva na lako pridobivim elementima strukture sastojina. Predmet su istraživanja šume hrasta lužnjaka u srednjoj Posavini, gdje je u 16 gospodarskih jedinica po načelu slučajnosti odabrano 37 starijih i starih sastojina narušena obrasta. Na 146 ploha polumjera 25 m provedena je procjena i izmjera varijabli na razini pojedinačnih modelnih stabala, varijabli sastojine, te stanišnih i gospodarskih varijabli. Obradom podataka, parcijalnim linearnim i multivarijatnim analizama te modeliranjem istraživan je utjecaj strukturnih značajki na prioritet obnove. Rezultati su istraživanja potvrdili statistički značajnu ovisnost između sastojinskih, stanišnih i gospodarskih čimbenika, strukture sastojina i razlike budućih potencijalnih prihoda. Oni pokazuju postojanje neposredne veze između strukture sastojine i prioriteta obnove. Starije su sastojine hrasta lužnjaka (100 – 120 godina) narušenije strukture i imaju veći prioritet obnove. Ustanovljena složena varijabla razlike u renti odrediva je lako pridobivim elementima strukture (broj stabala, temeljnica i debljinski prirast hrasta lužnjaka), te postoji mogućnost njezine praktične primjene pri rangiranju sastojina ili dijelova sastojina (izlučivanje) prema prioritetu obnove. Proširenje istraživanja stanišno-strukturnih odnosa na šire ili cijelo područje lužnjakovih šuma, te uključivanje prostornih kriterija i kriterija višenamjenskoga gospodarenja šumama može biti očekivan nastavak ovoga istraživanja.
