40|$|We used an identities {{approach}} to examine <b>voting</b> <b>intentions</b> in the June 2016 UK referendum on {{membership of the}} European Union (EU). In April 2016, 303 British adults (58. 7 % women, age M = 34. 73) indicated their <b>voting</b> <b>intentions</b> for the referendum and completed measures of identification with the national in-group, perceived threat from Muslim immigrants, belief in Islamophobic conspiracy narratives, Islamophobia, general conspiracist beliefs, ambiguity tolerance, and belief in a clash of civilizations. Path and mediation analyses indicated that greater belief in Islamophobic conspiracy theories mediated the link between Islamophobia and <b>intention</b> to <b>vote</b> to leave. Islamophobia and Islamophobic conspiracist beliefs also mediated the effects of perceived threat from Muslims on <b>voting</b> <b>intentions.</b> Other variables acted as antecedents of perceived threat or Islamophobic conspiracy narratives. These findings highlight the role that identity-based cognitions may have played in shaping <b>voting</b> <b>intentions</b> for the UK EU referendum...|$|R

Support was highest among those aged between 25 and 34, where 78% agreed and 19% disagreed. It was lowest amongst those over 65 where 37% agreed and 52% disagreed. A majority of both men and women agreed, but support was higher among women (67%) than men (55%). In terms of <b>voting</b> <b>intention,</b> 73% of Liberal Democrats, 64% of Labour voters and 53% of Conservatives agreed that same-sex couples {{should have the right to}} marry.|$|E

In the Oldham East and Saddleworth by-election, 2011 held on 13 January 2011, the Liberal Democrats gained 31.9% of the vote, a 0.3% increase despite losing to Labour. In a by-election in the South Yorkshire constituency of Barnsley in March 2011, the Liberal Democrats fell from second place at the general election to sixth.|$|E

2500|$|Due {{in part to}} {{the high}} profile of the constituency's then-MP Nick Clegg, who served as Deputy Prime Minister during the 2010–15 Parliament, Sheffield Hallam is unusual in having had seven constituency-specific opinion polls {{conducted}} between 2010 and 2015. Each of these polls suggested significant changes in the vote share compared to 2010 general election. The first poll, in October 2010, suggested a drop in the Lib Dem lead in the seat to just 2%, from nearly 30% at the general election five months earlier. Five of the six remaining polls, which appeared between May 2014 and May 2015, suggested that Labour was in the lead in the seat by this time, with the Labour lead fluctuating to between 1% and 10%, and one put the Lib Dems in the lead. On average across all seven opinion polls, Labour had a lead over the Lib Dems of 2.5%. The Conservatives came second in one poll, and third in the other six polls. [...] It {{should be noted that the}} May 2015 ICM poll scores displayed are those of the constituency <b>voting</b> <b>intention</b> question. The same poll also carried the standard <b>voting</b> <b>intention</b> question, which showed a Labour lead.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} effects of {{political}} discussions with parents, political discussions with peers and exposure to political news during an election campaign on the <b>voting</b> <b>intentions</b> and behaviour of first-time voters. Longitudinal data collected in the Czech Republic are employed in the main analysis (N= 223). Results show that young people who frequently discuss politics with their peers are characterized by higher <b>voting</b> <b>intentions</b> and subsequent electoral participation. On the other hand, political discussions with parents and exposure to political news have no such effects. Furthermore, although {{it does not have}} an impact on <b>voting</b> <b>intentions,</b> more frequent political discussions with parents predict increased frequency of political discussions with peers. Overall, our results underscore the importance of peers in late adolescents' political socialization...|$|R
40|$|Exploring the {{question}} of community engagement and political participation by younger Australians, this project analyses fifteen years of Newspoll surveys. Youth <b>voting</b> <b>intentions</b> over the most recent 15 years of Newspoll quarterly data were investigated using both statistical and graphical means. An initial approach (after Watson, 2008) separated the various age groups, 18 ‐ 24 s, 25 ‐ 34 s, and all others (35 +), on their <b>voting</b> <b>intentions</b> for Labor, the Coalition and the Greens in calendar years leading to a Federal Election in order to compute confidence intervals and t‐tests on any age group differences. Graphs of the youth <b>voting</b> <b>intentions</b> for the parties were contrasted {{with those of the}} others and consistent statistically significant differences were found for the vote for the Coalition and the Greens between these groups. While Labor was distinguished on the <b>voting</b> <b>intentions</b> support of the 18 ‐ 24 s from the others in 2010, 2007, and 2004, it was the 25 ‐ 34 s who had the greater <b>voting</b> <b>intentions</b> percentages in 1998 and 1996. A second approach aggregated the age groups, 18 ‐ 24, 25 ‐ 34, 35 ‐ 49, and 50 +, and constructed line graphs for <b>voting</b> <b>intentions</b> in the electoral cycles up to 2010. Major parties trendline graphs were supplemented by specific graphs for Labor, the Coalition and the Greens which were further analysed by correlational analyses to establish the youth groups’ commonality with the other groups. Youth <b>voting</b> <b>intentions</b> were here confirmed from those of other age groups. Although the 25 ‐ 34 s have appeared to take the lead on separate occasions, it was the 18 ‐ 24 s who were consistently at the extremes in their <b>voting</b> <b>intentions</b> for all parties. The latter’s support though was seen to be extremely volatile but generally {{in the direction of the}} progressive left‐oriented parties. A final section used both graphs and a correlational analysis to identify gender differences amongst the youth groups and the others. All age/gender groups were distinguished from the others to a greater or lesser degree, but the 18 ‐ 24 females were seen to be the most unique. Their consistent variation from the <b>voting</b> <b>intentions</b> of the other age/groups highlights how they must have different priorities in the values they hold concerning their voting preference. Overall this study has confirmed the youth groups, especially the neophyte electors (18 ‐ 24 s), have supported the progressive small “l” parties over the conservative ones. They have been the most volatile of the groups but nonetheless the most consistently anti‐conservative. A gender effect has been apparent amongst the 18 ‐ 24 s in which the females’ support of parties with “green” or socially supportive policies has outstripped all others.
