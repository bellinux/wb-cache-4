Subsidized by the government, the studio was able to produce about six feature films each year.|$|E
5000|$|The Allied Filmmakers cut is {{drastically}} {{different from}} Williams's workprint. Four musical {{numbers have been}} added; the film originally had none. Many scenes have been cut: These primarily consist of scenes involving the thief, most notably his attempted theft of an emerald and his subsequent evasion of capital punishment for it, and the subplot wherein Zigzag tries to feed Tack to Phido. Also removed are any references to the maiden from Mombassa, whom Zigzag gives to King Nod as a [...] "plaything" [...] in the workprint. Tack, almost mute in the workprint, speaks several times and narrates most scenes in past tense; the workprint had narration only in the beginning by a <b>voice-over.</b> <b>Some</b> subplots have been added; in one, Yum-Yum is tired of living a life of [...] "regal splendor", and wishes to prove her worth to her father. Another subplot sees the nurse initially disliking Tack, and scolding Yum-Yum for harboring romantic feelings for him, but warming to him later on. There are also several lines of alternate or removed dialogue.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to its {{full-scale}} broadcasts, KLRT {{provided some}} brief news updates {{and public affairs}} programming during its earliest years on the air. Early weather segments were once presented by former KKYK-FM and KURB morning disc jockey and current KTHV news anchor Craig O'Neill. O'Neill included a vocal rendition of his radio character [...] "Sherman Bonner, the World's Only Human Thermometer" [...] to <b>voice-over</b> <b>some</b> of the weather introductions. Newsbriefs were presented by Bill Powell (formerly of KTHV) and Linda Gilliam {{on an individual basis}} in the early years. Ron Breeding, who then primarily worked with radio station KARN-FM (now working with the University of Arkansas at Little Rock via NPR member station KUAR) provided news and later weather updates for the station in the late-1980s. On September 4, 2000, the station began airing [...] "Fox First Weather", a five-minute late evening weather forecast segment that ran until shortly before KLRT's newscasts debuted (the program was similar to a locally produced weather insert that aired on former sister station KOKI-TV in Tulsa from 1997 to 2002).|$|E

50|$|Mirror {{depicts the}} thoughts, {{emotions}} and memories of Alexei, or Alyosha (Ignat Daniltsev), {{and the world}} around him as a child, adolescent, and forty-year-old. The adult Alexei is only briefly glimpsed, but is present as a <b>voice-over</b> in <b>some</b> scenes including substantial dialogue. The structure of the film is discontinuous and nonchronological, without a conventional plot, and combines incidents, dreams and memories along with some news-reel footage. The film switches among three different time-frames: prewar (1935), war-time (1940s), and postwar (1960s or '70s).|$|R

5000|$|Thus, {{elements}} of a film can be [...] "diegetic" [...] or [...] "non-diegetic". These terms are most commonly used in reference to sound in a film, but can apply to other elements. For example, an insert shot that depicts something that is neither {{taking place in the}} world of the film, nor is seen, imagined, or thought by a character, is a non-diegetic insert. Titles, subtitles, and <b>voice-over</b> narration (with <b>some</b> exceptions) are also non-diegetic.|$|R
500|$|Following this success, Kneale gave up {{acting to}} write full-time.

Kneale's publisher was keen for him to write a novel, but Kneale himself was more interested in writing for television.

2500|$|Grampa's {{voice is}} {{performed}} by Dan Castellaneta, who also voices numerous other characters, including Homer Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Barney Gumble, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby and Hans Moleman. Castellaneta {{was part of}} the regular cast of The Tracey Ullman Show and had previously done <b>some</b> <b>voice-over</b> work in Chicago alongside his wife Deb Lacusta. Castellaneta likes to stay in character during recording sessions, and tries to visualize a scene in his mind so that he can give the proper voice to it. The episode [...] "Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy" [...] (season six, 1994) featured many interactions between Grampa and Homer, so Castellaneta therefore had to talk to himself when he recorded the voices for that episode. Castellaneta said it is hard for him to do Grampa's voice because it is [...] "wheezy and airy".|$|R

50|$|In Bulgaria, multi {{voice-over}} is also common, {{but each}} film (or episode) is normally voiced by three-six actors. The voice artists try {{to match the}} original voice and preserve the intonation. The main reason {{for the use of}} this type of translation is that unlike synchronized voice translation, it takes a relatively short time to produce as {{there is no need to}} synchronize the voices with the character's lip movements, which is compensated by the quieted original audio. When there is no speaking in the film for some time, the original sound is turned up. Recently, as more films are distributed with separate voice and noises-and-music tracks, <b>some</b> <b>voice-over</b> translations in Bulgaria are produced by only turning down the voice track, in this way not affecting the other sounds. One actor always reads the translation crew's names over the show's ending credits (except for when there are dialogs over the credits).|$|R

500|$|The {{development}} of the Neon Genesis Evangelion series ran close to deadlines throughout its production run. The initial cuts {{of the first two}} episodes were screened at the second Gainax festival in July 1995, only three months before they were aired on television. By episode 13 the series began to deviate significantly from the original story, and the initial script was abandoned. The number of Angels was reduced to 17 instead of the original 28, and the writers changed the story's ending, which had originally described the failure of the Human Instrumentality Project after an Angel attack from the moon. Starting with episode 16, the show changed drastically, discarding the grand narrative concerning salvation for a narrative focusing on the individual characters. This change coincided with Anno's {{development of}} an interest in psychology after a friend lent him a book on mental illness. This focus culminated in a psychoanalysis of the characters in the two final episodes. The production ran so close to the airing deadline that the completed scenes used in the preview of the twenty-fifth episode had to be redesigned to work with the new ending. These episodes feature heavy use of abstract animation, flashbacks, simple line drawings, photographs and fixed image scenes with <b>voice-over</b> dialogue. <b>Some</b> critics speculated that these unconventional animation choices resulted from budget cuts, but Toshio Okada stated that Anno [...] "couldn't decide the ending until the time came, that's his style". These two episodes sparked controversy and condemnation among fans and critics of the series, including significant vitriol directed at Anno himself. Hideaki Anno and Studio Gainax released in 1997, two animated feature films: [...] and The End of Evangelion.|$|R
500|$|Homer's {{voice is}} {{performed}} by Dan Castellaneta, who voices numerous other characters, including Grampa Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Barney Gumble, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby and Hans Moleman. Castellaneta {{had been part}} of the regular cast of The Tracey Ullman Show and had previously done <b>some</b> <b>voice-over</b> work in Chicago alongside his wife Deb Lacusta. Voices were needed for the Simpsons shorts, so the producers decided to ask Castellaneta and fellow cast member Julie Kavner to voice Homer and Marge rather than hire more actors. In the shorts and first few seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice is different from the majority of the series. The voice began as a loose impression of Walter Matthau, but Castellaneta could not [...] "get enough power behind that voice", or sustain his Matthau impression for the nine- to ten-hour-long recording sessions, and had to find something easier. During the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Castellaneta [...] "dropped the voice down" [...] and developed it as more versatile and humorous, allowing Homer a fuller range of emotions.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to find out how the tv-program I Zlatans fotspår (English: In Zlatan's footprints) broadcasted on Swedish public service {{television}} represent the participating young players and the Swedish football player Zlatan Ibrahimović. Our question formulation reads as follows: –        How is the participating youths being represented in the tv-program I Zlatans fotspår? –        How is the football player Zlatan Ibrahimović being represented in the tv-program I Zlatans fotspår?   Our thesis is qualitative and in order to find out how the participants are being represented we used a discourse analysis. We have focused on the theories discourse, identity, representation, stereotypes, discrimination and the perspective social constructionism. We chose to analyze some of the interviews with the young players and with Zlatan Ibrahimović. We also analyzed the voice-over that figured in the program. Worth mentioned is that we had an idea that there would be some discrimination and stereotyping in the program.   The result of our analysis shows that the <b>voice-over</b> uses <b>some</b> discriminating and stereotyping descriptions of the young players. The descriptions made by the voice-over are on the whole very inconsequent, some focus on the players’ qualities on the football pitch whilst others are about their personal qualities. In the interviews with the players these kind of values aren’t shown that explicit as in the voice-over. But the interviewer’s questions are sometimes formulated in a way that creates a distance towards the players. Moreover, there are just longer interviews with five of the nine players.   The result also shows that Zlatan Ibrahimović is being described and represented as the big star, a national hero that the young players look up to and want to be like. He has gone through the journey that awaits many of the young players and he managed to finish at the very top. Although Zlatan is being represented like this he still thinks that he has a lot left to learn and that he is far from being the complete football player...|$|R
