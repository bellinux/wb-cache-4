5|$|In {{the early}} history of the park, {{visitors}} were allowed, and sometimes even encouraged, to feed the bears. Visitors welcomed the chance to get their pictures taken with the bears, who had learned to beg for food. This led to numerous injuries to humans each year. In 1970, park officials changed their policy and started a vigorous program to educate the public on the dangers of close contact with bears, and to try to eliminate opportunities for bears to find food in campgrounds and trash collection areas. Although it has become more difficult to observe bears in recent years, the number of human injuries and deaths has taken a significant drop and <b>visitors</b> <b>are</b> in less danger. The eighth recorded bear-related death in the park's history occurred in August 2015.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the tombs}} are {{not open to}} the public (18 of the tombs can be opened, but they are rarely open at the same time), and {{officials}} occasionally close those that are open for restoration work.

The tour guides are no longer allowed to lecture inside the tombs, and <b>visitors</b> <b>are</b> expected to proceed quietly and in single file through the tombs. This is to minimize time in the tombs and prevent the crowds from damaging the surfaces of the decoration. Photography is no longer allowed in the tombs.|$|E
