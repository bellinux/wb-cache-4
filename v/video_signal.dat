5|$|Another {{hardware}} quirk produced one of {{the most}} distinctive aspects of the ZX81's screen display – during loading or saving, moving zigzag stripes appear across the screen. The same pin on the ULA is used to handle the <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> and the tape output, producing the stripes as an interference pattern of sorts. The ULA cannot maintain the display during SAVE and LOAD operations, as it has to operate continuously to maintain the correct baud rate for data transfers. The interference produces the zigzag stripes.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{introduction}} of new types of radars working on different frequencies meant the IFF system had to respond to an ever-increasing list of signals, and the direct response of the Mk. II required an ever-increasing number of sub-models, each turned to different frequencies. By 1941 {{it was clear that}} this was going to grow without bound, and a new solution was needed. The result was a new series of IFF units which used the indirect interrogation technique. These operated on a fixed frequency, different from the radar. The interrogation signal was sent from the aircraft by pressing a button on the radar, which caused the signal to be sent out in pulses synchronized to the radar's main signal. The received signal was amplified and mixed into the same <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> as the radar, causing the same extended blip to appear.|$|E

5|$|At {{the scene}} of Marks' game, Detective Allison Kerry finds a message for her former partner, Eric Matthews, and calls him in. Despite {{not wanting to be}} {{involved}} with the case, already dealing with a divorce and estrangement from his son Daniel, Eric reluctantly joins Kerry and Sergeant Daniel Rigg in leading a SWAT team to the factory which produced the lock from Marks' trap. There they find and apprehend John Kramer, the Jigsaw Killer, who is weak from cancer. He indicates several computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house; arsonist Obi Tate, his only known survivor Amanda Young, business man Gus Colyard, gangster Jonas Singer, Laura Hunter, drug dealer Xavier Chavez, prostitute Addison Corday, and Daniel. A nerve agent filling the house will kill them within two hours, but Kramer assures Eric that following his own game, simply sitting and chatting with John, will see his son Daniel returned to him unharmed. At Kerry's urging, Eric agrees in order to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the <b>video</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{agreeing on}} an initial idea, Bushnell and Dabney {{began trying to}} design a {{prototype}} based on a Data General Nova. Initially {{they were joined by}} Larry Bryan, a computer programmer who also worked at Ampex. Bushnell and Dabney put US$100 each into a partnership, named Syzygy by Bryan. They soon ran into difficulties with their planned design; the computer was not powerful enough to refresh the monitors as fast as was needed to make the game playable. Bryan realized this early on, when trying to design the code needed to run the games, and left the project before Syzygy was formed without ever contributing any money, but Bushnell and Dabney continued working on the design for several more months. The pair attempted to reduce the load on the computer by replacing subroutines—such as displaying the background stars—with specialized hardware, but it proved insufficient; even reducing the number of monitors was not enough. By the end of November 1970, Bushnell decided to abandon the project as untenable, while Dabney had stopped working on the design a while before. It is unclear if the pair were aware that Data General had demonstrated a more powerful variant of the Nova, sold for US$8,000, running a single game of Spacewar at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in December 1968, though that solution would have been too expensive for an arcade game, which typically cost US$1,000 at the time. Unable to put the game idea out of his mind, however, Bushnell soon thought of a way to manipulate the <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> on the screen without a computer controlling it, and from there Syzygy {{came up with the idea}} of removing the computer altogether and building specialized hardware to handle everything for the game instead.|$|E

50|$|SCH {{phase is}} {{important}} when merging {{two or more}} <b>video</b> <b>signals.</b> To avoid color shifts or “picture jumps,” the <b>video</b> <b>signals</b> must have the same horizontal, vertical, and subcarrier timing and the phases must be closely matched. To achieve these timing constraints, the <b>video</b> <b>signals</b> must have the same SCH phase relationship since the horizontal sync and subcarrier are continuous signals with a defined relationship. It is common for an encoder to allow adjustment of the SCH phase to simplify merging two or more <b>video</b> <b>signals.</b> Maintaining proper SCH phase is also important since NTSC and PAL decoders may monitor the SCH phase to determine which color field is being decoded.|$|R
40|$|DE 3507152 A UPAB: 19930925 Several {{subscribers}} are interconnected by {{a system}} of cameras, monitors, microphones and loudspeakers in each subscriber station. A central exchange (BZ) transmits <b>video</b> <b>signals</b> (BSq,BSs) between the cameras and monitors of the individual subscribers (SO). It comprises image memories (GSp), each associated with a subscriber during the built-up of the conference circuit. They receive the camera <b>video</b> <b>signals</b> of a complete image for further processing. A multiplexer (MUX) is also allocated to a certain subscriber for selective access to all camera <b>video</b> <b>signals</b> in the image memory. Each multiplexer supplies <b>video</b> <b>signals</b> to a specified monitor. Directional controls (BC) form specific monitor <b>video</b> <b>signals</b> from signals of individual subscribers.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{compressing}} correlated distributed <b>video</b> <b>signals</b> that are captured from a dynamic scene. The correlated <b>video</b> <b>signals</b> originate from cameras that are not co-located or that cannot cooperate to directly exploit their correlation. However, the decoder is able to exploit the coded information from all cameras to achieve the best reconstruction of the correlated <b>video</b> <b>signals.</b> Our distributed coding scheme is based on a motioncompensated lifted wavelet transform to exploit the temporal correlation of the camera signals. The correlation among the <b>video</b> <b>signals</b> is considered by coset-encoding the quantized wavelet transform coefficients. The experimental results demonstrate that conditional decoding can reduce the bit-rate of one sequence by up to 20 % when compared to independent decoding. Further, we consider theoretically the associated rate-distortion problem with side information and determine the optimal conditional KarhunenLoeve transform for video coding with side information and outline the performance bounds...|$|R

25|$|In {{television}} sets and computer monitors, the entire front {{area of the}} tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a raster. An image is produced by controlling the intensity {{of each of the}} three electron beams, one for each additive primary color (red, green, and blue) with a <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> as a reference. In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by magnetic deflection, a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although electrostatic deflection is commonly used in oscilloscopes, a type of electronic test instrument.|$|E
25|$|Baird's {{numerous}} other developments demonstrated his particular talent at invention. He was a visionary {{and began to}} dabble with electricity. In 1928, he developed an early video recording device, which he dubbed Phonovision. The system consisted of a large Nipkow disk attached by a mechanical linkage to a conventional 78-rpm record-cutting lathe. The result was a disc that could record and play back a 30-line <b>video</b> <b>signal.</b> Technical difficulties with the system prevented its further development, {{but some of the}} original phonodiscs have been preserved, and have since been restored by Donald McLean, a Scottish electrical engineer.|$|E
25|$|The {{broadcast}} or {{transport channel}} for TV {{in countries that}} use NTSC or ATSC has a bandwidth of 6MHz. To conserve bandwidth, SSB would be desirable, but the <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> has significant low-frequency content (average brightness) and has rectangular synchronising pulses. The engineering compromise is vestigial-sideband transmission. In vestigial sideband, the full upper sideband of bandwidth W2 = 4.75MHz is transmitted, but only W1 = 1.25MHz of the lower sideband is transmitted, along with a carrier. This effectively makes the system AM at low modulation frequencies and SSB at high modulation frequencies. The absence of the lower sideband components at high frequencies must be compensated for, and this {{is done by the}} RF and IF filters.|$|E
