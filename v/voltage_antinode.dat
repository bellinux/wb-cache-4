40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design and}} characterization of superconducting coplanar waveguide cavities tailored to facilitate strong coupling between superconducting quantum circuits and single trapped Rydberg atoms. For initial superconductor-atom experiments at 4. 2 K, we show that resonator quality factors above 10 ^ 4 can be readily achieved. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the incorporation of thick-film copper electrodes at a <b>voltage</b> <b>antinode</b> of the resonator provides a route to enhance the zero-point electric fields of the resonator in a trapping region that is 40 Î¼m above the chip surface, thereby minimizing chip heating from scattered trap light. The combination of high resonator quality factor and strong electric dipole coupling between the resonator and the atom should {{make it possible to}} achieve the strong coupling limit of cavity quantum electrodynamics with this system.

40|$|A long antenna {{consisting}} of two parallel wires {{is connected to the}} radio transmitter of Demonstration 11, as shown in Figure 1. This system, called "Lecher Wires," is used to show the standing electromagnetic waves in the antenna. The contacts of a small incandescent bulb are connected to two heavy rods so this probe can be slid along the antenna with one rod contacting each of the two antenna wires. The small light glows brightly at the <b>voltage</b> <b>antinodes</b> along the antenna and does not glow at all at the voltage nodes. A graphics section illustrates the complete standing wave pattern...|$|R
2500|$|Horizontal wire dipole antennas {{are popular}} {{for use on}} the HF shortwave bands, both for {{transmitting}} and shortwave listening. [...] They are usually constructed of two lengths of wire joined by a strain insulator in the center, which is the feedpoint. The ends can be attached to existing buildings, structures, or trees, taking advantage of their heights. If used for transmitting, {{it is essential that}} the ends of the antenna be attached to supports through strain insulators with a sufficiently high flashover voltage, since the antenna's high <b>voltage</b> <b>antinodes</b> occur there. Being a balanced antenna, they are best fed with a balun between the (coax) transmission line and the feedpoint.|$|R
40|$|A {{metal sheet}} {{placed in front}} of the {{microwave}} transmitter of Demonstration 14 reflects the microwaves backward at an angle of 180 ? to form standing waves. A diode is used as the receiver probe. When the probe is moved along the line between the transmitter and the metal plate, it indicates the standing waves by responding to the intensity of the microwave signal at each point, as shown on the bar graph and in Figure 1. The bar graph indicates its maximum at <b>voltage</b> <b>antinodes</b> and virtually zero at voltage nodes in the standing wave. Using a graphic distance scale overlay on the video, the loop length of the microwave standing wave can be determined, from which the wavelength can be calculated as twice the loop length...|$|R
