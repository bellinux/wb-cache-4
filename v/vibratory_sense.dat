50|$|Symptoms {{depend on}} the type of HSP inherited. The main feature of the disease is {{progressive}} spasticity in the lower limbs, due to pyramidal tract dysfunction. This also results in brisk reflexes, extensor plantar reflexes, muscle weakness, and variable bladder disturbances. Furthermore, among the core symptoms of HSP are also included abnormal gait and difficulty in walking, decreased <b>vibratory</b> <b>sense</b> at the ankles, and paresthesia.Initial symptoms are typically difficulty with balance, stubbing the toe or stumbling. Symptoms of HSP may begin at any age, from infancy to older than 60 years. If symptoms begin during the teenage years or later, then spastic gait disturbance usually progresses over many years. Canes, walkers, and wheelchairs may eventually be required, although some people never require assistance devices.More specifically, patients with the autosomal dominant pure form of HSP reveal normal facial and extraocular movement. Although jaw jerk may be brisk in older subjects, there is no speech disturbance or difficulty of swallowing. Upper extremity muscle tone and strength are normal. In the lower extremities, muscle tone is increased at the hamstrings, quadriceps and ankles. Weakness is most notable at the iliopsoas, tibialis anterior, and to a lesser extent, hamstring muscles.In the complex form of the disorder, additional symptoms are present. These include: peripheral neuropathy, amyotrophy, ataxia, mental retardation, ichthyosis, epilepsy, optic neuropathy, dementia, deafness, or problems with speech, swallowing or breathing.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Each papilla in an {{enlarged}} {{photograph of the}} tip of the tongue was identified electrically as belonging to one of the four basic taste sensations. The temperature coefficient of the threshold for electrical stimulation was observed for single papillae. The results seem to divide the four basic taste sensations into two different groups: sour-salty and sweet-bitter. This is the same division that has been reported with other methods. METHODS OF DETERMINING THE TASTE THRESHOLD Investigating the threshold for chemical stimulation of the tongue, we found that threshold observation for chemical taste sensations is more difficult than analogous measurements for hearing and the <b>vibratory</b> <b>senses.</b> The main difficulty is the adaptation of taste sensations. The smallest chemical stimulus presented to the tongue immediately raises the threshold (Bdkdsy, 1965), {{and it is difficult to}} follow this rise. Adaptation depends on concentration, presentation time, temperature, etc. The threshold observations become unreliable, mainly because of the difficulty of making sure that it is always exactly the same group of papillae that is being stimulated.

Th e girl had unstable gait with incoordination of limb movements, impairment of position and <b>vibratory</b> <b>senses,</b> dysarthria, pes cavus, positive Babinski sign and scoliosis. At the age of fourteen the girl was referred in a comatose condition, in a severe diabetic ketoacidosis. Ataxia and hypoactive knee and ankle jerks prompted {{the analysis of the}} frataxin gene (FXN;). Th e most common mo-lecular abnormality: GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in intron was found with + GAA repeats (bp) (normal individuals have to GAA repeat expansions, whereas aff ected indi-viduals have from to more than, GAA triplets). Electrocardiogram showed diff use T wave inversion with sinus bradycardia, while ultrasound revealed concentric, symmetric hypertrophy of left ventricle leading to the diagnosis of hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy. At the age of years, the patient was bound to the wheel-chair, unable to walk. Her brother started to show ataxia at the age of years, and subsequent analysis showed hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy, too. His muta-tional analysis revealed the same frataxin abnormality, with + GAA repeats. So far, no signs of diabetes occurred. Th e parents are heterozygous with FXN of - GAA (bp). Both children received a beta blocker, while the girl’s diabetes mellitus was treated by insulin preparations.

40|$|Mutation in the SPAST (SPG 4) gene is {{the single}} most common cause for {{hereditary}} spastic paraplegia (HSP) and accounts for 40 % of autosomal dominant cases of HSP (Hazan et al. 1999; Fonknechten et al. 2000; Lindsey et al. 2000). The SPG 4 subtype is considered as pure form of HSP and clinically characterized by lower limb spasticity, weak-ness, hyperreflexia, and often mild <b>vibratory</b> <b>sense</b> impair-ment in the toes (Harding 1983; Fink 2003). The SPAST gene encodes for spastin protein, which belongs to the ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAA) family of proteins (Patel and Latterich 1998; Hanson and Whiteheart 2005).

40|$|The medical {{examinations}} of chain-saw operators {{were carried out}} {{in accordance with the}} notification of the Labor Ministry. The total subjects of the chain-saw operators examined were 255, from whom the control group, consisting of 66 subjects who did not complain of symptoms caused by Raynaud's phenomenon {{and at the same time}} had nothing abnormal in the {{medical examinations}}, was selected out and compared with the patients group, consisting of 119 subjects who complained of the same symptoms and also had something abnormal in the examinations. All the parameters obtained were changed for normal distribution. In the comparison between the above two groups, all the indices indicated the statistical significance. False negative rate, however, showed the range from 21. 8 % (<b>vibratory</b> <b>sense</b> threshold at 5 min. after cold immersion) to 59. 1 % (value of nail press test before immersion). Since the false negative rate obtained from the above data showed an unexpected value, the diagnosis of vibration disease based on the tentative criteria of each index may lead to erroneous results. Therefore, this discriminant analysis aimed at an objective diagnosis by using the eighteen indices including the function of peripheral circulation, peripheral nerve and age. The results can be summarized as follows. 1. The theoretical error was 8. 9 %. 2. Only one subject of the control group was recognized as having the symptoms of white finger. 3. In 119 subjects belonging to the white finger group, fourteen were recognized as not having white finger. Among those fourteen : a) There were six subjects who used to have the symptoms of white finger but none at present. b) There were five subjects who suffered from white finger symptoms at times, but whose symptoms seemed to have been caused by the injuries received before. c) Unknown origin (3 subjects) 4.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research work carried out was the development of techniques useful in automated assembly. In particular, methods were sought which would allow the extension of simple robot capabilities from the "pick and place" function to the less ordered domain of assembly. Three approaches towards correcting the gross misalignment of a peg and hole are described. An established method of facilitating assembly involves the vibration of the contacting misaligned components. This technique was studied {{with respect to the}} behaviour of an elastically constrained peg under the action of a rotating force. The study was limited initially to a relatively straightforward analysis of simplified situations, then, in order to allow the prediction of the behaviour of practical systems a program was developed which simulated the behaviour of a general nine degree-of-freedom assembly system. This work led to the second approach where the possibility of using the vibrational motion of the contacting components as feedback for position sensing was investigated. The third technique involved determining the spatial relationship between the components on the basis of contact forces sensed in their respective coordinate systems. Finally a six degree-of-freedom force-displacement sensor, able to be used for, either <b>vibratory</b> position <b>sensing,</b> or contact force position sensing, was developed...|$|R
30|$|Hall et al. (1995) {{was among}} the first to study {{proprioception}} in HMS patients by examining the knee joint. Using a threshold-detection paradigm in which participants indicated when they could feel movement in the knee joint and were asked to report the direction of the movement, the study revealed that hypermobile subjects showed significantly higher threshold detection levels at knee flexion angles of 5 ° and 30 ° in comparison to age and gender-matched control subjects. These findings are similar to those reported by Sahin et al. (2008) who found that HMS patients had significantly higher absolute angular errors than age and gender-matched control subjects during a knee joint matching task. Rombaut et al. (2010 a) later compared proprioceptive abilities and <b>vibratory</b> perception <b>sense</b> in EDS hypermobility type patients to those of age and gender-matched controls. Exploring proprioception in the knee and shoulder using both an active and passive joint matching paradigm, they found that EDS patients showed significantly larger angular errors in joint matching at the knee joint, but not at the shoulder. However, they also found that EDS patients could detect tactile stimuli just as well as controls (using vibratory perception threshold at these same joints), suggesting that cutaneous receptors in the skin may not be contributing to the observed proprioceptive deficit in EDS; it could be that tendon and joint receptors are the most likely contributors to the proprioceptive impairment found in EDS (Hall et al. 1995; Sahin et al. 2008; Rombaut et al. 2010 a).|$|R
40|$|Neurophysiological deficits {{could make}} {{patients}} with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) type III (hypermobility type) {{more vulnerable to}} musculoskeletal problems, particularly to joint instability. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether joint position <b>sense</b> (JPS) and <b>vibratory</b> perception <b>sense</b> (VPS) in EDS type III patients in the knee and shoulder joints are impaired. Thirty-two female EDS type III patients as defined by the Villefranche criteria and 32 individually gender- and age-matched healthy control subjects were included in the study. Range of motion was determined using a goniometer, passive and active JPS were assessed with an isokinetic dynamometer system, and the VPS was measured by a biothesiometer. Daily physical activity was evaluated by the Baecke questionnaire. The EDS type III group showed significantly larger ranges of movement (P < 0. 05) and lower levels of sport physical activity (SPA) compared to the control group (P = 0. 023). Considering SPA as covariate, the EDS type III group demonstrated a significant impairment in knee joint reposition compared to the control group (P = 0. 018). No significant differences were found for shoulder JPS. The VPS was not significantly different in the EDS type III group compared to the control group. In addition, no significant correlation was found between JPS and VPS, neither at the knee nor at the shoulder joint. This is the first study examining proprioception deficits in EDS type III patients as defined by the Villefranche criteria.

Neuropathy can be divided into two major types: focal mononeuritis and diffuse polyneuropathy. Symptoms of neuropathy present in many different ways depending on the types of nerve fibers affected. Large nerve fiber neuropathies present with symptoms such as weakness, muscle wasting, deficits in proprioception, deep tendon reflexes and <b>vibratory</b> <b>sense.</b> Small nerve fiber neuropathies present with alterations to heat, cold and pain sensations. Neuropathic pain has been described as intolerable burning, crushing, searing, stabbing, stinging, pins and needles, aching, and electrical shocks. Peripheral neuropathy has a variety of causes such as entrapment, ischemia, hereditary disorders, systemic and metabolic disease, vitamin deficiency, and toxic exposure making an accurate diagnosis difficult.

40|$|Background: The prevalence, predictors, and {{consequences}} of peripheral neuropathy in the elderly have not been well defined. Methods: Seven hundred ninety-five noninstitutionalized patients 65 {{years of age and}} older, re-cruited from the practices of family physicians, completed questionnaires and underwent peripheral neurologic examinations and tests of gait and balance. Variables included sociodemographic informa-tion, medical conditions, symptoms (numbness, pain, trouble with balance or walking, and restless legs), quality of life measures, ankle reflexes, position sense, <b>vibratory</b> <b>sense,</b> fine touch sensation, Tinnetti balance examination, and a 50 -foot timed walk. Results: The prevalence of at least one bilateral sensory deficit rose from 26 % for 65 - to 74 -year-olds to 54 % for those 85 and older. The most common deficit was loss of ankle reflex followed by loss of fine touch. Only 40 % of those with bilateral deficits reported having a disease known to cause periph-eral neuropathy. Predictors of bilateral deficits included increasing age, income less than $ 15, 000, a history of military service, increasing body mass index, self-reported history of diabetes mellitus, Vita-min B 12 deficiency or rheumatoid arthritis, and absence of a history of hypertension.

40|$|The {{genetic and}} {{clinical}} features of 46 patients in nine families with "pure" {{hereditary spastic paraplegia}} are described. Inheritance was autosomal dominant in seven families and autosomal recessive in two. In dominant kinships, five families corresponded to type I with onset below 35 years, and two to type II with onset over 35 years. In early onset dominant families, in spite of apparent complete penetrance before 20, variable expression and incomplete penetrance occurred. Irrespective of genetic type, serial evaluation revealed that the main symptom consisted of slowly progressive spastic gait, extremely variable in severity, associated in some patients with decreased <b>vibratory</b> <b>sense</b> and micturition disorders generally as late features. In dominant families, the disease {{tended to be more}} severe in late onset cases. No patient had symptoms in the upper limbs and plantar responses were flexor in six symptomatic patients. Central motor conduction time studied by transcranial magnetic stimulation was always normal in the upper limbs and increased in the lower limbs in five of the eight patients on whom it was performed.

40|$|The figure {{depicts a}} micromachined silicon <b>vibratory</b> {{gyroscope}} that <b>senses</b> rotation about its z axis. The rotation-sensitive vibratory element is a post oriented (when at equilibrium) along the z axis and suspended {{at its base}} by thin, flexible silicon bands oriented along the x and y axes, respectively. Unlike in the vibratory microgyroscopes described in the immediately preceding article ["Cloverleaf Vibratory Microgyroscope With Integrated Post" (NPO- 20688) ] and other previous articles in NASA Tech Briefs, the rotation-sensitive vibratory element does not include a cloverleaf-shaped structure that lies (when at equilibrium) in the x-y plane. As {{in the cases of}} the previously reported vibratory microgyroscopes, vibrations of the rotation-sensitive vibratory element are excited electrostatically, the vibrations are measured by use of capacitive proximity sensors, and the rate of rotation along the axis of sensitivity is deduced from the effect of the Coriolis force upon the vibrations. To create electrodes for electrostatic excitation and capacitive sensing of vibrations, portions of the facing surfaces of the post and of the four stationary members that surround the post are rendered electrically conductive; this can be accomplished by either depositing metal films or else doping the silicon in the affected areas...|$|R

Although both of these diseases are considered autoimmune diseases, psoriasis with concomitant myelin-associated glycoprotein-related neuropathy is very rare. Here, we report a case of myelin-associated glycoprotein-related neuropathy associated with psoriasis. Case presentation A 66 -year-old Japanese man, having experienced sternocostoclavicular pain for ten years, was admitted to our hospital because of gait disturbance and numbness of the limbs. Our patient had normal cranial nerve function and normal limb muscle strength. His <b>vibratory</b> and position <b>sense</b> was severely impaired and his touch, temperature and pinprick sensations were mildly disturbed in a glove and stocking distribution. A myelin-associated glycoprotein western blot analysis showed {{the presence of a}} 91 to 94 kDa band using purified human myelin-associated glycoprotein antigen. His skin lesions were moderately pruritic and Auspitz’s sign was positive. Our patient also showed osteitis of his clavicle and manubrium. We diagnosed our patient with myelin-associated glycoprotein-related neuropathy associated with psoriatic arthritis. Five days after intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, his deep sensory impairment began to improve and his sternocostoclavicular pain diminished dramatically. Conclusions Because myelin-associated glycoprotein-related neuropathy and psoriatic arthritis are both considered autoimmune diseases, we conclude that intravenous immunoglobulin therapy is very effective for patients with an association of these diseases. </p...|$|R
40|$|Much recent {{discussion}} of consciousness takes {{the view that}} it is unified, i. e. our perceptions, memories, thoughts and beliefs {{come together in a}} singular phenomenal experience. This has led some researchers to seek a specific neural mechanism to account for this unity. At the same time it is frequently assumed this unified experience is essentially rational – that the perceptions, thoughts and beliefs of which we are aware must be logically coherent in order for our mental life to make sense. In this paper I will question both of these views. Using an example of my experience when studying a painting, I will argue that my perceptions and beliefs are as much fragmentary and contradictory as they are unified and rational, consisting of quite distinct percepts and often incompatible thoughts. I will suggest that this multiplicity and inconsistency contribute in some way to the peculiar <b>vibratory</b> <b>sense</b> of lived experience, and that the conscious mind might be best characterised as a ‘fractured unity’. The predisposition towards unitary and non-contradictory models of consciousness in the European tradition will be contrasted with alternative approaches found in some Indian philosophical systems, such as Buddhism and Jainism, which embrace pluralistic views of reality and non-binary logical states.

Common neuro-logical signs are limb and truncal ataxia, dysarthria, areflexia of the lower extremities; pyramidal signs, loss of position and <b>vibratory</b> <b>sense</b> evolve gradually. Distal amyotrophy, horizontal nystagmus and optic atrophy are less common. Non-neuro-logical features include kyphoscoliosis, pes cavus and cardio-myopathy. Pathological features of FA are narrowed spinal cord with cell loss and gliosis in the spinocerebellar and corticospinal tracts and in the posterior column, Clarke's column and depleted dorsal root ganglia, such as cranial nerve nuclei VIII, X and XII. Large myelinated peripheral nerves are lost, and myocardial fibers degenerated. We treated a 16 -year-old male affected by FA, who suffers from a stage IIA bulky lymphoblastic T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with mediastinal presentation.

Physiotherapists have {{a key role in}} this health setting. Objectives To implement actions of evaluation and guidelines for patients with type 2 DM who attend a Family Health Strategy (FHS), regarding diabetic foot and the practice of regular physical exercise in the control and prevention of the complications of Diabetes Mellitus. Methods 17 individuals from an FHS were evaluated, with the following procedures: clinical and anthropometric parameters, inspection, a questionnaire on diabetic neuropathy, tests of vibratory and tactile sensitivity, muscle function, range of motion, functional analysis, questions about exercise practice and guidance regarding controlling blood glucose and foot care. Results Deformities, dry skin, calluses, dehydration, ulceration, cracking and brittle nails were found. Peripheral neuropathy was not observed; tactile sensitivity was altered in the heel region and the <b>vibratory</b> <b>sense</b> was absent in 5 % of individuals. A decrease in functionality of ankle movements was verified. Of the participants, 76 % were sedentary, 24 % knew about the benefits of practicing regular exercise, 25 % had undergone a medical evaluation prior to performing physical exercise and, of these, 25 % were supervised by a qualified professional.

40|$|Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an {{autosomal}} recessive inherited disorder characterized by progressive gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, areflexia, loss of <b>vibratory</b> and position <b>sense,</b> and a progressive motor weakness of central origin. Additional features include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and diabetes. Large GAA repeat expansions {{in the first}} intron of the FXN gene {{are the most common}} mutation underlying FRDA. Patients show severely reduced levels of a FXN-encoded mitochondrial protein called frataxin. Frataxin deficiency is associated with abnormalities of iron metabolism: decreased iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis, accumulation of iron in mitochondria and depletion in the cytosol, enhanced cellular iron uptake. Some models have also shown reduced heme synthesis. Evidence for oxidative stress has been reported. Respiratory chain dysfunction aggravates oxidative stress by increasing leakage of electrons and the formation of superoxide. In vitro studies have demonstrated that Frataxin deficient cells not only generate more free radicals, but also show a reduced capacity to mobilize antioxidant defenses. The search for experimental drugs increasing the amount of frataxin is a very active and timely area of investigation. In cellular and in animal model systems, the replacement of frataxin function seems to alleviate the symptoms or even completely reverse the phenotype. Therefore, drugs increasing the amount of frataxin are attractive candidates for novel therapies. This review will discuss recent findings on FRDA pathogenesis, frataxin function, new treatments, as well as recent animal and cellular models. Controversial aspects are also discussed.

40|$|A {{modified}} {{design and}} fabrication sequence has been devised {{to improve the}} performance of a cloverleaf vibratory microgyroscope that includes an axial rod or post rigidly attached {{to the center of the}} cloverleaf structure. The basic concepts of cloverleaf vibratory microgyroscopes, without and with rods or posts, were described in two prior articles in NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 21, No. 9 (September 1997) : Micromachined Planar Vibratory Microgyroscopes (NPO- 19713), page 68 and Planar Vibratory Microgyroscope: Alternative Configuration (NPO- 19714), page 70. As described in more detail in the second-mentioned prior article, the cloverleaf-shaped structure and the rod or post are parts of a <b>vibratory</b> element that <b>senses</b> rotation via the effect of the Coriolis force upon its vibrations. Heretofore, the posts for devices of this type have been fabricated separately, then assembled manually onto the cloverleaf structures. The resulting imperfections in the assembled units have given rise to asymmetric stresses in the cloverleaf structures and, consequently, to changes in resonant frequencies of vibration and in shapes of vibration modes. These changes, in turn, have caused variations in performance among nominally identical devices. The modified design provides for the fabrication of the upper half of the post as an integral part of the cloverleaf structure; this is accomplished by reactive-ion etching of a single-piece half-post-and-cloverleaf structure from a wafer of silicon. The lower half of the post and a baseplate are also a single piece made by reactive-ion etching from a wafer of silicon. The two pieces are bonded together (see figure) by a thermal-compression metal-to-metal bonding technique to form a cloverleaf gyroscope with an integrated post structure. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of inertial grade gyroscopes for space applications represents well over 50 years of technology development and {{an investment of}} {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars. The workhorse product which represents the current state-of-the art for commercially available high performance devices is the Litton-Hemishperical Resonator Gyro (HRG) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). This product has a performance figure of merit of 0. 003 deg/hr bias drift, a volume of 567 cubic inches, weighs 19 pounds, draws about 30 watts and costs over $ 1 million each. Clearly devices of this magnitude are not conducive to the minimized mass, volume, power, and cost constraints of outer planet missions. An approach to breaking these potential barriers is the use of Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) based inertial devices. Although substantially reduced in size, mass power and cost, this approach has produced devices in the tactical performance range of greater than 1 deg/hour bias drift. This level of performance satisfies the preponderance of high market volume requirements such as automotive and tactical munitions but does not meet the limited market quantity requirements for the high precision space based market. Because of the very limited size of the space based market, there is little economic incentive for commercial fabricators of tactical grade devices to address the necessary performance improvements. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in conjunction with Boeing Space Systems (BSS) is addressing this void to satisfy our mutual requirements in this area. The project objective to is to achieve 0. 01 deg/hr performance in an IMU which is less than 10 cubic inches in volume, weighs less than 0. 5 pounds, draws less than 1 watt and is available in volume production for less than $ 2500. Reductions of this magnitude will be mission enabling capabilities for a variety of anticipated outer planet mission attributes such as autonomous control and docking, formation flying and robotic outposts. The improved performance will be realized using improved relative precision fabrication, enhanced <b>vibratory</b> drive and <b>sense</b> designs, and statistical data analysis...|$|R
40|$|Methyl bromide is {{a highly}} toxic gas with poor {{olfactory}} warning properties. It is widely used as insecticidal fumigant for dry foodstuffs and can be toxic to central and peripheral nervous systems. Most neurological manifestations of methyl bromide intoxication occur from inhalation. Acute toxicity characterized by headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and visual disturbances. Tremor, convulsion, un-consciousness and permanent brain damage may occur in severe poisoning. Chronic exposure can cause neuropathy, pyramidal and cerebellar dysfunction, as well as neuropsychiatric disturbances. The first case of methyl bromide intoxication in Thailand has been described.

40|$|Objective: To study whether {{clinical}} characteristics can differentiate sporadic {{presentations of}} hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP) from {{primary lateral sclerosis}} (PLS). Differentiation between these diseases is important for genetic counseling and prognostication. Design: Case series. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: One hundred four Dutch patients with an adult-onset, sporadic upper motor neuron syndrome of at least 3 years' duration. Hereditary spastic paraparesis was genetically confirmed in 14 patients (7 with SPG 4 and 7 with SPG 7 mutations). Results: All 14 patients with the SPG 4 or SPG 7 mutation had symptom onset in the legs, and 1 of the patients with the SPG 7 mutation also developed symptoms in the arms. Of the other 90 patients, 78 (87 %) had symptom onset in the legs. Thirty-six patients developed a PLS phenotype (bulbar region involvement), 15 had a phenotype that was difficult to classify as similar to HSP or PLS (involvement of legs and arms only), and 39 continued to have a phenotype similar to typical HSP (involvement of the legs only). Median age at onset was lower in patients with the SPG 4 or SPG 7 mutation (39 [range, 29 - 69] years), but there was considerable overlap with patients with the PLS phenotype (52 [range, 32 - 76] years). No {{differences were found in}} the features used by previous studies to distinguish HSP from PLS, including evidence of mild dorsal column impairment (decreased <b>vibratory</b> <b>sense</b> or abnormal leg somatosensory evoked potentials), symptoms of urinary urgency, or mild electromyographic abnormalities. Conclusions: In most patients with a sporadic adult-onset upper motor neuron syndrome, differentiation of sporadic presentations of HSP from PLS based on clinical characteristics is unreliable and therefore depends on results of genetic testin...|$|E
40|$|Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is an {{autosomal}} recessive inherited disorder affecting approximately 1 every 40, 000 individuals in Western Europe, {{is characterized by}} progressive gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, areflexia, loss of <b>vibratory</b> and position <b>sense,</b> and a progressive weakness of central origin. Additional features particularly include an hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that can cause premature death. A large GAA repeat expansion in the first intron of the FXN gene {{is the most common}} mutation underlying FRDA. Patients show severely reduced levels of the FXN-encoded mitochondrial protein frataxin. Frataxin function is not yet completely elucidated. In frataxin deficiency conditions abnormalities of iron metabolism occur: decreased activities of iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) containing proteins, accumulation of iron in mitochondria and depletion in the cytosol, enhanced cellular iron uptake, and, in some models, reduced heme synthesis. Evidence of oxidative stress has also been found in most though not all models of frataxin deficiency. Accordingly, yfh 1 -deficient yeast and cells from FRDA patients are highly sensitive to oxidants. Respiratory chain dysfunction further aggravate oxidative stress by increasing leakage of electrons and the formation of superoxide. Frataxin deficient cells not only generate more free radicals, but, they also show a reduced ability to mobilize antioxidant defenses, in particular to induce superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD 2). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) isoform-gamma {{play a key role in}} numerous cellular functions and is a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and of the ROS metabolism. Recruitment of the PPAR coactivator- 1 a (PGC- 1 a) mediates many effects of the PPAR-γ activation. In a first work we assessed the potential beneficial effects of a potent PPAR-gamma agonist on frataxin expression in primary fibroblasts from healthy controls and FRDA patients, and Neuroblastoma cells. We used the APAF molecule (1 - 0 -hexadecyl- 2 -azelaoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocoline; C 33 H 66 NO 9 P). Our results show that this compound is able to increase frataxin amount both at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. At a dose of 20 µM frataxin mRNA significantly increases in both controls (p= 0. 03) and FRDA patients (p= 0. 002) fibroblasts (1). The finding was confirmed in Neuroblastoma cells (p= 0. 042). According to previous publications APAF, as others PPAR-gamma agonists is able to up-regulate PGC- 1 a transcription. In a second part of the study we investigate the role of the PPAR-gamma/PGC- 1 a pathway in the pathogenesis of FRDA. We performed a microarray analysis of heart and skeletal muscle in a mouse model of frataxin deficiency and we found molecular evidence of increased lipogenesis in skeletal muscle and alteration of fiber-type composition in heart, consistent with insulin resistance and cardiomyopathy, respectively. Since the PPAR-gamma pathway is known to regulate both processes, we hypothesized that dysregulation of this pathway could play a key role in frataxin deficiency. We confirmed this by showing a coordinate dysregulation of Pgc 1 a and the transcription factor Srebp 1 in cellular and animal models of frataxin deficiency, and in cells from FRDA patients, who have marked insulin resistance. Particularly, PGC- 1 a was found significantly reduced (2) in primary fibroblasts and lymphocytes from FRDA patients (p Taken together those data indicate that some mechanism directly links an early effect of frataxin deficiency with reduced PGC- 1 a transcription in this cell type, and presumably in other cells that also down-regulate PGC- 1 α when frataxin levels are low. Finally, since PGC- 1 a has also emerged as a key factor in the induction of many antioxidant programs in response to oxidative stress, both in vivo and in vitro, in particular in neurons, we tested whether the PGC- 1 a down-regulation occurring in FRDA cells could be in part responsible for the blunted antioxidant response observed in frataxin deficiency. Using primary fibroblasts from FRDA patients we found reduced SOD 2 levels (p< 0. 05), according to PGC 1 &Doctorat en Sciences biomédicales et pharmaceutiquesinfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective Vibratory {{perception}} threshold (VPT) is impaired {{in patients}} with knee osteoarthritis (OA). It is, however, not known if sensory deficits precede or follow {{as a consequence of}} OA. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate VPT in 2 independent groups of patients with high risk of future OA (young anterior cruciate ligament [ACL]-injured patients and middle-aged meniscectomized patients) and compare them to age-matched controls. Methods. VPT was assessed at the medial malleolus (MM) and medial femoral condyle (MFC) in 2 independent groups of patients and matched controls: ACL- injured patients (n = 39, mean +/- SD age 24. 0 +/- 5. 2 years, mean +/- SD BMI 24. 0 +/- 2. 9 kg/m(2), mean +/- SD time since injury 21. 9 +/- 21. 6 months) and controls (n = 28, mean +/- SD age 25. 6 +/- 4. 4 years, mean +/- SD BMI 23. 6 +/- 2. 2 kg/m(2)), and meniscectomized patients (n = 22, mean +/- SD age 49. 6 +/- 4. 8 years, mean +/- SD BMI 24. 7 +/- 2. 7 kg/m(2), mean +/- SD time since surgery 49. 6 +/- 5. 0 months) and controls (n = 25, mean +/- SD age 49. 4 +/- 5. 2 years, mean +/- SD BMI 25. 2 +/- 4. 9 kg/m(2)). Results. ACL- injured patients had a better VPT than controls at the MM (P = 0. 030), which persisted after adjusting for age and sex (P = 0. 034). At the MFC, there was a similar trend in favor of ACL injured patients (unadjusted P = 0. 093, adjusted P = 0. 122). No differences were seen in VPT at theMMbetween meniscectomized patients and controls, whereas there was a tendency for better VPT in meniscectomized patients at the MFC (unadjusted P = 0. 085, adjusted P = 0. 092). Conclusion. Impaired vibratory sensation could not be confirmed in 2 independent groups of patients compared to age-matched controls, suggesting that impaired <b>vibratory</b> <b>sense</b> is not present in knee- injured patients at high risk or in the very early phase of knee OA...|$|E
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} based on three studies that {{research}} different aspects of fine texture perception. The goal is {{to better understand the}} mechanisms involved in haptic perception of textures below 200 µm, also known as microtextures. Study I was conducted to establish a friction measurement model and relating the friction measurements to perceived coarseness of fine textures. A set of printing papers was used as stimulus material. In Study II an expanded set, including the set of Study I, was used as stimuli in a multidimensional scaling (MDS) experiment of haptic fine texture perception. Through scaling of perceptual attributes and similarities, a three dimensional space was found to best describe the data and the dimensions were interpreted as rough-smooth, thick-thin and distinct-indistinct. In Study III a series of model surfaces were manufactured with a systematically varied sinusoidal pattern, spanning from 300 nm to 80 µm. As in Study II, a similarity experiment was conducted and a two dimensional space was chosen, the dimensions of which were explained well through friction and the wavelength. Together these three studies form a better picture of fine texture perception. The dimensionality found with paper stimuli was very similar to the corresponding spaces for marcrotextures of everyday materials, even though a different perceptual system is used for fine texture perception. Regardless if the information is coded through the spatial or the <b>vibratory</b> <b>sense,</b> the perception does not seem to differ in dimensionality. Further, the largest among the microtextures seem to have been perceived as carrying spatial information. On the systematically varied, rigid, textures, the MDS space did not come out in a similar fashion to those of everyday materials but instead similar to the physical properties that characterizes the change in the textures. It was further found that the participants in Study III successfully discriminated textures with an amplitude of 13 nm from the unwrinkled surfaces. From these studies the main conclusions are (a) haptically measured friction and surface roughness are important contributors to fine texture perception, (b) even at microscales, spatial information is retrieved haptically, probably through vibrations, and (c) persons can haptically discriminate textures at a nanoscale...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundThe {{increased}} {{incidence and}} geographic expansion of Lyme disease {{has made it}} the most common vector-borne infection in North America. Posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) represents a subset of patients who remain ill following standard antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease. The spectrum of symptoms {{and their impact on}} quality of life remain largely unexplored among patients with well-documented PTLDS. ObjectiveTo characterize a case series of patients with well-documented PTLDS compared to a sample of healthy controls. MethodsSixty-one participants met the proposed case definition for PTLDS. Twenty-six healthy controls had neither a clinical history of Lyme disease nor current antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi. Participants with PTLDS and controls were evaluated by physical exam, clinical laboratory testing, standardized questionnaires, and a 36 -item current symptom list. ResultsCompared to controls, participants with PTLDS reported significantly greater fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, and depression (Fatigue Severity Scale: 50. 0 [*]±[*] 10. 6 vs. 19. 8 [*]±[*] 8. 6; Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire: 13. 7 [*]±[*] 8. 3 vs. 0. 8 [*]±[*] 1. 9; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: 10. 1 [*]±[*] 4. 7 vs. 4. 1 [*]±[*] 2. 1; Beck Depression Inventory-II: 15. 1 [*]±[*] 7. 7 vs. 2. 2 [*]±[*] 3. 2; p[*]<[*] 0. 001 for each), and significantly lower quality of life (SF- 36 Physical Component Score: 33. 9 [*]±[*] 9. 7 vs. 55. 1 [*]±[*] 6. 2; Mental Component Score: 42. 9 [*]±[*] 10. 1 vs. 54. 2 [*]±[*] 5. 4; p[*]<[*] 0. 001 for each). Nineteen non-PTLDS-defining symptoms were found to be significantly more severe among participants with PTLDS than controls, including sleep difficultly and visual complaints. Initial delayed or misdiagnosis was characterized in 59. 0 % of participants with PTLDS, and 32. 2 % had abnormal <b>vibratory</b> <b>sense.</b> ConclusionAlthough physical exam and clinical laboratory tests showed few objective abnormalities, standardized symptom questionnaires revealed that patients with PTLDS are highly and clinically significantly symptomatic, with poor health-related quality of life. PTLDS patients exhibited levels of fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, sleep disturbance, and depression which were both clinically relevant and statistically significantly higher than controls. Our study shows that PTLDS can be successfully identified using a systematic approach to diagnosis and symptom measurement. As the prevalence of PTLDS continues to rise, there will be an increased need for physician education to more effectively identify and manage PTLDS as part of integrated patient care...|$|E
40|$|Are {{anti-vibration}} gloves {{the solution to}} the problem of hand-arm vibration?Vibrations from hand-held machinery are a major problem in the Swedish labour force. In 2009, 14 % of men and 3 % of women of employed in Sweden reported exposure to hand-arm vibration at least a quarter of their working time according to the Swedish Work Environment Authority (Arbetsmiljöverket 2010). It is tempting to imagine a protective glove that could reduce or even eliminate this problem. Research can validate the quality of labour protection gear available on the market and then make recommendations and suggestions for improvements. This report from the Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine in Lund and Gothenburg describes how {{anti-vibration gloves}} (AVGs) are experienced, and how they work and affect the exposure from hand-held machines. BackgroundToday, gloves labelled “anti-vibration” (AV) are advertised as “reducing vibration by 40 %”. To be marketed as “AVG”, a glove must be CE-certified and thereby comply with the requirements of International Organization for Standardization standard ISO 10819. The requirements apply only to the suppression of vibration in the palm of the hand, while in many work situations, vibration is transmitted to the fingers. However, in the ISO standard it is pointed out that AVGs provide inadequate damping of vibrations of low frequencies. Such vibrations are common in many hand-held tools and machines in industry and crafts, such as different types of grinders. Some regular protective gloves can even provide amplification of low frequencies but cannot be approved in accordance with this standard. Generally, all protective equipment disrupts work to a greater or lesser degree. Working without a helmet, protective mask, hearing protection and protective clothing is preferred in most situations. Furthermore, the availability of gloves which are supposedly AV may give rise to an ethical dilemma: the user may handle the machines more intensely and for a longer time in the belief that the hand is protected from vibration damage. But are those AV claims true and how do these gloves perform in practice? Is the experience regarding the gloves that they dampen the vibrations? To what extent do the gloves disturb the worker and interfere with the work? How much damping can be expected when using low-speed and high-speed grinders, respectively? These issues will be discussed in the following report. ImplementationNine subjects, whose work task was to deburr and grind aircraft engine components, were given the opportunity to test a specific AVG for 3 months. They all worked with a variety of rotating air-powered and vibrating machines. All had extensive experience in this work. Usage times for the individual machines varied between ½ hour and 4 hours/day. The total usage times sometimes exceeded 4 hours/day. The most commonly used rotating machines rotate at high speeds, 100 000 revolutions per minute (rpm), but other machines with low speed, 500 rpm, were also used. Only one model of AVG was tested. The back of the glove was made of porous polyester and the palm of a denser, elastic synthetic material. Approximately 7 mm thick, foam-like materials were built into the palm, thumb and fingers grip side of the glove. The glove was CE-marked and was claimed to comply with standard ISO 10819 : 1996. The test subjects tried the glove for 3 months. After this period they answered a questionnaire containing 14 questions including questions on hand temperature, grip, dexterity and self-reported vibration damping. To assess the usefulness of the AVG, the vibration level and vibration frequency spectrum were measured on the machines used by the subjects. During the measurements a skilled operator performed a typical deburring task. Results and DiscussionThe comfort in terms of hand temperature was rated mediocre. Grip was rated good while finger sensitivity was rated low. At a so-called “pencil grip”, required for handling small machinery, the gloves were uncomfortable; however, they worked well with larger machines. The majority, eight of the nine individuals, responded that the glove offered good vibration damping. As the hand’s ability to perceive vibrations varies with the frequency of vibration the possibility to self-assess whether a glove is vibration-damping or not largely depends on how well the person can perceive the frequency of the machine in question. With a high-revving machine of, say, 50 000 rpm, the vibration tactility is fairly low, and so is therefore the ability to self-assess the glove’s damping properties. In addition, the <b>vibratory</b> <b>sense</b> in the hand does not reflect the hand-arm weighted vibration level which needs to be measured according to the Swedish Work Environment Authority’s regulations (AFS 2005 : 15). With regard to the vibrations, large differences between the various machines were measured; hand-arm weighted levels according to the regulations were between 0. 8 and 8. 3 m/s 2. High-revving, ≥ 55 000 rpm, machines gave the lowest weighted vibration levels. A machine’s rotation speed was found to cause the dominant vibration frequency; however, high frequencies from high-speed machines do not increase the hand-arm weighted exposure levels. ConclusionThe vibrations from many of the machines in this study, which are used over long periods for deburring, will be damped to some extent. But it is not obvious that this damping neither can be experienced, nor give reduced daily vibration exposure in accordance with the regulations, or reduce the risk of vibration injury in the hands. So-called “AVGs” generally give insufficient reduction in vibration exposure. This is demonstrated already by the standard for CE certification of AVGs. For a glove to protect against normal, low-frequency vibrations, it would have to be too heavy and thick to be practical. Despite the limitations of the protection that the CE-marked protective gloves offer against vibrations, we still recommend the use of gloves because: 1) High-frequency vibrations, which are presumed to be harmful, will be damped. 2) The gloves will ensure that vibrations will not be amplified. 3) Gloves keep the hands warm, which is believed to reduce vibration-related disorders...|$|E
