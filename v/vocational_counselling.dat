Researchers manifest in their turn, a growing interest to study the role of <b>vocational</b> <b>counselling,</b> from the perspective of increasing the efficiency of investment in education and strengthening the capacity of enterprises {{to meet the challenges of}} the knowledge economy. In Romania, high school students have access to career guidance services, but there is little information on the extent to which they use or how useful they consider these services. Many times, there is a social conformism among high school graduates, which determines them to choose professions valued at a certain moment, without making a personal judgment. The aim of this paper is to analyse, as a good practice, the role of high school graduate <b>vocational</b> <b>counselling</b> in developing professional skills, in order to help them make the right career decision. In order to monitor the high school students` opinions on the vocational guidance and their perceptions of the integration in the labour market, a market research study has been conducted. This is a survey conducted on a sample of 2, 364 high school students in their final year of study (twelve grade).

Each subject completed {{a version of the}} Repertory Grid consisting of 22 Role Titles and 22 supplied constructs. Grid responses were averaged and examined for the group as a whole as well as for sub-groups consisting of male and female, private and state school pupils, separately. The pattern of relationships existing between all 22 Role Figures was determined by subjecting the data to both a multidimensional scaling and an hierarchical clustering form of analysis. Clusters of figures produced by these methods were examined and discussed in terms of their composition and the descriptive adjectives and phrases associated with them. As predicted, {{it was found that the}} subjects made their discriminations between people on two major construct dimensions, an intimacy and a potency factor and that the <b>vocational</b> <b>counselling</b> persons appeared in two of the generalized figure clusters indicating that there are at least two distinct parts to the <b>vocational</b> <b>counselling</b> role.

Hence, it is straightforward that the increase of entrepreneurship courses is expected to lead to {{an increase in the number}} of start-ups.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the case for}} personnel systems based on maximizing the differential information gathered about individual abilities and their match to jobs.

Recent differential approaches use computer simulation modelling of alternative hypothetical systems to evaluate potential efficiency. The paper reviews the theoretical background on the structure of human abilities which has led to these contrasting approaches to personnel system design, and presents evidence, based on the US Army selection and classification system, in support of the alternative approach. Individual test/aptitude profiles improve the efficiency of personnel selection and classification as well as academic, <b>vocational</b> and career <b>counselling.</b> They also provide a broader, potentially fairer definition of talent than a unidimensional indicator of cognitive ability, and a foundation for the design of learning and decision environments around learner and user profiles...|$|R

40|$|Interests {{have been}} a central focus of <b>counselling</b> {{psychology}} (and <b>vocational</b> psychology in particular) for over 100 years.

30|$|In {{order to}} examine {{the content of the}} abstracts, we analyse words of articles’ titles (3 b) and abstracts (3 d). Education and {{learning}} appear less frequent words in these corpuses (Table  1). In the titles’ corpus (3 b), “entrepreneurship” and “entrepreneurial” dominate, while word associations are similar to the author keywords (3 c). “Entrepreneurial” mostly refers to the orientation and performance of SMEs, while “entrepreneurship” exhibits three certain branches, one of them been “education”. Education further refers to university, science, technology and students’ intentions (hypothesis H 2 b is supported). Notably, “learning” is mostly thought as “organisational” (hypothesis H 3 b is supported). This result could due to the large number of articles examining the entrepreneurial process based on the firm as the level of analysis. The latter finding is strengthened in abstracts’ pattern (3 d) where the word “firm” creates a cluster that includes “innovation”, “industry” and “management” concepts. In the same word map, the economic growth and regional development cluster is distinctive, while “education” forms a cluster that includes “university”, “students”, their “skills” and “intentions” along with “learning” (hypothesis H 2 b supported, hypothesis H 1 partially supported). The emergent pattern can be understood bearing in mind that fostering entrepreneurial mindsets has been an educational priority after 00 s in most countries. Thus, there is significant production of entrepreneurship education research which needs to be further discussed towards its content and impact. In addition, “labour” and “employment” appear connected in plot (3 d) probably due to the studies of labour economists. “Culture” also appears in abstracts as it is usually discussed in entrepreneurial studies. However, these words do not appear associated with education which implies that there is attention on employment or self-employment rates and cultural issues but not as an outcome of entrepreneurial courses. Career guidance and lifelong learning, as means of bridging education with employment, are absent in the frequency analysis of the literature examined here. Hence, partial support of hypothesis H 1 concerns students’ intentions solely, without a rigorous connection with <b>vocational</b> training, career <b>counselling</b> and lifelong learning.|$|R
