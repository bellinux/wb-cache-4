50|$|Automobiles Ford S.A. Française's {{operations}} became uneconomic {{with the}} sudden erection of tariff barriers in 1932 against imported components, mainly from Britain. Ford and Mathis entered protracted and uncomfortable negotiations. In 1934 {{a joint venture}} of Ford and Mathis emerged (Matford SA Française, Strasbourg). Matford, which copied the style of contemporary British Ford models, soon {{became one of the}} biggest competitors - the original Mathis factory closed down in 1935. The last models featured a <b>V-shaped</b> <b>windscreen.</b> Matford ceased production in 1939.|$|E
5000|$|Its [...] five {{cylinder}} Hispano-Suiza 5Q {{radial engine}} (a licence-built Wright R-540) was {{mounted in the}} nose within a narrow-chord cowling. Behind it the fuselage was flat-sided, constructed from panels linked by frames which left the interior free of cross-bracing. The well-appointed cabin was 3.16 m long with two seats in tandem, fitted with dual controls, and a luggage space behind. The forward seat was behind a two piece, <b>V-shaped</b> <b>windscreen</b> and on each side there {{was a pair of}} windows; on the port side the largest of these was in the large, trapezoidal door.|$|E
50|$|Eight Mosquitos were {{primarily}} used, five airworthy {{and others that}} could be taxied on runways or used as set dressing. The airworthy TT 35 Mosquitos were converted to resemble a fighter-bomber variant (FB Mk VI). The TT 35 models had their clear nosecones and side windows painted over and dummy machine gun barrels fitted. One airworthy Mosquito was a T3 with a solid nose, which only required the fitting of dummy gun barrels. It lacked the two-stage Merlin engines, <b>V-shaped</b> <b>windscreen</b> and bulged bomb bay of the TT 35s. At least one surplus Mosquito was destroyed in a simulated crash scene.|$|E
50|$|Up to {{that time}} Austin and others {{supplied}} only a hire car chassis intended to accept specialist bodies and their hire car chassis didn't comply with the London taxicab regulations. Austin's exhibit at this 1929 show was their new chassis on which they had amended their Heavy Twelve chassis's steering to provide a tighter turning circle and switched their cable-operated for rod-operated brakes {{to comply with the}} regulations. After that Mann & Overton's designer and coachbuilders had only to replace Austin's usual <b>V-shaped</b> <b>windscreen</b> with a flat upright screen and amend the offside front door opening of a hire car to make a luggage platform.Most buyers chose landaulette bodywork because the very back section of the roof could be lowered in summer.The first new generation Mann & Overton Austin entered service in April-May 1930.|$|E
5000|$|In 1935 a {{range of}} V-8 engined Matfords {{was put on the}} market which were very similar to the American Ford Model 48s with their V-8 3622cc engines. A French version {{appeared}} in 1936 as the model that {{has come to be known}} as the Matford Alsace, with a choice of a 2,225 or 3,621 cc V-8 engine: a cabriolet was also listed. The 1937 models were generally known at the time simply as the Matford 13CV and the Matford 21CV which followed the convention of the time by using the cars' fiscal horse power ratings as model names. [...] Both featured a <b>V-shaped</b> <b>windscreen</b> and in 1938 a US style timber bodied estate car joined the range. The steel car bodies were purchased from the coachbuilders Chausson rather than being built inhouse.|$|E
5000|$|The 1920 {{catalogue}} {{included a}} Vauxhall Velox featherweight coupé to seat {{two in the}} interior and with chauffeur's dicky seat, electric lamp in roof and <b>V-shaped</b> <b>windscreen.</b> Though of extremely light construction the wood frame on which the metal panels are laid are contrived to give sufficient strength. The featherweight Velox coupé displayed at the (Scottish) Motor Show painted dark blue below [...] "water line" [...] and black above had nickel fittings and a polished aluminium bonnet and a walnut instrument panel with companion lockers. The coupé was upholstered in blue morocco leather with head lining, carpet, silk cords and laces to match. There were also blinds of a lighter blue silk with tassels. These were special body fittings for the cars in the show and not provided within the advertised price.|$|E
