5|$|Cicero {{stated the}} twins {{objection}} (that with close birth times, personal outcomes {{can be very}} different), later developed by Saint Augustine. He argued that since the other planets are much more distant from the earth than the moon, they could have only <b>very</b> <b>tiny</b> influence compared to the moon's. He also argued that if astrology explains everything about a person's fate, then it wrongly ignores the visible effect of inherited ability and parenting, changes in health worked by medicine, or {{the effects of the}} weather on people.|$|E
5|$|In the Geiger–Marsden experiment, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden (colleagues of Rutherford {{working at}} his behest) shot alpha {{particles}} at thin sheets {{of metal and}} measured their deflection {{through the use of}} a fluorescent screen. Given the very small mass of the electrons, the high momentum of the alpha particles, and the low concentration of the positive charge of the plum pudding model, the experimenters expected all the alpha particles to pass through the metal foil without significant deflection. To their astonishment, a small fraction of the alpha particles experienced heavy deflection. Rutherford concluded that the positive charge of the atom must be concentrated in a <b>very</b> <b>tiny</b> volume to produce an electric field sufficiently intense to deflect the alpha particles so strongly.|$|E
25|$|Rutherford thus {{rejected}} Thomson's {{model of}} the atom, and instead proposed a model where the atom consisted of mostly empty space, with all its positive charge concentrated in its center in a <b>very</b> <b>tiny</b> volume, surrounded by a cloud of electrons.|$|E

40|$|Presented at the Einstein Symposium, Bibliotheca Alexandrina, June 4, 2005 Unprecedented {{international}} efforts have resulted into amazing insights {{in the world}} of subatomic particles and the forces that control their dynamical behavior. This required large and delicate constructions to obtain experimental information, as well as advanced and ingenious mathematical methods to formulate our theories. Yet there is still a vast unknown territory. We {{do not know how to}} describe the way matter interacts with gravity at the <b>very</b> <b>tiniest</b> distance scales. At present we can only speculate about nature’s deepest secrets...|$|R
25|$|Since {{mutation}} rate is relatively constant, roughly {{one half of}} these changes occurred in the human lineage. Only a <b>very</b> <b>tiny</b> fraction of those fixed differences {{gave rise to the}} different phenotypes of humans and chimpanzees and finding those is a great challenge. The vast majority of the differences are neutral and do not affect the phenotype.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} mouth alcohol being {{analyzed}} by the breath analyzer {{is that it}} was not absorbed through the stomach and intestines and passed through the blood to the lungs. In other words, the machine's computer is mistakenly applying the partition ratio (see above) and multiplying the result. Consequently, a <b>very</b> <b>tiny</b> amount of alcohol from the mouth, throat or stomach can {{have a significant impact on}} the breath-alcohol reading.|$|E
25|$|Fairies are {{generally}} described as human in appearance and having magical powers. Diminutive fairies {{of one kind}} or another have been recorded for centuries, but occur alongside the human-sized beings; these have been depicted as ranging in size from <b>very</b> <b>tiny</b> up to the size of a human child. Even with these small fairies, however, their small size may be magically assumed rather than constant. Some fairies though normally quite small were able to dilate their figures to imitate humans. On Orkney they were described as short in stature, dressed in dark grey, and sometimes seen in armour.|$|E

25|$|EMEA: European, Middle Eastern and African {{issuances}} {{are trading}} usually out of Europe, London being the biggest node followed by Paris {{and to a}} lesser extent Frankfurt and Geneva. It represents about 25% of the global market and shows a greater diversity in terms of structures (e.g. from CoCoCo's to French OCEANE). Because of that lack of standardisation, it is often considered to be more technical and unforgiving than the American market from a trading perspective. A <b>very</b> <b>tiny</b> amount of the volumes is traded on exchange while the vast majority is done OTC without a price reporting system (e.g. like TRACE). Liquidity is significantly lower than on the Northern American market.

25|$|Now, imagine {{starting}} at the bottom left corner of the phase diagram, in the vacuum where μ=T=0. If we heat up the system without introducing any preference for quarks over antiquarks, this corresponds to moving vertically upwards along the T axis. At first, quarks are still confined and we create a gas of hadrons (pions, mostly). Then around T=150MeV there is a crossover to the quark gluon plasma: thermal fluctuations break up the pions, and we find a gas of quarks, antiquarks, and gluons, as well as lighter particles such as photons, electrons, positrons, etc. Following this path corresponds to travelling far back in time (so to say), {{to the state of}} the universe shortly after the big bang (where there was a <b>very</b> <b>tiny</b> preference for quarks over antiquarks).|$|E
25|$|In 1903, Svante Arrhenius {{published}} {{in his article}} The Distribution of Life in Space, the hypothesis now called radiopanspermia, that microscopic forms of life can be propagated in space, driven by the radiation pressure from stars. Arrhenius argued that particles at a critical size below 1.5 μm would be propagated at high speed by radiation pressure of the Sun. However, because its effectiveness decreases with increasing size of the particle, this mechanism holds for <b>very</b> <b>tiny</b> particles only, such as single bacterial spores. The main criticism of radiopanspermia hypothesis came from Shklovskii and Sagan, who pointed out the proofs of the lethal action of space radiations (UV and X-rays) in the cosmos. Regardless of the evidence, Wallis and Wickramasinghe argued in 2004 that the transport of individual bacteria or clumps of bacteria, is overwhelmingly more important than lithopanspermia in terms of numbers of microbes transferred, even accounting for the death rate of unprotected bacteria in transit.|$|E
50|$|The <b>very</b> <b>tiniest</b> of the Dog {{family is}} the Mexican Lapdog, a {{creature}} so very minute in its dimensions as to appear almost fabulous {{to those who have}} not seen this animal itself. One of these little canine pets is to be seen in the British Museum, and always attracts much attention from the visitors. Indeed, if it were not in so dignified a locality, it would be generally classed with the mermaid, the flying serpent, and the Tartar lamb, as an admirable example of clever workmanship. It is precisely like those white woollen toy Dogs which sit upon a pair of bellows, and when pressed give forth a nondescript sound, intended to do duty for the legitimate canine bark. To say that it is no larger than these toys would be hardly true, for I have seen in the shop windows many a toy Dog which exceeded in size the veritable Mexican Lapdog.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, before {{enzymology}} was well understood, colloids {{were thought to}} be the key to the operation of enzymes; i.e., the addition of small quantities of an enzyme to a quantity of water would, in some fashion yet to be specified, subtly alter the properties of the water so that it would break down the enzyme's specific substrate, such as a solution of ATPase breaking down ATP. Furthermore, life itself was explainable in terms of the aggregate properties of all the colloidal substances that make up an organism. As more detailed knowledge of biology and biochemistry developed, the colloidal theory was replaced by the macromolecular theory, which explains enzymes as a collection of identical huge molecules that act as <b>very</b> <b>tiny</b> machines, freely moving about between the water molecules of the solution and individually operating on the substrate, no more mysterious than a factory full of machinery. The properties of the water in the solution are not altered, other than the simple osmotic changes that would be caused by the presence of any solute. In humans, both the thyroid gland and the intermediate lobe (pars intermedia) of the pituitary gland contain colloid follicles.|$|E

500|$|In Homogenic, every {{track was}} {{built around a}} loud beat, but in Vespertine Björk {{wanted to make a}} [...] "microcosmos of thirty or forty beats interacting". To do this, she {{recorded}} noises around her house to make beats out of them.

They added beats made from the noise of crushing ice and shuffling cards, among others. In her documentary [...] Minuscule, Björk explained that this process consisted of [...] "taking something <b>very</b> <b>tiny</b> and magnifying it up to big", intending to convey the [...] "sensation that you've been told a secret", that is also present in micrographs.|$|E
500|$|On May 2, 2008, a {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) scan showed that he had <b>very</b> <b>tiny</b> ( [...] or less) metastases in his lungs and {{in some of the}} lymph nodes in his chest.

On June 26, 2008, Pausch indicated that he was considering stopping further chemotherapy because of the potential adverse side effects. He was, however, considering some immuno-therapy-based approaches. On July 24, on behalf of Pausch, a friend anonymously posted a message on Pausch's webpage stating that a biopsy had indicated that the cancer had progressed farther than had been indicated by recent PET scans and that Pausch had [...] "taken a step down" [...] and was [...] "much sicker than he had been". The friend also stated that Pausch had then enrolled in a hospice program designed to provide palliative care to those at the end of life.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Disturbia" [...] begins in a surrealistic, circus-like torture chamber where Rihanna is seen dressed in black, wearing dark make-up and having long black nails while she presses the keys {{of a big}} dark piano and looks into the camera.

Rihanna stays in the prison with two men watching on her from the both sides. Other scenes include Rihanna sitting on a throne chair and singing the song, while two strange women (one is played by American drag queen Detox Icunt) are around her. Then, multiple people around her are holding her in front of a gas chamber. As the chorus starts Rihanna is seen tied up in a bed from which she can't get out. At the bridge of the song Rihanna and her dancers are performing a Thriller-esque dance routine. As the second verse starts, Rihanna is seen holding a column and fire is around her. As the song continues, Rihanna drags a man doll around a metal web. In the second chorus she wears a metal spines corset while one tarantula is upon her arm. In the later scene, Rihanna is in a <b>very</b> <b>tiny</b> room, with her hands and legs been tied up. The video ends with Rihanna turning around on her chair.|$|E
