25|$|In the 1950s, fuses in new {{residential}} or industrial construction for {{branch circuit}} protection were superseded by low <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers.|$|E
25|$|The {{circuit breaker}} must firstly detect a fault condition. In small mains and low <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers, {{this is usually}} done within the device itself. Typically, the heating and/or {{magnetic}} effects of electric current are employed. Circuit breakers for large currents or high voltages are usually arranged with protective relay pilot devices to sense a fault condition and to operate the opening mechanism. These typically require a separate power source, such as a battery, although some high-voltage circuit breakers are self-contained with current transformers, protective relays, and an internal control power source.|$|E
25|$|Medium-voltage circuit {{breakers}} rated between 1 and 72 kV may be assembled into metal-enclosed switchgear line ups for indoor use, {{or may be}} individual components installed outdoors in a substation. Air-break {{circuit breakers}} replaced oil-filled units for indoor applications, but are now themselves being replaced by vacuum circuit breakers (up to about 40.5 kV). Like the high <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers described below, these are also operated by current sensing protective relays operated through current transformers. The characteristics of MV breakers are given by international standards such as IEC 62271. Medium-voltage circuit breakers nearly always use separate current sensors and protective relays, instead of relying on built-in thermal or magnetic overcurrent sensors.|$|E

2500|$|Line voltage {{thermostats}} {{are most}} commonly used for electric space heaters such as a baseboard heater or a direct-wired electric furnace. [...] If a line voltage thermostat is used, system power (in the United States, 120 or 240 volts) is directly switched by the thermostat. With switching current often exceeding 40 amperes, using a low voltage thermostat on a line <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit</b> will result {{at least in the}} failure of the thermostat and possibly a fire. [...] Line voltage thermostats are sometimes used in other applications, such as the control of fan-coil (fan powered from line voltage blowing through a coil of tubing which is either heated or cooled by a larger system) [...] units in large systems using centralized boilers and chillers, or to control circulation pumps in hydronic heating applications.|$|E

50|$|Protective {{equipment}} on high-voltage transmission lines normally prevents {{formation of an}} unwanted arc, or ensures that it is quenched within tens of milliseconds. Electrical apparatus that interrupts high-voltage circuits is designed to safely direct the resulting arc so that it dissipates without damage. High <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers often use a blast of high pressure air, a special dielectric gas (such as SF6 under pressure), or immersion in mineral oil to quench the arc when the high <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit</b> is broken.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{smart power}} IC technology, {{low and high}} <b>voltage</b> <b>circuits</b> are {{integrated}} on the same substrate. The commutation of the high <b>voltage</b> <b>circuits</b> can induce substrate parasitic currents which can severely disturb {{the operation of the}} low <b>voltage</b> <b>circuits.</b> The parasitic currents due to minority carriers in the high voltage technology can be significantly high. However, the minority carrier propagation into the substrate is not considered in most of existing circuit simulators. In this paper, a novel computer-aided design tool for substrate parasitic extraction is proposed. A simple circuit with an injecting and a collecting N-wells over a P-substrate is studied. With the distance between the wells varying, the lateral bipolar effect is illustrated. The spectre simulation results of extracted substrate equivalent circuit are compared to a TCAD simulation results. The comparison shows an acceptable relevant error. However, the simulation time was reduced by approximately 1400 times with respect to the TCAD...|$|R

50|$|The {{potential}} difference {{mentioned in the}} batteries and cells is usually the open <b>circuit</b> <b>voltage.</b> Open <b>circuit</b> <b>voltage</b> {{is known as the}} electromotive force (emf), which is the maximum {{potential difference}} when there is no current and the circuit is not closed.|$|R
50|$|De-energized {{power lines}} can be {{hazardous}} {{as they can}} still be energized from another source such as interconnection or interaction with another circuit even when they appear shut off. For example: A higher-voltage distribution level circuit may feed several lower-voltage distribution circuits through transformers. If the higher <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit</b> is de-energized, but if lower-voltage circuits connected remain energized, the higher <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit</b> will remain energized. Another problem can arise when de-energized wires become energized through electrostatic or electromagnetic induction from energized wires in close proximity.|$|E

50|$|Relays {{are used}} {{wherever}} {{it is necessary to}} control a high power or high <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit</b> with a low power circuit, especially when galvanic isolation is desirable. The first application of relays was in long telegraph lines, where the weak signal received at an intermediate station could control a contact, regenerating the signal for further transmission. High-voltage or high-current devices can be controlled with small, low voltage wiring and pilots switches. Operators can be isolated from the high <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit.</b> Low power devices such as microprocessors can drive relays to control electrical loads beyond their direct drive capability. In an automobile, a starter relay allows the high current of the cranking motor to be controlled with small wiring and contacts in the ignition key.|$|E
25|$|Medium-voltage fuses {{rated for}} a few {{thousand}} volts are never used on low <b>voltage</b> <b>circuits,</b> because of their cost and because they cannot properly clear the circuit when operating at very low voltages.|$|R

TDC-250000/220 transformers connect two turbo-generators (TGV-200-2MUZ (Block No. 1) and TGV-200M (Blocks No. 2, 3, 4)) of 15.75 kV of voltage to 220 kV <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit.</b> The overall capacity is 810 MW.|$|E
50|$|Other {{standard}} {{features include}} automatic reclosing circuit breakers (reclosers). Most faults (overcurrent) are transient. Since {{the network is}} rural, most of these faults will be cleared by the recloser. Each service site needs a rewirable drop out fuse for protection and switching of the transformer. The transformer secondary should also be protected by a standard high-rupture capacity (HRC) fuse or low <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker. A surge arrestor (spark gap) on the high voltage side is common, especially in lightning-prone areas.|$|E
50|$|RS-422 {{specifies}} {{the electrical}} {{characteristics of a}} single balanced signal. The standard was written to be referenced by other standards that specify the complete DTE/DCE interface for applications which require a balanced <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit</b> to transmit data. These other standards would define protocols, connectors, pin assignments and functions. Standards such as EIA-530 (DB-25 connector) and EIA-449 (DC-37 connector) use RS-422 electrical signals. Some RS-422 devices have 4 screw terminals for pairs of wire, with one pair used for data in each direction.|$|E

50|$|Around the 1970s {{the primary}} breaker points were largely {{replaced}} with a Hall effect sensor or optical sensor. As this is a non-contacting device and the ignition coil is controlled by solid state electronics, {{a great amount of}} maintenance in point adjustment and replacement was eliminated. This also eliminates any problem with breaker follower or cam wear, and by eliminating a side load it extends distributor shaft bearing life. The remaining secondary (high <b>voltage)</b> <b>circuit</b> stayed essentially the same, using an ignition coil and a rotary distributor.|$|E

50|$|Before World War II Latécoère was a {{prolific}} aircraft manufacturer, particularly known for large flying boats. Post-war they produced many projects but no new designs were built and flown for almost 40 years. By the mid-1950s they had diversified, {{with a wide}} range of technical products, many with their own Latécoère type number. Some of these numbers duplicated those of earlier aircraft, for example the Latécoère 300 was an early 1930s flying boat but a 1960s high <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker. Just one of their diversifications produced an aircraft; the Latécoère 225 ultralight shares its number with a post-war four engine bomber project.|$|E

50|$|Some high <b>voltage</b> <b>{{circuits}}</b> {{are often}} erected {{on the same}} tower as 110 kV lines. Paralleling circuits of 380 kV, 220 kV and 110 kV-lines on the same towers is common.

50|$|During {{the initial}} {{activation}} of the X-SAR, controllers reported {{they were unable to}} fully power up the amplifier that provides power to the radar. The problem was in the low <b>voltage</b> <b>circuit</b> internal to the power amplifier. Engineers were not immediately able to explain the problem, so they turned off the power amplifier for about three hours. The problem was traced to an oversensitive protection circuit, a type of circuit breaker. The radar lab engineers bypassed the protection circuit and turned on the instrument at about 4:20 pm Saturday. It worked without incident, completing 100 percent of its scheduled observations overnight.|$|E
