However iOS does not currently support file transfer via Bluetooth. iPad also features 1024×768 VGA <b>video</b> <b>output</b> for limited applications, screen capture, connecting an external display or television through an accessory adapter.|$|E
5|$|MHL pares {{down the}} three TMDS {{channels}} {{in a standard}} HDMI connection to a single one running over any connector that provides at least five pins. This allows existing connectors that are already found in mobile devices – such as micro-USB – to be utilized, avoiding the need to add additional dedicated <b>video</b> <b>output</b> sockets. The USB port switches to MHL mode when it detects a compatible device is connected.|$|E
5|$|Xbox One {{supports}} 4K resolution <b>video</b> <b>output</b> and 7.1 surround sound. Yusuf Mehdi, corporate {{vice president}} of marketing and strategy for Microsoft, has stated that there is no hardware restriction that would prevent games from running at 4K resolution. Unlike the Xbox 360, the Xbox One does not support 1080i and other interlaced resolutions. Xbox One supports HDMI 1.4 for both input and output, and does not support composite or component video.|$|E
50|$|The BDP-S1's analog and {{component}} <b>video</b> <b>outputs</b> differentiate it {{from most}} Blu-ray Disc players {{manufactured in the}} 2010s, as all Blu-ray Disc players manufactured after 2013 no longer come equipped with analog or component <b>video</b> <b>outputs</b> in order to deter video piracy.|$|R

50|$|The DG4-2 Display Generator board {{contains}} {{hardware to}} drive up to two <b>video</b> <b>outputs,</b> which may be expanded to eight <b>video</b> <b>outputs</b> with an optional daughterboard, a configuration known as the DG4-8. The outputs are independent and each output has hardware for generating video timing, video resizing, gamma correction, genlock and digital-to-analog conversion. Digital-to-analog conversion is provided by 8-bit digital-to-analog converters that support a pixel clock frequency up to 220 MHz.|$|R
5|$|Both the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 support 1080p high {{definition}} <b>video</b> <b>output.</b> However, the output signal may {{be protected by}} digital rights management and may require an HDCP-compliant display if HDMI is used. The Xbox Live Marketplace service and the PlayStation Store offer HD movies, TV shows, movie trailers, and clips for download to the console's HDD. Other regional PlayStation Stores only allow download of movie trailers and short segment clips. As of November 2009, the Video Download service present on the American PlayStation Store {{will be available for}} select European countries.|$|E
5|$|<b>Video</b> <b>output</b> {{is through}} an RF {{modulator}} and {{was designed for}} use with contemporary television sets, for a simple colour graphic display. Text can be displayed using 32columns × 24rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set or from a set provided within an application, from a palette of 15 shades: seven colours at two levels of brightness each, plus black. The image resolution is 256×192 with the same colour limitations. To conserve memory, colour is stored separate from the pixel bitmap in a low resolution, 32×24 grid overlay, corresponding to the character cells. In practice, this means that all pixels of an 8x8 character block share one foreground colour and one background colour.|$|E
5|$|PCs with a DVI {{interface}} {{are capable}} of <b>video</b> <b>output</b> to an HDMI-enabled monitor. Some PCs include an HDMI interface and may also be capable of HDMI audio output, depending on specific hardware. For example, Intel's motherboard chipsets since the 945G and NVIDIA’s GeForce 8200/8300 motherboard chipsets {{are capable of}} 8-channel LPCM output over HDMI. Eight-channel LPCM audio output over HDMI with a video card was first seen with the ATI Radeon HD 4850, which was released in June 2008 and is implemented by other video cards in the ATI Radeon HD 4000 series. Linux can drive 8-channel LPCM audio over HDMI if the video card has the necessary hardware and implements the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). The ATI Radeon HD 4000 series implements ALSA. Cyberlink announced in June 2008 that they would update their PowerDVD playback software to allow 192kHz/24-bit Blu-ray Disc audio decoding in Q3-Q4 of 2008. Corel's WinDVD 9 Plus currently has 96kHz/24-bit Blu-ray Disc audio decoding.|$|E
40|$|A circuit for {{scanning}} and outputting the induced {{charges in}} a solid state {{charge coupled device}} (CCD) image detector is disclosed in an image detection system {{for use in a}} spacecraft attitude control system. The image detection system includes timing control circuitry for selectively controlling the output of the CCD detector so that <b>video</b> <b>outputs</b> are provided only with respect to induced charges corresponding to predetermined sensing element lines of the CCD detector. The timing control circuit and the analog to digital converter are controlled by a programmed microprocessor which defines the <b>video</b> <b>outputs</b> to be converted and further controls the timing control circuit so that no <b>video</b> <b>outputs</b> are provided during the delay associated with analog to digital conversion...|$|R
50|$|Certain output {{features}} were prohibited from coupon-eligible devices: component video, VGA, RGB, DVI, HDMI, USB video, IEEE-1394/iLink/Firewire video, Ethernet video, and IEEE-802.11/WiFi <b>video</b> <b>outputs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{screen is}} a high-glossy display and {{measures}} 17.3 inches diagonally, {{and has a}} resolution of 1600x900 pixels. HDMI and VGA <b>video</b> <b>outputs</b> also are available.|$|R

25|$|The Mac Mini can be {{used for}} home cinema (theater) applications. The small footprint, multi-format <b>video</b> <b>output,</b> digital audio output, remote control IR {{receiver}} and the relatively powerful Intel CPUs make it easy to use the Mac Mini as part of a home entertainment system.|$|E
25|$|The ZEN Vision has a 3.7-inch, trans-reflective VGA TFT-LCD screen. It has a <b>video</b> <b>output</b> (PAL or NTSC) {{port and}} a CompactFlash slot {{which can be}} used to {{transfer}} the contents to the player. An adapter for other memory card types is also available as an accessory. The ZEN Vision also supports an optional infrared remote.|$|E

50|$|The DL-3x00 {{series was}} first {{demonstrated}} at IDF in September 2011. It supports dual <b>video</b> <b>outputs</b> (DL-3900 and DL-3950) and integrated 5.1 audio and Gigabit Ethernet. It also integrated a new compression scheme, called DL3.0 and content protection using HDCP 2.0 encryption.|$|R
50|$|Lastly, {{like many}} modern {{consoles}} {{and other devices}} meant {{to be connected to}} a TV, many modern famiclones lack an RF modulator and instead only have separate audio and composite <b>video</b> <b>outputs</b> (sometimes S-Video), also to cut on the (already low) production costs.|$|R
25|$|The {{system allows}} for <b>video</b> <b>output</b> in two formats: {{composite}} video and S-Video. The composite and S-Video cables {{are the same}} as those used with the earlier SNES and later GameCube systems. However, it does not support RGB or Component natively that the Super Nintendo and other competing consoles benefited from at the time.|$|E
25|$|The Atari 2600 is {{generally}} considered to be a very demanding programming environment, with a mere 128 bytes of RAM available without additional hardware, and no video frame buffer at all. The programmer must prepare each line of <b>video</b> <b>output</b> one at a time as it is being sent to the television. The only sprite capabilities the 2600 offers are one-dimensional 1-bit and 8-bit patterns; creating a two-dimensional object requires changing the pattern between each line of video.|$|E
25|$|The Iomega TV with Boxee is a Linux device {{which comes}} pre-installed with Boxee media center software. The {{hardware}} {{is based on}} Intel CE4110 system-on-a-chip platform (that has a 1.2Ghz Intel Atom CPU with a PowerVR SGX535 Integrated graphics processor), 1GB of RAM, and 1GB of NAND Flash Memory. Iomega TV with Boxee features audio / <b>video</b> <b>output</b> ports for HDMI (version 1.3), optical and coaxial digital audio (S/PDIF) connectors, and RCA connector for analog stereo audio, two USB ports, wired 1Gbps ethernet, and built-in 802.11n WiFi.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of dual video inputs {{is that it}} provides the maximum resolution for each image and the maximum frame rate for each eye. The dis{{advantage of}} dual video inputs is that it requires separate <b>video</b> <b>outputs</b> and cables from the device generating the content.|$|R
50|$|Data for the <b>video</b> <b>outputs</b> are {{provided}} by four ASICs that de-serialize and de-interleave the 160-bit streams into 10-bit component RGBA, 12-bit component RBGA, L16, Stereo Field Sequential (FS) or color indexes. The hardware also incorporates the cursor at this stage. A 32,768 entry color index map is available.|$|R
50|$|In Vista, {{the control}} of PC <b>video</b> <b>outputs</b> is {{provided}} by PVP-OPM, which is essentially {{the next generation of}} Certified Output Protection Protocol (COPP) introduced in Windows XP. However, rather than being a software application programming interface, PVP-OPM operates with the Windows media components in the protected environment.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} PSU {{included on}} early 1982-83 machines had a 5-pin connector and could accidentally be {{plugged into the}} <b>video</b> <b>output.</b> To prevent the user from making this fatal mistake, Commodore changed the plug design on 250407 motherboards to a 3-pin connector. Commodore later changed the design, omitting the gel. The follow-on model, the Commodore 128, used a larger, improved power supply that included a fuse. The power supply {{that came with the}} Commodore REU was {{similar to that of the}} Commodore 128's unit, providing an upgrade for customers who purchased that accessory.|$|E
25|$|The FireStream line is {{a series}} of add-on {{expansion}} cards released from 2006 to 2010, based on standard Radeon GPUs but designed to serve as a general-purpose co-processor, rather than rendering and outputting 3D graphics. Like the FireGL/FirePro line, they were given more memory and memory bandwidth, but the FireStream cards do not necessarily have <b>video</b> <b>output</b> ports. All support 32-bit single-precision floating point, and all but the first release support 64-bit double-precision. The line was partnered with new APIs to provide higher performance than existing OpenGL and Direct3D shader APIs could provide, beginning with Close to Metal, followed by OpenCL and the Stream Computing SDK, and eventually integrated into the APP SDK.|$|E
25|$|QuickTime 3.0 {{added support}} for {{graphics}} importer components that could read images from GIF, JPEG, TIFF and other file formats, and <b>video</b> <b>output</b> components which served primarily to export movie data via FireWire. Apple also licensed several third-party technologies {{for inclusion in}} QuickTime 3.0, including the Sorenson Video codec for advanced video compression, the QDesign Music codec for substantial audio compression, and the complete Roland Sound Canvas instrument set and GS Format extensions for improved playback of MIDI music files. It also added video effects which programmers could apply in real-time to video tracks. Some of these effects would even respond to mouse clicks by the user, {{as part of the}} new movie interaction support (known as wired movies).|$|E
50|$|The DCS Copy Protection {{technology}} {{claims to}} block the copying of analogue <b>video</b> <b>outputs</b> from digital <b>video</b> sources (Digital TV Set Top Boxes, Blu-ray players, etc), modifying the video signal so that DVD recorders, VHS machines etc cannot copy it, while TV sets can display the protected content as normal.|$|R
50|$|For outputs, the YAGH offers 4 BNC {{connector}} terminals for Serial Digital Interface {{use with}} outboard recorders and monitors. In addition, a full-size HDMI port is also present. These <b>video</b> <b>outputs</b> {{differ from the}} camera’s native recording in that they offer a 10-bit 4:2:2 signal rather than the camera’s internal 8-bit 4:2:0.|$|R
50|$|Metacity, an X {{window manager}} uses {{compositing}} in this way. The compositing {{can also make}} use of 3D pipelines accelerations such as GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap. Among other things, this process allows many <b>video</b> <b>outputs</b> to share the same screen without interfering with each other. Other compositing window managers such as Compiz also use compositing.|$|R
25|$|In April, AOL {{took several}} steps {{to expand its}} ability to {{generate}} revenue through online video advertising. The company announced it would offer gross rating point (GRP) guarantee for online video, mirroring the TV ratings system and guaranteeing audience delivery for online video advertising campaigns bought across its properties. This announcement came {{just days before the}} Digital Content NewFront (DCNF) a two-week event held by AOL, Google, Hulu, Microsoft, Vevo and Yahoo to showcase the participating sites' digital video offerings. The Digital Content NewFront were conducted in advance of the traditional television upfronts in hopes of diverting more advertising money into the digital space. On April 24, the company launched the AOL On network, a single website for its <b>video</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
25|$|All models {{feature a}} Broadcom {{system on a chip}} (SoC), which {{includes}} an ARM compatible {{central processing unit}} (CPU) and an on-chip graphics processing unit (GPU, a VideoCore IV). CPU speed ranges from 700MHz to 1.2GHz for the Pi3 and on board memory range from 256MB to 1GB RAM. SecureDigital (SD) cards are used to store the operating system and program memory in either the SDHC or MicroSDHC sizes. Most boards have between one and four USB slots, HDMI and composite <b>video</b> <b>output,</b> and a 3.5mm phono jack for audio. Lower level output is provided by a number of GPIO pins which support common protocols like I²C. The B-models have an 8P8C Ethernet port and the Pi3 and Pi ZeroW have on board Wi-Fi 802.11n and Bluetooth.|$|E
500|$|By 2008, {{two years}} after the Wii's release, Nintendo {{acknowledged}} several limitations and challenges with the system (such as the perception that the system catered primarily to a [...] "casual" [...] audience and was unpopular among [...] "core" [...] gamers). Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto admitted that the lack of support for high definition <b>video</b> <b>output</b> on the Wii and its limited network infrastructure also contributed to the system being regarded separately from its competitors' systems, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.|$|E
50|$|The units had {{to support}} both a 4:3 center crop of a 16:9 {{transmitted}} image, and a letterbox rendition of a 16:9 transmitted image. The <b>video</b> <b>outputs</b> had to produce video at an ITU-R BT.500-11 quality scale of Grade 4 or higher. Various technical performance parameters for the digital tuner were also specified.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} create to S-video output, Nintendo's RP2C02 PPU was {{replaced}} by an RGB-output-compatible [...] "RC2C05-99" [...] PPU. Here, RGB video signals generated within the composite outputs were converted to the external S-video signals. At {{the rear of the}} Titler's body, RCA composite-pin <b>video</b> <b>outputs</b> and mono audio outputs were located, and peripheral devices could connect only when the <b>video</b> and audio <b>outputs</b> to the associated TV also employed RF connectors and S-Video. This allowed gamers to enjoy a crisper image.|$|R
50|$|The box had {{high-end}} hardware, including HDMI, component <b>video</b> <b>outputs,</b> and coaxial (SPDIF) {{and optical}} (TosLink) digital audio outputs. The box also had USB and Ethernet ports, although {{these were not}} activated in the last release of the firmware. An HDMI or DVI connection was required to watch HD content, which was in 720p resolution.|$|R
