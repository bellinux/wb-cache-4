50|$|<b>Vinyon</b> is a {{synthetic}} fiber made from polyvinyl chloride. In some countries {{other than the}} United States, <b>vinyon</b> fibers {{are referred to as}} polyvinyl chloride fibers. It can bind non-woven fibers and fabrics. It was invented in 1939.|$|E
50|$|First U.S. {{commercial}} <b>vinyon</b> fiber production: 1939, FMC Corporation, Fiber Division (formerly American Viscose Corporation).|$|E
50|$|It has {{the same}} health {{problems}} associated with chlorinated polymers. In the past, <b>Vinyon</b> was used a substitute for plant-based filters in tea bags.|$|E
5000|$|The U.S. Federal Trade Commission {{definition}} for <b>vinyon</b> fiber is [...] "A manufactured fiber {{in which the}} fiber-forming substance is any long chain synthetic polymer composed of at least 85 percent by weight of vinyl chloride units ( [...] - CH2 - CHCl - [...] )." ...|$|E
50|$|Dry {{spinning}} is {{also used}} for polymers that must be dissolved in solvent. It differs in that the solidification is achieved through evaporation of the solvent. This is usually achieved by a stream of air or inert gas. Because there is no precipitating liquid involved, the fiber {{does not need to}} be dried, and the solvent is more easily recovered. Acetate, triacetate, acrylic, modacrylic, polybenzimidazole fiber, spandex, and <b>vinyon</b> are produced via this process.|$|E
40|$|The {{search for}} a {{material}} to be utilized as dural substitute has been a continuous one {{for the last six}} decades. Many materials have been tried, including the different metals, various biological tissues, and plant derivatives. Recently, synthetic products have been utilized as dural substitute. Among these, <b>Vinyon</b> "N " (Teng and Feigin, 1955), Teflon (Teng, unpublished data), and Orlon * (Huertas, 1955) have shown the most promising results, producing only minimal tissue reaction when buried intracranially in experimental animals. Since publication of the results obtained in experi-mental monkeys, <b>Vinyon</b> "N " has been used in 40 clinical cases with various neurosurgical conditions, which included its use as (1) dural substitute in repairs of dural defects produced by surgery, trauma, or tumour; (2) bone lining, in the pre-vention of bone reunion in craniostenosis; and (3) nerve wrap after neurolysis in cicatrization (Table I) ...|$|E
