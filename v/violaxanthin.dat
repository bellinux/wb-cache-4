50|$|<b>Violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase is {{an enzyme}} that reduces one epoxide group from <b>violaxanthin</b> into a double bond to create antheraxanthin. It also {{functions}} to create zeaxanthin, where it catalyses {{the reduction of}} two epoxide groups from <b>violaxanthin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase {{is a part}} of the {{xanthophyll}} (or <b>violaxanthin)</b> cycle {{for controlling}} the concentration of zeaxanthin in chloroplasts.|$|E
50|$|The {{xanthophyll}} cycle {{involves the}} enzymatic removal of epoxy groups from xanthophylls (e.g. <b>violaxanthin,</b> antheraxanthin, diadinoxanthin) to create so-called de-epoxidised xanthophylls (e.g. diatoxanthin, zeaxanthin). These enzymatic cycles {{were found to}} {{play a key role}} in stimulating energy dissipation within light-harvesting antenna proteins by non-photochemical quenching- a mechanism to reduce the amount of energy that reaches the photosynthetic reaction centers. Non-photochemical quenching is one of the main ways of protecting against photoinhibition. In higher plants, there are three carotenoid pigments that are active in the xanthophyll cycle: <b>violaxanthin,</b> antheraxanthin, and zeaxanthin. During light stress, <b>violaxanthin</b> is converted to zeaxanthin via the intermediate antheraxanthin, which plays a direct photoprotective role acting as a lipid-protective anti-oxidant and by stimulating non-photochemical quenching within light-harvesting proteins. This conversion of <b>violaxanthin</b> to zeaxanthin is done by the enzyme <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase, while the reverse reaction is performed by zeaxanthin epoxidase.|$|E
50|$|Antheraxanthin is a {{partially}} de-epoxidized (see de-epoxidation) form of <b>violaxanthin.</b> One of violaxanthin’s two epoxide groups {{are removed from}} its chemical structure to generate antheraxanthin. For this reason, the xanthophyll cycle is sometimes called the <b>violaxanthin</b> cycle.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Violaxanthin</b> is a {{carotenoid}} {{downstream from}} chlorophyll a and b within the antenna of PS II and nearest {{to the special}} chlorophyll a located in the reaction center of the antenna. As light intensity increases, acidification of the thylakoid lumen takes place. This acidification leads to the protonation of the PsbS subunit of PS II. Along with the activation of enzyme <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase which eliminates an epoxide and forms an alkene on a six member ring of <b>violaxanthin</b> giving another carotenoid known as antheraxanthin. <b>Violaxanthin</b> contains two epoxides each bonded to a six member ring and when both are eliminated by de-epoxidase the carotenoid zeaxanthin is formed. Only <b>violaxanthin</b> is able to transport a photon to the special chlorophyll a. Antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin dissipate the energy from the photon as heat preserving the integrity of photosystem II. This dissipation of energy as heat is one form of non-photochemical quenching.|$|E

5000|$|Neoxanthin is a {{carotenoid}} and xanthophyll. In plants, it is {{an intermediate}} in the biosynthesis of the plant hormone abscisic acid. It is often present in two forms: all-trans and 9-cis isomers. It is produced from <b>violaxanthin,</b> but a suspected neoxanthin synthase [...] is still to be confirmed. Two different genes were confirmed to be implied in <b>violaxanthin</b> conversion to neoxanthin in Arabidopsis and tomato., It has a specific role in protection against photooxidative stress. It is a major xanthophyll found in green leafy vegetables such as spinach.|$|E
5000|$|... “VAZ” is an {{abbreviation}} of the cycle’s main pigments {{in order}} of lowest to highest photoprotection each pigment provides. Antheraxanthin is denoted by the “A” in the middle, between <b>violaxanthin</b> (V) and zeaxanthin (Z).|$|E
50|$|The {{xanthophyll}} cycle takes place, {{along with}} other photopigment reactions, in the membranes of thylakoids within chloroplasts. Antheraxanthin provides more heat and light stability (via NPQ) to the thylakoid membranes than <b>violaxanthin,</b> but less than zeaxanthin.|$|E
50|$|A {{plant can}} {{increase}} its capacity for non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and excess heat dissipation by converting the orange pigment <b>violaxanthin</b> to antheraxanthin {{and then to}} light-yellow pigment zeaxanthin. The xanthophyll pool, or total xanthophyll cycle pigment levels are sometimes abbreviated as “VAZ” in scientific literature.|$|E
5000|$|Wright et al. (Feb 2011) found that, [...] "The {{increase}} in zeaxanthin appears to surpass {{the decrease in}} <b>violaxanthin</b> in spinach" [...] and commented that the discrepancy {{could be explained by}} [...] "a synthesis of zeaxanthin from beta-carotene", however they noted further study is required to explore this hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|Phaseic acid is {{a product}} of abscisic acid, which is itself the product of the C40 {{carotenoid}} zeaxanthin via at least four enzymatic steps. Zeaxanthin is epoxidized to form <b>violaxanthin</b> or neoxanthin. The C15 end of the molecule is then cleaved by an epoxycarotenoid epoxygenase to form xanthoxin, an aldehyde.|$|E
50|$|Chromoplasts are {{not widely}} studied and are rarely {{the main focus}} of {{scientific}} research. They often play a role in research on the tomato plant (Solanum lycopersicum). Lycopene is responsible for the red color of a ripe fruit in the cultivated tomato, while the yellow color of the flowers is due to xanthophylls <b>violaxanthin</b> and neoxanthin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Violaxanthin</b> is {{a natural}} {{xanthophyll}} pigment with an orange color found {{in a variety of}} plants including pansies. It is biosynthesized from zeaxanthin by epoxidation. [...] As a food additive it is used under the E number E161e as a food coloring; it is not approved for use in the EU or USA however is approved in Australia and New Zealand (where it is listed under its INS number 161e).|$|E
50|$|All eustigmatophytes are unicellular, with coccoid {{cells and}} {{polysaccharide}} cell walls. Eustigmatophytes contain {{one or more}} yellow-green chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll a and the accessory pigments <b>violaxanthin</b> and β-carotene. Eustigmatophyte zoids (gametes) possess a single or pair of flagella, originating from {{the apex of the}} cell. Unlike other heterokontophytes, eustigmatophyte zoids do not have typical photoreceptive organelles (or eyespots); instead an orange-red eyespot outside a chloroplast is located at the anterior end of the zoid.|$|E
50|$|Abscisic acid (ABA) is an isoprenoid plant hormone, {{which is}} {{synthesized}} in the plastidal 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway; unlike the structurally related sesquiterpenes, which are formed from the mevalonic acid-derived precursor farnesyl diphosphate (FDP), the C15 backbone of ABA is formed after cleavage of C40 carotenoids in MEP. Zeaxanthin {{is the first}} committed ABA precursor; a series of enzyme-catalyzed epoxidations and isomerizations via <b>violaxanthin,</b> and final cleavage of the C40 carotenoid by a dioxygenation reaction yields the proximal ABA precursor, xanthoxin, which is then further oxidized to ABA. via abscisic aldehyde.|$|E
5000|$|The tree {{grows to}} 35 m tall, with an upright, {{symmetrical}} crown and horizontal branches. Terminalia catappa has corky, light fruit that are dispersed by water. The seed within the fruit is edible when fully ripe, tasting almost like almond. As the tree gets older, its crown becomes more flattened {{to form a}} spreading, vase shape. Its branches are distinctively arranged in tiers. The leaves are large, [...] long and [...] broad, ovoid, glossy dark green, and leathery. They are dry-season deciduous; before falling, they turn pinkish-reddish or yellow-brown, due to pigments such as <b>violaxanthin,</b> lutein, and zeaxanthin.|$|E
5000|$|Plants, in general, contain six {{ubiquitous}} carotenoids: neoxanthin, <b>violaxanthin,</b> antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin, lutein and β-carotene. Lutein is {{a yellow}} pigment found in {{fruits and vegetables}} and is the most abundant carotenoid in plants. Lycopene is the red pigment responsible for the color of tomatoes. Other less common carotenoids in plants include lutein epoxide (in many woody species), lactucaxanthin (found in lettuce), and alpha carotene (found in carrots). [...] In cyanobacteria, many other carotenoids exist such as canthaxanthin, myxoxanthophyll, synechoxanthin, and echinenone. Algal phototrophs such as dinoflagellates use peridinin as a light harvesting pigment.While carotenoids can be found complexed within chlorophyll-binding proteins such as the photosynthetic reaction centers and light-harvesting complexes, they also are found within dedicated carotenoid proteins such as the orange carotenoid protein of cyanobacteria.|$|E
5000|$|The {{group of}} {{xanthophylls}} includes (among many other compounds) lutein, zeaxanthin, neoxanthin, <b>violaxanthin,</b> flavoxanthin, and α- and β-cryptoxanthin. The latter compound {{is the only}} known xanthophyll to contain a beta-ionone ring, and thus β-cryptoxanthin is the only xanthophyll that is known to possess pro-vitamin A activity for mammals. Even then, it is a vitamin only for plant-eating mammals that possess the enzyme to make retinal from carotenoids that contain beta-ionone (some carnivores lack this enzyme). In species other than mammals, certain xanthophylls may be converted to hydroxylated retinal-analogues that function directly in vision. For example, {{with the exception of}} certain flies, most insects use the xanthophyll derived R-isomer of 3-hydroxyretinal for visual activities, which means that β-cryptoxanthin and other xanthophylls (such as lutein and zeaxanthin) may function as forms of visual [...] "vitamin A" [...] for them, while carotenes (such as beta carotene) do not.|$|E
5000|$|The drop-shaped, {{vegetative}} {{cells of}} G. semen {{are up to}} 100µm long, but can vary quite a bit in form and size, as they are only surrounded by a cell membrane instead of a cell wall. These microalgae are, therefore, highly fragile and sensitive to mechanical stress. The cells are filled with many bright green, oval chloroplasts. The bright green color {{is caused by the}} pigment chlorophyll a. Additionally, G. semen displays the pigments chlorophyll c1 and c2, diadinoxanthin, trans-neoxanthin, cis-neoxanthin, α and β carotene, <b>violaxanthin,</b> zeaxanthin and alloxanthin. Like other heterokont algae, the planktonic cells of G. semen possess two differently shaped flagella, which enable them to actively swim around in the water column. Under physical stress, small organelles that sit under the cell membrane and are called trichocysts, explode and release slimy threads. This likely represents a deterring mechanism against predators. These slimy threads also cause skin irritation for some bathers that are swimming in G. semen blooms.|$|E
50|$|The {{biosynthesis}} for β-damascenone {{begins with}} farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) reacting to produce geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) Figure 1. Next two molecules of GGPP are condensed together to produce phytoene by removal of diphosphate and a proton shift catalyzed by the enzyme phytoene synthase (PSY). Phytoene then {{goes through a}} series of desaturation reactions using the enzyme phytoene desaturase (PDS) to produce phytofluene then ζ-carotene. Other enzymes have been found to catalyze this reaction including CrtI and CrtP.The next series of desaturation reactions is catalyzed by the enzyme ζ-carotene desaturase (ZDS) to produced neurosporene followed by lycopene. Other enzymes that are able to catalyze this reaction include CtrI and CrtQ. Next lycopene goes through two cyclization reactions {{with the use of the}} enzyme lycopene β-cyclase first producing γ-carotene followed by the second cyclization producing β-carotene as shown in Figure 2. The mechanism for the cyclization of lycopene to β-carotene is shown in Scheme 2. Next β-carotene reacts with O2 and the enzyme β-carotene ring hydroxylase producing zeaxanthin.Zeaxanthin then reacts with O2, NADPH (H+), and reduced ferredoxin iron-sulfur cluster in the presence of the enzyme zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZE) to produce antheraxanthin which reacts in a similar fashion to produce <b>violaxanthin.</b> <b>Violaxanthin</b> then reacts with the enzyme neoxanthin synthase to form neoxanthin the main precursor for β-damascenone as shown in Figure 3.In order to generate β-damascenone from neoxanthin there are a few more modifications needed. First neoxanthin undergoes an oxidative cleavage to create the grasshopper ketone. The grasshopper ketone then undergoes a reduction to generate the allenic triol. At this stage there are two main pathways the allenic triol can take to produce the final product. The allenic triol can undergo a dehydration reaction to generate either the acetylenic diol or the allenic diol. Finally one last dehydration reaction of either the acetylenic diol or the allenic diol produces the final product β-damascenone as shown in Figure 4. The proposed mechanism for the conversion of the allenic triol to the acetylenic diol is shown in Scheme 3. The proposed mechanism for the conversion of the acetylenic diol to the final product is shown in Scheme 4. This mechanism is known as a Meyer-Schuster rearrangement.|$|E
5000|$|In higher plants, the {{absorption}} of light continues to increase as light intensity increases, while the capacity for photosynthesis tends to saturate. Therefore there {{is the potential for}} {{the absorption}} of excess light energy by photosynthetic light harvesting systems. This excess excitation energy leads to an increase in the lifetime of singlet excited chlorophyll, increasing the chances of the formation of long-lived chlorophyll triplet states by inter-system crossing. Triplet chlorophyll is a potent photosensitiser of molecular oxygen forming singlet oxygen which can cause oxidative damage to the pigments, lipids and proteins of the photosynthetic thylakoid membrane. To counter this problem, one photoprotective mechanism is so-called non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), which relies upon the conversion and dissipation of the excess excitation energy into heat. NPQ involves conformational changes within the light harvesting proteins of photosystem (PS) II that bring about a change in pigment interactions causing the formation of energy traps. The conformational changes are stimulated by a combination of transmembrane proton gradient, the PsbS subunit of photosystem II and the enzymatic conversion of the carotenoid <b>violaxanthin</b> to zeaxanthin (the xanthophyll cycle).|$|E
40|$|The {{carotenoid}} {{content of}} thylakoids and envelopes isolated from dark-or light-treated spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) chloroplasts was compared. In thylakoids, light induced {{a decrease of}} <b>violaxanthin</b> parallel with a stoichiometric increase of zeaxanthin due to <b>violaxanthin</b> deepoxidation. In envelopes, <b>violaxanthin</b> was also decreased and the relative decrease was similar to thylakoids, but zeaxanthin increase was small resulting in an over-all decrease {{of the amount of}} envelope carotenoids. When <b>violaxanthin</b> deepoxidation in thylakoids was partly inhibited by 10 nm nigericin, <b>violaxanthin</b> decrease in the envelope was inhibited to a similar degree...|$|E
40|$|Using DTT and iodoacetamide as a novel {{irreversible}} {{method to}} inhibit endogenous <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase, {{we found that}} <b>violaxanthin</b> could be converted into zeaxanthin {{from both sides of}} the thylakoid membrane provided that purified <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase was added. The maximum conversion was the same {{from both sides of the}} membrane. Temperature was found to have a strong influence both on the rate and degree of maximal <b>violaxanthin</b> to zeaxanthin conversion. Thus only 50 % conversion of <b>violaxanthin</b> was detected at 4 degreesC, whereas at 25 degreesC and 37 degreesC the degree of conversion was 70 % and 80 %, respectively. These results were obtained with isolated thylakoids from non-cold acclimated leafs. Pigment analysis of sub-thylakoid membrane domains showed that <b>violaxanthin</b> was evenly distributed between stroma lamellae and grana partitions. This was in contrast to chlorophyll a and beta-carotene which were enriched in stroma lamellae fractions while chlorophyll b, lutein and neoxanthin were enriched in the grana membranes. In combination with added <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase we found almost the same degree of conversion of <b>violaxanthin</b> to zeaxanthin (73 - 78 %) for different domains of the thylakoid membrane. We conclude that <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase converts <b>violaxanthin</b> in the lipid matrix and not at the proteins, that <b>violaxanthin</b> does not prefer one particular membrane region or one particular chlorophyll protein complex, and that the xanthophyll cycle pigments are oriented in a vertical manner in order to be accessible from both sides of the membrane when located in the lipid matrix...|$|E
40|$|The {{xanthophyll}} cycle {{involves the}} light-dependent and reversible conversion of <b>violaxanthin</b> to zeaxanthin. Zeaxanthin has {{been implicated in}} {{the protection of the}} photosynthetic machinery from over-excitation. The enzyme <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase catalyses the conversion of <b>violaxanthin</b> to zeaxanthin. The enzyme is located in the thylakoid lumen and its activity is strictly pH controlled. Apart from <b>violaxanthin,</b> ascorbate and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol are required for activity. The Km for ascorbate showed a pH dependence from which we conclude that the acid form of ascorbate is the substrate for the reaction. Release of the enzyme from the thylakoid membrane is strongly pH dependent, with a cooperativity of 4 with respect to protons. A new method for the irreversible inhibition of <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase was developed. From the pH dependence of this inhibition, we suggest that <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase undergoes a conformational change upon membrane binding. Purification of <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase by gel filtration, hydrophobic interaction chromatography and DEAE anion exchange chromatography resulted in a 5 000 -fold enrichment and identification of a 43 kDa protein as <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase. The sequence of the enzyme is unique and show no apparent homology with other known proteins. Pigment analysis of sub-thylakoid membrane domains shows that <b>violaxanthin</b> is evenly distributed in the membrane. Addition of purified <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase to these domains converted <b>violaxanthin</b> to zeaxanthin {{from both sides of the}} membrane to the same maximum degree, independent of pigment-protein complex composition. It is therefore concluded that this conversion takes place in the lipid matrix and not in the pigment-protein complexes. When spinach plants are shifted from low to high light the quantities of the xanthophyll cycle pigments and ascorbate are increased, but the amount and activity of <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase are decreased. The increase in xanthophyll cycle pigments and ascorbate only partly explains the increased rate of conversion of <b>violaxanthin</b> to zeaxanthin. The most probable explanation of a faster conversion is an increased accessibility of <b>violaxanthin</b> in the membrane. Temperature has a strong influence on both the rate and degree of maximum conversion. It is proposed that diffusion of <b>violaxanthin</b> between pigment protein complexes and the lipid matrix regulates the degree of conversion...|$|E
40|$|Bilayer-forming lipids {{were shown}} to be {{ineffective}} in sustaining the enzymatic activity of <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase. On the other hand, non-bilayer-forming lipids, regard-less of their different chemical character, ensured high activity of <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase, resulting in conversion of <b>violaxanthin</b> to zeaxanthin. Our data indicates {{that the presence of}} lipids forming reversed hexagonal structures is necessary for <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase activity and this activity is dependent on the degree of unsaturation of the fatty acids. The significance of the reversed hexagonal phase domains in the conversion of <b>violaxanthin</b> into zeaxanthin in model systems and in the native thylakoid membranes is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Grana and stroma {{lamellae}} fractions prepared from illuminated chloroplasts (Lactuca sativa L. var. Manoa) by French press treatment contained less <b>violaxanthin</b> {{and more}} zeaxanthin than the corresponding fractions from dark controls. In both fractions, {{only part of}} the total <b>violaxanthin</b> was de-epoxidized under illumination, and the ratio of de-epoxidized and unchanged <b>violaxanthin</b> was similar. This not only shows that the de-epoxidation system is present in both grana and stroma thylakoids but also that <b>violaxanthin</b> is heterogeneous in both membranes. The presence and similarity of the de-epoxidation system in grana and stroma lamellae suggest that the function of the <b>violaxanthin</b> cycle is linked to photosynthetic activities which are common to both types of membranes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNon-photochemical {{quenching}} (NPQ) is {{a mechanism}} protecting photosynthetic organisms against excessive irradiation. Here, we analyze a unique NPQ mechanism in the alga Chromera velia, a recently discovered close relative of apicomplexan parasites. NPQ in C. velia is enabled by an operative and fast <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidation to zeaxanthin without accumulation of antheraxanthin. In C. velia <b>violaxanthin</b> {{also serves as}} a main light-harvesting pigment. Therefore, in C. velia <b>violaxanthin</b> acts as a key factor in both light harvesting and photoprotection.

40|$|AbstractZeaxanthin, an {{important}} component in protection against overexcitation in higher plants, is formed from <b>violaxanthin</b> by the enzyme <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase. We have investigated factors that may control the maximal degree of conversion in the <b>violaxanthin</b> cycle. The conversion of <b>violaxanthin</b> to zeaxanthin in isolated spinach thylakoids was followed at different temperatures and {{in the presence of}} lipid packing modifiers. The maximum degree of conversion was found to be 35 %, 70 % and 80 % at 4  °C, 25  °C and 37  °C respectively. In the presence of membrane modifying agents, known to promote non-lamellar structures (HII), such as linolenic acid the conversion increased, and the maximal level of <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidation obtained was close to 100 %. In contrast, substances promoting lamellar phases (Lα), such as α-tocopherol and 8 -cetylether (C 16 EO 8), only 55 % and 35 % of the <b>violaxanthin</b> was converted at 25  °C, respectively. The results are interpreted in light of the lipid composition of the thylakoid membrane, and we propose a model where a negative curvature elastic stress in the thylakoid lipid bilayer is required for <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase activity. In this model zeaxanthin with its longer hydrophobic stretch is proposed to promote lamellar arrangements of the membrane. As a result, zeaxanthin relieves the curvature elastic stress, which in turn leads to inactivation of <b>violaxanthin</b> de-epoxidase...|$|E
