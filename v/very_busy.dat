Originally the Resort Monorail did not stop at the Transportation and Ticket Center (TTC) as it was intended for resort guests only. When Epcot opened in October 1982, the resort line began stopping at TTC to allow resort guests to board the Epcot Center Monorail. Conversely the Express Monorail (Magic Kingdom/parking lot) would not stop at the resorts except during the <b>very</b> <b>busiest</b> of times when the first car would not be loaded and the train would stop {{at the north end of}} the Contemporary to board hotel guests. When Express trains stopped to embark Contemporary guests, clearances were handled by radio dispatch.|$|R

While yachting with President Truman on Memorial Day in 1945, Truman asked Minton to accept an appointment to the position of Solicitor General of the United States.

5|$|After {{two years}} of {{intensive}} work Lissitzky was taken ill with acute pneumonia in October 1923. A few weeks later {{he was diagnosed with}} pulmonary tuberculosis; in February 1924 he relocated to a Swiss sanatorium near Locarno.

5|$|Returning from Europe in October 1921, he {{was invited}} by Prime Minister Billy Hughes to join his {{government}} as Minister for Trade and Customs. Bruce was not interested he {{was the head of}} one of Australia's largest importing houses and thus had a serious conflict of interest with the portfolio, as well as being <b>very</b> <b>busy</b> running the affairs of that business. But he countered by stating that he might feel obliged to accept if the position of Treasurer was offered, knowing that it had already been promised to Walter Massy-Greene. To Bruce's surprise, Hughes agreed, although Massy Greene was to remain the number two in the government and Minister for Defence. Although he had only been in parliament for three years, his business background was highly desirable to Hughes, who was facing growing criticism from the pro-business wing of the party, who had become increasingly suspicious of Hughes and his interventionist approach to the economy. Influential party figures such as Senator George Pearce and the National Union has also identified Bruce as their preferred choice for the treasury.|$|E

Rodgers, because I wanted to inquire what was the right hour to go and infest the President. It was my luck to strike the place in the dead waste and middle of the day, the <b>very</b> <b>busiest</b> time. I perceived that Mr. Rodgers took me for George Francis Train and had {{made up his mind}} not to let me get at the President; so at the end of half an hour I took my letter of introduction from the table and went away. It was a great pity all round, and a great loss to the nation, for I was brim full of the Eastern question. I didn't get to see the President or the Chief Magistrate either, though I had sort of a glimpse of a lady at a window who resembled her portraits.|$|R
