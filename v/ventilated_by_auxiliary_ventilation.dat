40|$|This paper briefly reviews {{prediction}} {{techniques for}} determination of leakage and friction along <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> ducting systems. In order to compare various prediction techniques {{that have been}} developed over the past, a macroscopic investigation of air leakage and friction resistance of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> ducting systems has been undertaken. Measurements were conducted on 450 and 915 mm diameter fabric ducting over 100 m duct length to determine frictional resistances and the extent of leakage. Due to the high degree of accuracy required and the large volume of data that needed to be collected, electronic pressure transducers were used with computer for data recording. Conceptual models that describe the leakage characteristics of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> ducting systems were developed based on this information. It was found that these models provided good correlation with most of the existing prediction techniques. The experimental methodology relying on computer data acquisition has allowed the accuracy of measured values to be treated {{with a high degree of}} confidence. The reliability of the developed models allows prediction of leakage, frictional impedance and airflow with enhanced confidence...|$|R

Firstly, the control system block is described. Then basic fuzzy model is introduced. <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> is time-varying parameters, nonlinear and large hysteresis system. Therefore, the design includes the normalization, reference model, time-delay, sample cycle, calculation method and control rule modification. The partial fan speed adjustment adopts Direct Torque Control (DTC). Based on theoretical analysis and simulation, combing DSP chip with Intelligent Power Module (IPM), <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> fuzzy control adjusting speed experiment system is established.

40|$|Abstract. Gas {{disaster}} and prevention {{is the critical}} issue in heading laneways of underground coal mine. There are two goals needs to meet, one is air quantity requirement and energy conservation during normal ventilation, the other is safety and quickly during gas outburst. Firstly, gas migration character and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> system placements are described in detail. Since two control goals need to reach, a dual-mode fuzzy control strategy for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> is established. Besides weight calculation method which harmonizes subjective and objective weight calculation is put forward. After then, a gas discharging experiment platform including PLC controller, converter and heading laneway simulation model is established {{on the basis of}} theoretical analysis and simulation results. Finally, experimental results have shown that the system can safely and efficiently fulfill the function both at normal ventilation and gas discharging...|$|R

50|$|Flow-through {{ventilation}} is {{the main}} ventilation circuit for the mine. Air enters the mine from surface via a shaft, ventilation raise or adit. The air is distributed through the mine via internal ventilation raises and ramps, and flows are controlled by regulators and permanently mounted <b>ventilation</b> fans. An <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> system takes air from the flow-through system and distributes it to the mine workings via temporarily mounted ventilation fans, venturies and disposable fabric or steel ducting. Auxiliary fan and duct systems may be either forcing systems, where fresh air is pushed into mine headings, or exhausting systems that draw out contaminated air.|$|R

40|$|The current {{trend towards}} the {{adoption}} of retreat longwall mining methods and the associated rapid development of the access drivages has exacerbated the environmental conditions experienced within these workings. The combined use of roof bolt and continuous miner systems has improved the face advance rate within rapid development drivages. In order to maintain adequate dust and gas control {{it is essential that}} the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> and monitoring systems are correctly installed and maintained. The causes of many potential environmental hazards experienced within auxiliary ventilated rapid development drivages, are often attributed to a failure by the workforce and supervisory officials to maintain the correct installation, maintenance and operational standards of the ventilation and mining systems. The potential ventilation hazards encountered may include: the failure to deliver the required fresh air quantity and velocity to rapidly dilute and disperse methane gas liberated {{in the vicinity of the}} cutting face, or the failure to maintain sufficient exhaust air quantity in the vicinity of the cut to adequately capture dust produced on cutting and loading of the extracted mineral. Results of recent research studies have demonstrated that validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation models can adequately replicate examples of good and bad ventilation. CFD models may be constructed and solved to examine the relative ventilation benefits produced by alternative mining and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> configurations. These models enable the practitioner to predict and visualise the velocity, pressure and contaminant fields within an auxiliary ventilated drivage. This research project has developed a prototype educational aid, which animates and visualises these airflow and pollutant dispersion patterns within a Virtual Reality (VR) model. By introducing a pollutant such as methane into the CFD models, the VR simulation highlights regions of potential methane concentration build-up to the trainee. The application also allows the user to select/investigate the environmental consequences of enacting a number of remedial actions...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{relevance}} of finding a patient’s lungs difficult to <b>ventilate</b> <b>by</b> facemask {{during the course of}} anaesthetic induction. In particular, we discuss the issue of whether it is advisable or unnecessary to check the ability to <b>ventilate</b> <b>by</b> facemask before administering a neuromuscular blocking agent. In the light of advances in supraglottic airway technology it has become possible to insert these devices very soon after induction and in a wider variety of patients. Similarly, the development of videolaryngoscopes and rapidly acting drugs such as rocuronium have raised the possibility of earlier, and possibly more successful, tracheal intubation, with the potential result that mask ventilation becomes redundant. However, we conclude by reaffirming its value in airway management strategies...|$|R

Two box-shaped roof cavities were used in the study: one had a volume of 114. 7 cu ft; and the other had a volume of 57. 3 cu ft. Methane concentration was measured at 28 sampling points in the cavities using 21 different combinations of gas emission rates and air velocities.
