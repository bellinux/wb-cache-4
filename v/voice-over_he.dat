5000|$|The one-hour program {{revolved}} around two detectives {{who had their}} own detective agency in Los Angeles. E. L.

His partner Lionel [...] "Brownshoe" [...] Whitney (Jeff Goldblum) was an archetypal accountant, complete with button-down collars and a nagging fiancee (at least for the pilot episode), who had {{always wanted to be a}} 1940s-style Bogart P.I. A running joke was his penchant for reading a series of hard-boiled crime novels, sub-titled, [...] "A Mark Savage Mystery", written by Stephen J. Cannell (though he never wrote such a series of novels), with Goldblum reading particularly purple passages in <b>voice-over.</b> <b>He</b> was sharper than he seemed, although a little naïve and more reasonable than his career path demanded, and had picked up karate to Black Belt standard.|$|E
5000|$|According to Jans B. Wager, Fight Club {{exhibits}} several {{film noir}} characteristics. The film's narrator {{is a white}} male protagonist who provides a subjective <b>voice-over.</b> <b>He</b> is involved in [...] "an erotic triangle" [...] with [...] "a female object of desire" [...] (Marla Singer) and a male antagonist (Tyler Durden), {{all of whom are}} white. The white masculinity in the film differs from noir films by focusing on the upper middle class instead of the lower middle class or the working class. Both of the narrator's counterparts are simultaneously like him and dangerous to him, and the plot takes place in [...] "an urban, crumbling, criminal milieu". With these characteristics, Fight Club masquerades as neo-noir. It is instead best classified as a retro-noir since its presentation of gender roles is [...] "diametrically opposed" [...] to neo-noir films, which in contrast [...] "allow their protagonists to survive, thrive, and commit or solve crimes, with and without male companionship or assistance". The films also present a [...] "more organic" [...] heterosexual coupling than Fight Club.|$|E

5000|$|Meanwhile, the Cultural Revolution {{is about}} to break forth, led by {{adolescents}} seeking to [...] "rebel" [...] against {{those who seek to}} rein them in: their parents, teachers, and even party members the central government deemed dangerous.

He offers them money and to divorce Shujuan.

5000|$|Writing for Philadelphia Inquirer, Tirdad Derakhshani {{reviewed}} the season positively calling it, [...] "Intense, enlightening, brilliant, unnerving, and addictive, Narcos is high-concept drama at its finest." [...] Television critic, Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter also {{reviewed the}} series positively saying, [...] "The series begins {{to find its}} pacing not long after, {{and we see the}} strength of Moura’s acting, which to his credit never races, in the early going, toward over-the-top menace or the drug-lord cliches we're all used to at this point. Credit also the fact that Padilha brings a documentary feel to Narcos." [...] Nancy deWolf Smith of Wall Street Journal wrote, [...] "The omniscient-narrator device works very well for a complex story spanning many years and varied sets of players." [...] Critic Neil Genzlinger of New York Times said, [...] "It’s built on sharp writing and equally sharp acting, as any good series needs to be." [...] However, chief television critic Mary McNamara of Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "It's a grand if inconsistent experiment that, from the moment it opens with a definition of magic realism, wears its considerable ambitions on its sleeve."
