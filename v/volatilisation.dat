60|$|I {{have said}} that Deville depends upon intense heat for {{carrying}} off vapour; and this {{brings me to the}} point of shewing how vapours are carried off. Here is a basin of mercury, which boils easily, as you know, and gives us the opportunity of observing the facts and principles which are to guide us. I have here two poles of the battery, and if I bring them into contact with the mercury, see what a development of vapour we have. The mercury is flying off rapidly; and I might, if I pleased, put all the company around me in a bath of mercury vapour. And so, if we take this piece of lead and treat it in the same way, it will also give off vapour. Observe the fumes that rise from it; and even if it was so far enclosed from the air that you could not form any litharge, you would still have those abundant fumes flying off. I may also take a piece of gold, and shew you the same thing. I have here a piece of gold which I put upon a clean surface of Paris limestone. Applying the heat of the blowpipe to it, you see how the heat drives off the vapour; and if you notice {{at the end of the}} Lecture, you will observe on the stone a purple patch of condensed gold. Thus you see a proof of the <b>volatilisation</b> of gold. It is the same with silver. You will not be startled if I sometimes use one agent and sometimes another to illustrate a particular point. The volatility of gold and silver is the same thing, whether it be effected by the voltaic battery or by the blowpipe. [A lump of silver was placed in a charcoal crucible between the poles of a voltaic battery.] Now, look at the fumes of silver, and observe the peculiar and beautiful green colour which they produce. We shall now shew you this same process of boiling the silver, cast on a screen from the electric lamp which you have before you; and while Dr. Tyndall is kindly getting the lamp ready for this purpose, let me tell you that Deville proposes to throw out in this way all these extraneous things that I have spoken of, except two--namely, iridium and rhodium. It so happens, as he says, that iridium and rhodium do make the metal more capable of resisting the attacks of acids than platinum itself. Alloys are compounded up to 25 per cent. of rhodium and iridium, by which the chemical inaction of the platinum is increased, and also its malleability and other physical properties. [The image of the voltaic discharge through vapour of silver was now thrown upon the screen.] What you have now on the screen is an inverted image of what you saw when we heated the silver before. The fine stream that you see around the silver is the discharge of the electric force that takes place, giving you that glorious green light which you see in the ray; and if Dr. Tyndall will open the top of the lamp, you will see the quantity of fumes that will come out of the aperture, shewing you at once the volatility of silver.|$|E

The effect of gaseous chemical is lost at its intended place of application and may move downwind and affect other plants {{not intended to}} be affected causing crop damage. Herbicides vary in their susceptibility to <b>volatilisation.</b> Prompt incorporation of the herbicide into the soil may reduce or prevent <b>volatilisation.</b> Wind, temperature, and humidity also affect the rate of <b>volatilisation</b> with humidity reducing in. 2,4-D and dicamba are commonly used chemicals that are known to be subject to <b>volatilisation</b> but there are many others.

5000|$|In {{ilmenite}} roasting {{to produce}} synthetic, the magnetic {{properties of the}} ore are changed at high temperatures as ferrite compounds within the ore are oxidized. This results in the separation of oxidised ferric compounds from paramagnetic chromite components [...] within the ore at the reactor outlet where the product may be further refined to synthesize iron or rutile downstream. In roasting gold-bearing sulfide ores, sulfur or arsenic diffusion gradients encourage the migration of gold towards mineral pores. Hence, continual roasting and <b>volatilisation</b> of sulfur and arsenic allows for the coalescence of gold at the surface of mineral particles which can then be separated efficiently by downstream processes such as leaching.|$|E

50|$|Different {{types of}} Synroc waste forms (ratios of {{component}} minerals, specific HIP pressures and temperatures etc.) {{can be developed}} for the immobilisation {{of different types of}} waste. Only zirconolite and perovskite can accommodate actinides. The exact proportions of the main phases vary depending on the HLW composition. For example, Synroc-C is designed to contain about 20 wt.% of calcined HLW and it consists of approximately (in wt.%): 30 — hollandite; 30 — zirconolite; 20 — perovskite and 20 — Ti-oxides and other phases. Immobilising weapons-grade plutonium or transuranium wastes instead of bulk HLW may essentially change the Synroc phase composition to primarily zirconolite-based or a pyrochlore-based ceramic. The starting precursor for Synroc-C fabrication contains ∼57 wt.% TiO2 and 2 wt.% metallic Ti. The metallic titanium provides reducing conditions during ceramic synthesis and helps decrease <b>volatilisation</b> of radioactive cesium.|$|E
50|$|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) {{guidelines}} describe toxicity testing using L. gibba or L. minor as test organisms.

50|$|Most plant nutrients, {{with the}} {{exception}} of nitrogen, originate from the minerals that make up the soil parent material. Some nitrogen originates from rain as dilute nitric acid and ammonia, but most of the nitrogen is available in soils as a result of nitrogen fixation by bacteria. Once in the soil-plant system, most nutrients are recycled through living organisms, plant and microbial residues (soil organic matter), mineral-bound forms, and the soil solution. Both living microorganisms and soil organic matter are of critical importance to this recycling, and thereby to soil formation and soil fertility. Microbial activity in soils may release nutrients from minerals or organic matter for use by plants and other microorganisms, sequester (incorporate) them into living cells, or cause their loss from the soil by <b>volatilisation</b> (loss to the atmosphere as gases) or leaching.|$|E
50|$|Some {{micro-organisms}} {{are able}} to metabolise organic matter and release ammonium in a process called mineralisation. Others take free ammonium and oxidise it to nitrate. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria are capable of metabolising N2 into the form of ammonia in a process called nitrogen fixation. Both ammonium and nitrate can be immobilized by their incorporation into the microbes' living cells, where it is temporarily sequestered {{in the form of}} amino acids and protein. Nitrate may also be lost from the soil when bacteria metabolise it to the gases N2 and N2O. The loss of gaseous forms of nitrogen to the atmosphere due to microbial action is called denitrification. Nitrogen may also be leached from the soil if it {{is in the form of}} nitrate or lost to the atmosphere as ammonia due to a chemical reaction of ammonium with alkaline soil by way of a process called <b>volatilisation.</b> Ammonium may also be sequestered in clay by fixation. A small amount of nitrogen is added to soil by rainfall.|$|E
5000|$|Extensive {{research}} has shown that the SML contains elevated concentration of bacteria, viruses, toxic metals and organic pollutants as compared to the sub-surface water. These materials can be transferred from the sea-surface to the atmosphere in the form of wind-generated aqueous aerosols due to their high vapor tension and a process known as <b>volatilisation.</b> When airborne, these microbes can be transported long distances to coastal regions. If they hit land they can have detrimental effects on animals, vegetation and human health. Marine aerosols that contain viruses can travel hundreds of kilometers from their source and remain in liquid form as long as the humidity is high enough (over 70%). These aerosols are able to remain suspended in the atmosphere for about 31 days. [...] Evidence suggests that bacteria can remain viable after being transported inland through aerosols. Some reached as far as 200 meters at 30 meters above sea level. A month-long study done by scientists in the Tyrrhenian Sea in 1999 revealed that signals of pollution from chemicals of petrogenic origin in the harbor of Livorno was the result of chemicals found in the SML. It was also noted that the process which transfers this material to the atmosphere causes further enrichment in both bacteria and viruses in comparison to either the SML or sub-surface waters (up to three orders of magnitude in some locations).|$|E

Models describing the prediction of volatility and potential fate of these substances in the environment have become an important tool in the pesticide authorisation procedure at the EU level. The main topic {{of this research is}} to assess the rate and extent of <b>volatilisation</b> of ten pesticides after application on field crops. RESULTS: For eight of the ten pesticides, the <b>volatilisation</b> rates modelled with PEARL (Pesticide Emission Assessment at Regional and Local scales) corresponded well to the calculated rates modelled with ADMS (Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System). For the other pesticides, large {{differences were found between the}} models. Formulation might affect the <b>volatilisation</b> potential of pesticides.

40|$|Simulation of <b>volatilisation</b> {{from plants}} is an {{important}} part in pesticide fate models, especially for the models used to predict the concentrations of pesticides in the environment in the registration procedures. Recent efforts to harmonise registration procedures for pesticides in the European Union necessitated {{the development and implementation of}} suitable <b>volatilisation</b> modules within the framework of the EC project APECOP (Effective Approaches for Assessing the Predicted Environmental Concentration of Pesticides). An empirical description to estimate the cumulative <b>volatilisation</b> of pesticides during seven days after application to crops was included in MACRO.

This description was implemented in PELMO (Pesticide Leaching Model). When key parameters had been calibrated (thickness of the air-boundary layer, phototransformation and penetration into the leaves), the approach was able to simultaneously estimate <b>volatilisation</b> of pesticides from plants and soil.

Water-to-air transfer was studied for five structural isomers, namely: the linear isomer (n-PFOA) and the four most commonly occurring branched isomers (3 -, 4 -, 5 - and 6 -PFOA). The influence of water concentration and water type on the pH-dependent water-to-air transfer was also investigated for n-PFOA. The water-to-air transfer was studied {{over the course of}} 48  h at pH values ranging from 0. 2 to 5. 5. Under all experimental conditions tested, the <b>volatilisation</b> of PFOA was negligible at pH >  2. 5. In experiments performed with MilliQ water, <b>volatilisation</b> increased with decreasing water pH. In experiments performed with tap water and lake water, maximum <b>volatilisation</b> was observed at pH 1. The concentration of PFOA in water had no influence on the pH value at which water-to-air transfer was observed (i. e. at pH <  2. 5) for the concentration range tested (0. 1 – 50  μg/L PFOA in deionised water). Although the percentage of PFOA volatilised was significantly different for the four branched isomers at low pH, <b>volatilisation</b> was not observed above pH 2. 5 for any branched isomer suggesting that all PFOA isomers have a low pKa. Overall, these laboratory results demonstrate that <b>volatilisation</b> of any structural isomer of PFOA from water is negligible at environmentally-relevant conditions.

40|$|Environmental fate of {{pollutants}} is paramount to their bioavailability, {{and as such}} their potential toxicity. Soil bound fractions of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as chlorobenzenes are far greater {{than in any other}} environmental compartment. This thesis investigates the potential for <b>volatilisation</b> flux of dichlorobenzene (DCB) from soils under planted and unplanted regimes. It was found that <b>volatilisation,</b> not mineralization, is the main route of DCB removal from soil systems. It was also found that planted systems resulted in a significant increase in <b>volatilisation</b> flux from DCB contaminated soil, in comparison to unplanted systems. It is concluded that the plants have two main interactions with the soil that may lead to this increased <b>volatilisation.</b> These are: (i) the plants transpirational influence dries out the soil; (ii) aromatic acids are released by the plants into the rhizosphere in the form of root exudates. It is shown in this thesis that drier soil has increased rates of <b>volatilisation</b> to the atmosphere than wetter soil. It is also shown in literature (Xing and Pignatello, 1998) that aromatic acids released by plant roots as exudates competitively bind to SOM resulting in the displacement of DCB that may subsequently be volatilised from the soil. Both of these factors in combination explain the resulting flux of volatiles from the soil under planting. It is of critical important to recognise <b>volatilisation</b> as a main route of POP flux from soil systems. Many previous studies may have overlooked <b>volatilisation</b> fluxes from soil in favour of the opinion that mineralization is the main route for removal.

40|$|In {{mixtures}} of polystyrene {{with a fire}} retardant chloroparaffin, the rate of <b>volatilisation</b> of the polymer is initially increased during the thermal dehydrochlorination of the additive. In the residue which results, the <b>volatilisation</b> of polystyrene occurs at a lower rate than when it is heated alone. The mechanisms of the reactions which occur in the mixture are discussed and related to the fire retardant action of the chloroparaffi...|$|E
40|$|The <b>volatilisation</b> of {{ferrocene}} (Fc), {{dissolved in}} the ionic liquid N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide, [C(4) mpyrr][NTf(2) ], {{to the gas}} phase has been indirectly monitored by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Simulation of the observed trends in concentration with time using a simple model allowed quantification of the process. <b>Volatilisation</b> of dissolved Fc under flowing wet and dry dinitrogen gas (N(2)) {{was found to be}} kinetically limited with a rate constant in the region of 2 × 10 (- 7) cm[*]s(- 1). The activation energy of diffusion for Fc was found to be 28. 2 ± 0. 7 kJ[*]mol(- 1), while the activation energy of <b>volatilisation</b> of Fc from [C(4) mpyrr][NTf(2) ] to dry N(2) was found to be 85 ± 2 kJ[*]mol(- 1) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} experiment {{was carried out}} to measure <b>volatilisation</b> fluxes of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from sewage sludge-amended soils. The most commonly practised methods of applying sludge to agricultural land in the UK, namely, surface application, ploughing in to soil and subsurface injection, were simulated inside glass experimental chambers using an anaerobically digested sludge and a sandy loam soil. Humidified air was blown {{over the surface of}} the soil/sludge in the chambers for a period of 32 days, in order to sample a sufficient air volume to detect the volatilising PCBs. The resulting PCB <b>volatilisation</b> fluxes from the different sludge application methods were quantified and compared. <b>Volatilisation</b> fluxes of individual congeners were generally highest for the surface sludge (1 -cm depth) application and slightly lower for the plough layer (5 -cm depth) application. Fluxes from the subsurface layer of sludge (5 -cm depth) were only quantified for the lightest congeners near {{to the end of the}} experimental run-time. Results from a multiple regression analysis showed that <b>volatilisation</b> fluxes of PCBs from the surface application are highly dependent on both the sludge concentration and the log of the octanol-air partition coefficient (KOA). A well-known soil <b>volatilisation</b> model, developed by Jury et al., was adapted and used to predict fluxes for the different sludge application methods during the experiment. The model predicted <b>volatilisation</b> fluxes that were reasonably comparable to measured fluxes for some congeners, but for others predicted fluxes that were more than an order of magnitude lower than measured fluxes. The model predicted similar loss kinetics to those observed in the experiment. Possible reasons for the dissimilarity between measured and predicted fluxes include inaccuracies in model input parameters and the fact that the models were not developed for predicting fluxes from sludge-amended soils...|$|E
40|$|Sugarcane {{grown in}} the Southern African region is reliant on large inputs of {{fertiliser}} nitrogen (up to 200 kg N /ha/crop) for producing optimum sucrose yields. Urea is the preferred N fertiliser, mainly due to a high N concentration [46 %] and a lower price per unit of N compared with its main competitors, limestone ammonium nitrate (LAN [28 %]) and ammonium sulphate (AS [21 %]). While LAN, AS and urea suffer similar field losses of NO 3 -N by leaching and denitrification, urea is subject to additional NH 3 -N losses by <b>volatilisation</b> from both acid and alkaline non-irrigated soils. A new laboratory method was developed to test grower soils for potential ammonia <b>volatilisation</b> from surface-applied urea. An empirical ammonia <b>volatilisation</b> model, based on soil buffer capacity, was developed from these new soil test data, requiring N-rate, soil pH, organic matter, and clay as inputs. The model was used to predict potential ammonia <b>volatilisation</b> losses from selected field trials and laboratory studies in South Africa and the USA. Good correlations between model predictions and experimental results, including sugar yield, highlighted {{the significance of the}} ammonia <b>volatilisation</b> process as a component of overall nitrogen fertiliser efficiency on many sugarcane soils. Possible management options which could improve N fertiliser efficiency on dryland South African sugarcane farms are discussed. These include use of the alternative N sources LAN or AS, broadcasting urea instead of banding, urea burying, fertiliser splitting, and liquid fertilisers...|$|E
