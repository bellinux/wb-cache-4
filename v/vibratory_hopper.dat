A <b>vibratory</b> <b>hopper</b> feeds the seeds onto a transport system for deposit {{in a magazine}} or storage area.

40|$|The six Avicel {{products}} {{designed for}} compression - the classical grades PH- 105, PH- 103, PH- 101 and PH- 102, {{and the new}} Avicels PH- 112 and PH- 200 - have been submitted to a comparative investigation for both their basic and tableting properties. According to the manufacturer all these products differ by their nominal particle size and moisture content. Basic properties of the powders were first determined, namely moisture content (loss on drying and Karl Fischer titration), particle size and shape (sieving and image analysis), densities (true bulk and tap densities, Hausner ratio) and flow properties (<b>vibratory</b> <b>hopper</b> technique). As tableting properties, the compactibility of the powders {{and the effect of}} adding a hydrophobic lubricant (0. 5 % magnesium stearate) on the compact strength were evaluated by preparing compacts at a given applied pressure using a hydraulic press. Weight and dimensional variations were assessed by preparing tablets at a target crushing strength of 70 Newtons on a high speed machine. The comparison of the conventional Avicel PH grades showed that Avicel PH- 105 differed markedly in its properties (high compressibility on tapping, high compactibility, inacceptable tablet weight variability and very poor disintegrating properties) from the other grades. As to the two new Avicel PH grades, conflicting results with the literature were obtained with the low-moisture product Avicel PH- 112. We observed, like other authors but in contrast to manufacturer's data, values of compactibility and strength reduction ratio upon lubrication {{as well as of the}} coefficient of tablet weight variation similar to those of the standard Avicel PH- 102, of comparable particle size. This can be certainly explained by an uptake of moisture of the Avicel PH- 112 powder as proved experimentally. This would limit the use of this material to an air-conditioned room. The large particle size product Avicel PH- 200 displayed a compactibility close to that of all the other Avicel PH grades (except PH- 105), but the highest susceptibility to magnesium stearate. As expected, because it is free-flowing, Avicel PH- 200 gave the lowest tablet weight variability. Additionnally, the two new grades showed disintegrating properties similar to those of Avicel PH- 103, PH- 102 and PH- 101. Finally, one should bear in mind that the small differences reported here may not be significant because of substantial inter batch variability...|$|E
40|$|Póster presentado en la European Geosciences Union General Assembly, celebrada en Viena del 7 al 12 de abril de 2013. The {{understanding}} of key hydrologic processes such as, water erosion, rill network development or agrochemical transport, requires controlled experiments {{at the appropriate}} scale. This {{is the reason for}} experimentation at flume scale in hydro-environmental research, used for many decades in this field. This communication presents a research infrastructure, recently completed in its first stage, consisting of a large flume for studying soil water erosion, sediment transport, and environmental processes such as the transport of different substances (salts, fertilizers, herbicides, carbon,...) rather dissolved or absorbed with the sediment. It is located at the Institute for Sustainable Agriculture (CSIC) in Córdoba, Spain. The flume is 0. 6 m deep, 12 m long, and 6 m wide. It may be divided longitudinally into three channels (6 m long, 1 m wide). The slope of the flume can be regulated from 0 % to 20 %. The device allows studying free surface flows over movable beds with different conditions of sediment transport by supplying clear or sediment-laden water from its head system. The head system consists of three triangular weirs for accurate measurement of water flow, three stilling tanks at the entrance of the flume, and three <b>vibratory</b> <b>hoppers</b> for applying sediments at pre-set rates. The water can be re-circulated, the maximum inflow is then about 30 l s- 1, or evacuated, then the inflow is limited to about 20 l s- 1 Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Producing a {{noiseless}} and vibration free devices {{is a need}} of the day. The vibration causes rapid wear {{of machine}} parts such as bearings and gears. Unwanted vibrations may cause loosening of parts from the machine. Because of improper design or material distribution, the wheels of locomotive can leave the track due to excessive vibration which results in accident or heavy loss. Sometimes because of heavy vibrations proper readings of instrument cannot be taken. Vibration {{can be used for}} useful purposes such as vibration testing equipment's, <b>vibratory</b> conveyors, <b>hoppers,</b> and comparators. Vibration is found to be very fruitful in mechanical workshops such as improving the efficiency of machining, casting, forging and welding techniques. The transfer of noise can also be reduced by decoupling the components {{in such a way that}} the noise path is interrupted. This can be achieved by adding noise reducing treatments to the structure such as elastic elements, masses, local shielding or damping layers. In the present investigation, the use of viscoelastic damping layers as a noise reducing measure in rotating machinery is considered. Here in this investigation the result obtained will give frequency value in random manner and the use of t-test (testing hypothesis) will show us that vibrations are really reduced or not...|$|R
40|$|Bulk solids {{technology}} plays a {{key part}} in manufacturing process when handled material is an assembly of solid particles in large quantities. Micro-dispensing technology for bulk solids can improve operation efficiency in dispensing relatively small amount of material. The demand for the technology covers {{a wide range of}} areas where materials have diverse flow behaviours and flow problems due to different physical properties. This Ph. D. project aims to investigate bulk solids flow behaviour and fluidizing mechanism in a hopper under the influence of vibration, and to develop a bulk solids micro-dispensing technique to demonstrate the dispensing process of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), excipients and biomaterials. Experiment work in this project includes design of <b>vibratory</b> dispenser <b>hopper</b> and dispensing test with vibratory dispensers where mechanical vibration and ultrasonic vibration is utilized as the driving force to fluidize coarse granules and fine powders, respectively. The results suggest that the vibratory dispenser is capable of accurately and fast dispensing “dropwise” bulk solid in a small amount per drop. A doming controlled flow mechanism is identified in the vibratory dispenser. Bulk solids dome formed in the dispenser hopper plays as a “valve” of flow under the influence of vibration. The dispensing test results show that the design parameters of dispenser hopper, i. e. orifice size, hopper angle and hopper diameter, and vibration signal parameters, i. e. frequency and amplitude, affect the flow rate and dosage conformity in the vibratory bulk solids micro-dispensing technique. Additionally, a triboelectric charging phenomenon is investigated in the ultrasonic vibration dispenser and a solution to the charging issue is proposed with modifying surfaces of dispenser hopper by using platinum plating method. Pt-coated surface reduces the triboelectric charge generated in the dispensing process and improves the flowability of powders. The correlation between discharge rate and design parameters of ultrasonic vibration dispenser is derived. The derived equations are used to predict dosing results in the application of producing solid form oral drugs and biomaterial dry powder libraries for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiment. <br/...|$|R
