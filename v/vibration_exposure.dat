Little experimental evidence exists to corroborate the strong epidemiological link between intervertebral disc herniations and <b>vibration</b> <b>exposures</b> using basic scientific approaches. The {{purpose of the current}} investigation was to provide some basic experimental evidence of the epidemiological link between intervertebral herniation and <b>exposure</b> to <b>vibration.</b> 	Partial intervertebral disc herniations were created in in-vitro porcine functional spinal units using a herniation protocol of repetitive flexion/extension motions under modest compressive forces. After herniation initiation, functional spinal units were exposed to 8 different vibration and postural constraint loading protocols consisting of two postural conditions (full flexion and neutral) and 4 vibration loading conditions (whole-body vibration, shock loading, static compressive loads, and whole-body vibration in addition to shock loading) to assess the effects of vibration and posture on functional spinal unit damage progression. There were three main outcome variables used to quantify damage progression; average stiffness changes, herniation distance progression (distance of tracking changes), and specimen height changes, while cumulative loading factors were considered. Additionally the concordance between two types of contrast enhanced medical imaging (Computed Tomography and discograms) was qualified to a dissection ‘gold standard’, and an attempt was made to classify disc damage progression via three categorical variables. 	Concordance to a dissection ‘gold standard’ was higher for the Computed Tomography medical imaging type that for the Discograms. The categorical criteria used to qualify disc damage progression were insufficiently sensitive to detect damage progressions illustrated through dissection and medical imaging techniques. The partial herniation loading protocol was quantified to be more damaging overall to the functional spinal units compared to the vibration and postural constraint loading protocols. However, the vibration and postural constraint loading protocols provided sufficient mechanical insult to the functional spinal units to progress damage to the intervertebral discs. <b>Vibration</b> loading <b>exposures</b> were found to alter specimen height changes and distance of tracking changes, however posture had no significant effects on these variables.

50|$|In {{the railway}} industry, there are risk factors {{involved}} with the prolonged usage of maintenance of way vehicles by vehicle operators during day-to-day track maintenance and construction. A common risk factor is prolonged exposure to excessive whole body vibration and shock exposure to the vertical and horizontal axes of the lumbar spine and vertebral endplate {{which can lead to}} spinal injury and or long-term damage to the vertebral bone structure. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists has in the past proposed threshold limit values for whole-body vibration with certain guidelines also being based on ISO-2631 standards, but no official exposure threshold limits for maintenance of way vehicles have seen widespread publication or enforcement. The ACGIH-TLV limits worker whole-body <b>vibration</b> <b>exposure</b> to no more than 8 hours in duration. In the European Union a new risk assessment model (VibRisk model) for structural failure of the lumbar spine in the lower back was proposed as a result of vibration risk research. The VibRisk model provides more specific risk assessments of vertebral endplate failure on individual lumbar levels taking into account driver posture. When compared the risk assessment proposed using the VibRisk Model posed a higher risk of vertebral endplate failure at different lumbar levels than ISO-2631 Part 5 standards suggested. The main contributing factor that VibRisk incorporates that the ISO-2631 Part 5 standards are lacking is the recognition of operator posture as an additional stress factor when exposed to vibration and multiple shocks.|$|E
40|$|Standards for hand-transmitted {{vibration}} predict {{dependent variables}} (e. g. finger blanching) from measurements {{of a few}} independent variables (e. g. vibration magnitude, <b>vibration</b> frequency, <b>exposure</b> duration). This paper illustrates the assumptions in the current International Standard guidelines {{for the evaluation of}} hand-transmitted vibration and compares research methods which may provide information to improve the guidance. Subjective assessments of vibration discomfort have influenced the frequency weighting used in current standards, but the data have been modified greatly for this purpose. Subjective and biodynamic data suggest that the severity of vibration may not be similar for vibration occurring in different axes.

Future experimental studies in humans are unlikely to be sufficient to determine how injury depends on the characteristics of <b>vibration</b> <b>exposures</b> at work. Epidemiological studies are required to uncover the effects of occupational exposures, but the complexity of occupational exposures will prevent the formulation of standards based solely on the results of epidemiological studies.

40|$|Sheet metal workers {{operating}} rivet {{bucking bars}} {{are at risk}} of developing hand and wrist musculoskeletal disorders associated with <b>exposures</b> to hand-transmitted <b>vibrations</b> and forceful exertions required to operate these hand tools. New bucking bar technologies have been introduced in efforts to reduce workplace <b>vibration</b> <b>exposures</b> to these workers. However, the efficacy of these new bucking bar designs has not been well documented. While there are standardized laboratory-based methodologies for assessing the vibration emissions of many types of powered hand tools, no such standard exists for rivet bucking bars. Therefore, this study included the development of a laboratory-based method for assessing bucking bar vibrations which utilizes a simulated riveting task. With this method, this study evaluated three traditional steel bucking bars, three similarly shaped tungsten alloy bars, and three bars featuring spring-dampeners. For comparison the bucking bar vibrations were also assessed during three typical riveting tasks at a large aircraft maintenance facility. The bucking bars were rank-ordered in terms of unweighted and frequency-weighted acceleration measured at the hand-tool interface. The results suggest that the developed laboratory method is a reasonable technique for ranking bucking bar vibration emissions; the lab-based riveting simulations produced similar rankings to the workplace rankings. However, the laboratory-based acceleration averages were considerably lower than the workplace measurements. These observations suggest that the laboratory test results are acceptable for comparing and screening bucking bars, but the laboratory measurements should not be directly used for assessing the risk of workplace bucking bar <b>vibration</b> <b>exposures.</b> The newer bucking bar technologies exhibited significantly reduced vibrations compared to the traditional steel bars.

50|$|Because workers {{maintain}} the same posture over long work days and often several years, even natural postures like standing {{can lead to}} MSDs like low back pain, but postures which are less natural like twisting or tension in the upper body are typically contributors {{to the development of}} MSDs because of the unnatural biomechanical load of these postures. There is evidence that posture contributes to MSDs of the neck, shoulder, and back. Repeated motion is another risk factor for MSDs of occupational origin because workers can perform the same movements repeatedly {{over long periods of time}} (e.g. typing leading to carpal tunnel syndrome), which can wear on the joints and muscles involved in the motion in question. Workers doing repetitive motions at a high pace of work with little recovery time and workers with little to no control over the timing of motions (e.g. workers on assembly lines) are also prone to MSDs due to the motion of their work. Force needed to perform actions on the job can also be associated with higher MSD risk in workers, because movements which require more force can fatigue muscles quicker which can lead to injury and/or pain. Additionally, exposure to vibration (as in truck drivers or construction workers, for example) and extreme hot or cold temperatures can affect a worker's ability to judge force and strength, which can lead to development of MSDs. <b>Vibration</b> <b>exposure</b> is also associated with hand-arm vibration syndrome, which has symptoms of lack of blood circulation to the fingers, nerve compression, tingling, and/or numbness.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Introduction. The high {{prevalence}} of {{low back pain}} in drivers of commercial motor vehicles is well-documented. A number of interventions to reduce low back pain in commercial motor vehicle operators have focused on reducing <b>exposures</b> to wholebody <b>vibration</b> (WBV). Objective. An intervention to be evaluated for the trucking industry is an air-filled ballistic seat pad designed to reduce exposure to WBV. The effectiveness of the seat pad in semi-trucks {{has not yet been}} established. Results from a previous pilot study involving 12 -ton and 16 -ton vibratory rollers used by Seattle Public Utility drivers suggest that the seat pad is not effective at very low speeds (1 - 3 mph). Methods. The current study measures, characterizes and compares WBV exposures in nine truck drivers who operated their trucks over the same roads. WBV exposures were compared between their existing air-suspension seat and the air-filled ballistic seat pad which sat on top of their existing seat. This study uses a Wilcoxon signed rank test to compare the seat pad’s effectiveness in reducing WBV exposures relative to their existing air-suspension seat. Results. Overall, the truck drivers' <b>vibration</b> <b>exposures</b> were above daily vibration action values set by the International Standards Organization (ISO) and the air-filled ballistic seat pad did not significantly reduce WBV exposures relative to the WBV exposures experienced with their existing air-suspension seat. Conclusions. In the semi-trucks evaluated in this study, the air-filled ballistic seat pad was not effective in reducing WBV exposures. The seat pad {{has been shown to be}} effective in reducing WBV exposures in public transportation buses and cars. The answer for why the air-filled seat pads were not effective in semi-trucks may lie in a future analysis of the power spectral densities, which shows the <b>vibration</b> <b>exposures</b> as a function of frequency. Buses and cars produce more high frequency vibration energy, and the air-filled seat pad has been shown to be effective in these vehicles when travelling at moderate to high speeds. Trucks may produce less high frequency vibration energy, and this may have diminished the air-filled seat pad’s effectiveness in the semi-truck evaluated in this study...|$|R

One of the most frequent symptoms is the hand-arm vibration syndrome commonly known as white fingers. The proportions of the international workforce exposed to vibrations are high and dominating sectors are construction, agriculture, forestry, and transport. Particularly exposed construction occupational groups include machine operators and drivers of vehicles. In 2005, the Swedish Work Environment Authority introduced a new guideline {{on the topic of}} preventing <b>vibration</b> <b>exposure</b> risks (AFS 2005 : 15) based on the European union 2002 / 44 /EC directive on workers’ exposure to vibration.

According to the AUROC analysis, the predictive power of each exposure was significant, and increased when the two exposures were considered in combination. The findings of this study show that both occupational noise and vibration exposures are associated with headache/eyestrain; noise exposure more strongly so. However, when the two exposures are considered in combination, the explanatory power for headache/eyestrain is increased. Therefore, efforts aimed at reducing and managing occupational noise and <b>vibration</b> <b>exposure</b> are crucial to maintaining workers' health...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle was {{studied in}} 20 patients suffering from hand-arm vibration syndrome. The main morphological changes observed were centrally located myonuclei and fibre type grouping (found in all 20 muscle biopsies), angulated muscle fibres (found in 19 biopsies), ring fibres and regenerating fibres (found in 18 biopsies) and fibrosis (found in 17 biopsies). The observed abnormalities {{are believed to}} reflect damage to both the muscle fibres and the motor nerve. The changes were related to different <b>vibration</b> <b>exposure</b> parameters. The number of fibres demonstrating centrally located nuclei correlated significantly with the cumulative <b>vibration</b> <b>exposure,</b> {{while the number of}} angulated fibres correlated significantly with the total <b>vibration</b> <b>exposure</b> time. This indicates that the vibrating tools may cause direct damage to muscle fibres as well as nerves...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Although {{the risks}} {{associated}} with <b>vibration</b> <b>exposure</b> have been known for a long time, the importance of risk prevention has increased in Europe since the implementation of the Machine Directives in 1989 (1989 / 392 /EC) and the Vibration Directive in 2002 (2002 / 44 /CE). These Directives challenged manufacturers to design low-vibration tools, and employers to manage the sitespecific risks of <b>vibration</b> <b>exposure.</b> Field experience has shown that many companies using vibrating tools have never carried out a risk-management program, and that they continue to ignore their responsibilities in the Vibration Directive. Because of this, European States are now developing alternative approaches to prevention, which typically shift the balance of risk management responsibility entirely onto employers. The ongoing challenge will be to increase workplace awareness of, and attention to, the risks of <b>vibration</b> <b>exposure...</b>|$|E

40|$|Real-world whole-body <b>vibration</b> <b>exposures</b> {{comprise}} {{motion in}} fore-aft, lateral and vertical directions simultaneously. There {{can also be}} components of roll, pitch and yaw. If evaluating vibration with respect to human response, most investigators will use methods defined in ISO 2631 - 1. This uses frequency weightings that were originally derived from laboratory studies of the subjective responses to vibration in one direction at a time. This paper describes experiments carried out using a 6 degree-of-freedom vibration simulator to validate the applicability of ISO 2631 - 1 in multi-axis environments. 15 subjects were exposed to 87 stimuli comprising single-axis, dual-axis and tri-axial random vibration, {{to which they were}} required to produce subjective ratings. It is shown that in this study the root-sum-of-squares method of summation of subjective ratings in individual axes was an adequate technique for prediction of subjective rating of multiaxis vibration. Better agreement between objective and subjective measures of vibration was obtained for unweighted vibration than for frequency weighted signals. The best agreement for this study was achieved when axis multiplying factors were set at 2. 2 and 2. 4 for x- and y-axis vibration respectively. Different values could be appropriate for other postures, seats, and vibration conditions and should be determined in future studies...|$|R
