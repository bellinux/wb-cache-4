50|$|A {{ceiling balloon}} is a small, usually red, (fluted) rubber balloon {{commonly}} measuring 76 mm (3 in) across prior to inflation, inflated to ~40 cm diameter. After inflation the balloon is taken outside and released. By timing the balloon from release until {{it enters the}} cloud a ceiling height can be obtained. When correctly inflated the balloon will rise at rate of 140 m/min (460 ft/min). The bases of clouds are very rarely flat and solid, so the ceiling height is not when the balloon disappears but when the colour begins to fade. The balloon {{can also be used}} to measure the <b>vertical</b> <b>visibility</b> into a layer of fog or blowing snow.

Some studies found that the higher the perceived risk, the closer the hazard was to occupants (Kuligowski and Mileti 2009), while other studies did not find this effect (Fahy and Proulx 2002). It is possible that other factors, such as the relative location of occupants to the hazard and known exit routes modulate the effect of hazard proximity. <b>Visibility,</b> <b>vertical</b> and horizontal distance, or other factors, may be important confounding factors.

40|$|An ortho-polygon {{visibility}} {{representation of}} an n-vertex embedded graph G (OPVR of G) is an embedding preserving drawing of G that maps every vertex to a distinct orthogonal polygon and each edge to a <b>vertical</b> or horizontal <b>visibility</b> between its end-vertices. The vertex complexity of an OPVR of G is the minimum k such that every polygon has at most k reflex corners. We present polynomial time algorithms that test whether G has an OPVR and, if so, compute one of minimum vertex complexity. We {{argue that the}} existence and the vertex complexity of an OPVR of G are related to its number of crossings per edge and to its connectivity. Namely, we prove that if G is 1 -plane (i. e., it has at most one crossing per edge) an OPVR of G always exists while {{this may not be}} the case if two crossings per edge are allowed. Also, if G is a 3 -connected 1 -plane graph, we can compute in O(n) time an OPVR of G whose vertex complexity is bounded by a constant. However, if G is a 2 -connected 1 -plane graph, the vertex complexity of any OPVR of G may be Ω(n). In contrast, we describe a family of 2 -connected 1 -plane graphs for which an embedding that guarantees constant vertex complexity can be computed. Finally, we present the results of an experimental study on the vertex complexity of OPVRs of 1 -plane graphs...|$|R

In 2015, Terra Messflug (TM), a subsidiary of Vermessung AVT ZT GmbH (Imst, Austria), has flown a number of urban areas in Austria, Czech Republic and Hungary with an UltraCam Osprey Prime multi-head camera system from Vexcel Imaging. In collaboration with FBK Trento (Italy), the data acquired at Imst (a small town in Tyrol, Austria) were analysed and processed to extract precise 3 D topographic information.

Fuzzy logic is one of the popular techniques in the broad field of artificial intelligence and ability to improve performance similar to human reasoning and describe complex systems in linguistic terms instead of numerical values. In this thesis, a system was established based on Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) in which output data such as traffic Accident Rate (AR) and input data such as various highway geometric elements. The study was conducted on two road segments from plain & rolling terrain highway and two road segments from mountainous & steep terrain highway within the rural area of the Indian Territory.
