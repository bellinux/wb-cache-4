5000|$|Cissus {{antarctica}} {{is often}} used as a <b>vine</b> in subtropical <b>climates,</b> such as California, as an ornamental plant in gardens. Kangaroo vine also is a popular interior or houseplant, a well adapted plant, even in subdued light. It does not do well above 15°C, especially when exposed to central heating, which can cause the leaves to drop.|$|R
50|$|Tinta Cão {{is a red}} Portuguese {{wine grape}} variety that has been grown {{primarily}} in the Douro region since the sixteenth century. The vine produces very low yields which has led it close to extinction despite the high quality of wine that it can produce. Improvements in bilateral cordon training and experiments at University of California, Davis have helped to sustain the variety. The <b>vine</b> favors cooler <b>climates</b> and can add finesse and complexity to a wine blend.|$|R
5000|$|At Brading Villa a {{field system}} can be seen near Brading Down; the remains {{associated}} with the villa {{can be seen as}} low banks. The chalk downland was cultivated in prehistoric and Roman times because the light chalk soil was not too difficult to plough. [...] It is very likely indeed that the Romans grew <b>vines,</b> as the <b>climate</b> was then warmer than it is now, and on this basis nearby Adgestone Vineyard claims to be the oldest in Britain.|$|R

500|$|The Carménère grape {{has known}} {{origins in the}} Médoc region of Bordeaux, France and was also widely planted in the Graves until the vines were struck with oidium.

Yields were lower than other varieties and the crops were rarely healthy; consequently wine growers chose more versatile and less coulure-susceptible grapes when replanting the vines and Carménère planting was progressively abandoned.|$|R
40|$|Potential {{interactions}} between {{climate change and}} exotic plant invasions may affect areas of high conservation value, such as land {{set aside for the}} protection of endangered species or ecological communities. We investigated this issue in eastern Australia using species distribution models for five exotic <b>vines</b> under <b>climate</b> regimes for 2020 and 2050. We examined how projected changes in the distribution of climatically suitable habitat may coincide with the remaining remnants of an endangered ecological community-littoral rainforests-in this region. The number of known infestations of each weed in tropical, subtropical and temperate areas was used to assess the likelihood of further expansion into areas projected to provide suitable habitat under future conditions. Littoral rainforest reserves were consistently predicted to provide bioclimatically suitable habitat for the five vines examined under both current and future climate scenarios. We explore the consequences and potential strategies for managing exotic plant invasions in these protected areas in the coming decades. 15 page(s...|$|R

40|$|In oenology, sensory {{evaluation}} {{is an important}} tool that enologists have to assess {{the quality of the}} wines. Consists in evaluate wines aiming to identify its defects and describe the qualitative attributes, regarding visual, olfactive and gustative characteristics (Rizzon, 2010). There are many factors affecting composition and quality of wines. Among them, soil, <b>climate,</b> <b>vine</b> management and winemaking process (Sánchez and Dokoozlian, 2005). Through chemical and sensory analyses, wines can be characterized by explaining their qualities and typicality. In this way, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of rootstocks, clones and harvest date on sensory characteristics of 'Syrah' wines, from grapes cultivated in a partner winery, in Lagoa Grande, Pernambuco state, Brazil, from 2009 and 2010 vintages. 201...|$|R
25|$|The {{annual growth}} cycle of grapevines {{is the process}} {{that takes place in}} the {{vineyard}} each year, beginning with bud break in the spring and culminating in leaf fall in autumn followed by winter dormancy. From a winemaking perspective, each step in the process plays a vital {{role in the development of}} grapes with ideal characteristics for making wine. Viticulturalists and vineyard managers monitor the effect of <b>climate,</b> <b>vine</b> disease and pests in facilitating or impeding the vines progression from bud break, flowering, fruit set, veraison, harvesting, leaf fall and dormancy-reacting if need be with the use of viticultural practices like canopy management, irrigation, vine training and the use of agrochemicals. The stages of the annual growth cycle usually become observable within the first year of a vine's life. The amount of time spent at each stage of the growth cycle depends on a number of factors-most notably the type of climate (warm or cool) and the characteristics of the grape variety.|$|R
60|$|Both Andries and Frank look surprised; but I {{led them}} to a bench on the open side of the court, and invited them to be seated, while I {{explained}} myself. It may be well {{to say a word}} of that seat in passing. It stood {{on the verge of a}} low cliff of rocks, on the side of the court which had been defended by palisades, when the French held the Canadas, and the remains of which were still to be seen. Here, as I was told before we left the spot, Dus, my pretty chainbearer, with a woman's instinct for the graceful and the beautiful, had erected an arbor, principally with her own hands, planted one of the swift-growing <b>vines</b> of our <b>climate,</b> and caused a seat to be placed within. The spot commanded a pleasing view of a wide expanse of meadows, and of a distant hill-side, that still lay in the virgin forest. Andries told me that his niece had passed much of her leisure time in that arbor, since the growth of the plant, with the advance of the season, had brought the seat into the shade.|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Early {{defoliation}} {{has been}} proposed {{as a tool to}} reduce bunch susceptibility to fungal infections through a reduction in bunch compactness. This research aims to determine the desired level of defoliation producing looser bunches and to investigate the impact of the application of early defoliation on Pinot Noir <b>vines</b> under cool <b>climate</b> conditions. Methods and Results: We applied leaf removal treatments at full flowering or EL- 20 phenological stage on Pinot Noir in 2 consecutive years using five levels of defoliation: no leaves removed, and leaves removed from four, six, eight and ten basal nodes. The effects on fruitset, bunch morphology, fruit chemistry, yield and rot severity were recorded. We identified the defoliation of eight basal nodes as the threshold resulting in significantly lower fruitset. The removal of eight or ten leaves reduced bunch compactness but did not alter the proportion of rot. Finally, fruit composition at harvest of the treated vines was found to be improved compared with that of the control vines. Conclusions: The defoliation of six to eight basal nodes at full flowering can regulate fruitset and bunch compactness in Pinot Noir under cool climate conditions. Application over 2 years showed no adverse effects on bud fruitfulness or vine performance the following year. Significance of the Study: Early leaf removal can be an efficient tool to alter bunch architecture, yield and fruit composition without impacting vine healt...|$|R
40|$|Black {{foot disease}} causes death of {{infected}} grapevines but management of this soil-borne disease by preventative {{measures such as}} pre-planting fungicide dips has not been totally effective. Hot water treatment (HWT; 50 °C for 30 min) of young dormant grapevine plants {{has been shown to}} significantly reduce infection. However, it has been reported to cause unacceptable damage to young <b>vines</b> in cooler <b>climate</b> countries like New Zealand, so this study examined the effects of different HWT protocols on the New Zealand black foot isolates. In vitro testing of different HWT protocols was conducted on conidia, mycelium and detached, inoculated grapevine canes using three isolates each of the species I. liriodendri (“ C ”. liriodendri) and the complexes, I. radicicola (“ C ”. destructans) and I. macrodidyma (“ C ”. macrodidymum). Heat treatments greater than 40 °C for 5 min killed all conidia (P< 0. 001), and treatments greater than 47 °C for 30 min inhibited (P≤ 0. 003) further growth of treated mycelium plugs for all but one isolate. Within cane pieces, infection by Ilyonectria (“ Cylindrocarpon ”) isolates was significantly reduced (P< 0. 001) by 30 min at 48. 5 and 50 °C. Additionally, these studies showed different responses to the different treatments for the three isolates of each species complex and differences between species. In field trials, HWT of 48. 5 and 50 °C for 30 min significantly reduced disease incidence in dormant plants to 0 % (P≤ 0. 001). This study confirmed that HWT of 48. 5 °C for 30 min could be used to eliminate black foot disease in dormant nursery grapevines grown in New Zealand prior to their use for establishing new vineyards...|$|R
