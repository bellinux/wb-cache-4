40|$|Introduction:The pungency {{of extra}} virgin olive oil (EVOO) is {{attributed}} to one of its phenolic compounds called oleocanthal (OC) and is mediated through the transient receptor channel potential cation channel ankyrin subtype 1 (TRPA 1) expressed in the posterior oropharynx. EVOO also mimics the pharmacology of ibuprofen in that both agents cause a dose-dependent inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes COX- 1 and COX- 2. EVOO sensitivity has been described in the literature previously however EVOO desensitization has not. Herein we report the first case of successful EVOO desensitization using a novel EVOO desensitization protocol. Case description: A 25 -year-old patient with medical history significant for aspirin sensitivity, exercise induce asthma and mixed <b>vasomotor</b> and allergic <b>rhinitis</b> presented with a history of facial and tongue pruritus, throat irritation, coughing and hives within minutes of olive oil consumption. Symptoms required diphenhydramine however several prior episodes required epinephrine. A series of food and drug challenges were entertained to establish the mechanism of EVOO sensitivity in this patient. Also a novel EVOO desensitization protocol was devised. Discussion:EVOO desensitization has not been reported previously in the literature and in this report we describe the first case of successful EVOO desensitization using a novel EVOO desensitization protocol. Furthermore the patient continues to be in a desensitized state 2 years after the procedure maintained with daily doses of 10 ml EVOO. Although the mechanism of her reaction is likely due to OC stimulation of TRPA 1, the mechanism of desensitization and maintenance of the desensitized state is unclear and requires further study...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) implies {{inflammation}} of the nose and paranasal sinuses {{which may or may}} not have an infectious component and includes nasal polyposis (NP). Chronic rhinosinusitis signs and symptoms persist over 12 weeks and may involve acute exacerbations. It affects around 15 % of the population and causes significant reduction in quality of life. The diagnosis is based largely on symptoms with confirmation by nasendoscopy. Computerized tomography scans may confirm mucosal abnormalities in the paranasal sinuses. Various underlying conditions such as infections, anatomical variations, immunodeficiency, aspirin intolerance, mucociliary impairment and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis may present as CRS. Recently found Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin superantigens, their intracellular long-term persistence, and the production of biofilms may contribute to the pathogenesis of CRS with and without NP. No one single causative factor has been identified that fully accounts for all CRS variations. Various inflammatory processes are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. Characteristic histomorphological features of CRS without NP are a neutrophilic inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia, thickening of the basement membrane, limited subepithelial oedema, and prominent fibrosis. Nasal polyps show a predominant eosinophilic inflammation and the destruction of connective tissue. Recent research has focused on cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and metalloproteinases to explain these features, but the aetiology of NP remains largely unclear. Because of the complex pathogenesis of CRS and the multiplicity of factors playing a role in the aetiology, the current management of CRS remains a challenge. The evidence of a few good quality trials in this area suggests that treatment is primarily medical, involving corticosteroids, antibiotics, saline douching, antileukotrienes, and antihistamines and that surgery should be considered for complications, anatomical variations causing local obstruction, allergic fungal disease or for patients who remain very symptomatic despite maximal medical treatment. Objectives: To review the literature on conservative, non-surgical treatments for CRS with or without NP, to evaluate their effectiveness and safety, and to analyse their strength of evidence, recommendations and clinical usefulness in the management of these chronic disease. A succinct update of CRS definition and classification and its pathophysiology is provided. Search strategy: The search included MEDLINE (1950 – 2009) and THE COCHRANE LIBRARY. The date of the last search was June 2009. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled and prospective, clinically-relevant trials in which any non-surgical treatment was evaluated in patients with CRS with or without NP, and after surgery to prevent disease recurrence. The diagnosis of seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis was an exclusion criterion. Data collection and analysis: Trials were graded for methodological quality and assigned an evidence level based on the modified Sekelle's evidence scale. Each category of articles was then assigned an overall grade for the strength of evidence [I (strongest) to IV (weakest) ], a grade for recommendation [A (strongest: consistent level I studies) to D (weakest: level IV evidence or extrapolated recommendation from any level) ], and the clinical relevance. Results: Two hundred and eight trials were identified that satisfied the inclusion criteria. The retained studies could be grouped as followed: antibiotics (22 trials), antifungal agents (10 trials), antihistamines (11 trials), antileukotrienes (11 trials), aspirin desensitisation and maintenance (16 trials), bacterial lysate preparations (3 trials), capsaicin (12 trials), corticosteroids (36 trials), cromolyn sodium (5 trials), decongestants (4 trials), furosemide (4 trials), gastroesophageal reflux therapy (4 trials), immunotherapy (4 trials), ipratropium bromide (21 trials), nasal irrigation (20 trials), mucoactive agents (7 trials), phytopreparations (7 trials), homeopathies (2 trials), acupuncture (6 trials) and immunomodulatory agents (3 trials). There is strong evidence [Ib-evidence] that long-term intranasal steroids are beneficial in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of CRS with and without NPs and for the prevention of disease recurrence after surgery. Short-course systemic corticosteroids should only be used as rescue medication in cases of severe NP [Ibevidence]. Strong evidence also exists in favour of systemic long-term macrolides in CRS without [Ib-evidence] and with NPs [III-evidence], long-term saline irrigation's in CRS without NPs [Ib-evidence] and less, of topical capsaicin [Ib/III-evidence] in CRS with and without NPs. Strong evidence has been demonstrated for the long-term systemic antileukotriene [Ib-evidence], and aspirin desensitisation/ maintenance [Ibevidence] treatments in the management of the aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (asthma, NPs and aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug intolerance); a specific subgroup of CRS with NPs. Antileukotrienes seem evidently prevent NP recurrence after surgery [Ib-evidence]. Short-course systemic treatment of decongestants and mucoactive agents show evidently an improvement of CRS symptoms [Ib-evidence]. Good evidence also exists in favour of long-term courses of topical and systemic antihistamines [Ib-evidence] and intranasal ipratropium bromide [Ib-evidence] in the treatment of rhinorrhea and less, nasal congestion in non-allergic, non-infectious perennial <b>rhinitis</b> (<b>vasomotor</b> rhinitis); a subclass of CRS without NPs. Bacterial lysate preparations show good evidence in the treatment of symptoms and particularly reduce the frequency of acute infectious episodes in CRS without NPs [Ib-evidence]. Studies dealing with olfaction and QoL outcome are rare, demonstrating significant improvement in the treatment groups of AS desensitisation and topical / systemic steroids, and in the treatment groups of long-term macrolides, antileukotrienes, systemic steroids, topical ipratropium bromide and saline irrigations, respectively. An excellent safety profile could be demonstrated for these drug categories. Intranasal antibiotics [Ib(-) -evidence], topical and systemic antifungal agents [Ib(-) -evidence], intranasal cromolyn sodium [Ib(-) -evidence], topical decongestants [Ib(-) -evidence], topical mucoactive agents [Ib(-) -evidence], homeopathy [Ib(-) - evidence], and acupuncture [Ib(-) -evidence] cannot be recommended due to evidenced negative outcome in randomized trials or bad safety profile. Due to the lack of randomized, placebo controlled studies or unclear outcome, the other treatment categories like topical furosemide, gastroesophageal reflux therapy, immunotherapy, topical and systemic phytopreparations and immunomodulators cannot be retained as first-choice therapy options or are not clinically relevant in the management of CRS with or without NPs. Conclusions: The often imprecise definitions of CRS, complex pathogenesis and uncertainties regarding the precise role played by the involved processes and a lack of well designed trials render an analysis of the retained data difficult. The initial management of CRS is medically with endoscopic sinus surgery reserved for refractory CRS. First-choice drug treatment in CRS with or without NPs comprises long-term topical steroids and short-term systemic corticosteroids for severe disease. Intranasal steroids also prevent NP recurrences after surgery. Long-term systemic, low-dose macrolides with their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-mucous and less, antimicrobial actions seem to be a good alternative treatment modality in steroid non-responders. Long-term saline irrigation's may be used singly or as adjunct therapy. Antileukotriene and aspirin desensitisation / maintenance therapy can be considered for aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease. Promising antiinflammatory agents include topical capsaicin and systemic bacterial lysate preparations. Topical and systemic antihistamines and intranasal ipratropium bromide demonstrated improvement in the treatment of rhinorrhea and less, nasal congestion in vasomotor rhinitis; a specific subclass of non-allergic, non-infectious perennial rhinitis. New approaches are currently evolving, specifically targeting eosinophilic recruitment (chemokine receptor 3, eotaxins) and inflammation (interleukin- 4, - 5, - 13), immunoglobulin E, or tissue remodelling by reducing the activity of metalloproteinases. Better uniform definitions and classifications of CRS with and without NPs and further well conducted trials in clearly defined patient groups are needed to progress in the management of this chronic and complex inflammatory disease...|$|R

50|$|Nonallergic {{rhinitis}} {{refers to}} rhinitis {{that is not}} due to an allergy. The category was formerly referred to as <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis,</b> as the first cause discovered was vasodilation due to an overactive parasympathetic nerve response.

40|$|CONCLUSION: This study {{demonstrates}} that, in {{the nasal}} respiratory mucosa {{of patients with}} <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis,</b> oxidative stress following peroxynitrite formation is confined to the respiratory epithelium. This suggests {{that the role of}} peroxynitrite in <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> differs from its role in other diseases of the respiratory tract. The results of this study also support the concept that different pathogenetic mechanisms are probably involved in <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis.</b> OBJECTIVE: Previous studies indicated that nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the pathogenesis of <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis,</b> strong expression of NO synthase being detected in the smooth muscle cells of the cavernous sinuses and in the respiratory epithelium. However, most adverse effects of high levels of NO originate from the reaction of NO with superoxide anions to form peroxynitrite. Therefore, in this study we evaluated the involvement of peroxynitrite in the pathogenesis of <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sites of peroxynitrite formation were identified by immunolabelling for 3 -nitrotyrosine (3 NT), its footprint in tissues. Samples of nasal mucosa were obtained from <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> patients and from control subjects who had undergone corrective surgery of the nasal septum. All samples were obtained by reduction of the inferior turbinate. RESULTS: Examination of specimens from <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> patients revealed that 3 NT is absent in epithelium with a normal appearance, cells of the subepithelial connective tissue, the glands and the blood vessels, including the cavernous sinuses. In contrast, intense 3 NT immunolabelling was found in the disrupted respiratory epithelium. 3 NT was not present in any of the specimens from control subjects...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{pathogenesis}} of <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> is not under-stood. It {{is unlikely}} that antihistamines, based on their H 1 antagonist activity alone, would be effective in this disorder. Methods: Nonetheless, at least one double-blind, placebo-con-trolled multicenter trial has found that intranasal azelastine relieves symptoms of this disorder better than placebo. The mechanism responsible for its beneficial effect in nonallergic rhinitis is unclear but probably relates to “anti-inflammatory/antiallergic ” activities. Results: Such mechanisms have been demonstrated {{for a number of}} different oral antihistamines, but often the concentrations required in vitro are higher than those that are normally achieved in vivo using recommended dosing. It has been postulated that intranasal administration, which can achieve high local levels, might be a factor responsible for enhancing the “anti-inflamma-tory/antiallergic ” properties. Conclusions: Interpreting this information allows one to conclude that antihistamines may be potentially effective agents in <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis,</b> {{and are more likely to}} be so when administered intranasally, despite the fact that data documenting this beneficial effect are sparse.

METHODS: A total of nine patients with symptoms of <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> underwent 14 endoscopic vidian neurectomies between 1998 and 2001. All patients had negative screening for allergies on their serum or on skin-prick tests. The surgical technique for endoscopic vidian neurectomy is presented. The outcomes for the patients were retrospectively assessed with patients asked to score their pre- and postoperative symptoms rating these symptoms on a scale of 1 - 10 after a mean follow-up of 25 months (range, 21 - 36 months). RESULTS: On this retrospective analysis there was a significant improvement in the symptoms of rhinorrhea (p = 0. 018) and nasal obstruction (p = 0. 011).

40|$|Conclusions Sphenopalatine artery {{ligation}} relieves {{symptoms of}} rhinorrhea, sneezing and nasal itching {{in patients with}} <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> associated with nasal polyps. Objectives. Nasal polyps often arise in a setting of <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis.</b> Responsible for the accompanying symptoms of rhinorrhea, sneezing and nasal itching are dysfunctions in nerve fiber activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Sphenopalatine pedicle resection with autonomic denervation could potentially reduce related symptoms. Methods In a prospective, double-blind setting, 60 patients with <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> and bilateral nasal polyps randomly assigned to functional endoscopic surgery either with (Group A) or without sphenopalatine artery ligation (Group B) completed a 3 -year follow-up. Pre-operative and post-operative (at 1 and 3 years) evaluations included symptom score, fiberendoscopy, and active anterior rhinomanometry. Results. In both treatment groups nasal breathing had improved at 1 -year and 3 -year follow-up (P< 0. 001), whereas a improvement in rhinorrhea (P< 0. 001), sneezing and itching (P< 0. 01) was attained only in group A. The inter-group comparison showed that a statistically significant improvement in rhinorrhea and nasal itching (P= 0. 002) and in sneezing (P< 0. 001) was present in Group A at both follow-up controls.

40|$|Topical {{treatment}} of allergic or <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> is possible {{by means of}} pressurized metered dose inhalers, aqueous spray, or dry powder inhalers. In children, {{little is known about}} nasal drug delivery by dry powder inhalation. The airflow through the device is critical for the drug release and a sufficient nasal inspiratory flow is needed for intranasal drug delivery from a dry powder inhaler. In order to investigate from what age children with allergic or <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> can reliably use such a device, device-dependent nasal peak inspiratory flow (DnPIF) was measured. The maximal DnPIF was measured in children aged 4 - 13 years making use of a dry powder inhaler (Turbuhaler(R)) connected to a spirometer (Vitalograph(R)). In the clinically relevant context, instructions from the doctor and one week's use of a Turbuhaler at home were found to be sufficient to obtain a good inhalation technique and were shown to improve DnPIF at least as effectively as visual feedback training at the clinic. Children with rhinitis, as well as healthy children from the age of 6 years, were able to generate a DnPIF sufficient to obtain a reliable nasal delivery of a dry powder drug dose. DnPIF values correlated with age. Consequently, a recommendation to use a nasal Turbuhaler from the age of 6 for topical drug delivery in the {{treatment of}} allergic or <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> seems reasonable...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundThere {{has been}} an {{increasing}} interest in monitoring the fractional concentrations of exhaled NO (FeNO) levels in allergic rhinitis (AR) patients. In the present study, we examined whether the nasal FeNO measurement might reflect the degree of local allergic inflammation as well as subjective symptoms. MethodsThe FeNO measurement was performed using a handheld electrochemical analyzer (NObreath®) with a nose adaptor. In the cross-sectional study, 56 patients with perennial AR patients, 18 AR patients with bronchial asthma (BA), 12 patients with <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis,</b> and 30 normal subjects were enrolled. For the follow-up study, 12 seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) patients against Japanese cedar and 10 perennial AR patients who underwent laser surgery were examined. ResultsThe AR patients and <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> patients showed significantly higher oral FeNO levels {{as compared with the}} normal subjects. The nasal FeNO levels were significantly higher in the perennial AR patients with or without BA than in the normal subjects and <b>vasomotor</b> <b>rhinitis</b> patients. There were positive correlations between the nasal symptom scores and FeNO levels. The SAR patients showed a significant decrease in the nasal FeNO level after the pollen dispersion season. In addition, the therapeutic effects of laser surgery in the AR patients accompanied a significant reduction in the nasal FeNO levels one month after treatment. ConclusionsThe nasal FeNO measurement by NObreath® is easy to perform and suitable for monitoring AR patients in various treatment modalities.
