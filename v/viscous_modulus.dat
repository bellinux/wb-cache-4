25|$|Methylcellulose (MC) is a {{material}} with well-defined sol-gel transitions in the optimal range of temperatures. MC gelation occurs {{because of an}} increase in intra- and inter-molecular hydrophobic interactions as the temperature increases. The sol-gel transition is governed by the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), which is the temperature at which the elastic modulus equals the <b>viscous</b> <b>modulus.</b> The LCST must not exceed physiological temperature (37°C) if the scaffold is to gel upon implantation, creating a minimally invasive delivery. Following implantation into a TBI lesion cavity or peripheral nerve guidance conduit, MC elicits a minimal inflammatory response. It is also very important for minimally invasive delivery that the MC solution has a viscosity at temperatures below its LCST, which allows it to be injected through a small gauge needle for implantation in in vivo applications. MC has been successfully used as a delivery agent for intra-optical and oral pharmaceutical therapies. Some disadvantages of MC include its limited propensity for protein adsorption and neuronal cellular adhesion making it a non-bioactive hydrogel. Due to these disadvantages, use of MC in neural tissue regeneration requires attaching a biologically active group onto the polymer backbone in order to enhance cell adhesion.|$|E

The moisture absorption rate of HPMC in PG:GF solvent mixtures in a 94 % relative humidified environment was also studied. A linear relationship between the elastic modulus or <b>viscous</b> <b>modulus</b> and polymer concentration was observed for the HPMC samples. The relative mucociliary transport rate tested on the non-depleted frog palate model revealed a curvilinear correlation with the loss tangent (a ratio of the <b>viscous</b> <b>modulus</b> to the elastic modulus) of the polymeric solution. Using GF as a solvent for HPMC resulted in a formation of a rigid gel with the highest elastic modulus and <b>viscous</b> <b>modulus</b> among solvents selected. A higher affinity for water was found for HPMC in the PG:GF 90 : 10 mixture compared with HPMC in the PG:GF 70 : 30 mixture.

The study has focused on a method for calculating λk, and the ηk using generalized Maxwell model (GMM) over a limited range of frequency and temperature.

The stable zone (or steady state region) which is suitable for measuring the rheological material functions was obtained from time sweep test results at various temperatures and frequencies. Stress sweep test was then carried out to determine linear viscoelastic zone of the com-pound at a given temperature and frequency. The critical stress, which determines the lin-ear-nonlinear transition point, was obtained from stress sweep test results at each tem-perature and frequency. The complex shear viscosity (η*), elastic shear <b>modulus</b> (G’), and <b>viscous</b> shear <b>modulus</b> (G”) were measured in frequency sweep test and the relax-ation time was then calculated.

40|$|Viscoelasticity of {{the leading}} edge, i. e., the lamellipodium, of a cell is the key {{property}} for {{a deeper understanding of}} the active extension of a cell's leading edge. The fact that the lamellipodium of a cell is very thin (1 kPa) on thin samples. We present the method for an atomic force microscopy-based microrheology that allows us to fully quantify the viscoelastic constants (elastic storage <b>modulus,</b> <b>viscous</b> loss <b>modulus,</b> and the Poisson ratio) of thin areas of a cell (< 1000 nm) as well as those of thick areas. We account for substrate effects by applying two different models—a model for well-adhered regions (Chen model) and a model for nonadhered regions (Tu model). This method also provides detailed information about the adhered regions of a cell. The very thin regions relatively near the edge of NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts can be identified by the Chen model as strongly adherent with an elastic strength of ∼ 1. 6 ± 0. 2 kPa and with an experimentally determined Poisson ratio of ∼ 0. 4 to 0. 5. Further from the edge of these cells, the adherence decreases, and the Tu model is effective in evaluating its elastic strength (∼ 0. 6 ± 0. 1 kPa). Thus, our AFM-based microrheology allows us to correlate two key parameters of cell motility by relating elastic strength and the Poisson ratio to the adhesive state of a cell. This frequency-dependent measurement allows for the decomposition of the elastic modulus into loss and storage modulus. Applying this decomposition and Tu's and Chen's finite depth models allow us to obtain viscoelastic signatures in a frequency range from 50 to 300 Hz, showing a rubber plateau-like behavior. ...|$|R

Polymer chains are modeled as a coarse-grained bead-spring system. Functionalized end groups, {{at both ends}} of the polymer chains, can form reversible bonds according to MC rules. Stress-strain curves show nonlinearities indicated by a non-ellipsoidal shape. We consider two types of nonlinearities. Type I occurs at a strain amplitude much larger than one, type II at a frequency at which the elastic storage <b>modulus</b> dominates the <b>viscous</b> loss <b>modulus.</b> In this last case, the network topology resembles that of the system at rest. The reversible bonds are broken and chains stretch when the system moves away from the zero-strain position. For type I, the chains relax and the number of reversible bonds peaks when the system is near an extreme of the motion. During the movement to the other extreme of the cycle, first a stress overshoot occurs, then a yield accompanied by shear-banding. Finally, the network restructures.

40|$|To {{determine}} the specific contribution of cytoskeletal proteins to cellular viscoelasticity we performed rheological experiments with Dictyostelium discoideum wild-type cells (AX 2) and mutant cells altered by homologous recombination to lack alpha-actinin (AHR), the ABP 120 gelation factor (GHR), {{or both of}} these F-actin cross-linking proteins (AGHR). Oscillatory and steady flow measurements of Dictyostelium wild-type cells in a torsion pendulum showed {{that there is a}} large elastic component to the viscoelasticity of the cell pellet. Quantitative rheological measurements were performed with an electronic plate-and-cone rheometer, which allowed determination of G', the storage shear modulus, and G", the <b>viscous</b> loss <b>modulus,</b> as a function of time, frequency, and strain, respectively. Whole cell viscoelasticity depends strongly on all three parameters, and comparison of wild-type and mutant strains under identical conditions generally produced significant differences. Especially stress relaxation experiments consistently revealed a clear difference between cells that lacked alpha-actinin as compared with wild-type cells or transformants without ABP 120 gelation factor, indicating that alpha-actinin {{plays an important role in}} cell elasticity. Direct observation of cells undergoing shear deformation was done by incorporating a small number of AX 2 cells expressing the green fluorescent protein of Aequorea victoria and visualizing the strained cell pellet by fluorescence and phase contrast microscopy.

40|$|PURPOSE. For {{development}} of a finite element analysis model of orbital mechanics, {{it was necessary to}} determine the material properties of orbital fat and its degree of deformation in eye rotation. METHODS. Elasticity and viscosity of orbital fat of eight orbits of four calves and two orbits of one rhesus monkey were measured with a parallel-plate rheometer. The degree of deformation of orbital fat was studied in two human subjects by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) through the optic nerve in seven (first subject) or fourteen positions of gaze from left to right. Bifurcations of veins in the fat were used as markers for displacement of the fat. RESULTS. The elastic shear modulus (G′) of calf orbital fat was between 250 Pa and 500 Pa, and of monkey orbital fat it was between 500 Pa and 900 Pa. The <b>viscous</b> shear <b>modulus</b> (G″) of calf orbital fat was between 80 Pa and 150 Pa, and for monkey orbital fat it was between 300 Pa and 500 Pa. In the MRI scans, it was found that markers in the fat, 1 to 5 mm posterior to the sclera, rotated with the eye for 36 % to 53 % of eye rotation; the remainder was accounted for by sliding of the eye within the Tenon capsule and within the orbital fat. CONCLUSIONS. Elastic and viscous shear moduli of orbital fat are low. Little energy is dissipated in the fat. The required deformation of the fat during eye rotation is limited because the eye slides, to some extent, within the Tenon capsule. Copyrigh...|$|R

Shear stress versus shear rate flow curves were measured under shear and stress control, for different micellar solutions with different composition, brine concentration, and temperature, showing a nonlinear behavior. Flow curves present two branches, one corresponding to high viscous fluid and another to low viscous fluid, separated by a stress plateau. We were able to develop a master dynamic phase diagram, which summarizes the nonlinear behavior by appropriately reducing the rheological variables.

40|$|Gluing of {{wood with}} great {{moisture}} content has challenge of water interaction with glue to give unwanted changes in glue properties and formed bond-line. Rheological measurements of polyurethane glues are sufficiently effective method {{to understand the}} polymer curing process and viscoelastic properties. Gel formation point is important parameter for a glue {{from the point of}} its application. When glue reaches the gel formation point, its viscosity drastically increases so that it could not properly wet the wood and it can result in poor bonds. One-component moisture curing polyurethane glues require water molecules for the polyadditional reaction. When water is involved in the curing reaction, it reacts with the isocyanate groups of glue and can lead to the formation of excessive carbon dioxide and thus can lead to glue penetration out of bond-line, additional backpressure. The dynamic viscoelastic parameters such as complex dynamic viscosity (ή), phase angle (δ), elastic storage <b>modulus</b> (G”), the <b>viscous</b> loss <b>modulus</b> (G”) of two kinds of polyurethane glues depending on added water amount (from 0. 9 % to 10. 0 %) at a constant frequency and deformation (oscillation mode) were determined using rheometer.

Preparation of acid solution with sea water showed negligible effect at higher concentrations of HCl (> 10 wt% HCl) whereas at lower concentrations of HCl the elastic modulus fell sharply. For spent acid solutions, the elastic modulus at room temperature was quite low. Increase in temperature resulted in the increase in elastic modulus up to 130 F after which it decreased.

40|$|Solutions {{containing}} a polyoxy-ethylene/polyoxy-propylene/polyoxy-ethylene (PEO-PPO-PEO) block copolymer, indicated as F 68, in water were investigated {{as a function}} of composition and temperature. Hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (H- 1 NMR) line width, chemical shift, self-diffusion, spin-lattice relaxation times, laser light scattering and rheological methods were used. The monomer-micelle equilibrium and the micelle-liquid crystalline phase transitions depend on the F 68 content in the mixture and temperature. Significant changes in light scattering intensity and apparent hydrodynamic radius are associated to micelle formation above the critical micellar temperature (CMT). According to a Contin analysis, this behaviour is reflected in the presence of two populations in the intensity-intensity autocorrelation functions. The contributions due to molecules and micelles can be evaluated separately. No such effects are observed below the CMT. Micelle onset is also associated to variations in H- 1 NMR spectra, affecting the chemical shift, line width and spin-lattice relaxation time of the PPO methyl protons and self-diffusion, as well. Spin-lattice relaxation times of PEO chains, conversely, change significantly at temperatures close to the micelle-liquid crystalline thermal transition.

Greater bread volume and less firmness were observed when a slow freezing rate (-. 14 °C/min) was employed...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{investigated}} the influence of heat treatment of lupin-based (LB) milk alternatives and different exopolysaccharide (EPS) -producing lactic acid bacteria on the physical characteristics of set-type LB yogurt alternatives. LB milk alternatives, obtained from protein isolate of Lupinus angustifolius cv. Boregine, were either pasteurized at 80 degrees C for 60 s or ultra-high temperature (UHT) heated at 140 degrees C for 10 s and was fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum TMW 1. 460 and 1. 1468, Pediococcus pentosaceus BGT B 34 and Lactobacillus brevis BGT L 150. Fermentation duration was strongly affected by heat treatment: different strains needed between 25 to 35 h in UHT LB milk alternative to reach a pH of 4. 5 compared to 14 to 24 h in pasteurized LB milk alternative. EPS extraction revealed slightly higher amounts of EPS for UHT LB yogurt alternatives (similar to 0. 5 - 0. 9 g/I: pasteurized: similar to 0. 4 - 0. 7 g/l). The more intensive heat treatment (UHT) resulted also in better rheological (apparent viscosity, hysteresis loop area, flow point, elastic, <b>viscous</b> and complex <b>modulus)</b> and textural properties (firmness, consistency, cohesiveness and index of viscosity) of the investigated LB yogurt alternatives. Furthermore, LB yogurt alternatives out of UHT milk alternative revealed a lower tendency to syneresis, measured with siphon and centrifugation method. This work contributes to the fundamental knowledge of the textural properties of LB yogurt alternatives...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This review summarises the way {{in which}} {{mechanical}} property measurements combined with clinical perception have influenced the last half century of materials evolution in contact lens development. Methods: Literature concerning the use of. in-vitro testing in assessment of the mechanical behaviour of contact lenses, and the mutual deformation of the lens material and ocular tissue was examined. Tensile measurements of historic and available hydrogel lenses have been collected, in addition to manufacturer-generated figures for the moduli of commercial silicone hydrogel lenses. Results: The three conventional modes of mechanical property testing; compression, tension and shear each represent different perspective in understanding the mutual interaction of the cornea and the contact lens. Tensile testing provides a measure of modulus, together with tensile strength and elongation to break, which all relate to handling and durability. Studies under compression also measure modulus and in particular indicate elastic response to eyelid load. Studies under shear conditions enable dynamic mechanical behaviour of the material to be assessed and the elastic and <b>viscous</b> components of <b>modulus</b> to be determined. These different methods of measurement have contributed to the interpretation of lens behaviour in the ocular environment. An amalgamated frequency distribution of tensile moduli for historic and currently available contact lens materials reveals the modal range to be 0. 3 - 0. 6. MPa. Conclusion: Mechanical property measurements of lens materials have enabled calibration of an important aspect of their ocular interaction. This together with clinical feedback has influenced development of new lens materials and assisted clinical rationalisation of in-eye behaviour of different lenses...|$|R
40|$|In Tissue Engineering (TE) applications, it is {{important}} to consider the mechanical properties that are being presented to the cells. Previous studies have shown that variations in substrate compressive modulus (rigidity) can affect a range of cell behaviours including cell spreading, motility, proliferation and differentiation. While these studies focused primarily on the dominant elastic component of a substrate, most matrices surrounding cells in vivo are viscoelastic in nature – that is, they have separable elastic (storage, G`) and <b>viscous</b> (loss, G``) <b>modulus</b> components. This thesis aims to isolate and analyse the effect of the viscous component (i. e. loss modulus) of a substrate on cell behaviour. It was hypothesised that a time dependent dissipation of energy after an initial matrix deformation (or dynamic creep) imposed by cells would influence cell behaviour. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were utilised for the analysis as they have great potential as a cell source in regenerative medicine due to their capacity to self-renew and differentiate towards multiple lineages. Polyacrylamide (PAM), due to its easily tunable properties, was used to develop a platform with which to study the effect of substrate loss modulus on hMSC behaviour. By varying the initial monomer concentrations of bis and acrylamide, a series of gels were produced with a constant storage modulus (G` ~ 4. 7 kPa, representing a constant compressive modulus of ~ 13. 5 kPa) but varying loss moduli over two orders of magnitude (1 - 130 Pa). This platform was then used to test the effect of loss modulus on hMSC behaviours. As substrate loss modulus increased, cell spread area, rate of membrane protrusion, motility and proliferation all increased but the size of focal adhesions decreased. Consistent with the cellular tensegrity model, it was hypothesised that much of the cell behaviour displayed on the high loss modulus (HLM) substrates related to the loss of cytoskeletal tension caused by the inherent creep of the substrates. Inhibitors were used to selectively impair isometric tension (using the non-muscle myosin II inhibitor, Blebbistatin) or both isometric and isotonic tension (using the Rho-Kinase inhibitor, Y- 27632). Blebbistatin treated hMSCs on low loss modulus (LLM) substrates exhibited behaviour similar to untreated hMSCs on HLM substrates. Furthermore, Blebbistatin treatment did not affect the behaviour of hMCSs on the HLM substrates while Y- 27632 had a substantiative effect. This indicated that isotonic tension plays an important role in directing the behaviour of hMSCs on HLM substrates and suggests that any further reduction in isometric tension on these substrates is limited. The effect of dynamic substrate creep on hMSC differentiation was also analysed. While variations in substrate loss modulus did not cause spontaneous differentiation towards osteogenic or adipogenic lineages, hMSCs on HLM substrates showed significantly enhanced differentiation towards both lineages in the presences of soluble induction cues. Furthermore, hMSCs on HLM substrates showed no bias towards either adipogenic or osteogenic lineages when cultured in medium with mixed inductive cues. This demonstrates that rather than directing hMSC differentiation, increasing substrate loss modulus acts to enhance the differentiation induced by soluble cues. The adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs exposed to Blebbistatin and Y- 27632 on the different gels once again indicated that the effect of substrate loss modulus on hMSC behaviour was due to a loss in cytoskeletal tension. Previous studies have shown that the differentiation of hMSCs towards smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is enhanced by increased cell spread area. Given the increased cell spread area on HLM substrates, the effect of substrate loss modulus on SMC differentiation of hMSCs was analysed. Increasing substrate loss modulus was shown to enhance the expression of SMC specific markers within hMSCs in both basal and myogenic media. It was suggested that the increased potential for SMC differentiation on the HLM substrates was due, in part, to the observed increase in expressions of proteins known to promote SMC differentiation. N-Cadherin (N-Cad) expression (which is known to mediate SMC differentiation) was also increased in hMSCs on HLM substrates. It was hypothesised that this would facilitate enhanced SMC differentiation on HLM substrates, in addition to a probable increase in Rac 1 activity (which is known to mediate SMC differentiation and N-Cad expression). In basal medium, inhibition of Rac 1 activity (via the Rac 1 inhibitor, NSC 23766) reduced N-Cad and SMC marker expressions by hMSCs on HLM substrates to levels equivalent to those of untreated hMSCs on LLM substrates. This indicated that increased N-Cad on HLM substrates was due to increased Rac 1 activity, which was supported by the observed translocation of Tiam 1 (a guanine exchange factor responsible for Rac 1 activation) from the nucleus to the periphery of hMSCs on these substrates. In contrast to basal medium, inhibition of Rac 1 activity in hMSCs on HLM substrates in myogenic medium did not result in a decrease of N-Cad expression (unlike those on LLM substrates) suggesting a complex interplay between soluble and mechanical directive cues. Finally, as the majority of previous studies into the effect of substrate mechanical properties on cell behaviour have focused upon substrate rigidity, the effect of substrate rigidity was compared to the effect of substrate loss modulus on SMC differentiation of hMSCs. The enhanced differentiation caused by increasing substrate loss modulus on enhancing SMC differentiation was maintained when the compressive moduli of gels were varied and furthermore, substrate loss modulus was shown to have a greater effect on SMC differentiation than substrate compressive modulus. In these studies we have developed a platform for testing the effect of substrate loss modulus on cell behaviour and shown that it has a significant impact on the behaviour and phenotype of hMSCs. While previous studies into the effect of substrate mechanical properties on cell behaviour have focused primarily on substrate compressive modulus, this thesis highlights the importance of considering the effect of other mechanical properties, namely loss modulus and creep. It is hoped that the information presented here can be used in the future optimisation of biomaterial scaffolds for TE applications, such as those involving blood vessel regeneration...|$|R
