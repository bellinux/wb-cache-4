5|$|After a {{telephone}} discussion with a Casper weather briefer, Reid {{decided to take}} off despite the worsening conditions at the airport, {{and to try to}} escape the poor weather by turning immediately eastward. He decided to file a visual flight rules (<b>VFR)</b> <b>flight</b> plan, and depart under VFR, to be better able to cope with the heavy weather in his immediate takeoff path and the vicinity of the airport.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{aerodromes}} that support GA in the UK {{is difficult to}} establish with certainty. Pooleys 2008 United Kingdom Flight Guide lists 355, and the Airplan Flight Equipment UK <b>VFR</b> <b>Flight</b> Guide 2008 lists nearly 500. Lockyears Farm 'Strips' and Private Airfields Flight Guide lists more than 300 landing sites. The GASAR study estimates 1,100 formal flying sites in England alone, a figure which includes 400 sites known to planning authorities but not included in flight guides. It estimates another 759 informal sites known only to land owners, customs, {{and members of the}} enthusiast group Air-Britain.|$|E
25|$|The Europa is {{classified}} as a homebuilt in its home country of the UK and qualifies for a Permit to Fly. This limits it to day and <b>VFR</b> <b>flight.</b> Previous restrictions of flying over built up areas were removed during 2008. In Canada the Europa is an amateur-built aircraft and qualifies for a Special Certificate of Airworthiness.|$|E
50|$|Class C {{airspace}} {{is defined}} below 8100 m and allows IFR and VFR operations. Both IFR and VFR operations {{are required to}} have permanent two-way radio contact with ATC. IFR flights are separated {{from each other and}} from <b>VFR</b> <b>flights.</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> are separated from IFR flights and are provided traffic information about other <b>VFR</b> <b>flights.</b> Permission for using airspace is required except for the special cases listed in clause 114 of the Federal rules for using Russian air space.|$|R

25|$|On 3 February 2007, a Piper PA-28 Cherokee {{registered}} G-BBBK was {{inbound to}} Blackpool when it crashed on the Fylde Coast. The <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> had originated from Exeter Airport {{and the pilot}} was attempting to land in thick fog. He failed to locate the airport and continued several miles north before losing altitude and crashing in shallow water between the central and southern piers. Both occupants were killed.|$|E
25|$|Brazilian {{investigation}} team CENIPA {{was involved}} in the investigation and conducted a 12-month-long investigation into the crash. The final report was released on 19 March 2007, concluding that the crash was categorized as Controlled Flight Into Terrain and was caused by pilot error. The condition of the weather in the area at the time was bad, and it was impossible to make a <b>VFR</b> <b>flight,</b> according to CENIPA. However, the crew of Flight 6865 intentionally changed from IFR to VFR while the visibility was limited. Before the flight, the crew didn't know the weather ahead of them. CENIPA also blamed the crew's poor decision-making, stating that there was inadequate assessment which caused them to fly at a lower altitude than a safe limit.|$|E
25|$|On August 4, 1968, a Convair CV-580, flying as North Central Airlines flight 261, {{collided}} {{in mid-air}} with a privately owned Cessna 150. The Cessna cabin remained {{attached to the}} Convair's forward baggage compartment. The Convair made a safe emergency landing at Milwaukee. The three Cessna occupants were killed. The Cessna was on a <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> from Lombard, Illinois to Sheboygan County Memorial Airport in Sheboygan Falls. It was determined that {{the inability of the}} Convair 580 flight crew to detect the Cessna 150 visually in sufficient time to take evasive action, despite having been provided with three radar traffic advisories, caused the crash. Visual detection capabilities were reduced by the heavy accumulation of insect smears on the windows of the Convair. Visibility was further reduced by haze, smoke and sunglare, and by the inconspicuous colour and lack of relative motion of the Cessna.|$|E

500|$|As the {{aircraft}} began taxiing to the departure runway, the rain intensified and visibility {{at the airport}} fell below the three mile minimum required for <b>VFR</b> <b>flight.</b> Cheyenne's control tower advised the Cessna about the reduced visibility and that the [...] "field is IFR". [...] In general, when an airport is officially IFR (normally because of reduced visibility or low cloud ceiling), only IFR or special VFR operations are allowed. Reid then requested and received from the control tower a special VFR clearance {{to allow him to}} exit the airport's control zone visually, despite the reduced visibility.|$|E
500|$|The team's {{goal was}} to create the [...] "best, most {{realistic}} civilian flight simulator", which would provide an immersive world for the player. Radio communications between ATCs, AI planes and the player occur in real-time: a [...] "sophisticated audio splicing system" [...] gathers pre-recorded voice fragments into contextually appropriate sentences. The team recorded the engine noise {{of each of the}} game's planes, and they designed cockpits more interactive than those in Flight Unlimited. Roughly 300 times more terrain area was included in Flight Unlimited II than in its predecessor. To generate the terrain, the team combined digital elevation maps with satellite imagery rendered at four square meters per pixel. The images were taken at 9:30am, because the long shadows provided an illusion of depth. 3D models were used for all buildings taller than nine stories. Because of the terrain detail, the game was the first to allow players to follow VFR. Initially, the team planned to include only <b>VFR</b> <b>flight,</b> but they later enabled IFR to [...] "ease navigation". The team hoped to add more terrain and planes and a multiplayer feature after the game's release.|$|E

2500|$|Pilot Hughes later {{made contact}} with Dyersburg Regional Airport in Dyersburg, Tennessee, and landed there at 5:05pm, where he {{requested}} a weather briefing {{for the remainder of}} the flight to Nashville. He was informed by Federal Aviation Administration employee Leroy Neal that local conditions were marginal for <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> and weather at the destination airport was below VFR minimums. Hughes then asked if the Dyersburg airport runways were lighted at night in case he had to return and Neal replied that they were. The pilot then informed Neal he would fly east towards the Tennessee River and navigate to Nashville from there, as he was familiar with the terrain in that area. Hughes expressed concern with a [...] high television transmitting tower north of Nashville, then stated that he would attempt the flight and return if the weather conditions worsened.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} the use of SVFR is when a flight wishes to leave an airport in a control zone, to fly VFR in {{uncontrolled}} airspace, when the visibility is below the minimum for <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> in the control zone but not below the lower minimum for <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> in uncontrolled airspace. SVFR is never offered by Air Traffic Control. It must be requested by the Pilot in Command.|$|E
50|$|Flights must be {{conducted}} according to Visual Flight Rules (i.e. {{in sight of}} the ground and away from cloud). This includes both controlled and uncontrolled airspace.
