40|$|OBJECTIVE - To assess {{mortality}} and the psychological repercussions of the prolonged waiting time for candidates for heart surgery. METHODS - From July 1999 to May 2000, using a standardized questionnaire, we carried out standardized interviews and semi-structured psychological interviews with 484 patients with coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> 121 patients with <b>valvular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases,</b> and 100 patients with congenital <b>heart</b> <b>diseases.</b> RESULTS - The coefficients of mortality (deaths per 100 patients/year) were as follows: patients with coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> 5. 6; patients with <b>valvular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases,</b> 12. 8; and patients with congenital <b>heart</b> <b>diseases,</b> 3. 1 (p< 0. 0001). The survival curve was lower {{in patients with}} <b>valvular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> than in patients with coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> and congenital <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> (p< 0. 001). The accumulated probability of not undergoing surgery was higher in patients with <b>valvular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> than in the other patients (p< 0. 001), and, among the patients with <b>valvular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases,</b> this probability was higher in females than in males (p< 0. 01). Several patients experienced intense anxiety and attributed their adaptive problems in the scope of love, professional, and social lives, to not undergoing surgery. CONCLUSION - Mortality was high, and even higher among the patients with <b>valvular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases,</b> with negative psychological and social repercussions...|$|R

25|$|High blood {{pressure}} and <b>valvular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> {{are the most common}} alterable risk factors for AF. Other heart-related risk factors include heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart disease.

Other factors include excess alcohol intake, diabetes mellitus, and thyrotoxicosis. However, half of cases are not associated with any of these risks.

25|$|Common {{causes of}} heart failure include {{coronary}} artery disease including a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack), high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, <b>valvular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> excess alcohol use, infection, and cardiomyopathy of an unknown cause.

There are two main types {{of heart failure}}: heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure with normal ejection fraction depending on whether the ability of the left ventricle to contract is affected, or the heart's ability to relax. The severity of disease is usually graded by the degree of problems with exercise.

Once these marks are there , they never go away. In this case, there were no marks at all." [...] Although Teare observed that the right side of Hendrix's heart was widely dilated, he found no evidence of <b>valvular</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> He discovered a partially collapsed left lung and 400 ml of fluid in Hendrix's chest. Both lungs were congested, and vomit was found in the smaller bronchi. According to Teare, Hendrix's stomach [...] "contained a medium-sized partially digested meal in which rice could be distinguished." [...] Teare concluded that Hendrix's kidneys were healthy, and his liver was congested. His [...] "bladder was half full of clear urine." [...] He stated that Hendrix's blood alcohol content was 100mg per 100 ml, [...] "enough to fail a breathalyzer test... the equivalent of about four pints of beer." [...] Teare reported that analysis of Hendrix's blood [...] "revealed a mixture of barbiturates consistent with those from Vesparax", and he estimated that drug concentrations translated to ingestion of 1.8 grams of barbiturate, 20mg of amphetamine, and 20mg of cannabis.
