40|$|Grapevine leafroll disease (GLRD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} virus diseases of grapevines around the country and the world. The disease reduces yields, delays fruit ripening, reduces soluble solids and can cause irregular or undesirable flavors. One response to minimize economic losses from GLRD, is the use of <b>virus-tested</b> grapevines. This study constructs a cost benefit analysis of using this material in California and New York. Benefits arise from the reduction in costs and increase in yield due to the reduction of disease prevalence from planting screened material and optimally managing the disease. <b>Virus-tested</b> material is available to nurseries and growers from grape centers including Foundation Plant Services in Davis, California and New York State Agriculture Experiment Station in Geneva, NY. Over the period 2006 - 2015 in California, estimated cumulative benefits by 2015 are $ 1. 51 billion (2002 dollars) and cumulative costs to operate Foundation Plant Services in Davis, CA, amount to $ 12. 9 million, a benefit to cost ratio of 117. Projecting over the next ten years, by 2025 cumulative net benefits (benefits-costs) will reach an estimated $ 3. 26 billion. Across the country in New York, benefits do not accrue until 2020 due to later adoption of <b>virus-tested</b> material. We estimate cumulative benefits reach $ 19. 5 million and funding from the National Clean Plant Network (NCPN) to operate the grape center in Geneva, NY totals $ 2. 7 million by 2025. Additionally, this thesis conducts a welfare analysis to determine the distribution of net benefits within California between grape producers and wine producers who purchase grapes to crush. The results suggest that grape growers receive most benefits because supply is inelastic relative to demand. These findings are valuable to understand the return of public and private investment in grape centers that produce <b>virus-tested</b> stocks for the industry, as well as help the industry understand the economic benefits of using the material, incentivizing stronger adoption...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Viral {{diseases}} affecting sweetpotato are {{the most}} devastating and cause up to 98 % yield loss. In this paper, we report, meristem culture, graft transmission and virus indexing for management of viral pathogens in seven elite sweetpotato cultivars. Plantlets were developed in vitro from the apical meristematic dome with one to two leaf primordia. Mericlones were grafted on virus-sensitive indicator plant Ipomoea setosa and no viral disease symptoms were seen on I. setosa leaves in most cases. This indicates that no viruses translocated from meristem-derived scions to the virus-sensitive root stock. On the other hand, most of the non-tested traditional planting material induced distinct disease symptoms upon grafting, which revealed the presence {{of one or more}} viruses in it. About 85 % of mericlones recovered from 0. 3 – 0. 5 mm size meristem were tested as virus free, whereas it is dif-ficult to culture meristems smaller than 0. 3 mm due to dissection damage and too small a size. <b>Virus-tested</b> mer-iclones were further micropropagated and transferred to the field. Only few plants were found to be diseased in the R 1 field trial. Root yield in the R 2 generation was increased significantly when compared with non-tested control plants. During field exposure, only a low percentage of healthy plants were found infected with viruses when managed in a net house. This implies that viral vectors were present during the growing season and reinfection could be effectively reduced by net house management. We concluded that this low-cost technique of producing <b>virus-tested</b> planting material would significantly boost the yield through efficient removal of yield-reducing pathogens...|$|E

30|$|Crumbly {{fruit is}} an {{indication}} of a partial failure in one or more physiological processes concerned with fruit development (Jennings 1967 b) and is an increasing problem for the European raspberry industry, with particular problems occurring in widely grown commercial cultivars Tulameen and Glen Ample.

Raspberry Bushy Dwarf Virus (RBDV) infects pollen, reducing its capacity to induce fruit-set and can lead to failure of almost half of all drupelets to set (Murant et al. 1974; Daubeny et al. 1978). A genetic cause has been demonstrated where the crumbly phenotype arises from <b>virus-tested</b> mother plants (Jennings 1988). Studies have also shown that extensive tissue culturing of plants may increase the emergence of the condition (N. Jennings pers comm.).

In March 1999, five survey teams visually inspected approximately 30, 000 banana mats at 20 villages and 10 commercial farms on the main island of Tutuila. Ten thousand mats were inspected on four other islands in the territory. The virus was present in all villages and farms surveyed on Tutuila. Average percent infection for 18 of the 20 villages was 3. 4 ± 1. 3 % and for the 10 farms, 5. 4 ± 3. 7 %. There was no apparent pattern of BBTV distribution. The small, offshore island of Aunu’u, had a 5. 3 % incidence of infection. No symptoms of BBTV were observed on the three islands of Ofu, Olosega and Ta’u, located 110 km east of Tutuila. Survey results were conservative, as only mats with moderate to severe symptoms of BBTV were considered diseased; more importantly, farmers tend to remove symptomatic plants and suckers {{as a means of}} disease control. The relatively low level of BBTV and its slow spread may indicate small populations or inactivity of the aphid vector, Pentalonia nigronervosa.

40|$|Grapevine leafroll disease {{threatens the}} {{economic}} sustainability of the grape and wine {{industry in the}} United States and around the world. This viral disease reduces yield, delays fruit ripening, and affects wine quality. Although there is new information on the disease spatial-dynamic diffusion, {{little is known about}} profit-maximizing control strategies. Using cellular automata, we model the disease spatial-dynamic diffusion for individual plants in a vineyard, evaluate nonspatial and spa-tial control strategies, and rank them based on vineyard expected net present values. Nonspatial strategies consist of roguing and replacing symptomatic grapevines. In spatial strategies, symp-tomatic vines are rogued and replaced, and their nonsymptomatic neighbors are <b>virus-tested,</b> then rogued and replaced if the test is positive. Both nonspatial and spatial classes of strategies are formulated and examined with and without considering vine age. We find that spatial strategies targeting immediate neighbors of symptomatic vines dominate nonspatial strategies, increasing the vineyard expected net present value by 18 % to 19 % relative to the strategy of no disease control. We also find that age-structured disease control is preferred to non-age-structured control but only for nonspatial strategies. Sensitivity analyses show that disease eradication is possible if either the disease transmission rate or the virus undetectability period is substantially reduced.

40|$|Open Access JournalYams are staples in West Africa. They are {{propagated}} from tubers in {{an informal}} seed system. This encourages a build-up of diseases, and necessitates the rapid development of a formal seed system where certified seeds are functional. Although few reports exist {{on the use of}} meristem culture to generate pathogen-free yam, the success rate for the most economically important species in the sub-region, Dioscorea rotundata, for the most prevalent viruses is inadequate. To generate pathogen-free yam planting materials, the relative efficiency of tissue culture and positive selection was compared. Twenty-one asymptomatic yam plants were positively selected from 8187 stands of five landraces. Five of these stands were tested virus-negative by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Yam mosaic virus (YMV), Yam mild mosaic virus (YMMV) and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), and by PCR for the genus Badnavirus (BV), giving 0. 08 % success. Single nodes of the positively selected stands were used to establish in vitro plantlets, which were screened onto bacteriological indexing medium. The same was done for meristem- and node-derived plantlets of the improved variety TDr 95 / 19158. Incidence of endophytes ranged from 18 to 32 % in the nodal plantlets while it was 0 % in the meristem-derived plantlets.

To address these challenges, the discovery and study of new sources of genetic resistance and adaptability are required, along with the general conservation of diversity. The Solomon Islands, located in the south-western Pacific region near Papua New Guinea, are a major center of banana diversity. Some collections had been made by nationals of some of the diversity present but little was known internationally of the rich genetic resource present. Two separate visits to the Solomon Islands characterized banana collections, documented and collected germplasm, recommended conservation strategies and provided training in cultivar characterization. A remarkable range of genetic diversity was found, including: many AA and AAA cooking types somewhat like those present in Papua New Guinea; nine Fei cultivars in relatively common usage, and two undescribed wild species as well as five AAB Pacific Plantains and four ABB cooking bananas belonging to the Kalapua subgroup. About six of the unique cultivars were successfully collected and established in the regional in vitro germplasm collection of SPC in Suva, Fiji. Nine Solomon Islanders were trained in the finer points of characterizing banana cultivars. Further collecting and study/evaluation of this rich diversity will promote its appreciation and potential utilization for meeting the challenges and opportunities ahead. Future studies could also determine the spread of the Awawe species and variability of morphological traits in the population. Community-based conservation could promote awareness of dietary diversity for better nutrition, via using the Fei bananas described in this paper.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that virus infections, often symptomless, {{significantly}} limit sweetpotato productivity, especially in regions characterized by low input agricultural systems. In sweetpotatoes, the successful emergence and development of lateral roots (LRs), the main determinant of root architecture, determines the competency of adventitious roots to undergo storage root initiation. This study aimed to investigate the effect of some plant viruses on root architecture attributes during the onset of storage root initiation in 'Beauregard' sweetpotatoes that were grown with or without the presence of nitrogen. In two replicate experiments, <b>virus-tested</b> plants consistently failed to show visible symptoms at 20 days regardless of nitrogen treatment. In both experiments, the severity of symptom development among infected plants ranged from 25 to 118 % when compared to the controls (virus tested plants grown in the presence of nitrogen). The presence of a complex of viruses (Sweet potato feathery mottle virus, Sweet potato virus G, Sweet potato virus C, and Sweet potato virus 2) was associated with 51 % reduction in adventitious root number among plants grown without nitrogen. The effect of virus treatments on first order LR development depended on {{the presence or absence of}} nitrogen. In the presence of nitrogen, only plants infected with Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus showed reductions in first order LR length, number, and density, which were decreased by 33 %, 12 %, and 11 %, respectively, when compared to the controls. In the absence of nitrogen, virus tested and infected plants manifested significant reductions for all first order LR attributes. These results provide evidence that virus infection directly influences sweetpotato yield potential by reducing both the number of adventitious roots and LR development. These findings provide a framework for understanding how virus infection reduces sweetpotato yield and could lead to the development of novel strategies to mitigate virus effects on sweetpotato productivity...|$|E

The following activities are in progress: (i) selection of individual trees in pre-selected groves; (ii) assessment of the sanitary status of field-selected accessions by laboratory tests; (iii) identification of AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) and SSR (Simple Sequence Repeats) markers suitable for the molecular characterization of selected genotypes; (iv) setting up efficient protocols for virus elimination; (v) obtention of "primary sources" (nuclear stocks) liable to enter certification programs. Due to the widespread occurrence of latent virus infections, visual inspections are unreliable, thus field observations need to be complemented by laboratory tests. Doublestranded RNA (dsRNA) analysis, RT-PCR, and molecular hybridisation were successfully used to test {{a large number of}} samples collected in commercial orchards. In order to characterize genotypes and establish their genetic relationships, olive accessions were screened with three AFLP primer combinations and twenty-seven SSR primer pairs. A comparison was done between AFLP and SSR marker variability, their efficiency and usefulness for establishing genetic relationships and cultivar identification. The data obtained were worked out with the Jaccard genetic similarity coefficient, applying the SAHN clustering method. The resulting dendrograms showed that all genotypes could be unequivocally distinguished. Because the sanitary status of very few of the selected plants conformed to legislative health requirements, most of the selected accessions underwent sanitation by in vitro meristem tip culture, in vivo and in vitro heat therapy, and rapid in vitro subculturing of shoots tips.

Tissue culture techniques of meristem culture combined with heat therapy {{have been used}} to produce high-yielding <b>virus-tested</b> plantlets of root crops, which are later multiplied through micropropagation. However, the micropropagation rate is low in yam. We investigated in vitro, the rate of production of new nodes at some Plant growth regulator regimes applied at specific growth phases of yam. Three concentrations each of uniconazole-p (UP), gibberellic, jasmonic (JA) and naphthalene acetic (NAA) acids were applied at single node and primary nodal complex (PNC) formation phases in a split-plot design using two genotypes each of white and water yams. Number of nodes per plantlet was recorded after 16 weeks. The number of new nodes varied significantly with genotype by growth phase interaction and the main effect of PGRs. After 16 weeks, the control, 1. 7 µM UP and 0. 03 µM JA had highest means of 7, 9 and 8 nodes per plantlet compared to 2 - 3 nodes in the GA treatments. Thus, 4, 900, 8, 100 and 6, 400 plantlets can be obtained in I year from a 100 -node plant. In D. alata genotypes, addition of PGRs at PNC doubled the number of nodes per plantlet relative to addition at single node stage, while the effect of stage varied with genotype in D. rotundata. There is an important role for GA and its inhibitor-UP on the rate of yam micropropagation. Optimum multiplication rates can be achieved if the right PGR is applied at a standardized growth phase of a particular genotype. Earliness of genotypes seems to be a major factor that will determine the timing of application of PGRs. Peer Revie...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses a}} family of agricultural and resource problems that emerge when biophysical and economic systems are endogenously linked over space and time. In particular, we study the spatial-dynamic bioeconomics of the grapevine leafroll disease (GLRD) which threatens the economic sustainability of the grape and wine industry. The first essay of the dissertation relies on a survey with vineyard managers in the Finger Lakes region of New York to assess the economic cost of the grapevine leafroll disease and identify optimal nonspatial disease control strategies under an array of bioeconomic parameters. The second essay employs cellular automata to model the disease spatial-dynamic diffusion for individual plants in a vineyard, evaluate nonspatial and spatial control strategies, and rank them based on vineyard expected net present values. Nonspatial strategies consist of removing and replacing symptomatic grapevines. In spatial strategies, symptomatic vines are removed and replaced, and their nonsymptomatic neighbors are <b>virus-tested,</b> then removed and replaced if the test is positive. We find that the nonspatial strategies currently recommended to the industry are not cost-effective under model baseline parameters. In contrast, we find that spatial strategies targeting immediate neighbors of symptomatic vines increase the vineyard expected net present value by 18 - 19 % relative to the strategy of no disease control. In the third essay, we model spatialdynamic, negative externalities generated by a plant-level disease diffusion process between two ecologically connected but independently managed, heterogonous vineyards. One vineyard produces high-value wine grapes whereas the other produces low-value wine grapes. We embed the computational model in a bargaining game between neighboring managers. We find that, under noncooperative management, it is optimal for neither manager to control the disease. Under cooperative management, we find it optimal for the high-value manager to spatially control the disease and to pay the low-value manager to do similarly. The cooperative solution increases total payoffs by 20 %. Using mean-preserving price expansions and contractions, we show that total payoff decreases with {{the magnitude of the}} price differential between the neighboring vineyards up to a point where cooperation becomes Pareto-optimal and the relationship between heterogeneity and total payoff becomes U-shaped. 2019 - 08 - 1...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Twenty Russet Burbank seed lots were {{collected}} from four states and one Canadian Province in 1988 and planted in replicated trails at Powell Butte and Hermiston, Oregon {{as part of a}} two year study to quantify clonal differences in the cultivar. Samples of each seed lot were concurrently increased and stored under identical conditions at Powell Butte to preclude physiological age differences in seed used for similar plantings in 1989. Non-genetic influences were further reduced in the second year (1989) planting by subjecting seed to a combination of eye-indexing and ELISA testing to eliminate virus infected tubers. It was postulated that any differences in yield and performance observed in 1989 would be primarily genetically related. Significant differences (p = 0. 05) were noted in U. S. No. 1 yields at both locations and in total yields at Powell Butte in 1988. Similar plantings in 1989 using standardized seed from the 1988 Powell Butte increase showed significant differences in U. S. No. 1 yields only at Hermiston. However, differences significant at the p = 0. 10 level were observed for both total and U. S. No. 1 yields, tuber size distribution, and tuber specific gravity during both years at Hermiston. The range in yields decreased with the use of standardized seed at Powell Butte as expected but increased at Hermiston. Reasons for these seemingly contradictory responses are unclear. If substantial differences in maturity existed among the seed lots/clones, the long growing season at Hermiston would have accentuated yield differences. The 1989 Hermiston season was 20 days longer than in 1988 and could have broadened yield ranges in 1989. It is possible that non-genetic factors such as physiological age and viral infection might have partially masked maturity effects at Hermiston in 1988. The Powell Butte growing season is too short to show strong yield benefits from delayed maturity. Consistent differences in seed lot performance in the absence of non-genetic influences such as seed tuber physiological age and viral content would suggest that useful clonal differences exist. Four seed lots in these studies consistently produced high yields at Powell Butte and three at Hermiston during both years while one produced high yields at both locations. Further, large yield differences were still evident at Hermiston in 1989 in trials planted with <b>virus-tested,</b> identically aged seed. These results suggest that line selection from these seed lots could produce high yielding Russet Burbank clones with good tuber conformation. Additional field trials are needed to fully characterize the nature and importance of these potential clonal differences...|$|E

In contrast, the spread rate of HpL V, HpMV, and PNRSV was consistently slower in 'Opal' gardens, and this {{was found to be}} the most field resistant cultivar to infection by all three viruses. PNRSV was detected by double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) in chronically infected ' Victoria' plants throughout the growing season. Testing of a range of tissues from 'Victoria' plants suggested a symmetrical distribution ofPNRSV within the plant. Similar testing of 'Nugget', 'Pride of Ringwood', and 'Opal' plants suggested an asymmetrical distribution of PNRSV within the plant. The longer period of elevated virus levels in all tissues in 'Victoria' may increase the probability of virus transmission and be responsible for the accelerated transmission of PNRSV in this cultivar. The asymmetric virus distribution in 'Nugget', 'Pride of Ringwood', and 'Opal' suggested that accurate virus testing relies upon sampling from several hines from each string. Spatial analysis of PNRSV epidemics by ordinary run and radial correlation analyses in 'Victoria' gardens in Myrtleford, Victoria and Bushy Park, Tasmania associated PNRSV transmission with mechanical mowing of basal growth. Transmission was reduced in field trials by preventing basal growth contact between infected and virus-free plants 5 along rows early in the season. This demonstrated that plant contact early in the season increases the probability of transmitting PNRSV to virus-free plants by decreasing the distance infective virions have to travel to infect new plants. Glasshouse trials also confirmed PNRSV to be transmitted by contact and simulated slashing between infected and virus-free plants. Root grafting was also successful at transmitting PNRSV between infected and virus-free plants. The presence of root grafts in Tasmanian hop gardens was suggested by injection of the translocatable herbicide marker, glyphosate. However, quantifi cation {{of the extent to which}} root grafts contribute to transmission of all three viruses requires further work. Spatial analysis of carl avirus epidemics showed different distributions between 'Victoria' gardens in Myrtleford and Bushy Park. Random distributions of both HpL V and HpMV at Myrtleford suggested transmission by alatae aphid vectors. Autocorrelated along row distributions of both viruses at Bushy Park suggested transmission by either mechanical transmission through basal growth mowing, and/or aphid vectors (alatae or apterous) directed along rows from basal growth bridges formed through basal growth mowing between rows. A significant positive association between HpLV and HpMV was consistently demonstrated in several cultivars. This may suggest transmission by common aphid vector species, transencapsidation, or the possibility that infection by one virus makes the plant more susceptible to infection by the other. 6 In most hop cultivars grown in Australia the slow rate of virus transmission and significant effect of some viruses on yield of cones and levels of brewing organic acids suggested the continued use of a virus certification scheme for planting stock is warranted. However, in 'Victoria', the usefulness of certification schemes is uncertain because of the rapid spread ofviruses in this cultivar and its tolerance to infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} in {{the field}} of the disease peach rosette and decline (PRD), which is of considerable economic importance in the Goulburn Valley, causing fruit loss and tree death, was shown to increase from 0. 9 to 91. 3 % in an orchard of cv. Golden Queen in 10 years. Similar results were found with the cv. Pullars Cling, in which infection increased from 1. 5 to 29. 7 % over five years. The pattern of spread was mainly from infected trees to contiguous uninfected trees. This is consistent with the view that the main causal agent, prune dwarf virus (PDV), is transmitted only via the transfer of infected pollen : a previous finding in cherries which was confirmed in peaches. Prunus necrotic ringspot virus (PNRV) is the other virus always present {{in the field}} in PRD-infected trees. The mode of spread of PNRV is also by pollen. Within the tree, PDV moved erratically from the first infected limb, via phloem but not xylem, into the other limbs well in advance of the appearance of symptoms. Three months after flowering, PDV was detected in 65 % of main limbs adjacent to the first infected limbs but in only 30 % of limbs more remotely positioned on the tree. However, removing infected limbs within four weeks of flowering, when the initial infection was presumed to have occurred, did not prevent the movement of PDV into the rest of the tree. Laterals from peach trees infected with PRD were tested for the presence of PDV, using woody virus indicators (cvs Golden Queen, Italian Prune and Elberta seedling). Golden Queen was found to be a more reliable indicator for detecting PDV than Italian prune, as the presence of PNRV with PDV killed 71 % of the Italian prune buds compared to only 34 % of the Golden Queen buds. Golden Queen also developed more obvious foliage symptoms of PDV infection than Elberta seedlings. The probability of failing to detect PDV in infected field trees, using all three indicator plants, was higher {{in the first year of}} infection. The rate of spread of PRD was reduced in the orchard by preventing infected trees from flowering, either by removing obviously infected trees or by deblossoming. Removing infected trees resulted in a three-fold reduction in the spread of the disease in two seasons. Removing the flowers from infected trees before pollination reduced the spread of the disease by about half. This, only partial, control of the spread of PRD by tree removal or deblossoming was attributed to the presence of up to 14. 3 % of trees without symptoms being latently infected with PDV. It was observed that deliberate infection with PDV by pollen also resulted in a slow expression of the symptoms of PRD. The effects of PRD on the growth of young peach trees was obvious in the first three months of growth. There were considerable varietal differences in the severity of this effect. Those varieties based on cvs. Golden Queen or Levis Cling were more severely affected than the variety Elberta. The results from shoot elongation measurements agreed with those obtained from conventional growth analysis methods. These latter experiments showed that, after three months, the dry weight and leaf area of infected Golden Queen plants were reduced by 94 %. The fruit yield from mature PRD-free trees was three times that of trees infected for the first season, even though symptoms were apparent only on one limb; and six times that from chronically affected trees infected for two seasons. The effect of virus infection on the photosynthetic ability of single, attached peach leaves was studied under laboratory conditions using infra red gas analysis. The constants derived from the equations describing the relationship between net photosynthesis (Pn) and both irradiance and CO 2 concentration were used to analyse the effects of infection by PRD on photosynthetic characteristics of the leaf. The asymptotic value of Pn (Pmax) in young leaves was reduced 15 % by PRD-infection, mainly through an increase in the "residual resistance" to 002 diffusion and a decrease of 23 % in the parameter indicating photochemical efficiency. There was also evidence that the gas phase resistance was higher in infected leaves at low levels of irradiance. Dark respiration was 51 % higher in infected leaves, but this difference was not significant. PRD did not reduce Pn in 60 -day-old leaves, normal leaf senescence having a predominant and greater effect. It was concluded that PRD infection had its large effects on growth via a reduction in leaf area; the effects on the photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf area being minor. An effect of PRD infection on the translocation of 14 C-assimilatesout of leaves was also observed. Infected leaves retained twice the assimilates than did uninfected leaves. It is concluded that the most promising methods of control of PRD include removal of infected trees, deblossoming suspected infected trees until diagnosis is confirmed, use of <b>virus-tested</b> plants, the gradual destruction of infected orchards and protecting young, healthy orchards from infection either by barrier crops or deblossoming the young plants until they reach an economic bearing age.
