40|$|The {{success of}} a high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane in {{motivating}} people to shift to carpools and buses depends on maintaining a travel time differential {{between it and the}} adjacent general purpose lanes. This differential, in turn, depends on the level of continuing delay on the general purpose lanes. Therefore, it is clear that a high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane that will motivate people to shift to high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicles</b> will not eliminate congestion. Consequently, {{it is not clear that}} constructing a high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane will necessarily reduce delay more than construction of a general purpose lane. The objective of this research is to determine the circumstances in which this would be the case. The hypothesis is that such circumstances would be quite limited, and this proves to be the case. The intended benefits of high occupancy lanes are defined as reduced person-delay and reduced emissions. A model is developed to calculate these benefits for four alternatives add a high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane, add a general purpose lane, convert an existing lane to a high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane, and do nothing. The model takes into account the initial conditions, the dynamic nature of the travel time differential between the high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane and other lanes, and the uncertainty regarding the extent to which people will shift modes. It combines queueing theory and mode choice theory and provides a robust method for comparing alternatives using a small amount of easily observed data. Application of the model in typical situations shows that with initial delays on the order of 15 min or more, adding a high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane would provide substantial reductions in delay and some reduction in emissions. However, in a wide range of such situations, adding a general purpose lane would be even more effective. Only if the initial delay is long and the initial proportion of high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicles</b> falls in a rather narrow range, would an added high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane be more effective. The proportion of high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicles</b> must be such that it allows good utilization of the high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane while maintaining a sufficient travel time differential to motivate a shift to buses or carpools. Adding a high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lane to a three lane freeway will be more effective than adding a general purpose lane only if the initial maximum delay is on the order of 35 min or more and the proportion of high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicles</b> is on the order of 20 %. Federal policies encourage construction of high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicle</b> lanes and restrict funding for general purpose lanes in areas that have not attained air quality standards. The findings of this research suggest a need to reconsider these policies.

50|$|A high-occupancy vehicle lane (also {{known as}} an HOV lane, carpool lane, diamond lane, 2+ lane, and transit lane or T2 or T3 lanes in Australia and New Zealand) is a {{restricted}} traffic lane reserved at peak travel times or longer for the exclusive use of vehicles with a driver and one or more passengers, including carpools, vanpools, and transit buses. The normal minimum occupancy level is 2 or 3 occupants.

A typical capacity is the Eurostar, which provides capacity for 12 trains per hour and 800 passengers per train, totaling 9,600 passengers per hour in each direction. By contrast, the Highway Capacity Manual gives a maximum capacity of 2,250 passenger cars per hour per lane, excluding other vehicles, assuming an average <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupancy</b> of 1.57 people. A standard twin track railway has a typical capacity 13% greater than a 6-lane highway (3 lanes each way), while requiring only 40% of the land (1.0/3.0 versus 2.5/7.5 hectares per kilometre of direct/indirect land consumption). The Tokaido Shinkansen line in Japan, has a much higher ratio (with as many as 20,000 passengers per hour per direction).

40|$|The {{conversion}} of high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes {{is currently being}} implemented in metro Atlanta on a demonstration basis and is under consideration for more widespread adoption throughout the metro region. Further {{conversion of}} HOV lanes to HOT lanes is a major policy decision that depends on knowledge of the likely impacts, including the equity of the new HOT lane. Rather than estimating these impacts using modeling or surveys, this study collects revealed preference data {{in the form of}} observed vehicle license plate data and <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupancy</b> data from users of the HOV corridor. Building on a methodology created in Spring 2011, researchers created a new methodology for matching license plate data to <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupancy</b> data that required extensive post-processing of the data. The new methodology also presented an opportunity to take an in-depth look at errors in both occupancy and license plate data (in terms of data collection efforts, processing, and the vehicle registration database). Characteristics of individual vehicles were determined from vehicle registration records associated with the license plate data collected during AM and PM peak periods immediately prior to the HOV lanes conversion to HOT lanes. More than 70, 000 individual vehicle license plates were collected for analysis, and over 3, 500 records are matched to occupancy values. Analysis of these data have shown that government and commercial vehicle were more prevalent in the HOV lane, while hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles were much less common in either lane than expected. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>occupancy</b> data from the first four quarters of data collection were used to create the distribution of occupancy on the HOV and general purpose lane, and then the matched occupancy and license plate data were examined. A sensitivity analysis of the occupancy data established that the current use of uncertain occupancy values is acceptable and that bus and vanpool occupancy should be considered when determining the average occupancy of all vehicles on the HOV lane. Using a bootstrap analysis, vehicle values were compared to <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupancy</b> values and the results found that there is no correlation between vehicle value and <b>vehicle</b> <b>occupancy.</b> A conclusions section suggests possible impacts of the findings on policy decisions as Georgia considers expanding the HOT network. Further research using these data, and additional data that will be collected after the HOT lane opens, will include emissions modeling and a study of changes in vehicle characteristics associated with the HOT lane conversion.

40|$|Simulations {{and field}} {{experiments}} in previous works {{suggest that a}} freeway’s general purpose lanes (those not dedicated to high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicles)</b> discharge vehicles from bottlenecks at an equal or higher average rate {{when one of the}} lanes is devoted to high <b>occupancy</b> <b>vehicles</b> than when it is not.
