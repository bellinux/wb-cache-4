5|$|On December 4, 2008, Harper asked Governor General Michaëlle Jean to prorogue {{parliament}} {{to avoid a}} <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> scheduled for the following Monday, becoming the first Canadian prime minister to do so. The request was granted by Jean, and the prorogation lasted until January 26, 2009. The opposition coalition dissolved shortly after, with the Conservatives winning a Liberal supported confidence vote on January 29, 2009.|$|E
5|$|The House of Representatives has {{the power}} to appoint the prime minister, make {{constitutional}} amendments, call for a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> on the prime minister, and make suggestions on foreign and domestic policy. The Council of the Republic {{has the power}} to select various government officials, conduct an impeachment trial of the president, and accept or reject the bills passed by the House of Representatives. Each chamber has the ability to veto any law passed by local officials if it is contrary to the constitution.|$|E
5|$|Gough Whitlam {{saw that}} the party had little chance of being elected unless it could expand its appeal from the {{traditional}} working-class base to include the suburban middle class. He sought to shift control of the ALP from union officials to the parliamentary party, and hoped that even rank-and-file party members could be given {{a voice in the}} conference. In 1968, controversy erupted within the party when the executive refused to seat new Tasmanian delegate Brian Harradine, a Whitlam supporter who was considered a right-wing extremist. Whitlam resigned the leadership, demanding a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> from caucus. He defeated Cairns for the leadership in an unexpectedly close 38–32 vote. Despite the vote, the executive refused to seat Harradine.|$|E

50|$|A {{constructive}} <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> by the Joint Committee {{requires a}} two-thirds majority (instead of just the majority <b>of</b> the <b>votes</b> needed for a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> by the Bundestag).|$|R
5|$|In a {{referendum}} {{called by the}} National Council, and held {{on the same day}} as {{the second round of the}} presidential election, the electorate voted to overturn a law providing for the nationalization of citizens' share in the major national insurance company. Nearly three quarters of the votes were cast against the law. After both election and referendum results were announced, the Prime Minister Janez Janša announced that he might resign, following what he perceived to be a heavy defeat for the Government. The Government later won a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in the National Assembly.|$|E
5|$|On , {{a senior}} army officer on active duty, Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice, {{prompted}} a second crisis {{when he went}} public with allegations that Lloyd George had lied to Parliament on military matters. Asquith, the Liberal leader in the House, took up the allegations and attacked Lloyd George (also a Liberal). While Asquith's presentation was poor, Lloyd George vigorously defended his position, treating the debate as a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence.</b> He won over the House with a powerful refutation of Maurice's allegations. The main results were to strengthen Lloyd George, weaken Asquith, end public criticism of overall strategy, and strengthen civilian control of the military. Meanwhile, the German offensive stalled and was ultimately reversed. Victory came on 11 November 1918.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{power is}} {{exercised}} by the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers {{which make up}} the government, while the legislative power is vested in the unicameral parliament, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature, and the Constitutional Court is charged with ruling on the conformity of laws and decrees with the constitution. The Council of State is the tribunal of last resort for administrative cases, and the High Court of Appeals for all others. The prime minister is elected by the parliament through a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in the government and is most often {{the head of the}} party having the most seats in parliament. The prime minister is Binali Yıldırım, who replaced Ahmet Davutoğlu on 24 May 2016.|$|E
50|$|MP Abbas Al-Khdhari grilled the {{minister}} on May 4, 1999. Then 20 MPs submitted two <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> motions against {{the minister}}. Subsequently, the National Assembly was dissolved constitutionally. This {{was the first}} constitutional dissolution of the parliament. Al-Kulaib was the fourth elected minister to be grilled and second elected minister against whom a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> motion was submitted. It was first time two <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> motions were submitted.|$|R
2500|$|The Riksdag can cast a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> {{against any}} single cabinet {{minister}} (...) , thus forcing a resignation. To succeed a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> must {{be supported by}} an absolute majority (175 members) or it has failed.|$|R
50|$|MP Mufarrej Nahar Al-Mutairi grilled the {{minister}}. The minister {{survived the}} <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence.</b> This {{was the third}} elected minister to be grilled and first elected minister against whom a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> motion was submitted.|$|R
5|$|Initially, President Grinius {{refused to}} resign, {{but he was}} {{eventually}} persuaded that Polish invasion was imminent and that Smetona had sworn to uphold the constitution. On 19 December 42 delegates of the Seimas met (without the Social Democrats or the Peasant Popular Union) and elected Aleksandras Stulginskis as the new Speaker of the Seimas. Stulginskis was the formal head of state {{for a few hours}} before Smetona was elected as the President (38 deputies voted for, two against, and two abstained). The Seimas also passed a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in the new cabinet formed by Voldemaras. Constitutional formalities were observed thereby. The Lithuanian National Union secured other major roles: Antanas Merkys assumed office as Minister of Defense and Ignas Musteikis as Minister of the Interior.|$|E
5|$|By gaining {{power through}} a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> {{from the people}} and then willingly {{surrendering}} power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a long-term impact on the succession process that would eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in a classical republic. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, {{it was one of}} many important changes of power in a society that {{was in the process of}} moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an elected official. Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable of handling the duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent squandering of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding to the will of the people, Selvo helped shape a society that would eventually create a complicated system to check the power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental branches that checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into a classical republic.|$|E
5|$|The Government is {{responsible}} to the Croatian Parliament; the parliament may recall the Government as a whole or {{any member of the}} Government in particular by an absolute majority vote (majority of all MPs) following a request for a confidence vote by one fifth of the parliament members or by the prime minister. The prime minister {{and other members of the}} Government are jointly responsible for decisions passed by the Government and individually responsible for their respective portfolios (areas of responsibility). The President of the Republic appoints the prime minister, who must then secure a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> from the Croatian Parliament (majority of all MPs); the appointment is therefore counter-signed by the speaker of the parliament to signify this. Appointments of members of the Government are done by the prime minister with the approval of the Croatian Parliament (again signified via a counter-signature by the speaker of the parliament). The rules of procedure and regulations enacted by the Government must be published in Narodne Novine—the official gazette of Croatia—to be binding.|$|E
50|$|The Riksdag can cast a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> {{against any}} single cabinet {{minister}} (Statsråd), thus forcing a resignation. To succeed a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> must {{be supported by}} an absolute majority (175 members) or it has failed.|$|R

50|$|With the {{exception}} of the Prime Minister, cabinet ministers (statsråd) do not need the approval of the Riksdag, but they can be forced to resign by a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence.</b> If the Prime Minister is forced by a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> to resign, the entire cabinet falls, and the process of electing a Prime minister starts over. The Prime Minister can dissolve the Riksdag, even after receiving a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence,</b> except during the first three months after an election.|$|R
25|$|On 6 October 2006, Gyurcsány won a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in Parliament, 207–165, with no {{coalition}} MP {{voting against}} him. The vote was public.|$|E
25|$|All parties {{within the}} Swedish {{opposition}} {{have opened up}} for a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> against cabinet ministers Anna Johansson, Anders Ygeman and Peter Hultqvist in order to remove them from office, with some parties calling for <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> against Löfven as Prime Minister. Such a vote would, if supported by several parties, result in a removal of the Löfven cabinet. In a press conference on 27 July Löfven announced a government reshuffling with Ygeman and Johansson resigning. He also stated {{that he would not}} resign himself over the incident.|$|E
25|$|However, if no overall {{majority}} {{was obtained}} {{on the first}} <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence,</b> then the same nominee and program is resubmitted for a second vote within forty-eight hours. Following the second vote, if confidence by the Cortes is still unreached, then the monarch again meets with political leaders and the Speaker, and submits a new nominee for a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence.</b> If, within two months, no candidate has won {{the confidence of the}} Cortes then the king dissolves the Cortes and calls for a new General Election. The king's royal decree is countersigned by the Speaker of the Congress.|$|E

This vote succeeded, marking {{the first time that}} a Danish cabinet was ousted by a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> from the Folketing.

25|$|In August 1884, only a {{month after}} {{returning}} to parliament, Stout passed a <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> in the conservative Harry Atkinson, and assumed the premiership. Julius Vogel was made treasurer, thereby gaining a considerable measure {{of power in the}} administration. Stout's new government lasted less than two weeks, however, with Atkinson managing to pass his own <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence</b> against Stout. Atkinson himself, however, failed to establish a government, and was removed by yet another <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> no <b>confidence.</b> Stout and Vogel returned to power once again.|$|R
