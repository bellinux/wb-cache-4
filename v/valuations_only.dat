We generalize Dirichlet’s S-unit theorem {{from the}} usual group of S-units of a number field K to the {{infinite}} rank group of all algebraic numbers having nontrivial <b>valuations</b> <b>only</b> on places lying over S. Specifically, we demonstrate that the group of algebraic S-units modulo torsion is a Q-vector space which, when normed by the Weil height, spans a hyperplane determined by the product formula, and that the elements of this vector space which are linearly independent over Q retain their linear independence over R. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a large market in which sellers compete by {{offering}} auctions to buyers instead of simple fixed price contracts. Two variants {{of the model}} are studied. One extends a model first analyzed by Wolinsky (1988) in which buyers learn their <b>valuations</b> <b>only</b> after meeting sellers. The other variant extends the model of McAfee (1993) in which buyers know their valuations before they choose among available auctions. The equilibrium array of auctions is characterized for each case and the efficiency properties of the equilibria are analyzed. ...|$|E

40|$|Marketing {{researchers}} have begun exploring actor network theory {{as a way}} of understanding how marketers and marketing concepts contribute to the shaping and developing of markets. This paper strikes out in a new direction by considering the development of a market in an industrial setting, namely for mature or second-hand oil and gas fields, especially in the UK, since the mid- 1990 s. The market is thin and has no standard mode of exchange. Buyers and sellers develop <b>valuations</b> <b>only</b> in part because oil and gas fields are objects in markets, also representing them as situated in networks of production. Hence, different versions and valuations persist throughout an episode of exchange. The paper suggests that in industrial settings, concerns of production are taken into account in order to support something like a market exchange, rather than spilling over and becoming potential sources of later surprise and upset to otherwise well-ordered exchanges...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} consumer returns policies. In our model, consumers face valuation uncertainty and realize their <b>valuations</b> <b>only</b> after purchase. There is also aggregate demand uncertainty, captured using the conventional newsvendor model. In this environment, consumers decide whether to purchase and then whether to return the product, whereas the seller sets the price, quantity, and refund amount. Using our model, we study the impact of full returns policies (e. g., using 100 % money-back guarantees) and partial returns policies (e. g., when restocking fees are charged) on supply chain performance. Next, we demonstrate that consumer returns policies may distort incentives under common supply contracts (such as manufacturer buy-backs), and we propose strategies to coordinate the supply chain {{in the presence of}} consumer returns. Finally, we explore several extensions and demonstrate the robustness of our findings. consumer returns, supply chains, valuation uncertainty, newsvendor model, supply contracts...|$|E
40|$|The advance selling {{strategy}} is implemented when a firm offers consumers the oppor-tunity to order its product {{in advance of}} the regular selling season. Advance selling reduces uncertainty for both the firm and the buyer and enables the firm to update its forecast of future demand. The distinctive feature of the present study of advance selling is that we divide consumers into two groups, experienced and inexperienced. Experienced consumers know their valuations of the product in advance, while inexperienced consumers learn their <b>valuations</b> <b>only</b> in the regular selling season. The presence of experienced consumers yields new insights. Specifically, pre-orders from experienced consumers lead to a more precise forecast of future demand by the firm. We show that the firm will always adopt advance selling and that the optimal pre-order price may be at a discount or a premium relative to the regular selling price...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{consider}} combinatorial markets with <b>valuations</b> <b>only</b> for singletons and pairs of buy/sell-orders for swapping two items in equal quantity. We provide an algorithm that permits polynomial time market-clearing and -pricing. The results are presented {{in the context of}} our main application: the futures opening auction problem. Futures contracts are an important tool to mitigate market risk and counterparty credit risk. In futures markets these contracts can be traded with varying expiration dates and underlyings. A common hedging strategy is to roll positions forward into the next expiration date, however this strategy comes with significant operational risk. To address this risk, exchanges started to offer so-called futures contract combinations, which allow the traders for swapping two futures contracts with different expiration dates or for swapping two futures contracts with different underlyings. In theory, the price is in both cases the difference of the two involved futures contracts. However, in particular in the opening auctions price inefficiencies often occur due to suboptimal clearing, leading to potential arbitrage opportunities. We present a minimum cost flow formulation of the futures opening auction problem that guarantees consistent prices. The core ideas are to model orders as arcs in a network, to enforce the equilibrium conditions with the help of two hierarchical objectives, and to combine these objectives into a single weighted objective while preserving the price information of dual optimal solutions. The resulting optimization problem can be solved in polynomial time and computational tests establish an empirical performance suitable for production environments.

40|$|In {{mechanism}} design, we {{replace the}} strong assumption that each player knows his own payoff type exactly {{with the more}} realistic assumption that he knows it only approximately: each player i only knows that his true type [theta]i; is one among a set [Kappa]i, and adversarially and secretly chosen in Ki {{at the beginning of}} the game. This model is closely related to the Knightian [20] notion of uncertainty in economics, but we consider it from purely mechanism design's perspective. In particular, we study the classical problem of maximizing social welfare in auctions when players know their true <b>valuations</b> <b>only</b> within a constant multiplicative factor [delta] [xi] (0, 1). For single good auctions, we prove that no dominant-strategy mechanism can guarantee better social welfare than assigning the good to a random player. On the positive side, we provide tight upper and lower bounds for the social welfare achievable in undominated strategies, whether deterministically or probabilistically. For multiple-good auctions, we prove that all dominant-strategy mechanisms can guarantee only an exponentially small fraction of the maximum social welfare, and the celebrated VCG mechanism (which is no longer dominant-strategy) guarantees, in undominated strategies, at most a doubly exponentially small fraction. For general games beyond auctions, we provide definitional foundations for this new approximate-type model, and provide a universality result showing that all reasonable (including Bayesian or Knightian) models of type uncertainty are equivalent to our set-theoretic one, at least for the setting when the type space is "convex".

40|$|A {{theory of}} value {{sits at the}} core of every school of {{economic}} thought and directs the allocation of resources to competing uses. Ecological resources complicate the modem neoclassical approach to determining value due to their complex nature, considerable non-market values and the difficulty in assigning property rights. Application of the market model through economic <b>valuation</b> <b>only</b> provides analytical solutions based on virtual markets, and neither the demand nor supply-side techniques of valuation can adequately consider the complex set of biophysical and ecological relations that lead to the provision of ecosystem goods and services. This paper sets out a conceptual framework for a complex systems approach to the value of ecological resources. This approach is based on there being both an intrinsic quality of ecological resources and a subjective evaluation by the consumer. Both elements are necessary for economic value. This conceptual framework points the way towards a theory of value that incorporates both elements, so has implications for principles by which ecological resources can be allocated.

40|$|Abstract: We {{set out in}} {{the present}} study to examine the market value of {{comprehensive}} disclosure of information relating to the compensation paid to directors and executives. Under the theory of self selection, firms with higher levels of board independence will tend to provide comprehensive disclosure of compensation, thereby leading to lower agency conflicts. Since the authorities in Taiwan chose to adopt a policy of gradual enforcement of compensation disclosure, firms are provided with discretion with regard to any greater levels of transparency that they may choose to provide. We therefore exploit this unique natural experimental setting {{to examine the effects of}} compensation disclosure on market value. The evidence indicates that the market provides a higher <b>valuation</b> <b>only</b> to those firms which elect to voluntarily disclose comprehensive information on their compensation practices. However, we also find that even where such disclosure is in excess of the minimum mandatory requirements, lower levels of transparency in the overall disclosure of compensation practices are of very little help with regard to the creation of market value...|$|R

The difficulty {{comes from the fact that}} desire does not depend on pleasure as an impression, but on the force of an idea of pleasure, based upon a belief in the realisation of the correlative impression. Typically, this belief is linked to the underlying emotional state, expressed in the degree of violence of the passions, which governs both the individual's reactivity to pleasure, and his preference for present (compared to future) pleasures. On the contrary, interest and happiness do not depend on the distortion introduced by beliefs, and are directly linked to pleasure.

A subset of investors, sophisticated investors, can buy a technology to value a given number of projects, and reject those with low payoffs, Because rejected projects can seek funding from other investors, there are strategic complementarities in the capacity for valuation, the private benefits to valuation exceed its social benefits, and the market can exhibit multiple equilibria.

40|$|To {{understand}} the role of forest products in households people need to {{understand the}} nature of rural livelihoods and the characteristics of forest products. Rural households typically have a wide livelihood portfolio, encompassing a range of activities. They also generally face low availability of capital, are prone to risks and have little formal education. Many forest products are common pool resources, with some showing very little exclusivity. Many of them can be brought into a marketing chain with minimum capital investment. In the face of risk, forest products are often a source of sustenance or can be used to raise cash in the case of emergencies. Most forest products do not require high skill levels to bring them into production. There is thus a strong match between the characteristics of the rural poor and the characteristics of forest products. While this book is focussed on households, it is always necessary to see the household within the broader framework, of national policies, of a specific macro-economic framework, of international tourist markets, of a global climate, etc. The book is directed to non-economists working in the context of developing countries. The purpose is to provide an overview of methods that may be used to assess the economic importance of forests to household livelihoods. The methods are presented with a number of examples of their use, most of them drawn from developing countries. There is a danger that the numbers derived by valuation become ends in themselves.

40|$|In health economics, {{health-related}} {{quality of}} life (HRQoL) is often assessed by means of preference‐based index measurement instruments (e. g. EQ‐ 5 D, SF‐ 6 D, HUI). Each instrument of this kind consists of (1) a multi‐attribute classification system for distinguishing health states and (2) a scoring function which assigns a valuation to each health state distinguished within the classification system. Scoring functions are often produced according to the so‐called statistical approach which consists of two steps: (1) the valuations {{of some of the}} health states of the classification system are empirically determined and (2) the scoring function values for all health states are estimated from the empirically determined valuations using a theoretical model, i. e. an index model. This approach can run into problems because the empirically determined valuations necessarily contain arbitrary settings. This article is concerned with how these arbitrary settings together with the index model affect the final scoring function values.

We find that measures of accounting bias are incrementally useful in explaining the valuation of bank equity. Specifically, the change in cumulative accounting conservative bias is positively related to the market value, which is consistent with the prediction of our valuation model; the cumulative accounting bias is negatively related to market value, which is not consistent with the prediction from valuation model. Further analysis shows that the negative effect of cumulative accounting conservatism on <b>valuation</b> <b>only</b> exists for a particular group of banks with regulatory enforced conservatism.
