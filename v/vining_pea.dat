40|$|Four <b>vining</b> <b>pea</b> (Pisum sativum L.) cultivars 'Tere', 'Piri', 'Pania', and 'Greenfeast 68 ' (Gf. 68) {{were grown}} either with {{irrigation}} at start of flowering and pod fill, or without (natural rainfall). Harvesting began once peas reached tenderometer (TR) 90 and continued daily until TR 140 was exceeded. Harvested samples were threshed in a mini-viner, and green pea yield, TR and average sieve size were measured. Subsamples were analysed for alcohol insoluble solids (AIS), total solids (TS) and weight per pea. Botanical characteristics, yield components and total vine yield were also measured. TR was {{highly correlated with}} AIS and {{found to be a}} fast and reliable method for measuring maturity of peas, although the TR-AIS relationship varied between treatments. AIS and TS would be useful methods for measuring maturity when a tenderometer is not available. Irrigation prolonged flowering, delayed harvest, and reduced the rate of TR advance during the first four days of harvest. Irrigation also prolonged the harvest period for all cultivars except Pania. The effect of irrigation treatments on green pea yield was confounded by a period of heavy rain which caused waterlogging and subsequent yield depression in irrigated treatments of Piri, Pania, and Gf. 68. In contrast, the pea yield of the natural rainfall treatments was enhanced by the rainfall. The heavy rain prevented measurement of the differences in the yield response of cultivars to irrigation treatments. Total vine yield, stem length, and number of peas per pod were also adversely affected by waterlogging. Pea yield of Gf. 68 was also reduced by vining difficulties attributed to the pointed pod of this cultivar. Tere, the earliest cultivar, was not adversely affected by the heavy rain. Irrigation enhanced green pea yield of Tere by 20 % due to increases in the number of peas per pod and pods per node. Yield increased with maturation but the rate of increase became smaller with advancing maturity. The curvilinear yield-TR relationship became linear when yield was plotted against log(TR- 75). Differences in yield-TR relationships were measured by comparing regressions of relative yield (yield at TR 105 = 100) against log (TR- 75). The respective relationships for natural rainfall and irrigated treatments of Tere were: Y = 27. 5 + 49. 1 X, and Y = - 21. 7 + 82. 4 X, where Y = relative yield and X = log(TR- 75). The four cultivars did not differ from each other in their yield-TR relationships within each irrigation treatment. The yield-TR relationships of Piri, Pania, and Gf. 68, in contrast to Tere, were unaffected by irrigation, although the period of heavy rain probably influenced these results. The gross return-TR relationship was similar for all cultivar x irrigation treatments, indicating that one payment scale may be equally applicable to newer cultivars as it is to older, less determinate cultivars (e. g. Gf. 68). Gross return was negatively correlated with maturity, and was highest for peas harvested below TR 100. The smallest gross returns for most treatments were for peas at TR 120 to 130. Yield calculated from yield components over-estimated <b>vining</b> <b>pea</b> yield and was found to be unreliable as a method for yield prediction. This was attributed to problems associated with the early growth stage at which the yield components were measured...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted on}} vining peas under field conditions and their growth was followed using growth analysis techniques. In the first experiment, cv Victory Freezer was grown to maturity and the growth parameters total plant dry mass, leaf area and leaf dry mass recorded at weekly intervals for each of four planting densities. Determination of weekly values of R,E and F where R is mean relative growth rate, E is mean net assimilation rate and F is mean leaf area ratio, was unsatisfactory due to harvest variability. By fitting loge values of each parameter over the harvest period to quadratic functions, of the form Ŷ = a + bT + cT 2 where Ŷ is the derived parameter value, a, b, and c are regression constants and T is time, {{it was possible to}} calculate instantaneous values for R, E and F. Calculation of R over the whole of growth by this method was not satisfactory. A third method of deriving R, E and F was then attempted by fitting the logistic function W = A(1 -e-(λ +kT) θ) 1 /θ where W is the required parameter, A is the asymptote, e the base of natural logarithms, λ, k and θ are constants and T time. Values of R obtained by this method appeared to more closely approximate to the growth patterns of peas. However, due to the non-asymptotic growth of leaves the method was not suited to derivation of E and F over the whole of growth. Fitting of growth parameters to the model was also difficult where appreciable variability existed in the parameter to be fitted. At the lower plant densities, Relative Growth Rate was maintained at a higher level for much of the growth period apparently due to a higher net assimilation rate. In this experiment maximum yield was shown to occur at the highest plant densities. This was despite lower numbers of pods per plant; numbers of peas per pod and individual pea fresh mass being little affected by density. The second experiment compared three near isogenic lines of cv Dark Skinned Perfection <b>vining</b> <b>pea,</b> differing only in the expression of leaf, tendril and stipule. Each was grown at the same range of densities as in the first experiment. By the time that this experiment was half grown, the weather conditions were unfavourable for growth, with strong winds, heavy rain and low light levels. These conditions were ideal for the spread of fungal disease and the combination of weather and disease made growth very erratic. Despite the poor conditions recording of growth parameters continued until no further plots were available for harvest. At that stage only a few plots had commenced fruiting and little yield data was obtained. The very variable growth parameter records made interpretation of R,E and F almost impossible. The ease of fitting the quadratic function made it seem that this was the only method worth attempting for derivation of R, E and F values over the experimental period. Results obtained showed that in contrast to the first experiment the higher density of planting conferred many benefits to the peas. Higher leaf area ratios in the more closely planted plots led to larger values of R in this experiment. Weather effects on density were mirrored in leaf reduction where the relative growth rate of the least leafy cultivar was much lower than for the more conventional types, due again to lower values of F. The difficulty in obtaining meaningful mean values of the derived functions in both experiments suggests that different methods of deriving R, E and F are desirable. Using quadratic regression to derive these functions is limited in following whole of growth changes. Fitting of the logistic model is also difficult particularly where harvest variability is high and where the parameters are not basically asymptotic in form. It is suggested that fitting of functions to data over only part of growth may be advisable...|$|E

Half of the wheat crop was grown in East Anglia, together with more than 40% of potatoes, 63% of <b>vining</b> <b>peas,</b> and 72% of sugar beets, field beans, and dried peas.|$|R
40|$|Autumn-winter sowing of <b>vining</b> <b>peas</b> (Pisum sativum) is not practised in Canterbury, New Zealand, {{although}} some farmers have been sowing some cultivars of field peas for many years. A field experiment to measure emergence and winter survival of autumn sown <b>vining</b> <b>peas</b> was established on a Wakanui silt loam at Lincoln College. The cultivar Pania was sown on March 25 th, April 15 th, May 7 th and May 30 th, using seed which {{was treated with}} either captan or captan plus metalaxyl (Apron SD 70 WP). The total emergence for the March 25 th, Apri 115 th, May 7 th and May 30 th sowing dates was 89, 84, 72 and 79 % respectively. The emergence times were 8, 13, 13 and 15 days for the above sowing dates. Compared to the March sowing the total emergence of the April and May sowings decreased by 5. 5 %, 13 % and 11 % respectively. At August the plants in the May sowings had a shorter internodal distance which decreased 6. 5 mm, 3. 2 mm and 2. 4 mm for the mean monthly temperature changes of 1. 2, 4. 6 and 1. 7 °C. Consequently the plants in the May sowings developed a rosette stature which increased their winter tolerance as all leaves were green and normal. In early August the plants in the March and April sowings had only 24 % and 45 % of their nodes with actively photosynthesising leaves due to the infection of bacterial disease (Pseudomonas syringae), probably accentuated by frost damage. The bacterial disease killed the leaves on nodes 1 to 8 and 1 to 7 on the March and April sowings respectively. Aphids colonised all of the sowings except the fourth, {{but by the end}} of August overwintering aphid populations were reduced due to increasing plant height and diseased foliage providing an unsatisfactory environment. The March and April sowings flowered in early June and August at times when frost injury may have caused flowers to abort. Some recommendations for autumn sowing of <b>vining</b> <b>peas</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{content of}} low {{molecular}} weight carbohydrates (LMWC, glucose, fructose, sucrose, raffinose, stachyose and verbascose) was investigated in 29 cultivars of <b>vining</b> <b>peas</b> after blanching and freezing. The peas were harvested {{at about the same}} degree of ripeness. There was a positive correlation between the amount of raffinose, stachyose and sorbitol, while a high content of verbascose only could be seen when there was a low content of these sugars. High concentrations of sucrose were generally associated with high concentrations of glucose and fructose. Samples from 1999 had a significantly (p < 0. 001) higher content of raffinose, stachyose and sorbitol and lower of verbascose, probably because of the drier and warmer summer that year compared with 1998. Furthermore, medium and late maturing cultivars contained larger amounts of raffinose, stachyose and sorbitol than early cultivars, possibly {{due to the fact that}} these cultivars, to a greater extent, were exposed to a higher temperature and more intense sunlight for a longer time. Considerable differences in the content of LMWC could be seen both between the different cultivars and the various trials. Glucose and sucrose were generally similarly affected by cultivar and cultivation conditions, while cultivation conditions had a greater influence on the content of sorbitol and the raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFO; raffinose, stachyose, verbascose) in late-maturing groups. It is concluded that many factors affect the content of LMWC in peas. However, as the content of RFO is comparatively small in <b>vining</b> <b>peas,</b> any nutritional significance of these sugars in the human colon is probably rather small.

40|$|During spring 1996, the {{temporal}} and spatial dynamics of epigeic Collembola, in southern UK, were studied in fields planted with spring barley and <b>vining</b> <b>peas.</b> Composition of the fauna varied according to crop type and position within the field. Proximity of a hedgerow had a major impact upon population dynamics, with more species and a greater over all abundance near field edges. It was the major factor governing the abundance of Isotomurus palustris and Bourletiella hortensis, whereas crop type was most important in determining numbers of Jeannenotia stachi, Sminthurus viridis, Sminthurinus elegans and Lepidocyrus spp. Temporal variation in species abundance was also clear: abundances of J. stachi, B. hortensis, I. palustris and Lepidocyrtus spp. decreased through the sampling period while those of S. viridis and Isotoma viridis increased. Overall, the management practices associated with the two crops were an important determinant of collembolan abundance but not of species composition...|$|R
40|$|Pea growers {{have much}} at stake in getting high yields of peas of prime quality. The income accruing from a pea crop grown for {{processors}} {{is determined by the}} yield as well as quality. Therefore the farmers 2 ̆ 7 efforts are directed toward growing such a crop. Research workers are interested in knowing the yield of peas with known tenderometer values which will indicate the quality of peas. Present methods of field harvesting are costly and time consuming which tend {{to limit the number of}} varieties that can be satisfactorily evaluated for trial. A comparison of sampling techniques with present harvesting methods would determine whether or not a sampling technique could be used to obtain the yield and quality evaluation without harvesting the entire plot. Because of errors in <b>vining</b> <b>peas,</b> large plots are required to make evaluation of yields. If a sampling technique would be satis­factory, the field plots could be much reduced in size which would result in a saving in the cost of the trials. In addition, data were collected on the performance of five commerrcial varieties of peas in Utah. Thus the objectives of the investigation were as follows: 1. To determine how good an estimate can be obtained by taking a sample of the crop in comparison with the complete harvest. 2. To indicate what size of sample is practical and economically plausible. 3. To test the performance of five commercial pea varieties...|$|R
40|$|Verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) can {{contaminate}} crop plants, potentially {{using them}} as secondary hosts, {{which can lead to}} food-borne infection. Currently, {{little is known about the}} influence of the specific plant species on the success of bacterial colonisation. As such, we compared the ability of the VTEC strain, E. coli O 157 :H 7 ‘Sakai’, to colonise the roots and leaves of four leafy vegetables: spinach (Spinacia oleracea), lettuce (Lactuca sativa), <b>vining</b> green <b>pea</b> (Pisum sativum) and prickly lettuce (L. serriola), a wild relative of domesticated lettuce. Also, to determine the drivers of the initial response on interaction with plant tissue, the whole transcriptome of E. coli O 157 :H 7 Sakai was analysed following exposure to plant extracts of varying complexity (spinach leaf lysates or root exudates, and leaf cell wall polysaccharides from spinach or lettuce). Plant extracts were used to reduce heterogeneity inherent in plant-microbe interactions and remove the effect of plant immunity. This dual approach provided information on the initial adaptive response of E. coli O 157 :H 7 Sakai to the plant environment together with the influence of the living plant during bacterial establishment and colonisation. Results showed that both the plant tissue type and the plant species strongly influence the short-term (1 hour) transcriptional response to extracts as well as longer-term (10 days) plant colonisation or persistence. We show that propagation temperature (37 versus 18 oC) has a major impact on the expression profile and therefore preadaptation of bacteria to a plant-relevant temperature is necessary to avoid misleading temperature-dependent wholescale gene-expression changes in response to plant material. For each of the plant extracts tested, the largest group of (annotated) differentially regulated genes were associated with metabolism. However, large-scale differences in the metabolic and biosynthetic pathways between treatment types indicate specificity in substrate utilisation. Induction of stress-response genes reflected the apparent physiological status of the bacterial genes in each extract, as a result of glutamate-dependent acid resistance, nutrient stress or translational stalling. A large proportion of differentially regulated genes are uncharacterised (annotated as hypothetical), which could indicate yet to be described functional roles associated with plant interaction for E. coli O 157 :H 7 Sakai...|$|R
40|$|Field {{experiments}} were conducted at Lincoln College, Canterbury, from 1979 - 81 {{to assess the}} effect of peas (pisum sativum) on subsequent crops and evaluate factors influencing their N-fixing activity. In two trials, spring-sown peas harvested green or dry were grown to contrast with barley. On a low fertility soil, wheat yielded 73 and 61 percent more grain respectively following the two pea harvests when compared with barley. Wheat after lupins yielded 85 % more than after barley. Seed size in wheat was 31. 8 mg after barley but 39. 7 mg after legumes. In the second trial, which was on a more fertile soil, winter-grown ryegrass produced 34 and 23 per cent more biomass after <b>vining</b> and seed <b>peas</b> respectively. Pea residues were removed and contained 6. 8 and 2. 7 g N m⁻² at green and dry pea stages respectively. Nitrogen harvest index (NHI) was 0. 47 and 0. 85 at the respective stages. Peas harvested dry relied on soil N for 50 per cent of their N requirements. Also on a high fertility soil, winter ryegrass after spring-sown peas and lupins yielded 25 and 11 % respectively more than after wheat. Incorporation of green pea residues to the soil would further increase subsequent crop yield, but most N is removed in seed at final harvest. These trials clearly showed the benefits from growing peas compared with cereals in crop rotations. The NHI and soil N uptake, however, limits soil nitrogen increases after peas. The following four factors influencing pea N fixation were evaluated with peas cv. Puke sown in late spring (13 / 11 / 80). Treatments were 1) 8 t ha⁻¹ straw incorporated at sowing; 2) irrigation during flowering and pod filling; 3) 4. 5 g N m⁻² at nodule formation; and 4) 4. 5 g N m⁻² at flowering: Overall treatment responses were small because of adequate soil nitrogen and 114 mm rainfall during pod-filling. Nitrate (0 - 20 cm) was 34 ppm N at sowing and straw halved this to 20 ppm N, 36 days after sowing. Straw increased, and nitrogen reduced, N-fixation but dry seed yield was unaffected by these treatments. Irrigated green pea yield (644 g m⁻²) was increased by 8 % when nitrogen was applied at flowering. Irrigation increased dry seed yield from 305 to 343 g m⁻² Trial 4 -examined 1) the effect of autumn (7 / 5 / 1980) and spring (12 / 9 / 80) sowing, and 2) moisture stress, natural rainfall and irrigation applied from flowering on indeterminate (cv. Partridge) and determinate (cv. Whero) peas. Available soil nitrate of more than 6. 5 ppm N (0 - 20 cm) reduced reliance on N fixation. Autumn sowing increased N fixation by 27 percent, primarily through {{an extended period of}} N fixation. Irrigation of Partridge stimulated vegetative growth at the expense of seed development. At final harvest Partridge and Whero residues contained 16. 8 and 7. 1 g N m⁻² respectively. Soil moisture and sowing date did not significantly influence seed yield. Lupins cv. Unicrop sown in winter (24 / 6 / 80) and spring (12 / 9 / 80) yielded 453 and 251 g m⁻² respectively. In Trial 5, eight pea cultivars were grown without irrigation and seven acetylene reduction assays used to assess N-fixation during growth. Cultivars and their seed yields (g m⁻²) were Whero (262), Partridge (96), Huka (360), Rovar (284), Puke (269), Pania (306), Tere (229), Small Sieve Freezer (270). The highest NHI was recorded in the earliest maturing cultivar, Tere (0. 85) and the lowest in Partridge (0. 38) because of late flowering during drought stress. Whero and Partridge reached peak N fixation activity (5 µmoles C₂H₄ plant⁻¹h⁻¹) 18 and 39 days before flowering respectively. Other cultivars reached peak activity soon after the "start of flowering. Field pea N fixation was twice that of garden peas. In all cultivars, reliance on N fixation for nitrogen requirements during reproductive growth diminished as soil nitrogen uptake increased. Diurnal variation in N fixation activity in cv. Whero was measured at three hourly intervals over three 24 h periods, during bud formation, flowering and pod-filling. The optimum time for a one hour assay was between 1100 and 1400 h NZST but this was not constant. Extrapolation from a single assay to a daily N fixation total could lead to 40 % error. There was no distinct diurnal cycle at bud formation, but at flowering (during drought stress), N fixation increased during the night. In contrast, during pod-filling, N fixation decreased during the night. This was attributed to insufficient carbohydrate for nodule function. Mean N fixation increased from the first to last cycle. Peas enhanced soil fertility when compared with cereals in all trials. Although water stress frequently limits pea yield in Canterbury, when water is adequate, available soil nitrogen will reduce the reliance of peas on N fixation...|$|R
