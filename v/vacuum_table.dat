5000|$|In time, George’s two sons, {{brothers}} George T. ("Taylor") and Frederick Oliver (grandsons {{of original}} founder James), joined and eventually {{took over the}} family business, which, for the first time, would operate under the name [...] "Oliver Brothers". Taylor perfected several procedures for removing surface blemishes and transferring paintings on canvasses with defective supports. In the 1920s, he designed and constructed a prototype <b>vacuum</b> hot <b>table</b> to use in his process for relining paintings, for which he received a patent in 1937 - U.S. Patent# 2,073,802. The <b>vacuum</b> hot <b>table</b> has since been adopted throughout the art restoration and conservation industry for use in restoring paintings on textile supports. Taylor's original prototype table remained in use at Oliver Brothers until the early 2000s.|$|R
5000|$|Systematic Automation, Inc. {{was founded}} in 1983 in Chicago, Illinois. The company moved to a larger {{facility}} in Connecticut to accommodate a doubling of capacity in 1987. Systematic Automation invented a rotary indexing table in 1988, introducing the technology to screen printing applications. That same year, the company entered the UV curing industry {{with the introduction of}} the UVSP Curing Unit. To meet the complex requirements of multicolor screen printed designs, a new line of machines was designed and manufactured in 2001 that consisted of a conveying system for multiple <b>vacuum</b> <b>tables</b> moved successively through screen printing and UV curing work stations. More recently, engineers at the company have developed machines for automatically printing insulated foam can coolers, known as koozies, as well as a fully automatic screen printer for microscope slides or other flat glass. [...] Other notable accomplishments include building a screen printing machine capable of depositing 0.002" [...] lines of platinum 0.002" [...] apart for hydrogen battery wafers used on the Space Shuttle.|$|R
50|$|To use a <b>vacuum</b> <b>table</b> {{one must}} place the work upon {{the table and}} use air dams around the work to {{minimize}} the loss of vacuum to atmospheric pressure. This maximizes force to the work in any attitude that the table may be held, in all axis, that the work may be machined or inspected.|$|E
50|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>table</b> is {{a system}} for holding {{workpieces}} during machining. The device consists of a perforated table top containing a vacuum chamber, and a vacuum pump to keep the vacuum chamber below ambient enough pressure. The workpiece {{is placed on the}} top of the vacuum chamber, and thus held down by the pressure differential between the vacuum chamber and the outside air.|$|E

50|$|A <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Table</b> {{consists}} of a typically flat rigid surface with small holes to move air from under a workpiece, as to apply varying vacuum from between the desired workpiece and table to maintain a clamping force greater than that needed to machine a part, generally, in a Mill, Lathe, EDM (Electro-Discharge Machine, Pantograph or any other commonly used machine in a machine shop environment.|$|E

As a vacuum pump, generally, is designed for high vacuum as opposed to high volume, air dams can be used, again, to increase clamping force. A source for vacuum in some applications may be as simple as a typical shop vac or vacuum cleaner, in light application. Vacuum pumps are the usual vacuum source.|$|E
40|$|Several {{vibration}} and tensile {{tests were}} conducted for four natural fiber hemp composites in order to observe its behavior and acquire the material properties of hemp. Two plates were made on the Cal Poly press table, while the other two plates were made on the Cal Poly <b>vacuum</b> <b>table.</b> All four plates are made of 100 % hemp under three different types of weave. The first plate is called CTPT- 12, has a thickness of 0. 053 inches, and was made on the press table. The second plate is called CTL 4 with a thickness of 0. 152 inches and made on the press table. The third plate is called HL- 10 with a thickness of 0. 2145 inches, and made on the <b>vacuum</b> <b>table.</b> The fourth plate is called CTPT- 12 with a thickness of 0. 264 inches and made on the <b>vacuum</b> <b>table.</b> A second portion {{of the project was}} performed to further study the behavior of hemp composites.

40|$|The Flag of the Formosa Republic in the {{collection}} of the National Taiwan Museum is a national icon. It is a copy of one made in 1895 to mark the formation of a new Taiwanese republic; this replica, described in a contemporary newspaper account as an exact copy, was made in Japan in 1909. The painted flag was an intriguing puzzle. Instrumental analysis and a close study of the flag itself and of surviving historic photographs and records were used to try to establish whether what looked like later additions and repairs were actually part of the original construction. An international team of conservators and scientists from Taiwan, the UK, the USA and Germany carried out the investigation and the conservation treatment. Although dye analysis was inconclusive and it has not yet been possible to ascertain the original colour, it was felt that an addition in the upper right corner and some of the repairs could well be part of the original construction and these were left in situ though other repairs were removed. The paper lining was removed, revealing that the flag was painted on both sides. The fabric was cleaned using a <b>vacuum</b> suction <b>table,</b> while the paint surface was cleaned with swabs.

40|$|Estimate for {{treatment}} report by Toni Owen 5 / 27 / 99, in object file. The {{condition of the}} print was documented with photographs (see enclosed "before treatment" photographs). The surface of the print was dry cleaned with powdered eraser crumbs to remove dirt and grime. The tape adhesive stains visible in the upper center section of the print recto were tested for solubility and reduced using solvents (toluene and ethanol) applied locally to the stains while the print was on the <b>vacuum</b> suction <b>table.</b> The staining in this area was no longer visible after solvent treatment. A variety of solvents were tested on the adhesive impregnated edges of the paper {{but none of the}} solvents successfully solubilized or reduced the staining in this area. The printing inks as well as the numerous ink inscription verso were tested for water solubility prior to water washing of the print. These small tests indicated that a faint orange-red component in the black ink was susceptible to water and might bleed from the ink mix if the print was water washed. The edge tears were repaired with kozo fiber tissue and wheat starch paste. The triangular-shaped loss in the top edge of the paper near the center was filled with a paper of comparable weight and texture and toned with watercolors. Another triangular-shaped loss in the left margin of the paper, larger than others, was also filled with a paper of comparable weight and texture. Smaller edge losses were not filled, as the print would be over matted following treatment. The print was humidified in a chamber for 1 hour and then placed between rag boards and under weights. Treatment preformed November 2001. Dutch...|$|R
40|$|Underground spills of {{volatile}} hydrocarbons (solvents or fuels) can {{be difficult}} to clean up when the hydrocarbons are present both above and below the water table and are found in relatively impermeable clays. Years of groundwater pumping may not completely remove the contamination. Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and the College of Engineering at the University of California at Berkeley (UCB) have collaborated to develop a technique called Dynamic Underground Stripping to remove localized underground spills in a relatively short time. The U. S. Department of Energy`s Office of Environmental Restoration and Waste Management has sponsored a full-scale demonstration of this technique at the LLNL gasoline spill site. When highly concentrated contamination is found above the standing water <b>table,</b> <b>vacuum</b> extraction has been very effective at both removing the contaminant and enhancing biological remediation through the addition of oxygen. Below the water table, however, these advantages cannot be obtained. For such sites where the contamination is too deep for excavation, there are currently no widely applicable cleanup methods. Dynamic Underground Stripping removes separate-phase organic contaminants below the water table by heating the subsurface above the boiling point of water, and then removing both contaminant and water by vacuum extraction. The high temperatures both convert the organic to vapor and enhance other removal paths by increasing diffusion and eliminating sorption. Because this method uses rapid, high-energy techniques in cleaning the soil, it requires an integrated system of underground monitoring and imaging methods to control and evaluate the process in real time...|$|R

Le travail a été réalisé dans le cadre d'un workshop au Centro del bel libro, à Ascona, en Suisse, sous la direction de Renate Mesmer.

40|$|The {{application}} of composites in aircraft structures is based traditionally on fibre reinforced thermosets, rather than thermoplastics, {{since it is}} believed that thermoset matrix composites are more cost effective through both lower materials and processing costs. This view is challenged in the paper which demonstrates a low cost fabrication technology for large aircraft structures based on vacuum forming fibre reinforced thermoplastics. Successful forming of thermoplastic aircraft structures using press technology and tape laying was first presented for the first time by the DLR at ICAS (London, 1986). The cost reduction was achieved here by developing an improved vacuum consolidation process, in which both forming and welding are integrated. The new vacuum consolidation process developed has considerably lower investment costs, requiring a heated <b>vacuum</b> <b>table</b> rather than a hydraulic press, and it may be easily adapted to large components. By design and fabrication of a generic tail rudder for a fighter aircraft in 2000, it is demonstrated that thermoplastic composite structures based on carbon fibre/PEEK prepreg have a potential cost saving of about 30 % compared to the use of traditional carbon fibre/epoxy materials. The demonstrator tail structure was based on load cases and laminate construction for an existing certified composite structure, and was developed in a co-operative programme between EADS and the DLR Institute of Structures and Design in Stuttgart...|$|E
40|$|Table 1 {{indicates}} that the stiffest line is the cryogenic vent line while the most flexible line is the 6 inch insulating <b>vacuum</b> line. The <b>table</b> also shows that the four remaining lines are roughly of the same stiffness. This follows closely {{with the experience of}} installing the U-tubes in the assembly hall. The vent line was by far the stiffest, while the other lines are comparitively more flexible. However, the value for the LAr line is misleading. It is as flexible as the other 1 1 / 2 x 3 lines. Using this as a basis, the collision hall connections should be slightly more stiff, but not appreciably. The vent line represents the only anticipated 'difficulty'. Provided that the building piping is constructed to reasonable tolerances, there should be no need to modify the existing U-tubes for use in the Collision hall. The analysis makes many assumptions which are not completely valid. For example, the inner line is much more flexible than the table indicates. Thus the analysis should not be taken as an absolute measure of the amount of force necessary to deflect the lines. The analysis does provide a means of comparison between individual lines and between the assembly hall and collision hall. The last column in tables 1 and 2 indicate which lines are the stiffest comparatively. In addition, by comparing the stiffness of each line in the collision hall with the corresponding line in the assembly hall, a qualitative assesment can be made as to whether the lines in the collision hall are flexible enough...|$|R
