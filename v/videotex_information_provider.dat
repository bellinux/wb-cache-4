30|$|As {{far as we}} know, {{the current}} study is the first {{investigation}} to reveal the information needs of Japanese consumers regarding the efficacy and safety of OTCs by focusing on the features of the information rather than the information content. As mentioned above, with regard to OTCs, several previous studies have investigated the information sources that they used throughout their purchasing behavior. The current study focused on the step at which consumers chose and purchased specific OTCs based on certain information, seeking to address the following questions: (1) Did pharmacists as <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> and consultation at pharmacies as an information channel ultimately influence consumers’ choices regarding the purchase of specific OTCs? (2) What about other <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> and channels? (3) What information characteristics did consumers expect from their <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> and channels with regard to OTCs? The study identified <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> and channels that ultimately {{had an impact on the}} purchase of OTCs by Japanese consumers; one of the distinctive features of this study was that it investigated information sources by dividing them into <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> and channels. <b>Information</b> <b>providers,</b> each bringing different levels of credibility and expertise, should provide consumers with sufficient information to meet their information needs in order to give significant support to their informed choices regarding OTCs. The study also revealed the information needs of OTC purchasers at every <b>information</b> <b>provider</b> and channel they used, from the viewpoint of the features of the information.|$|R
40|$|Information {{consumers}} in online social networks receive information from multiple <b>information</b> <b>providers,</b> {{which results in}} confusion. The amount of confusion depends on three main factors- (a) attributes of the source, (b) characteristics of the consumer and (c) trust relation between the <b>information</b> <b>provider</b> and the consumer. While information confusion has been qualitatively observed in social networks, no quantitative model or analysis was presented. We present the first quantitative model to analyze confusion {{in the presence of}} multiple <b>information</b> <b>providers.</b> We address the following fundamental issues- (i) What is a good model for confusion? (ii) How does the quality of information degrade due to confusion? (iii) What are good strategies for the <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> to control the power or the intensity with which the information is transmitted? The scenario is modeled as a non-cooperative game with pricing, whose Nash equilibrium provides the solution to the questions posed above. We use data from Twitter (e. g., on full body scan in airports) and diabetes outreach networks to illustrate the analysis. We use the solution of the non-cooperative game to study the confusion levels of consumers, in terms of the aggressiveness and passiveness of the <b>information</b> <b>providers.</b> Results indicate that confusion levels are high in networks in networks in which all <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> are equally trusted. In networks where <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> are unequally trusted, the confusion levels are moderate. Index Terms – Social networks, information, confusion, aggression, passiveness.

Next, the relationship between OTC purchasers’ valuing of OTC information characteristics and their use of each <b>information</b> <b>provider</b> or channel was evaluated using the same approach; the outcome and predictor variables were the use of each <b>information</b> <b>provider</b> or channel (Yes/No) and the valuing of each information characteristic (Yes/No), respectively.

40|$|Word-of-Mouth {{communication}} is an invaluable {{source of information}} for consumers. A comprehensive understanding {{of the flow of}} market information through interpersonal networks is therefore of unique theoretical and practical importance. Present Word-of-Mouth research is receiver centric, largely ignoring the role of the <b>information</b> <b>provider</b> as a gatekeeper to information dissemination. The objective of this research is to develop a more comprehensive understanding of Word-of-Mouth by modelling the decision making behaviour of <b>information</b> <b>providers.</b> Adopting the network theory general assumption of altruistic exchange motivation, this research uses a choice modelling framework to demonstrate that <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> assign greater utility to (1) information about product features important to the receiver, and (2) information which disconfirms receiver preferences. In addition, these effects are found to be moderated by perceptions about the receivers knowledge.

40|$|Abstract—Proliferation {{of health}} related {{information}} on the internet is both welcoming and a concern. For instance when solicited information goes wrong, it tends to have dire consequences on the general public. Assessing the quality of internet health information is often difficult but a rational and systematic approach can be useful in evaluating the quality of the services they render to the public. The paper proposes a fuzzy VIKOR framework for evaluating and ranking internet health <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> under a fuzzy environment where uncertainties and subjectivities are catered for with linguistic variables. Linguistic variables with triangular fuzzy numbers (TFN) are used to evaluate weights of the evaluation criteria and the rankings of each internet health <b>information</b> <b>provider.</b> A numerical example is demonstrated using HIV/AIDS online <b>information</b> <b>providers</b> in the most adult prevalent country in the world. The proposed method is compared with TOPSIS and can be applied in evaluating the quality of other specific internet health <b>information</b> <b>providers.</b> I...|$|R
