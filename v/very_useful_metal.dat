40|$|The {{efficacy}} of wet cleaning on GaN surface {{to remove the}} metal contamination, such as Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn, has been investigated using total-reflection X-ray fluorescence analyzer (TXRF). Metal contamination on GaN surface can be reduced by the solutions with low pH and high redox potential. The start redox potential of the metal oxidation on GaN surface is larger than that of metal itself. Because metal can receive electrons from GaN surface, and then metal cannot be oxidized to ionization by solutions. The metal contamination on GaN can be reduced by the solutions with the pH less than 4. 2 and the redox potential larger than 0. 8 V are required. In addition, the cleaning solution required the etching ability of β-GaO, because some kind of metals include in the native oxide of GaN, which is like β-GaO. This method is <b>very</b> <b>useful</b> for <b>metal</b> cleaning and very effective for reducing chemical consumption...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlkali metal (Li+, Na+, K+) {{intercalated}} titanate nanotubes {{have been}} studied by vibrational spectroscopy (Raman and FT-infrared), X-ray diffraction, and electron microscopy. The vibrational spectroscopic data shown that the most affected vibrational mode is that related to Ti–O bond whose oxygen is not shared among the TiO 6 units of the framework structure. A correlation between vibrational frequency shifts and intercalated metal was found, thus showing that vibrational spectroscopy is <b>very</b> <b>useful</b> for probing <b>metal</b> intercalated titanate nanotubes. Our results provide good evidences that the structure of titanate layers in titanate nanotube, a subject of long debate in the literature, is similar to trititanates (like Na 2 Ti 3 O 7) ...|$|R
40|$|The paper reviews six {{examples}} of CFD applications, useful for: minerals, power generation and oil & gas industry. The review {{starts with the}} multiphase modeling of gas injection into a liquid bath, where the CFD results were validated against experimental data. The example is <b>very</b> <b>useful</b> for <b>metal</b> extraction/refining industry. Simulation of a mineral concentrator bin is presented next, where multiphase modeling was used {{to find out the}} cause of blocking of the slurry pump. The 3 rd example presents two alternative designs, evaluated for better extraction of dust from an underground mine crushing-plant. Multiphase modeling with boiling-heat transfer was used in the next example for investigating a low pressure water cooling system in slag fumers. The next example reviews full scale coal combustion modelling of a tangentially fired boiler with mill ducting. Finally a successful modeling of a gas liquid separator is presented. The CFD software FIRE (AVL 2009) was used in most of the investigations. Geometry dimensions and process data were suppressed as necessary for confidentiality reasons...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have been}} demonstrated to possess excellent electronic properties, a good chemical stability, and a large surface area. 1 These unique properties make carbon nanotubes <b>very</b> <b>useful</b> for supporting <b>metal</b> nanoparticles in many potential applications, ranging from advanced catalytic systems through very sensitive electrochemical sensors to highly efficient fuel cells. 2 Consequently, functionalization of carbon nanotubes with metal nanoparticles has received ever-increasing interest in recent years, and a few interesting routes have now been devised for either covalently or noncovalently attaching certain metal nanoparticles onto carbon nanotubes. 3 - 7 Examples include chemical binding through DNA double-helix linkages, 3 electrochemical deposition, 4 electroless deposition with and {{without the aid of}} reducing agents, 5, 6 and physical/chemical deposition on carbon nanotubes with and without surface activation. 2 a, 7 Among them, the electroless deposition is o...|$|R
40|$|Aluminum is a <b>very</b> <b>useful</b> {{structural}} <b>metal</b> {{employed in}} different industrial sectors, in particular {{it is used}} in large quantities in automotive, aeronautic and nautical industries. The main reasons of its wide use are: a very good oxidation resistance, excellent ductility, low melting temperature (660 °C) and low density (2. 71 g/cm 3). However, {{in order to reduce}} the emissions and fuel consumption is necessary to reduce the overall weight of vehicles by increasing mechanical properties of the structural material. The improvement of mechanical properties is normally achieved through use of reinforcement in materials, used like matrix, in order to improve some specific characteristics. In this work composites of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) dispersed in aluminum were made. The most difficulties in the preparation of this type of composite are represented by the low wettability between metallic matrix and fillers and the possibility of the oxidation of metal during melting with consequent decreasing of mechanical proprieties. The composite was obtained by three consecutive step: the first one is the functionalization of fillers surface to improve the fillers dispersion, the second one is the dispersion of fillers in the matrix by powder mixing and the third one is the melting and casting of the mix prepared. In particular, fillers used are multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with functionalized surface by treatment with a solfonitric solution. Melting and casting are carried out with the aid of an induction furnace with a controlled atmosphere system and centrifugal casting. Argon is the inert gas used to prevent the oxidation of aluminium during fusion. Young’s modulus was evaluated at different temperature and correlated with the different CNTs percentage. The dispersion rate of fillers and the microstructure of the sample were evaluated by FESEM micrograph...|$|R
