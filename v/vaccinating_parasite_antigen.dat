40|$|Twenty {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{have been}} prepared to the erythrocytes from CBA/Ca mice infected with the rodent malaria Plasmodium chabaudi. By immunofluorescence, 15 of these antibodies recognized <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> expressed only during the development of mature trophozoites to schizonts and merozoites, 2 recognized <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> that were expressed {{throughout most of the}} intraerythrocytic cycle, and 3 recognized the membranes of all infected and uninfected erythrocytes. By immunoprecipitation of [35 S]methionine-labeled, parasitized erythrocytes, <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> recognized by all of the antiparasite antibodies were characterized. Eleven precipitated a 250, 000 -dalton parasite polypeptide which was synthesized and expressed late in the intraerythrocytic cell cycle and which appeared to be the major coat protein of the merozoites. In passive protection experiments, transfer of hyperimmune serum before infection with the parasite resulted in a delay in the rise of parasitemia, reduction in peak parasitemias, and a delay in the clearance of the parasitemia. Two monoclonal antibodies to the 250, 000 -dalton polypeptide had a similar but not as marked effect on parasitemia when given as a single dose before infection. When mixed and administered throughout the course of infection, their effects were greater. They had no influence on the course of Plasmodium berghei KSP 11 parasitemia. Monoclonal antibodies to other <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> and normal erythrocyte antigens failed to have a significant and reproducible effect on P. chabaudi parasitemia. The results suggest that this 250, 000 -dalton malaria <b>parasite</b> <b>antigen</b> may be important in the induction and expression of antibody-mediated immunity to malaria...|$|R

40|$|Leishmania donovani {{infection}} in golden hamsters was studied {{as a model}} for human kala-azar. After intradermal inoculation of L. donovani amastigotes, hamsters developed positive skin reactions (delayed-type hypersensitivity [DTH]) to <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> and lymphoid cells from these hamsters proliferated to <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> in vitro and transferred DTH reactivity to normal recipients. In contrast, hamsters infected by the intracardial route developed progressive visceral infections and failed to respond to skin test antigens. Spleen cells, lymph node cells, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from these hamsters were unresponsive to <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> in vitro, and spleen cells failed to transfer DTH to normal recipients. Spleen cells, but not PBLs, displayed depressed responses to T-cell mitogens and also suppressed the proliferative response of cells from hamsters inoculated intradermally. Removal of adherent cells restored the capacity of spleen cells, but not PBLs, to respond to <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens.</b> The nonadherent population of these spleen cells also transferred DTH to normal recipients. The adherent suppressor cells, which have the characteristics of macrophages, appear to be localized to the spleen and are apparently not responsible for the failure of peripheral lymphoid cells to respond to antigen. These studies suggest that hamsters with visceral infections develop a population of antigen-reactive cells and that in the absence of suppression these cells may express functional activities, including the capacity to elicit DTH responses...|$|R

Generally speaking, serological techniques include detection methods for specific antibodies and for circulating <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> in the serum or tissue fluids.

40|$|This study {{identified}} and characterized <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> in sera from humans infected with Onchocerca volvulus. Immune complexes were precipitated from human sera with polyethylene glycol and analyzed by immunoblot with rabbit antibodies to O. volvulus. A 23 -kDa parasite anti-gen was detected in sera from 17 of 23 Nigerian onchocerciasis patients and 5 of 10 endemic controls. Other <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> with apparent molecular masses of 62, 66, and 70 kDa were less consistently observed. These antigens were {{not present in}} Nigerian or US nonendemic con-trol sera, in sera from patients with various other parasitic infections, or in sera from US patients with autoimmune diseases. Biochemical studies indicated that these antigens are nonglycosylated acidic proteins that do not contain phosphorylcholine. These antigens may be useful as targets for improved diagnostic tests for onchocerciasis based on <b>parasite</b> <b>antigen</b> detection. About 20 million people in tropical Africa and Latin America are infected with the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus [1].

40|$|The asexual blood {{stages of}} the human malarial {{parasite}} Plasmodium falciparum produce many antigens, only {{some of which are}} important for protective immunity. Most of the putative protective antigens are believed to be expressed in schizonts and merozoites, the late {{stages of the}} asexual cycle. With the aim of cloning and characterizing genes for important <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens,</b> we used late-stage P. falciparum mRNA to construct a library of cDNA sequences inserted in the Escherichia coli expression vector pUC 8. Nine thousand clones from the expression library were immunologically screened in situ with serum from Aotus monkeys immune to P. falciparum, and 95 clones expressing <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> were identified. Mice were immunized with lysates from 49 of the bacterial clones that reacted with Aotus sera, and the mouse sera were tested for their reactivity with <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> by indirect immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting assays. Several different P. falciparum antigens were identified by these assays. Indirect immunofluorescence studies of extracellular merozoites showed that three of these antigens appear to be located on the merozoite surface. Thus, we have identified cDNA clones to three different P. falciparum antigens that may be important in protective immunity...|$|R
40|$|Antigen {{specific}} immunoregulatory {{phenomena in}} {{both human and}} experimental filariasis are correlated {{with the presence of}} circulating microfilariae. Previous studies of inbred jirds infected with Brugia pahangi have demonstrated that the onset of microfilaremia (8 - 10 weeks post-infection) is associated with a loss of responsiveness to <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> in the spleen, but not the lymph nodes of infected animals. The present experiments defined immunoregulatory phenomena responsible for altered antigen-specific in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis in the spleen of B. pahangi-infected jirds. Diminished splenic responsiveness to B. pahangi antigens was associated with the presence of a cell capable of suppressing the responsiveness of lymph node cells from infected jirds to <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens.</b> antigen-induced in vitro blastogenic responsiveness of spleen cells from microfilaremic, but not normal animals was restored by depletion of cells adherent to nylon wool or bearing receptors for histamine, peanut agglutinin, soybean agglutinin or jird Fc. The responsiveness of spleen cells from chronically infected (greater than or equal to 20 weeks) animals to mitogens, but not <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens,</b> was enhanced by removal of plastic-adherent cells. The results suggest the involvement of antigen-specific suppressor T cells, in the spleen of B. phangi -infected jirds which are distinct from non-specific suppressor cells previously described in this system...|$|R
40|$|Cellular and serum {{antibody}} {{responses of}} calves were monitored for 23 days after oral inoculation of the calves with oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum. In vitro blastogenic responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes were assessed after stimulation with a C. parvum preparation. Specific lymphocyte blastogenic {{responses to the}} parasite were detected 2 days after inoculation. Parasite-specific antibody titers were demonstrable 7 days after inoculation with oocysts and achieved peak levels 9 days after inoculation, coinciding with oocyst shedding at 5 to 10 days after inoculation. Both lymphocyte and antibody responses remained elevated until the termination of the experiment. Immunoblotting the C. parvum preparation with serum from an infected calf revealed six major <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens.</b> Five of these antigens reacted on immunoblots from 7 to 14 days after inoculation with oocysts. A <b>parasite</b> <b>antigen</b> of approximately 11, 000 molecular weight demonstrated intense reactivity on immunoblots from 7 to 23 days after inoculation. The 11, 000 -molecular-weight antigen also reacted on immunoblots with parenterally raised antioocyst and antisporozoite rabbit sera. These results indicate that cell-mediated as well as humoral immune responses are initiated by cryptosporidial infection in calves and that the 11, 000 -molecular-weight <b>parasite</b> <b>antigen</b> is immunodominant.

40|$|Although the basophils and {{mast cells}} of {{patients}} with chronic helminth infection are sensitized with specific IgE antibody and frequently exposed to <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> in vivo, these rarely manifest allergic reactions to their parasites. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms limiting immediate hypersensitivity responsiveness in such patients, we used the in vitro antigen-induced histamine- release (HR) reaction of human basophils as a correlate of in vivo allergic responses. For 13 patients with bancroftian filariasis HR responses were elicited by graded doses of microfilarial antigen {{in the absence of}} serum or in the presence of normal human serum, autologous serum, or serum from other infected patients. In all instances, sera from patients with filariasis contained a factor that specifically inhibited HR to <b>parasite</b> <b>antigen.</b> Normal sera had no such inhibitory effect, but sera from other filariasis patients inhibited as effectively as autologous serum. This HR blocking factor was heat stable (56 °C x 2 hr) and nondialyzable. Its <b>parasite</b> <b>antigen</b> specificity was demonstrated by its inability to block the HR of patient cells triggered by anti-IgE anti-body and its lack of inhibitory effect on the Hr response of ragweed-sensitized cells reacted with ragweed antigen E. Fractionation of the sera by staphylococcus protein A-Sepharose chromatography showed that the blocking factor was an IgG antibody whose activity could be removed by specific immunoabsorption with filarial antigen. The levels of blocking antibody in the sera of these patients were high, comparable to those reported for atopic patients on immunotherapy regimens. These findings demonstrate that IgG blocking antibodies directed against parasite allergens are a regular component of the immune response to chronic filarial infection and suggest their potential role in vivo for specifically modulating allergic responsiveness to <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens...</b>|$|R

In order to determine whether these complexes contain <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens,</b> sera were collected from Brazilian patients with visceral leishmaniasis and from hospitalized control subjects with other diagnoses. High-molecular-weight complexes were precipitated from pooled sera with 2. 5 % polyethylene glycol. Approximately 140 -fold-more protein was precipitated from patient sera than from control sera; 12 % of the total patient serum protein was precipitated. Patient serum precipitates contained immunoglobulins G (525 mg/dl), M (27 mg/dl), and A (8 mg/dl). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the patient serum precipitates revealed multiple bands, including a prominent band at 70 kilodaltons, that were not seen in precipitates of control sera. The 70 -kilodalton band was recognized by human and hamster sera with antileishmanial antibodies, but not by control sera. Finally, immunization of BALB/c mice with the high-molecular-weight precipitates from patients elicited antileishmanial antibodies against L. donovani chagasi antigens as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot (immunoblot) assay. In summary, sera of patients with American visceral leishmaniasis were found to have high-molecular-weight complexes that contained one or more <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens.</b> These complexes {{may play a role in}} the immunology of the disease, and detection of circulating <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> has potential diagnostic importance...|$|R

A murine model of disseminated leishmaniasis utilizing inbred strains of specific genetic constitution was used to study the mechanisms of immunosuppression elicited during the course of infection. Resistant (Lshr) and susceptible (Lshs) strains of mice were challenged with amastigotes of Leishmania donovani and evaluated as to immune status at intervals between 2 and 40 weeks after challenge. The proliferative responses of splenic lymphocytes to T-cell mitogens, a B-cell mitogen, and <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> were measured to evaluate the relative immune status of parasitized mice and noninfected control mice. Lymphocytes from resistant C 3 Heb/FeJ (C 3 H) mice responded normally to concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin throughout the course of infection. <b>Parasite</b> <b>antigen</b> responses appeared 2 weeks after challenge of C 3 H mice and remained vigorous for periods up to 6 months. In contrast, immune suppression during infection was profound in both the curing (C 57 B 1 / 10) and noncuring (B 10. D 2) phenotypes of Lshs congenic mice. Both Lshs strains developed severe infection as evidenced by high parasite burdens in the liver and spleen 4 to 5 weeks after challenge; splenic lymphocytes taken from these mice between 2 and 8 weeks became increasingly unresponsive to the T-cell mitogens as well as to <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens.</b> The noncuring B 10.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the validity of}} the Enzyme-linked Immuno-electro Transfer Blot (EITB) technique to diagnose human hydatidosis using sheep hydatid fluid antigens and human sera infected with hydatidosis. Design: After preparing <b>parasite</b> <b>antigen</b> from sheep hydatid cyst fluid, all collected human sera infected with hydatidosis and other parasitic diseases as well as normal individuals, were analyzed by EITB test to evaluate its validity in diagnosing of hydatidosis...|$|R
40|$|A {{model to}} {{simulate}} natural immunity to Eimeria tenella {{was developed in}} three chicken lines which differ at the B locus of the major histocompatibility complex. Homozygous, 1 -day-old chicks of the B 19 B 19, B 24 B 24, or B 30 B 30 genotype were trickle immunized by being orally fed a small infectious dose of E. tenella oocysts for 5 consecutive days. These naturally exposed birds were then challenged at different times between 5 and 24 days after the final dose, {{and the level of}} protection was assessed 6 days after challenge, using body weight gain and intestinal lesion scores. The duration of immunity in naturally exposed birds differed among the major histocompatibility complex lines. Trickle immunization of the B 19 B 19 haplotype afforded the longest and strongest level of protection compared to the other two haplotypes tested. In addition, in vitro splenic and peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferative responses in trickle-immunized birds were measured against sporozoite, merozoite, and tissue culture-derived E. tenella <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> isolated from the recently described SB-CEV- 1 /F 7 established cell line. The lymphocytes obtained from B 19 B 19 birds trickle immunized responded in vitro to the E. tenella-infected SB-CEV- 1 /F 7 tissue culture-derived <b>parasite</b> <b>antigen.</b> Furthermore, antigen-specific immune responses appeared earlier in immune, challenged B 19 B 19 birds than in their naive, challenged counterparts. The development of a model simulating natural immunization will serve as a foundation to further characterize both humoral and cell-mediated responses to E. tenella tissue culture-derived <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> and to better understand host protective immune responses to avian coccidiosis...|$|R
40|$|Anisakis simplex is a fish {{parasite}} that is {{a public}} health risk to those consuming raw or poorly cooked marine fish and cephalopods because {{of the possibility of}} becoming infested with live larvae. In humans, penetration of the larvae into the gastrointestinal track can cause acute and chronic symptoms and allergic anisakiasis. Excretion and secretion products released by the larvae are thought {{to play a role in}} migration through the tissues and induce an immunoglobulin E-mediated immune response. The aim of this preliminary study was to detect <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> and allergens in fish tissues surrounding the migrating larvae. Hake and anchovy fillets were artificially parasitized with Anisakis larvae and stored in chilled conditions for 5 days. Larvae were evaluated for fluorescence, fish muscle tissue was examined with transmission electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical reactions of two rabbit polyclonal antisera against a parasite crude extract and the allergen Ani s 4 were recorded. Larvae immediately migrated into the fish muscle, and no emission of bluish fluorescence was observed. Fish muscle areas in contact with the parasite showed disruptions in the structure and inclusion of granules within sarcomeres. Both <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> and the Ani s 4 allergen were located in areas close to the larvae and where sarcomere structure was preserved. These findings indicate that <b>parasite</b> <b>antigens</b> and allergens are dispersed into the muscle and might cause allergic symptoms such as dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea, urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis in some individuals sensitive to A. simplex.
