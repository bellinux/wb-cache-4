2500|$|In tow-in surfing (most often, but not exclusively, {{associated}} with big wave surfing), a motorized water vehicle, {{such as a}} personal watercraft, tows the surfer into the wave front, helping the surfer match a large wave's speed, which is generally a higher speed than a self-propelled surfer can produce. Surfing-related sports such as paddle boarding and sea kayaking do not require waves, and other derivative sports such as kite surfing and windsurfing rely primarily on wind for power, yet all of these platforms may {{also be used to}} ride waves. Recently with the use of <b>V-drive</b> boats, Wakesurfing, in which one surfs on the wake of a boat, has emerged. The Guinness Book of World Records recognized a [...] wave ride by Garrett McNamara at Nazaré, Portugal as the largest wave ever surfed.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{configurations}} of an inboard, <b>V-drive</b> and direct drive. A direct drive has the powerplant mounted {{near the middle}} of the boat with the propeller shaft straight out the back, where a <b>V-drive</b> has the powerplant mounted {{in the back of the}} boat facing backwards having the shaft go towards the front of the boat then making a V towards the rear. The <b>V-drive</b> has become increasingly popular due to wakeboarding and wakesurfing.|$|E

50|$|In 1984 the moulds {{were bought}} {{by a new}} company, Corvette Cruisers of Nottingham, who {{redesigned}} the interior and built another 70 up to 1991. During that time significant changes were made to its design to improve handling and overall performance. The sterndrives or <b>V-drives</b> (which were only used on the first 10 boats) were changed to a traditional shaft system, with the engines being moved mid-ships for better weight distribution and enhanced sea-keeping characteristics. Thus in boats built since the 1980s the aft cabin was an altogether more spacious affair. Corvette Cruisers also managed to increase {{the width of the}} front berths so they were big enough, at a squeeze, to sleep two people on each.|$|R

5000|$|As of 2013, the company's best-selling {{line was}} the Centurion Enzo, aV-Drive tow boat geared towards {{producing}} Wakesurfing waves. That year an Enzo was the official towboat of the World Wake Surfing Championship. Another newer model was the Avalanche C4, a <b>V-Drive</b> boat for both wakesurfing and wakeboarding. The Elite V C4 {{model is a}} less expensive <b>V-Drive</b> boat, with a narrower beam and shallower draft. The Carbon Pro is an inboard ski towboat, geared towards tournament ski competition performance.|$|E
50|$|The {{onset of}} the Great Depression {{motivated}} Huckins to build smaller boat designs and to seek more efficient construction methods for larger vessels, such as mounting engines on I-beams supported by the engine room bulkheads, and using belt driven <b>V-drive</b> propulsion systems.|$|E
5000|$|The Air Nautique line-up of nautique boats is Correct Craft's crossover-wakeboarding focused model; {{the boat}} is {{outfitted}} for wakeboarding with a tower and ballast tanks from the factory.

5000|$|Centurion Boats {{was founded}} by Rick and Pam Lee. They {{acquired}} the trade name from a Salt Lake City company, and took their first order by phone in 1976. [...] The first products were inboard ski boats, which were produced in a leased 10,000 square foot facility in Southern California. In 1986 the first <b>V-Drive</b> ski boat was brought to market.|$|E
50|$|Donald Campbell {{began his}} record-breaking career in 1949 {{following}} the death of his father, Sir Malcolm Campbell. Initially, he had been using his fathers 1939-built Rolls-Royce R type powered propeller-driven hydroplane Bluebird K4 for his attempts, but he met with little success and suffered a number of frustrating setbacks. In 1951, K4, which had been modified to a prop-rider configuration to increase its performance potential, was destroyed after suffering a structural failure, when its <b>V-drive</b> gearbox sheared its mountings, and punched through the floor of the hull.|$|E
50|$|Competition skiing uses {{specifically}} designed towboats. Most towboats {{have a very}} small hull and a flat bottom to minimize wake. A true tournament ski boat will have a direct drive motor shaft that centers the weight in the boat for an optimal wake shape. However, some recreational ski boats will have the motor placed {{in the back of}} the boat (<b>v-drive),</b> which creates a bigger wake. Permitted towboats used for tournament water skiing are the Mastercraft ProStar 197, MasterCraft ProStar 190, Nautique 200, Malibu Response TXi, and Centurion Carbon Pro. These boats have ability to pull skiers for trick skiing, jumping, and slalom.|$|E
50|$|The FE {{block was}} {{manufactured}} using a thinwall casting technique, where Ford engineers determined the required amount {{of metal and}} re-engineered the casting process to allow for consistent dimensional results. A Ford FE from the factory weighed 650 lb with all iron components, while similar seven-liter offerings from GM and Chrysler weighed over 700 lb. With an aluminum intake and aluminum water pump the FE could be reduced to under 600 lb. This weight saving was significant to boaters and racers. The FE was popular in <b>V-drive</b> marine applications, available as a factory option in Chris Craft boats.|$|E
50|$|The Scenicruiser was a {{split-level}} model, with a {{lower level}} at the front containing the driving console and 10 seats behind it, and upper level containing 33 seats. This allowed a baggage compartment underneath the second level, while providing 360-degree view for the upper level. A lavatory was located {{in the rear of}} the first level. Scenicruisers were equipped with an air-ride suspension utilizing air bags at each wheel, and were air-conditioned. Later, on model PD-4106 a new design was incorporated, having air-conditioning powered off the engine, a patented <b>V-drive</b> engine-transmission design, and the 6V71 or 8V71 Detroit Diesel motor.|$|E
5000|$|<b>V-drive</b> is a {{propulsion}} system for boats {{that consists of}} two drive shafts, a gearbox, and a propeller. In a [...] "V-drive" [...] boat, the engine is mounted {{in the rear of}} the boat and the front of the engine faces aft. Connected to the rear of the engine is the transmission. The first drive shaft connects the rear of the transmission to a gearbox mounted in the center of the boat. The second drive shaft extends from the gearbox to the rear and out the bottom of the boat to where a propeller is mounted.|$|E
50|$|Original {{transmission}} {{choices were}} a four-speed non-synchronized manual transmission with solenoid reverse and the Allison Automatic VH hydraulic transmission. The latter {{was essentially a}} one-speed automatic transmission which drove the wheels through a torque converter. At sufficient speed a clutch bypassed the torque converter and the engine drove the rear wheels directly. A later option was the VS-2, similar to the VH but with a two-speed planetary gearset with three modes: Hydraulic, direct (1:1), and direct-overdrive. The very last batch of American-built New Looks and most Canadian-built New Looks from 1977 through 1987 use the Allison V730 transmission, a traditional three-speed automatic with a lockup torque converter. These four transmissions were the only <b>V-drive</b> transmissions made.|$|E
50|$|The engines favoured by the {{original}} builders were twin 106 hp Volvo Penta D32s, linked to sterndrives, and 105 hp Mercedes-Benz OM352s, with V-drives, top speed being about 16 knots in each case. This configuration generally required more use of the trim tabs to travel at the optimum angle. In the boats built in the 1970s, the aft cabin was quite limited, much of the space at the stern being {{taken up by the}} sterndrive or <b>V-drive</b> engines that were then installed, although there was still space on the port side for a double berth (the foot of which stretched under the after part of the saloon seating) and a small toilet/shower compartment. Access to the engines was via a door in the cabin.|$|E
5000|$|A {{significant}} portion of wakeboarding boats utilizes <b>V-drive</b> propulsion. These boats have a regular inboard engine, but are turned 180° such that the transmission {{is in front of}} the engine, rather than behind, or [...] "inline", which is a more common layout for inboard tournament ski boats. The prop shaft exits the transmission towards the rear of the boat, so that the prop is placed directly under the engine. When viewed from the side, such a layout appears as a [...] "V" [...] lying on its side. This layout allows for better weight distribution(with the engine farther aft), and places the prop farther forward, reducing the danger of the spinning prop near the stern of the vessel, where riders enter and exit the water.|$|E

5000|$|In 1985 Lesser and Holbek, {{along with}} kayaker Bob McDougall, made a second attempt to kayak the entire canyon. The kayak team {{was joined by}} a raft team of seven {{world-class}} paddlers consisting of Joe Willie Jones, Mark Kosina, Beth Rypins, Peter Fox, Steve Ellsberg, Peggy Lindsay, and Dan Bolster. This expedition was sponsored by a British and Canadian film crew who also provided a helicopter for filming, portage and safety support. Delays due wildly rising and falling water levels and the careful scouting that was needed to analyze the rapids, caused the descent to last several days longer than planned. This ultimately led to the film production crew withdrawing its helicopter support in the Lower Narrows due to cost overruns. The raft team, faced with continuing without helicopter support, chose to portage around the canyon section that contains the notorious rapid now known as [...] "V-Drive" [...] before re-entering the river to run the Tanzilla Slot which {{marked the end of}} the canyon. As of [...] , no other conventional raft has successfully navigated this much of the canyon. Kayakers Lesser, Holbek and McDougall continued, running <b>V-Drive</b> and completing the final section and thus the first descent of the entire canyon, {{with the exception of the}} Site Zed rapid. The film of the descent was called [...] "Hell and High Water".|$|E
50|$|Generally speaking, wakeboard {{specific}} {{boats are}} <b>V-drive</b> boats. This means {{they are an}} inboard boat with the engine placed backwards {{in the rear of}} the boat. This is done to keep more weight in the back of the boat and make the wake larger. Some wakeboard specific boat models are direct drive boats where the engine is in the middle of the boat. Most wakeboard boats will have several features that help to create large wakes. These include ballast, hydrofoil, and hull technology. Ballast is a simple term for weight. When wakeboard boats have ballast tanks, it means that they have room for extra weight to weigh the boat down for larger wakes. For example. If the rider is surfing on the starboard side of the stern. Then you want to activate the starboard ballast in order to give the rider a surf-able wave. All these key features would not be anything if it was not for cruise control. Cruise control innovated wake boarding. Throttles on v drive boats are extremely sensitive and it is hard to get to the desired speed of the rider. When cruise control is set the driver can push the throttle all the way down and the boat will not go any faster than the desired speed. It locks the engine in at that rpm. Cruise control is also very safe because when pulling a rider there is a lot to have to worry about. Cruise control minuses one less worry allowing for a fun wakeboard run.|$|E
5000|$|The GM [...] "old-look" [...] bus was {{somewhat}} streamlined in appearance (resembling the PCC streetcar in styling), similar in shape to {{a loaf of}} sandwich bread, and had windows that were smaller than those found on more modern bus designs produced after the 1950s. Unlike most earlier buses, the GM [...] "old-look" [...] bus was built using a monocoque design, rather than a body-on-frame design, and it helped shepherd the change from gasoline to diesel-powered buses. Most [...] "old-look" [...] buses were powered with the Detroit Diesel 6-71 inline six-cylinder diesel engine, the exceptions being the shorter models that were powered by the four-cylinder {{version of the same}} diesel engine, and buses that were equipped with gasoline engines. Manual and automatic transmissions were available, with the Spicer angle-drive two-speed transmission being used on automatic-equipped buses built prior to 1948. After 1948, the 2-speed Allison <b>V-drive</b> transmission was used on automatic-equipped buses. In 1940 and 1942, a small number of buses were built with electric propulsion systems instead of a transmission. The [...] "old-look" [...] was available in several lengths ranging from 25 ft to 41 ft, though the most common models were 35 ft and 40 ft feet long. Most [...] "old-look" [...] buses were 96 in wide, but 102 in models were available beginning in 1948. In 1946 GM began offering its Thermo-matic heating and ventilation system, and in 1952 started making suburban models (identifiable by larger passenger windows, and equipped with high-backed forward-facing seats and optional luggage racks). Beginning in 1953, air-ride suspension became standard on all but the smallest model buses, and in 1958, air conditioning was added as an available option.|$|E
50|$|The main {{events of}} the game itself revolve around an {{original}} timeline again completely independent of all other featured series. In this timeline humanity has expanded beyond the Solar system, with planet Area becoming one of those resulting colonies. But {{somewhere along the line}} the Seasons, androids originally built to help the colonists settling on Area, rebelled against their human companions. Leading a robotic army collectively known as the Icon, the Seasons successfully wiped out the humans on planet Area, but there is one last trick up the colonists' sleeves: they made a data copy {{out of one of the}} Seasons androids and entrusted it, named Autumn-4, with genetic seeds of themselves as well as a trans-atmospheric battleship Ark Alpha. The intention was for Autumn-4 to take the gene seeds as far away from the Seasons' grip as possible so that the now-deceased colonists can be reborn on a safe world. Soon after commencement of Autumn-4's mission, however, Ark Alpha was intercepted by a fleet of Icon warships led by Winter-1, head of the Seasons. Overwhelmed by the numerically-superior enemies and in desperation, Autumn-4 activated a device within Ark Alpha called <b>V-Drive,</b> which has the ability to create a blackhole-like portal to parallel universes: it worked, with Brunhilde emerging from the portal and repulsing the Icon fleet, but also unintentionally caused characters from other timelines to be transported to planet Area as well. To make the matter worse, the energy discharged by Brunhilde in the process affected Autumn-4's memory circuits and corrupted her record of the event, leaving her unable to explain to all the people who now find themselves stranded in a foreign universe as to what has transpired.|$|E
