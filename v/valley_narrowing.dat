60|$|The {{appearance}} of a place in which the remainder of one's life is to be past is always noted with interest on a first visit. Thus it was that Mrs. Willoughby had been observant and silent {{from the moment the}} captain informed her that they had passed the line of his estate, and were approaching the spot where they were to dwell. The stream was so small, and the girding of the forest so close, that there was little range for the sight; but the anxious wife and mother could perceive that the hills drew together, at this point, the <b>valley</b> <b>narrowing</b> essentially, that rocks began to appear in the bed of the river, and that the growth of the timber indicated fertility and a generous soil.|$|E
50|$|On its course, {{the river}} travels north {{from the core}} Alaska Range as a braided river, {{becoming}} rapid and narrow as it traverses through the Primrose Ridge, braiding again through the Stampede Trail <b>valley,</b> <b>narrowing</b> again through the Tekla Ridge before ultimately meandering through a complex series of oxbow turns and lakes across the southern Tanana River valley.|$|E
60|$|After a long day's {{work the}} caravan halted {{for the night}} at the spot where the <b>valley</b> <b>narrowed</b> to the ravine.|$|R
50|$|The upper {{course of}} the river flows through a typical glacial U-shaped <b>valley.</b> The <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> at the lower part and forms a canyon.|$|R
50|$|The {{designated}} use for Sand Spring Run is aquatic life. A road {{known as}} State Route 1010 (White Deer Pike Road/Sugar <b>Valley</b> <b>Narrows</b> Road) flows alongside the stream, as does Interstate 80.|$|R
50|$|The {{lower part}} of the <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> down in the gorge between Akuliarusiarsuk ridge in the north, and Qaarsorsuaq ridge in the south, which {{separates}} the valley from lake Tasersuatsiaq and the Ammalortup Nunaa highland beyond.|$|R
5000|$|Madseit (...) {{lies beyond}} {{the village of}} Juns and is a small {{settlement}} with several hotels, boarding houses and private homes. The <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> then behind the little hamlet, at {{the confluence of the}} Madseitbach and the Tuxerbach.|$|R
60|$|Below this grassy summit yawned a <b>valley,</b> <b>narrow</b> and long, losing {{itself by}} turns to distant east and west; {{and through it}} ran a faint, white, winding line which was the old St. Vrain and Laramie Trail.|$|R
50|$|The <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> {{north and}} south to about 4 mi, but widens at the {{floodplain}} of the Humboldt River. The center of the valley is approximately just southwest of Clear Creek Ranch at the west foothills of the Sonoma Range.|$|R
60|$|A {{little higher}} up the <b>valley</b> <b>narrowed</b> again, the sides came closer and closer, until they closed in {{abruptly}} in a rounded precipice, down {{which in the}} wet season {{it was evident that}} a waterfall leaped from a height above.|$|R
50|$|Upon exiting Briar Creek Township, Little Shickshinny Creek enters Salem Township, Luzerne County. Here, {{it turns}} {{northeast}} and its <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> slightly. After {{a few more}} miles, the creek reaches the borough of Shickshinny, where it reaches its confluence with Shickshinny Creek.|$|R
50|$|Two {{miles south}} of Rousham the river is crossed by a medieval {{packhorse}} bridge at Northbrook and a further mile south the course of Akeman Street, a Roman road, crosses the river. South of here, the Cherwell <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> and becomes more wooded.|$|R
5000|$|After Bleidenstadt the <b>valley</b> <b>narrows,</b> and the Aar {{reaches its}} southernmost point {{and turns to}} the northwest. In Bad Schwalbach its only nameworthy left tributary, Nesselbach, enters into it, and it reaches the town's Adolfseck area. Shortly {{thereafter}} it crosses the Limes.|$|R
6000|$|... "We may get {{a couple}} of hundred yards more start before we are seen," [...] Harry said. [...] "Anyhow, we have got five hundred yards, and may reckon on making the two miles to where the <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> before they catch us." ...|$|R
50|$|The Briceville {{community}} {{is located at}} {{the upper end of the}} Coal Creek <b>Valley,</b> a <b>narrow</b> <b>valley</b> that slices between Walden Ridge and the rugged areas of the Cumberland Mountains.|$|R
50|$|Grass Valley trends north-northwest and is nestled {{between two}} {{mountain}} ranges on the Humboldt River's south. The East Range is southwest, the Sonoma Range is north-northeast. The <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> at its south-southeast {{with the north}} terminus hills of the Tobin Range meeting the Sonoma Range.|$|R
50|$|The {{north of}} the Avra <b>Valley</b> <b>narrows</b> at the Silver Bell Mountains and Marana to the east. The region merges into the wider flatlands {{associated}} with the floodplain regions of the northwestern Santa Cruz River where it begins to merge with the Gila River.|$|R
50|$|Skull <b>Valley</b> <b>narrows</b> southeastwards at the springs, as described. Bordering {{southwest}} here, is a southeast trending 16 mi long ridgeline {{from the}} west perimeter Cedar Mountains, which separates the Dugway Proving Grounds and the Great Salt Lake Desert region from the southwest Skull Valley.|$|R
5000|$|Yankee Run {{is located}} {{to the south}} of McCall Mountain and to the east of Hough Mountain. The stream is located near the Brush <b>Valley</b> <b>Narrows.</b> It was {{described}} in John Blair Linn's book History of Centre and Clinton Counties as a [...] "little stream".|$|R
50|$|After {{the hamlet}} of Ribes, the <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> along {{the course of}} the Biaysse {{to the bottom of the}} valley. Here, the soil is poor; {{avalanches}} and mudslides have covered the soil with rocks and gravel. The two little hamlets of Viollins and Mensals are situated in rare protected spots.|$|R
50|$|The <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> {{considerably}} between steep sandstone ridges {{after the}} river passes through Ashwood. The marina at Ashwood {{coincides with the}} descent of the Dawley Brook to join the Smestow. This confluence provided Roman soldiers with a natural moat to protect one of the forts, which are generally named after Greensforge.|$|R
50|$|From these plains, {{the road}} ascends rapidly to the 634-metre Hope Saddle. From here, the highway heads {{generally}} westward, along {{the valley of}} the Buller River and its tributaries. Beyond Murchison, this <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> to become the scenic Buller Gorge, and the highway twists its way high above the waters of the river.|$|R
50|$|The {{valley is}} {{approximately}} 45 mi long. At its widest, across from New Market Gap near Luray, {{the valley is}} about 10 mi wide, while at its narrowest north of Luray near Compton, it is only 3.25 mi. Similarly {{to the south of}} Luray, at Ingham, the <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> to 3.5 mi wide.|$|R
50|$|The <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> at {{the western}} end of the lake where it {{discharges}} into the Lower Humber River. This remaining part of the valley includes the local service district of Little Rapids, as well as the Humber Valley Golf Resort which is adjacent to the Marble Mountain Ski Resort, and the community of Steady Brook.|$|R
50|$|At about 500 km the <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> {{to about}} 50 km and becomes divided by a ridge into two {{parallel}} valleys, with a tributary, the Lukusashi River in a 25 km-wide valley to the north-west, and the Luangwa in a 15 km wide valley to the southeast. The river meanders less, and the flood plain narrows.|$|R
50|$|Rail : Nearest Railhead is at and Pathankot Cantt.- 24 km away, {{which is}} well {{connected}} by important trains {{from all the}} major cities, going to Jammu/Katra. Nurpur is blessed with narrow gaze train service (Pathankot/Jogindernagar) known as kangra valley rail. Travelling in Kangra <b>Valley</b> <b>narrow</b> gaze train is very charming and mesmerising passing through small mountains/bridges/villages.|$|R
50|$|The {{mainline}} {{follows the}} Pielach valley through Hofstetten-Grünau, Rabenstein an der Pielach, the main {{center in the}} valley, Kirchberg an der Pielach, {{and on to the}} station at Loich, which was once of special importance to freight operations. The tunnel further along was built with only the railway's own loading gauge in mind, making freight transport by transporter wagons impossible. From here, the <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> considerably, and shortly before the next station, Schwarzenbach an der Pielach, the line passes through the Weißenburgtunnel, thereby leaving the Pielach valley and coming out into the Nattersbach <b>valley,</b> which <b>narrows</b> rather like a gorge. The line reaches first Frankenfels, and then the station at Laubenbachmühle.|$|R
50|$|South Run {{begins in}} a broad valley near Hickory Knob in Monroe Township. It flows in a northerly {{direction}} for several tenths of a mile before turning northwest as its <b>valley</b> <b>narrows.</b> After several tenths of a mile, the stream turns north for several tenths of a mile before turning northwest and then north again. It then reaches its confluence with Bowman Creek.|$|R
2500|$|At Piotta, the Funicolare del Ritom ascends to the Ritom dam. Beyond Rodi-Fiesso, at an {{altitude}} of , the most impressive section of the southern ramp begins. The <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> to the Piotta canyon, and the line passes two spirals ("Piottino-Loops") to lose [...] in height before reaching Faido. Two more spirals, known as the [...] "Biaschina-Loops", lead the line down to Giornico, at {{an altitude}} of [...]|$|R
50|$|A {{trail from}} the parking area {{consists}} of the old ranch road along Mills Creek. After a mile it passes a 1930s bungalow {{that serves as a}} park residence. The <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> between steep chaparral-covered hills. The terrain is navigable for another mile above the Mills Barn and water tanks, until the trail fades into the dense growth of stinging nettles, poison oak, and coyote brush.|$|R
50|$|Below Cherneta the Jhimruk loops east, {{becoming}} {{the border between}} Pyuthan and Arghakhanchi District. Its <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> and steepens as it enters the Mahabharat Range. Partway through it joins the Mardi and the combined flow is then named the Rapti. The main river emerges from its gorge into the lower Siwalik Hills and Dang District. At Bhalubang Bazaar Nepal's east-west Mahendra Highway bridges the river.|$|R
50|$|The Skull Valley Indian Reservation {{is located}} in the valley's south at the {{southwest}} foothills of the Stansbury Mountains; adjacent southeast, the <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> between the Stansbury Mountains, and the Cedar Mountains at west, a region of creeks from the Stansburys and valley springs, Willow Patch Springs and Scribner Spring. Creeks and springs from the northwest Onaqui Mountains also feed the southeast valley region.|$|R
5000|$|Joginder Nagar or Jogindar Nagar (...) is a {{municipal}} council and an administrative subdivision in Mandi {{district in the}} Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. Named after Raja Joginder Sen, the hill station is terminal point of 163 km long Kangra <b>Valley</b> <b>Narrow</b> gauge railhead. Joginder Nagar is the only town in Asia to have three hydro-electric power stations, and hence nicknamed The City of Powerhouses.|$|R
5|$|North from Long Valley Junction, US-89 descends {{through the}} valley of the Sevier River, meeting SR-12, a scenic highway that leads to Bryce Canyon National Park, at Bryce Canyon Junction, SR-143 in Panguitch, and SR-20 at Bear Valley Junction. As the highway {{continues}} north, the <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> significantly into the Circleville Canyon before opening out near the town of Circleville. In this part of the valley, the Sevier River is dammed to create the Piute Reservoir, and US-89 meets SR-62 near Kingston. North of Marysvale, the <b>valley</b> again <b>narrows</b> into the Sevier Canyon, which carries the river to its confluence with Clear Creek and US-89 to its overlap with Interstate 70, beginning at Sevier.|$|R
50|$|Having {{passed through}} Re the <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> and the torrent begins {{to run through}} {{restricted}} gorges, entering in this manner Swiss territory, where it is known simply as the Melezza. Its course then runs through the Centovalli and the municipalities of Borgnone, Palagnedra and Intragna. Having been joined by its most important tributary, the Isorno, it flows into the Maggia at Losone, just before the Maggia enters Lago Maggiore.|$|R
50|$|The southeasterly {{excursion}} of {{the valley}} {{is caused by the}} bordering Big Hatchet Mountains on the southwest, which trend southeast; the <b>valley</b> <b>narrows</b> here, between the Apache Hills northeast, to between 5 and 7 mi wide. In the northwest where the valley widens, the Little Hatchet Mountains lie on the west perimeter. The site of Old Hachita is on the Little Burro's northeast; Playas, NM lies on the northwest.|$|R
