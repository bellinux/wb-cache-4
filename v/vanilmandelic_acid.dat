50|$|Pups that {{underwent}} prenatal stress showed lower plasma testosterone {{when compared}} to the control pups. This is caused by the disruption of prenatal development which did not allow the complete masculinization of the prenatally stressed pups’ central nervous system. Particularly in the striatum of the prenatally stressed male pups showed an increase in <b>vanilmandelic</b> <b>acid,</b> dopamine, serotonin, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid which all can affect sexual behavior. The prenatally stressed male pups showed a significant latency in mounting behavior {{when compared to}} controls.When doing the radial arm maze task prenatally stressed male rats showed a greater increase in dopamine than the prenatally stressed females, which is suggested to facilitate the impairment for the males doing the maze task, but improved the female’s performance. There was also an effect on the corticosterone secretion for prenatally stressed females. Being prenatally stressed increased the anxiety response of the female rats. Yet, it had no effect on the males.|$|E
40|$|Summary: A {{method was}} {{developed}} for the simultaneous determination of urinary <b>vanilmandelic</b> <b>acid</b> and homo-vanillic acid, which included a two step prepurifteation and a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with amperometric detection.

The method was linear between 2. 5 and 100 / <b>vanilmandelic</b> <b>acid</b> and homovanillic acid with good precision (CV always less than 10 %). The correlation between the present determination of vanilmandelic aciä and the procedure ofPisano et al. ((1962) Clin. Chim. Acta 7, 285 ^ 291) was very göod (r = 0. 931).

The latter consistently accounts for some 18 - 20 % of the administered -dopa dose. While <b>vanilmandelic</b> <b>acid</b> excretions even under the influence of -dopa correlate well with the patients' weight, no such correlation could be obtained with homovanillic acid.

Twelve pairs each of monozygotic and dizygotic twins were studied. Blood pressure, pulse rate, catecholamine excretion, and free fatty acid (FFA) levels were measured before and after administration of two stimuli—a frustrating mental exercise (the Stroop color test) and ischemic pain to the arm.

To reduce the invasiveness of surgery, new techniques have been recently proposed, such as mini-laparoscopy, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, and laparoendoscopic single site surgery (LESS). Herein, we describe one case of adrenalectomy by retroperitoneal LESS using conventional laparoscopic instruments and ports. Case Report: A 52 -year-old female patient with an incidental finding of a 3 -cm mass in the left adrenal was referred to us.

40|$|Although {{autonomic}} dysfunction is {{a common}} manifestation of Guillain-Barré syndrome, cardiovascular involvement in this setting has rarely {{been reported in the}} literature. We describe a case of reversible left ventricular systolic dysfunction in a 60 -year-old man with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Our patient had no history or signs of cardiac dysfunction on initial presentation. During the clinical manifestation of his autonomic dysfunction, he developed electrocardiographic changes accompanied by mildly elevated cardiac enzymes and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction and segmental wall motion abnormality, which coincided with elevated urinary catecholamine and <b>vanilmandelic</b> <b>acid</b> levels. These abnormalities, and his symptoms, resolved rapidly once the acute episode was over. We believe the reversible left ventricular dysfunction was due to the toxic effect of increased catecholamines and to the transiently damaged sympathetic nerve endings in the myocardium, presumably a consequence of Guillain-Barré syndrome. We recommend that echocardiography be performed in patients with clinical signs of autonomic dysfunction, especially if they are associated with abnormal electrocardiographic findings, cardiac enzyme elevation, or hemodynamic instability, so that appropriate medical therapy can be instituted in a timely manner...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Paragangliomas {{are rare}} tumors origined on chromaffin-cells of neural crest {{and can be}} located from skull base to pelvis, on {{sympathetic}} or parasympathetic paraganglia. They account on less than 0, 06 % of all urinary bladder tumors, with only few hundreds of cases reported in literature since the first record by Zimmermmann in 1953. Case Report: A 63 year-old woman referring irritative urinary symptoms was submitted to an ultrassonography that disclosed an irregular-shaped nodulation on her bladder. CT confirmed {{the existence of a}} nodulation on bladder's anterior wall. Patient had normal levels of urinary catecholamins and <b>Vanilmandelic</b> <b>acid.</b> Tumor was excised and posterior immunohistochemical study revealed it was a paraganglioma. Nowadays, ten months after surgery, patient stills healthy and disease-free. Discussion: Paragangliomas can be classified as functionant or non-functionant, according to its production of cathecolamins, which can cause the same symptom complex of pheocromocytomas. About 10 - 15 % of bladder paragangliomas are malignant, and potential metastasis are more common to lymph nodes, lungs and bones. 131 -MIBG iodine cyntilography is the most sensitive method for diagnosis and surgery (transurethral resection or cystectomy) is the best choice for treatment...|$|E
40|$|IN {{previous}} studies we demonstrated that tolbutamide administered {{in patients with}} occlusive cerebral infarct induces a long-lasting fall in blood sugar which is seldom noticed in controls (Stoica, 1969). Besides, unlike controls, such patients did not develop hyperfibrinolysis to emotional stress (Stoica and Cherciulescu, 1965). As is known, stress states are accompanied by an overt activation of the sympathetico-adrenal system. A state of stress, whether due to emotion (von Euler et al., 1959; Levi, 1967), gravitation (Goodall, 1962), cold (Klepping et al, 1957; Leduc, 1961) or to hypoglycaemia (Goldfien et al., 1961) raises the blood catecholamines and their urinary excretion rate. A higher urinary excretion of <b>vanilmandelic</b> <b>acid</b> (VMA), the main metabolite of catecholamines, was also reported during emotional (Nestel et al., 1967) or hypoglycaemic (v. Studnitz and Hanson, 1959) states. On the other hand, catecholamines are a factor of control of the blood sugar level, by their hyper-glycaemic effect (Antonis et al., 1967; Altszuler et al., 1967) and of mobilization of the fibrinolytic system (Biggs et al., 1947; Genton et al., 1961).

40|$|Methocarbamol, {{a widely}} {{prescribed}} muscle relaxant, gives a positive result for increased <b>vanilmandelic</b> <b>acid</b> excretion with the useful screening test devised by Gitlow {{for evidence of}} pheochromocytoma.

I N PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA, 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxy-rnandelic acid (VMA), a metabolite of epinephrine and norepinephrine, is excreted in urine in abnormally large quantities. Qitlow et al.

40|$|Objective: Amine {{precursor}} uptake and decarboxylation is {{a classical}} feature of gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Production of catecholamines was studied in GEP NET and non-NET patients. Design: A cross-sectional study was undertaken. Methods: We studied catecholamine and metabolite secretion in 115 consecutive GEP NET patients and in 20 patients with non-NET. After specific extraction, <b>vanilmandelic</b> <b>acid,</b> homovanilic acid, catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine) and methoxylated derivates (metanephrine, normetanephrine, methoxytyramine) in urinary extracts {{were analyzed by}} high performance liquid chromatography. Results were indexed to the 24 -h urinary creatinine levels. Results: Among the 115 patients with NET, 9 (8 %) had an increase {{of at least one}} urinary catecholamine or metabolite; in 7 out of the 9 the increase was slight being less than twice the upper value of the normal range. Elevated urinary dopamine (3 patients), methoxytyramine (6 patients), norepinephrine (2 patients) and normetanephrine (2 patients) were found. No increased urinary excretion of epinephrine nor metanephrine was observed. An adrenal mass existed in one of these nine patients but metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy was negative as was immunohisto-chemistry for epithelial markers. None of the 20 patients with non-NET demonstrated an increased excretion of catecholamine or metabolites. No relationships were found between catecholamine and metabolite excretions and patients ’ tumor and treatment characteristics. Conclusion: Production of catecholamines and metabolites is a rare event in GEP NET patients.

Neither chemical nor physical hormonal disorders were present. We carried out the radical surgical treatment by trans-thoracoabdominal approach under the diagnosis of left adrenal neuroblastoma. Pathological diagnosis was ganglioneuroblastoma. After the operation, the patient received both systemic chemotherapy of vincristine and cyclophosphamide and immunotherapy of OK- 432 by subcutaneous administration. Furthermore, 40 Gy of the regional irradiation of 60 Co to the operative space after the surgery was performed. At eight months after the operation, he is alive with no evidence of disease. Ganglioneuroblastoma is a neuroblastic tumor including neuroblastoma, which commonly occurs in childhood.

40|$|Background: The {{diagnosis}} of aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency, {{one of the}} pediatric neurotransmitter disorders, is classically made with plasma enzyme level or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurotransmitter profile, while both are technically demanding and the latter requires the invasive lumbar puncture. So far less than 100 cases have been reported worldwide with 20 % from Taiwan. It was postulated that the condition might have been under-diagnosed among Chinese populations and a non-invasive screening tool should be developed in areas with high prevalence. Methods: Urine metabolic profiles performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in a 31 -month period were retrospectively reviewed: those with <b>vanilmandelic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration lower than one percentile plus the presence of 3 -o-methyldopa were defined as positive and the patients were further evaluated. Results: Among 1046 metabolic profiles (from 845 patients) reviewed, 3 profiles from 2 patients were screened positive: both cases had compatible CSF neurotransmitter profiles and the diagnosis was further confirmed by genetic analysis of DDC gene. 13 negative urinary metabolic profiles from 7 patients who had CSF neurotransmitters analyzed were identified as controls: all 7 CSF neurotransmitter profiles were not compatible for AADC deficiency. Conclusions: The GC-MS-based urine metabolic profiling was {{shown to be a}} satisfactory screening tool for AADC deficiency. Further confirmation can be performed by mutation analysis in the DDC gene, thus avoiding risks of lumbar puncture.

Patients showed a clear increase in menstral tension symptoms in the week before menstruation, both during selection and during the study. In the group of control subjects, there was hardly any increase in average MDQ symptoms during the late lutoal phase. Diurnal urine and nocturnal urine were collected on days 5, 11, 17, 21. and 25 of the cycle. Blood was sampled from subjects in supine position through an intravenous (iv) catheter the morning after urine collection. Patients showed a higher tryptophan (Trp) and epinephrine (Epi) level in plasma, higher excretion of 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in urine and a larger volume of 24 -hr urine. Excretion of norepinephrine (NE) in 24 -hr urine showed a linear increase during the cycle, while excretion of dopamine (DA) showed a quadratic pattern, being lowest at day 17.

Such a difference between normal and elevated values means that quantitation need only discover the ele-vated values with significant confidence. VMA, {{which is one of the}} many hydroxy-phenol acids appearing in the urine, can be separated by electrophoresis. Methods developed by Hermann (2) and Klein et at. (3) require a prior extraction of the urine followed by colorimetric quantitation of the VMA eluted from the electrophoretic support. A direct method using paper electrophoresis (4) appears sensitive to 1. 0 g. of VMA. In the proposed electrophoretic method using cellulose acetate media, 1 /MA is detected at levels of 0. 1 g. when applying 0. 1 ml. of urine to the electrophoretic media; urine specimens containing 1 mg. /L. (0. 1 g. / 0. 1 ml.) can be easily recognized. Differences of 0. 3 g. equivalent to 3 mg. /L. can 1) e determined semiquantitatively. This precision is more than enough to detect abnormal from normal excretions...|$|E

Apresentamos o caso de um paciente de 11 anos com quadro de hipertensão {{arterial}} grave e massa em região cervical direita. Apresentou aumento das catecolaminas e metabólitos urinários: epinefrina, 97, 8 mg/ 24 hs (Valor de Referência (VR) = 0, 5 a 20); norepinefrina, 184, 8 mg/ 24 hs (VR= 15 a 80); dopamina, 513, 5 mg/ 24 hs (VR= 65 a 400); metanefrina, 0, 08 mg/g de creatinina (VR Functioning paragangliomas {{are rare}} tumors originated from the neural crest cells that produce catecholamines. We present {{the case of}} an 11 year-old boy with severe arterial hypertension and a mass in the right cervical region. He presented increased levels of catecholamine and urinary fractions of epinephrine, 97. 8 mg/ 24 hs (Reference Values (RV) = 0. 5 to 20); norepinephrine, 184. 8 mg/ 24 hs (RV= 15 to 80); dopamine, 513. 5 mg/ 24 hs (RV= 65 to 400); metanephrine, 0. 08 mg/g creatinine (RV< 0. 31); normetanephrine, 0. 64 mg/g creatinine (RV< 0. 43); <b>vanilmandelic</b> <b>acid,</b> 69. 3 mmol/ 24 hs (RV= 10 to 35). Scintigraphy with metaiodinebenzylguanidine (MIBG) showed increased uptake in the right cervical mass, which was confirmed by magnetic resonance image (MRI), which also showed a small mass in the left cervical region without increased MIBG uptake. A surgical procedure removed the right cervical lesion, normalizing blood pressure, catecholamine levels and urinary fractions. Immunohistochemistry was positive for neurospecific enolase, neurofilaments, cromogranin, somatostatin and serotonin that confirmed the diagnosis of a functioning paraganglioma and also identified the presence of anti-S 100 protein, which is a predictor for good prognosis. The patient will be followed with periodic clinical and laboratory exams due to the mass in the left cervical region and to detect any possible relapse of the tumor. Despite the presence of good prognostic factors these tumors are considered potentially malignant...|$|E
40|$|Aromatic l-aminoacid decarboxylase (AADC) {{deficiency}} is a neurotransmitter defect {{leading to}} a combined deficiency of catecholamines and serotonin. Patients are usually detected in infancy due to developmental delay, hypotonia, and extrapyramidal movements. Diagnosis {{is based on an}} abnormal neurotransmitter metabolite profile in CSF and reduced AADC activity in plasma. An elevation of vanillactic acid (VLA) has been described as the only abnormality detected in organic acid analysis (OA) of urine. We report a patient who presented in the neonatal period with lethargy, hypotonia, metabolic acidosis, and hypoglycemia. Blood ammonia, lactic acid, and acylcarnitines were normal, but OA of a urine sample showed a small increase of VLA, raising the suspicion of AADC deficiency. The patient was lost to follow-up until the age of 8 months, when he presented with dystonia, abnormal movements, oculogyric crises, and hypothermia. Repeat OA showed not only increased levels of VLA, but also increased vanilpyruvic acid (VPA), N-acetyl-vanilalanine (AVA) and N-acetyl-tyrosine (NAT). Neurotransmitter analysis in CSF showed increased vanilalanine (1200 nmol/L, ref < 100) with decreased levels of 5 -hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA, < 5 nmol/L; ref 152 - 462), homovanillic acid (HVA, 83 nmol/L; ref 302 - 845), and methoxy-hydroxy-phenyl-glycol (< 5 nmol/L; ref 51 - 112). AADC activity in plasma was nearly undetectable. In the urine, low excretion of <b>vanilmandelic</b> <b>acid</b> (< 0. 3 micromol/mmol creat; ref 0. 3 - 20) and 5 -HIAA (0. 9 micromol/mmol creat; ref 4 - 18), was found, but HVA was normal and dopamine even elevated. This contradictory phenomenon of hyperdopaminuria has been described earlier in AADC deficient patients. We postulate that VPA and AVA could originate from vanilalanine (through a transaminase and an acetylase respectively), while NAT could originate from tyrosine through an AA acetylase. This report expands the clinical presentation of AADC deficiency and adds new markers of the disease for OA analysis, improving detection of AADC deficient patients in general metabolic screening procedure...|$|E
