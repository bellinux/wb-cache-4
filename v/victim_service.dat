25|$|Title VI {{amended the}} Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (VOCA) {{to change how}} the U.S. Victims of Crime Fund was managed and funded, {{improving}} the speedy provision of aid to families of public safety officers by expedited payments to officers or the families of officers injured or killed {{in the line of}} duty. Payments must be made no later than 30 days later. The Assistant Attorney General was given expanded authority under Section 614 of the U.S.A. P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act to make grants to any organization that administers any Office of Justice Programs, which includes the Public Safety Officers Benefits Program. Further changes to the Victims of Crime Fund increased the amount of money in the Fund and changed the way that funds were distributed. The amount available for grants made through the Crime Victim Fund to eligible crime victim compensation programs were increased from 40 percent to 60 percent of the total in the Fund. A program can provide compensation to U.S. citizens who were adversely affected overseas. Means testing was also waived for those who apply for compensation. Under VOCA, the Director may make an annual grant from the Crime Victims Fund to support crime victim assistance programs. An amendment was made to VOCA to include offers of assistance to crime victims in the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and any other U.S. territory. VOCA also provides for compensation and assistance to victims of terrorism or mass violence. This was amended to allow the Director to make supplemental grants to States for eligible crime victim compensation and assistance programs, and to <b>victim</b> <b>service</b> organizations, public agencies (including Federal, State, or local governments) and non-governmental organizations that provide assistance to victims of crime. The funds could be used to provide emergency relief, including crisis response efforts, assistance, compensation, training and technical assistance for investigations and prosecutions of terrorism.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an outline of the {{strengths}} and weaknesses of selected models of police-based <b>victim</b> <b>services.</b> It aims to provide an overview of the current predominant models of police-based victim support in the USA, Canada, UK and Australia. It also aims to advance a typology of police-based <b>victim</b> <b>services</b> as a useful analytic tool for understanding the varying models. Design/methodology/approach – The research was based on extensive documentary analysis supplemented by semi-structured interviews with 17 practitioners in the USA, Canada and Australia. Sites were selected for interview based on documentary research which indicated that they had developed police-based <b>victim</b> <b>services</b> in their organization that were either particularly representative or innovative. Findings – Police-based <b>victim</b> <b>services</b> can be categorized into three broad models: unit services, dedicated liaison officer services, and referral services. Each model has strengths and weaknesses in terms of service delivery and police organization. Unit services may be optimum in delivering services but are also resource-intensive and may be beyond the financial scope of some police organizations. They also potentially risk sequestering <b>victim</b> <b>services</b> within police organizations and reinforcing a view that dealing with victims of crime is not “real policing”. Dedicated officer services require significant institutional input to achieve their goals, while referral models necessitate workable mechanisms for inter-agency cooperation. Thus police organizations need a clear perception of their <b>victim</b> <b>services</b> delivery role and how this might best be achieved. Originality/value – The academic literature on police-based <b>victim</b> <b>services</b> remains scant. This paper makes a valuable contribution to the literature by providing a useful typology for the analysis of police-based <b>victim</b> <b>services</b> and the assessment of their strengths and weaknesses. The typology will prove useful for future empirical case-studies of individual police-based <b>victim</b> <b>services.</b> Keywords Police, <b>Victim</b> <b>services,</b> <b>Victims</b> of crime, Comparative policing, Australia, United States of America, Canada, United Kingdom, Modelling Paper type Research pape...|$|R

The main theme that emerged from participants’ stories centred {{on the experience of}} invisibility, where participants described feeling unheard, unseen, and unacknowledged in their interactions with the <b>victim</b> <b>services</b> system and with individuals working within it. In contrast, they often described helpful experiences as those where they felt supported and acknowledged.

50|$|In 1975, a {{pilot program}} began in New York City's court system that {{addressed}} the need to assist criminal court witnesses who had been intimidated or who felt too threatened to testify in court. Three years later, that pilot program became the <b>Victim</b> <b>Services</b> Agency, offering a broader array of services that helped more victims of crime and abuse. Lucy N. Friedman was Safe Horizon's founding executive director. By 1981, the <b>Victim</b> <b>Services</b> Agency provided programs for victims of domestic violence, offering them shelter, counseling, and concrete support. Over the next three decades, the <b>Victim</b> <b>Services</b> Agency incorporated various other programs to assist {{victims and their families}} during times of crisis.

50|$|The Victims of Crime Act {{provides}} for compensation and assistance {{to victims of}} terrorism or mass violence. This was amended by section 624 of the Patriot Act to allow the Director to make supplemental grants to States for eligible crime victim compensation and assistance programs, and to <b>victim</b> <b>service</b> organizations, public agencies (including Federal, State, or local governments) and nongovernmental organizations that provide assistance to victims of crime. The funds {{could be used to}} provide emergency relief, including crisis response efforts, assistance, compensation, training and technical assistance for investigations and prosecutions of terrorism. It removed the restrictions on providing such grants to those who are not eligible for compensation under title VIII of the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 (also known as the Victims of Terrorism Compensation Act). However, any use of the emergency reserve set aside for response to acts of terrorism is to be reduced by any amount that was given to the victim under the Victims of Terrorism Compensation Act.|$|E

In 2009 A21 opened a crisis shelter for victims in Thessaloniki and works with the Greek government to assist trafficking victims. The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs works closely with the NGO “Smile of a Child” to implement an amber alert program aimed at helping trafficked missing children. The Greek NGO “KEPAD” (Human Rights Defense Center) works {{to establish and maintain}} a network or anti-trafficking NGOs in the Balkan region that work cooperatively to combat trafficking. NGOs, some of whom received government funding, reported assisting at least 3,376 trafficking victims in 2009, significantly more than the 125 victims identified by the government.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Anti-Stalking Training Evaluation Protocol (ASTEP) was {{developed}} to provide Safe Horizon, a large <b>victim</b> <b>service</b> provider, {{with an opportunity to}} evaluate and improve its anti-stalking training program. This report presents the results of this effort to measure Safe Horizon staff’s knowledge and general perceptions about stalking, and {{to assess the impact of}} anti-stalking training on knowledge about the anti-stalking law, and stalking in general. Although these trainees appeared familiar with stalking issues, they were able to benefit from information about different types of stalkers and stalking, and about the legal options available to victims. The implication of the findings is that, if relatively well-informed staff members of a large victim services agency can benefit from training about stalking behavior, anti-stalking legislation and the needs of stalking victims, there is almost certainly a need for such training among a wider population of <b>victim</b> <b>service</b> providers, law enforcement professionals, and the general public...|$|E
