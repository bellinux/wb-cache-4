The degree of privacy provided by an analog voice scrambling technique, however, is proportional to the number of time and frequency elements into which the voice signal can be divided {{as well as to the}} number of permutation patterns according to which the elements are scrambled. This implies the requirement for a high degree of signal-processing capability. Microprocessorbased implementations of an analog voice scrambling device provide a large potential for signal processing and scrambling. Furthermore, they provide this potential at a reasonable cost, small volume and moderate power consumption. In addition, a single microprocessorbased analog <b>voice</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>device</b> can be configured in software to yield various degrees of privacy, depending on a particular use and circumstances. Also, a variety of auxiliary functions such as timing, code generation, synchronization and analog-to-digital conversion can be time-shared within the same microprocessor chip, thus minimizing the requirement for support hardware. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to provide an overview of the existing analog voice privacy techniques, and (2) to specifically outline the capabilities of the microprocessor-based analog voice privacy system design, with a particular emphasis on achieving an analog scrambled signal compatible with the 3 kHz nominal audio bandwidth of the existing radio and telephone channels. Also, workable algorithms used for microprocessor-based analog voice scrambling in frequency as well as in time domain are described. Tape recordings of the voice scrambled and recovered with these algorithms are presented for comparison...|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaIn many instances, {{the process}} of {{telemetering}} of scientific information {{must be accompanied by}} a voice conversation which either reveals the sequence of measurements or provides information as {{to the nature of the}} data gathered and/or transmitted. If such voice information can compromise the integrity of the telemetry data to an unauthorized interceptor, <b>voice</b> <b>privacy</b> equipment must be used along with the equipment used for transmission of the telemetry data. The recent developments in LSI technology provide a new capability to the design of voice encryption equipment. This is particularly true for the case where sophisticated analog encryption schemes must be employed to permit the encrypted voice information to be transmitted over the existing telephone and radio channels which are typically limited to a 3 KHz upper-frequency cutoff. This paper examines the recent developments in analog <b>voice</b> <b>privacy</b> equipment design, as indicated by the disclosures made in open literature by various manufacturers and evaluators of such equipment. Advances in the technology as well as in analytical definitions of analog <b>voice</b> <b>privacy</b> are discussed.

40|$|RF {{interference}} (RFI) {{has been}} {{and will continue to}} be a significant worry for GNSS users. This paper introduces several different types of RFI, categorizes them based upon the intent (if any) of the RFI transmitter, and then examines a relatively new and growing source of RFI: Personal <b>Privacy</b> <b>Devices</b> (PPDs) that aim to prevent people and vehicles from being tracked by GNSS within a limited area. Unfortunately, signals from PPDs are not well-controlled and can interfere with GNSS receivers several hundred meters away. The impact of PPDs on the GBAS reference station site at Newark Airport, New Jersey and the WAAS reference station at Leesburg, Virginia are illustrated. While GBAS ground station monitoring prevents PPDs from posing a significant integrity threat, PPDs can force the sudden loss of service and thus harm continuity and availability. The hardware and software modifications made to the Newark GBAS installation to reduce this impact are described, and the future benefits of more-flexible ground-station siting and GNSS modernization are also identified...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we present}} {{detection}} and mitigation algorithms against malicious and coordinated interference, custom tailored for maritime applications. Specifically, against multipath and {{radio frequency interference}} (RFI), such as continuous wave (CW), personal <b>privacy</b> <b>devices</b> (PPD) and additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) interferers, we developed a two-stage mitigation algorithm. It consists of a prewhitening approach, followed by a space-time adaptive Principle Component Analysis (PCA) beamformer that uses a compression method based on Canonical Components (CC) with a bank of signal matched correlators. The proposed algorithms are capable of suppressing strong RFI and separating highly correlated and even coherent multipath signals, thus achieving improved time-delay and pseudorange estimation performance for safety-critical applications. Furthermore, an additional algorithm has been developed to detect spoofing attacks. The derived scheme fuses the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of the satellites in view with positioning information and produces a measure {{of confidence in the}} case of such an attack. Finally, we evaluate and compare the algorithms in question with real data collected in a measurement campaign performed at DLR's maritime jamming testbed in the Baltic sea...|$|R
40|$|In digital {{beamforming}} receivers {{the tracking}} of satellite signals {{which have a}} similar direction of arrival like the interference source often lose lock. A very difficult and time consuming reacquisition is the consequence. Especially in scenarios with moving receivers or RFI sources, gradually all satellites might get lost due to the change of the directions of arrival between the satellite signals and the RFI source. In single antenna receivers a very similar effect {{can be observed in}} urban canyons. According to the movement of the receiver different parts in the receiver’s skyplot are obstructed due to buildings or other obstacles. Vector tracking is a well-known technique to improve the GNSS availability in such scenarios. This paper describes an approach to integrate a vector delay and frequency locked loop (VDFLL) in a digital beamforming receiver. The proposed architecture consists of a pre-correlation prewhitening module and a VDFLL with an integrated post-correlation eigenbeamformer. The architecture of this approach will be described in detail and the potential capabilities will be shown by the results of a measurement campaign with a personal <b>privacy</b> <b>device</b> jammer...|$|R

This paper presents a context-aware resource management approach for service oriented applications, {{which aims to}} handle the inherent dynamics of services and the network, and to provide end-to-end Quality-of-Service (QoS) in a secure way. To maintain <b>privacy,</b> <b>devices</b> and services are organized in virtual communities. Only authenticated users can access them. To cope with dynamics of services and the network, a cross-layer monitoring architecture is designed to gather dynamic resource utilization of the services. Accordingly, service coordination decisions {{can be adapted to}} provide desired QoS. Two novel services are designed. One is a device manager which runs on each device and has full control of services and their underlying resources. Another is a resource manager which anticipates the performance of both required services and the network through monitoring the QoS in diverse layers and also be aware of environment changes. A prototyping system VICSDA and a 3 D video streaming application are built to prove the feasibility of this approach. Concrete results showed that VICSDA is context-aware and can optimize the overall performance of service oriented applications in a secure way.

40|$|Personal <b>privacy</b> <b>devices</b> (PPDs) are {{low-cost}} jammers to mask GPS signals, so {{that the}} location of the host vehicle is not revealed to other parties. Although it is illegal to use PPDs in the United States, they are being used and have caused problems for other GPS users. This paper investigates the PPD impact on aviation users from the WAAS service perspective. Although PPD jammers on the ground cannot reach airplanes far in the air, PPDs can interfere ground-based WAAS reference stations. We conducted Montel-Carlo simulation on WAAS availability coverage based on real data retrieved from current WAAS reference stations. Our simulation results show that PPD jamming activity has had negligible impact on WAAS service due to redundancy and robustness of large number of WAAS reference stations. Aviation users rely on Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) for accuracy and integrity. WAAS augments GPS by transmitting error correction messages calculated from 38 WAAS reference stations (WRS) on the ground [4]. Figure 2 illustrates WAAS system architecture. Although airplanes flying in the sky are far from the PPD jammers on the ground, PPDs can potentially deteriorate aviation performance by interfering the WAAS reference stations on the ground. It is currently unknown how close an aircraft has to be to a jammer to be impacted, but there is a risk that a PPD right under the approach path could cause a loss of service not modeled in this paper...|$|R

Lowpower civilian GNSS jammers pose a growing threat {{to the integrity of}} GNSS timing and navigation, and the present effort develops various countermeasures for these devices. The use of illegal civilian GNSS jammers has grown in recent years out of concern for personal privacy, sometimes on the part of innocents, but often in support of unauthorized or illegal activities. These civilian jammers are commonly referred to as personal <b>privacy</b> <b>devices</b> (PPDs). The effects of these PPDs are not limited to the individual user; they disrupt GNSSenabled equipment in a radius of 100 m- 1000 m or more around each device. GNSS systems are being further integrated into many aspects of our society; therefore, the rise in PPD use portends trouble for various pieces of civilian infrastructure. PPD use can be discouraged through more rigorous enforcement of spectrum interference laws. These enforcement actions will require specially designed equipment, and in particular, algorithms to be run by that equipment: algorithms that detect, acquire, track, and geolocate these PPDs. Six contributions are made to the body of knowledge on PPDs and the model-based algorithms related to PPD signal detection, acquisition, and tracking, and to PPD geolocation. However, many of these contributions can be generalized to additional non-PPD signals. The first contribution is a survey of the signal characteristics of 18 different.
