500|$|In {{the opening}} chorale fantasia, [...] "" [...] (Ah God, look down from heaven), the melody of the chorale is sung by the alto in long notes as a cantus firmus, doubled by two oboes. Dürr calls it an {{exemplary}} cantus firmus motet, with each {{entrance of the}} chorale tune prepared by fugal entrances of the other <b>voices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same theme. The instruments double the voices, with the occasional exception of the continuo.

500|$|The BBC website {{called the}} episode [...] "One {{of the most}} memorable episodes, if not one of the greatest– the satire on youth {{counterculture}} is well handled, and Homer's flashback to his youth is fabulous."

500|$|In 1962 he {{attended}} an executive conference of African writers in English at the Makerere University College in Kampala, Uganda.

Among the topics of discussion {{was an attempt to}} determine whether the term African literature ought to include work from the diaspora, or solely that writing composed by people living within the continent itself. Achebe indicated that it was not [...] "a very significant question", and that scholars would do well to wait until a body of work were large enough to judge. Writing about the conference in several journals, Achebe hailed it as a milestone for the literature of Africa, and highlighted the importance of community among isolated <b>voices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> continent and beyond.|$|E
500|$|Even {{film critics}} who {{generally}} disliked the film tended to enjoy Scar's characterization and Irons' performance. Terrence Rafferty of The New Yorker wrote, [...] "Among the celebrity <b>voices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack, two performances stand out," [...] namely, [...] "Jeremy Irons, as the villainous lion Scar" [...] who [...] "does an elegant, funny George Sanders impersonation." [...] (Sanders himself had voiced Shere Khan for Disney in their 1967 version of The Jungle Book). Stephen Hunter of The Baltimore Sun described Irons' voice as [...] "plummy-rich with rancid irony." [...] Television Without Pitys Ethan Alter admitted to enjoying Scar, praising the character as [...] "a fantastic villain and {{easily the most}} fully realized of the film's characters, thanks both to Jeremy Irons' marvelously wicked vocal performance and some clever character flourishes {{on behalf of the}} animators." [...] David Denby of New York, who otherwise criticized the film, felt that [...] "Irons... sounds like he's having a better time than he's ever had in movies before." [...] In a rare lukewarm review, Anthony Quinn of The Independent felt that Irons' performance was too campy: [...] "more Liberace than George Sanders." ...|$|E

500|$|Making {{innovative}} use {{of technology}} while expanding the possibilities of recorded music, the Beatles urged experimentation by Martin and his recording engineers. Seeking ways to put chance occurrences to creative use, accidental guitar feedback, a resonating glass bottle, a tape loaded the wrong way round so that it played backwards – any of these might be incorporated into their music. Their desire to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers Norman Smith, Ken Townsend and Geoff Emerick, all contributed significantly to their records from Rubber Soul and, especially, Revolver onwards. Along with innovative studio techniques such as sound effects, unconventional microphone placements, tape loops, double tracking and vari-speed recording, the Beatles augmented their songs with instruments that were unconventional in rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the sitar in [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] and the swarmandal in [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever". They also used novel electronic instruments such as the Mellotron, with which McCartney supplied the flute <b>voices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] intro, and the clavioline, an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on [...] "Baby, You're a Rich Man".|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s, {{along with}} {{providing}} her voice for commercials, November also recorded pop {{songs on the}} radio. [...] She, Tony Orlando, and Toni Wine sang [...] "Candida", in a group surreptitiously entitled [...] "Dawn". Tony Orlando was a recording industry executive at the time, for a competing label, April-Blackwood. So to avoid a conflict, the group was entitled [...] "Dawn" [...] without Orlando's name. [...] However, the song became a major hit, along with its followup [...] "Knock Three Times" [...] (also featuring backup by November and Toni Wine). [...] To go on tour, Orlando then asked two other session singers, Telma Hopkins and Joyce Vincent Wilson, to become the official backup singers, in their own [...] "Dawn" [...] group, so they could tour as [...] Tony Orlando and Dawn, though the <b>voices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> songs of the original album were still of November and Toni Wine, not Hopkins and Vincent. A few years later, November was again on the charts {{as part of the}} group Wing and a Prayer Fife and Drum Corps, an assemblage of studio musicians put together by Harold Wheeler. They released two albums, with their biggest hit being a disco version of the 1926 song [...] "Baby Face". It reached #14 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in late 1976, and #12 in the UK.|$|E

[...] In 2000, The Squirrels released The Not So Bright Side of the Moon, which features a cover of the entire album. [...] The New York dub collective Easy Star All-Stars released Dub Side of the Moon in 2003 and Dubber Side of the Moon in 2010.

[...] A string quartet version of the album was released in 2004. [...] In 2009, The Flaming Lips released a track-by-track remake of the album in collaboration with Stardeath and White Dwarfs, and featuring Henry Rollins and Peaches as guest musicians. Industrial metal band Ministry called their seventh studio album Dark Side of the Spoon as a play of word to The Dark Side of the Moon with reference to heroin, as {{several members of the}} band suffered from long-term addiction to said substance at the time.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{consists}} of a simplistic concept [...] a One Direction recording session. In a November 2012 interview with MTV News, Arnell {{said he did not}} want to make it about anything more than that, [...] "When I first heard the track, the mix on it was so simple and so pure and you could hear all the qualities of the <b>voices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> track, I just wanted to come up with something that when the viewer watched it, it was almost like sitting there listening to the boys sing the track." [...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of the hardest things I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling as if One Direction are singing it right to you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of it. When you sit there watching it, it's almost like these little bits of eye contact [...] you really feel like the guys are singing it to you." ...|$|E
