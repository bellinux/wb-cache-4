5|$|Severe acute {{withdrawal}} {{symptoms such as}} delirium tremens and seizures rarely occur after 1-week post cessation of alcohol. The acute withdrawal phase {{can be defined as}} lasting between one and three weeks. In the period of 3–6 weeks following cessation increased anxiety, depression, as well as sleep disturbance, is common; fatigue and tension can persist for up to 5 weeks as part of the post-acute withdrawal syndrome; about a quarter of alcoholics experience anxiety and depression for up to 2 years. These post-acute {{withdrawal symptoms}} have also been demonstrated in animal models of alcohol dependence and withdrawal. A kindling effect also occurs in alcoholics whereby each subsequent withdrawal syndrome is more severe than the previous withdrawal episode; this is due to neuroadaptations which occur as a result of periods of abstinence followed by re-exposure to alcohol. Individuals who have had multiple withdrawal episodes are more likely to develop seizures and experience more severe anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol than alcohol-dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol withdrawal episodes. The kindling effect leads to persistent functional changes in brain neural circuits as well as to gene expression. Kindling also results in the intensification of psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. There are decision tools and questionnaires which help guide physicians in evaluating alcohol withdrawal. For example, the CIWA-Ar objectifies alcohol withdrawal symptoms in order to guide therapy decisions which allows for an efficient interview {{while at the same time}} retaining clinical usefulness, <b>validity,</b> <b>and</b> <b>reliability,</b> ensuring proper care for withdrawal patients, who can be in danger of death.|$|E

40|$|AIMS: {{to perform}} the {{cultural}} adaptation of the STAR Skin Tear Classification System into the Portuguese language and to test the content <b>validity</b> <b>and</b> inter-rater <b>reliability</b> of the adapted version. METHODS: methodological study with a quantitative approach. The cultural adaptation was developed in three phases: translation, evaluation by a committee of judges and back-translation. The instrument was tested regarding content <b>validity</b> <b>and</b> inter-rater <b>reliability.</b> RESULTS: the adapted version obtained a regular level of concordance when it was applied by nurses using photographs of friction injuries. Regarding its application in clinical practice, the adapted version obtained a moderate and statistically significant level of concordance. CONCLUSION: the study tested the content <b>validity</b> <b>and</b> inter-rater <b>reliability</b> of the version adapted into the Portuguese language. Its inclusion in clinical practice will enable the correct identification {{of this type of}} injury, as well as the implementation of protocols for the prevention and treatment of friction injuries...|$|R
25|$|Many {{hospitals}} use the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA) protocol {{in order}} to assess the level of withdrawal present and therefore the amount of medication needed. When overuse of alcohol is suspected but drinking history is unclear, testing for elevated values of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin or gammaglutamyl transferase can help make the diagnosis of alcohol overuse and dependence more clear. The CIWA has also been shortened (now called the CIWA-Ar), while retaining its <b>validity</b> <b>and</b> <b>reliability,</b> to help assess patients more efficiently due to the life-threatening nature of alcohol withdrawal.|$|E

2500|$|It was paralleled {{similarly}} by {{work on the}} epidemiology {{of autism}} that was to enormously {{increase the number of}} children diagnosed with autism in future years. Although attention had been given in the 1960s and '70s to the classification of childhood psychiatric disorders, and some issues had then been delineated, such as the distinction between neurotic and conduct disorders, the nomenclature did not parallel the growing clinical knowledge. It was claimed that this situation was altered in the late 1970s with the development of the DSM-III system of classification, although research has shown that this system of classification has problems of <b>validity</b> <b>and</b> <b>reliability.</b> Since then, the DSM-IV and DSM-IVR have altered some of the parsing of psychiatric disorders into [...] "childhood" [...] and [...] "adult" [...] disorders, on the basis that while many psychiatric disorders are not diagnosed until adulthood, they may present in childhood or adolescence (DSM-IV).|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to add {{to our understanding of the}} antecedents of customer satisfaction by examining the effects of service reliability (Is the service “correctly” produced?) <b>and</b> service <b>validity</b> (Is the “correct” service produced?) of search, experience and credence services. Design/methodology/approach – Service <b>validity</b> <b>and</b> service <b>reliability</b> were manipulated in scenarios describing service encounters with different types of services. Customer satisfaction was measured using questionnaires. Findings – Service <b>validity</b> <b>and</b> service <b>reliability</b> independently affect customer satisfaction with search services. For experience services, service <b>validity</b> <b>and</b> service <b>reliability</b> are necessary conditions for customer satisfaction. For credence services, no effects of service validity were found but the effects of service reliability on customers' satisfaction were profound. Research limitations/implications – Scenarios provided a useful method to investigate customer evaluation of different types of service situations. A limitation of this method was that the participants were not observed in a real service situation but had to give their opinion on hypothetical scenarios. Practical implications – For search and credence services, it is possible to compensate low service validity by providing a highly reliable service. However, managers of experience services should be aware that little can be gained when either service validity or service reliability is faulty. Originality/value – The present study provides empirical data on the effects of service <b>reliability</b> <b>and</b> the thus far neglected effects of service <b>validity</b> <b>and</b> integrates these (new) concepts in the model of information verification...|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{advantages}} of standardized testing is that {{the results can be}} empirically documented; therefore, the test scores can be shown to have a relative degree of <b>validity</b> <b>and</b> <b>reliability,</b> as well as results which are generalizable and replicable. This is often contrasted with grades on a school transcript, which are assigned by individual teachers. [...] It may be difficult to account for differences in educational culture across schools, difficulty of a given teacher's curriculum, differences in teaching style, and techniques and biases that affect grading. [...] This makes standardized tests useful for admissions purposes in higher education, where a school is trying to compare students from across the nation or across the world. Examples of such international benchmark tests include the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS) and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS). Performance on these exams have been speculated to change based on the way standards like the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) line up with top countries across the world.|$|E

There are criticisms of the medical model approach from within and without the psychiatric profession (see references): it is said to neglect the role of environmental, family, and cultural influences, to discount the psychological meaning of behavior and symptoms, to promote a view of the [...] "patient" [...] as dependent and needing to be cured or cared for and therefore undermines a sense of personal responsibility for conduct and behavior, to promote a normative conception based on adaptation to the norms of society (the ill person must adapt to society), and {{to be based on the}} shaky foundations of reliance on a classificatory system that has been shown to have problems of <b>validity</b> <b>and</b> <b>reliability</b> (Boorse, 1976; Jensen, 2003; Sadler et al. 1994; Timimi, 2006).|$|E
