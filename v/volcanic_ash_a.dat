40|$|Abstract. An {{algorithm}} is presented for {{the estimation of}} volcanic ash plume top height using the stereo view of the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) aboard Envisat. The {{algorithm is}} based on matching top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectances and brightness tempera-tures of the nadir and 55 ◦ forward views, and using the result-ing parallax to obtain the height estimate. Various retrieval parameters are discussed in detail, several quality parameters are introduced, and post-processing methods for screening out unreliable data have been developed. The method is com-pared to other satellite observations and in situ data. The pro-posed algorithm {{is designed to be}} fully automatic and can be implemented in operational retrieval algorithms. Combined with automated ash detection using the brightness tempera-ture difference between the 11 and 12 µm channels, the algo-rithm allows efficient simultaneous retrieval of the horizontal and vertical dispersion of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash.</b> <b>A</b> case study on the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull in 2010 is presented. ...|$|E

40|$|WARIS is an {{in-house}} multi-purpose framework focused on solving scientific problems using Finite Difference Methods as numerical scheme. Its framework was designed from scratch to solve {{in a parallel}} and efficient way Earth Science and Computational Fluid Dynamic problems {{on a wide variety}} of architectures. WARIS uses structured meshes to discretize the problem domains, as these are better suited for optimization in accelerator-based architectures. To succeed in such challenge, WARIS framework was initially designed to be modular in order to ease development cycles, portability, reusability and future extensions of the framework. In order to assess its performance, a code that solves the vectorial Advection-Diffusion-Sedimentation equation has been ported to the WARIS framework. This problem appears in many geophysical applications, including atmospheric transport of passive substances. As an application example, we focus on atmospheric dispersion of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash,</b> <b>a</b> case in which operational code performance is critical given the threat posed by this substance on aircraft engines. Preliminary results are very promising, performance has been improved by 8. 2 × with respect to the baseline code using a realistic case.

Kaye, Edwin Hirst, Andreas Wieser, Warren Stanley, ???Dust layer {{profiling}} {{using an}} aerosol dropsonde???, poster {{presented at the}} European Geosciences Union General Assembly, Vienna, Austria, 12 - 17 April, 2015. Routine meteorological data is obtained in the atmosphere using disposable radiosondes, giving temperature, pressure, humidity and wind speed. Additional measurements are obtained from dropsondes, released from research aircraft. However, a crucial property not yet measured is the size and concentration of atmospheric particulates, including dust. Instead, indirect measurements are employed, relying on remote sensing, {{to meet the demands}} from areas such as climate research, air quality monitoring, civil emergencies etc. In addition, research aircraft can be used in situ, but airborne measurements are expensive, and aircraft use is restricted to near-horizontal profiling, which can be a limitation, as phenomena such as long-range transport depend on the vertical distribution of aerosol. The Centre for Atmospheric and Instrumentation Research at University of Hertfordshire develops light-scattering instruments for the characterization of aerosols and cloud particles. Recently a range of low-cost, miniature particle counters has been created, intended for use with systems such as disposable balloon-borne radiosondes, dropsondes, or in dense ground-based sensor networks. Versions for different particle size ranges exist. They have been used for vertical profiling of aerosols such as mineral dust or <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash.</b> <b>A</b> disadvantage of optical particle counters that sample through a narrow inlet is that they can become blocked, which can happen in cloud, for example. Hence, a different counter version has been developed, which can have open-path geometry, as the sensing zone is defined optically rather than being delimited by the flow system. This counter has been used for ground based air-quality monitoring around Heathrow airport. The counter has also been adapted for use with radiosondes or dropsondes. The dropsonde version has been successfully tested by launching it from research aircraft together with the so-called KITsonde, developed at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, which determines standard meteorological variables and GPS position for transmission back to the aircraft. During some of the tests a Saharan dust layer transported over Europe was intercepted and characterized...|$|E
