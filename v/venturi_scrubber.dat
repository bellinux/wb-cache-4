500|$|The {{iron making}} blast furnace itself is {{built in the}} form of a tall structure, lined with {{refractory}} brick, and profiled to allow for expansion of the charged materials as they heat during their descent, and subsequent reduction in size as melting starts to occur. Coke, limestone flux, and iron ore (iron oxide) are charged into the top of the furnace in a precise filling order which helps control gas flow and the chemical reactions inside the furnace. Four [...] "uptakes" [...] allow the hot, dirty gas high in carbon monoxide content to exit the furnace throat, while [...] "bleeder valves" [...] protect the top of the furnace from sudden gas pressure surges. The coarse particles in the exhaust gas settle in the [...] "dust catcher" [...] and are dumped into a railroad car or truck for disposal, while the gas itself flows through a <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubber</b> and/or electrostatic precipitators and a gas cooler to reduce the temperature of the cleaned gas.|$|E

50|$|Like a {{spray tower}} an ejector <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubber</b> uses a {{preformed}} spray. However, in an ejector <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubber</b> {{only a single}} nozzle is used instead of many nozzles. This nozzle operates at higher pressures and higher injection rates than those in most spray chambers. The high-pressure spray nozzle (up to 689 kPa or 100 psig) is aimed at the throat section of a venturi constriction.|$|E
50|$|Venturis {{are also}} used to control fly ash and sulfur dioxide {{emissions}} from industrial and utility boilers.The operating characteristics of <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubbers</b> are listed in Table 1.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{capable of}} some {{incidental}} control of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOC), generally <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubbers</b> are limited to control PM (particulate matter) and high solubility gases (EPA, 1992; EPA, 1996).|$|R
50|$|All <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubbers</b> {{require an}} {{entrainment}} separator because the high velocity of gas through the scrubber {{will have a}} tendency to entrain the droplets with the outlet clean gas stream.|$|R
5000|$|Next, the gas {{enters a}} <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubber</b> where {{approximately}} half of the gases are removed. Venturi scrubbers have a minimum particle removal efficiency of 95%.|$|E
5000|$|A {{recirculation}} pump moves {{some of the}} spent scrubbing liquid back to the <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubber</b> where it is recycled and the remainder is sent to a treatment system.|$|E
50|$|Venturi {{scrubbers}} achieve {{very high}} collection efficiencies for respirable dust. Since efficiency of a <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubber</b> depends on pressure drop, some manufacturers supply a variable-throat venturi to maintain pressure drop with varying gas flows.|$|E
5000|$|For {{simultaneous}} {{removal of}} [...] and fly ash, <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubbers</b> can be used. In fact, {{many of the}} industrial sodium-based throwaway systems are <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubbers</b> originally designed to remove particulate matter. These units were slightly modified to inject a sodium-based scrubbing liquor. Although removal of both particles and [...] in one vessel can be economic, the problems of high pressure drops and finding a scrubbing medium to remove heavy loadings of fly ash must be considered. However, {{in cases where the}} particle concentration is low, such as from oil-fired units, it can be more effective to remove particulate and [...] simultaneously.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{maintenance}} {{problem for}} <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubbers</b> is wear, or abrasion, of the scrubber shell {{because of high}} gas velocities. Gas velocities in the throat can reach speeds of 430 km/h (270 mph). Particles and liquid droplets traveling at these speeds can rapidly erode the scrubber shell.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Venturi</b> <b>scrubbers</b> {{have been}} {{designed}} to collect particles at very high collection efficiencies, sometimes exceeding 99%. The ability of venturis to handle large inlet volumes at high temperatures makes them very attractive to many industries; consequently, they are used to reduce particulate emissions in a number of industrial applications.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubber</b> is {{designed}} to effectively use the energy from the inlet gas stream to atomize the liquid being used to scrub the gas stream. This type of technology {{is a part of}} the group of air pollution controls collectively referred to as wet scrubbers.|$|E

50|$|An ejector or <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubber</b> is an {{industrial}} pollution control device, usually {{installed on the}} exhaust flue gas stacks of large furnaces, but may also be used on {{any number of other}} air exhaust systems.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to parametrical {{analysis}} of model, and is aimed at understanding its possibilities {{to find the most}} profitable conditions for the technical processes. These processes should consider the maximal extraction of gas and mechanical admixtures from the flow on the droplets of irrigating liquid and reduce the dimensions of hollow direct-flow jet <b>scrubbers</b> (DFJS) and <b>Venturi</b> <b>scrubbers</b> (VS) ...|$|R
5000|$|Cyclonic spray {{scrubbers}} {{are more}} efficient than spray towers, but not as efficient as <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubbers,</b> in removing particulate from the inlet gas stream. Particulates larger than 5 Âµm are generally collected by impaction with 90% efficiency. In a simple spray tower, the velocity of the particulates in the gas stream is low: 0.6 to 1.5 m/s (2 to 5 ft/s).|$|R
50|$|Cyclonic, mesh-pad, and blade {{separators}} are {{all used}} to remove liquid droplets from the flue gas {{and return the}} liquid to the scrubber water. Cyclonic separators, the most popular for use with <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubbers,</b> {{are connected to the}} venturi vessel by a flooded elbow (Figure 8). The liquid reduces abrasion of the elbow as the outlet gas flows at high velocities from the venturi into the separator.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubber</b> {{consists}} of three sections: a converging section, a throat section, and a diverging section. The inlet gas stream enters the converging section and, as the area decreases, gas velocity increases (in accordance with the Bernoulli equation). Liquid is introduced either at the throat or {{at the entrance to}} the converging section.|$|E
5000|$|The high inlet gas {{velocities}} in a <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubber</b> {{result in}} a very short contact time between the liquid and gas phases. This short contact time limits gas absorption. However, because venturis have a relatively open design compared to other scrubbers, they are very useful for simultaneous gaseous and particulate pollutant removal, especially when: ...|$|E
50|$|A wet scrubber, or <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubber,</b> {{is similar}} to a cyclone but it has an orifice unit that sprays water into the vortex in the cyclone section, {{collecting}} all of the dust in a slurry system. The water media can be recirculated and reused to continue to filter the air. Eventually the solids must be removed from the water stream and disposed of.|$|E
40|$|Small {{particles}} can {{be removed}} from gases by only four means, inertial, diffusional, electrostatic and agglomerative means; some practical aspects of the theory describing these four ways of separation are presented. This is done by considering the design correlations currently used for predicting the collection efficiency of cyclones, <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubbers,</b> impingement devices and electrostatic precipatators. Some relative cost data is appended together with a selected bibliography on some gas scrubbers...|$|R
50|$|In {{place of}} or in {{combination}} with air quality standards and emission control standards, governments may choose to reduce air pollution by requiring regulated parties to adopt emissions control technologies (i.e., technology that reduces or eliminates emissions). Such devices include {{but are not limited}} to flare stacks, incinerators, catalytic combustion reactors, selective catalytic reduction reactors, electrostatic precipitators, baghouses, wet scrubbers, cyclones, thermal oxidizers, <b>Venturi</b> <b>scrubbers,</b> carbon adsorbers, and biofilters.|$|R
5000|$|Spray towers are {{low energy}} scrubbers. Contacting power {{is much lower}} than in <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubbers,</b> and the {{pressure}} drops across such systems are generally less than 2.5 cm (1 in) of water. The collection efficiency for small particles is correspondingly lower than in more energy-intensive devices. They are adequate for the collection of coarse particles larger than 10-25 Âµm in diameter, although with increased liquid inlet nozzle pressures, particles with diameters of 2.0 Âµm can be collected.|$|R
50|$|Results {{of these}} {{findings}} {{led to the development}} of the annular-orifice, or adjustable-throat, <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubber</b> (Figure 5). The size of the throat area is varied by moving a plunger, or adjustable disk, up or down in the throat, thereby decreasing or increasing the annular opening. Gas flows through the annular opening and atomizes liquid that is sprayed onto the plunger or swirled in from the top.|$|E
5000|$|The bioethanol-processor also {{produces}} {{a stream of}} highly concentrated {{carbon dioxide and other}} trace gases that are not burned completely during combustion. This gas flow is mixed with sea water in one or more ejector <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubber</b> and then through a new system called SECO2 (or CO2 Removal System), developed by Bionet, and whose purpose is to dissolve the [...] "bubbles" [...] of CO2 in water to undetectable levels.|$|E
5000|$|By {{introducing}} the inlet gas tangentially into the spray chamber, the cyclonic scrubber increases gas velocities (thus, particulate velocities) to approximately 60 to 180 m/s (200 to 600 ft/s). The {{velocity of the}} liquid spray is approximately the same in both devices. This higher particulate-to-liquid relative velocity increases particulate collection efficiency for this device over that of the spray chamber. Gas velocities of 60 to 180 m/s are equivalent to those encountered in a <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubber.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A packed {{scrubber}} {{consists of a}} tower with packing material inside. This packing material {{can be in the}} shape of saddles, rings, or some highly specialized shapes designed to maximize contact area between the dirty gas and liquid. Packed towers typically operate at much lower pressure drops than <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubbers</b> and are therefore cheaper to operate. They also typically offer higher [...] removal efficiency. The drawback is that they have a greater tendency to plug up if particles are present in excess in the exhaust air stream.|$|R
50|$|A wet scrubber's {{ability to}} collect small {{particles}} is often {{directly proportional to}} the power input into the scrubber. Low energy devices such as spray towers are used to collect particles larger than 5 micrometers. To obtain high efficiency removal of 1 micrometer (or less) particles generally requires high-energy devices such as <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubbers</b> or augmented devices such as condensation scrubbers. Additionally, a properly designed and operated entrainment separator or mist eliminator is important to achieve high removal efficiencies. The greater the number of liquid droplets that are not captured by the mist eliminator, the higher the potential emission levels.|$|R
5000|$|Theoretically, {{the smaller}} the {{droplets}} formed, the higher the collection efficiency achieved for both gaseous and particulate pollutants. However, the liquid droplets must {{be large enough to}} not be carried out of the scrubber by the scrubbed outlet gas stream. Therefore, spray towers use nozzles that produce droplets that are usually 500-1000 Âµm in diameter. Although small in size, these droplets are large compared to those created in <b>venturi</b> <b>scrubbers</b> that are 10-50 Âµm in size. The gas velocity is kept low, from 0.3 to 1.2 m/s (1-4 ft/s), to prevent excess droplets from being carried out of the tower.|$|R
