She discussed the Lakefield sketches as backgrounds for the tale with Warne. He proposed a large format volume similar to L.

5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, Douglas Stenton, {{director}} for heritage in the Nunavut territory in north eastern Canada, suggested that {{four sets of}} European human remains found could possibly be women. He initially suspected that DNA testing would not offer up anything more, but to his surprise they registered {{that there was no}} 'Y' chromosomal element to the DNA. Stenton acknowledged that women were known to have served in the Royal Navy in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries, but he also pointed out that {{it could be that the}} DNA had simply degraded as further tests proved ambiguous. Stenton also stated that whilst the probability of four disguised women aboard the two ships was <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> low; he could not rule it out completely.|$|E

And Mr. Mc Gregor becomes very angry too, and he throws a rotten vegetable marrow out through the window, hitting {{the youngest of the}} eavesdropping bunnies who has been sitting on the window-sill (leaving the Mc Gregors to argue). Their parents decide it is time to go home. At Christmas, they send the heroic little wood mouse a quantity of rabbit-wool. She makes herself a cloak and a hood, and a muff and mittens.|$|E

Their highly {{anticipated}} third battle drew a capacity crowd of over 11,000. Barrera started fast and rocked Morales late in the first round and bloodied his nose in the second. Morales came back strongly in the second half of the fight and won four of the last six rounds on two judges' scorecards. However, the judges scored the bout 114–114, 114–115, 113–115 in favor of Barrera, in what was justifiably a <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> close, but non-controversial and justifiable win for Barrera.

25|$|A metamaterial-based device {{wirelessly}} converts a 900MHz microwave {{signal to}} 7.3 volts of direct current (greater {{than that of}} a USB device). The device can be tuned to harvest other signals including Wi-Fi signals, satellite signals, or even sound signals. The experimental device used a series of five fiberglass and copper conductors. Conversion efficiency reached 37 percent. When traditional antennas are close to each other in space they interfere with each other. But since RF power goes down by the cube of the distance, the amount of power is <b>very</b> <b>very</b> small. While the claim of 7.3 volts is grand, the measurement is for an open circuit. Since the power is so low, there can be almost no current when any load is attached.|$|E

Coleman, who would finish the 1952 season with 103 goals, did not score a goal in the match; {{and this was the}} first (and the only) time that Coleman was held goal-less in his entire 98 game career. He had less than half a dozen kicks for the entire match — despite being moved to centre-half forward for a while during the second quarter — and was only able to score two behinds, one of which was effected with the last scoring kick of the match.|$|E
