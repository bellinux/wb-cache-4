5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it felt like we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>on</b> wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E

25|$|This work is chiefly {{remarkable}} {{because in}} some places it seems to recommend parents not to bequeath anything to their children, on the plea {{that it is better}} for the children to suffer want in this world than that their parents should be damned in the next (iii. 4).

50|$|Civil Celebrancy for {{independent}} community based officiants with ideals of meaningful ceremonies started in Australia {{due to the}} initiative of the Australian statesman and Attorney-General Lionel Murphy in 1973.

50|$|Finnish voters' growing {{frustration}} with Parliament's performance was {{reflected by the}} low voter turnout; the Social Democrats and Agrarians, championing the cause of poor workers and farmers, kept gaining votes {{at the expense of}} the Old Finns, whose main concern was the passive defence of Finland´s self-government. They disagreed on the social and economic policies, and thus did not formulate <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> positions <b>on</b> them.|$|R
25|$|On 18 May 2016, Governor Claudia Pavlovich Arellano {{ordered all}} civil {{registries}} {{in the state}} to stop marrying same-sex couples. She said that the Civil Code of Sonora is <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>on</b> what marriage is and that the state would continue to follow those laws (even though the articles in the Civil Code that are denying marriage rights to same-sex couples have already been declared inoperable and unconstitutional). She added that civil registries may still marry same-sex couples only if they are granted an injunction beforehand.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} {{declaring that the}} fight was off, Arum {{had a change of}} heart and offered Mayweather a 24-hour take-it-or-leave-it {{deadline}} to accept Team Pacquiao's terms for drug testing. Top Rank sent out a press release explaining their position on Mayweather's request for random Olympic-style drug testing. In it, Arum said Pacquiao was willing to submit to as many random urine tests requested, but as far as random blood tests were concerned, he was only willing to subject himself to 3 tests—one in January, one 30 days from the bout (no later than February 13) and one immediately after the fight: Let's be <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>on</b> the real issues we differ on. It's not about being tested....It's about who does the testing and the scheduling of the procedures....The major issue related to the testing rests with which independent agency will administer these tests. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) cannot do it because they will not amend its procedures to accommodate the blood testing schedule we have outlined. USADA, under its guidelines, would have the right to administer random blood tests as many times as they want up to weigh-in day and that is ludicrous.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Father Peter Fleetwood, {{a priest}} incardinated in the Archdiocese of Liverpool {{at the time}} serving as an {{official}} of the Pontifical Council for Culture, made comments supportive of the novels during a press conference announcing the release of Jesus Christ the Bearer of the Water of Life—A Christian reflection on the [...] "New Age." [...] In response to a question asking if the magic presented in the Harry Potter series should be considered in the same light as some New Age practices warned against in the document, Fleetwood stated, [...] "If I have understood well the intentions of Harry Potter's author, they help children to see the difference between good and evil. And she is <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>on</b> this." [...] He added that Rowling is [...] "Christian by conviction, is Christian in her mode of living, even in her way of writing." [...] This comment was seized on by the media as an endorsement of the novels from the Catholic Church, and by extension, the Pope at that time, John Paul II, though {{there is no evidence that}} the Pope officially approved of the novels.|$|E

50|$|In {{the set of}} {{buildings}} and gardens that we currently know, we must distinguish two <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> moments. <b>On</b> one side, the building made in 1882 by Mélida, raised on the second cloister of San Juan de los Reyes (destroyed by the French troops), {{and on the other}} hand, the building that, isolated from the previous one, rises in 1925 on the Convento de Santa Ana, whose chapel is preserved incorporated in the current building.|$|R
500|$|In January 2013, filming was {{scheduled}} to take place at Shepperton Studios in London, United Kingdom, and Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released in 3D. Victoria Alonso, an executive producer on the film, said that filming would begin in June. She also said that both Rocket Raccoon and Groot would be created {{through a combination of}} CGI and motion capture, going on to say that [...] "You can't do any motion capture with a raccoon – they won't let you put the suit on. But we will do rotomation, probably, for some of the behavior... we definitely will have performers to emulate what James Gunn will lead to be, the behavior and the performance. He's <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>on</b> where he wants to take the characters." [...] In March 2013, Feige discussed Guardians of the Galaxy in relation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, [...] "It's much more of a standalone film. It takes place in the same universe. And when we've been {{on the other side of}} that universe in other movies, you might see those characteristics in Guardians, but the Avengers are not involved with what's happening out there at this time." [...] Feige also stated that 95% of the film would take place in space. In mid-March, Dave Bautista was signed to play Drax the Destroyer. Other actors who had been considered for the role included Isaiah Mustafa, Brian Patrick Wade and Jason Momoa. By the following week, sculptor Brian Muir, who sculpted Darth Vader's mask for the Star Wars films, was revealed to be working on the film.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing [...] "The Long Game" [...] for The A.V. Club in 2013, Alasdair Wilkins {{gave it a}} {{grade of}} [...] "B-". He found it [...] "inessential" [...] and commented {{that it was not}} <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>on</b> the motives of the Editor and Jagrafess, but Pegg's {{performance}} was almost enough to make up for it. Overall he felt that the story [...] "presents a few too many simple ideas, with the cumulative effect that this is a story that feels slight at best, underdeveloped at worst. The episode is hardly a failure, {{but it could have been}} so much more." [...] In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk described the episode as [...] "entertaining, if unspectacular." [...] He called Pegg the best guest star so far, and stated that Langley did a [...] "superb job" [...] at conveying Adam, but he felt that the episode did not have much else beside the failed companion storyline. Burk criticised the satire for not being subtle enough and borrowing from other stories such as Nineteen Eighty-Four. He also remarked that it was a shame Adam's motives were cut, as well as development between Rose and Adam. Burk's coauthor Robert [...] was more positive, opining that a satire did not have to be subtle to be effective, and that viewers could still relate it to the news media today. He also praised the way [...] "The Long Game" [...] showed the Ninth Doctor as an [...] "inspirational figure." [...] The two also questioned the decision to leave Adam in the 21st century with future technology.|$|E
2500|$|During {{a debate}} {{televised}} by WCCO-TV on October 28, 2006, news reporter Pat Kessler quoted {{a story that}} appeared in the Minneapolis Star Tribune and asked Bachmann whether it was true that the church she belonged to taught that the Pope is the Anti-Christ. Bachmann stated that her church [...] "does not believe that the Pope is the Anti-Christ, that's absolutely false... I'm very grateful that my pastor has come out and been <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>on</b> this matter, and I think it's patently absurd and it's a false statement." ...|$|E

[...] "We think it's <b>very</b> <b>clear,</b> based <b>on</b> 36 years of what legal commentators said and based on every decision of this Court with the exception of McMahon, that Wilko said that the waiver of the choices in Section 22 amounted to an attempted waiver of the provision."

60|$|We {{went into}} the beer vaults, where a man drew beer into a long black jack, such as Scott describes. It is a tankard, made of black leather, I should think half a yard deep. He drew the beer from a large hogshead, and offered us some in a glass. It looked <b>very</b> <b>clear,</b> but, <b>on</b> tasting, I found it so {{exceedingly}} bitter that it struck me there would be small virtue for me in abstinence.|$|R

2500|$|The common {{intention}} of these {{several types of}} experiments is to first do something that, some interpretations of theory say, would make each photon [...] "decide" [...] whether {{it was going to}} behave as a particle or behave as a wave, and then, before the photon had time to reach the detection device, create another change in the system that would make it seem that the photon had [...] "chosen" [...] to behave in the opposite way. Some interpreters of these experiments contend that a photon either is a wave or is a particle, and that it cannot be both at the same time. Wheeler's intent was to investigate the time-related conditions under which a photon makes this transition between alleged states of being. His work has been productive of many revealing experiments. He may not have anticipated the possibility that other researchers would tend toward the conclusion that a photon retains both its [...] "wave nature" [...] and [...] "particle nature" [...] until the time it ends its life, e.g., by being absorbed by an electron which acquires its energy and therefore rises to a higher-energy orbital in its atom. However, he himself seems to be <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>on</b> this point. He says: ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{opposition}} to the bill, the government referred it back to the House Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights for possible amendment before introducing it for Second Reading. The bill was quietly shelved during the summer of 2012. Citing public opposition, the government announced in February 2013 that the legislation had been withdrawn. Nicholson stated that the government had [...] "listened to the concerns of Canadians who have been <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>on</b> this and responding to that". He added, “We will not be proceeding with Bill C-30. And any attempts to modernize the criminal code will not contain …warrantless mandatory disclosure of basic subscriber information or the requirement for telecommunications service providers to build intercept capability within their systems.” Bill C-55, which was originally part of the original Internet surveillance legislation, is all that remains of the contentious Bill C-30. Bill C-55 is needed to bring Canada’s emergency wiretapping powers into conformity with a 2012 Supreme Court decision that struck down a 20-year-old law {{on the grounds that it}} did not require police to inform those who had been wiretapped after the fact or provide for any other oversight of the police power. Thus on account of this bill, any persons subject to government surveillance or wiretapping in Canada must legally be informed of the surveillance after the fact.|$|E
