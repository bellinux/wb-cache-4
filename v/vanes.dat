The empennage consisted of vertical and horizontal <b>vanes</b> arranged like the fletching of an arrow, behind which the vertical rudder was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the vertical <b>vanes</b> of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paperdescribes the {{theoretical}} analysis on themechanical efficiencyof ahydraulic-balanced <b>vane</b> pump and presents a design concept to decide {{values such as}} <b>vane</b> thickness and cam lift to improve its mechanical efficiency. In this paper, the friction torque characteristics of the balanced <b>vane</b> pump, especially the friction torque caused by the friction between a camcon-tour and <b>vane</b> tips are both experimentally and theoretically investigated. Although the friction force increaseswith <b>vane</b> thickness increasedue to increase in the <b>vane</b> force, themechanical effi-ciency of the <b>vane</b> pumpdoes not decreasewhen the cam lift becomes large as the <b>vane</b> thickness is increased. An important parameter 1 defined as the ratio to be obtained by dividing the cam lift by the <b>vane</b> thickness determines essentially the mechanical efficiency of the <b>vane</b> pump. The pumps with the same 1 have the same mechanical efficiencies, even if the cam lift or the <b>vane</b> thickness varies. A larger value of 1 leads the <b>vane</b> pump to obtain a higher mechanical efficiency although the limit of <b>vane</b> strength governs the upper limit for 1. Additionally, reducing the friction coefficient of the <b>vane</b> tip contributes to improvement of the mechanical efficiency...|$|R

5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air <b>vanes</b> for control.|$|E

40|$|In the {{compression}} mechanisms of a rotary compressor for air conditioners, a <b>vane</b> and a rolling piston are provided {{to separate the}} suction chamber and {{the compression}} chamber. The rolling piston {{is driven by the}} crank, and revolves on the axis of the shaft eccentrically, and also rotates on its own axis. The <b>vane</b> undergoes reciprocating motion, and its top usually comes into contact with the rolling piston by the spring force and the discharge pressure. The lubricating condition between the <b>vane</b> top and the rolling piston is severe because the contact pressure is high owing to the line contact of the <b>vane</b> top. For the prevention of scuffing, abnormal wear and so on, it is important to clarify the lubricating characteristics between the <b>vane</b> top and the rolling piston. Because the normal force acting on piston at <b>vane</b> contact is greatly influenced by the friction of <b>vane</b> sliding surface between the <b>vane</b> and the vane-slot, a mixed lubrication analysis of the <b>vane</b> sliding surface between the <b>vane</b> and the vane-slot is required to obtain the normal force acting on piston at <b>vane</b> contact accurately. In order to investigate the lubricating characteristics between the <b>vane</b> top and the rolling piston, a numerical analysis of the motion of the rolling piston and the motion of the <b>vane</b> considering the mixed lubrication of the <b>vane</b> sliding surface has been performed. The cases of different friction coefficient of the <b>vane</b> sliding surface at solid contact were calculated, and the results were compared. As a result, the effects of the friction of the <b>vane</b> sliding surface on the lubricating characteristics between the <b>vane</b> top and the rolling piston have been made clear...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} a free power turbine designed for a 112 -kW, automotive, gas turbine engine was made to determine the penalty in performance due to the stator <b>vane</b> end clearances. Tests were made over a range of mean section stator <b>vane</b> angles from 26 deg to 50 deg (as measured from the plane of rotation) with the <b>vane</b> end clearances filled. These results were compared with test results of the same turbine with <b>vane</b> end clearances open. At design equivalent values of rotative speed and pressure ratio and at a <b>vane</b> angle of 35 deg, the mass flow with the <b>vane</b> and clearances filled was about 8 percent lower than mass flow with <b>vane</b> end clearances open. The decrease in mass flow was mitigated by increasing the <b>vane</b> angle. With the <b>vane</b> end clearances filled, there was about a 66 percent reduction in mass flow when the <b>vane</b> angle was decreased from 40 deg to 26 deg. For the same decrease in <b>vane</b> angle the stator throat area decreased by about 50 percent. This result indicates that the rotor losses were increasing with decreasing <b>vane</b> angle...|$|R

5|$|Unlike the B-1A, the B-1B cannot reach Mach2+ speeds; {{its maximum}} speed is Mach1.25 (about 950mph or 1,530km/h at altitude), but its {{low-level}} speed increased to Mach0.92 (700mph, 1,130km/h). The {{speed of the}} current version of the aircraft is limited by the need to avoid damage to its structure and air intakes. To help lower its radar cross section (RCS), the B-1B uses serpentine air intake ducts (see S-duct) and fixed intake ramps, which limit its speed compared to the B-1A. <b>Vanes</b> in the intake ducts serve to deflect and shield radar emissions from the highly reflective engine compressor blades.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{required}} Mach2 performance at high altitudes, the exhaust nozzles and air intake ramps were variable. Initially, it had been expected that a Mach1.2 performance could be achieved at low altitude, which required that titanium be used in critical areas in the fuselage and wing structure. The low altitude performance requirement was later lowered to Mach0.85, {{reducing the amount of}} titanium and therefore cost. A pair of small <b>vanes</b> mounted near the nose are part of an active vibration damping system that smooths out the otherwise bumpy low-altitude ride. The first three B-1As featured the escape capsule that ejected the cockpit with all four crew members inside. The fourth B-1A was equipped with a conventional ejection seat for each crew member.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of capillary flow {{can be a}} benefit or a hindrance in many applications. The existence of capillary flow in gaps in low-gravity environments is of special interest {{for the design of}} propellant management devices (PMD). The first generation of the <b>Vane</b> Gap Experiment gave experimental results in low-gravity for a rectangular <b>vane</b> in an elliptical cylinder. This study looks at the design of a third generation of <b>Vane</b> Gap Experiment by looking at the existence of capillary flow and the static liquid-interface solutions for a tapered <b>vane</b> placed in an elliptical cylinder. The <b>vane</b> in this study can be rotated to change the orientation of the <b>vane</b> to the cylinder wall and to change the size of the gap between the <b>vane</b> and the cylinder wall. Surface Evolver is used to obtain the results in this thesis. ^ Baseline cases (cases without rotation axis offset {{from the center of the}} ellipse) where the base width of the <b>vane</b> and its taper are varied, offset cases where the axis of orientation is not at the center of the cylinder but is at the center of the <b>vane,</b> and flipped cases which flip the <b>vane</b> studied in the offset cases from top to bottom so that the narrow end of the <b>vane</b> is immersed in the liquid are looked at. This thesis shows that as the <b>vane</b> orientation changes the height to which the liquid climbs the gap also changes. At certain <b>vane</b> rotation angles the gap size between the <b>vane</b> and the cylinder wall is small enough for the liquid to climb to the top of the <b>vane.</b> Depending on whether the wide end of the <b>vane</b> or the narrow end of the <b>vane</b> is immersed in the liquid, what the initial gap size is, and what the <b>vane</b> taper is, the liquid will climb to the top of the <b>vane</b> or will stop before it gets to the top. A bulk shift of the liquid from one side of the cylinder to the other is also observed in several cases. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{composition}} of most ash {{is such that}} its melting temperature is within the operating temperature (>1000 °C) of modern large jet engines. The degree of impact depends upon the concentration of ash in the plume, {{the length of time}} the aircraft spends within the plume and the actions taken by the pilots. Critically, melting of ash, particularly volcanic glass, can result in accumulation of resolidified ash on turbine nozzle guide <b>vanes,</b> resulting in compressor stall and complete loss of engine thrust. The standard procedure of the engine control system when it detects a possible stall is to increase power which would exacerbate the problem. It is recommended that pilots reduce engine power and quickly exit the cloud by performing a descending 180° turn. Volcanic gases, which are present within ash clouds, can also cause damage to engines and acrylic windshields, although this damage may not surface for many years.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{direction}} is usually {{expressed in terms}} of the direction from which it originates. For example, a northerly wind blows from the north to the south. Weather <b>vanes</b> pivot to indicate the direction of the wind. At airports, windsocks indicate wind direction, and {{can also be used to}} estimate wind speed by the angle of hang. Wind speed is measured by anemometers, most commonly using rotating cups or propellers. When a high measurement frequency is needed (such as in research applications), wind can be measured by the propagation speed of ultrasound signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance of a heated wire. Another type of anemometer uses pitot tubes that take advantage of the pressure differential between an inner tube and an outer tube that is exposed to the wind to determine the dynamic pressure, which is then used to compute the wind speed.|$|E
5|$|Between 1892 and 1895 the Agapemonites {{built the}} Church of the Good Shepherd in Upper Clapton, London. It was {{designed}} by Joseph Morris in a Gothic style.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine upgrades Honda introduced for the , McLaren brought a new aerodynamic package for the MP4-30 which revised the front wing to increase downforce, altered the turning <b>vanes</b> to improve air flow over the front splitter, and adopted a concept pioneered by Ferrari to the rear floor designed to reduce the impact of airflow washing over the rear wheels and disrupting the rear diffuser, which in turn opened up {{a wider range of}} set-up options for the ride height and rake, or the angle between the front and rear ride height. These updates were designed to bring the MP4-30 in line with the designs developed by other teams. With the engine and aerodynamic updates, the team had hoped to compete for points on merit, and while Alonso clashed with Felipe Massa on the opening lap, he was running as high as fifth on the closing stages—and was on course to replicate the team's best result of the season—before suffering a loss of power and slipping back down the order to finish eleventh. With Alonso out of the points, Button was promoted to sixth. The race also saw what would be the car's best qualifying performance as Alonso started eleventh, while the six points Button scored saw the team close to within ten points of Sauber in the World Constructors' Championship. However, the result also meant that McLaren had endured its longest winless streak of fifty-three races, previously set between the 1977 Japanese Grand Prix and the 1981 British Grand Prix. Despite the progress that the team made over the previous rounds, the MP4-30's struggles continued in Mexico, with both drivers eliminated early in qualifying, and Jenson Button setting a new record for grid penalties, changing enough parts to warrant a seventy-place penalty. Alonso retired from the race with an incurable ERS problem that the team had identified the night before and Button finished fourteenth overall.|$|E
5|$|On July 30, 2011 it was {{announced}} that Cotto would make a second defence of his WBA title against rival Antonio Margarito (38-7, 27 KOs) in a rematch to their first fight, which took place in July 2008. The fight was set to take place at Madison Square Garden on December 3, 2011. The MGM Grand was also considered as a possible venue. At first, the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) denied Margarito a boxing license on October 31, 2011. The reason for the denial was not due the cheating allegations, but instead due to the damage to Margarito's eye in the Manny Pacquiao fight. An appeal was filed and a hearing took place to where several leading eye doctors testified that Margarito should be allowed to fight. A final decision was expected on November 18, 2011. Without a license, Margarito could not fight in the state of New York. Arum initially stated that if Margarito was not licensed to fight, then <b>Vanes</b> Martirosyan would take his place on the card. However, Arum later stated that the fight would be moved to a venue in a state that Margarito holds a license. On November 18, 2011, the NYSAC did not make a final vote as expected. Instead, they ordered Margarito to be examined by their own doctor. Based on the findings of their own doctor, they would make a decision on whether Margarito received a license. The New York State Athletic Commission granted Antonio Margarito a license to box in New York after a hearing in Manhattan. A sold-out crowd of 21,239 {{was announced}}. Cotto avenged the defeat from 2008 stopping Margarito in the 10th round. The fight was stopped {{at the start of the}} 10th round because of the condition of Margarito's right eye, which was swollen shut. This was the same eye that was badly damaged in his fight with Pacquiao and the one that almost kept the New York State Athletic Commission from granting him his boxing license because of the special procedure that was performed on it in 2010. At the time of stoppage, Cotto lead 89-82 on all three judges scorecards. For the fight, Cottor earned a minimum $5 million, the figure would increase due to PPV shares and Margarito earned $2.5 million.|$|E
