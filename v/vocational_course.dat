40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify the change of the <b>vocational</b> <b>courses</b> in high school education. In the 1950 's and the 1960 's some prefectures in rural areas multiplied <b>vocational</b> <b>courses</b> in order to develop the community. However. after 1972. the ratio of <b>vocational</b> <b>courses</b> decreased. On the other hand. {{academic}} courses increased because many students wanted to go on to academic courses. Metropolitan areas, where the influence of the second baby boom was markedly. set up many academic courses. Nowadays many prefectures reduce the distinction between the <b>vocational</b> <b>courses</b> and the academic courses. As a result, the function of the selection in high school education weakens. This function must be important...|$|R
