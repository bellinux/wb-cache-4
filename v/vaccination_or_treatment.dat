40|$|Aim of Study: The aim of {{this review}} was to {{determine}} the precautions to be taken by dental surgeons and auxiliaries. Methodology: Literature review was conducted from 1966 to 2015 about Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Information on the transmission, laboratory findings, treatment options and precautionary measures were analysed. Results: No evidence suggested that animal livestock were a direct or intermediate source of MERS-CoV. Contrasting reports showed infection in a hospital with history of contact with camels. During community outbreaks, spread of the virus among close family members have been reported. Of greater concern was the outbreak in 2013 where a number of healthcare professionals were infected.

MCP- 1, expressed 110 times more strongly than IL- 2, identified 87. 5 % of asymptomatic subjects and verified some asymptomatic subjects close to the cutoff. MCP- 1 was also significantly elevated in all patients cured of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), unlike IL- 2, indicating the specific memory response generated against Leishmania.

40|$|Objective:: To {{assess the}} {{economic}} implications of strategies for influenza control among healthy working adults in The Netherlands. Methods:: The economic evaluation {{was based on}} a pharmaco-economic model from the societal perspective. This model involves the direct and indirect costs of <b>vaccination</b> <b>or</b> <b>treatment</b> and the direct and indirect savings (averted costs) due to the control strategy. Control strategies comprised treatment with oseltamivir and prevention with the influenza vaccine. Clinical and economic parameter estimates were derived from published literature, databases and expert opinions. Several scenarios for age-groups and employment contracts (full-time versus not) were elaborated in combination with Monte Carlo simulation for probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results:: Consistently, net cost savings are estimated over the range of age groups and scenarios considered. Net savings are smallest for half-time workers. Incremental analysis indicates that on average prevention renders higher cost savings than treatment. Conclusion:: We found a consistent picture of net cost savings for prevention through vaccination and treatment with oseltamivir of influenza in healthy working adults in The Netherlands.

40|$|Infectious {{disease is}} an {{emerging}} threat that conservationists are ill-equipped to manage. The threat is greatest for small populations, {{which can be}} driven to extinction by virulent pathogens; these are usually generalist pathogens that 'spill over' from other host species, often domestic animals. Recent attempts at disease control have taken a variety of forms, some directed at threatened hosts themselves, and others involving reservoir hosts. Thus far, few such attempts have demonstrated clear benefits of intervention, often because they were 'crisis management' tactics allowing no comparison with untreated controls. Design of future strategies is hampered {{by a lack of}} basic information concerning the pathogens that represent serious threats, their epidemiology in multiple-host systems, and the <b>vaccination</b> <b>or</b> <b>treatment</b> protocols likely to be most effective under field conditions. In general, vaccination and treatment will be most valuable in tiny populations facing very high extinction risks. However, interventions that are poorly planned or under-funded have the potential to do more harm than good. In larger populations, or over larger areas, intensive management may be inappropriate, unsustainable, or simply impractical. In these circumstances, managing population size, structure or contact between host species could offer promising alternatives to intervention...|$|E
40|$|Tuberculosis is {{an ancient}} disease that {{continues}} to threaten individual and public health today, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Current surveillance systems describe general risk of tuberculosis in a population but do not characterize the risk to an individual following exposure to an infectious case. In a study of household contacts of infectious tuberculosis cases (n =  1918) and a community survey of tuberculosis infection (N =  1179) in Kampala, Uganda, we estimated the secondary attack rate for tuberculosis disease and tuberculosis infection. The ratio of these rates is the likelihood of progressive primary disease after recent household infection. The secondary attack rate for tuberculosis disease was 3. 0 % (95 % confidence interval: 2. 2, 3. 8). The overall secondary attack rate for tuberculosis infection was 47. 4 (95 % confidence interval: 44. 3, 50. 6) and did not vary widely with age, HIV status or BCG vaccination. The risk for progressive primary disease was highest among the young or HIV infected and was reduced by BCG vaccination.

40|$|Two {{new models}} for {{controlling}} diseases, incorporating the best features of different control measures, are proposed and analyzed. These models would draw from poultry, livestock and government expertise to quickly, cooperatively and cost-effectively stop disease outbreaks. The combination strategy of pulse <b>vaccination</b> and <b>treatment</b> (<b>or</b> isolation) is implemented in both models {{if the number}} of infectives reaches the risk level (RL). Firstly, for one time impulsive effect we compare three different control strategies for both models in terms of cost. The theoretical and numerical results show that there is an optimal vaccination and treatment proportion such that integrated pulse <b>vaccination</b> and <b>treatment</b> (<b>or</b> isolation) reaches its minimum in terms of cost. Moreover, this minimum cost of integrated strategy is less than any cost of single pulse <b>vaccination</b> <b>or</b> single <b>treatment.</b> Secondly, a more realistic case for the second model is investigated based on periodic impulsive control strategies. The existence and stability of periodic solution with the maximum value of the infectives no larger than RL is obtained. Further, the period T of the periodic solution is calculated, which can be used to estimate how long the infectious population will take to return back to its pre-control level (RL) once integrated control tactics cease. This implies that we can control the disease if we implement the integrated disease control tactics every period T. For periodic control strategy, if we aim to control the disease such that the maximum number of infectives is relatively small, our results show that the periodic pulse vaccination is optimal in terms of cost.

40|$|AbstractChronic {{conditions}} {{contribute to}} the majority of the mortality and morbidity burden in Europe. The extent to which infectious agents are responsible for the chronic disease burden remains elusive. The complex nature of the natural history of chronic conditions calls for an overview of ongoing research activities linking infectious agents with these conditions in order to guide research endeavours, direct research funding, steer prevention efforts, and point health policy towards promising interventions. A selection of websites hosted by institutions either financing or conducting research within the European Union was screened for ongoing research activities examining infectious aetiology of chronic conditions. The searches were conducted until September 2011, applying search strategies and inclusion criteria predefined in a study protocol. In total, 25 research activities met the inclusion criteria. Of those, ten activities were focused to investigate infectious aetiology of cancer, four focused on type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 11 focused on a wide spectrum of other chronic conditions. The identified research projects did not cover areas such as mental and behavioural disorders. Infectious agents analysed included enteroviruses, Epstein-Barr virus, human rhinoviruses, P. gingivalis, human papillomaviruses, cytomegalovirus, Helicobacter spp. and human parvovirus. Only three projects specifically addressed therapeutic interventions. Ultimately, linking infectious agents with chronic conditions may translate into prevention efforts with <b>vaccinations</b> <b>or</b> <b>treatment</b> strategies with antimicrobial agents, and could, thus, eventually reduce the heavy disease burden from chronic conditions. However, little translational research on therapeutic interventions was found in our search and should be fostered, particularly for more established infectious-chronic disease associations...|$|R

In order to facilitate mRNA transfections for future therapeutic applications, {{there is a need}} for the delivery system to achieve optimal transfection efficacy, perform with durable stability, and provide drug safety. The objective of our study was to comprehensively analyze the use of 3 β-[N-(N',N'-dimethylaminoethane) carbamoyl](DC-Cholesterol) /dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) liposomes as a potential transfection agent for modified mRNAs. Our cationic liposomes facilitated a high degree of mRNA encapsulation and successful cell transfection efficiencies. More importantly, no negative effects on cell viability or immune reactions were detected posttransfection. Notably, the liposomes had a long-acting transfection effect on cells, resulting in a prolonged protein production of alpha- 1 -antitrypsin (AAT). In addition, the stability of these mRNA-loaded liposomes allowed storage for 80  days, without the loss of transfection efficacy. Finally, comprehensive analysis showed that these liposomes are fully hemocompatible with fresh human whole blood. In summary, we present an extensive analysis on the use of DC-cholesterol/DOPE liposomes as mRNA delivery vehicles. This approach provides the basis of a safe and efficient therapeutic strategy in the development of successful mRNA-based drugs...|$|E

Hence, we first consider the setting where there are two controls u_ 1 and u_ 3. We also consider the scenario where there is no vector elimination, or control u_ 3 since it might be dangerous to use pesticides in some area such as hospitals or living habitats for a long time. This can be represented by the setting with only two controls, u_ 1 and u_ 2. Lastly, we consider the scenario where three controls are applied together. Therefore, the three scenarios are as follows: i) with controls u_ 1 and u_ 2, ii) with controls u_ 1 and u_ 3, and iii) with three controls u_ 1, u_ 2, and u_ 3. In practice, our strategy cannot be completely implemented, so the maximum value of each control is set to be 0.9 instead of  1. Consequently, we simulated three different scenarios to the optimality system with controls and the optimality system without control. The numerical results for each class of individuals and vectors are illustrated. In every graph, each of the individuals without control is represented by a solid line. The individuals with controls are represented as follows: a red dash-dot line for the system with controls u_ 1 and u_ 2, a blue dash-dot line for the system with controls u_ 1 and u_ 3, and a black dashed line for the system with all three controls.|$|E

40|$|Disease in {{wildlife}} {{raises a}} number of issues that have not been widely considered in the bioethical literature. However, wildlife disease has major implications for human welfare. The majority of emerging human infectious diseases are zoonotic: that is, they occur in humans by cross-species transmission from animal hosts. Managing these diseases often involves balancing concerns with human health against animal welfare and conservation concerns. Many infectious diseases of domestic animals are shared with wild animals, although it is often unclear whether the infection spills over from wild animals to domestic animals or vice versa. Culling is the standard means of managing such diseases, bringing economic considerations, animal welfare and conservation into conflict. Infectious diseases are also major threatening processes in conservation biology and their appropriate management by culling, <b>vaccination</b> <b>or</b> <b>treatment</b> raises substantial animal ethics issues. One particular issue of great significance in Australia is an ongoing research program to develop genetically modified pathogens to control vertebrate pests including rabbits, foxes and house mice.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In Australia, {{higher rates}} of chronic {{hepatitis}} B (HBsAg) have been reported among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) compared with non-Indigenous people. In 2000, the Australian government implemented a universal infant/adolescent hepatitis B vaccination program. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the disparity of HBsAg prevalence between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, particularly since 2000. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase and public health bulletins up to March 2011. We used meta-analysis methods to estimate HBsAg prevalence by Indigenous status and time period (before and since 2000). RESULTS: There were 15 HBsAg prevalence estimates (from 12 studies) among Indigenous and non-Indigenous people; adults and pregnant women (n[*]=[*] 9), adolescents (n[*]=[*] 3), prisoners (n[*]=[*] 2), and infants (n[*]=[*] 1). Of these, only one subgroup (adults/pregnant women) involved studies before and since 2000 and {{formed the basis of}} the meta-analysis. Before 2000, the pooled HBsAg prevalence estimate was 6. 47 % (95 % CI: 4. 56 - 8. 39); 16. 72 % (95 %CI: 7. 38 - 26. 06) among Indigenous and 0. 36 % (95 %CI:- 0. 14 - 0. 86) in non-Indigenous adults/pregnant women. Since 2000, the pooled HBsAg prevalence was 2. 25 % (95 % CI: 1. 26 - 3. 23); 3. 96 % (95 %CI: 3. 15 - 4. 77) among Indigenous and 0. 90 % (95 % CI: 0. 53 - 1. 28) in non-Indigenous adults/pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: The disparity of HBsAg prevalence between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people has decreased over time; particularly since the HBV vaccination program in 2000. However HBsAg prevalence remains four times higher among Indigenous compared with non-Indigenous people. The findings highlight the need for opportunistic HBV screening of Indigenous people to identify people who would benefit from <b>vaccination</b> <b>or</b> <b>treatment.</b> Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E
40|$|Ebola virus (EBOV), {{a member}} of the family Filoviridae in the order Mononegavirales, is the causative agent of a severe {{haemorrhagic}} fever. Due to its high case fatality rate of up to 90 % and to the fact that no approved <b>vaccination</b> <b>or</b> <b>treatment</b> is available for EBOV infection, it is classified as a biosafety level 4 (BSL 4) agent, which restricts reasearch on it to a few facilities worldwide. Systems that model individual aspects of the viral life cycle under BSL 2 conditions are, therefore, highly desirable. Based on available reverse genetics systems we have developed several new systems that allow the analysis of viral genome transcription, replication and packaging, as well as nucleocapsid morphogenesis, particle formation, budding, entry and initial transcription in target cells under BSL 2 conditions. We were able to model two of these steps, morphogenesis of a fully functional nucleocapsid and initital transcription in target cells, for the first time for a negative strand RNA-virus, which is a significant advantage in reverse genetics systems for these viruses. The established systems were then used to analyze the role of EBOV proteins, particularly the matrix proteins VP 24 and VP 40, in the viral life cycle. The role of VP 24, the minor matrix protein of EBOV, has long been enigmatic. Recently, it has been shown to be involved in interferon antagonism; however, data regarding a possible involvement of VP 24 in nucleocapsid morphogenesis and particle formation have remained controversial. Using a newly developed infectious virus-like particle assay with na¨ıve target cells we were able to show that VP 24 is not necessary for budding of particles or genome packaging, but that it is indispensable for the formation of functional nucleocapsids. This is the first functional evidence for a role of VP 24 in nucleocapsid formation. Although the role of the major matrix protein, VP 40, is much better understood, virtually nothing is known about the function of the different oligomeric forms of VP 40, namely dimers, hexamers and octamers. Previously, we have been able to show that VP 40 octamerization is indispensable for the viral life cycle. As part of this work we have further analyzed the role of VP 40 octamerization. Also, based on the available crystal structures for VP 40 we designed and characterized a dimerization incompetent VP 40 mutant and included this mutant in our studies. We were able to show that VP 40 dimerization is a prerequisite for budding, while octamerization does not play a role in this process. Also, VP 40 octamerization is not important for packaging or the formation of a functional nucleocapsid. However, VP 40 octamers seem to influence transcription and/or replication of viral genomes, a phenomenon that has been previously described for the matrix protein of Rabies virus, another member of Mononegavirales. Also, our data suggest that VP 40 is involved in inhibition of cellular transcription and/or translation, a phenomenon widely known for matrix proteins of Mononegavirales, and that VP 40 dimerization is important for this function. Finally, we analyzed the interactions of the nucleocapsid protein NP with VP 40. We were, for the first time, able to directly show an interaction between these two proteins, and have mapped the interaction domain on VP 40 to two β-strands in the N-terminal domain. Based on the crystal structure of VP 40 we have identified two residues in this region that may be crucial for the interaction with NP. This work has increased our understanding of the role of EBOV matrix proteins in the viral life cycle, and has revealed several new functions for these proteins. The obtained results will allow us to specifically target individual aspects of the viral life cycle in order to develop new countermeasures against EBOV, but also to further investigate molecular details of these processes...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} of broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting the HIV- 1 envelope trimer to prevent HIV- 1 transmission has opened new avenues for therapies and vaccines. However, their implementation remains challenging and would profit from a deepened mechanistic understanding of HIV-antibody interactions and the mucosal transmission process. In {{this study we}} experimentally determined stoichiometric parameters of the HIV- 1 trimer-antibody interaction, confirming that binding of one antibody is sufficient for trimer neutralization. This defines numerical requirements for HIV- 1 virion neutralization and thereby enables mathematical modelling of in vitro and in vivo antibody neutralization efficacy. The model we developed accurately predicts antibody efficacy in animal passive immunization studies and provides estimates for protective mucosal antibody concentrations. Furthermore, we derive estimates of the probability for a single virion to start host infection and the risks of male-to-female HIV- 1 transmission per sexual intercourse. Our work thereby delivers comprehensive quantitative insights into both the molecular principles governing HIV-antibody interactions and the initial steps of mucosal HIV- 1 transmission.

40|$|Non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars, {{associated}} with different foods including poultry products, are important causes of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide.

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the genomes of 25 S. enterica serovars isolated from broiler chicken farms to assess their intra- and inter-genetic variability, with a focus on virulence and antibiotic resistance characteristics. The genomes of 25 S. enterica isolates covering five serovars (ten Typhimurium including three monophasic 4,[5], 12 :i:, four Enteritidis, three Hadar, four Heidelberg and four Kentucky) were sequenced. Most serovars were clustered in strongly supported phylogenetic clades, except for isolates of serovar Enteritidis that were scattered throughout the tree. Plasmids of varying sizes were detected in several isolates independently of serovars. Genes {{associated with}} the IncF plasmid and the IncI 1 plasmid were identified in twelve and four isolates, respectively, while genes associated with the IncQ plasmid were found in one isolate. The presence of numerous genes associated with Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs) was also confirmed. Components of the type III and IV secretion systems (T 3 SS and T 4 SS) varied in different isolates, which could explain in part, differences of their pathogenicity in humans and/or persistence in broilers. Conserved clusters of genes in the T 3 SS were detected that could be used in designing effective strategies (diagnostic, <b>vaccination</b> <b>or</b> <b>treatments)</b> to combat Salmonella. Antibiotic resistance genes (CMY, aadA, ampC, florR, sul 1, sulI, tetAB, and srtA) and class I integrons were detected in resistant isolates while all isolates carried multidrug efflux pump systems regardless of their antibiotic susceptibility profile. This study showed that the predominant Salmonella serovars in broiler chickens harbor genes encoding adhesins, flagellar proteins, T 3 SS, iron acquisition systems, and antibiotic and metal resistance genes that may explain their pathogenicity, colonization ability and persistence in chicken. The existence of mobile genetic elements indicates that isolates from a given serovar could acquire and transfer genetic material. Conserved genes in the T 3 SS and T 4 SS that we have identified are promising candidates for identification of diagnostic, antimicrobial or vaccine targets for the control of Salmonella in broiler chickens...|$|R
40|$|Preventing {{contagion}} in networks is {{an important}} problem in public health and other domains. Targeting nodes to immunize based on their network interactions {{has been shown to}} be far more effective at stemming infection spread than immunizing random subsets of nodes. However, the assumption that selected nodes can be rendered completely immune does not hold for infections for which there is no <b>vaccination</b> <b>or</b> effective <b>treatment.</b> Instead, one can confer fractional immunity to some nodes by allocating variable amounts of infection-prevention resource to them. We formulate the problem to distribute a fixed amount of resource across nodes in a network such that the infection rate is minimized, prove that it is NP-complete and derive a highly effective and efficient linear-time algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm compared to several other methods using simulation on realworld network datasets including US-MEDICARE and state-level interhospital patient transfer data. We find that concentrating resources at a small subset of nodes using our algorithm is up to 6 times more effective than distributing them uniformly (as is current practice) or using network-based heuristics. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formulate the problem, use truly nation-scale network data and propose effective algorithms. ...|$|R
40|$|Flavivirus infections by Zika and dengue virus {{impose a}} {{significant}} global healthcare threat with no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved <b>vaccination</b> <b>or</b> specific antiviral <b>treatment</b> available. Here, we present {{the discovery of}} an anti-flaviviral natural product named cavinafungin. Cavinafungin is a potent and selectively active compound against Zika and all four dengue virus serotypes. Unbiased, genome-wide genomic profiling in human cells using a novel CRISPR/Cas 9 protocol identified the endoplasmic-reticulum-localized signal peptidase as the efficacy target of cavinafungin. Orthogonal profiling in S.  cerevisiae followed by the selection of resistant mutants pinpointed the catalytic subunit of the signal peptidase SEC 11 as the evolutionary conserved target. Biochemical analysis confirmed a rapid block of signal sequence cleavage of both host and viral proteins by cavinafungin. This study provides an effective compound against the eukaryotic signal peptidase and independent confirmation of the recently identified critical role of the signal peptidase in the replicative cycle of flaviviruses...|$|R
40|$|Tick fever is {{a general}} name for a disease caused by both or either haemoparasites Babesia and Anaplasma. Cattle tick Boophilus microplus is the vector of the disease {{although}} anaplasmosis can also be transmitted by blood sucking insects. In most regions of Brazil, B. microplus can occur throughout the year because of suitable climate conditions. In the brazilian savannah region there are two or three cattle tick generations per year with a infestation peak in october. The increasing use of cultivated pastures and crosses with tick-susceptible european breeds has decreased resistance of zebu cattle in this region and control measures are suggested. Total control of B. microplus, howecer, can decrease cattle imunity and favours the occurence of tick fever. Laboratory texts such as blood smears, microhaematocrit, and sorology are required for a reliable diagnosis of the disease. Tick fever can be avoid by prophylactic measures (prmunition, <b>vaccination</b> <b>or</b> chemoprophylaxix). Therapeutic <b>treatment</b> {{is based on the}} use of drugs such as imidocarb (babesiosis) and tetracycline (anaplasmosis). 199...|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) immunopathogenesis has prompted multiple strategic approaches to re-establish normal immune responses. Highly active antiretro-viral therapy (HAART) can control viral replication, but it is unable to restore HIV-specific im-munity. Newer approaches for managing HIV infection are focusing on cell-mediated immune responses, including the potential for improved immunologic control over HIV replication. Cyto-kines, such as interleukin (IL) - 2 and IL- 12, are being evaluated {{for their ability to}} enhance cell-mediated immunity, which is thought to be critical for immunologic control. Initial studies with IL- 2 have demonstrated an improvement in CD 4 cell counts, and large randomized trials are un-derway to determine the long-term clinical efficacy of IL- 2 in combination with antiretroviral therapy, including HAART. Stimulating the immune response against HIV by use of exogenous (therapeutic <b>vaccination)</b> <b>or</b> endogenous (structured <b>treatment</b> interruption) antigens with or without immune adjuvants or cytokines, such as IL- 2, is another approach currently being explored...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{times of}} limited organs for transplantation, anti-HBc {{positive}} organs can be accepted for lung transplantation {{to increase the}} number of donors. Transplant recipients should be vaccinated against hepatitis B to prevent HBV infection. However, response after HBV vaccination has only been poorly evaluated in patients with end-stage pulmonary disease. Material/Methods: Anti-HBs titers of 40 anti-HBc negative patients with end-stage pulmonary disease evaluated for lung transplantation were analyzed with the Architect® system (Abbott, Germany). Responders, partial responders, or non-responders after HBV vaccination were defined by anti-HBs titers > 100 IU/L, 10 – 100 IU/L, and 10 IU/L. Thus, anti-HBs titers should be regularly monitored. Nonresponders should be considered for booster vaccinations, alternative <b>vaccination</b> schedules, <b>or</b> prophylactic <b>treatment</b> with a nucleos(t) ide analogue in case of transplantation of an anti-HBc–positive organ...|$|R

However, implementation of new strategies such as <b>vaccination</b> <b>or</b> seasonal <b>treatment</b> of a target population requires the knowledge of baseline epidemiological features of malaria. A population-based {{study was conducted to}} provide better characterization of malaria seasonal variations and population groups the most at risk in this particular area. Methods From July 2007 to December 2009, presumptive cases of malaria among a study population living in a typical Sahelian village of Niger were recorded, and confirmed by microscopic examination. In parallel, asymptomatic carriers were actively detected {{at the end of each}} dry season in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Results Among the 965 presumptive malaria cases recorded, 29 % were confirmed by microscopic examination. The incidence of malaria was found to decrease significantly with age (p Conclusions In Southern Niger, malaria transmission mostly occurs from July to October. Children aged two to ten years are the most at risk of malaria, and may also represent the main reservoir for gametocytes. Strategies such as intermittent preventive treatment in children (IPTc) could be of interest in this area, where malaria transmission is highly seasonal. Based on these preliminary data, a pilot study could be implemented in Zindarou using IPTc targeting children aged two to ten years, during the three months of malaria transmission, together with an accurate monitoring of drug resistance...|$|R
40|$|Reproduction numbers, {{defined as}} averages {{of the number}} of people {{infected}} by a typical case, {{play a central role in}} tracking infectious disease outbreaks. The aim of this paper is to develop methods for estimating reproduction numbers which are simple enough that they could be applied with limited data or in real time during an outbreak. I present a new estimator for the individual reproduction number, which describes the state of the epidemic at a point in time rather than tracking individuals over time, and discuss some potential benefits. Then, to capture more of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important in outbreak dynamics, I analyse a model of transmission within and between households, and develop a method to estimate the household reproduction number, defined as the number of households infected by each infected household. This method is validated by numerical simulations of the spread of influenza and measles using historical data, and estimates are obtained for would-be emerging epidemics of these viruses. I argue that the household reproduction number is useful in assessing the impact of measures that target the household for isolation, quarantine, <b>vaccination</b> <b>or</b> prophylactic <b>treatment,</b> and measures such as social distancing and school or workplace closures which limit between-household transmission, all of which play a key role in current thinking on future infectious disease mitigation...|$|R
40|$|In an era {{of limited}} {{healthcare}} budgets, mathematical models can be useful tools to identify cost-effective programs and to support policymakers in informed decision making. This paper reports results of our work carried out over several years with the Asian Liver Center at Stanford University, a nonprofit outreach and advocacy organization that is an international leader {{in the fight against}} hepatitis B and liver cancer. Hepatitis B is a vaccine-preventable viral disease that, if untreated, can lead to death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. Infection with hepatitis B is a major public health problem, particularly in Asian populations. We used new combinations of decision analysis and Markov models to analyze the cost-effectiveness of several interventions to combat hepatitis B in the United States and China. The results of our OR-based analyses have helped change United States public health policy on hepatitis B screening for millions of people and have helped encourage policymakers in China to enact legislation to provide free catch-up vaccination for hundreds of millions of children. These policies are an important step in eliminating health disparities, reducing discrimination, and ensuring that millions of people who need it can now receive hepatitis B <b>vaccination</b> <b>or</b> lifesaving <b>treatment.</b> DA 015612 - 08 /DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United StatesR 01 DA 015612 /DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United StatesR 18 PS 000830 /PS/NCHHSTP CDC HHS/United StatesR 21 CA 122317 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States 2011 - 07 - 12 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 21760650 PMC 313428...|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{cervical}} cancer disparities in the United States requires intentional focus on structural barriers such as systems and policy that impact access to human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, {{cervical cancer}} screening, and treatment. Such changes are difficult and often politicized. State comprehensive cancer control (CCC) plans are vehicles that, if designed well, can help build collective focus on structural changes. Study objectives were {{to identify the}} prioritization of cervical cancer in state CCC plans, the conceptualization of HPV within these plans, and the focus of plans on structural changes to reduce cervical cancer disparities. Data were gathered by systematic content analysis of CCC plans from 50 states and the District of Columbia from February–June 2014 for evidence of cervical cancer prioritization, conceptualization of HPV, and focus on structural barriers to cervical cancer <b>vaccination,</b> screening <b>or</b> <b>treatment.</b> Findings indicate that prioritization of cervical cancer within state CCC plans {{may not be a}} strong indicator of state efforts to reduce screening and treatment disparities. While a majority of plans reflected scientific evidence that HPV causes cervical and other cancers, they did not focus on structural elements impacting access to evidence-based interventions. Opportunities exist to improve state CCC plans by increasing their focus on structural interventions that impact cervical cancer prevention, detection, and treatment, particularly for the 41 % of plans ending in 2015 and the 31 % ending between 2016 and 2020. Future studies should focus on the use of policy tools in state CCC plans and their application to cervical cancer prevention and treatment...|$|R
