50|$|Each type of {{micrometer}} caliper can be fitted with specialized anvils and spindle tips for particular measuring tasks. For example, the anvil may be shaped {{in the form}} of a segment of screw thread, {{in the form of}} a <b>v-block,</b> or {{in the form of a}} large disc.|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} generally {{relates to}} the remote removal of pelletized samples from cylindrical containment capsules. <b>V-blocks</b> are used to receive the samples and provide guidance to push out rods. Stainless steel liners fit into the v-channels on the <b>v-blocks</b> which permits them to be remotely removed and replaced or cleaned to prevent cross contamination between capsules and samples. A capsule holder securely holds the capsule while allowing manual up/down and in/out movement to align each sample hole with the <b>v-blocks.</b> Both end sections contain identical v-blocks; one that guides the drive out screw and rods or manual push out rods {{and the other to}} receive the samples as they are driven out of the capsule...|$|R
5000|$|<b>V-Blocks</b> are {{precision}} metalworking jigs {{typically used}} to hold round metal rods or pipes for performing drilling or milling operations. They consist of a rectangular steel or cast iron block with a 90-degree channel rotated 45-degrees from the sides, forming a V-shaped channel in the top.

The first mass-produced die-cast aluminum engine, {{it was a}} four-cylinder, 50 horsepower outboard, completely manufactured by OMC, its <b>V-blocks</b> came from Johnson, its steel parts from Evinrude, while the Gale division contributed its carburetors and ignition systems.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]22 LR 96/22 feeds {{from the}} same {{magazines}} as the popular Ruger 10/22 series. From the factory, it comes with the standard flush-fitting 10-round rotary magazine. Since it shares the magazine with the 10/22, the capacities available for the 96/22 include 10, 25, 50, etc. It utilizes the same <b>v-block</b> and barrels from the late model <b>v-block</b> style Ruger 77/22. Because of this, with an allen wrench, the owner can replace the barrel with a 77/22 barrel. To use a 10/22 barrel, the process {{is the same as}} converting a 10/22 barrel for use in a 77/22. Both the 77/22 and 96/22 have dual, opposed extractors. A slot for the left side extractor must be cut into a 10/22 barrel to use it in a 96/22 or 77/22.|$|E
5000|$|V mics {{are outside}} mics {{with a small}} <b>V-block</b> for an anvil.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Determination of the {{integrity}} of any metallic structure is required either to ensure that failure will not occur during the service life of the components (particularly following any weld repair) or to evaluate the lifetime extension of the structure. A portable/in-situ stress-strain microprobe system was developed to evaluate nondestructively in situ {{the integrity}} of metallic components [including base metal, welds, and heat-affected zones (HAZs) ] The microprobe system utilizes an innovative automated ball indentation (ABI) technique to determine several key mechanical properties (yield strength, true-stress/true-plastic-strain curve, strain-hardening exponent, Lüders strain, elastic modulus, and {{an estimate of the}} local fracture toughness). This paper presents ABI test results from several metallic samples. The microprobe system was used successfully to nondestructively test in-situ a circumferentially welded Type 347 stainless steel pipe. Four <b>V-blocks</b> were used to mount the testing head of the microprobe system, allowing a 360 ° inspection of property gradients in the weld and its HAZ...|$|R
50|$|The Orenda OE600 is a 600 hp-class liquid-cooled 8-cylinder <b>V-block</b> {{aircraft}} engine intended to re-introduce piston power to aircraft normally {{powered by the}} famous Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 turboprop.

However, changes in Orenda's business in the post-9/11 time frame led to the project being canceled.|$|E
50|$|Since inline {{engines of}} more than 6 {{cylinders}} tend to have substantial technical problems, and since GM was not to perfect <b>V-block</b> engine technology for another decade, they took two divergent approaches to achieving higher horsepower. One was to couple together multiple 6-71 engines in twin (side-by-side), tandem (fore-and-aft) and the incredible Quad (four 6-71s all driving a single shaft). While these did produce high horsepower and even added some redundancy, they were mechanically complex and relatively expensive.|$|E
5000|$|The Detroit Diesel Series 92 is a {{two-stroke}} cycle, <b>V-block</b> diesel engine, {{produced with}} versions ranging {{from six to}} 16 cylinders. Among these, the most popular were the 6V92 and 8V92, which were V6 and V8 configurations of the same engine respectively. The series was introduced in 1974. It was a rebored (4.84025±.00125") version of its then-popular sister series (retaining the 5" [...] piston stroke yielding 92.0 cu in), the Series 71. Both the 71 and 92 series engines were popularly used in on-highway vehicle applications.|$|E
40|$|Silicon carbide (SiC) is {{well known}} for its large {{potentiality}} for power device applications. SiC presents a high critical electric field, allowing small dimensions and relatively high doping levels, favorable for reduced power losses in the on-state together with high blocking voltage capability. SIC has a wide band-gap, inducing very low intrinsic carrier concentrations even at high temperature. and consequently allows very low leakage currents and off-state pou sr losses. The present paper focuses on problems related to the high voltage capability of SiC components. After dealing with the bulk breakdown voltage of a SiC semi-infinite parallel-plane abrupt junction, a short review of the methods allowing the potential distribution spreading near the periphery of the real junction is given. Some methods have been implemented and the edge-termination protection has been optimized by the way of numerical simulation. This includes equipotential rings, junction termination extension as planar protections, and MESA as an etched-contour periphery. Examples of realizations are given, and electrical characteristics are presented. They show a better capability of the junction termination extension periphery over the MESA technique to reach a 1500 <b>V-blocking</b> voltage objective...|$|R

5000|$|These engines have a 90° <b>v-block</b> with 12 valves {{activated}} by a pushrod valvetrain. All engines have cast iron blocks and cylinder heads. The engines {{are based on}} the Chevrolet Small-Block engine, and the V6 is formed by the removal of the #3 and #6 cylinders. The V6s share the same 4.4-inch bore spacing and 9.025-inch deck height as the V8 engines. Many parts are interchangeable between the 90° V6 and the small block V8 including valvetrain components, bearings, piston assemblies, lubrication and cooling system components, and external accessories. [...] The 90-degree V6 engine uses the same transmission bellhousing pattern as the Chevrolet small-block V8 engine. The oil pan dipstick is located on the passenger side above the oil pan rail; this design was phased in on both the V6-90 and Small Block Chevrolet assembly lines (for engines manufactured after 1979) sharing the same casting dies. All the engines use a 1-6-5-4-3-2 firing order. The engines in this family are longitudinal engines, and have been used in rear-wheel drive cars and trucks, industrial, and marine applications. As of 2012, the Chevrolet 90° V6 is currently produced at the GM Powertrain Division plant in Romulus, Michigan.|$|E

5000|$|The 10/22 was {{immediately}} popular upon its release. It {{was designed as}} a quality adult gun (with adult ergonomics) and not a cheap [...] "youth rifle". However, its easy handling characteristics, negligible recoil and inexpensive ammunition nonetheless make it ideal for young or inexperienced shooters. It is very popular for small-game hunters and those who want an inexpensive rifle firing inexpensive ammunition for target and plinking use. This popularity has led to many after-market modifications being available to improve performance, augment the rifle's looks, or increase its magazine capacity, leading the 10/22 {{to be one of the}} most customizable firearms made.Custom manufacturers also make [...] "clones" [...] of the 10/22, which are similar in design (most parts will interchange) but built to much higher specifications and costs. The 10/22 barrel uses a unique two-screw, <b>V-block</b> system to attach the barrel to the receiver, making removal and replacement of the barrel (which would require a gunsmith's work with most other rifles) very easy. This, when combined with the simple construction of the rest of the components, means that the average person can easily replace any part in the gun with nothing more than a screwdriver, a hex key and simple punches.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{relates to}} the problem of {{adaptation}} of <b>V-block</b> methods to waviness measurements of cylindrical surfaces. It presents the fundamentals of <b>V-block</b> methods and the principle of their application. The <b>V-block</b> methods can be successfully used to measure the roundness and waviness deviations of large cylinders used in paper industry, shipping industry, or in metallurgy. The concept of adaptation of the <b>V-block</b> method to waviness measurements of cylindrical surfaces was verified using computer simulations and experimental work. The computer simulation was carried out in order to check whether the proposed mathematical model and <b>V-block</b> method parameters are correct. Based on the simulation results, a model of measuring device ROL- 2 for <b>V-block</b> waviness measurements was developed. Next, experimental research was carried out consisting in evaluation of waviness deviation, initially using a standard non-reference measuring device, and then using the tested device based on the <b>V-block</b> method.

40|$|Interfacial {{temperatures}} attained in a pin and <b>v-block</b> apparatus under extreme pres-sure (EP) {{conditions were}} measured using pins made from either copper or an aluminum alloy from the asymptotes in {{the curve of}} removal rate versus applied load since these {{have been shown to}} correspond to the temperatures at which the interfacial material melts. The interfacial temperature rise was proportional to the applied load, where the proportionality constant a = A # where # is the interfacial friction coefficient and A a geometrical constant which has been previously measured for steel pins and v-blocks lubricated by chlorinated hydrocarbons dissolved in a poly a-olefm as 2. 3 4 - 0. 3 K/N. Values of A measured when using the aluminum alloy (2. 4 4 - 0. 1) and for copper (2. 1 - 4 - 0. 2) were in good agreement with this measurement and indicated that interfacial temperatures in excess of 1000 K can be attained uring EP lubrication.

40|$|Rotating {{accuracy}} of a rolling bearing {{is comprised of}} repetitive run-out(RRO) and non-repetitive run-out(NRRO). Several reasons for non-repetitive run-out are as follows; irregular alignment of rolling elements, mutual difference of each diameter of rolling elements, form error of a rolling and variation of retainer, etc. In this research, we focus attention on diametrical change of rolling elements(steel balls). In fact, we had observed quantitative diametrical change of steel balls, which were left under high temperature for long period of time. A measuring device with 0. 1 μm resolution using <b>V-block</b> method was designed and constructed. The systematic error for measurement of diametrical change was considered theoretically by using geometrical relationship between <b>V-block</b> surface and sphere(steel ball) surface to be measured. Thus, we clarified {{that the effect of}} measuring error could be neglected. Furthermore, steel balls were left in 120 degree-C temperature environment simulating actual usage for four months and their diametrical changes were measured every one month. Based on the experimental observation, we found that the diameter of a ball made of SUJ 2 increased with time. The diameter of a ball made of SUS 440 C was decreased with time initially and its change was gradual after that.

The lubricating wear test was performed under different experimental conditions using the Falex wear test of the Pin and <b>V-Block</b> types by Ti(C,N) coated.

30|$|This paper {{traces the}} DMAIC {{approach}} {{for improving the}} process capability levels of the stub-end-hole boring operation of the crankshaft manufacturing process. The QC tools predominantly used for tracing out the causes for poor process performance are the Ishikawa diagram, physical mechanism analysis and the failure modes and effects analysis. The process monitoring charts are employed at the workplace for monitoring the process performance and preventing it from deviations. In order to trace out the extent of influence of the causes identified, the ANOVA procedure is adopted. The predominant causes identified are worn out cutting tool inserts, worn out insert setting <b>v-block</b> and non-calibration of the vernier calipers and tool setting mandrel. Finally, on eliminating the causes one-by-one, the process potential capability index (CP) showed an improvement from 1.29 to 2.02 and the process performance capability index (CPK) improved from 0.32 to 1.45.|$|E

40|$|Friction {{coefficient}} {{between a}} circular-disk periphery and <b>V-block</b> surface {{was determined by}} introducing the concept of isotropic point (IP) in isochromatic field of the disk under three-point symmetric loading. IP position on the symmetry axis depends on active coefficient of friction during experiment. We extend this work to asymmetric loading of circular disk in which case two frictional contact pairs out of three loading contacts, independently control the unconstrained IP location. Photoelastic experiment is conducted on particular case of asymmetric three-point loading of circular disk. Basics of digital image processing are used to extract few essential parameters from experimental image, particularly IP location. Analytical solution by Flamant for half plane with a concentrated load, is utilized to derive stress components for required loading configurations of the disk. IP is observed, in analytical simulations of three-point asymmetric normal loading, to move from vertical axis to the boundary along an ellipse-like curve. When friction {{is included in the}} analysis, IP approaches the center with increase in loading friction and it goes away with increase in support friction. With all these insights, using experimental IP information, friction angles at three contact pairs of circular disk under asymmetric loading, are determined...|$|E
40|$|Molecular beam studies {{carried out}} in {{ultrahigh}} vacuum show that dimethyl disulfide reacts with initially clean iron to evolve methane. The reaction is proposed to proceed via a methyl thiolate intermediate. Reaction ceases at ∼ 600 K, an effect that is proposed {{to be due to}} the surface being blocked by an overlayer of sulfur and carbon. Reaction recommences above ∼ 950 K as sulfur diffuses into the iron. The activation energy for the film-forming reaction is 52. 5 ± 2. 1 kcal/mol, in good agreement with the activation energy for the growth of FeS films from dimethyl disulfide at higher pressures measured using a microbalance. A depth profile of the film grown in ultrahigh vacuum shows that the sulfur-containing film grows on a Fe + C underlayer. Similar molecular beam experiments with diethyl disulfide suggest the formation of an intermediate ethyl thiolate species which decomposes via a β-hydride elimination reaction to evolve ethylene. The activation energy for film growth, in this case, is 60 ± 2. 4 kcal/mol. The results of tribological experiments using a pin and <b>v-block</b> apparatus are consistent with FeS forming the anti-seizure film.

40|$|Abstract − In many {{industries}} (for example, in paper, electric or ship industry), {{large and}} heavy cylindrical elements play very important role. Such workpieces should posses very good quality {{of form and}} dimensions. Sometimes, they may be deformed under certain operating conditions, e. g. due to a high temperature or great external or internal loads. Consequently, wear and damage of the working surfaces are observed. Therefore cylindricity deviations of such workpieces should be measured during their manufacturing and exploitation. However, some of the workpieces cannot be measured accurately by existing measuring instruments because they are too large or too heavy and therefore they cannot {{be placed on the}} measuring table of the instrument. This is why the industries manufacturing or applying cylinders expect that measurements of cylindricity profiles will be made directly on the machine tool or in the work area. In the paper methods allowing such measurements are investigated. The methods are divided into two main groups: multisensor and <b>V-block</b> methods. Most important advantages and disadvantages of both groups of methods allowing accurate in situ cylindricity measurements are given as conclusions. The radius change measurements of cylindricity profiles are of a high metrological level. Characterised by high accuracy, they provide complete information of the analysed surface. However, the radius change measuring instruments are applied only if it is possible to place the workpiece on the measuring table...|$|E
40|$|The {{tribological}} {{properties of}} FeCl 2, measured using an ultrahigh vacuum tribometer, are {{compared with those}} of KCl. The friction coefficient of an FeCl 2 film evaporated onto iron in ultrahigh vacuum decreases to ∼ 0. 08 after the deposition of a film ∼ 40 Å thick. This value is in good agreement with that measured for reactively formed FeCl 2 films in a pin and <b>v-block</b> apparatus. The contact resistance also increases at the same FeCl 2 thickness as that at which the friction coefficient reaches its minimum value suggesting that this corresponds to the completion of the first monolayer as found previously for KCl. Comparison of the friction coefficients and contact resistances for a second pass suggests that the film is mobile during rubbing in both cases. It is found that repeated rubbing in the case of FeCl 2 leads to a reduction in friction coefficient to ∼ 0. 015 which is shown to be due to the formation of a transfer film on the tribotip. In contrast, no such reduction is found for a KCl film up to 40 cycles, implying that no transfer film is formed in that case. It is also found that, while friction reduction requires the surface to be completely covered by the halide film, suppression of damage in the iron requires the deposition of films thicker than ∼ 500 Å...|$|E
