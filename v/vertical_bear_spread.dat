5000|$|In options trading, a jade lizard is {{a custom}} option {{strategy}} {{which consists of}} a <b>bear</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>spread</b> created using call options, {{with the addition of}} a put option sold at a strike price lower than the strike prices of the call spread. For one underlying security, same expiration date, this strategy consists of buying a call option at one strike price, selling another call option at a lower strike price, then selling an OTM put option at a strike price lower than that of both call options. The addition of the sale of a put option is consistent with the expected move of the underlying and results in additional premium collected. The jade lizard strategy takes advantage of the volatility skew inherently priced into options with naked puts trading richer in premium than naked calls and short call spreads trading richer in premium than short put spreads. This volatility skew effect allows the trader to collect more premium for the overall position and thus, increasing the position's probability of profit. The term [...] "jade lizard" [...] was first used by former CBOE floor traders, Liz Dierking and Jenny Andrews, on the Liz & Jny Show on the Tastytrade Network.|$|R

40|$|A superreplicating hedging {{strategy}} {{is commonly used}} when delta hedging is infeasible or is too expensive. This article provides an exact analytical solution to the superreplication problem for a class of derivative asset payoffs. The class contains common payoffs that are neither uniformly convex nor concave. A digital option, a bull <b>spread,</b> a <b>bear</b> <b>spread,</b> and some portfolios of bull <b>spreads</b> or <b>bear</b> <b>spreads,</b> are all included as special cases. The problem is approached by first solving for the transition density of a process that has a two-valued volatility. Using this process to model the underlying asset and identifying the two volatility values as σmin and σmax, the value function for any derivative asset in the class is shown to solve the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation. The subreplication problem and several related extensions, such as option pricing with transaction costs, calculating superreplicating bounds, and superreplication with multiple risky assets, are also addressed. Superreplication, subreplication, uncertain volatility, Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation, transaction costs,...|$|R

5000|$|The {{position}} is {{so named because}} of {{the shape of the}} profit/loss graph, which loosely resembles a large-bodied bird, such as a condor. In keeping with this analogy, traders often refer to the inner options collectively as the [...] "body" [...] and the outer options as the [...] "wings". The word iron in the name of this position indicates that, like an iron butterfly, this {{position is}} constructed using both calls and puts, by combining a bull put <b>spread</b> with a <b>bear</b> call <b>spread.</b> The combination of these two credit spreads makes the long iron condor (and the long iron butterfly) a credit spread, {{despite the fact that it}} is [...] "long." [...] This distinguishes the position from a plain Condor position (and the plain Butterfly), which would be constructed with all calls or all puts, by combining either a bull call <b>spread</b> with a <b>bear</b> call <b>spread</b> or a bull put <b>spread</b> with a <b>bear</b> put <b>spread.</b> Because the long, plain Condor (and Butterfly) combine a debit spread with a credit spread, that overall position is instead entered at a net debit (though usually small).|$|R

5000|$|In options trading, a {{box spread}} is a {{combination}} of positions that has a certain (i.e. riskless) payoff, considered to be simply [...] "delta neutral interest rate position". For example, a bull spread constructed from calls (e.g. long a 50 call, short a 60 call) combined with a <b>bear</b> <b>spread</b> constructed from puts (e.g. long a 60 put, short a 50 put) has a constant payoff of the difference in exercise prices (e.g. 10) assuming that the underlying stock does not go ex-dividend before the expiration of the options. If the underlying asset has a dividend of x, then the settled value of the box will be 10+x.
