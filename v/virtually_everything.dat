5|$|As part of William III and Mary II's {{coronation}} honours, Churchill {{was created}} Earl of Marlborough on 9 April 1689 (O.S.); {{he was also}} sworn {{as a member of}} the Privy Council and made a Gentleman of the King's Bedchamber. His elevation, however, led to accusatory rumours from King James's supporters that Marlborough had disgracefully betrayed his erstwhile king for personal gain; William himself entertained reservations about the man who had deserted James. Marlborough's apologists though, including his most notable descendant and biographer Winston Churchill, have been at pains to attribute patriotic, religious, and moral motives to his action; but in the words of Chandler, it is difficult to absolve Marlborough of ruthlessness, ingratitude, intrigue and treachery against a man to whom he owed <b>virtually</b> <b>everything</b> in his life and career to date.|$|E
5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that the olive baboon is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition in almost any environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not look for food on the ground. The olive baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats <b>virtually</b> <b>everything</b> it finds.|$|E

5000|$|In 1964 John Bell {{discovered}} that nature is non-local, that is, actions in one location instantaneously {{have an effect}} in a distant region, in apparent contradiction of Einstein’s relativity according to which no signals can propagate faster than light. What Bell discovered is that non-local (i.e. seemingly instantaneous) effects can nevertheless exist {{under the cover of}} quantum uncertainties. It is hard to overestimate the importance of this discovery for the entire physics. Arguably, it is probably on a par with Einstein discovery of relativity itself. Yet for almost three decades, with a few notable exceptions, Bell’s discovery remained <b>virtually</b> unnoticed. <b>Everything</b> changed however with the work of Nicolas Gisin 25. Up to that moment it was known that non-locality arises in one extremely particular situation. Nicolas Gisin, however, showed that non-locality is generic: (almost) all pure quantum states generate non-locality. Gisin theorem [...] therefore puts non-locality at the core of physics.|$|R

The German founding fathers undermined the principles behind the legalistic process, which was based on a belief in an unbroken tradition through the ages merely elaborated and applied to novel circumstances rather than subject to change. Rabbi Samuel Holdheim advocated a particularly radical stance, arguing that the halakhic Law of the Land is Law principle must be universally applied and subject <b>virtually</b> <b>everything</b> to current norms and needs, far beyond its weight in conventional Jewish Law.|$|E

40|$|Maldives is {{an island}} nation that {{consists}} of around 1190 islands located in the Indian Ocean, southwest of Sri Lanka. The country <b>virtually</b> imports <b>everything</b> it consumes. Male’ Commercial Harbour handles all international sea cargo for the country. The land area assigned for the port is small; and there are frequent bottlenecks and congestion in the port. By using computer simulation techniques, this research investigates the situation of Male’ Commercial Harbour and identifies logistic bottlenecks that exist at the port. Accordingly, a field research was conducted at Male’ Commercial Harbour to collect required data. Both, qualitative and quantitative data were collected using focus group, interviews, on-site observations, and time and motion measures. The simulation models presented in this thesis were carried out with Arena software (Academic Version of Arena 10. 0). The models were used to analyse the vessel turnaround time, berth capacity, yard capacity, container dwell time, queue values, utilisation of ship cranes and other container handling equipment. The results show that berth capacity {{seems to be the}} major bottleneck that creates longer queues and ship delays at Male’ Commercial Harbour. Several scenarios were tested to identify the best scenario regarding ship waiting time at berth. Based on the best scenario, a project was proposed focusing on the development of an extended alongside berth at Male’ Commercial Harbour. A cost benefit analysis was performed to see whether the project is financially feasible...|$|R

He felt called upon to use his learning in a purification of the doctrine by returning to the historic documents and original languages of sacred Scripture. He tried to free the methods of scholarship from the rigidity and formalism of medieval traditions, {{but he was not}} satisfied with this. His revolt against certain forms of Christian monasticism and scholasticism was not based on doubts about the truth of doctrine, nor from hostility to the organization of the Church itself, nor from rejection of celibacy or monastical lifestyles. He saw himself as a preacher of righteousness by an appeal to reason, applied frankly and without fear of the magisterium. He always intended to remain faithful to Catholic doctrine, and therefore was convinced he could criticize frankly <b>virtually</b> everyone and <b>everything.</b> Aloof from entangling obligations, Erasmus was the centre of the literary movement of his time, corresponding with more than five hundred men in the worlds of politics and of thought.|$|R

First, the issues that organizations must address can easily be interpreted to include <b>virtually</b> everyone and <b>everything.</b> Second, with their unique, often particular characteristics, different stakeholder groups tend to focus only on specific issues that they believe are the most appropriate and relevant in organizations' corporate social responsibility programs.

Third, in any organization, the beliefs of organizational members about their organization's social responsibilities vary according to their function and department, as well as their own managerial fields of knowledge. A Stakeholder Approach to Corporate Social Responsibility provides a comprehensive collection of cutting-edge theories and research that can lead to a more multifaceted understanding of corporate social responsibility in its various forms, the pressures and conflicts that result from these different understandings, and some potential solutions for reconciling them...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{idea for the}} project was developed by John & Kalassu Wintergate {{at the end of}} 1978 and the script was started with the idea to film a comedy horror movie. A year or so later Elliot Van Koghbe read an article in American Cinematographer. The article mentioned that George Lucas was experimenting with producing films shot originally on video. Wintergate also had the same idea, because the large funds for a 35 mm production was not yet available. So after researching the idea more closely Wintergate decided to venture into producing a low-budget comedy horror film on video reserving the major portion of the budget for the expense of making the transfer to film. J & K Wintergate funded the project and wrote the script. As an assistant casting director in Hollywood, Van Koghbe had experience with video equipment that was helpful. He, under an alternate name (Obee Ray), also shot a couple of extra sequences for the eventual re-edit which the distributer insisted on. The distributor, {{in order to make it}} strictly horror, insisted for most of the real comedy scenes to be cut, which of course ended up to be <b>virtually</b> impossible since <b>everything</b> was shot with the underlying comedy aspect. This made it into a quirky somewhat puzzling film but it inadvertently helped the film to become an eventual cult classic all over the world.|$|R
40|$|Information {{is usually}} related to knowledge. However, the recent {{development}} of information theory demonstrated {{that information is}} a much broader concept, being actually present in and <b>virtually</b> related to <b>everything.</b> As a result, many unknown types and kinds of information have been discovered. Nevertheless, information that acts on knowledge, bringing new and updating existing knowledge, is of primary importance to people. It is called epistemic information, which is studied in this paper based on {{the general theory of}} information and further developing its mathematical stratum. As a synthetic approach, which reveals the essence of information, organizing and encompassing all main directions in information theory, the general theory of information provides efficient means for such a study. Different types of information dynamics representation use tools of mathematical disciplines such as the theory of categories, functional analysis, mathematical logic and algebra. Here we employ algebraic structures for exploration of information and knowledge dynamics. In Introduction (Section 1), we discuss previous studies of epistemic information. Section 2 gives a compressed description of the parametric phenomenological definition of information in the general theory of information. In Section 3, anthropic information, which is received, exchanged, processed and used by people is singled out and studied based on the Componential Triune Brain model. One of the basic forms of anthropic information called epistemic information, which is related to knowledge, is analyzed in Section 4. Mathematical models of epistemic information are studied in Section 5. In Conclusion, some open problems related to epistemic information are given...|$|R

40|$|Short {{of divine}} intervention, science is our {{only hope for}} finding "best {{practices}} " that prevent immediate acts of suicidal behavior and reduce their overall rate. The essential qualities of science — that dis tin-guish es it from superstition or dogma — are {{that there must be}} well formulated research hypotheses and they must be tested using established techniques that minimize subjectivity and other biases. The test results, whether supportive or not, are evidence. Proof requires, at a minimum, a consistent convergence of many sources of evidence. In the physical sciences (e. g., chemistry, physics, etc.) in particular, the word "proof " might only be used when the evidence is <b>virtually</b> irrefutable. Like <b>everything</b> human, science occurs in a context. Which research questions are asked and which questions receive funding is often influenced by essentially political considerations, even from within science. Being human, scientists may sometimes use such words as "proof " and "evidence " in ways that, knowingly or unknowingly, suit their own or others political purposes. Even when science isn't unduly influenced by politics, the science of any era operates under the influence of like-minded assumptions about the world (par a digms, as Kuhn, 1970, named them) that are hard to change. For example, the evidence for "lunacy " is no longer acceptable although some still consider research on the timing of suicide deaths and phases of the moon to be important. Similarly, there have been assumptions about the limited number of correct models for doing science that are hard to change. Research-based evidence usually assumes the application of two standard models...|$|R
40|$|Theology and {{philosophy}} establish that kenosis, or self-emptying, reveals the ontology of creativity. But, until now, architecture – a primal expression of human creativity – {{has not been}} correlated with kenosis, nor has either been thought of as informing or taking {{the measure of the}} other. This dissertation moves toward rectifying that lack. It opens-up interdisciplinary thinking about kenosis to reveal the subject’s manifold foundations: its locus classicus in Christian scriptures, its antecedents in antiquity, its medieval and modern development, and its emergence in most major faith traditions. Such foundations enable a further opening-up of kenotic thought – for the first time, through architecture. Accordingly, the situations of eight, widely recognised architectural projects are re-examined, this time focusing on their kenotic claims and the kenosis they manifest. Located in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia – where several are affected by the kenotic dimensions of various world religions – these projects include works by Louis Kahn, I. M. Pei, Tadao Ando, Daniel Libeskind, and Peter Eisenman. Though newly revealing, this examination often mirrors the kenosis it seeks – holding the originating questions open, and opening-up still others. In fact, this thinking about kenosis through architecture ultimately turns, and opens-up a unique thinking about architecture through kenosis – extending to architecture’s very being. Kenotic emptiness asks of architecture’s fullness, of the barriers to architecture’s own kenosis. And it asks how such a kenosis might influence an increasingly secularised, globalised, and environmentalised – indeed, aestheticised – world. Questions of kenosis, creativity, and architecture are explored in the interest of elevating humanity’s thinking about the aesthetisation of culture; a critical pursuit, worthy to be critically considered, since such thinking affects <b>virtually</b> everyone and <b>everything...</b>|$|R

While contemplating suicide after the accidental death of his wife and unborn child, he was met by the Spectre, who told him about Terry Sloane. Inspired by Sloane's life story, he took the name [...] "Mister Terrific" [...] and later joined the current Justice Society of America, eventually serving as its chairman. He is the inventor of the T-Sphere, an artificially intelligent miniature device that he controls with his mask and earpieces. The T-Sphere can fly, create holographic images, project beams of light, release electrical charges, tie into computers and GPS satellites, and constantly cloaks Holt against detection and the recording of his image by any and all technological, non-organic means making him <b>virtually</b> invisible to <b>everything</b> but human line of sight. In the past, he has used them for reconnaissance, infiltration, espionage and information retrieval and storage, often multi-tasking his T-Spheres to all go off on different tasks at once.

While his illness and his love-affairs conform to some of the stereotypes of romanticism, the rarity of his public recitals (as opposed to performances at fashionable Paris soirées) led Arthur Hutchings to suggest that [...] "his lack of Byronic flamboyance [...] his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional" [...] among his romantic contemporaries, such as Liszt and Henri Herz.|$|E

60|$|My Lords, {{there is}} another consideration, which augments the solicitude of the Commons, equal to those other two great {{interests}} I have stated, those of our empire and our national character,--something that, if possible, comes more home to the hearts and feelings of every Englishman: I mean, the interests of our Constitution itself, which is {{deeply involved in the}} event of this cause. The future use and the whole effect, if not the very existence, of the process of an impeachment of high crimes and misdemeanors before the peers of this kingdom upon the charge of the Commons will very much be decided by your judgment in this cause. This tribunal will be found (I hope it will always be found) too great for petty causes: if it should at the same time be found incompetent to one of the greatest,--that is, if little offences, from their minuteness, escape you, and the greatest, from their magnitude, oppress you,--it is impossible that this form of trial should not in the end vanish out of the Constitution. For we must not deceive ourselves: whatever does not stand with credit cannot stand long. And if the Constitution should be deprived, I do not mean in form, but virtually, of this resource, it is <b>virtually</b> deprived of <b>everything</b> else that is valuable in it. For this process is the cement which binds the whole together; this is the individuating principle that makes England what England is. In this court it is that no subject, in no part of the empire, can fail of competent and proportionable justice; here it is that we provide for that which is the substantial excellence of our Constitution,--I mean, the great circulation of responsibility, by which (excepting the supreme power) no man, in no circumstance, can escape the account which he owes to the laws of his country. It is by this process that magistracy, which tries and controls all other things, is itself tried and controlled. Other constitutions are satisfied with making good subjects; this is a security for good governors. It is by this tribunal that statesmen who abuse their power are accused by statesmen and tried by statesmen, not upon the niceties of a narrow jurisprudence, but upon the enlarged and solid principles of state morality. It is here that those who by the abuse of power have violated the spirit of law can never hope for protection from any of its forms; it is here that those who have refused to conform themselves to its perfections can never hope to escape through any of its defects. It ought, therefore, my Lords, to become our common care to guard this your precious deposit, rare in its use, but powerful in its effect, with a religious vigilance, and never to suffer it to be either discredited or antiquated. For this great end your Lordships are invested with great and plenary powers: but you do not suspend, you do not supersede, you do not annihilate any subordinate jurisdiction; on the contrary, you are auxiliary and supplemental to them all.|$|R

Alexis Petridis of The Guardian found it [...] "packing an immensely addictive melody or an inescapable hook, <b>virtually</b> <b>everything</b> sounds like another hit single", and predicted that it [...] "certainly sounds like it could be big." [...] Daniel Brockman from The Phoenix wrote that [...] "Gaga ups the ante in terms of catchy songwriting and sheer high-in-the-club-banging-to-the-beat abandon." [...] Ben Hogwood of musicOMH praised Gaga's [...] "blend of sassy attitude, metallic beats and sharp, incisive songwriting", elements which he felt are integral to [...] "creating pop music".|$|E
