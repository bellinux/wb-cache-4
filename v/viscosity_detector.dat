40|$|Size {{exclusion}} chromatography (SEC) {{is shown}} {{to be an effective}} method to characterize single-wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) dispersions. SEC separates nanotube dispersions by size, and an on-line <b>viscosity</b> <b>detector</b> gives intrinsic viscosity as a function of hydrodynamic size, as is determined by universal calibration. The scaling contains information about the shape of the dispersed particles. This characterization method was tested on three representative dispersions, octadecylamine functionalization (SWNT-ODA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), butyl group functionalization (SWNT-butyl) in THF, and DNA wrapping (SWNT/DNA) in aqueous solution. Significant differences between the dispersions were found. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) produced results consistent with the SEC method...|$|E
40|$|The {{detailed}} {{characterization of}} polymer and copolymer mixtures requires {{the determination of}} both molecular weight and chemical composition. Such information {{can be obtained from}} the combination of size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and thermal field-flow fractionation (ThFFF) with mass and <b>viscosity</b> <b>detectors.</b> In the first step of the method, polymer standards and the concept of universal calibration are used to define the dependence of retention on the diffusion coefficient D in an SEC column. Next, the SEC column is used to separate a polymer mixture into elution slices that each have a unique and definable D value. These slices are collected and individually cross-fractionated according to chemical composition by ThFFF. Values of D are combined with measurements of intrinsic viscosity to yield the molecular weight of the resulting fractions. The D value of a separated fraction is combined with its ThFFF retention parameter to yield an associated thermal diffusion coefficient, from which the fraction 2 ̆ 7 s chemical composition is obtained. The method is demonstrated with blends of polystyrene-ethylene oxide copolymers and their corresponding homopolymers...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) are challenging to measure, as macromolecular solutes in blood may be metabolized or transported by various cells in the kidney. Urinary solute concentrations generally reflect the cumulative influence of multiple transport processes rather than the intrinsic behavior of the GFB alone. Synthetic tracer molecules which are not secreted, absorbed, or modified by the kidney are useful tools. Ficoll, a globular polymer of epichlorohydrin and sucrose, is round, physiologically inert, and easily labeled, making it a nearly ideal glomerular probe. Fissell et al. reported filtration data suggesting that Ficoll was not as spherical as had been previously suggested (Fissell WH, Manley S, Dubnisheva A, Glass J, Magistrelli J, Eldridge AN, Fleischman AJ, Zydney AL, Roy S. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 293 : F 1209 –F 1213, 2007). More recently, two investigators published comparisons of neutral and anionic Ficoll clearance that suggest Ficoll may undergo conformational changes when chemically derivatized (Asgeirsson D, Venturoli D, Rippe B, Rippe C. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 291 : F 1083 –F 1089, 2006; Guimaraes MAM, Nikolovski J, Pratt LM, Greive K, Comper WD. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 285 : F 1118 –F 1124, 2003). To investigate Ficoll's characteristics further, we examined two commercial preparations, Ficoll 70 and Ficoll 400, by size-exclusion chromatography using a differential refractive index detector combined with light-scattering and <b>viscosity</b> <b>detectors.</b> A slope of 0. 45 {{was obtained from the}} plot of the logarithm of molecular mass against the logarithm of root-mean square radius. The Mark-Houwink exponent values of 0. 34 and 0. 36 were calculated for Ficoll 70 and Ficoll 400, respectively. These results suggest Ficoll's conformation in physiological saline solution is likely intermediate between a solid sphere and a well-solvated linear random coil. The measurements help explain our previous observations and guide interpretation of in vivo experiments...|$|R
40|$|Chitosans are {{considered}} promising {{for a wide}} range of applications, and especially in the biomedical and pharmaceutical field numerous possible applications are being investigated. However, some of the properties of chitosans are not ideal for biomedical applications. Most high molecular weight chitosans are insoluble near and above physiological pH, limiting its uses. Moreover, the relatively high stiffness of chitosan chains restricts their electrostatic interactions with polyanions. To overcome this problem, chemical modification is an important approach. The main objective of this work has been to obtain well-characterised modified chitosans with increased solubility and chain flexibility suitable for potential use in biomedical applications, with periodate oxidation being the chosen method of chemically modification. In order to obtain an improved basis for producing high molecular weight, periodate oxidised chitosans, the kinetics and stoichiometry of the reaction, and the effect of the experimental conditions on the reaction product, were investigated. Chitosans became only partially oxidised during the oxidation with periodate, reaching degrees of oxidation around 0. 5, when oxidised with excess periodate. Chitosans were severely depolymerised during the oxidation, and the large overconsumption of periodate observed, can probably be explained by the consumption of periodate at the increasing number of end groups. Free radical mediated depolymerisation seems not to be sufficient to explain the depolymerisation, and a chitosan specific degradation mechanism is probably involved in the depolymerisation. The reaction rates, overconsumption of periodate, and depolymerisation all increased with decreasing F A. No methods to considerably reduce the depolymerisation were found. The resulting periodate oxidised chitosans were characterised by investigating the chain stiffness, water-solubility and chemical structure. The chain stiffness was measured using size-exclusion chromatography combined with light-scattering and <b>viscosity</b> <b>detectors</b> (SEC-MALLS-VISC), and it was found that the persistent length, q, decreased with increasing degrees of oxidation. The water-solubility of periodate oxidised chitosans with F A = 0. 01 and F A = 0. 16 increased with increasing degrees of oxidation, and were completely soluble at F ox = 0. 10. Chitosans and periodate oxidised chitosans with F A = 0. 52 were completely soluble at all pH-values investigated. Thus, periodate oxidised chitosans with increased solubility and chain flexibility were obtained, but the molecular weight could not be retained. The chemical structure was investigated by NMR spectroscopy, but more work remains before any conclusions can be drawn. The chain stiffness of chitosans with different chemical composition was investigated. Persistence lengths and exponents from double logarithmic plots of [η]-M and R G -M indicate that the chain stiffness is independent of F A, with average q-values of 7 nm, avalues of 0. 78 and a’-values 0. 56. To support the methods used and to get a standard of reference the periodate oxidation of alginates, which are more studied than chitosans, was also undertaken and the resulting products characterised. The reaction rates, dPt/dt, in the periodate oxidation of alginates were highly dependent on the type of alginate used and the concentration of the polymer. The chain stiffness was investigated by SEC-MALLS-VISC, and clearly showed that the persistence length decreased with increasing degrees of oxidation. For use in biomedical applications chitosans have to be pure and well characterised with documented safety profiles. Impurities like metal ion contamination must be strictly controlled. An additional objective of this work was to gain a better understanding of the binding of ions to chitosans, and to develop a method to measure the selective ionbinding properties. A method was successfully developed. No selectivity in the binding of chloride and nitrate ions to chitosan was observed. Molybdate anions were selectively bound to chitosans in the presence of excess nitrate or chloride ions, with selectivity coefficients around 100. Cu 2 + ions were bound selectively to chitosan in the presence of Ni 2 +, Zn 2 + or Cd 2 + ions, with selectivity coefficients in the range 10 to 1000. Chitosans with low and high FA did not show any difference in their selectivity towards ions. Binding of metal cations increased with pH indicating that only the deprotonised amino groups can bind the ions. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

The {{molecular}} weight and {{molecular weight}} distribution (MWD) of polycarboxylate superplasticizer (PCE) was measured by gel permeation chromatograph (GPC) which combined three different detectors, namely refractive index detector (RI), laser light scattering detector (LS) and <b>viscosity</b> <b>detector</b> (VIS). By conducting numerous experiments, what the different peak stand for in the chromatogram was verified and the best sample concentration range in the GPC experiment was also determined.

The viscometer consists of four equal flow restrictions and two pressure sensors, connected in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. Since this viscometer requires an ultra-low hydraulic capacitance differential pressure sensor, a pressure sensor is presented of which the internal volume displacement was reduced considerably compared to commercially available sensors. An optical method was used to detect membrane deflections with a magnitude of approximately 0. 01 nm. This method lead to a linearity of 1 % over the measured pressure range and a resolution of 2 Pa.

These parameters were readily obtained using size-exclusion chromatography with an online multi-angle laser light scattering detector, a <b>viscosity</b> <b>detector,</b> and a concentration sensitive detector. The electrostatic contribution to the total persistence length increased with increasing degree of oxidation.

40|$|Thermal field-flow {{fractionation}} (ThFFF) is {{an analytical}} technique used to separate lipophilic polymers according {{to differences in}} their molecular weight or chemical composition. When Giddings conceptualized FFF,[1] he was searching for a separation technique that could be more precisely modeled than the chromatographic techniques that were used at the time. His success in this regard forms the basis {{for one of the}} great strengths of FFF, which is its ability to directly calculate physicochemical parameters of analytes from their residence times in the separation channel. ThFFF, which is one of several FFF subtechniques, separates polymers by magnifying their differential response to a temperature gradient. The physicochemical parameter that quantifies the movement of polymers in a temperature gradient is the Soret coefficient (S), and can be calculated directly from a polymer’s residence time in the ThFFF channel. From S, the molecular weight of the polymer can be calculated, provided the system is first calibrated using a well-characterized polymer standard of the same composition and the intrinsic viscosity of the component is known. Thus, from a single calibration run and a <b>viscosity</b> <b>detector,</b> ThFFF can be used to separate and characterize the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of polymer samples...|$|E
40|$|Determination of {{the size}} {{distributions}} of natural polysaccharides is a challenging task. More advantageous for characterization are well-defined synthetic (hyper) -branched polymers. In this study we concentrated on synthetic amylopectin analogues {{in order to obtain}} and compare all available data for different distributions and size dependence of molecular weights. Two groups of well-defined synthetic branched polysaccharides were synthesized via an in vitro enzyme-catalyzed reaction using the enzyme phosphorylase b from rabbit muscle and Deinococcus geothermalis glycogen branching enzyme. Synthetic polymers had a tunable degree of branching (2 %− 13 % determined via 1 H NMR) and a tunable degree of polymerization (30 − 350 determined indirectly via UV spectrometry). The systems used for separation and characterization of branched polysaccharides were SEC-DMSO/LiBr and multi detection (refractive index detector, <b>viscosity</b> <b>detector,</b> and multi angle light scattering detector) and SEC-water/ 0. 02 % NaN 3; and SEC- 50 mM NaNO 3 / 0. 02 % NaN 3 and multi detection. Additionally the side chain length distribution of enzymatically debranched polysaccharides was investigated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis. With this combination of characterization techniques, we were able not only to characterize the amylopectin analogues but also to solve parts of the molecular mechanism of their enzymatic polymerization. Moreover our materials showed potential to be standards in the field of natural polysaccharides characterization. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of on-chip analytical separations using planar hydrodynamic chromatography (HDC) in Pyrex-silicon and fused silica chips has been demonstrated. In order to sketch the analytical separations {{area in which}} the HDC chip has to operate, an introduction was given of important macro-scale separation techniques and their microfabricated counterparts. Furthermore, an impression of separation techniques that are enabled specifically by microtechnology was presented. One of these techniques is on-chip planar hydrodynamic chromatography. Other techniques are mainly aimed at DNA analysis using differences in transport of DNA through various constraining (microfabricated) geometries. Two types of HDC chips have been fabricated. The first type employs a Pyrex top wafer and a silicon bottom wafer, while the second type is fabricated using fused silica for both top and bottom wafers. Separation and injection channels were defined in the bottom wafer, whereas the top wafer provided through-holes for external connections. One particular part of the fabrication technology, fusion bonding of Pyrex to silicon and of fused silica to fused silica, was thoroughly investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Bonding of Pyrex to silicon induces thermal stresses, which cause a slight deformation of the channel geometry. This deforms the sample zones thus decreasing the device performance. The thermal deformation was reduced by using fused silica. This has the additional advantage of a good transparency down to the deep-UV. Fabrication of the fused silica HDC chip required additional processing development, especially aimed at Reactive Ion Etching of deeper structures. The HDC chip designs were made using a combination of computational fluid dynamics and analytical expressions. Investigation of the chromatographic and technological constraints lead to a first Pyrex-silicon HDC chip design, incorporating a 1 μm deep and 0. 5 or 1 mm wide separation channel and a deeper (20 μm) integrated injection configuration. Apart from an enhanced injection structure, the fused silica HDC chip also incorporated an optical detection cell, located directly after the separation channel. This detection cell had roughly the same cross-sectional area as the separation channel, but was 30 μm deep, thereby giving a 30 -fold increase in the path length for external optical detection. All characterization steps were performed optically. For the Pyrex-silicon chip fluorescence imaging directly inside the 1 μm deep separation channel was used. The correct operation of the injection structure for the Pyrex-silicon and fused silica chips was demonstrated by visualization of the concentration distribution of a fluorescent dye. Subsequently, the separation capabilities in both chip types were demonstrated by separation of various polystyrene nanoparticles. In the fused silica chip detection of the particles was performed using UV absorption detection through the integrated optical detection cell. In the Pyrex-silicon chip separation of large biomolecules was shown as well. Additionally, it was shown that relatively small molecules could be separated, not by using the hydrodynamic separation effect, but by interaction with the relatively large channel wall surface area (adsorption chromatography). The retention data for the particle separations showed that the influence of electrostatic and hydrodynamic particle-wall interactions on the particle retention behavior is not yet well understood and needs further research. The particle separations, detected using UV absorption through the detection cell, enabled a quantitative estimate of the peak broadening. Plate numbers ranging from 10. 000 for small analytes to more than 100. 000 for large fluorescent and non-fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles were obtained. Qualitative comparison of (fluorescent) zone shapes showed that thermal deformation of the Pyrex-silicon separation channel, resulting in a higher dispersion, is less pronounced in narrower channels. Narrower channels however exhibit a relatively large influence of the side-walls on the total peak broadening, which leads to smaller plate numbers. Improvement of the separation resolution must therefore be aimed at reduction of the side-wall induced dispersion and of the thermal deformation. This could be realized by using wider channels, defined in fused silica. For integration with the Pyrex-silicon HDC chip a prototype stand-alone <b>viscosity</b> <b>detector</b> was developed using a technologically compatible fabrication process. The functionality of the differential detector was demonstrated by measuring the viscosity change caused by an ethanol plug in deionized water. A viscosity sensing resolution of Δηsp = 3 * 10 - 3 was estimated from those measurements. For the HDC chip a resolution of 10 - 4 is required. The difference {{can be explained by the}} extremely low volume flows and sample volumes required in on-chip HDC. Upscaling of the <b>viscosity</b> <b>detector</b> for higher volume flows theoretically improves the detection limits. Upscaling could thus create a functional <b>viscosity</b> <b>detector</b> with sample volumes that are much smaller than required for commercial viscodetectors. This could enable application of the detector for miniaturized (not necessarily micromachined) liquid chromatography systems for polymer analysis...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in polyolefin manufacture {{have focused on}} the production of differentiated commodity polyolefins, specialty polyolefins, and polyolefins hybrids. What differentiates these new polyolefin types from commodity polyolefins is that their molecular architectures are much more complex and often contain long chain branches (LCBs), leading to unique properties that make them competitive with specialty polymers. One approach to produce these novel polyolefins is to use one or two single-site catalysts in two CSTRs in series. The first CSTR is used to make semicrystalline polymer chains, some of which must be vinyl-terminated (macromonomers). These macromonomers are then incorporated, via terminal branching, onto the chains growing in the second CSTR, becoming LCBs. If the backbone and the macromonomer have different compositions, they are called cross-products. Since {{it is not possible to}} incorporate all macromonomers, the final polymer will consist of a complex mixture of linear chains made by the two catalysts, homogeneous-branched chains (that is, chains where the backbone and all LCBs are of the same type), and cross-product macromolecules. The cross-product will add rather special properties to the polymer and, depending on its molecular architecture, the final product may act as a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). Developing polymer reactor models for different catalyst combinations can help understand the details of these complex syntheses and to control the properties and fractions of linear chains, homogeneous-branched chains, and cross-products. Two mathematical models were developed in this thesis for the solution polymerization of olefins with two single-site catalysts to predict the microstructure of long chain branched polyolefins. The first model was developed for a semi-batch reactor and the second one for two CSTRs in series. The models can predict the fractions of different polymer populations made in CSTRs and semibatch reactors, as well as their average chain lengths and LCB densities. Simulation results show that CSTRs are more efficient than semi-batch reactors to make polymers with high LCB densities and/or cross product fraction. Simulation results also show that to increase the weight percent of cross-product using a linear-catalyst and a LCB-catalyst, the rate of macromonomer formation of the linear-catalyst should be high. The fraction of cross-product can be increased even further when both catalysts are capable of incorporating macromonomers to form LCB-chains because; in this case, both catalysts can form cross-product chains. Monomer concentration has no effect on cross-product mass fraction and polydispersity index, but increasing monomer concentration will decrease LCB density and increase the average chain lengths. Catalyst deactivation also has a great impact on polymer properties: LCB density, polydispersity index, cross-product fraction, and average chain lengths will all decrease by increasing the catalyst deactivation rate of both catalysts. Simulation results for two CSTRs in series shows that increasing residence time in the second CSTR will lead to higher cross-product formation and LCB density. This rate of increase is more significant if the residence time in the second CSTR is similar to that of the first CSTR. The catalyst feed policy also has a great impact on polymer properties. We found out that feeding the linear-catalyst and the LCB-catalyst in equal amounts to the first CSTR and just adding the LCB-catalyst to the second CSTR is the preferred catalyst injection method for making polymer with a high mass fraction of cross-product, high chain length averages, and lower polydispersity index (PDI). These simulation studies indicate that detailed polymerization kinetics for each catalyst is needed in order to synthesize these novel polyolefins. In the experimental part of this thesis, ethylene polymerization kinetics studies were performed first with two individual metallocene catalysts, then with both of them simultaneously. First, ethylene polymerization with rac-Et(Ind) 2 ZrCl 2 /MAO was carried out in a semi-batch solution reactor. Reaction temperature, monomer, MAO, and catalyst concentrations were the factors studied to establish a framework to predict catalyst decay, polymer yield and molecular weight averages. The polymerization order with respect to ethylene and catalyst concentration was found to be first order. Chain transfer to monomer was the dominating chain transfer reaction while β-hydride elimination was negligible. An increase in MAO concentration led to a decrease in molecular weight. Catalyst decay could be described with a first order mechanism. At low MAO concentration this catalyst could make polymer with about one vinyl group per chain. A similar ethylene polymerization kinetics study using dimethylsilyl(N-tert-butylamido) -(tetramethylcyclopentadienyl) -titanium dichloride (CGC-Ti) /MAO system showed that the polymerization order with respect to catalyst concentration was first order, but first order catalyst decay failed to explain catalyst deactivation. The polymerization order with respect to ethylene concentration was not unity for the whole range of ethylene concentration. The trigger mechanism, along with reversible first order activation and deactivation with MAO and first order thermal decay, could explain the effect of time, monomer and catalyst concentration on the rate of polymerization. Decrease in MAO concentration increased the amount of polymer chains with terminal vinyl groups and consequently led to polymers with LCBs. Decreasing monomer concentration at low MAO concentration also led to production of polymer chain with more long chain branching. Ethylene homopolymerization and copolymerization with 1 -octene were conducted using combined catalysts system at low and high MAO concentrations. Reactivity ratios were calculated and polymer samples with bimodal MWDs were obtained but no increase in LCB frequency or cross product formation was detected using carbon- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13 C NMR) and high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) coupled with a <b>viscosity</b> <b>detector.</b> In order to promote the formation of cross-product macromolecules, 1, 9 -decadiene was copolymerized with ethylene using the Et(Ind) 2 ZrCl 2 /MAO to make tailored macromonomers with pendant 1 -octenyl branches. The macromonomers ranged from having 1 to 6. 5 vinyl groups per chain. These macromonomers were then incorporated into growing ethylene/ 1 -butene or ethylene/ 1 -octene copolymer chains using a titanium-based constrained geometry catalyst (CGC-Ti) to form branch block polymer chains with amorphous main backbone having short chain branch density (SCBD) up to 50 per 1 000 carbon atoms, and high crystalinity long chain branches with SCBD up to 3 / 1000 C atoms (cross product). Increase in polymerization time or catalyst concentration in the second stage of polymerization was observed to increase the cross-product weight fraction. We also observed that an increase in ethylene pressure during the second stage of polymerization, while 1 -butene concentration was constant, favoured the formation of cross product. When 1 -octene was used as comonomer in the second stage of polymerization, the presence of more pendant vinyl groups in the macromonomer led to increased long chain branching...|$|E
