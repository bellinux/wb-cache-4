5|$|McCain was a {{co-sponsor}} of the Agent Orange Act of 1991, {{which enabled}} disability benefits for <b>Vietnam</b> <b>veterans</b> afflicted with Agent Orange-related diseases and established periodic scientific reviews {{to determine what}} levels of exposure and diseases would be covered.|$|E
50|$|The biker gang {{is led by}} Link (William Smith), a <b>Vietnam</b> <b>veteran</b> and {{the brother}} of an Army Major (Dan Kemp) who has {{recruited}} them. His gang consists of Duke (Adam Roarke) also a <b>Vietnam</b> <b>veteran,</b> Limpy (Paul Koslo), Speed (Eugene Cornelius), and another <b>Vietnam</b> <b>veteran</b> Dirty Denny (Houston Savage {{who was killed in}} a road accident not long after completing the film). They are under the orders of Army Captain Jackson (Bernie Hamilton).|$|R

5|$|In the US in the 1960s, {{military}} clothing {{became increasingly}} common (mostly olive drab rather than patterned camouflage); {{it was often}} found worn by anti-war protestors, initially within groups such as <b>Vietnam</b> <b>Veterans</b> Against the War but then increasingly widely {{as a symbol of}} political protest.|$|E
5|$|The bridge, {{along with}} the <b>Vietnam</b> <b>Veterans</b> Memorial Bridge and the Wheeling Suspension bridge were all closed in January 2005, {{stopping}} any traffic from Ohio or Wheeling Island from entering mainland West Virginia for an hour due to barges breaking loose during heavy flooding along the Ohio River.|$|E

5|$|There are {{fundamental}} {{problems at the}} Veterans Health Administration of staffing being inadequate for aging <b>Vietnam</b> <b>veterans</b> and for more recent veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan who may have complex health challenges such as traumatic brain injury, multiple limb amputations and prosthetics, diabetes and post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E
5|$|While in Vietnam, the {{veterans}} were {{told not to}} worry, and were persuaded the chemical was harmless. After returning home, <b>Vietnam</b> <b>veterans</b> began to suspect their ill health or the instances of their wives having miscarriages or children born with birth defects {{might be related to}} Agent Orange and the other toxic herbicides to which they had been exposed in <b>Vietnam.</b> <b>Veterans</b> began to file claims in 1977 to the Department of Veterans Affairs for disability payments for health care for conditions they believed were associated with exposure to Agent Orange, or more specifically, dioxin, but their claims were denied unless they could prove the condition began when they were in the service or within one year of their discharge.|$|E
5|$|Disgruntled by the {{treatment}} of <b>Vietnam</b> <b>veterans</b> in the United States after the war, Schwarzkopf considered leaving the military, but ultimately decided to stay, hoping to fix {{some of the problems}} encountered by the military during the war. He underwent surgery at Walter Reed Army Hospital shortly after his return from Vietnam to repair longstanding back problems exacerbated by parachute jumps.|$|E

5|$|Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after viewing an installment of the news series 60 Minutes that dealt with American secret agents the CIA left behind during the Vietnam War. The eventual concept that the assassin could create blind spots came after the writer spoke with his ophthalmologist brother. The entry featured a finished replica of the <b>Vietnam</b> <b>Veterans</b> Memorial, and various Canadian locales substituted for various locations in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Buildings {{to which}} Finnish American {{architect}} Eero Saarinen has contributed have received six awards, tied with the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Louis I. Kahn has been honored five times. Buildings by Frank Lloyd Wright have received this award four times, and both Ludwig Mies van der Rohe {{as well as}} the firm Pei Cobb Freed & Partners have each had three of their buildings honored. Of the 48 projects that have received this award, only two, Eames House and the <b>Vietnam</b> <b>Veterans</b> Memorial, had women as contributing architects.|$|E
5|$|During Pointman I, {{commission}} researchers devised ways {{to determine}} small dioxin levels in blood. Prior to this, such levels {{could only be}} found in the adipose (fat) tissue. The project studied dioxin (TCDD) levels in blood as well as in adipose tissue in a small group of <b>Vietnam</b> <b>veterans</b> who had been exposed to Agent Orange and compared them to those of a matched control group; the levels were found to be higher in the former group.|$|E

5|$|His {{confrontations}} with conservatives cost him several leadership {{positions in the}} Senate, including chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee. Despite isolation from his conservative colleagues, Mathias played an influential role in fostering African American civil rights, ending the Vietnam War, preserving the Chesapeake Bay, and constructing the <b>Vietnam</b> <b>Veterans</b> Memorial. He retired from the Senate in 1987, having served in Congress for twenty-six years (eight years in the U.S. House of Representatives and eighteen years in the U.S. Senate).|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{joined the}} Business Executives Move for Vietnam Peace. By 1971, Shoup {{publicly}} endorsed the anti-war veteran group <b>Vietnam</b> <b>Veterans</b> Against the War. As Vietnamization had reduced {{the visibility of}} the anti-war movement, and Shoup's criticism was not as prominent in the public arena. Fulbright and other senators urged the White House {{to listen to his}} criticisms, but Shoup's broader critique of American society and militarism was seen as more extreme than other officers who had simply criticized the strategy of the war.|$|E
5|$|The Fort Henry Bridge, the <b>Vietnam</b> <b>Veterans</b> Memorial Bridge (which carries I-470), and the Wheeling Suspension Bridge {{were all}} closed in January 2005, {{stopping}} any traffic from Ohio or Wheeling Island from entering mainland West Virginia {{for a few}} days because barges broke loose during heavy flooding along the Ohio River. The Wheeling Tunnel was closed for reconstruction work in 2007, 2008, and 2010, causing motorists who wished to travel through on I-70 to detour. The two detour routes were city streets in downtown Wheeling and the I-470 loop.|$|E

50|$|The Veterans Fast for Life was a water-only {{fast that}} lasted from September 1 to October 17, 1986 {{on the steps}} of the United States Capitol, Washington, D.C., as a protest against the U.S. {{policies}} in Central America (see Contra wars). Charles Liteky, former Army Chaplain, <b>Vietnam</b> <b>veteran</b> and recipient of the Medal of Honor, George Mizo, <b>Vietnam</b> <b>veteran,</b> Duncan Murphy, World War II veteran, and S. Brian Willson, <b>Vietnam</b> <b>veteran,</b> participated in the fast. Before embarking on the fast, Charles Liteky renounced in July 1986 his Medal of Honor in protest against the U.S. policies in Central America.|$|R
5|$|The National Mall is a large, open park in {{downtown}} Washington between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol. Given its prominence, the mall {{is often the}} location of political protests, concerts, festivals, and presidential inaugurations. The Washington Monument and the Jefferson Pier are {{near the center of}} the mall, south of the White House. Also on the mall are the National World War II Memorial at the east end of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, and the <b>Vietnam</b> <b>Veterans</b> Memorial.|$|E
5|$|The Twenty-five Year Award can {{be awarded}} to {{any type of}} {{architectural}} project and may be either a single structure {{or a group of}} structures that compose a larger whole. Past examples of projects winning the award in this way include both monuments, such as the Gateway Arch and <b>Vietnam</b> <b>Veterans</b> Memorial, and groupings of buildings, such as the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and Haystack Mountain School of Crafts. Most buildings nominated for this award are new structures but one winner, Faneuil Hall Marketplace, was a substantial renovation of warehouses into a festival marketplace.|$|E
5|$|The West Virginia portion {{was under}} {{construction}} by 1976, {{and work in}} both states was completed by 1983. The three-level diamond interchange on the eastern banks of the Ohio River {{was said to be}} the most complex interchange in West Virginia at the time of construction by the WVDOH spokesman Gary Chernenko. The opening of the <b>Vietnam</b> <b>Veterans</b> Memorial Bridge, along with another bridge in nearby Moundsville was thought to have reduced the amount of traffic, and thus tolls collected by the nearby Bellaire Bridge by up to 50 per cent in 1987.|$|E
