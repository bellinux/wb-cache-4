Accordingly, we derive nonlinear transversely isotropic models for the elastic response, stress relaxation, residual strain and creep of residual strain in order to model accurately the inelastic features associated with cyclic stress softening.

And, what is the strength of this bond that introduces the rubber-filler interaction? With the passion to know further, this project was carried out to address those two issues. Coupling agent, bis[3 -triethoxysilylpropyl-Jtetrasulfide abbreviated as TESPT, was added into the natural rubber compound with a view to enhance the rubber-silica interaction as a consequence of the poor interaction between silica and natural rubber chains due to different polarity between natural rubber and silica.
