40|$|<b>Vocational</b> {{rehabilitation}} or <b>integration</b> is {{a growing}} concern for people with psychiatric disabilities and mental health professionals. One of the key steps towards successful vocational outcome is to be competent in job interview skills, to form a favourable impression on job interviewers and to ultimately lead to a positive hiring decision. People with psychiatric disabilities have difficulties in managing job interviews effectively due to various reasons. This paper reviews seven studies on the effectiveness of job interview skills training for the sample of people with psychiatric disabilities. In view of some of the concerns identified in those previous studies, and in recent work rehabilitation literature, it is proposed that the job interview skills training should address the following issues: manifested adjustment, ability to communicate, concept of self-efficacy, skills generalisation, <b>vocational</b> rehabilitation versus <b>integration</b> and social validity of training materials. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} used a {{qualitative}} research design to unfold those contextual factors which influence vocational outcomes amongst people with bipolar disorder (BD). The {{data for this}} qualitative study was collated using a grounded theory approach because of its particular relevance to the study's aims i. e., to propose a theory grounded in the data that provided {{an account of the}} <b>vocational</b> <b>integration</b> process people with BD go through. The emerging theory consists of two over-arching principles that determine an individual's readiness to join the workforce: i) recovery from an acute phase of BD and ii) goodness of fit between the individual, support, job and wider contextual components. The emerging theory is in general agreement with those issues discussed in the literature. The present study also highlights the importance of maintaining a sense of hope and how self-determination may help individuals achieve their vocational goals.

40|$|Project (M. S., Counseling (Vocational Rehabilitation)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. Once {{stabilized}} {{in permanent}} supportive housing (PSH) formerly homeless {{individuals with disabilities}} can benefit from increased access and utilization of employment and vocational rehabilitation services. By establishing links with programs and integrating employment into the service delivery model, individuals seeking work will have greater access to resources to meet vocational goals. Additionally, local and state resources could be used more effectively for PSH tenants with disabilities. This integrated approach to housing and employment services leads to improvements to employment outcomes for persons with disabilities. This approach can be replicated effectively with existing resources in Sacramento. Source of Data: Data for this Project was collected using professional journals, library resources, EBSCO host, ERIC Data bases, internet resources, and interviews. The data was extracted {{from all of the}} following resources: peer-reviewed journal articles; textbooks; and materials from relevant agency websites, manuals, workbooks and toolkits provided by agencies that provide housing, employment and vocational rehabilitation services to low- income persons with disabilities. Conclusions Reached: A grant was prepared to fund a full-time program coordinator and a part-time job developer to staff the Vocational Opportunities Housing Collaborative (VOHC) - a program for <b>vocational</b> service <b>integration</b> - to establish a long-term, sustainable supportive housing and employment services model.

40|$|It {{might seem}} incongruous {{to bring forward}} {{the issue of the}} {{vocational}} reintegration of the homeless in a time deeply marked by fragmented career histories and beset by looming widespread unemployment. But this issue will loose none of its urgent topicality as long as work continues to be a key factors in shaping life, conferring social participation and social prestige, recognition and self-respect - or for as long as employment, career and the family retain their power as vital constituents of identity whose loss can precipitate or exacerbate a descent into homelessness. Against this backdrop, one of the central concerns of the present study is to investigate and evaluate the framework conditions for reintegration projects whose holistic approach has been extended to take in the area of "work" alongside other key life-areas such as "housing", "health" and "leisure". This also involves elucidating those conditions which inhibit institutions caring for the homeless from offering vocational opportunities, and thus from acting as socialisation instances along the path of long-term destitution. A multiple-perspective approach has been adopted based on: 1) an historical-theoretical analysis of institutions caring for the homeless; 2) a quantitative survey of 760 homeless persons and persons facing homelessness, assessing their aptitude for <b>vocational</b> (re-) <b>integration</b> in terms of motivation, professional qualification, health, and psycho-social outlook; 3) a qualitative expert survey for the reconstruction of action-weighted orientation in key actors in the provision of care for the homeless, and; 4) comparative case studies of six Berlin vocational employment projects in the homeless sector. As the results of the quantitative survey show, loss of employment remains one of the key triggers of homelessness. Furthermore, the longer the period of unemployment continues, the greater is its negative impact on the homeless person in terms of worsening motivation, health, and psycho-social outlook. Thus vocational and professional qualification projects play a preventive role in pre-empting even greater deprivation during the term of homelessness. From an historical perspective, however, it is apparent that vocational measures based on coercion and discipline have an markedly adverse effect on homeless peoples' attempts to re-enter the world of work. Constructive coping strategies that actively promote attempts to leave homelessness behind can only be put in place in projects based on such key principles as direct involvement of the homeless, voluntary, non-coercive participation, self-organisation, personal responsibility for daily organisation, integrated social and vocational qualification programmes, empowerment, and the physical separation of living quarters and work. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the knowledge and}} beliefs that teachers have about teaching with technology in a regional vocational education and training (VET) institute in Australia. Vocational teachers must demonstrate teaching expertise (pedagogical knowledge) as well as industry expertise (content knowledge) to work with diverse learners in different contexts. Recent surveys have revealed that teachers’ use of technology within the VET sector is not effectively incorporated nor has it been embraced in pedagogically defensible ways. Thus {{there is a need}} for teachers to embrace ‘technology’ knowledge commensurate with industry and workplaces and to integrate it more effectively into their pedagogy. Through the lens of the TPACK (technological pedagogical content knowledge) framework, this study examined teachers’ beliefs about the nature of knowledge (epistemology) and beliefs about effective ways of teaching and learning (pedagogy). Using a mixed-methods approach, this research sought to understand how VET teachers’ knowledge and beliefs influenced their technology integration practices. The study found that teachers’ beliefs had a significant impact upon their use of technology. In particular, their epistemological beliefs were reflected in their perceptions of students and thus shaped their decisions about integrating technology into their teaching. These findings concluded that teacher beliefs about the nature of knowledge and its influence on teaching should be further studied since these core beliefs acted as a springboard from which to understand <b>vocational</b> teachers’ technology <b>integration</b> practices. Finally, this thesis illuminated the need for teacher education and professional development programs to focus on developing teachers’ knowledge by examining their beliefs across the technological, pedagogical and content domains...|$|R

Materials and methodsWe included patients with aphasia following a stroke before January 2004 from the Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation department of Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital and from patient associations. Initial clinical and demographic data were collected retrospectively. The severity of aphasia was assessed by the Aphasia Severity Rating Scale (ASRS) and communication skills in daily life by a French communication scale (Échelle de Communication Verbale de Bordeaux). Results 20 patients have been included, mean age 44 years; acute phase aphasia was always severe.

40|$|Abstract Background Individuals who sustain {{traumatic}} brain injuries (TBIs) often continue to experience significant impairment of cognitive functions {{mediated by the}} prefrontal cortex well into chronic stages of recovery. Traditional brain training programs that focus on improving specific skills fall short of addressing integrative functions that draw upon multiple higher-order processes critical for social and <b>vocational</b> <b>integration.</b> In the current study, we compare the effects of two short-term, intensive, group-based cognitive rehabilitation programs for individuals with chronic TBI. One program emphasizes learning about brain functions and influences on cognition, while the other program adopts a top-down approach to improve abstract reasoning abilities that are largely reliant on the prefrontal cortex. These treatment programs are evaluated in civilian and military veteran TBI populations. Methods/design One hundred individuals are being enrolled in this double-blinded clinical trial (all measures and data analyses will be conducted by blinded raters and analysts). Each individual is {{randomly assigned to one}} of two treatment conditions, with each condition run in groups of five to seven individuals. The primary anticipated outcomes are improvement in abstract reasoning and everyday life functioning, measured through behavioral tasks and questionnaires, and attention modulation, as measured by functional neuroimaging. Secondary expected outcomes include improvements in the cognitive processes of working memory, attention, and inhibitory control. Discussion Results of this trial will determine whether cognitive rehabilitation aimed at teaching TBI-relevant information about the brain and cognition versus training in TBI-affected thinking abilities (e. g., memory, attention, and executive functioning) can improve outcomes in chronic military and civilian TBI patient populations. It should shed light on the nature of improvements and the characteristics of patients most likely to benefit. This trial will also provide information about the sustainability of treatment-related improvements 3 months post-training. Trial registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT 01552473 </p...|$|E
40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the development and the application of psycho-diagnostic test procedures for the vocational aptitude of the Deaf. The gained data serve as basis for a comparison of the average mathematical competences of deaf and hearing people. Additionally, the data are used to form and test hypotheses about possible reasons for the differences in achievement which have been found. The fact that the procedure of the vocational diagnostics differs in parts between hearing and deaf people can be explained due to the particular situation of the Deaf and their linguistic and cultural uniqueness. In order to clarify this, the “Aachen Test Battery of Vocational Aptitude of the Deaf (ATBG) ” which is based on the idea of culture fair diagnostics – meaning a diagnostics of the vocational aptitude based on sign language – is briefly described. Finally the composition of the test battery and the 23 individual test procedures will be presented briefly. The data which have been collected from hearing impaired people through the ATBG at <b>Vocational</b> Training Centres, <b>Integration</b> Centres, and other institutions concerned with vocational training and advanced vocational training of hearing impaired people, as well as data gained through investigations by the ATBG-team members at schools and vocational schools for hearing impaired students (N= 907), serve as basis for the analysis of the present paper. In {{order to be able to}} use the data collected through the ATBG tests for the analysis of the mathematical competences of the Deaf, it has to be proved that the test battery validly captures the characteristics that have to be measured. The analyses concerning the validity of the tests show that the translation and the adaptation of already existing procedures respectively, as well as the redesign of single test procedures of the ATBG for the diagnostic application of the ATBG at hearing impaired subjects have been successful. The multitude of the analyses and the variety of approaches of the analysis respectively – correlation studies, factor analysis, and non-metrical multi-dimensional scaling procedures – confirm these findings. After I firstly presented the ATBG approach in context with the diagnostics of the vocational aptitude and sign language and secondly showed that this approach is appropriate to capture performance features and behaviour features of hearing impaired people objectively, reliably, and validly, I will thirdly compare average competences of deaf and hearing people. Such comparisons are possible as many ATBG-test procedures are merely modifications of existing test procedures which have been developed and standardized for hearing people. The comparison of the mathematical skills were combined with the following research questions: (1) Do hearing and deaf people show systematic differences in performance concerning their mathematical skills? (2) Is it possible to identify potential causes for the differences in performance that have been found by means of a combination between the results of other studies and the analysis of the ATBG-data? In order to analyse the connection between mathematical skills and level of ability, I will contrast the results of international studies with hearing and deaf people with the data gained through the German ATBG-sample in the ability test procedures. The development of mathematical competences will be displayed with the help of various test procedures from the ATBG-test battery and the analysis of the influences of variables specific to the deaf (degree of hearing impairment, hearing status of the parents). Finally the influence of selected factors concerning special conditions of socialization of the Deaf will be evaluated by means of the analysis of the results from the ATBG-sample comprising linguistic and hearing-impaired-pedagogical aspects. Even though the results of the present study show very low mathematical skills in German deaf people compared to hearing people the study also identifies ways, in which this difference in performance can be reduced in the future. Low mathematical skills can neither be put down to ‘Deafness per se’ nor can they be determined by the intellectual ability level of the Deaf. The analyses indicate that bilingual education and schooling approaches, advancement of writing skills of the Deaf, the creation of surroundings which give deaf children and adolescents the possibility to make more experiences and improve their informal knowledge, as well as a mathematical-didactic approach which is adapted to the specific problems and abilities of the Deaf and thus supports their development of mathematical competences can improve the mathematical skills of the Deaf...|$|R

Effectiveness of {{supported}} employment for veterans with spinal cord injuries: {{results from a}} randomized multisite study. Objective: To examine whether {{supported employment}} (SE) {{is more effective than}} treatment as usual (TAU) in returning veterans to competitive employment after spinal cord injury (SCI). Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled, multisite trial of SE versus TAU for vocational issues with 12 months of follow-up data. Setting: SCI centers in the Veterans Health Administration. Participants: Subjects (N= 201) were enrolled and completed baseline interviews. In interventional sites, subjects were randomly assigned to the SE condition (n= 81) or the TAU condition (treatment as usual–interventional site [TAU-IS], n= 76). In observational sites where the SE program was not available, 44 subjects were enrolled in a nonrandomized TAU condition (treatment as usual– observational site [TAU-OS]). Interventions: The intervention consisted of an SE vocational rehabilitation program called the Spinal Cord Injury <b>Vocational</b> <b>Integration</b> Program, which adhered as closely as possible to principles of SE as developed and described in the individual placement and support model of SE for persons with mental illness. Main Outcome Measures: The primary study outcome measurement was competitive employment in the community. Results: Subjects in the SE group were 2. 5 times more likely than the TAU-IS group and 11. 4 times more likely than the TAU-OS group to obtain competitive employment. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and only controlled study of a specific vocational rehabilitation program to report improved employment outcomes for persons with SCI. SE, a well-prescribed method of integrated vocational care, was superior to usual practices in improving employment outcomes for veterans with SCI...|$|E
40|$|My {{bachelor}} work {{is about}} the mens knowledge {{about the problem of}} the urinary incontinence. Many people suffer from this urinary incontinence. Its especially the health problem of older people. But this incontinence is the diagnosis concerning both women and men, also children and this disease negatively influences their life. Its condition whereat a man cant alone regulate his urinaring. The urinary incontinence is jointed with considerable physical, psychic, social and economie stress. The incontinence patients often lose their self-respect, first-quality life and social- intercourse. They often give up their common life. The social structure, the relationship of husband and wife, the <b>vocational</b> <b>integration</b> and the satisfaction are injured. The urinary incontinence is the intimate problem and we cant or we dont want to speak about it. My work includes the classification, diagnostic, the cure of incontinence and the special incontinence instruments for men. It was taken up the quantitative research. The adopted method was the question-form. The collection of information took place in 3 ambulances of the general practitioners in the town České Budějovice. The men age of more than 30 years old were as the research team in this boron, who visited these chosen ambulances in the days of 17. 1. - 28. 2. 2007. The question-forms were given accidentally. This research should be certify or confute this hypothesis: the men havent information about the problem of the urinary incontinence. The hypothesis was certified. The project was fulfilled. Fact is that ware questioned men embraced ware information about the urinare incontinence and they also think, that the information about this problem is very insufficient. The both of abonents had never available the information materials the urinary incontinence. We must improve the quality of information and it will be better to produce and to distribute ware and ware brochures about this disease. Then the general public can read them in the waiting rooms, in the geriatrics ambulances. The nurses should supply the relevant information and to help people. I also believe, that my work will help for the general public, too...|$|E
