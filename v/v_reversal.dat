40|$|ABSTRACT In 2004, Malaysian Education Ministry (KPM) {{had begun}} its “Pilot Program of Dyslexia-Specific Learning Problems”, and {{currently}} in 2012 {{there are already}} 49 primary schools with 86 dyslexia classes throughout Malaysia. This study focuses on the detection of spelling errors in the Malay Language essay-writing done by dyslexic children all across Terengganu, Malaysia. This spelling error detection was centralized on the Levinson Theory, 1994. This theory has shown seven aspects of errors in the writing done by dyslexic children, namely errors in terms of (i) elimination, (ii) transfer, (iii) insertion, (iv) replacement, (<b>v)</b> <b>reversal,</b> (vi) wild guess, and (vii) condensation. This study was done on eight dyslexic children aged 10 years old registered with the Society Welfare Department, Terengganu {{and all of them}} were adopted as the sample of the study. The study find-ings have demonstrated that elimination, replacement and wild guess were among the most committed by the subjects. Meanwhile, in terms of transfer, reversal and condensation, they were the lowest committed by the subjects. The study outcome had given priority to the instructors of the dyslexic class, for them to make some improvements on the teaching and learning strategies in facilitating the process of mastering the spelling for the subject of study. The variety of therapies used to promote spelling mastery {{can be used as a}} consolidation in learning and to strengthen exercises both in school and outside class hours...|$|E

40|$|NanC is an Escherichia coli outer {{membrane}} protein involved in sialic acid (Neu 5 Ac, i. e., N-acetylneuraminic acid) uptake. Expression of the NanC gene is induced {{and controlled by}} Neu 5 Ac. The transport mechanism of Neu 5 Ac is not known. The structure of NanC was recently solved (PDB code: 2 WJQ) and includes a unique arrangement of positively charged (basic) side chains consistent with a role in acidic sugar transport. However, initial functional measurements of NanC failed to find {{its role in the}} transport of sialic acids, perhaps because of the ionic conditions used in the experiments. We show here that the ionic conditions generally preferred for measuring the function of outer-membrane porins are not appropriate for NanC. Single channels of NanC at pH  7. 0 have: (1) conductance 100  pS to 800  pS in 100  mM: KCl to 3  M: KCl), (2) anion over cation selectivity (<b>V</b> (<b>reversal)</b>  = + 16  mV in 250  mM: KCl || 1  M: KCl), and (3) two forms of voltage-dependent gating (channel closures above ± 200  mV). Single-channel conductance decreases by 50 % when HEPES concentration is increased from 100  ?M: to 100  mM: in 250  mM: KCl at pH  7. 4, consistent with the two HEPES binding sites observed in the crystal structure. Studying alternative buffers, we find that phosphate interferes with the channel conductance. Single-channel conductance decreases by 19 % when phosphate concentration is increased from 0  mM: to 5  mM: in 250  mM: KCl at pH  8. 0.

Pregnancy outcomes of robotic tubal reversal surgery patients were also compared to pregnancy outcome of abdominal incision tubal reversal patients. Approximately 65% of the robotic tubal reversal surgery patients became pregnant compared with 50% of the abdominal incision patients. Of the pregnancies, 6 abnormal pregnancies were in the robotic tubal reversal patients (4 ectopic and 2 miscarriage) and 2 were in the abdominal incision patients (1 ectopic and 1 miscarriage).

40|$|Food {{restriction}} {{has been}} reported to have positive effects on cognition. This study examines how another environmental factor, daylength, can alter the impact of food restriction on the brain and behavior. Female California mice (Peromyscus californicus), housed on either long days (16 h of light and 8 h of darkness) or short days (8 h of light and 16 h of darkness), were restricted to 80 % of their normal baseline food intake or provided with food ad libitum. Testing in a Barnes maze revealed that the effects of food restriction depended on photoperiod, and that these effects differed for acquisition <b>vs.</b> <b>reversal</b> learning. During acquisition testing, food restriction increased latency to finding the target hole in short-day mice but not in long-day mice. In reversal testing, food restriction decreased latency to finding the target hole in long-day mice but not in short-day mice. Latency to finding the hole was positively and independently correlated with both errors and time spent freezing, suggesting that changes in both spatial learning and anxiety-like behavior contributed to performance. Short days increased hippocampal expression of the synaptic protein, synapsin I, which was reversed by food restriction. Short days also reduced plasma corticosterone levels, but diet had no effect. There was no effect of diet or photoperiod on hippocampal expression of the glial marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein. The present findings suggest that, in female California mice, the differential effects of food restriction on acquisition and reversal learning are photoperiod-dependent. These results justify further testing of the relationship between food restriction and hippocampal synapsin I in the context of spatial learning...|$|R

The third study tested those movement qualities in combination with movement shaping (approach vs. avoidance motor behavior) and the effects of those combinations on attitudes toward initially valence-free stimuli and affect. Results suggest that movement rhythms influence affect (studies 1 and 2), and attitudes (study 3), and moderate the impact of approach and avoidance motor behavior on attitudes (study 3).

40|$|Figner, Mackinlay, Wilkening, and Weber (2009) {{developed}} the Columbia Card Task (CCT) to measure risk-taking attitudes. This tool {{consists of two}} versions: in the COLD version the decision maker needs to state in advance how many cards (out of 32) they want to turn over (so called static risk taking), in the HOT version they have the possibility of turning over all 32 cards one-by-one until they decide to finish (dynamic risk taking). We argue that the HOT version confounds an individual’s willingness to accept risk with their beliefs in trend continuation <b>vs.</b> trend <b>reversal</b> in a prognostic task. In two experimental studies we show that people believing in trend continuation (momentum subjects) turn over more cards than those believing in trend reversal (contrarians) in the HOT version of the task.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to revisit Simpson's paradox using a statistical misspecification perspective. It is argued that the reversal of statistical associations is sometimes spurious, stemming from invalid probabilistic assumptions imposed on the data. The concept of statistical misspecification is used to formalize the vague term `spurious results' as `statistically untrustworthy' inference results. This perspective sheds new light on the paradox by distingusing between statistically trustworthy <b>vs.</b> untrustworthy association <b>reversals.</b> It turns out that in both cases there is nothing counterintuitive to explain or account for. This perspective is also used to revisit the causal `resolution' of the paradox in an attempt to delineate the modeling and inference issues raised by the statistical misspecification perspective.

40|$|Ions enter cells through pores in {{proteins}} that are holes in dielectrics. The energy {{of interaction between}} ion and charge induced on the dielectric is many kT, and so the dielectric properties of channel and pore are important. We describe ionic movement by (three-dimensional) Nemst-Planck equations (including flux and net charge). Potential is described by Poisson's equation in the pore and Laplace's equation in the channel wall, allowing induced but not permanent charge. Asymptotic expansions are constructed exploiting the long narrow shape of the pore and the relatively high dielectric constant of the pore's contents. The resulting one-dimensional equations can be integrated numerically; they can be analyzed when channels are short or long (compared with the Debye length). Traditional constant field equations are derived if the induced charge is small, e. g., if the channel is short or if the total concentration gradient is zero. A constant gradient of concentration is derived if the channel is long. Plots directly comparable to experiments are given of current <b>vs</b> voltage, <b>reversal</b> potential <b>vs.</b> concentration, and slope conductance vs. concentration. This dielectric theory can easily be tested: its parameters can be determined by traditional constant field measurements. The dielectric theory then predicts current-voltage relations quite different from constant field, usually more linear, when gradients of total concentration are imposed. Numerical analysis shows that the interaction of ion and channel can be described by a mean potential if, but only if, the induced charge is negligible, that is to say, the electric field is spatially constant...|$|R

We {{seek to understand}} the morphological properties and formation mechanisms of small-scale umbral brightenings (SSUBs; analogous to umbral micro-jets) and to understand whether links between these events and short dynamic fibrils, umbral flashes, and umbral dots can be established. An SST filtergram time-series sampling the Ca II H line and a CRISP full-Stokes 15 -point Ca II 8542 A line scan dataset were used. The average lifetime and lengths of 54 SSUBs identified in the sunspot umbra {{are found to be}} 44. 2 seconds (sigma= 20 seconds) and 0. 56 " (sigma= 0. 14 "). The spatial positioning and morphological evolution of these events was investigated finding no evidence of parabolic or ballistic profiles nor a preference for co-spatial formation with umbral flashes. The presence of Stokes <b>V</b> profile <b>reversals</b> provided evidence that these events could form through the development of shocks in the chromosphere. The application of the weak-field approximation indicated that changes in the line-of-sight magnetic field were not responsible for the modifications to the line profile and suggested that thermodynamic effects are the actual cause of the increased emission. Finally, a sub-set of SSUBs were observed to form at the foot-points of short dynamic fibrils. Overall, we found no correlation between the spatial locations where these events were observed and the occurrence of umbral dots and umbral flashes. SSUBs, however, have lifetimes and spectral signatures comparable to umbral flashes and are located at the footpoints of short dynamic fibrils, during or {{at the end of the}} red-shifted stage. It is possible, therefore, that these features form due to the shocking of fibrilar material in the lower atmosphere upon its return under gravity. Comment: 11 pages, 9 Figure...|$|R

The main objective of this study was to show that a previous electrokinetic treatment could reduce the PAH residual fractions when the soil is subsequently treated by means of a bioremediation process. The approach involved the electrokinetic treatment of PAHpolluted soils at a potential drop of 0. 9 to 1. 1 V/cm and the subsequent estimations of bioaccessibility of residual PAHs after slurry-phase biodegradation. Bioaccessibility of PAH in two creosote-polluted soils (clay and loamy sand, total PAH content averaging 300 mg/kg) previously treated with an electric field in the presence of nonionic surfactant Brij 35 was often higher than in untreated controls. For example, total PAH content remaining in clay soil after bioremediation was only 62. 65 ± 4. 26 mg/kg, whereas a 7 -d electrokinetic pretreatment had, under the same conditions, a residual concentration of 29. 24 ± 1. 88 mg/kg after bioremediation. Control treatments without surfactant indicated that the electrokinetic treatment increased bioaccessibility of PAHs. A different manner of electric field implementation (continuous current <b>vs.</b> current <b>reversals)</b> did not induce changes in PAH bioaccessibility. We suggest that this hybrid technology may be useful in certain bioremediation scenarios, such as soils rich in clay and black carbon, which show limited success due to bioavailability restrictions, as well as in highly heterogeneous soils.

40|$|Pulsed wave Doppler {{ultrasound}} {{recordings of}} blood flow velocity in the superior vena cava {{were made in}} 40 healthy adults (aged 22 to 69 years) during both normal respiration and 10 second episodes of apnea. The forward flow velocity pattern was biphasic, with systolic flow velocity greater than diastolic flow velocity. During apnea, peak flow velocities ranged from 32 to 69 cm/s (mean 45. 7 ± 8. 4) during systole and from 6 to 45 cm/s (mean 27. 2 ± 8. 3) in early diastole. Systolic flow velocity integrals also exceeded diastolic values. With atrial systole (A wave), forward flow velocities were reduced or flow was reversed. Thirty-nine of 40 subjects had A wave flow reversal during apnea, and in these the ratio of reverse to total forward flow velocity integrals ranged from 1 to 16 % (mean 6 ± 4 %). Compared with values during apnea, there were higher mean values with inspiration and lower values with expiration for velocities and flow velocity integrals. Hepatic vein tracings, when adequate (12 of 40 subjects), showed forward flow characteristics similar to those from the superior vena cava, but with more frequent and larger A wave and ventricular end-systole (atrial <b>V</b> wave) flow <b>reversals.</b> Superior vena cava flow velocity variables were calculated in subgroups to assess the effects of age, respiratory pattern and increased venous return. This study defines normal Doppler ultrasound superior vena cava and hepatic vein flow velocities and their variation with respiration in healthy adults.

40|$|Sunspot atmospheres {{have been}} shown to be highly inhomogeneous hosting both quasi-stable and {{transient}} features, such as small-scale umbral brightenings (previously named "umbral micro-jets") and dark fibril-like events. Aims. We seek to understand the morphological properties and formation mechanisms of small-scale umbral brightenings (analogous to umbral micro-jets). In addition, we aim to understand whether links between these events and short dynamic fibrils, umbral flashes, and umbral dots can be established. Methods. A Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope (SST) filtergram time-series sampling the Ca ii H line and a CRisp Imaging Spectro-Polarimeter (SST/CRISP) full-Stokes 15 -point Ca ii 8542 Å line scan dataset were used. The spatial resolutions of these datasets are close to 0. 1 ′′ and 0. 18 ′′ with cadences of 1. 4 s and 29 s, respectively. These data allowed us to construct light-curves, plot line profiles, and to perform a weak-field approximation in order to infer the magnetic field strength. Results. The average lifetime and lengths of the 54 small-scale brightenings identified in the sunspot umbra are found to be 44. 2 s (σ = 20 s) and 0. 56 ′′ (σ = 0. 14 ′′), respectively. The spatial positioning and morphological evolution of these events in Ca ii H filtergrams was investigated finding no evidence of parabolic or ballistic profiles nor a preference for co-spatial formation with umbral flashes. Line scans in Ca ii 8542 Å and the presence of Stokes <b>V</b> profile <b>reversals</b> provided evidence that these events could form in a similar manner to umbral flashes in the chromosphere (i. e. through the formation of shocks either due to the steepening of localised wavefronts or due to the impact of returning material from short dynamic fibrils, a scenario we find evidence for). The application of the weak-field approximation indicated that changes in the line-of-sight magnetic field were not responsible for the modifications to the line profile and suggested that thermodynamic effects are, in fact, the actual cause of the increased emission. Finally, a sub-set of small-scale brightenings were observed to form at the foot-points of short dynamic fibrils. Conclusions. The small-scale umbral brightenings studied here do not appear to be jet-like in nature. Instead they appear to be evidence of shock formation in the lower solar atmosphere. We found no correlation between the spatial locations where these events were observed and the occurrence of umbral dots and umbral flashes. These events have lifetimes and spectral signatures comparable to umbral flashes and are located at the footpoints of short dynamic fibrils, during or at the end of the red-shifted stage. It is possible that these features form due to the shocking of fibrilar material in the lower atmosphere upon its return under gravity...|$|R
40|$|While the {{development}} of microelectrode arrays has enabled access to disparate regions of a cortex for neurorehabilitation, neuroprosthetic and basic neuroscience research, accurate interpretation of the signals and manipulation of the cortical neurons depend upon the anatomical placement of the electrode arrays in a layered cortex. Toward this end, this report compares two in vivo methods for identifying the placement of electrodes in a linear array spaced 100 µm apart based on in situ laminar analysis of (1) ketamine–xylazine-induced field potential oscillations in a rat motor cortex and (2) an intracortical electrical stimulation-induced movement threshold. The first method is based on finding the polarity reversal in laminar oscillations which is reported to appear at the transition between layers IV and V in laminar 'high voltage spindles' of the rat cortical column. Analysis of histological images in our dataset indicates that polarity reversal is detected 150. 1 ± 104. 2 µm below the start of layer V. The second method compares the intracortical microstimulation currents that elicit a physical movement for anodic versus cathodic stimulation. It {{is based on the}} hypothesis that neural elements perpendicular to the electrode surface are preferentially excited by anodic stimulation while cathodic stimulation excites those with a direction component parallel to its surface. With this method, we expect to see a change in the stimulation currents that elicits a movement at the beginning of layer V when comparing anodic versus cathodic stimulation as the upper cortical layers contain neuronal structures that are primarily parallel to the cortical surface and lower layers contain structures that are primarily perpendicular. Using this method, there was a 78. 7 ± 68 µm offset in the estimate of the depth of the start of layer <b>V.</b> The polarity <b>reversal</b> method estimates the beginning of layer V within ± 90 µm with 95 % confidence and the intracortical stimulation method estimates it within ± 69. 3 µm. We propose that these methods can be used to estimate the in situ location of laminar electrodes implanted in the rat motor cortex...|$|R

The goal {{of this study was to}} compare the incidence of new ischemic cerebral lesions on diffusion-perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences after transcervical CAS performed with carotid flow <b>reversal</b> <b>vs</b> stenting via transfemoral approach with distal filter protection. MethodsDuring a 26 -month period, 64 consecutive patients diagnosed with significant carotid stenosis by ultrasound imaging were assigned to transcervical CAS with carotid flow reversal or a transfemoral approach with a distal filter. The Rankin stroke scale was administered by an independent neurologist, and diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) studies were performed ≤ 24 hours before and ≤ 24 to 48 hours after the procedure. DW-MRI studies were compared by two neuroradiologists not involved in the study and blinded for time, clinical status, and treatment option. Hyperintense DW-MRI signals found after the procedure were interpreted as postoperative ischemic infarcts. All patients were assessed at 1, 6, and 12 months after the intervention. ResultsThe distribution of demographic and pathologic variables was similar in both groups. All procedures were technically successful, with a mean carotid flow reversal time of 22 minutes. Twenty-one (70 %) and 23 patients (69. 69 %) were symptomatic in the transcervical and transfemoral groups, respectively (P =. 869). After intervention, new postprocedural DW-MRI ischemic infarcts were found in four transcervical (12. 9 %) and in 11 transfemoral (33. 3 %) patients (P =. 03), without new neurologic symptoms. No major adverse events occurred at 30 days after the intervention. All patients remained neurologically intact, without an increase in stroke scale scoring. All stents remained patent, and all patients remained stroke-free during follow-up. In multivariate analysis, age (relative risk [RR], 1. 022; P <. 001), symptomatic status (RR, 4. 109; P <. 001), and open-cell vs closed-cell stent design (RR, 2. 01; P <. 001) were associated with a higher risk of embolization in the transfemoral group but not in the transcervical group. ConclusionsThese data suggest that transcervical carotid stenting with carotid flow reversal carries a significantly lower incidence of new ischemic brain infarcts than that resulting from transfemoral CAS with a distal filter. The transcervical approach with carotid flow reversal may improve the safety of CAS and has the potential to improve results in especially vulnerable patients such as the elderly and symptomatic...|$|R
40|$|Several drugs {{utilized}} in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) rely on DNA damage for tumor killing. This study aimed at verifying whether {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs) of genes involved in DNA repair may contribute to prognostication of DLBCL treated with R-CHOP. The study utilized a training-validation design. The training cohort (n= 163) was a mono-institutional, prospectively collected, consecutive series of DLBCL homogeneously treated with the same chemotherapeutic regimen both at diagnosis (R-CHOP 21) and at relapse/progression (R-DHAP ± BEAM conditioned autologous stem cell transplant, ASCT). The validation cohort (n= 156) was a multi-institutional retrospective series of DLBCL treated with R-CHOP at diagnosis. Candidate SNPs (n= 35) were selected by an educated guess approach, and included SNPs belonging to genes involved in: i) mismatch repair (MLH 1); ii) base excision repair (XRCC 1, OGG 1); iii) nucleotide excision repair (ERCC 1, ERCC 2, ERCC 4, ERCC 5, ERCC 6, XPA, XPC); iv) double strand break repair (BRCA 1, BRCA 2, LIG 4, XRCC 2, XRCC 3, XRCC 4, XRCC 6); and <b>v)</b> direct <b>reversal</b> (MGMT). Clinical endpoints were progression free survival (PFS) after R-CHOP, overall survival (OS) from diagnosis, and OS from salvage treatment. Univariate analysis controlled for multiple comparisons identified MLH 1 rs 1799977 as the sole SNP predicting DLBCL OS in the training series (AG/GG genotype: HR: 3. 23; 4 -year OS: 55. 5 % vs AA genotype: 4 -year OS: 80. 9 %; p<. 001; q=. 009) (Fig. 1 A). Multivariate analysis identified the MLH 1 rs 1799977 AG/GG genotype (HR: 3. 14; p<. 001) as an independent predictor of OS, along with IPI score (HR: 1. 38; p=. 037) and bulky disease (HR: 2. 56; p=. 004). The prognostic relevance of MLH 1 rs 1799977 in the DLBCL training series {{was due to the}} impact on risk of failing both R-CHOP 21 (AG/GG genotype; HR: 2. 02; 4 -year PFS: 47. 5 %; AA genotype: 4 -year PFS: 65. 6 %; p=. 007) (Fig. 1 B) and second line treatment (AG/GG genotype: HR: 3. 04; 2 -year OS from salvage: 16. 0 %; AA genotype: 2 -year OS from salvage: 57. 3 %; p=. 007) (Fig. 1 C). Multivariate analysis identified the MLH 1 rs 1799977 AG/GG genotype (HR: 1. 96; p=. 010) as an independent predictor of PFS after R-CHOP 21, along with IPI score (HR: 1. 41; p=. 002) and bulky disease (HR: 1. 96; p=. 012). By bivariate analysis, MLH 1 predicted OS from salvage treatment independent of having (p=. 002) or having not (p=. 049) consolidated with ASCT. The DLBCL validation series did not differ from the training series in terms of clinical features at presentation, median follow-up (p=. 429), OS (p=. 331), PFS (p=. 416), OS from salvage (p=. 987), and prevalence of MLH 1 rs 1799977 genotypes (p=. 378). The MLH 1 rs 1799977 AG/GG genotype was confirmed as a predictor of poor outcome in the DLBCL validation series when considering all clinical endpoints, including: i) OS (unadjusted HR: 3. 22, p=. 001; adjusted HR: 3. 15; p=. 001); ii) PFS (unadjusted HR: 1. 98, p=. 017; adjusted HR: 1. 86, p=. 018); and iii) OS from salvage treatment (unadjusted HR: 2. 95, p=. 027). Pooling of the training and validation series (n= 319) revealed that MLH 1 AG/GG predicts DLBCL OS within subgroups defined by IPI. The biologic plausibility of the association between MLH 1 rs 1799977 genotype and DLBCL outcome is supported by four lines evidence: i) MLH 1 rs 1799977 is a nonsynonymous SNP causing the I 219 V amino acidic substitution in MLH 1, a gene of the mismatch repair pathway; ii) in silico, MLH 1 rs 1799977 is predicted to have deleterious consequences; iii) in vitro, the G variant allele of MLH 1 rs 1799977 associates with reduced MLH 1 protein expression; iv) loss of MLH 1 expression in tumor cells is known to induce refractoriness to doxorubicin and platinum compounds...|$|R
40|$|Background. Several drugs {{utilized}} in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treatment rely on DNA damage for tumor killing. Host genetic variability in genes repairing DNA damage may affect response {{to drugs and}} prognosis. Aims. We verified the impact of DNA repair genes SNPs on prognosis of R-CHOP treated DLBCL. Methods. The study was based on 163 consecutive DLBCL treated with R-CHOP and provided with a prospectively collected dataset. At diagnosis, age > 60 years was observed in 104 / 163 (63. 8 %) cases, ECOG PS > 1 in 21 / 163 (12. 9 %), extranodal sites > 1 in 41 / 163 (25. 2 %), Ann Arbor stage III-IV in 85 / 163 (52. 1 %), bulky in 46 / 163 (28. 2 %), LDH elevation in 75 / 163 (46. 0 %), IPI > 2 in 55 / 163 (33. 7 %). Median follow-up was 48 months. Thirty-five SNPs from 18 genes were analyzed on patients’ germline DNA. These included SNPs affecting: i) mismatch repair (MLH 1 rs 1799977 /rs 1800734); ii) base excision repair (XRCC 1 rs 1799782 /rs 25487, OGG 1 rs 1052133); iii) nucleotide excision repair (ERCC 1 rs 3212986, ERCC 2 rs 1052555 / rs 13181 /rs 1799793 / rs 238406, ERCC 4 rs 1800067 /rs 3136038, ERCC 5 rs 17655, ERCC 6 rs 2228528 /rs 2228529 /rs 3793784, XPArs 1800975, XPCrs 222799 / rs 2228000 /rs 2607775 /rs 2228001); iv) double strand break repair (BRCA 1 rs 49868507 rs 17999507 rs 799917, BRCA 2 rs 144848, LIG 4 rs 1805388, XRCC 2 rs 3218536, XRCC 3 rs 17997947 rs 861539, XRCC 4 rs 1805377, XRCC 6 rs 5751129 /rs 132788); and <b>v)</b> direct <b>reversal</b> (MGMTrs 16906252 /rs 2308321 /rs 12917). Clinical endpoints were overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS). Informed consent was obtained. Results. Univariate analysis controlled for multiple comparisons identified MLH 1 rs 1799977 as the sole DNA repair SNP predicting OS in R-CHOP treated DLBCL. Patients carrying the MLH 1 rs 1799977 AG/GG genotype displayed {{an increased risk of}} death (HR: 3. 23; 4 -years OS: 55. 5 %) compared to AA carriers (4 -years OS: 80. 9 %) (P=. 0002; q=. 009; Fig. 1 A). Multivariate analysis selected MLH 1 rs 1799977 (HR: 3. 14; P=. 0004) as an independent predictor of OS, along with IPI (HR: 1. 38; P=. 0377) and bulky disease (HR: 2. 56; P=. 0044). Accordingly, when combined to IPI, MLH 1 rs 1799977 refined the clinical prognostication of DLBCL. The poor prognosis heralded by MLH 1 rs 1799977 AG/GG genotype in DLBCL is due to first and second line treatment failure. Patients carrying the MLH 1 rs 1799977 AG/GG genotype displayed an increased risk of failing R-CHOP (HR: 1. 66; 4 -years EFS: 48. 3 %) compared to AA carriers (4 -years EFS: 62. 2 %) (P=. 0399; Fig. 1 B). Multivariate analysis identified MLH 1 rs 1799977 (HR: 1. 66; P=. 0498) as an independent predictor of EFS, along with IPI (HR: 1. 61; P<. 0001) and bulky disease (HR: 1. 84; P=. 0215). Also, patients carrying the MLH 1 rs 1799977 AG/GG genotype displayed an increased risk of failing second line platinum-based regimens (HR: 3. 04; 4 -year OS from salvage: 16. 0 %) compared to AA carriers (4 -year OS from salvage: 57. 3 %) (P=. 0050; Figure 1 C). By bivariate analysis, MLH 1 rs 1799977 predicted OS from salvage independent of having (P=. 0020) or having not (P=. 0480) consolidated with SCT. Conclusions. MLH 1 rs 1799977 is an independent predictor of survival in DLBCL treated with R-CHOP. The biologic plausibility of this association is supported by four lines evidence: i) MLH 1 rs 1799977 is a nonsynonymous SNP causing the I 219 V amino acidic substitution on MLH 1, a gene of the mismatch repair pathway; ii) in silico, MLH 1 rs 1799977 is predicted to have deleterious consequences; iii) in vitro, the G variant allele of MLH 1 rs 1799977 associates with reduced MLH 1 protein expression; iv) loss of MLH 1 in tumor cells is known to induce refractoriness to doxorubicin and platinum compounds. Consistently, DLBCL carriers of the MLH 1 rs 1799977 AG/GG genotypes displayed poor OS possibly due to altered MLH 1 expression...|$|R
