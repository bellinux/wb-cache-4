60|$|It was not, however, {{till the}} seventeenth century that lace {{acquired}} a really independent character and individuality, and M. Duplessis states that {{the production of the}} more noteworthy of early laces owes more to the influence of men than to that of women. The reign of Louis XIV. witnessed the production of the most stately needle-point laces, the transformation of <b>Venetian</b> <b>point,</b> and the growth of Points d'Alencon, d'Argentan, de Bruxelles and d'Angleterre.|$|E
60|$|He guided me, hand on shoulder, into a babble of high-pitched {{talk and}} {{laughter}} that filled a vast drawing-room. He introduced {{me as the}} founder of the family fortunes to a little, lithe, dark-eyed woman whose speech and greeting were of the soft-lipped South. She in turn presented me to her mother, a black-browed snowy-haired old lady with a cap of priceless <b>Venetian</b> <b>point,</b> hands that must have held many hearts in their time, and a dignity as unquestioned and unquestioning as an empress. She was, indeed, a Burton of Savannah, who, on their own ground, out-rank the Lees of Virginia. The rest of the company came from Buffalo, Cincinnati, Cleveland and Chicago, with here and there a softening southern strain. A party of young folk popped corn beneath a mantelpiece surmounted by a Gainsborough. Two portly men, half hidden by a cased harp, discussed, over sheaves of typewritten documents, the terms of some contract. A knot of matrons talked servants--Irish versus German--across the grand piano. A youth ravaged an old bookcase, while beside him a tall girl stared at the portrait of a woman of many loves, dead three hundred years, but now leaping to life and warning under the shaded frame-light. In a corner half-a-dozen girls examined the glazed tables that held the decorations--English and foreign--of the late Lord Marshalton.|$|E
5000|$|... "Irish crochet" [...] was {{originally}} developed in mid-nineteenth century Ireland {{as a method}} of imitating expensive <b>Venetian</b> <b>point</b> laces. Within a few years it was being taught in almost every convent in the country and used part of Famine Relief Schemes. Charity groups sought to revive the economy by teaching crochet lace technique at no charge to anyone willing to learn. This type of lace is characterized by separately crocheted motifs, which were later assembled into a mesh background. Other types of Irish crochet include Rosslea and Clones lace.|$|E

5000|$|Needle lace, such as <b>Venetian</b> Gros <b>Point,</b> is {{made using}} a needle and thread. This {{is the most}} {{flexible}} of the lace-making arts. While some types can be made more quickly than the finest of bobbin laces, others are very time-consuming. Some purists regard needle lace as the height of lace-making. The finest antique needle laces were made from a very fine thread that is not manufactured today.|$|R
5000|$|Irish lace {{has always}} been an {{important}} part of the Irish needlework tradition. Both needlepoint and Bobbin-laces were made in Ireland before the middle of the eighteenth century, but never, apparently, on a commercial scale. It was promoted by Irish aristocrats such as Lady Arabella Denny, the famous philanthropist, who used social and political connections to support the new industry and promote the sale of Irish lace abroad. Lady Denny, working in connection with the Dublin Society, introduced lace-making into the Dublin workhouses, especially among the children there. [...] It is thought that it was an early form of Crochet, imitating the appearance of <b>Venetian</b> Gros <b>Point,</b> Point de Venise ...|$|R

In its dynamism and emphasis on the quotidian—the setting {{is similar to a}} <b>Venetian</b> inn—the painting <b>points</b> the way to the Baroque. [...] "The ability of this dramatic scene to engage viewers was well in keeping with Counter-Reformation ideals and the Catholic Church's belief in the didactic nature of religious art." ...|$|R

In 1499 he aided Ludovico Sforza, who was at war with the French and <b>Venetians.</b> At this <b>point</b> the Borgias decided to intervene. Pope Alexander VI sent his son Cesare Borgia to capture Imola and Forlì, claiming that dues had not been paid. Caterina and Ottaviano were deposed in January 1500.|$|R

"No {{wonder you}} should be under that mistake, for few even of the Greeks themselves, who live beyond the {{mountain}} boundary of Attica, {{know anything about the}} present condition of Athens, or Setine, as the sailors call it. I remember, as we were rounding the promontory of Sunium, the Greek pilot we had on board our <b>Venetian</b> galley <b>pointed</b> to the mighty columns that stand on the summit of the rock--the remains, as you know well, of the great temple erected to the goddess Athena, who looked down from that high shrine with triumph at her conquered rival Poseidon;--well, our Greek pilot, pointing to those columns, said, `That was the school of the great philosopher Aristotle.' And at Athens itself, the monk who acted as our guide in the hasty view we snatched, insisted most on showing us the spot where Saint Philip baptised the Ethiopian eunuch, or some such legend." ...|$|R
50|$|The building's most {{significant}} {{feature is the}} white terra cotta facade, which wraps around {{the south and east}} sides of the building. The facade was modeled after that of the Doge's Palace in Venice, with arcades of <b>pointed</b> <b>Venetian</b> Gothic arches, quatrefoil windows, and, following the 1934 rebuilding, an ornamental frieze with a row of finials. The spandrels and capitals are decorated with elaborate floral ornamentation, and the building's rounded corners are punctuated with pointed turrets. The tile used in both the original and rebuilt portions of the exterior was manufactured by the Denver Terra-Cotta Tile Company.|$|R
40|$|First {{published}} as an Advance Article {{on the web}} 21 st August 2001 In this paper, the differences and similarities in chemical composition between façon-de-Venise glass excavated in Antwerp and two types of Venetian glass, both from {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries, are documented. On the basis of typological criteria alone {{it is not possible to}} distinguish imported Venetian glass from locally produced glass. For this purpose, the major element composition of Antwerp and Venetian glass was studied with EPXMA (electron probe X-ray microanalysis) and, in a second phase, these objects were also analysed for their trace element content by means of SR-XRF (synchrotron radiation induced X-ray fluorescence analysis) and LA-ICP-MS (laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry). The largest group of Antwerp objects has a composition that significantly differs from truly <b>Venetian</b> compositions, <b>pointing</b> to an important local production. However, a few objects were found that have a major composition very similar to Venetian Cristallo and a larger group corresponds to the Venetian Vitrum Blanchum composition. In order to be able to make a more clear distinction between the Antwerp Cristallo and Venetian Cristallo glass types, to verify that indeed the Antwerp and Venetian Vitrum Blanchum compositions are identical and to understand better the causes of the compositional differences among the groups, the concentrations of a number of trace elements, possibly providing clues on the raw materials, were determined. 1...|$|R

Since touch increases probabilities of purchase, it places accessories where customers can feel the products. For example, Chanel has LED signage that visually promotes its signature tweed. In New York City, its flagship store lights up {{in the shape of a}} perfume bottle at night. Chanel’s London flagship store has a gravity-defying staircase and hand-blown <b>Venetian</b> glass focal <b>point</b> reminiscent of Gabrielle Chanel’s iconic pearls (Larocca 2013). The London store has curtains with hand-stitched pearls as a means of authenticating the brand. Chanel boutiques have a sitting area that features tweed chairs, plush carpet, fireplaces and coffee tables stacked with Chanel books on each floor for visual consistency (Karmali 2017). In addition, the store sprays Gabrielle Chanel’s classic Chanel No. 5 perfume to enhance the customer olfactory sensory experience (Larocca 2013). Indeed, Chanel is one of the successful brands that have utilized multi-sensory stimuli to intensify their customers’ experiences.|$|R

Then to the war; you know how Vaca de Castro was sent from Spain to bring order and justice where was naught but chaos, and the dance of all devils. We met him on the hills of Chupas. Peter of Candia, the <b>Venetian</b> villain, <b>pointed</b> our guns false, and Almagro stabbed him to the heart. We charged with our lances, man against man, horse against horse. All fights I ever fought" [...] (and the old man's eyes flashed out the ancient fire) [...] "were child's play to that day. Our lances shivered like reeds, and we fell on with battle-axe and mace. None asked for quarter, and none gave it; friend to friend, cousin to cousin--no, nor brother, O God! to brother. We were the better armed: but numbers were on their side. Fat Carbajal charged our cannon like an elephant, and took them; but Holguin was shot down. I was with Almagro, and we swept all before us, inch by inch, but surely, till the night fell. Then Vaca de Castro, the licentiate, the clerk, the schoolman, the man of books, came down on us with his reserve like a whirlwind. Oh! cavaliers, did not God fight against us, when He let us, the men of iron, us, the heroes of Cuzco and Vilcaconga, be foiled by a scholar in a black gown, with a pen behind his ear? We were beaten. Some ran; some did not run, senors; and I did not. Geronimo de Alvarado shouted to me, 'We slew Pizarro! We killed the tyrant!' and we rushed upon the conqueror's lances, to die like cavaliers. There was a gallant gentleman in front of me. His lance struck me in the crest, and bore me over my horse's croup: but mine, senors, struck him full in the vizor. We both went to the ground together, and the battle galloped over us.|$|R
