They were transferred south in two batches, and were replaced on the North Berwick branch by EWS Class 90 electric locomotives hauling former Virgin Trains Mk.3 coaching stock. To enable trains to reverse, the locomotive operates in push-pull mode with a Driving <b>Van</b> <b>Trailer.</b>|$|E

25|$|These {{trainsets}} {{were used}} on the ICE line 10 Berlin-Cologne/Bonn. However, since the driving <b>van</b> <b>trailers</b> of the trains were still awaiting approval, the DB joined two portions (with one powerhead each) to form a long train, similar to the ICE1. Only from 24 May 1998 were the ICE 2 units fully equipped with driving <b>van</b> <b>trailers</b> and could be portioned on their run from Hamm via either Dortmund Hbf – Essen Hbf – Duisburg Hbf – Düsseldorf Hbf or Hagen Hbf – Wuppertal Hbf – Solingen-Ohligs.|$|R

A dedicated fleet of four Class 67s (012-015) were repainted in Wrexham & Shropshire livery ready for the launch in April 2008 followed by a fifth (010) in April 2009.|$|E
500|$|The train {{travelled}} {{a further}} [...] after derailment. The leading locomotive {{and the first}} two coaches remained upright and on the rails.

[...] The restaurant coach, the eighth vehicle in the set, overturned onto its side and struck an overhead line gantry after derailing, resulting in severe damage to the vehicle. The whole incident occurred in 17 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|The older BR-vintage locomotive-hauled {{passenger}} {{rolling stock}} {{still has a}} limited role on the WCML, with the overnight Caledonian Sleeper services between London Euston and Scotland using Mark 3 and Mark 2 coaches.

2500|$|Following {{the loss}} of a Class 390 Pendolino in the Grayrigg derailment, a Mark 3 set with a Driving <b>Van</b> <b>Trailer</b> was leased with a [...] hired from English Welsh & Scottish as required. In 2008 Virgin looked at leasing two [...] but decided to retain the Mark 3 set. Nicknamed the Pretendolino, this {{received}} re-upholstered seating, power points, wi-fi and a full external re-paint at Wabtec, Doncaster in 2009. Virgin used this set with a Class 90 locomotive hired from Freightliner on a Euston to Crewe (via Birmingham) service on Fridays only until December 2012. From 9 December 2013 it was utilised to operate a London Euston -Birmingham New Street train on Thursdays and Fridays only, until its withdrawal in October 2014. The Mk.III set was also occasionally hired out as a private charter train. It was used in the filming of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and can be seen at King's Cross station {{at the end of the}} film. [...] It is currently in use as a 'hot spare' with Abellio Greater Anglia.|$|E
2500|$|... 11 May 1993. A train {{propelled}} by locomotive No 12 John Southland driven by Stuart Barratt was in collision {{with a white}} van at Eastbridge Road level crossing, Dymchurch. The train was an empty coaching stock (ECS) working which had earlier operated the daily school service for pupils returning home from New Romney. The locomotive was propelling from the rear, and the leading vehicle was Driving <b>Van</b> <b>Trailer</b> (DVT) No 105. The transit van and the railway DVT both fell into the dyke beside the road. The van driver was uninjured. The Guard, Simon Oldfield, who was travelling in the DVT, was briefly trapped under water, but was able to free himself and swim to safety. The DVT was heavily damaged {{and had to be}} completely rebuilt. During this rebuild it was adapted to become the railway's first wheelchair accessible coach. Two other passenger coaches, 804 and 807, were also seriously damaged in the incident. The van driver admitted fault but claimed that his brakes had failed. The subsequent police investigation revealed that the brakes had operated correctly, but that the van driver had vainly hoped to beat the train to the crossing. Police also found that the van's tyres were bald, and that it had no current road tax. A large crane recovered both vehicles from the water.|$|E
