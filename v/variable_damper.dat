5000|$|Sport bikes {{have a short}} {{wheelbase}} and an aggressive steering geometry to provide {{the ability to make}} very quick changes in direction. This has the harmful side-effect of making the bike less stable, more prone to feedback from uneven road surfaces, and more difficult to control. [...] If the front wheel significantly deviates from the direction of travel when it touches down, it may cause an unwanted wobble. Steering dampers are factory installed on some high-end sport motorcycles and fitted to most contemporary racing bikes to counter these behaviours.Steering dampers are also mounted to off-road motorcycles such as motocross bikes. A damper helps keep the bike tracking straight over difficult terrain such as ruts, rocks, and sand, and also smooths out jolts through the handlebars at the end of jumps. They also reduce arm fatigue by reducing the effort to control the handlebars.On motorcycles, one end of the damper is mounted to the steering yoke or triple tree, the other to the frame. Two main types are linear and rotary. Linear dampers resemble a telescoping shock absorber and operate in a similar manner. They can be aligned either longitudinally and {{to one side of the}} steering, or transversely across the bike. Rotary dampers resemble small boxes and operate via a rotating pivot. They are mounted coaxially with the steering axis and are typically located on top of the steering head. An electronically <b>variable</b> <b>damper</b> uses a rotary damper with hydraulic fluid that flows freely at low speeds, allowing easy turning, while restricting flow at higher speeds when more damping is necessary, as determined by the engine control unit.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of benchmark highway bridges using variable dampers under six bidirectional earthquake ground motions is presented. A viscous damper {{is used as}} a passive control device and a <b>variable</b> <b>damper,</b> developed from an MR (magnetorheological) damper, {{is used as a}} semi-active control device. The study is based on the simplified lumped-mass finite-element model of the 91 / 5 highway bridge in Southern California. The prime aim of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of viscous dampers and variable dampers with a friction-type damping force scheme and a two-step viscous damping force scheme, with important parametric variation. Velocity-and displacement-dependent models of a <b>variable</b> <b>damper</b> are used. Numerical simulations are conducted by installing the devices between the deck and abutments of the bridge. The seismic response of the bridge is compared with the corresponding uncontrolled case, and controlled by alternative sample control strategies. The results of the investigation clearly indicate that the base shear and mid-span displacement are reduced substantially by these protective devices. It is concluded that variable dampers are quite effective in considerably reducing the large bearing displacements, thereby eliminating the isolator damages. The control effect of a viscous damper, and the two pre-set damping schemes of a <b>variable</b> <b>damper</b> in particular, is quite satisfactory in reducing the peak response quantities of the bridge to a level comparable to or better than that of the sample passive, semi-active and active controllers...|$|E

A <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> control {{strategy has been}} developed for swing extension {{in order to improve}} gait symmetry and reduce energy expenditure during level ground walking. Preliminary biomechanical studies suggest that the knee utilizes a <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> control during swing extension. This thesis proposes a biologically inspired <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> control strategy which can be simplified into a piecewise function with respect to the knee angle. The <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> profile of the knee during swing extension has been modeled as an initial linear increase with respect to knee angle followed by a quadratic increase at the end of swing. A damping controller based on this proposed piecewise function has been implemented in a biomimetic, active, knee prosthesis (AAAKP) developed at MIT's Biomechatronics Lab. Preliminary studies on a unilateral, transfemoral amputee have shown that the AAAKP with the proposed damping control strategy is able to more closely emulate the damping profile of the unaffected leg, when compared to a conventional knee prosthesis (Otto Bock C-Leg®). This Initial study suggests that the proposed <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> strategy for swing extension is able to more accurately emulate the joint mechanics of the unaffected knee.

40|$|Abstract: In this study, the {{damping force}} {{algorithm}} called the viscous-plus-variable-friction damping force {{algorithm is proposed}} by combining advantageous features of typical viscous and friction dampers. The <b>variable</b> <b>damper</b> with the proposed algorithm can be represented by a viscous element placed in series with a variable-friction element. As a piston velocity increases from zero, the damping force is generated by the viscous element. This is aimed to allow energy dissipation at a small velocity. When the damping force reaches a peak value of the viscous element or a preset force limit, the sliding of the variable-friction element occurs, resulting in a constant damping force. A <b>variable</b> <b>damper</b> with the proposed damping force algorithm was developed using a magnetorheological (MR) damper. A series of cyclic loading tests of a MR damper was conducted to develop the mathematical model of the MR damper for control purpose. It is found that the proposed algorithm can be realized by the MR damper with a good accuracy. Subsequently, the MR damper was installed in the first story of a three-story steel model building. The model building is excited by a shaking table under a one-directional ground motion. It is found that the proposed damping force algorithm is effective in controlling the displacement, acceleration, and column displacement of the model building...|$|E
