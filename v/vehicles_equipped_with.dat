5|$|Safety {{played a}} {{substantial}} {{role in the}} development of the VX model. Bosch 5.3 anti-lock brakes were made standard on all variants, a first for an Australian manufactured car; and traction control was made available on <b>vehicles</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> manual transmission. Extensive research was undertaken to reduce the effects from a side-impact collision through modification of the B-pillars. The risk presented by a side-impact collision in a VX fitted without side airbags is reduced by 50percent when compared to a similarly specified VT model.|$|E

On March 17, 2013 Volkswagen Group China announced on its official Weibo that it will voluntarily recall <b>vehicles</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> DSG boxes. Some sources have estimated the failure rate of DSG-equipped vehicles sold in China to be greater than 20,000 per million sold.|$|E
25|$|A {{child safety}} seat (sometimes {{referred}} to as an infant safety seat, a child restraint system, a restraint car seat, or ambiguously as car seats), are seats designed specifically {{to protect children from}} injury or death during collisions. They are commonly used by children when riding in a vehicle. In 1960, Leonard Rivkin of Denver, Colorado invented the first child safe car seat for use in <b>vehicles</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> bucket seats. A patent was filed on March 5, 1962 and was issued on October 22, 1963.|$|E
25|$|Dirt buildup on {{headlamp}} lenses increases glare {{to other}} road users, even at levels {{too low to}} reduce seeing performance significantly for the driver. Therefore, headlamp lens cleaners are required by UN Regulation 48 on <b>vehicles</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> low-beam headlamps using light sources that have a reference luminous flux of 2,000 lumens or more. This includes all HID headlamps and some high-power halogen units. Some cars have lens cleaners fitted even where the regulations do not require them. North America, for example, does not use UN regulations, and FMVSS 108 does not require lens cleaners on any headlamps, though they are permitted.|$|E

25|$|<b>Vehicles</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> HID {{headlamps}} (except motorcycles) {{are required}} by ECE regulation 48 also to be equipped with headlamp lens cleaning systems and automatic beam leveling control. Both of these measures are intended to reduce the tendency for high-output headlamps to cause high levels of glare to other road users. In North America, ECE R48 does not apply and while lens cleaners and beam levelers are permitted, they are not required; HID headlamps are markedly less prevalent in the US, where they have produced significant glare complaints. Scientific study of headlamp glare has shown that for any given intensity level, the light from HID headlamps is 40% more glaring than the light from tungsten-halogen headlamps.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, GM {{announced}} a recall on all 1997–2003 Grand Prix GTP models (as well as sister car Buick Regal GS) {{due to a}} problem that causes fires in the engine compartment. Over 230 fires were reported. This recall affected over 200,000 <b>vehicles</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> the supercharged 3800 Series II engine. GM {{sent a letter to}} the owners of these vehicles on March 13, 2008, instructing them not to park in garages or carports until the problem was resolved. The recall for the Supercharged engine involved changing the left (front) valve cover gasket, as oil leaks onto the exhaust manifold may cause engine fires. Some believed this recall did not fix the fire problem, and instead the problem is likely faulty fuel rail quick disconnect o-rings. There have been reports of fires happening after the recall has been performed.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{consumer}} demand, the cassette has remained influential on design, {{more than a}} decade after its decline as a media mainstay. As the Compact Disc grew in popularity, cassette-shaped audio adapters were developed to provide an economical and clear way to obtain CD functionality in <b>vehicles</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> cassette decks. A portable CD player would have its analog line-out connected to the adapter, which in turn fed the signal {{to the head of the}} cassette deck. These adapters continue to function with MP3 players and smartphones, and generally are more reliable than the FM transmitters that must be used to adapt CD players and digital audio players to car stereo systems. Digital audio players shaped as cassettes have also become available, which can be inserted into any cassette player and communicate with the head as if they were normal cassettes.|$|E

25|$|Level {{of modern}} {{weapons in the}} Ground Forces is 42 per cent in late 2016. Two Iskander-M missile system brigade sets, over 60 Tornado-G MLRS and more than 20 Msta-SM {{self-propelled}} howitzers have been received in 2016. More than 70 upgraded Grad-M MLRS have been fielded too. Russian Land Forces received two brigade sets of Buk-M3 and Buk-M2 air defence missile complexes in 2016. Troops also received two division sets of Tor-M2 and two of Tor-M2U air defence missile complexes. Moreover, the Forces received Verba MANPADS, more than 130 BMP-3 IFVs and BTR-82A APCs {{as well as more}} than 20 Tigr-M armored <b>vehicles</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> the Arbalet-DM combat module. The Ground Troops reportedly received 2,930 new or modernized systems allowing for two missile brigades, two SAM brigades and two SAM regiments, one Spetsnaz brigade, 12 motorized rifle and tank battalions, and three artillery divisions to be reequipped.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{final drive ratio}} for <b>vehicles</b> <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> the 7-speed {{automatic}} has been (numerically) reduced from 3.69 to 3.36, the new 7-speed automatic has much lower first through fourth gear overall ratios than the old 5-speed automatic and the 6-speed manual in the 6MT cars (which retain the old 3.69 final drive ratio). Giving it closer gear ratios in all gears, to match engine rpm better with power demand, brings better acceleration while overdrive ratios in 6th and 7th gears reduces highway cruising rpm and improves fuel mileage. The new 7-speed automatic retains the Drive Sport (DS) shift mode and Downshift Rev Matching (DRM) feature of the previous 5-speed automatic. Paddle shifters are standard on G37S models equipped with the 7-speed automatic. The new engine/transmission combo did add some weight the car (3,590lb. for the G37 vs. 3,508 for the G35 in identical trim).|$|E
