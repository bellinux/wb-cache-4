In the PlayStation version, spells themselves do not cost mana in a traditional sense; after each use, a spell requires a cooling down period before it can be used again. The Windows version instead employs spells which cost mana to be cast. Spells also have a brief casting time, during which Drake is vulnerable to attack.|$|E

40|$|A {{substantial}} portion of information goods is sold through upgrades. I model a monopolist offering successive generations of an information good in a dynamic model. In each period, the monopolist offers up to two prices for each generation: a full price {{to those who have}} never purchased and a <b>version</b> <b>upgrade</b> price to consumers who own a previous generation. I employ an overlapping generations model with infinite-lived firms and consumers that reflects the effect of future profits on current decisions better than previous two-period models. The model's predictions accord well with data from the PC software industry. The model explains why: 1) firms issued version upgrades with every new generation, 2) firms provided a discount to those upgrading relative to first-time buyers and 3) late adopters commonly purchased the latest version at full price even though some earlier adopters with higher valuations did not upgrade to the latest version. ...|$|E
40|$|When SAS {{projects}} and applications require {{the latest and}} greatest, their success or failure is laid open to the whim of technology's &quot;bleeding edge. &quot; This quasi-obsessive need for change cuts through our corporate culture, holding little regard for whether that change is necessary or in the corporation's best interest. Knowing {{how and when to}} migrate is critical. Research, planning, testing, and benchmarking should be critical tasks in your migration efforts. Migration, by its very nature, exposes an organization to a heavy dose of risk. When you choose the road less traveled and ignore the risk, your project may just end up in a heap {{on the side of the}} road as the &quot;bleeding edge &quot; arrives via an OS upgrade, hardware platform migration, or SAS <b>version</b> <b>upgrade.</b> The purpose of this paper is to describe how changes in hardware platforms, software applications, and operating systems can dramatically affect the capabilities, reliability, and performance of the SAS System...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{details the}} early phases of ongoing {{research}} {{in the context of}} a business process redesign initiative in an ERP implementation at a mid-sized research university in the United States. This university has adopted the ERP technology in most areas of the administrative system. However, initial assessments of the implementation have determined that, while the technical aspects of the implementation have been largely successful, the university has generally failed to take advantage of the system capabilities in changing silo processes to enterprise processes. In response, the administration has formed a specific enterprise process improvement initiative to coincide with an impending major ERP <b>version</b> <b>upgrade.</b> The researcher employs an interpretive case study methodology to document how the university tries to develop a culture of enterprise thinking to align the organization with the ERP. The study focuses on the activities of a newly-formed team of process improvement managers. Perspectives from symbolic interactionism emphasizing the influence of self and reference groups in human actions provide theoretical guidance in examining the cultural dynamic...|$|E

40|$|Platform {{has played}} an {{important}} role in telecommunication industry. As the industry evolves from value chain to value network industry, firms can no longer pursue innovation and maintain competitiveness solely by improving value chain activities. Rather, they have to become a platform intermediary among various participants' value network. Firms that successfully built up and internalized the platform now lead the telecommunication industry: on one side, there's opened Android platform, and on the other side, there's closed iOS platform. Each platform provider employs different platform policies, and these policies show different characteristics in the diffusion of each platform. To illustrate, the adoption rates of new operating systems are different: Android has adopted open policy, so it enjoyed relatively fast growth, but lags the adoption rate of new version's installed base far behind that of iOS. Meanwhile, iOS has adopted proprietary policy, so it the growth of user adoption was relatively slower than Android. However, frequent upgrade of Android platform resulted in so called fragmentation: while consumers enjoy wider choice of devices under opened platform, not all end users get benefit of <b>version</b> <b>upgrade</b> and this sometimes eliminates surplus generated around the platform. We see smaller fragmentation in more proprietary platform, iOS. In this study, the difference in the diffusion patterns of open and closed platforms will be analyzed using system dynamics analysis, and then the managerial implication regarding the policy and diffusion pattern will be discussed. (1) The diffusion of those two different types of platforms will be modelled using system dynamics modeling. To incorporate open and closed policy in the model, each model will be constructed in parallel. These models will be fit into historical data and used to predict the future trend. Predicted trend will be compared with real data to evaluate the accuracy of the model. (2) As a second step, the effect of open and close platform policy on diffusion pattern will be tested with variables used in the modeling. (3) Lastly, sensitivity test will be conducted to see whether platform intermediaries or platform participants can somehow manipulate the speed of diffusion. by Ilbae Yoon. Thesis: S.
