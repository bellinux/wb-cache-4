40|$|This paper {{documents}} research {{exploring the}} issues in using <b>visual</b> <b>sensing</b> to control an underwater robot. The local nature of <b>visual</b> <b>sensing</b> makes it useful for underwater situations in which the exact global location of the robot is not accurately known. In these situations, the relative measurement obtained from <b>visual</b> <b>sensing</b> {{can be used for}} precise control of the vehicle. To perform <b>visual</b> <b>sensing</b> in an underwater environment, several challenges must be overcome. In addition to standard vision processing issues, extreme lighting variations and marine snow make <b>visual</b> <b>sensing</b> problematic. To handle these di culties, an approach using Laplacian of Gaussian sign correlation hardware has been chosen which o ers robust real-time optical ow and stereo disparity measurements. This approach has been applied to several representative underwater vehicle tasks including: 1) object following, 2) station keeping, 3) mosaicking, and 4) navigation. Local sensing One of the largest problems in achieving automatic control of underwater vehicles is adequate sensing capability. Unlike land and space regimes for which GPS is available, there is no global position measurement system in place underwater. 1 Long baseline and other sonic beacon systems can be used in many situations; however, these systems cover limited areas and provide inadequate accuracies and update rates for many applications. A promising alternative to such systems is control from local sensors. Using local sensors for control o ers several advantages. The accuracy and bandwidth achievable with local sensors is much greater. In addition, the accuracies of many local sensors increase with proximity. Local sensors are carried on board and are self-contained. They do not rely upon proper functioning of external system...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} climatic extremes, {{the frequency and}} severity of urban flood events have intensified worldwide. In this study, image-based automated monitoring of flood formation and analyses of water level fluctuation were proposed as value-added intelligent sensing applications to turn a passive monitoring camera into a visual sensor. Combined with the proposed <b>visual</b> <b>sensing</b> method, traditional hydrological monitoring cameras {{have the ability to}} sense and analyze the local situation of flood events. This can solve the current problem that image-based flood monitoring heavily relies on continuous manned monitoring. Conventional sensing networks can only offer one-dimensional physical parameters measured by gauge sensors, whereas visual sensors can acquire dynamic image information of monitored sites and provide disaster prevention agencies with actual field information for decision-making to relieve flood hazards. The <b>visual</b> <b>sensing</b> method established in this study provides spatiotemporal information {{that can be used for}} automated remote analysis for monitoring urban floods. This paper focuses on the determination of flood formation based on image-processing techniques. The experimental results suggest that the <b>visual</b> <b>sensing</b> approach may be a reliable way for determining the water fluctuation and measuring its elevation and flood intrusion with respect to real-world coordinates. The performance of the proposed method has been confirmed; it has the capability to monitor and analyze the flood status, and therefore, it can serve as an active flood warning system...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to energy}} and {{throughput}} constraints of <b>visual</b> <b>sensing</b> nodes, in-node energy conservation {{is one of}} the prime concerns in visual sensor networks (VSNs) with wireless transceiving capability. To cope with these constraints, the energy efficiency of a VSN for a given level of reliability can be enhanced by reconfiguring its nodes dynamically to achieve optimal configurations. In this paper, a unified framework for node classification and dynamic self-reconfiguration in VSNs is proposed. The proposed framework incorporates quality-of-information (QoI) awareness using peak signal-to-noise ratio-based representative metric to support a diverse range of applications. First, for a given application, the proposed framework provides a feasible solution for the classification of <b>visual</b> <b>sensing</b> nodes based on their field-of-view by exploiting the heterogeneity of the targeted QoI within the sensing region. Second, with the dynamic realization of QoI, a strategy is devised for selecting suitable configurations of <b>visual</b> <b>sensing</b> nodes to reduce redundant visual content prior to transmission without sacrificing the expected information retrieval reliability. The robustness of the proposed framework is evaluated under various scenarios by considering: 1) target QoI thresholds; 2) degree of heterogeneity; and 3) compression schemes. From the simulation results, it is observed that for the second degree of heterogeneity in targeted QoI, the unified framework outperforms its existing counterparts and results in up to 72...|$|R
