5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> <b>cloud</b> is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, {{such as the}} windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E

40|$|The {{forecast}} accuracy of distal <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> <b>clouds</b> {{is important for}} providing valid aviation advice during <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> eruption. However, because the distal part of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> plume {{is far from the}} volcano, the influence of eruption information on this part becomes rather indirect and uncertain, resulting in inaccurate <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> forecasts in these distal areas. In our approach, we use real-life aircraft in situ observations, measured in the northwestern part of Germany during the 2010  Eyjafjallajökull eruption, in an ensemble-based data assimilation system combined with a <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> transport model to investigate the potential improvement on the {{forecast accuracy}} with regard to the distal <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> plume.

40|$|It {{is clear}} that no-fly zone of the {{airplane}} during a volcanic eruption has the great influence on the economic activity of the area, based on the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland.

However, during the volcanic eruption of Iceland, European aviation authorities took the measure which loosens no-fly zone of an airplane according to the concentration of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> in order to avoid confusion of an air route at an early stage. In that case, the diffusion of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> <b>clouds</b> grasps viewing or a satellite photograph, and the concentration of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> is measured by LIDAR (detection by a laser picture) and the dust meter in the light airplane.

40|$|The 2008 Chaitén Volcano {{eruption}} {{began on}} 2 May 2008 with an explosive phase that injected {{large amounts of}} tephra into the atmosphere.

Tephra deposition extended to the Atlantic Ocean and severely affected the Argentinean Patagonia. Impacts included air and water quality degradation, disruption of ground transportation systems and cancellation of flights at airports more than 1, 500 km apart. We use the FALL 3 D tephra transport model coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting-Advanced Research Weather (WRF-ARW) meteorological model to simulate tephra fall from the 2 - 9 May 2008 eruptive period. Our hindcast results are in good agreement with satellite imagery and reproduce ground deposit observations.

40|$|International audienceMajor {{disruptions}} of {{the aviation}} system from recent volcanic eruptions have intensified discussions {{and increased the}} international consensus to improve <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> warnings.

Civil aviation authorities banned all flight operations because of {{the threat posed by}} <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> to modern turbine aircraft. New quantitative airborne ash mass concentration thresholds, still under discussion, were adopted for discerning regions contaminated by ash. This has implications for ash dispersal models routinely used to forecast the evolution of <b>ash</b> <b>clouds.</b> In this new context, quantitative model validation and assessment of the accuracies of current state-of-the-art models is of paramount importance. The passage of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> <b>clouds</b> over central Europe, a territory hosting a dense network of meteorological and air quality observatories, generated a quantity of observations unusual for volcanic clouds. From the ground, the cloud was observed by aerosol lidars, lidar ceilometers, sun photometers, other remote-sensing instruments and in-situ collectors. From the air, sondes and multiple aircraft measurements also took extremely valuable in-situ and remote-sensing measurements. These measurements constitute an excellent database for model validation. Here we validate the FALL 3 D ash dispersal model by comparing model results with ground and airplane-based measurements obtained during the initial 14 e 23 April 2010 Eyjafjallajökull explosive phase. We run the model at high spatial resolution using as input hourlyaveraged observed heights of the eruption column and the total grain size distribution reconstructed from field observations. Model results are then compared against remote ground-based and in-situ aircraft-based measurements, including lidar ceilometers from the German Meteorological Service, aerosol lidars and sun photometers from EARLINET and AERONET networks, and flight missions of the German DLR Falcon aircraft. We find good quantitative agreement, with an error similar to the spread in the observations (however depending on the method used to estimate mass eruption rate) for both airborne and ground mass concentration. Such verification results help us understand and constrain the accuracy and reliability of ash transport models and it is of enormous relevance for designing future operational mitigation strategies at <b>Volcanic</b> <b>Ash</b> Advisory Centers...|$|R

40|$|Doswell has {{proposed}} a mechanism for mammatus called double-diffusive convection, the mechanism responsible for salt fingers in the ocean. The physics of salt fingers and mammatus are different. Unlike the ocean where the diffusivity is related to molecular motions within solution, the hydrometeors in clouds are affected by inertial and gravitational forces. Doswell misinterprets the vertical temperature profiles through mammatus and fails to understand the role of settling in <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> <b>clouds.</b> Furthermore, given that mixing {{is a much more}} effective means of transferring heat in the atmosphere and given idealized numerical model simulations of mammatus showing that the destabilizing effect of subcloud sublimation is an effective mechanism for mammatus, this reply argues that double-diffusive convection is unlikely to explain mam-matus, either in cumulonimbus anvils or in <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> <b>clouds.</b> In preparing our review article on mammatus (Schultz et al. 2006), we were amazed at the number of previously published papers that would make claims about mammatus mechanisms without considering the observational evidence or offering simple physical ar-guments to support or refute their proposed mecha-nisms. Before and after publication of our review, some people would make the claim to us that salt fingers formed by double-diffusive convection in the ocean were analogous to mammatus. Admittedly, the physical appearance of salt fingers and their development along a boundary between two fluids provides a seductive analogy to mammatus. Repeatedly, we asked these pro-ponents of the salt-fingers analogy for a simple physical argument, scale analysis, or theoretical calculation that could serve as a testable hypothesis to support or refute this proposed mechanism. Yet, we have received none. Unfortunately, Doswell’s (2008) comment admits to not delivering such supporting evidence either...|$|R
40|$|The reverse {{absorption}} {{technique is}} often used to detect <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> <b>clouds</b> from thermal infrared satellite measurements. From these measurements effective particle radius and mass loading may be estimated using radiative transfer modelling. The radiative transfer modelling usually assumes that the ash particles are spherical. We calculated thermal infrared optical properties of highly irregular and porous ash particles and compared these with mass- and volume-equivalent spherical models. Furthermore, brightness temperatures pertinent to satellite observing geometry were calculated for the different ash particle shapes. Non-spherical shapes and volume-equivalent spheres were found to produce a detectable ash signal for larger particle sizes than mass-equivalent spheres. The assumption of mass-equivalent spheres for ash mass loading estimates was found to underestimate mass loading compared to morphologically complex inhomogeneous ash particles. The underestimate increases with the mass loading. For an <b>ash</b> <b>cloud</b> recorded during the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruption, the mass-equivalent spheres underestimate the total mass of the <b>ash</b> <b>cloud</b> by approximately 30 % compared to the morphologically complex inhomogeneous particles...|$|R
