ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Thirty {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} were isolated from the intestinal tract of Drosophila simulans Stuvervant and nine {{lactic acid bacteria}} from Merlot grapes collected from the same winery in the Stellenbosch region, South Africa. The isolates were grouped according to morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics. Isolates selected from each group were identified to species level by PCR with species-specific primers, PCR-based DGGE and 16 S rDNA sequencing. The majority of isolates from the intestinal tract of Drosophila simulans Stuvervant belonged to the species Lactobacillus plantarum, but Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis and Pediococcus pentosaceus were also identified. As far as we could determine, {{this is the first}} report on the isolation of L. paracasei, L. sanfranciscensis, L. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, L. lactis subsp. lactis, E. faecalis and P. pentosaceus from <b>vinegar</b> <b>flies.</b> Lactobacillus plantarum has previously been isolated from Merlot grapes. The genotypic relatedness among isolates of L. plantarum isolated from the intestinal tract of <b>vinegar</b> <b>flies</b> and from Merlot grapes were determined by RAPD-PCR. The isolates were grouped into four genotypically well-separated clusters. Thirteen isolates from grape must and five from flies yielded identical RAPD-PCR banding patterns and grouped into one cluster, suggesting that they are descendants from the same strain. This suggests that L. plantarum has the ability to use <b>vinegar</b> <b>flies</b> as a vector. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Dertig melksuurbakterieë is vanuit die dermkanaal van Drosophila simulans Stuvervant geïsoleer en nege melksuurbakterieë vanuit Merlot-druiwe. Die druiwe is afkomstig van dieselfde wynkelder in die Stellenbosch-area van Suid-Afrika. Die isolate is volgens morfologiese, biochemiese en fisiologiese eienskappe gegroepeer. Verteenwoordigende isolate vanuit die fenotipiese groepe is tot spesievlak met behulp van lukraak ge-amplifiseerde polimorfe-DNA (RAPD) polimerase ketting-reaksie (PKR), PKR met spesie-spesifieke inleiers, PKR-gebaseerde denaturerende gradient-jel elektroforese (DGGE) en 16 S rDNA sekwensering geïdentifiseer. Die meerderheid isolate uit die ingewande van Drosophila simulans Stuvervant is as Lactobacillus plantarum geklassifiseer. Stamme van Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis en Pediococcus pentosaceus is ook geïdentifiseer. Sover bekend, is dit die eerste keer dat L. paracasei, L. sanfranciscensis, L. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, L. lactis subsp. lactis, E. faecalis en P. pentosaceus uit asynvlieë geïsoleer is. Lactobacillus plantarum is voorheen uit Merlot-druiwe geïsoleer. Die genotipiese ooreenkoms tussen die stamme van L. plantarum wat uit die asynvlieë en Merlot-druiwe geïsoleer is, is deur middel van RAPD-PKR bepaal. Hiervolgens is die stamme in vier genotipies goed-gedefinieerde groepe geplaas. Dertien isolate vanuit druiwemos en vyf vanuit asynvlieë het identiese RAPD-PKR bandpatrone vertoon en het in een groep gesorteer. Hierdie resultate dui daarop dat die stamme heel moontlik uit een voorouer ontstaan het en dat asynvlieë heel moontlik as vektor vir L. plantarum dien...|$|R

40|$|To {{choose their}} mates, {{male and female}} <b>vinegar</b> <b>flies</b> (Drosophila melanogaster) perform a duet of stereotyped, sexually dimorphic {{courtship}} behaviors, a suite of sensory back-and-forth that offers an excellent model for studying the neural circuitry of complex behavior (Dickson, 2008). However, the study of Drosophila courtship has focused overwhelmingly on the male, and {{little is known about}} how the female evaluates male courtship to decide whether to mate and how she executes that decision by slowing down and opening vaginal plates, a process known as receptivity. To expand the mechanistic understanding of Drosophila receptivity, we set out to identify neurons directly involved in this behavior. Using a genome-wide neuronal RNAi screen, we identified a requirement for Abdominal-B (Abd-B), a homeobox transcription factor, in virgin female sexual receptivity. Silencing adult Abd-B neurons in the abdominal ganglion and reproductive tract decreased female receptivity. Whereas previous work measured copulation, we quantified movement using automated tracking and vaginal plate opening using magnified video recording. We show that “slowing down” is actually pausing, rather than walking more slowly. Silencing Abd-B neurons decreased pausing but did not affect vaginal plate opening, demonstrating that these two aspects of female sexual behavior are functionally separable. Synthetic activation of Abd-B neurons increased pausing, but playback of male courtship song alone was not sufficient to elicit this behavior. Therefore the female integrates multiple sensory cues from the male prior to copulation. We conclude that Abd-B neurons control female pausing in response to male courtship and that this is a key aspect of female sexual receptivity...|$|R

40|$|Across many species, animals {{carefully}} regulate {{their food}} intake {{according to their}} energy needs. They {{are able to do}} so through the ability to sense hunger or satiety cues. In vertebrates, these signals are released by the gastrointestinal tract and by adipose tissue, and reach feeding centers in the brain, where they stimulate the release of peptides that modulate feeding behavior (Benarroch, 2010; Berthoud, 2008). Although many of these neuronal populations have been identified in rodent models, the neural circuitry behind behavioral modification of food intake remains largely unknown. Insects like the blowfly and the locust have classically been used to describe basic features of feeding behavior (Bernays and Chapman, 1974; Dethier, 1976). These animals, as well as <b>vinegar</b> <b>flies</b> and mosquitoes have been shown to modify their feeding behavior according to their internal nutritional status (Edgecomb et al., 1994; Takken et al., 2001). Thus they are good models for examining the question of how this modulation of behavior occurs. Moreover, Drosophila melanogaster has been used to study mechanisms of complex behaviors to great effect, and there are ample genetic tools available to study feeding behavior in this organism (Vosshall, 2007). We set out to identify genes that regulate feeding behavior according to nutritional status. Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes were previously shown to display reduced host-seeking behavior for forty-eight hours after taking a bloodmeal (Takken et al., 2001). We used whole genome microarrays to look for genes that are regulated in olfactory tissue by blood-feeding, and that therefore might function to modify olfactory driven host-seeking behavior according to nutritional state. We found that two odorant receptor genes are significantly regulated by blood-feeding. These are therefore candidate receptors for ligands that are important for host-seeking. We then extended our studies to Drosophila with the goal of identifying novel regulators of post-fasting feeding behavior. First we defined two stereotypical post-fasting behaviors in flies: increased attraction to food odor, and increased consumption of liquid food. We then looked for candidate genes that regulate these behaviors by looking for transcripts that are regulated by fasting and found that 247 genes in the head are significantly regulated by nutritional status. Finally, we carried out a targeted genetic screen using RNA interference against these candidate genes. We looked for flies that show a defective post fasting food intake response, and found eleven genes that cause such a behavioral disruption. These genes may represent novel regulators of hunger and satiety in insects, laying the groundwork for future studies of modification of feeding behavior...|$|R
40|$|Behavioural {{responses}} of animals to volatiles {{in their environment}} are generally dependent on context. Most natural odours are mixtures of components that can each induce different behaviours when presented on their own. We have investigated how a complex of two olfactory stimuli is evaluated by Drosophila flies in a free-flying two-trap choice assay and how these stimuli are encoded in olfactory receptor neurons. We first observed that volatiles from apple cider <b>vinegar</b> attracted <b>flies</b> while carbon dioxide (CO 2) was avoided, confirming their inherent positive and negative values. In contradiction with previous results obtained from walking flies in a four-field olfactometer, in the present assay the addition of CO 2 to vinegar increased rather than decreased the attractiveness of vinegar. This effect was female-specific even though males and females responded similarly to CO 2 and vinegar on their own. To test whether the female-specific behavioural response to the mixture correlated with a sexual dimorphism at the peripheral level we recorded from olfactory receptor neurons stimulated with vinegar, CO 2 and their combination. Responses to vinegar were obtained from three neuron classes, two of them housed with the CO 2 -responsive neuron in ab 1 sensilla. Sensitivity of these neurons to both CO 2 and vinegar per se did not differ {{between males and females}} and responses from female neurons did not change when CO 2 and vinegar were presented simultaneously. We also found that CO 2 -sensitive neurons are particularly well adapted to respond rapidly to small concentration changes irrespective of background CO 2 levels.

40|$|Olfaction is {{the single}} most studied means of insect chemoreception.

The olfactory system of the <b>vinegar</b> <b>fly,</b> Drosophila melanogaster, serves as a genetically and anatomically simple model for studying how sensory input is translated into behavioral output, because only two synapses isolate the input peripheral detection of ecologically relevant olfactory signals from the output behavioral navigation. This genetic and anatomical simplicity of the Drosophila olfactory system allowed us to further our understanding of the Drosophila olfactory neuroecology.

40|$|White-eyed {{forms and}} gynandromorphs {{of the wood}} wasp Sirex noctilo F. (Hymenoptera: Siricidae) are {{recorded}} from Victorian Pinus radiara D. Don hosts. It is the first record of these aberrant forms in S. noctilio. Sirex-infested radiata pine billets Pinus rudiatu D. Don, are caged in Victoria annually to provide host material for the parasite breeding programme of the National Sirex campaign. This gives an oppor-tunity to examine large populations of wood wasps Sirex noctilio F. (Hymenoptera: Siricidae) for aberrant forms, {{some of which are}} discussed below. White-eyed forms Four male wasps with white compound eyes and white ocelli, quite distinct from the normal black eyes (Plate IA), were collected from approximately 15, 000 insects that emerged in 1964. Since then, subsequent generations of Sirex were inspected for the abnormality, {{but it was not until}} 1970 that another white-eyed male and, for the first time, a similar female were collected. There is no previous record of this abnormality in S. noctilio. In the <b>vinegar</b> <b>fly</b> Drosophila rnelanogaster Meigen (Diptera: Drosophilidae) Morgan found white...|$|E
