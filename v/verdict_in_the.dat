5|$|A <b>verdict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{case was}} {{scheduled}} to be announced on 25 July, but was deferred until 5 August and then deferred again to 19 August.

The juvenile was released on 20 December 2015.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>verdict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{case was}} handed down on 29 August 2012 by Judge Jyotsna Yagnik. The special trial court convicted Maya Kodnani, the sitting Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Naroda and former Minister for Women and Child Development of Gujarat, and Bajrang Dal {{politician}} Babu Bajrangi under Indian Penal Code Section 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and 302 (murder). It also convicted 30 other people of murder, criminal conspiracy and other criminal charges, and acquitted 29 accused, {{giving them the}} benefit of the doubt as there was lack of evidence against them. Kodnai was the first woman, MLA and minister to be convicted in the Gujarat riot case. Suresh Dedawala (Richard) alias Langado and accomplices were convicted of rape and murder along with accomplices.|$|E
5|$|Days {{after the}} 2011 {{parliamentary}} elections in early December 2011, {{it was suggested}} by Vesna Pusić– already recognized as the future Minister of Foreign and European Affairs– that the referendum should be postponed until March 2012 to allow better preparation for the poll. The suggestion was soon followed by a similar request made by GONG that the referendum be postponed until mid-February or later; its request was also supported by five major trade unions. GONG's request was made {{because of what they}} stated to be: poor information provided to citizens; undefined procedures for voter registration away from a voter's permanent residence; unclear directions for voting abroad; no legal provisions specifically defining the composition of ballot counting commissions; no provisions for referendum vote monitoring by partisan, non-partisan and foreign monitors; no legal provisions regarding referendum funding (since the 2011 state budget did not appropriate any funds to cover referendum expenses); no legal provisions funding the pro-referendum campaign or allowing the campaign itself; and the lack of restrictions against campaigning {{on the day of the}} referendum. The union support for this request was due to the government's ultimately not putting forward the other referendum (altering the conditions for referendums from citizens by changing the number of petitioners required and the time allowed to gather their signatures), which they had earlier agreed to do. Another request to postpone the election was made by more than a thousand signatories of a petition to the government, demanding that the referendum be postponed until after the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) returned the final <b>verdict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case against generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač. They cited concerns over EU support for the ICTY, which they describe as biased; they therefore questioned if the EU favoured some nations over others.|$|E

25|$|Scholarly {{research}} on jury behavior in American non-capital criminal felony trials reveals that juror outcomes appear {{to track the}} opinions of the median juror, rather than {{the opinions of the}} extreme juror on the panel, although juries were required to render unanimous <b>verdicts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jurisdictions studied. Thus, although juries must render unanimous <b>verdicts,</b> <b>in</b> run-of-the-mill criminal trials they behave in practice as if they were operating using a majority rules voting system.|$|R

40|$|English juries do {{not provide}} reasons for their verdicts. This paper argues that {{transparency}} is a fundamental value in modern decision making, and that reform is needed to trial by jury so that verdicts are routinely accompanied by explanations.

30|$|In medical specialties, {{multidisciplinary}} case conferences are conventional {{in hospital}} practice.

There is considerable variation amongst coroners <b>in</b> <b>verdicts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK and consensus conferencing should be a routine service to coroners to try to decrease variation and increase accuracy (Tormey & Moore 2012 a).|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} high profile verdict was of Abdul Quader Molla, {{assistant}} secretary general of Jamaat, who was convicted in February 2013 and sentenced to life imprisonment culminating in the massive Shahbag protests.

Abdul Quader Molla was subsequently executed on Thursday 12 December 2013 amidst controversies on {{the legitimacy of the}} war tribunal hearings drawing wide criticisms from countries such as US, UK and Turkey and also the UN. A period of unrest ensued. The majority of the population were however found to be in favour of the execution.|$|E
25|$|File sharing {{researcher}} Daniel Johansson {{called the}} ruling {{the most important}} file sharing related verdict in Europe so far, comparing it to the Napster <b>verdict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US. The sentence is the longest ever awarded under Swedish copyright law, and the prison time and damage compensation high by Swedish standards. While most legal experts expected the court to find the defendants guilty, they were surprised at the harsh verdict. Sociology of law professor Håkan Hyden criticised the exceptionally harsh sentence on both the prison time and large amount of compensation awarded, and some legal analysts expect the punishments to be radically lowered in higher courts.|$|E
25|$|This, of course, is {{not always}} true. Patients do {{sometimes}} lie to their doctors (to get painkillers {{to which they are}} not entitled, for example). Hearsay exceptions do not mandate that a trier of fact (the jury or, in non-jury trials, the judge) accept the hearsay statement as being true. Hearsay exceptions mean only that the trier of fact will be informed of the hearsay statement and will be allowed to consider it when deciding on a <b>verdict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case. The jury is free to disregard a hearsay statement if the jury does not believe it. The hearsay rule controls only what out-of-court statements a trier of fact gets to consider in deciding a case, not how they consider the out-of-court statements.|$|E

25|$|Ibrahim is {{believed}} to have ordered and helped organise the bombings in Mumbai, through one of his subordinates, Tiger Memon.

The Indian authorities have also alleged the involvement of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, in the blasts. On 16 June 2017 giving its <b>verdict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1993 Mumbai bomb-blast case, a Special Terrorism and Disruptive Activities Act court pronounced gangster Mustafa Dossa and Firoz Khan guilty of conspiracy.

25|$|In early August 2010, a {{group of}} nine experts, {{including}} former coroners {{and a professor of}} intensive-care medicine, {{wrote a letter to the}} British newspaper The Times questioning Lord Hutton's verdict.

She cast further doubt on the circumstances surrounding the death of Kelly, and also criticised Hutton's handling of the inquiry. She joined other experts questioning the official finding that Kelly had bled to death and argued that it was more likely that he had suffered a heart attack due to the stress he had been placed under. This intervention came as Michael Howard, the former Conservative Party leader, became the most prominent politician to call for a full inquest into Kelly's death.|$|E
