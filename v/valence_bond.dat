25|$|In {{terms of}} <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> theory, in each carbon atom the 2s orbital hybridizes with one 2p orbital thus forming an sp hybrid. The other two 2p orbitals remain unhybridized. The two {{ends of the}} two sp hybrid orbital overlap to form a strong σ <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> between the carbons, while {{on each of the}} other two ends {{hydrogen}} atoms attach also by σ bonds. The two unchanged 2p orbitals form a pair of weaker π bonds.|$|E
25|$|A <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> theory {{approach}} considering just s and p orbitals {{would describe}} the bonding {{in terms of}} resonance between two resonance structures.|$|E
50|$|Elements {{in a high}} {{oxidation}} state can have a valence higher than four. For example, in perchlorates, chlorine has seven <b>valence</b> <b>bonds</b> and ruthenium, in the +8 {{oxidation state}} in ruthenium tetroxide, has eight <b>valence</b> <b>bonds.</b>|$|R

50|$|He first {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} possible tetrahedral arrangement of <b>valence</b> <b>bonds</b> in carbon compounds in 1862.|$|R
25|$|Similarly, {{theories}} from classical physics {{can be used}} {{to predict}} many ionic structures. With more complicated compounds, such as metal complexes, <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> theory is less applicable and alternative approaches, such as the molecular orbital theory, are generally used. See diagram on electronic orbitals.|$|E
25|$|After the {{development}} of quantum mechanics, two basic theories were proposed to provide a quantum description of chemical bonding: <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> (VB) theory and molecular orbital (MO) theory. A more recent quantum description is given in terms of atomic contributions to the electronic density of states.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that the matter of the {{rotational}} barrier of ethane is not settled within the scientific community. An analysis within quantitative molecular orbital theory shows that 2-orbital-4-electron (steric) repulsions are dominant over hyperconjugation. A <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> theory study also emphasizes the importance of steric effects.|$|E
50|$|If the {{structure}} of a compound is known, the empirical <b>bond</b> <b>valence</b> - <b>bond</b> length correlation of Eq. 2 can be used to estimate the <b>bond</b> <b>valences</b> from their observed bond lengths. Eq. 1 can then be used to check that {{the structure}} is chemically valid; any deviation between the atomic <b>valence</b> and the <b>bond</b> <b>valence</b> sum needs to be accounted for.|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{two-dimensional}} S= 1 / 2 square-lattice antiferromagnet $Cu(pz) _ 2 (ClO_ 4) _ 2 $ using inelastic neutron scattering and series expansion calculations. We show {{that the presence of}} antiferromagnetic next-nearest neighbor interactions enhances quantum fluctuations associated with resonating <b>valence</b> <b>bonds.</b> Intermediate magnetic fields lead to a selective tuning of resonating <b>valence</b> <b>bonds</b> and a spectacular inversion of the zone-boundary dispersion, providing novel insight into 2 D antiferromagnetism in the quantum limit.

25|$|His work on {{chemical}} bonding marks {{him as one}} of {{the founders}} of modern quantum chemistry. The Nature of the Chemical Bond was the standard work for many years, and concepts like hybridization and electronegativity remain part of standard chemistry textbooks. While his <b>Valence</b> <b>bond</b> approach fell short of accounting quantitatively for some of the characteristics of molecules, such as the color of organometallic complexes, and would later be eclipsed by the molecular orbital theory of Robert Mulliken, <b>Valence</b> <b>Bond</b> Theory still competes, in its modern form, with Molecular Orbital Theory and density functional theory (DFT) as a way of describing the chemical phenomena. Pauling's work on crystal structure contributed significantly to the prediction and elucidation of the structures of complex minerals and compounds. His discovery of the alpha helix and beta sheet is a fundamental foundation for the study of protein structure.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{molecules}} such as xenon difluoride and {{sulfur hexafluoride}} have higher co-ordination numbers {{than would be}} possible due to strictly covalent bonding according to the octet rule. This is explained by the three-center four-electron bond ("3c–4e") model which interprets the molecular wavefunction in terms of non-bonding highest occupied molecular orbitals in molecular orbital theory and ionic-covalent resonance in <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> theory.|$|E
25|$|A {{chemical}} bond {{can be a}} covalent bond, an ionic bond, a hydrogen bond or just because of Van der Waals force. Each {{of these kinds of}} bonds is ascribed to some potential. These potentials create the interactions which hold atoms together in molecules or crystals. In many simple compounds, <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> theory, the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion model (VSEPR), and the concept of oxidation number can be used to explain molecular structure and composition.|$|E
5000|$|For physisorption, under {{appropriate}} conditions, {{gas phase}} molecules can form multilayer adsorption. In chemisorption, molecules are adsorbed {{on the surface}} by <b>valence</b> <b>bonds</b> and only form monolayer adsorption.|$|R
40|$|We propose {{an order}} {{parameter}} to characterize valence-bond-solid (VBS) states in quantum spin chains, {{given by the}} ground-state expectation value of a unitary operator appearing in the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis argument. We show that the order parameter changes the sign according {{to the number of}} <b>valence</b> <b>bonds</b> (broken <b>valence</b> <b>bonds)</b> at the boundary for periodic (open) systems. This allows us to determine the phase transition point in between different VBS states. We demonstrate this theory in the successive dimerization transitions of the bond-alternating Heisenberg chains, using the quantum Monte Carlo method. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
50|$|Sectility in metals is {{a result}} of {{metallic}} <b>bonding,</b> where <b>valence</b> (<b>bonding)</b> electrons are delocalized and can flow freely between atoms, rather than being shared between specific pairs or groups of atoms, as in covalent bonding.|$|R
25|$|While {{the idea}} of shared {{electron}} pairs provides an effective qualitative picture of covalent bonding, quantum mechanics is needed {{to understand the nature}} of these bonds and predict the structures and properties of simple molecules. Walter Heitler and Fritz London are credited with the first successful quantum mechanical explanation of a chemical bond (molecular hydrogen) in 1927. Their work was based on the <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> model, which assumes that a chemical bond is formed when there is good overlap between the atomic orbitals of participating atoms.|$|E
25|$|In organic chemistry, when a {{molecule}} with a planar ring obeys Hückel's rule, where {{the number of}} π electrons fit the formula 4n+2 (where n is an integer), it attains extra stability and symmetry. In benzene, the prototypical aromatic compound, there are 6 π bonding electrons (n=1, 4n+2=6). These occupy three delocalized π molecular orbitals (molecular orbital theory) or form conjugate π bonds in two resonance structures that linearly combine (<b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> theory), creating a regular hexagon exhibiting a greater stabilization than the hypothetical 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene.|$|E
25|$|The {{atoms in}} {{molecules}} (QTAIM) model of Richard Bader {{was developed to}} effectively link the quantum mechanical model of a molecule, as an electronic wavefunction, to chemically useful concepts such as atoms in molecules, functional groups, bonding, the theory of Lewis pairs, and the <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> model. Bader has demonstrated that these empirically useful chemistry concepts {{can be related to}} the topology of the observable charge density distribution, whether measured or calculated from a quantum mechanical wavefunction. QTAIM analysis of molecular wavefunctions is implemented, for example, in the AIMAll software package.|$|E
5000|$|Walter Heinrich Heitler ( [...] ; 2 January 1904 - 15 November 1981) was a German {{physicist}} {{who made}} contributions to quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theory. He brought chemistry under quantum mechanics through {{his theory of}} <b>valence</b> <b>bonding.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The bonding {{number of}} a {{skeletal}} atom in a parent hydride {{is the sum}} {{of the total number of}} <b>valence</b> <b>bonds</b> to adjacent skeletal atoms, if any, and the number of attached hydrogen atoms. In SH2, for example, S has bonding number 2.|$|R
40|$|We present {{analytical}} and numerical study of discrete breathers identified as localized deformations of valence angles accompanied by change of <b>valence</b> <b>bonds</b> in crystalline polyethylene (PE). It is shown that such breathers can exist inside the optic wave number band and can propagate along the macromolecule chain with subsonic velocities. Analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulation using Molecular Dynamics procedure. We examine also {{stability of the}} breathers relative to thermal excitations and mutual collisions {{as well as to}} collisions with acoustic non-topological and topological solitons. The conditions of breathers existence depend strongly on their generating frequency, relationship between stiffnesses of <b>valence</b> <b>bonds</b> and <b>valence</b> angles as well as on type of nonlinear characteristics of intrachain interactions.

25|$|In {{spite of}} its long history, an {{accurate}} scale of electronegativity was not developed until 1932, when Linus Pauling proposed an electronegativity scale, which depends on bond energies, as a development of <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> theory. It {{has been shown to}} correlate with a number of other chemical properties. Electronegativity cannot be directly measured and must be calculated from other atomic or molecular properties. Several methods of calculation have been proposed, and although there may be small differences in the numerical values of the electronegativity, all methods show the same periodic trends between elements.|$|E
25|$|Unlike benzene, the carbon–carbon {{bonds in}} {{naphthalene}} {{are not of}} the same length. The bonds C1−C2, C3−C4, C5−C6 and C7−C8 are about 1.37 Å (137 pm) in length, whereas the other carbon–carbon bonds are about 1.42 Å (142 pm) long. This difference, established by X-ray diffraction, {{is consistent with the}} <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> model in naphthalene and in particular, with the theorem of cross-conjugation. This theorem would describe naphthalene as an aromatic benzene unit bonded to a diene but not extensively conjugated to it (at least in the ground state). As such, naphthalene possesses several resonance structures.|$|E
25|$|The {{triple bond}} {{is very strong}} with a bond {{strength}} of 839 kJ/mol. The sigma bond contributes 369kJ/mol, the first pi bond contributes 268kJ/mol and the second pi-bond of 202kJ/mol bond strength. Bonding usually discussed {{in the context of}} molecular orbital theory, which recognizes the triple bond as arising from overlap of s and p orbitals. In the language of <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> theory, the carbon atoms in an alkyne bond are sp hybridized: they each have two unhybridized p orbitals and two sp hybrid orbitals. Overlap of an sp orbital from each atom forms one sp–sp sigma bond. Each p orbital on one atom overlaps one on the other atom, forming two pi bonds, giving a total of three bonds. The remaining sp orbital on each atom can form a sigma bond to another atom, for example to hydrogen atoms in the parent acetylene. The two sp orbitals project {{on opposite sides of the}} carbon atom.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} <b>bond</b> <b>valence</b> method (BVM) and its {{application}} in the non-isovalent semiconductor alloy (GaN) _ 1 -x(ZnO) _x. Particular {{attention is paid}} to the role of short-range order (SRO). A physical interpretation based on atomic orbital interaction is proposed and examined by density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Combining BVM with Monte-Carlo simulations and a DFT-based cluster expansion model, bond-length distributions and bond-angle variations are predicted. The correlation between <b>bond</b> <b>valence</b> and <b>bond</b> stiffness is also revealed.

[...] Taube felt that a [...] "primary flaw" [...] with his correlation between electron configuration and ligand substitution was that it was described mainly in terms of <b>valence</b> <b>bond</b> theory, as crystal field theory and ligand field theory were not well established when he published his work in 1952.|$|E
