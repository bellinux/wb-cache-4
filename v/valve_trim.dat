40|$|A {{method is}} {{provided}} for establishing {{a control valve}} trim's throttling exit flow area using readily available information in the technical literature and known process conditions in the fluid flow field. The area at the exit of the throttling trim {{is needed to determine}} the velocity and energy content of the fluid jets leaving the <b>valve</b> <b>trim.</b> The velocity and energy levels of the jets are essential in judging the ability of the valve design to provide good control while minimizing the detrimental affects of cavitation for liquids and noise for gases. Both of these effects can also lead to unwanted vibration of the piping systems. In addition, knowledge of the fluid velocity in the jets can also aid in judgments regarding erosion of valve internal components. The method requires knowledge of the valve’s flow coefficient, the variables used in determining the flow coefficient such as flow rate, pressure drop, fluid density and an estimate of the resistance coefficient for the <b>valve</b> <b>trim.</b> It is this later item that is not readily available from the valve manufacturer; however good estimates {{of the value of the}} resistance coefficient can be made from information available in literature dealing with flows and pressure drops through different geometries.

40|$|This study {{uses the}} {{experimental}} flow test data to validate CFD simulations for a complex control <b>valve</b> <b>trim.</b> In both the simulation and the experimental flow test {{the capacity of}} the trim (Cv) is calculated in order to test the ability of CFD software to provide a design tool for these trims. While CFD tests produced results for the capacity which were consistent across a series of five different simulations, it differed from the experimental flow data by nearly 25 %. This indicates that CFD simulations need to be properly calibrated before being used in designing complex valve trims...|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{control valves}} often handle flows with very high {{pressure}} drops (conditions {{often referred to}} as severe service). In order to cope with such pressure drops, geometrically complex <b>valve</b> <b>trims</b> with many stages of pressure drops, are designed to prevent undesirable side effects such as cavitation etc. There are many different product designs for control <b>valve</b> <b>trims</b> produced by different manufacturers. One such design uses cylindrical obstructions in the flow field to control the pressure drop. The design of these trims is based on their capacity (Cv) values. With the advent of advanced computational tools, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics based codes, it has become possible to numerically test these trims over a wide range of flow conditions. Hence, this study presents capacity testing and local flow analysis of a complex geometry trim, installed within a commercial control valve for severe service. The results show that the capacity of this particular design of trim decreases as the valve opening position decreases...|$|R

40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{manufacturing}} methods used for the manufacture of control <b>valve</b> <b>trim</b> components, some of which are expensive processes. Current market conditions and increased competition requires manufacturers to reduce costs of these components and they are investigating new technologies such as processes using Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) to produce these components.

40|$|As {{part of a}} LINK surface {{engineering}} project, a consortium of universities, hard materials suppliers, valve manufacturers and end users have investigated the incorporation of CVD diamond into choke valves to enhance valve life in erosive duties. Diamond was applied to regions of the <b>valve</b> <b>trim</b> and tested under full scale conditions in a high pressure valve loop test facility and compared with standard uncoated tungsten carbide trims. The valve trims were tested with a 60 bar pressure drop and a flow rate of 7. 5 l s? 1 using water–sand slurry containing 1 % (w/w) solids with a mean diameter of 194 ?m. The results show that valve seats and plugs with a partial coverage of CVD diamond exhibit 50 – 60 % greater resistance to damage caused by sand particle impingement. Moreover, it is felt that further improvements are attainable with subtle improvement of {{the design of the}} trim and coating processes to allow complete coating of critical components with complex design...|$|E
40|$|Safety valves are {{mechanical}} devices {{designed to}} protect a system (typically a pressure vessel) against excessive pressure; the operational behavior of spring loaded safety valves is governed by {{the difference between the}} reclosing force operated by the spring and the opening force operated by the pressure field acting on the opening device surface. The resulting flow path inside the valve body is very complicated due to sharp edges and sudden curvature characterizing the device geometry, and to complex flow phenomena like shock waves and supersonic expansions occurring when operating with compressible flows. As a consequence, the design of safety relief valves is an hard task. In some cases safety relief valves are required to operate with both compressible and incompressible flows, e. g. in shell-type water–gas heat exchangers, but indeed the device behavior may significantly vary when operating with different fluids. Since the valve performance is strongly dependent on the fluid properties, a particular design of the <b>valve</b> <b>trim</b> (i. e. of the flow path) is thus required in order to guarantee proper functional characteristics when the valve is working either with gases or liquids. In this work an accurate Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) solver is applied to compute higher-order approximations of the flow field within a 200 J 300 safety valve (according to API 526) designed for steam–water double protection. The investigation aims at clarifying the role played by viscous losses and compressibility effects in the discharge capability of the device when working with air or water. The main features of the code used for incompressible flows relying on a fully implicit high-order DG discretization of the coupled RANS and k–x turbulence model equations are also described...|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} for simultaneous estimation of multiphase flow rate and stream composition {{has been developed}} to be applied in a multiple restriction assembly composed of two orifice meters and a cage <b>trim</b> <b>valve.</b> These differential pressure elements are typical instrument installed in the wellhead of production wells in Urucu field (Petrobras/Brazil). To deliver composition and rates four steps were done: 1) a multi-rate well test - an experimental procedure carried out in real operation conditions. 2) modeling of multiphase flow expansion process through cage <b>trim</b> <b>valves.</b> 3) performance and validation of multiphase flow through orifice plate meters {{by the use of}} homogeneous and slip models. 4) tuning and metering procedures for coupling the valve and orifice plate models. The last investigation developed a full field production optimization procedure honouring pressure and routing constraints to be applied in multiple wells. Essentially, the research performed in this thesis is an experimental work followed by numerical modeling. Model errors and performance validation were calculated on the basis of measured data from a multi-rate well test. This field scale experiment consisted in a sequential step response test followed by a transient and a steady state period “a priori” to each next step. Three wells named Well 1, Well 2 and Well 3 were single routed to a test separator. Two types of well performance were investigated: 1) production with stream composition variation caused by gas/water coning. 2) production with steady state composition. Eight wellhead variables were monitored: two orifice plate differential pressures, the differential pressure and temperature through the cage valve, the downstream choke pressure, the wellhead pressure and temperature and the gathering system temperature. The field scale experiments generated a database composed by 1781 test points, averaged in 30 minutes interval. Multiphase flow expansion process through cage <b>trim</b> <b>valve</b> is discussed in chapter 2. It represents an enabler investigation to the thesis main objective.

50|$|A ceramic valve is a <b>valve</b> with ceramic <b>trim,</b> ball, seat, disc or lining. A carbon or {{stainless}} steel body is used to protect the ceramic trim from being damaged by sudden thermal or mechanical shock. Advanced ceramics {{are used in the}} manufacture including alumina, zirconia and silicon nitride. Significant benefits of the use of ceramic in valves (when compared to steel or other traditional materials) include resistance to wear and their lower mass. Thanks to the excellent corrosion resistance, abrasive resistance and wear resistance, ceramic valves are often used in severe corrosive and abrasive applications, such as FGD, and pneumatic refuse conveying systems.|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that inlet flow characteristics may affect the performance of fluid handling systems considerably. This work focuses on the local flow analysis of a severe service control valve with a continuous resistance trim (CRT) operating under multiphase flow conditions {{and the effect of}} the inlet flow characteristics on the dispersed phase distribution within the <b>trim</b> and the <b>valve</b> flow coefficient Cv. Three dimensional CFD models, using both the mixture model and turbulence model k-omega SST, were used to simulate the flow within <b>valve</b> body and <b>trim</b> assembly under multiphase conditions.

40|$|Noise {{is one of}} the {{problems}} {{associated with the use of}} any type of control valve in systems involving the flow of fluids. The advent of OSHA standards has prompted control valve manufacturers to design <b>valves</b> with special <b>trim</b> to lower the sound pressure level to meet these standards. However, these levels are in some cases too high, particularly when a valve must be located in or near an area where people are working at tasks requiring a high degree of concentration. Such locations are found around and near research devices and in laboratory-office areas. This paper describes a type of fluid control device presently being used at PPL as a bypass control valve in deionized water systems and designed to reduce sound pressure levels considerably below OSHA standards. Details of the design and construction of this constant pressure drop variable flow control valve are contained in the text and are shown in photographs and drawings. Test data taken are included.

40|$|BackgroundEndovascular {{application}} of pulmonary heart valves has been recently introduced clinically. A tissue-engineering approach was pursued {{to overcome the}} current limitations of bovine jugular vein valves (degeneration and limited longevity). However, deployment of the delicate tissue-engineered valves resulted in severe tissue damage. Therefore {{the objective of this}} study was to prevent tissue damage during the folding and deployment maneuver. Material and MethodsPorcine pulmonary heart valves, small intestinal submucosa, and ovine carotid arteries were obtained from a slaughterhouse. After dissection and antimicrobial incubation, the <b>valves</b> were <b>trimmed</b> (removal of sinus and most of the muscular ring) to fit into the deployment catheter. The inside (in-stent group, n = 6) or outside (out-stent group, n = 6) of a nitinol stent was covered by an acellular small intestinal submucosa, and the valves were sutured into the stent. The valves were folded, tested for placement in the deployment catheter, and decellularized enzymatically. Myofibroblasts were obtained from carotid artery segments and seeded onto the scaffolds. The seeded constructs were placed in a dynamic bioreactor system and cultured for 16 consecutive days. After endothelial cell seeding, the constructs were folded, deployed, and processed for histology and surface electron microscopy. ResultsThe valves opened and closed competently throughout the entire dynamic culture. Surface electron microscopy revealed an almost completely preserved tissue in the in-stent group. Stents covered with small intestinal submucosa on the outside, however, showed severe damage. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that small intestinal submucosa covering of the inside of a pulmonary valved stent can prevent stent strut–related tissue damage...|$|R
40|$|A {{control valve}} that can {{throttle}} high-pressure cryogenic fluid embodies several design features that distinguish it over conventional valves designed for similar applications. Field and design engineers {{worked together to}} create a valve that would simplify installation, trim changes, and maintenance, thus reducing overall cost. The seals and plug stem packing were designed to perform optimally in cryogenic temperature ranges. Unlike conventional high-pressure cryogenic <b>valves,</b> the <b>trim</b> size can be changed independent of the body. The design feature that provides flexibility for changing the trim is a split body. The body is divided into an upper and a lower section with the seat ring sandwiched in between. In order to maintain the plug stem packing at an acceptable sealing temperature during cryogenic service, heat-exchanging fins were added to the upper body section. The body is made of stainless steel. The seat ring is made of a nickel-based alloy having a coefficient of thermal expansion less than that of the body material. Consequently, when the interior of the valve is cooled cryogenically, the body surrounding the seat ring contracts more than the seat ring. This feature prevents external leakage at the body-seat joint. The seat ring has been machined to have small, raised-face sealing surfaces {{on both sides of the}} seal groove. These sealing surfaces concentrate the body bolt load over a small area, thereby preventing external leakage. The design of the body bolt circle is different from that of conventional highpressure control valves. Half of the bolts clamp the split body together from the top, and half from the bottom side. This bolt-circle design allows a short, clean flow path, which minimizes frictional flow losses. This bolt-circle design also makes it possible to shorten the face-toface length of the valve, which is 25. 5 in. (65 cm). In contrast, a conventional, high-pressure control valve face-to-face dimension may be greater than 40 in. (> 1 m) long...|$|R
40|$|Multistage {{severe service}} control valves are {{extensively}} used in various energy systems, {{such as oil}} & gas, nuclear etc. The primary purpose of such valves is to control the amount of fluid flow passing through them under extreme pressure changes. As opposed to the conventional valves (butterfly, gate etc.), control valves are often installed in energy systems with geometrically complex trims, comprising of various geometrical features, formed by a complex arrangement of cylindrical arrays. The pressure within the trim varies in controlled steps and hence, cavitation resistance can be embedded in the trim through improved design process for the trim for severe service applications in energy systems. The flow characteristics within a control valve are quite complex, owing to complex geometrical features inherent in such designs, which makes it extremely difficult to isolate and quantify contribution of these features on the flow characteristics. One {{of the most important}} design parameters of such trims is the flow coefficient (also known as flow capacity) of the trim which depends on the geometrical features of the trim. The design of valves for particular performance envelop within the energy systems depends on effects of complex trim geometrical features on performance characteristics; hence, the focus of recent research is on quantifying the hydrodynamic behaviour of severe service control <b>valves,</b> including the <b>trims.</b> This includes the estimation of the local flow capacity contributions of the geometrical features of the trim through detailed numerical investigations. In this work, a tool has been developed {{that can be used to}} predict the local contribution of geometrical features on the flow coefficient of the trim. It is expected that this work will result in better performance of the energy systems where these valves are used...|$|R
