40|$|The Brazilian Savanna Ecoregion (Cerrado) {{is one of}} {{the richest}} biomes in the world, with a {{characteristic}} highly seasonal climate a dry season between May and September and a rainy season from October through April. Ground-dwelling spiders from three Cerrado phytophysiognomies, "campo cerrado", "cerrado" and "cerrad√£o", were sampled using pitfall traps during two years, totaling 111 species and 3, 529 individuals. The abundance of individuals and species richness was higher during the wet season. Fifty-eight species were captured exclusively during that period, whereas only nineteen were restricted to the dry season. Only two species were found in all samples. The number of juveniles was higher than the number of adults in all phytophysiognomies and in all species during both seasons. The highest abundance was registered in October and the lowest in April. Overall sex ratio was male-biased in all vegetation types sampled. Distinct climate variables affected the abundance of spiders depending on sex, age and <b>vegetal</b> <b>physiognomy</b> where they were sampled. This study involved the longest sampling of spider abundance and diversity on the ground of a Brazilian Savanna...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the spectral response of several vegetation physiognomies in the municipality of Maraba, Para, {{in relation to the}} proportion of vegetation, shadow and soil components derived through the Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM), through the Shadow percent measured in the videographic products and the comparison of the Shadow component with the Shadow percent measured in videography. Based on the videography, five types of vegetation physiognomies were identified: Upland Forest, Floodplain Forest, Secondary forest, Babacu Forest and Grassland. The results demonstrated the percentage of shadow in the videographic data allowed only the differentiation of Babacu Forest from the remaining classes. The Shadow component of the linear mixing model was the most efficient product for the discrimination of the <b>vegetal</b> <b>physiognomies,</b> allowing the discrimination among all the classes but between Grassland and Secondary forest. This result reassures the potential of LSMM to the study of natural vegetation cover in Tropical Forest Regions. Pages: 1399 - 140...|$|R
