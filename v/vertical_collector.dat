Results show that: there are many factors to affect solar chimney ventilation that include heat collection height and width, solar radiation intensity, inlet and outlet area ratio of chimney and air inlet velocity, etc. When the collector height is increased, chimney ventilation is getting higher; but the ventilation increases slowly even decreases; the ventilation increases first and then decreases as the growing of the air layer thickness under the same chimney height and width; there exists an optimal ratio between heat collector height and width which makes the ventilation largest; considering the urban architecture image {{and the influence of}} the air layer thickness on chimney ventilation, the best air layer thickness is between 0. 2 m and 0. 4 m. Besides, the airflow temperature in solar chimney increases with chimney height in certain solar radiation intensity. It is consistent with the theoretical analysis and simulation results...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Wetlands have {{recently}} been used to help filter out nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus, in water to reduce the rates of eutrophication in water bodies. Prairie Wolf Slough is a restored wetland {{that was used to}} showcase this ecosystem service; however, the wetland actually exports more phosphorus from its outlet than it takes in at its inlet. The role that atmospheric phosphorus deposition might play in this wetland’s phosphorus loading was examined in this study using a vertical collecting method and a horizontal collecting method. The spatial and temporal variation of phosphorus deposition was also examined. The methods were both found to collect particulate matter; however, the <b>vertical</b> <b>collector</b> was more efficient at collecting total solids deposition, while the horizontal collector was more efficient at collecting total phosphorus deposition. Rainfall was not found to be a significant indicator of the efficiency of either collector for total phosphorus or total solids deposition collection.

40|$|Bifacial PV {{cells have}} the {{capacity}} to produce solar electricity from both sides and, thus, amongst other advantages, allow a significantly increase both in peak and annual power output while utilizing the same amount of silicone. Ac-cording to the manufacturer, the bifacial cells are around 1. 3 times more expensive than the single-sided cells. This way, bifacial PV cells can effectively reduce the cost of solar power for certain applications. Today, the most common application for these cells is in stationary <b>vertical</b> <b>collectors</b> which are exposed to sunlight from both sides, as the rela-tive position of the sun changes throughout the day. Another possible application is to utilize these cells in concentrat-ing collectors. Three test prototypes utilizing bifacial PV cells were built. The initial two prototypes were built for in-door testing and differed only in geometry of the reflector, one being asymmetric and the other symmetric. Both proto-types were evaluated in an indoor solar simulator. Both reflector designs yielded positive electrical performance results and similar efficiencies {{from both sides of the}} cell were achieved. However, lower fill factor than expected was achieved for both designs when compared to the single cell tests. The results are discussed and suggestions for further testing are presented. A third prototype was built in order to perform outdoor evaluations. This prototype utilized a bi-facial PV cells string laminated in silicone enclosed between 2 standard glass panes and a collector box with an asym-metric CPC concentrator. The prototype peak electrical efficiency and temperature dependence were evaluated. ...|$|R

Solutions were heated up to 50  °C and stirred for 3  h. Then, they were mixed up together and stirred for 48  h at room temperature. The polymer concentration was varied from 1.5 to 4 % (w/v, {{with respect to the}} solvent) and the percentage of added starch changed from 20 to 50 % (w/w, with respect to the polymer concentration). The polymer blend solutions were injected into 1  ml syringe which was fixed horizontally on a syringe pump (model: JMS SP- 500). The flow rate of the solutions was adjusted at 0.1  ml/h. The electrode of the high voltage–power supply (model: Gold Star PZ- 121) was clamped to the metal needle tip and a 15  kV voltage was applied to generate the electrical field. The tip-to-collector distance was adjusted to 20  cm. To spin the solutions, the functional parameters: feed rate, applied voltage, and tip-to-collector distance were verified, and the uniform nanofibers were obtained.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the possibility}} of implementation of combined energy supply systems in individual houses. It reviews the problems and tendencies of heat energy supply to modern housing. The topic of feasibility study of combined energy supply implementation in individual houses has been selected for several reasons. First – as many as 43 % {{of the people in}} Lithuania live in individual houses. Most of such houses were built many years ago; they are equipped with an out-dated and inefficient heat supply system. Second – the paper is relevant for both newly built houses as well as those already built. 	The thesis presents the schemes of combined energy supply taking into account their strengths and weaknesses. The major elements of combined systems were examined. A project of a 200 sq. m. individual residential house, which is characteristic of Lithuanian conditions, was selected for a more thorough analysis. The essential characteristics of the house were defined. A ma-thematical model for a solar collector and geothermal heating was developed. The results of calcula-tion {{in the case of an}} evacuated tube collector and a flat plate collector were compared. The collec-tors were compared by means of the “f” method. An evacuated tube collector was selected with re-gard to the data received and Lithuanian climatic conditions. Horizontal and vertical collectors were compared in the analysis of geothermal heating systems. In the case of a <b>vertical</b> <b>collector,</b> the de-pendence of thermal resistance and heat flux on the operating time was examined; various collector configurations on the basis of correlation coefficients were evaluated. The dependence of heat flow and thermal resistance was also evaluated under the conditions of different heat transfer coefficients, fluid flow velocities and soil types. Implementation recommendations were prepared for the systems under analysis. Economic indicators for an optimal system were calculated. 	The paper is important because it clearly proves that the technologies using renewable energy resources are acceptable and can fully meet the heat demands in individual houses as well as supply a 4 -member family with hot water...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{examples}} of architectural design of converting {{active solar house}} to passive solar house together with some considerations about the consequences are presented. The first one is MIT Solar House IV built in 1957 and the data acquisition was completed in 1961, when the house {{was determined to be}} sold as an ordinary house. The author was engaged in making the conversion design by removing 55 m 2 of solar collector to provide a partial extension of living room with south facing opening for direct solar heat gain. The second one is K Solar House built in 1972 with 16 units of sliding <b>vertical</b> solar <b>collector</b> of 1. 6 m 2 each. These were replaced by glass block wall and sliding insulation panels with a low emissivity glass pane. The wood framings of original collector units were reused and the original aluminium framings for glass as collector glazing cover were unchanged...|$|R
50|$|On the Isle of Man, the Snaefell Mountain Railway's {{implementation}} {{is unusual}} in that the overhead wire is slack and free to hang in a catenary. Hopkinson bow collectors are used, to avoid problems with trolley poles in high winds on the mountainous route - the Snaefell line also uses a Fell rail for braking. Each car has two rigidly <b>vertical</b> bow <b>collectors,</b> with a slack wire above them making contact under its own weight. The collectors are not quite tall enough {{to make contact with}} the wire at its suspension points. They are far enough apart, relative to the pole spacing, so that while one is out of contact with the wire the other is mid span and making good contact. The collectors can only be lowered by unbolting them at roof level, whilst the power is off. This inability to isolate them easily hampered fire fighting when car 5 caught fire in 1970.|$|R

40|$|There is a growing, government-led {{trend of}} {{applying}} renewable energy in Hong Kong. One {{area of interest}} lies in the wider use of solar-energy systems. The worldwide fast development of building-integrated solar technology has prompted the design alternative of fixing the solar panels on the external façades of buildings. In Hong Kong, high-rise buildings are found everywhere in the urban districts. How to make full use of the vertical facades of these buildings to capture the most solar radiation {{can be an important}} area in the technology promotion. In this numerical study, the potential application of a centralized solar water-heating system in high-rise residence was evaluated. Arrays of solar thermal collectors, that occupied the top two-third of the south and west façades of a hypothetical high-rise residence, were proposed for supporting the domestic hot-water system. Based on typical meteorological data, {{it was found that the}} annual efficiency of the <b>vertical</b> solar <b>collectors</b> could reach 38. 4 % on average, giving a solar fraction of 53. 4 % and a payback period of 9. 2 years. Since the solar collectors were able to reduce the heat transmission through the building envelope, the payback was in fact even shorter if the energy saving in air-conditioner operation was considered.

40|$|The {{evaluated}} {{solar thermal}} collector provides half of the energy needed for a household’s domestic hot water. It is a simple low cost energy solution that many regular households can use. The solar thermal system is for sale and government backing is provided in Norway. The experiments were conducted at the Solar Laboratory, University of Oslo in July to October 2012. The system included a 4. 2 m 2 <b>vertical</b> solar <b>collector</b> and a 0, 3 m 3 hot water tank and monitoring equipment. The system was designed to meet half of the annual total tap water demand (4800 kWh). The storage tank was emptied each day to simulate domestic hot water consumption. All days in August and September 2012 {{were included in the}} analyses. Good correlation was found with the solar radiation, though it was a summer with lower solar radiation than a normal year. In order to evaluate the system for a typical year values from MET Norway were used. The solar collector yield was 366 kWh/m 2, year if the solar collector was used March to October. These results mean that a collector area of 6. 6 m 2 is required to produce 2400 kWh per year. By improving the collector and by using “Solar Glass” and also harvest heat during the winter the collector area could be reduce to 5. 4 m 2.

40|$|Natural {{convection}} losses {{between an}} absorber plate and the cover glazing for different gap sizes and at different plate temperatures have been predicted theoretically by various empirical correlations developed by McAdams, 4 Mikheyev, 3 Tabor, 5 Buchberg et al. 6 and Hollands et al. 7 The free convection heat transfer coefficients {{have been evaluated}} for horizontal, <b>vertical</b> and tilted <b>collectors.</b> The natural convection coefficient decreases and the shading due to side walls increases with increase in gap size. Therefore, the shade correction factor has also been calculated for different collector inclinations for low and medium latitude stations. By taking into consideration both these factors [...] that is, convection losses and shading [...] the air gap between the absorber plate and the cover glazing has been optimised. It has been found that, for minimum shading and minimum convection losses, a gap of 4 to 5 cm should be maintained between the absorber plate and the cover glazing in typical flat-plate solar energy collectors. ...|$|R
40|$|Transparent {{insulation}} materials (TIM) can extremely improve collector systems {{with respect to}} both system performance and simplification.

An anti-freeze loop with heat exchanger is not necessary. This was proofed with the first two ICS prototypes during an extreme cold period with little insolation (January 1987) in Freiburg, FRG. Improved prototypes with reflector reached a yearly solar fraction of 65 % and an efficiency of 32 % (4 square meter absorber area, 160 liters of water at 45 degree C per day, 10 degree C cold water inlet temperature and slope of 45 degree, south oriented).

40|$|Abstract: In this work, shading {{effect and}} optimal tilt-angle of {{collectors}} in an array was investigated {{based on the}} mathematical method developed. Results show that the distance between collectors in two adjacent raws (D) has {{a significant effect on}} the annual collectible radiation, and the ratio of top <b>vertical</b> height of <b>collectors</b> (H) measuring from the ground to D should be larger than tan(23. 45 +λ). Results also indicate that, the optimal tilt angle of collectors is related to site latitude (λ), climatic conditions in sites, reflectivity of the ground (ρ) as well its position in the collector array, for the case of ρ = 0. 2, the optimal tilt-angle of south-facing collectors in the first raw, opt, 1 β, is close to the site latitude for most of areas in China except areas with poor solar resources, and the optimal tilt-angle of collectors in other place is about 4 - 5 o lower than opt, 1 β; whereas for the case of ρ = 0, the optimal tilt-angle of all collectors in the array is almost identical and about 7 - 8 o lower than the site latitude for most areas in China. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe ThermoMap project ([URL] is an EC co-funded project (FP 7 -ICT Policy Support Programme) {{and focuses}} on mapping very shallow {{geothermal}} energy potentials (vSGP) in Europe. Geothermal energy, as defined in the directive on renewable energy sources from 2009, is {{energy in the form}} of heat beneath the Earth's surface. Horizontal and vertical heat exchangers and other very shallow heat exchange systems including ground source heat pumps (GSHP) are effective devices to exploit the energy of the shallow underground. The key objective of the project is to provide an appropriate visualisation of the estimated very shallow geothermal energy potential by using a specially developed open-source web mapping (WebGIS) application running in a web browser on the Internet. ThermoMap collects, harmonises, combines, analyses and validates available pedological, climatological, topographical, geological, groundwater and administrative (meta-) data to estimate the shallow geothermal energy potential at depths up to ten metres below surface. A multitude of further background information on a medium scale (European Outline Map) to regional and local scale (14 Test Areas) across Europe has been derived. The results show variations of temperature and heat flow at depths up to ten metres. These variations are controlled by internal soil properties like texture, moisture, pore size distribution (characteristic air and water balance) and bulk density as well as climatic conditions (temperature, precipitation) and hydro-/geological parameters (groundwater level, saturation conditions). Using the approach and formulas according to Kersten (1949) and Dehner (2007) geothermal energy potentials have been calculated with a resulting spatial dataset of heat conductivity values in W/(m*K) and volumetric heat capacity in MJ/(m 3 *K). The GIS pre-processing takes into account parameters such as legal constraints, slope and unsuitable soil types as well as the availability of the softrock zone required for the efficient installation and operation of different horizontal and <b>vertical</b> heat <b>collector</b> systems. One main output of the project work is a WebGIS-based open-source mapping application named ThermoMap MapViewer ([URL] The contained visualised geodata consists of the technically and semantically harmonised, processed and analysed datasets from each case study area. No spatial analysis is performed by the web mapping application, it acts as a central portal visualising pre-processed GIS results collected from distributed databases via Web Map Services from each project country partner. For end-users of the developed estimation system, four possible target groups have been identified: research, industry, public and public agencies. The different target groups are invited to use the WebGIS interface according to their different needs. In tailoring the demands and needs of the end-users, graduated information levels within the MapViewer application were developed. These are represented by different 'Info Tools' allowing for differing levels of focus, content, terminology, data volume and information scope. For the general end-user a special query tool was created that displays interpreted information which can also be downloaded as PDF-file or printed as a 'Location Information Sheet' enriched with map details, diagrams and tables. To ensure a continual validation and improving of the ThermoMap R&D outcomes, a testing phase in the form of user seminars has been performed and evaluated. Additionally, modelling results have been cross-validated with field measurements and laboratory analyses of key characteristics such as soil texture, bulk density, and heat conductivity. The appropriate evaluation of both activities will create not only valuable feedback for an enhancement of the user-friendliness of the WebGIS service, but also provides the consortium with comparable measured data to be able to validate the developed process concept as well as to improve the accuracy of the ThermoMap estimation system for the very shallow geothermal potential (vSGP) across Europe...|$|R
