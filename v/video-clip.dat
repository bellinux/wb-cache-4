2500|$|In early rounds, team captains would 'pick a packet' (a {{numbered}} pack of ten questions) from a {{board of}} numbered options. [...] Teams could answer these questions with no penalties for incorrect answers but each round was time limited and teams would 'pass' difficult questions to attempt remaining questions before returning to passed questions. [...] All team members could respond to questions; in cases where two answers were given at the same time, the host would ask the captain to confirm the team's response. A 'beat the buzzer' segment and later a <b>video-clip</b> round completed the contest. In 'beat the buzzer', penalties applied for incorrectly anwered questions. In cases of ties, captains would pick tie-breaker packets for their team to answer.|$|E
2500|$|Dragon's 1984 album Body and the Beat {{became one}} of the biggest-selling albums in Australia and New Zealand; they were {{restored}} to something close to their late 1970s glory. Their public profile was further raised by Marc Hunter's solo album, Communication. Its title track became a moderate hit in Australia and featured a loosely cabaret-oriented <b>video-clip</b> filmed in Amsterdam in which Marc — resplendent in a bright red cowboy hat — was flanked by two women who also danced away under red Stetsons. Body and the Beat yielded further successful Australasian singles, notably [...] "Magic" [...] and [...] "Cry", but the 'new' Dragon and the ascendancy of the Hunter-Piggot team also marked the rapidly declining influence of the band's former songwriting powerhouse, Paul Hewson, who only managed one co-writing credit on the album. Mansfield and New Zealand-born singer-songwriter Sharon O'Neill met on Dragon's Body And The Beat tour: they later became domestic and professional partners.|$|E

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} perception of visible speech. Experiment 1 addressed {{the perception of}} speech rate. Observers were shown <b>video-clips</b> of the lower face of actors speaking at their spontaneous rate. Then, they were shown muted versions of the <b>video-clips,</b> which were either accelerated or decelerated. The task (scaling) was to compare visually the speech rate of the stimulus to the spontaneous rate of the actor being shown. Rate estimates were accurate when the <b>video-clips</b> were shown in the normal direction (forward mode). In contrast, speech rate was underestimated when the <b>video-clips</b> were shown in reverse (backward mode). Experiments 2 - 4 (2 AFC) investigated how accurately one discriminates forward and backward speech movements. Unlike in Experiment 1, observers were never exposed to the sound track of the <b>video-clips.</b> Performance was well above chance when playback mode was crossed with rate modulation, {{and the number of}} repetitions of the stimuli allowed some amount of speechreading to take place in forward mode (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, speechreading was made much more difficult by using a different and larger set of muted <b>video-clips.</b> Yet, accuracy decreased only slightly with respect to Experiment 2. Thus, kinematic rather then speechreading cues are most important for discriminating movement direction. Performance worsened, but remained above chance level when the same stimuli of Experiment 3 were rotated upside down (Experiment 4). We argue that the results are in keeping with the hypothesis that visual perception taps into implicit motor competence. Thus, lawful instances of biological movements (forward stimuli) are processed differently from backward stimuli representing movements that the observer cannot perform...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the release}} of <b>video-clip</b> for the single [...] "Just Can't Get Enough" [...] in early 2011, the group spent a short film to the whole country of Japan as that country had been {{recently}} hit by an earthquake and the group filmed the video {{a week before the}} disaster in the country. In July 2011, the Black Eyed Peas founded a school for New York teenagers where students of 13–19 years can learn video production and music using professional equipment.The Peapod Foundation, in collaboration with the Adobe Foundation, opened the music academy and media Peapod Adobe Youth Voices in Manhattan on July 19. The school will have its facilities in a building operated by the Urban Arts Partnership, which provides art-school programs for adolescents studying in areas of very low income. Young people will be admitted according to the recommendations of their teachers and their expressions of interest in the subjects taught, such as camera work, editing and graphic design. On September 3, 2011, the group performed a concert in Minot, North Dakota to benefit the victims of the 2011 Souris River flood that damaged over 4,000 homes and displaced over 12,000 people in Minot and along the Souris River. Fergie is married to Minot native, Josh Duhamel. On September 30, 2011 the group performed a free concert, [...] "Chase Presents The Black Eyed Peas and Friends", for over 50,000 people in New York City's Central Park. The event raised over $4million for the charity.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{spent much}} of 2005 in the studio in Glasgow working on their {{follow-up}} album, You Could Have It So Much Better, which was released on 3 October 2005. The band initially intended to leave the album self-titled like their debut, but they changed it to You Could Have It So Much Better...With Franz Ferdinand before settling on the final title. The album's cover design was modelled on Alexander Rodchenko's 1924 portrait of Lilya Brik. The band attempted to broaden its musical range on the album; Hardy said, [...] "There's {{more to life than}} disco-beat guitar music". It was generally well received in the press and seen as an album equal to, or better than, their first by most critics. It entered the UK Album Charts at Number 1 and the US charts at Number 8. The album eventually sold 2 million copies worldwide. To support the album, four singles were released. Included in that set is a double A-side single that contained a video-clip-only single as well (both the AA-side [...] "L. Wells" [...] and the <b>video-clip</b> [...] "Jeremy Fraser" [...] are not featured on the album, recorded in early 2006 during the band's tour of Australia in support of the album). Also included is another video-clip-only single called [...] "Wine, In the Afternoon" [...] which is the B-side to [...] "Eleanor Put Your Boots On", and was also not featured on the album, but recorded on tour in Michigan. [...] "Do You Want To" [...] made it to number 4 and was declared by Q to be the greatest single of 2005, while [...] "Walk Away" [...] and [...] "The Fallen" [...] entered the top 15 of the UK Singles Chart. The fourth and final single from the second album, [...] "Eleanor Put Your Boots On", peaked at number 30. You Could Have It So Much Better went on to earn a nomination for Best Alternative Album at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in 2006, as did [...] "Do You Want To" [...] for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Three {{experiments}} used Johansson’s [Perception and Psychophysics, 14, 201 – 211 (1973) ] point-light {{technique to}} investigate, whether observers could correctly recognize others from their natural and deceptive walking styles {{based solely on}} the kinematic pattern produced when walking. Participants watched pairs of <b>video-clips</b> of unknown young male actors and judged whether the <b>video-clips</b> in each pair were from the same actor or not. The pairs of <b>video-clips</b> con-sisted of one clip of an actor walking naturally across a room and one clip of an actor attempting to walk deceptively (attempting to make themselves appear con-siderably older than they actually were). The results from Experiments 1 a and 1 b demonstrated that participants were fairly accurate at recognizing when the actors in the two <b>video-clips</b> were the same and when they were different. In addition, an invariant of walking style (weight shift) was shown to be an important kine-matic feature for the identification of walkers. Experiment 2 demonstrated that those walkers whose weight shift differed between their natural and their decep-tive walk were more effective in deceiving observers about their true identity tha...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} study {{designed}} {{to examine how}} knowledge {{of the effects of}} gravity may change the temporal processing of audiovisual events. Specifically, normally-oriented and inverted audiovisual <b>video-clips</b> of different objects being dropped were presented at a range of different stimulus onset asynchronies. Participants made temporal order judgments regarding whether the auditory/visual stream appeared to have been presented first. The results revealed that inverting the visual-display of the falling object led to a significant difference in participant's ability to judge the temporal order of the auditory/ visual components of the desynchronized <b>video-clips.</b> That is, participants were more sensitive to audiovisual asynchrony when viewing normally-oriented <b>video-clips</b> of the falling object as compared to viewing the same clips inverted. These results demonstrate that people's understanding of the effects of gravity on object movement can affect their temporal sensitivity when violations of the fundamental physical parameters determining the movement of real objects are introduced. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
