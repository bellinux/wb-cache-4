The Assembly, with perfect consistency, it must be owned, is engaged in a respectable deliberation how far it is bound by the treaties made with other nations under the former government; and their committee is to report which of them they ought to ratify, and which not. By this means they have put the external fidelity of this <b>virgin</b> <b>state</b> on a par with its internal.|$|E
60|$|Lady Selina {{was shocked}} by such feminine, girlish weakness, such want of dignity and character, such forgetfulness, as she said to Fanny, of what was due to her own position. Lady Selina was herself unmarried, and not likely to marry; and why had she {{maintained}} her <b>virgin</b> <b>state,</b> and foregone the blessings of love and matrimony? Because, as she often said to herself, and occasionally said to Fanny, she would not step down from the lofty pedestal on which it had pleased fortune and birth to place her.|$|E
6000|$|It {{is to be}} {{understood}} that Pinkerton had been, in a sense, pressing me {{to come from the}} beginning; depicting his isolation among new acquaintances, [...] "who have none of them your culture," [...] he wrote; expressing his friendship in terms so warm that it sometimes embarrassed me to think how poorly I could echo them; dwelling upon his need for assistance; and the next moment turning about to commend my resolution and press me to remain in Paris. [...] "Only remember, Loudon," [...] he would write, [...] "if you ever do tire of it, there's plenty of work here for you--honest, hard, well-paid work, developing the resources of this practically <b>virgin</b> <b>State.</b> And, of course, I needn't say what a pleasure it would be to me if we were going at it shoulder to shoulder." [...] I marvel, looking back, that I could so long have resisted these appeals, and continue to sink my friend's money in a manner that I knew him to dislike. At least, when I did awake to any sense of my position, I awoke to it entirely, and determined not only to follow his counsel for the future, but, even as regards the past, to rectify his losses. For in this juncture of affairs I called to mind that I was not without a possible resource, and resolved, at whatever cost of mortification, to beard the Loudon family in their historic city.|$|E

This land is where the [...] "Baypoint" [...] neighborhood is now located. Much of the area fronting the bay was naturally wooded, and here Deering created an arboretum and sanctuary for birds and animals. There were no public roadways in the area east of the railroad, and since Deering strongly opposed the opening of such streets, the area was preserved in its pristine, <b>virgin</b> <b>state</b> for many years.|$|E

50|$|The Cecil series {{developed}} over igneous rock such as granite, and metamorphic rock which is chemically similar to granite. Virgin Cecil soils support forests dominated by pine, oak and hickory, {{and have a}} topsoil of brown sandy loam. The subsoil is a red clay which is dominated by kaolinite and has considerable mica. Few Cecil soils are in their <b>virgin</b> <b>state,</b> for most have been cultivated {{at one time or}} another. Indifferent land management has allowed many areas of Cecil soils to lose their topsoils through soil erosion, exposing the red clay subsoil. This clay is amenable to cultivation, responds well to careful management, and supports good growth of pine where allowed to revert to forest. Like other well-drained Ultisols, it is ideal for urban development; however, in common with other kaolinite-dominated clays, it has little ability to recover from soil compaction. Total potassium in the Cecil is higher than typical for Ultisols due to the presence of mica.|$|E
5000|$|Augustine's [...] "On the Good of Marriage" [...] {{was written}} against {{somewhat}} that still {{remained of the}} heresy of Jovinian. He mentions this error in b. ii. c. 23, de Nuptiis et Conc. Jovinianus, he says, who a few years since tried to found a new heresy, said that the Catholics favored the ManichÃ¦ans, because in opposition to him they preferred holy Virginity to Marriage. [...] "That heresy took its rise from one Jovinianus, a monk, in our own time, when we were yet young". And he adds that it was soon overborne and extinguished, say about A.D. 390, having been condemned first at Rome, then at Milan. There are letters of Pope Siricius on the subject to the Church of Milan, and the answer sent him by the Synod of Milan, at which St. Ambrose presided. Jerome had refuted Jovinian, but {{was said to have}} attempted the defense of the excellency of the <b>virgin</b> <b>state,</b> at the expense of condemning marriage.|$|E

50|$|While {{one source}} {{considers}} the Normanby River system {{as the third}} largest river in Australia, the Australian Government agency, Geoscience Australia, does not assess the Normanby River system within the ten longest rivers in Australia nor within the three longest continuous river systems in the country. The river may be the largest river flowing into the Coral Sea. The Normanby River system has {{less than half the}} flow of the Murray and Mitchell Rivers - though data regarding its flow are sparse with {{less than a third of}} the 24408 km2 catchment area gauged. Together with the Laura River, the Normanby River system is the fourth largest river system in the Great Barrier Reef catchment, with the third largest mean annual discharge into the Reef. Consequently almost all scientific research into the flow and hydrology of the Normanby basin has been done with the health of the reef rather than the river per se in mind. The fact that the Normanby is completely free of dams means that Australian Government studies have used it as a model for the behaviour of rivers further south when they were in something closer to a <b>virgin</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
50|$|This part opens as the High Priestess Ana {{sends the}} Druid bard Taliesin to escort her third daughter, Viviane, to Avalon. Viviane had been fostered on a farm, {{but when she}} is {{fourteen}} years old, her mother recalls her to Avalon {{to take the place}} of her two older sisters, who had died. Since Viviane's strong temperament is similar to her mother's, the two often clash. Viviane completes her training as a priestess, but Ana refuses to allow her initiation, forcing Viviane to remain a noviceâ€”and a virginâ€”for much longer than usual. Although Viviane chafes at what she considers to be an unjust restriction, her <b>virgin</b> <b>state</b> enables her to become the first woman in centuries to handle the Holy Grail, which is kept by Taliesin's order of Druids. Finally, Viviane is initiated when she becomes the lover of the British chief Vortimer. When Vortimer dies, Viviane returns to Avalon carrying his child, a daughter who lives only three months. Meanwhile, Ana has become pregnant, but is too old to give birth safely. She and Viviane forgive each other as they await the birth. Ana dies in childbirth, but the baby, Morgause, survives. Viviane, whose breasts are still producing milk, becomes wet-nurse and foster-mother to her half-sister.|$|E
