5|$|Beetles' flight {{wings are}} crossed with <b>veins</b> <b>and</b> are folded after landing, often along these <b>veins,</b> <b>and</b> stored below the elytra. A fold (jugum) of the {{membrane}} {{at the base}} of each wing is characteristic. Some beetles have lost the ability to fly. These include some ground beetles (Carabidae) and some true weevils (Curculionidae), as well as desert- and cave-dwelling species of other families. Many have the two elytra fused together, forming a solid shield over the abdomen. In a few families, both the ability to fly and the elytra have been lost, as in the glow-worms (Phengodidae), where the females resemble larvae throughout their lives. The presence of elytra and wings does not always indicate that the beetle will fly. For example, the tansy beetle walks between habitats despite being physically capable of flight.|$|E

5|$|Extending {{the work}} of Vesalius into {{experiments}} on still living bodies (of both humans and animals), William Harvey and other natural philosophers investigated the roles of blood, <b>veins</b> <b>and</b> arteries. Harvey's De motu cordis in 1628 {{was the beginning of}} the end for Galenic theory, and alongside Santorio Santorio's studies of metabolism, it served as an influential model of quantitative approaches to physiology.|$|E
5|$|Heart tissue, {{like all}} {{cells in the}} body, needs to be {{supplied}} with oxygen, nutrients {{and a way of}} removing metabolic wastes. This is achieved by the coronary circulation, which includes arteries, <b>veins,</b> <b>and</b> lymphatic vessels. Blood flow through the coronary vessels occurs in peaks and troughs relating to the heart muscle's relaxation or contraction.|$|E
5|$|Limestone is {{the most}} {{important}} mineral quarried, mainly for roads and cement; shale is extracted for cement at Hope, and several gritstone quarries are worked for building stone. Lead mining is no longer economic, but fluorite, baryte and calcite are extracted from lead <b>veins,</b> <b>and</b> small-scale Blue John mining occurs at Castleton.|$|E

5|$|The German {{psychologist}} Adolf Zeising (1810â€“1876) {{claimed that}} the golden ratio was expressed in the arrangement of plant parts, in the skeletons of animals and the branching patterns of their <b>veins</b> <b>and</b> nerves, {{as well as in}} the geometry of crystals.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{also serve}} a {{protective}} role. Several blood-borne substances, {{such as a}} few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are excreted through the lungs. Drugs and other substances can be absorbed, modified or excreted in the lungs. The lungs filter out small blood clots from <b>veins</b> <b>and</b> prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.|$|E
5|$|After Theophrastus, though {{interest}} in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly. It is {{not until the}} age of Alexandria under the Ptolemies that advances in biology resumed. The first medical teacher at Alexandria, Herophilus of Chalcedon, corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between <b>veins</b> <b>and</b> arteries, noting that the latter pulse while the former do not.|$|E
50|$|In female, {{wings are}} normal shape. Fore wings with <b>vein</b> 3 <b>and</b> 4 stalked <b>and</b> <b>vein</b> 5 absent. Vein 6 below angle of cell <b>and</b> <b>veins</b> 7 to 9 stalked. Vein 11 anastomosing with vein 12. Hind wings with <b>veins</b> 4 <b>and</b> 5 absent <b>and</b> <b>veins</b> 6 <b>and</b> 7 stalked.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{essentially}} a conservation of mass equation which balances the renal inputs (the renal artery) and the renal outputs (the renal <b>vein</b> <b>and</b> ureter). Put simply, a non-metabolizable solute entering the kidney via the renal artery has two points of exit, the renal <b>vein</b> <b>and</b> the ureter. The mass entering through the artery per unit time must equal the mass exiting through the <b>vein</b> <b>and</b> ureter per unit time: ...|$|R

5|$|As a first {{approximation}} {{only the}} inert gasses {{are taken into}} account. For oxygen partial pressures above 2.4 bar, the quantity of oxygen dissolved in the arterial blood exceeds the amount that the body can use, and the hemoglobin is saturated with oxygen in both the <b>veins</b> <b>and</b> the arteries. If more oxygen is added, the partial pressure of oxygen in the venous blood rises.|$|E
5|$|As in all arthropods, the chelicerate {{body has}} a very small coelom {{restricted}} to small areas round the reproductive and excretory systems. The main body cavity is a hemocoel that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows, driven by a tubular heart that collects blood from the rear and pumps it forward. Although arteries direct the blood to specific parts of the body, they have open ends rather than joining directly to <b>veins,</b> <b>and</b> chelicerates therefore have open circulatory systems as is typical for arthropods.|$|E
5|$|Attention will {{be focused}} on the {{direction}} of the blood flow in both of the venous systems, and in the perforator veins, as well as being focused on shunt detection. A shunting of blood from the thigh veins back into the lower leg veins will give a reflux situation. The veins most often found to be incompetent are the saphenous <b>veins</b> <b>and</b> the perforators communicating with the deep veins of the thigh.|$|E
50|$|The thoracoepigastric vein {{runs along}} the lateral aspect of the trunk between the {{superficial}} epigastric <b>vein</b> below <b>and</b> the lateral thoracic <b>vein</b> above <b>and</b> establishes an important communication between the femoral <b>vein</b> <b>and</b> the axillary <b>vein.</b>|$|R
50|$|Palpi slight and porrect. Antennae of male {{thickened}} and flattened, {{of female}} simple. Fore wings broad, <b>veins</b> 3 <b>and</b> 4 stalked, <b>and</b> <b>veins</b> 6,7 stalked. <b>Veins</b> 10 <b>and</b> 11 present. Hind wings with an angled tail at <b>vein</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>veins</b> 3,4 stalked.|$|R
50|$|The pectineus is in {{relation}} by its anterior surface with the pubic {{portion of the}} fascia lata, which separates it from the femoral artery <b>and</b> <b>vein</b> <b>and</b> internal saphenous <b>vein,</b> <b>and</b> lower down with the profunda artery.|$|R
5|$|The body {{is divided}} into a thorax of three {{segments}} and a ten-segmented abdomen. The external surface has a tough exoskeleton which contains calcium carbonate and protects the inner organs and provides attachment to muscles. It is coated with wax to repel water. The wings {{are attached to the}} second and third thoracic segments. The tegmina, or first pair of wings, are tough and protective, lying as a shield on top of the membranous hind wings, which are used in flight. All four wings have branching longitudinal <b>veins,</b> <b>and</b> multiple cross-veins.|$|E
5|$|The first {{description}} of thrombosis of the cerebral <b>veins</b> <b>and</b> sinuses {{is attributed to}} the French physician Ribes, who in 1825 observed thrombosis of the saggital sinus and cerebral veins in {{a man who had}} suffered from seizures and delirium. Until {{the second half of the}} 20th century it remained a diagnosis generally made after death. In the 1940s, reports by Dr Charles Symonds and others allowed for the clinical diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis, using characteristic signs and symptoms and results of lumbar puncture.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} the heart is called the endocardium. It {{is made up of}} a lining of simple squamous epithelium, and covers heart chambers and valves. It is continuous with the endothelium of the <b>veins</b> <b>and</b> arteries of the heart, and is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue. The endocardium, by secreting endothelins, may also play a role in regulating the contraction of the myocardium.|$|E
5000|$|It {{begins on}} the side and vertex of the skull in a plexus which {{communicates}} with the frontal <b>vein</b> <b>and</b> supraorbital <b>vein,</b> with the corresponding vein of the opposite side, and with the posterior auricular <b>vein</b> <b>and</b> occipital <b>vein.</b>|$|R
50|$|The palpi are upturned, {{smoothly}} scaled, {{and hardly}} reaching vertex of the head. Maxillary palpi minute. Frons rounded. Antennae of male bipectinate. Tibia with nearly equal spurs. Forewings short <b>and</b> rounded. <b>Vein</b> 3 from near angle of cell <b>and</b> <b>veins</b> 4 <b>and</b> 5 from angle. Vein 7 well separated from <b>veins</b> 8 <b>and</b> 9. <b>Veins</b> 10 <b>and</b> 11 free.

50|$|By its {{anterior}} surface the adductor magnus is {{in relation}} with the pectineus, adductor brevis, adductor longus, femoral artery <b>and</b> <b>vein,</b> profunda artery <b>and</b> <b>vein,</b> with their branches, and with the posterior branches of the obturator artery, obturator <b>vein</b> <b>and</b> obturator nerve.|$|R
5|$|The {{systemic}} {{heart has}} muscular contractile walls {{and consists of}} a single ventricle and two atria, one for {{each side of the}} body. The blood vessels consist of arteries, capillaries and <b>veins</b> <b>and</b> are lined with a cellular endothelium which is quite unlike that of most other invertebrates. The blood circulates through the aorta and capillary system, to the vena cavae, after which the blood is pumped through the gills by the auxiliary hearts and back to the main heart. Much of the venous system is contractile, which helps circulate the blood.|$|E
5|$|The {{thoracic}} duct, which drains {{the majority}} of the body's lymph, passes behind the esophagus, curving from lying behind the esophagus on the right in {{the lower part of the}} esophagus, to lying behind the esophagus on the left in the upper esophagus. The esophagus also lies in front of parts of the hemiazygos <b>veins</b> <b>and</b> the intercostal veins on the right side. The vagus nerve divides and covers the esophagus in a plexus.|$|E
5|$|The {{wings are}} {{transparent}} with black or brown <b>veins</b> <b>and</b> a brown-black patch {{at the base}} of apical cells 2 and 3. These patches are sometimes fused into a continuous zigzag of dark brown to black discolouration. The basal cell is often opaque and amber-coloured. As on many insects, the wing membranes are coated on either side by a repeating pattern of cuticular nanostructures, about 200nm in height, separated by about 180nm. These are thought to aid in anti-reflective camouflage, anti-wetting and self-cleaning.|$|E

50|$|The dorsal venous arch of {{the foot}} is a {{superficial}} vein that connects the small saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>and</b> the great saphenous vein. Anatomically, it is defined by where the dorsal veins of the first and fifth digit, respectively, meet the great saphenous <b>vein</b> <b>and</b> small saphenous <b>vein.</b>|$|R
50|$|The pterygoid plexus of veins {{becomes the}} maxillary vein. The maxillary <b>vein</b> <b>and</b> the {{superficial}} temporal vein later join {{to become the}} retromandibular vein. The posterior branch of the retromandibular <b>vein</b> <b>and</b> posterior auricular <b>vein</b> then form the external jugular vein, which empties into the subclavian vein.|$|R
