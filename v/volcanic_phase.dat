25|$|Little {{is known}} about the eruptive history of Heart Peaks because it has not been studied in detail by scientists. The exact age of Heart Peaks is not known, but its first <b>volcanic</b> <b>phase</b> {{occurred}} during the Neogene period (between 23and 2.5million years ago). The variety of volcanic deposits at Heart Peaks indicates that it has a history of producing not only fluid and passive basaltic lava flows, but also more silica-rich trachyte and rhyolitic lavas and explosive eruptions. Phreatic breccias are found at the volcano, providing evidence that phreatic eruptions have occurred at least once throughout its eruptive history. Features created by subglacial eruptions are also present. The latest <b>volcanic</b> <b>phase</b> at Heart Peaks is largely Pleistocene (between 2.5million and 10,000years ago) in age and late-stage Holocene (10,000years ago to present) activity is uncertain. This is partly because it is unknown whether Holocene volcanic rocks exist at the volcano. Nevertheless, the last eruption at Heart Peaks is unknown.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{evidence}} of a decline in volcanic activity {{over the past few}} million years. This decline in volcanic activity can be grouped into two phases. From eight to four million years ago, volcanism rates were higher than they are at present. Magma production during this <b>volcanic</b> <b>phase</b> was most active from seven to five million years ago and was related to a period of rifting along the Pacific and North American Plate boundary. Between four and three million years ago in the Pliocene epoch, a pause in volcanic activity began to happen. The most recent magmatic phase ranging from two million years ago to present resulted from nearby areas of rifting during a period of compression between the Pacific and North American plates. Volcanism rates during this <b>volcanic</b> <b>phase</b> was most active from two to one million years ago with the construction of 25nbsp&volcanic zones then decreased one million years ago with the construction of 11nbsp&volcanic zones. To date, the most recent <b>volcanic</b> <b>phase</b> has produced [...] of volcanic material whereas the first phase produced [...] of volcanic material. Even though the rate in volcanism throughout the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province has changed considerably, there is no correlation between the rate in magma production and the number of active volcanoes during any interval of time. The present day volcanism rate for the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province is considerably lower than the Cascade Volcanic Arc and Hawaiian volcanism rates. However, geologists are aware the temporal volcanic patterns known for the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province should be looked at carefully because volcanics that pre-date the last glacial period have been eroded by glacial ice and many of the volcanics have not been directly dated or have not been dated in significant detail to identify more individual temporal patterns. Lava fountains can occur in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province roughly every 100nbsp&years.|$|E

2500|$|Silverthrone Caldera is {{the largest}} and best-preserved of the two caldera {{complexes}} in the northern Garibaldi chain, the other being the Franklin Glacier complex [...] to the east-southeast. The caldera has a diameter of [...] and contains breccia, lava flows and lava domes. Like Franklin to the east-southeast, the geology of Silverthrone is poorly known due to minimal studies. The region surrounding the Silverthrone complex is significantly jagged due to the mountainous terrain of the Coast Mountains. Near vertical flanks extend from near sea level to more than [...] in elevation. Silverthrone is significantly younger than the Franklin Glacier complex to the east-southeast and its volcanics likely have ages comparable to other volcanics throughout the Garibaldi chain. The oldest volcanics at the Silverthrone Caldera complex are composed of volcanic breccias, some of which became fused together by intense volcanic heat from when the deposits were first erupted. After these volcanics were deposited, a series of dacite, andesite and rhyolite lava flows were erupted upon volcanic breccia from the first <b>volcanic</b> <b>phase.</b> These eroded lava flows in total are [...] thick. Volcanics in the lower portion of this series of lava flows give a potassium-argon date of 750,000years while volcanics slightly above the lava flows are 400,000years old. The most recent volcanic activity produced a series of andesite and basaltic andesite lava flows down Pashleth Creek and the Machmell and Kingcome river valleys.

Most recently, scientists have confirmed a correlation between Viluy traps (in the Vilyuysk region) on the Siberian Craton and the Kellwasser extinction by Ar/Ar dating.The Viluy Large igneous province covers most of the present day north-eastern margin of the Siberian Platform. The triple-junction rift system was formed during the Devonian Period; the Viluy rift is the western remaining branch of the system and two other branches form the modern margin of the Siberian Platform. Volcanic rocks are covered with post Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous sediments.Volcanic rocks, dyke belts, and sills that cover more than 320 × 103 km2, and a gigantic amount of magmatic material (more than 1000 × 103 km3) formed in the Viluy branch.Ages show that the two <b>volcanic</b> <b>phase</b> hypotheses are well supported and the weighted mean ages of each <b>volcanic</b> <b>phase</b> are 376.7 ± 3.4 and 364.4 ± 3.4 Ma or 373.4 ± 2.1 and 363.2 ± 2.0 Ma, which the first <b>volcanic</b> <b>phase</b> is in agreement with the age of 372.2 ± 3.2 Ma proposed for the Kellwasser event.

40|$|The Manihiki Plateau of {{the western}} Pacific {{is one of the}} world - wide {{greatest}} Large Igneous Province (LIP) on oceanic crust.

The subsequent break-up of Ontong Java Nui led to fragmentation of the Manihiki Plateau into three sub-plateaus, which all exhibit individual relicts of the “Super-LIP” break-up. We examine two deep crustal seismic refraction/wide-angle reflection profiles crossing the two largest sub-plateaus of the Manihiki Plateau, the Western Plateaus and the High Plateau. Modeling of P- and S-wave velocities reveals surprising differences in the crustal structure between the two sub-plateaus. Whereas the High Plateau shows a constant crustal thickness of 20 km, relicts of multiple <b>volcanic</b> <b>phases</b> and break-up features at its margins, the model of the Western Plateaus reveals a crustal thickness decreasing from 17 km to only 9 km. There is only little evidence of secondary <b>phases</b> of <b>volcanic</b> activity. The main upper crustal structure on the Western Plateaus consists of fault systems and sedimentary basins. We infer that the High Plateau experienced phases of strong secondary volcanism, and that tectonic deformation was limited to its edges. The Western Plateaus, on the contrary, were deformed by crustal stretching and underwent only little to no secondary volcanism. This indicates that the two main sub-plateaus of the Manihiki Plateau experienced a different geological history and have played their individual parts in the break-up history of Ontong Java Nui. ...|$|R
