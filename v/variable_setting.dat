40|$|Purpose – To {{determine}} {{the relationship among}} covariates used in financial distress studies. Design/methodology/approach – The study selects four specific bankruptcy studies and employs canonical correlation analysis to {{determine the}} relationship among the different <b>variable</b> <b>sets</b> that these studies used as predictors of financial distress. Canonical correlation analysis identifies the relationship and provides {{an indication of the}} amount of redundancy that exists between two <b>variable</b> <b>sets.</b> The four studies are representative of the genre, similar as to choice of statistical technique, and frequently cited by researchers. Findings – The research findings indicate that the relationships between the alternative <b>variable</b> <b>sets</b> are very weak and alternative <b>variable</b> <b>sets</b> do not represent similar financial relationships. Redundancy coefficients suggest that, if one <b>variable</b> <b>set</b> is redundant to another <b>variable</b> <b>set,</b> it is because the redundant <b>variable</b> <b>set,</b> is much smaller than the predictor <b>variable</b> <b>set.</b> Research limitations/implications – The results suggest that there is not much similarity among the <b>variable</b> <b>sets</b> used in financial distress studies; to the extent that there is any similarity, it is due to variables common to each <b>set</b> or one <b>variable</b> <b>set</b> being larger than the other <b>variable</b> <b>set.</b> Ad hoc <b>variable</b> selection in financial distress studies results in the use of alternative <b>variable</b> <b>sets</b> containing heterogeneous <b>variables</b> unrelated to one another. Originality/value – A common criticism of financial distress research is that a theory of corporate failure does not exist. Variable selection is not prompted by economic theory but is based upon suggestions in the literature, the success of variables in earlier studies, or the selection of a large <b>set</b> of <b>variables</b> with an accompanying data reduction procedure. Despite nearly 30 years of research in the area, the absence of an inter-correlational structure among alternative <b>variable</b> <b>sets</b> highlights the atheoretical nature of financial distress research.

30|$|The {{difference}} between the two rotation designs lies in the approach that we used to generate the <b>variable</b> <b>sets</b> in the rotated parts. While the common set was fixed to be the same in both designs, the method of constructing the rotated part differed. In Design 1, we constructed the <b>variable</b> <b>sets</b> so that each had a similar correlation with science performance (<b>Variable</b> <b>Set</b> 1.1 and <b>Variable</b> <b>Set</b> 1.2). In Design 2, we constructed the <b>variable</b> <b>sets</b> so that one had a lower correlation with science performance (<b>Variable</b> <b>Set</b> 2.1) and the other had a higher correlation with performance (<b>Variable</b> <b>Set</b> 2.2). This second design enabled us to ascertain if the correlations between the questions and performance would be likely if questions were assigned, in actuality, to the rotated parts of a questionnaire. In other words, the two designs allowed us to explore what impact the constructs in the rotated parts of the questionnaire had on various aspects of the proficiency estimates (i.e., means, standard deviations, percentiles, correlations), with that impact dependent on whether the constructs had a similar or a different relationship with performance.|$|R

Models considered are two artificial neural network methods (back-propagation and learning vector quantization (LVQ)) and two more standard statistical methods (multiple discriminant analysis and logistic regression analysis). The <b>variable</b> <b>sets</b> considered are the insurance regulatory information system (IRIS) variables, the financial analysis solvency tracking (FAST) variables, and Texas early warning information system (EWIS) variables, and a data set consisting of twenty-two variables selected by us in conjunction with the research staff at TDI and a review of the insolvency prediction literature. The results show that the back-propagation (BP) and LVQ outperform the traditional statistical approaches for all four <b>variable</b> <b>sets</b> with a consistent superiority across the two different evaluation criteria (total misclassification cost and resubstitution risk criteria), and that the twenty-two variables and the Texas EWIS <b>variable</b> <b>sets</b> are more efficient than the IRIS and the FAST <b>variable</b> <b>sets</b> for identification of financially troubled life insurers in most comparisons.

[...] Humboldt State University, Biology, 2007 Increased sophistication in {{methodology}} of echolocation monitoring has enabled {{the pursuit of}} a widened array of research and management objectives for bats. I developed and tested an automated program for detecting, measuring and classifying species of bat echolocation calls. I analyzed 584 echolocation sequences from nine bat species of the eastern United States (Lasiurus borealis, Myotis austroriparius, M. grisescens, M. leibii, M. lucifugus, M. septentrionalis, M. sodalis, Nycticieus humeralis, and Pipistrellus subflavus). A base <b>set</b> of 11 <b>variables</b> was measured automatically and manually, and an additional 28 variables were measured automatically {{as a part of the}} full <b>variable</b> <b>set.</b> Species were classified using Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) using each <b>variable</b> <b>set</b> and measurement method with both a single DFA and a hierarchical set of DFAs that classified genus level before species level. Classification rates were also summarized for a subset of the sequences with Discriminant probabilities > 0. 75. Overall classification rates were 67. 6 % for manually measured base <b>variable</b> <b>set,</b> 63. 0 % and 68. 3 % for automatically measured base and full <b>variable</b> <b>sets,</b> respectively, and 84. 4 % for the 62. 5 % of calls with Discriminant probabilities > 0. 75 using the automatically measured full <b>variable</b> <b>set.</b> Hierarchical classification improved overall classification rates by < 2 % for base <b>variable</b> <b>set</b> classifications and 6. 8 % and 6. 9 % for the automatically-measured full <b>variable</b> <b>set</b> with and without the Discriminant probability cutoff, respectively. Hierarchical classification worked synergistically with a large <b>variable</b> <b>set</b> to increase classification rates. Six of nine species had overall classifications of 93. 3 - 100 % with the best classifier. Also, six of nine species had higher classification rates than that achieved in previous studies. Automated call processing is a fully objective and repeatable method requiring less cost, time, and user expertise than manual methods, especially for large datasets. Further sophistication will likely continue to offer improvements to echolocation monitoring methodology. Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP...|$|R
