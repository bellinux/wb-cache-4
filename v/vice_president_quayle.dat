2500|$|On August 16, 1988, at the Republican {{convention}} in New Orleans, Louisiana, George H. W. Bush chose Quayle {{to be his}} running mate in the 1988 United States presidential election. The choice immediately became controversial. Outgoing President Ronald Reagan praised Quayle for his [...] "energy and enthusiasm". Press coverage of the convention was dominated with questions about [...] "the three Quayle problems", in the phrase of Brent Baker, {{executive director of the}} Media Research Center, a conservative group that monitors television coverage. The questions involved his military service, a golf trip to Florida with Paula Parkinson, and whether he had enough experience to be <b>vice</b> <b>president.</b> <b>Quayle</b> seemed at times rattled and at other times uncertain or evasive as he tried to handle the questions. Delegates to the convention generally blamed television and newspapers for the focus on Quayle's problems, but Bush's staff said they thought Quayle had mishandled the questions about his military record, leaving questions dangling. Although Bush was trailing by up to 15 points in public opinion polls taken before the convention, in August, the Bush/Quayle ticket took the lead, which they did not relinquish {{for the rest of the}} campaign.|$|E

5000|$|Immersion journalism {{has been}} criticized for being too {{subjective}} and partial to the journalist's opinion.

While President Bush and the Republican Party took a pro-life stance in 1992, First Lady Barbara Bush stated that she believed abortion to be a [...] "personal choice." ...|$|E

50|$|On February 12, 1992, {{friction}} between the largely astronaut-based management at NASA and the National Space Council led to Richard Truly, then NASA Administrator and a former astronaut, being forced out.

Skinner, the White House chief of staff, in urging Pres. Bush to remove Truly.

Stafford assembled teams of 40 full-time and 150 part-time members from the DOD, DOE and NASA, and completed the study called America at the Threshold, a road map for the next 30 years of U.S. manned spaceflight.

5000|$|In 1991, {{public opinion}} polls showed that the vast {{majority}} of those polled believed Thomas over Hill. [...] After extensive debate, the Committee sent the nomination to the full Senate without a recommendation either way. Thomas was confirmed by the Senate with a 52 to 48 vote on October 15, 1991, the narrowest margin for approval in more than a century. <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>Quayle</b> presided over the vote in his role as President of the Senate, partly in case his vote was needed to break a potential 50-50 tie for confirmation. The final floor vote was not strictly along party lines: 41 Republicans and 11 Democrats (Dixon (D-IL), Exon (D-NE), DeConcini (D-AZ), Robb (D-VA), Hollings (D-SC), Fowler (D-GA), Nunn (D-GA), Breaux (D-LA), Johnston (D-LA), Boren (D-OK), and Shelby (D-AL) now (R-AL)) voted to confirm while 46 Democrats and 2 Republicans (Jeffords (R-VT) later (I-VT) and Packwood (R-OR)) voted to reject the nomination; John Glenn was particularly vituperative in his rejection. Ironically Packwood himself would later be engulfed by sexual harassment allegations which ended his Senate career.|$|E

I didn't live in this century, but in this century's history"), self-contradictory and confused ("I have made good judgments in the past.

5000|$|During the 1992 presidential campaign, Vice President Dan Quayle {{used part}} of an {{interview}} between Gibson and Reform Party candidate Ross Perot to claim that Perot displayed contempt towards the United States Constitution. On the October 22, 1991, edition of Good Morning America, Gibson asked Perot what Perot would advise President George H. W. Bush to do to [...] "jump-start the economy". Perot stated that the U.S. helped Germany and Japan write their respective nations' constitutions: [...] "This was {{at a time when}} the industrial revolution had occurred. Our Constitution was written 200 years ago, before it occurred." [...] He added that those nations [...] "have an intelligent relationship between business and government." [...] <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>Quayle</b> responded: [...] "Mr. Perot, we do not need a new constitution. Our Constitution has served us well." [...] When Gibson interviewed Democratic presidential candidate and then-Governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton on June 28, 1992, The New York Times noted that Gibson repeatedly pressed Clinton to name his vice presidential candidate. Gibson interviewed President Bush on October 9 that year; Bush stated that he questioned Clinton's judgment, not patriotism, in traveling to the Soviet Union in 1969.|$|E
