25|$|This NSX {{became the}} world's first mass-produced car to feature an all-aluminium body. It was powered by an all-aluminium 3.0L V6 engine, which {{featured}} Honda's VTEC (Variable <b>Valve</b> <b>Timing</b> and Lift Electronic Control) system {{developed in the}} 1980s, a 5-speed manual or 4-speed Sports Shift automatic transmissions.|$|E
25|$|With {{launch of}} the Gentra X in South Korea, GMDAT had {{replaced}} engines of T250. 1.2L S-TEC II inline-four engine was updated with features such as dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) and timing chain (older version has timing belt) system. 1.6L E-TEC II engine had replaced with ECOTEC (GEN-III) engine with new features such as variable <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> mechanism.|$|E

50|$|The {{compressed}} air motor is thermodynamically simpler. It uses simple isothermal expansion. This means that expansion is less important, <b>valve</b> <b>timings</b> are thus longer and less crucial {{and so a}} simple valve may be adequate.|$|R
50|$|Under low-speed, high load, MIVEC ensures optimal torque {{delivery}} with the intake <b>valve</b> closing <b>timing</b> advanced to ensure sufficient air volume. At the same time, the exhaust <b>valve</b> opening <b>timing</b> is retarded {{to provide a}} higher expansion ratio and improved efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Camless engines {{can produce}} less {{emissions}} because they allow for more precise {{control of the}} combustion procedure, allowing for more complete combustion of all hydrocarbons. The computer will sense when not all fuel is being consumed and immediately relax <b>valve</b> <b>timings</b> to supply less fuel to the cylinder. Also, the ECU constantly adjusts <b>valve</b> <b>timings,</b> height and fuel/air mixtures to optimize efficiency for a given RPM/torque load. The ECU can also sense {{when there is a}} high amount of NOx and SOx (Sulfur oxide) emission and change the timing to make the Exhaust gas hotter or cooler. Since the engine is run electronically and not mechanically, camless engines can be updated to meet new emission regulations without mechanical modifications.|$|R
25|$|For {{model year}} 2011, Hyundai restyled the Azera with new {{front and rear}} fascias, new alloy wheels, and new fog lamps. The engines have been updated with dual {{variable}} <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> and the transmission has one more forward {{for a total of}} 6. The 3.3L V6 is now rated at 260hp and 3.8L V6 now makes with 283hp. The fuel economy has also been improved with 20/28 for 3.3 and 19/27 for 3.8 (EPA rating pending).|$|E
25|$|Pre-cooling {{air before}} {{it enters the}} cylinders, {{injection}} of any substance other than air and fuel into the cylinders, variable-geometry intake and exhaust systems, and variable <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> were forbidden. Each cylinder could have only one fuel injector and a single plug spark ignition. Separate starting devices were used to start engines in the pits and on the grid. The crankcase and cylinder block {{had to be made}} of cast or wrought aluminium alloys. The crankshaft and camshafts had to be made from an iron alloy, pistons from an aluminium alloy and valves from alloys based on iron, nickel, cobalt or titanium. These restrictions were in place to reduce development costs on the engines.|$|E
25|$|The new Corolla was {{introduced}} to the Australian market on 18 May 2007. It is available in both sedan and hatchback models, with more safety features and higher levels of luxury. The new 1.8-litre 2ZR-FE Dual VVT-i - with variable <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> for both intake and exhaust camshafts - will be the only engine available for the Australian model, promising better fuel economy than before, it also regains its 100kW power output. This figure decreased when the old model's 1.8-litre four-cylinder engine dropped to 93kW of power and 161Nm of torque (from 171Nm) in late 2005 to meet the 2006 Euro IV emissions requirements. A new 6-speed manual gearbox is standard, with a 4-speed automatic optional, despite speculation of a 5-speed like the new Honda Civic, a robotized 5-speed optional in the European Auris, or a CVT available in the Japanese model.|$|E
50|$|Other engine {{features}} were desmodromic <b>valves,</b> <b>timing</b> belts, two <b>valves</b> per cylinder (Taglioni {{did not love}} multi-valve), two-segment pistons (to reduce friction), a bearing type single-piece crankshaft with coupled connecting rods and four 40mm Dell'Orto carburettors installed on long inlet manifolds between the cylinder banks.|$|R
50|$|For Lotus use the Renault {{engine was}} given {{a number of key}} improvements, {{including}} a higher compression ratio (10.25 instead of 8.6), larger inlet <b>valves,</b> revised <b>valve</b> <b>timings,</b> dual <b>valve</b> springs and a twin-barrel carburettor. These changes lifted the engine's power by 30% from 63 bhp @ 5000 rpm to 82 bhp @ 6000 rpm. For US export, a de-tuned 1565cc version was used giving 80 bhp @ 6000 rpm.|$|R
50|$|Some other {{historical}} engine controls, {{which are}} automated in modern cars, were the choke <b>valve,</b> ignition <b>timing,</b> and spark arrestor.|$|R
25|$|A {{facelift}} in July 1976 saw the four-door saloon {{replaced with}} a five-door hatchback. Peugeot had been afraid that a five-door 104 would steal sales from the old-fashioned 204 Break, but with production of the 204 {{coming to an end}} in July 1976 this was no longer a concern. Rear light clusters were modified slightly with indicators that wrapped around to the sides of the car, and a 1.1-litre engine was also made available. The coupé was made available in two versions, the ZL and also the more powerful ZS with 66PS. A modified camshaft on the 954cc engines also retarded the <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> in order to favour fuel economy at the price of a slight power reduction. The revised models only appeared in right-hand drive form {{at the end of the}} year. 1977 proved to be the most successful year for the 104, with 190,000 being built.|$|E
25|$|The revised GT-R {{features}} an engine with revised mapping, changes to <b>valve</b> <b>timing,</b> larger inlets and a revised exhaust system which boosts rated power to 545bhp and 612Nm of torque from 3200 to 6000rpm. Changes {{also include a}} new more rigid front strut bar made from carbon composite, larger front brake rotors, new lighter and stiffer wheels, and revised Dunlop tires. Cosmetic changes include a new front bumper with integrated LEDs. The front bumper improves cooling to the radiator and front brakes while reducing drag. A new rear diffuser improves downforce and also includes additional rear cooling ducts. The interior was revised to improve the quality. This new version is offered with a new HDD CARWINGS navigation system with enhanced entertainment {{features an}}d USB port with iPod connectivity. The revised GT-R went on sale in Japan from mid November 2010 and February 2011 in Europe, North America and other regions.|$|E
25|$|As Honda {{entered into}} {{automobile}} manufacturing {{in the late}} 1960s, where Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota and Nissan had been making cars since before WWII, it appears that Honda instilled a sense of doing things a little differently than its Japanese competitors. Its mainstay products, like the Accord and Civic (with the exception of its USA-market 1993–97 Passport {{which was part of}} a vehicle exchange program with Isuzu (part of the Subaru-Isuzu joint venture)), have always employed front-wheel-drive powertrain implementation, which is currently a long held Honda tradition. Honda also installed new technologies into their products, first as optional equipment, then later standard, like anti lock brakes, speed sensitive power steering, and multi-port fuel injection in the early 1980s. This desire {{to be the first to}} try new approaches is evident with the creation of the first Japanese luxury chain Acura, and was also evident with the all aluminum, mid-engined sports car, the Honda NSX, which also introduced variable <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> technology, Honda calls VTEC.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{variable}} camshaft timing (VCT) disturbance on air-to-fuel ratio (AFR) signal is investigated for a twin-independent (TI) VCT engine. Different types of VCT disturbances on AFR signal are investigated. Gaseous fuel experiments are performed in addition to conventional petrol fuel experiments to show that not all the transient VCT disturbances acting on AFR are due to changes in air path dynamics. Experiments show that varying exhaust <b>valve</b> closing (EVC) <b>timing</b> has {{a significant effect on}} the air path dynamics and is an important cause of transient AFR deviations. However varying EVC does not affect the fuel puddle significantly. On the other hand varying inlet <b>valve</b> opening (IVO) <b>timing</b> has a strong effect on the fuel puddle size and is also an important cause of transient AFR deviations. Thus for superior transient AFR control in TI-VCT engines, it is essential to model not only the effects of <b>valve</b> <b>timings</b> on air path dynamics but also on the fuel path dynamics...|$|R
5000|$|Other {{differences}} of the North American models include imperial gauges, chrome bumper guards, side reflectors (illuminated from 1970), lower rear-axle ratios for faster acceleration yet lower top speeds, and no [...] "single-side" [...] parking lights.

500|$|The i has a [...] "rear-midship" [...] {{engine mounted}} {{just ahead of}} the rear axle, a highly unusual {{configuration}} in a small car where front-engine design has dominated since the 1970s. The 3B20 three-cylinder powerplant has an aluminium cylinder block, a displacement of 659cubic centimetres, and incorporates double overhead camshafts with MIVEC variable <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> in the cylinder head. Initially only an intercooled and turbocharged engine was offered, until a naturally aspirated version was introduced for 2007. A four-speed automatic gearbox transmits power to the rear or all four wheels, depending on specification.|$|E
500|$|Designed {{through early}} 1996, in September 1997 a revised LS 400 was {{introduced}} for the 1998 model year. Changes were a five-speed automatic transmission, increased engine output to , with variable <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> (VVT-i), and an added [...] of torque. Acceleration times and fuel economy were improved as a result. The suspension and steering also received minor tweaks to improve feel and handling. Stylistically, the vehicle sported a new front fascia, side mirrors, and updated wheels; a rear window diversity antenna replaced the conventional power mast. The cabin received upgrades, including a trip computer, HomeLink, retractable rear headrests, reading lamps, and ultraviolet-tinted glass, while the climate control gained a micron filtration feature with a smog sensor.|$|E

These changes extend further than the petrol engine as bi-fuel LPG variants benefit from an eightpercent improvement in fuel economy when run on LPG.

500|$|The {{final chapter}} of the third {{generation}} series was the VZ Commodore. Debuting in 2004 with {{a new series of}} V6 engines known as the Alloytec V6, both [...] and [...] versions of the 3.6-litre engine were offered. These were later upgraded to 180 and 195kilowatts (241 and 261hp) respectively in the VE model. When compared to the previous Ecotec engines, the Alloytec benefits from increased power output, responsiveness and fuel efficiency. The new engines were mated to a new five-speed 5L40E automatic transmission on the luxury V6 variants, and a new six-speed Aisin AY6 manual transmission on the six-cylinder SV6 sports variant. However, the long serving four-speed automatic carried on in other variants, albeit with further tweaks in an attempt to address complaints about refinement. A new 6.0-litre Generation 4 V8 engine was added to the range in January 2006 to comply with Euro III emission standards. Compared to the American version, both Active Fuel Management and variable <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> were removed. The Alloytec V6 was also affected by the new standards, which saw the peak output reduced to 172kilowatts (231hp).|$|E

40|$|The NOx {{emissions}} {{during the}} crank-start and cold fast-idle phases of a GDI engine are analyzed in detail. The NOx emissions {{of the first}} 3 firing cycles are studied under a wide set of parameters including the mass of fuel injected, start of injection, and ignition timing. The results show a strong dependence of the NOx emissions with injection timing; they are significantly reduced as the mixture is stratified. The impact of different <b>valve</b> <b>timings</b> on crank-start NOx emissions was analyzed. Late intake and early exhaust timings show similar potential for NOx reduction; 26 - 30 % lower than the baseline. The combined strategy, resulting in a large symmetric negative valve overlap, shows the greatest reduction; 59 % lower than the baseline. The cold fast-idle NOx emissions were studied under different equivalence ratios, injection strategies, combustion phasing, and <b>valve</b> <b>timings.</b> Slightly lean air-fuel mixtures result in a significant reduction of NOx. The engine-out emissions are highly sensitivity to combustion phasing. Initial retard results in lower mass NOx emissions up to CA 50 around 40 °CA aTDC-compression. After this point the increase in fuel consumption and the reduction on residual fraction reverse the trend leading {{to an increase in}} NOx mass emissions for later combustion phasing. Moderate exhaust timing advance is beneficial for NOx emissions and has no impact on the exhaust enthalpy flow. Engine and Fuels Research Consortiu...|$|R
