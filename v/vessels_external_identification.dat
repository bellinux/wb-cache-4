40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel concept for wave energy conversion, using fully enclosed appropriate internal body configurations, which provide inertial reaction against {{the motion of}} an <b>external</b> <b>vessel.</b> In this way, reliability, robustness and survivability under extreme weather conditions – a fundamental prerequisite for wave energy converters – can be achieved. Acting under the excitation of the waves, the <b>external</b> <b>vessel</b> is subjected to a simultaneous surge and pitch motion in all directions, ensuring maximum wave energy capture in comparison to other wave energy converters like point heave absorbers. The internal body is suspended from the <b>external</b> <b>vessel</b> body in such an appropriate geometrical configuration, that a symmetric four-bar mechanism is essentially formed. The main advantage of this suspension geometry is that a linear trajectory results for {{the centre of the}} mass of the suspended body with respect to the <b>external</b> <b>vessel,</b> enabling the introduction of a quite simple form of a Power Take Off (PTO) design. Thus, because of this simplicity and symmetry of the suspension geometry and of the PTO mechanism, the fundamental restrictions of other linear, pendulum or gyroscopic variants on inertial reacting bodies are significantly removed...|$|R

We define a natural notion of (potentially overlapping) communities in an affinity system, in which the members of a given community collectively prefer each other to anyone else outside the community.

50|$|There are two {{mechanisms}} {{that contribute to}} pressure ulcer development: (1) external pressure that compresses blood vessels and (2) friction and shearing forces that tear and injure blood <b>vessels.</b> <b>External</b> pressure applied over {{an area of the}} body, especially over the bony prominences can result in obstruction of the blood capillaries, which deprives tissues of oxygen and nutrients, causing ischemia(deficiency of blood in a particular area), hypoxia(inadequate amount of oxygen available to the cells), edema, inflammation, and, finally, necrosis and ulcer formation. Ulcers due to external pressure occur over the sacrum and coccyx, followed by the trochanter and the calcaneus(heel).Friction is damaging to the superficial blood vessels directly under the skin. It occurs when two surfaces rub against each other. The skin over the elbows and can be injured due to friction. The back can also be injured when patients are pulled or slid over bed sheets while being moved up in bed or transferred onto a stretcher.A shear is a separation of the skin from underlying tissues. When a patient is partially sitting up in bed, their skin may stick to the sheet, making them susceptible to shearing in case underlying tissues move downward with the body toward the foot of the bed. This may also be possible on a patient who slides down while sitting in a chair.|$|R

40|$|A novel {{concept of}} Wave Energy Converters is considered, {{composed}} from {{a class of}} fully enclosed, appropriate, internal body mechanisms, which provide inertial reaction against any multi-axis, multi-direction motion of an <b>external</b> <b>vessel.</b> This ensures maximum wave energy capture in comparison to other types of wave energy converters, based on internal reaction mechanisms. The internal bodies are suspended from the <b>external</b> <b>vessel</b> body in such an appropriate geometrical configuration, resulting to a linear trajectory for {{the center of the}} mass of the suspended body with respect to the <b>external</b> <b>vessel.</b> Moreover, the suspension geometry ensures a quite simple and robust technological implementation, removing the restrictions of other linear, pendulum or gyroscopic variants of inertial reacting bodies. Furthermore, the mass and the inertia distribution of the internal body is optimized for the maximal conversion and storage of the wave energy. As a result, the dynamic behavior of the internal body assembly, is essentially that of an equivalent vertical physical pendulum. However, the resulting equivalent pendulum length and inertia can far exceed those achieved by an actual technical implementation of other pendulum variants, resulting to a significant reduction of the suspended mass. A preliminary design of such a mechanism is considered and a simple equation is derived to estimate the power conversion potential of such a mechanism, {{as a function of the}} main geometrical and inertial design parameters. Then, the behavior of the mechanism is evaluated under a combination of surge and pitch excitations...|$|R
40|$|In this {{qualitative}} research project, I examine {{the development of}} landscapes of care for, and by, identified trafficked people {{and its implications for}} rebuilding a sense of place and identity. Through in-depth interviews and ethnographic data, I argue that discourse, place and identity interact to form complex landscapes within both providers and clients/patients that emerge as distinct experiences of care or non-care experiences. Each analytical chapter examines a particular production of care: a merging of psycho-legal care, the interactions of formalized informal caring relationships, and the burden of <b>external</b> <b>identification</b> in the configuration of self-identity among identified trafficked people. Building on anthropological theories of care (Giordano 2014; Mulla 2014; Stevenson 2014; Mattingly 2010), these chapters build the argument that, in contrast to humanitarian human trafficking and trauma discourse that focuses on a specific kind of trafficking experience; the complex assemblage of trafficking experience and subsequent care should be considered within what I term “structural trafficking. ” Becoming identified as trafficked is beneficial for receiving specific rights and services. However, this identity can also be detrimental for rebuilding a sense of self and place, because it assumes a fixed experience that translates to fixed care packages. I examine multiple landscapes of care to better understand potentials for care by expanding identity and coordinating existing and novel systems of care...|$|R

40|$|Background: the {{objective}} {{of this study was to}} correlate the presence of leptomeningeal venous. drainage and dysplastic venous dilation with the risk of intracranial hemorrhage in DAVFs. Methods: the subjects for this research were composed of 93 patients with DAVFs who were studied retrospectively with regard to therapeutic success and failure, who had undergone either neurosurgery or embolization or a combination of both methods, and whose disease was located in the cavernous sinus, the superior sagittal sinus, or the transverse-sigmoid sinus of the anterior fossa or of the tentorium. Also among these study subjects were patients who had had angiography done in at least 6 cranial <b>vessels</b> (<b>external</b> and internal carotid and vertebral arteries) before and after treatment and who had a minimum follow-up of 3 months. Cases of leptomeningeal venous drainage and dysplastic venous dilation and their associations with intracranial hemorrhage were ascertained for all the 93 case patients included in the study. Results: the presence of leptomeningeal drainage (P =. 0002) and that of dysplastic venous dilation (P =. 036) increased the risk of intracranial hemorrhage in case patients for DAVFs of the 5 regions. Conclusion: There is a statistical significance between risk of intracranial hemorrhage in DAVFs and the presence of leptomeningeal drainage and dysplastic venous dilation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
