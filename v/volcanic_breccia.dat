25|$|Shiprock is {{composed}} of fractured <b>volcanic</b> <b>breccia</b> and black dikes of igneous rock called minette, or lamprophyre. It is the erosional remnant of the throat of a volcano, and the <b>volcanic</b> <b>breccia</b> formed in a diatreme. The rock probably was originally formed 2,500–3,000 feet (750–1,000 meters) below the Earth's surface, but it was exposed after {{millions of years of}} erosion. Wall-like sheets of minette, known as dikes, radiate away from the central formation. Radiometric age determinations of the minette establish that these volcanic rocks solidified about 27 million years ago. Shiprock is in the northeastern part of the Navajo Volcanic Field—a field that includes intrusions and flows of minette and other unusual igneous rocks that formed about 30 million years ago. Agathla (El Capitan) in Monument Valley is another prominent volcanic neck in this volcanic field.|$|E
25|$|Lavas {{may also}} pick up rock fragments, {{especially}} if flowing over unconsolidated rubble on the flanks of a volcano, and these form volcanic breccias, also called pillow breccias.

25|$|The {{volcanic}} pipe is a diatreme, {{composed of}} olivine lamproite, present as tuff and lava. Peripheral volcanic facies suggest the lamproite eruption formed a maar. At {{the margins of}} the volcanic pipe the lamproite is mixed with a <b>volcanic</b> <b>breccia</b> containing shattered wall rock fragments mixed and milled by the eruption. Minerals in the marginal facies include zeolite minerals, micas, kaolinite and clays, typical of post-eruption hydrothermal circulation.|$|E
25|$|The seconed type of volcano-ice {{interaction}} is located {{only to the}} east, south and southwest of the Tanzilla Plateau, in the Cassiar Mountains, Skeena Mountains and in the Boundary Ranges. Volcanic activity in these locations is also largely mafic in composition, but the extensive elevations of these areas had a much more impressive influence on glaciation and subglacial volcanism. High altitude glaciation took over when the Cordilleran Ice Sheet was not present and even when buried by the Cordilleran Ice Sheet, basal ice movement was strongly influenced by the deep, pre-glacial drainages. Accordingly, the erosional remnants of subglacial volcanoes are minor and intermittent. In the Skeena Mountains, separated outcrops of pillow lava and <b>volcanic</b> <b>breccia</b> are generally found {{side by side on}} the summits of sharp rugged mountain ridges, with presumably temporally-associated pyroclastic rocks having collected downslope.|$|E

It may also represent the largest supervolcanic eruption of the Paleozoic era. Most of the volcanics were laid down during a timespan of possibly less than two million years. A region of coarse <b>volcanic</b> <b>breccias</b> in the Flat Landing Brook Formation is interpreted to be the remnants of a caldera.|$|R

2500|$|Silverthrone Caldera is {{the largest}} and best-preserved of the two caldera {{complexes}} in the northern Garibaldi chain, the other being the Franklin Glacier complex [...] to the east-southeast. The caldera has a diameter of [...] and contains breccia, lava flows and lava domes. Like Franklin to the east-southeast, the geology of Silverthrone is poorly known due to minimal studies. The region surrounding the Silverthrone complex is significantly jagged due to the mountainous terrain of the Coast Mountains. Near vertical flanks extend from near sea level to more than [...] in elevation. Silverthrone is significantly younger than the Franklin Glacier complex to the east-southeast and its volcanics likely have ages comparable to other volcanics throughout the Garibaldi chain. The oldest volcanics at the Silverthrone Caldera complex are composed of volcanic breccias, some of which became fused together by intense volcanic heat from when the deposits were first erupted. After these volcanics were deposited, a series of dacite, andesite and rhyolite lava flows were erupted upon <b>volcanic</b> <b>breccia</b> from the first volcanic phase. These eroded lava flows in total are [...] thick. Volcanics in the lower portion of this series of lava flows give a potassium-argon date of 750,000years while volcanics slightly above the lava flows are 400,000years old. The most recent volcanic activity produced a series of andesite and basaltic andesite lava flows down Pashleth Creek and the Machmell and Kingcome river valleys. The lava flow extending from near Pashleth Creek to down the Machmell River valley is over [...] in length. Its small amount of erosion indicates {{that it could be}} 1,000years old or younger.|$|E

The fossil plants obtained from these plant bearing rocks indicate the upper Pliocene age. On the other hand, the Mogi olivine basalts unconformably overlain by the basal conglomerates of the Mogi plant bed bear a thin conglomerate layer with the pebbles of cristalline schists and quarts at the basal part, resting unconformably upon the granitic rocks of the Cretaceous age.

These basalts exist {{beyond the limits of}} the Nagasaki volcanic activity. Although the Mogi plant bed and the Matsuura basalts to which the Mogi basalts belong are of the upper Pliocene age, the Plio-Pleistocene boundary line should be drawn between the Mogi plant bed and the basalts in the Mogi district from the volanic activity...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) Geological Sciences. Plate 1; Geologic map of an {{area near}} El Rosario, Baja California, Mexico. Plate 2; Structural cross-sections, in back pocket. Original {{geological}} mapping performed on aerial photographs (scale 1 : 15, 000). Base map (1 : 15, 000) constructed from the aerial photographs using the hand-templet method with geology plotted on the base map. Approximately 1, 820 meters of Aptian-Albian Alisitos Formation is continuously exposed within a 100 square kilometer area east of El Rosario, Baja California. To the east this formation is intruded by a granodiorite pluton of the Peninsular Range batholith and to the west is unconformably overlain by non-marine strata of the Late Cretaceous Rosario Formation. Three diabase sills intrude the Alisitos section. Within the Alisitos Formation nine members have been recognized. The members from oldest to youngest are: Member A (275 meters), composed of interbedded dacite flows, tuffaceous agglomerates, <b>volcanic</b> <b>breccias,</b> and acidic welded tuffs; Member B (50 - 500 meters), composed of dacite flows; Member C (165 meters), composed of fossiliferous, interbedded volcanically derived sandstones, siltstones, conglomerates, with minor andesite flows, pyroclastic rocks and limestones; Member D (60 meters), composed of volcanically derived conglomerates and sandstones; Member E (165 meters), composed of thinly interbedded, volcanically derived shales, siltstones, and sandstones, with locally abundant conglomerates and limestones; Member F (210 meters), composed of agglomerates, <b>volcanic</b> <b>breccias,</b> and tuffs; Member G (70 meters), composed of interbedded dacite, andesite, basalt flows, with interbedded agglomerates; Member H (50 meters), composed of interbedded tuffs and agglomerates; and Member I (325 meters), composed of interbedded tuffs, agglomerates, <b>volcanic</b> <b>breccias</b> with minor andesite flows. Members C through E are fossiliferous. Significant marine fauna are Quadratotrigonia, Apiotrigonia, Eucymatoceras, and Ostrea. Based on restricted occurrences of Trigoniids in western North America Late Aptian is suggested as {{the age of the}} lower portion of the fossiliferous section. Mineralogical, textural, and fossil evidence indicates that a nearby volcanic source supplied sediments to a relatively shallow basin distant or sheltered from continental sediments during the deposition of Members C through E. Stratigraphic evidence indicates that the source area was to the west during the deposition of Member C. Structurally, the Alisitos Formation is a northwest- southeast trending homocline dipping gently to the south. Gravity faults of small displacement parallel this regional trend. Two joint planes are developed, one paralleling the regional trend and one perpendicular to it. Field evidence indicates that the Alisitos Formation was folded by northeast-southwest compression, initially faulted, intruded by diabase sills, and metamorphosed prior to the intrusion of the pluton. It is proposed that subsequent to this intrusion and deposition of the Rosario Formation, renewed compressional forces acting along a similar northeast-southwest trend resulted in renewed faulting...|$|R
