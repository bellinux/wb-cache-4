In {{order to}} solve the problem that <b>vehicle</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>system</b> is of bad {{uniformity}} and versatility, which due to the different <b>vehicle</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>system</b> communication protocols developed by the different vehicle OEMs according to their own needs, this paper proposes a design method of vehicle CAN bus diagnostic communication module based on AUTOSAR standard. This module follow the AUTOSAR standard and it can be implemented in accordance with the international standard ISO 15765. The results of the test show that when this module is applied to some car dashboard, it can satisfy the needs of the vehicle diagnostic communication system, and it is of good standardization, versatility and portability. FOREWORD With the development of electronic control systems, more and more ECUs(Electric Control Unit) are applied to a car. They control the engine, airbags, windows {{and other parts of the}} car, improve automotive safety and comfort, but bring new problems at the same time. Such as body harness increasing, ECU software architecture is more complex, automobile fault diagnosis is located difficultly. There is no unitized diagnosis criteria in the early stage of automotive diagnostic technology development. Motor vehicle manufacturers develop their own diagnostic protoco...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades the {{technological}} development of vehicles has evolved rapidly and today almost {{everything in a}} vehicle is controlled by electronic systems. At present time {{there are no signs}} of any weakening regarding this trend. With the maturity of wireless communication technologies it is possible to provide new kind of telematics services. A category of telematics concern vehicle maintenance and these services depend and take advantage of electronic systems in <b>vehicles.</b> Remote <b>vehicle</b> <b>diagnostics</b> is such a service, which provides opportunities to conduct <b>vehicle</b> <b>diagnostics</b> work remotely. For a while now, there has been optimistic expectations on the potential of providing such services to customers among the automotive industry. These expectations have largely been {{based on the assumption that}} remote <b>vehicle</b> <b>diagnostics</b> could prevent breakdowns by detecting vehicle problems at an early stage. However, the true potential have yet to be revealed and manufacturers struggle in finding profitable business models. This master thesis studies remote <b>vehicle</b> <b>diagnostics</b> intended for the commercial vehicle aftermarket. Reasons to why remote <b>vehicle</b> <b>diagnostics</b> services have failed to reach a strong market penetration are outlined and explained. We have found that such services are often based on a weak architectural design. Therefore, this study examines how a suitable software architecture, for an aftermarket remote <b>vehicle</b> <b>diagnostics</b> <b>system,</b> should be designed. We argue that such software architecture should focus on a well-prepared flexible design and cost-effectiveness. This study has used an explorative approach towards remote <b>vehicle</b> <b>diagnostics</b> with a clear connection to the thoughts of “Practical Informatics”. The conclusion of our study is presented as several design principles that together contribute to software architecture suitable for the aftermarket. Further, we describe how we have implemented our architecture using prototyping, to validate the architecture in real environment and derivate the accomplishment of “proof of concept”...|$|R

Within the broad mission of DOT to "improve the quality of [the] nation’s roads and the vehicles [that] operate on them " (JPO 1997, 4; JPO 1999, 2), the primary stated goal of IVI is to enhance highway safety by accelerating the deployment of driver-assistance technologies, such as collision avoidance systems and operator and <b>vehicle</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>systems,</b> in passenger, commercial, transit, and special-purpose vehicles. Secondary goals are to improve highway efficiency, mobility, productivity, and environmental quality. The program is managed by the JPO, representing the appropriate modal administrations of DOT. The JPO will work in partnership with manufacturers, suppliers, state and local governments, and other stakeholders to accomplish the program goals. The committee’s charge for this first review is to comment broadly on the IVI program goals, program design and operation, strategic plan, and individual program elements. As the program matures, future reviews will be focused to a greater extent on an assessment of individual partnerships, program operations, and progress on achieving program goals.

40|$|A {{significant}} number of electronic control units (ECUs) are nowadays networked in automotive vehicles to help achieve advanced vehicle control and eliminate bulky electrical wiring. This, however, inevitably leads to increased complexity in <b>vehicle</b> fault <b>diagnostics.</b> Traditional off-board fault diagnostics and repair at service centres, by using only diagnostic trouble codes logged by conventional onboard diagnostics, can become unwieldy especially when dealing with intermittent faults in complex networked electronic systems. This can result in inaccurate and time consuming diagnostics {{due to lack of}} real-time fault information of the interaction among ECUs in the network-wide perspective. This thesis proposes a new framework for on-board knowledge-based diagnostics focusing on network level faults, and presents an implementation of a real-time in-vehicle network <b>diagnostic</b> <b>system,</b> using case-based reasoning. A newly developed fault detection technique and the results from several practical experiments with the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>system</b> using a network simulation tool, a hardware- in-the- loop simulator, a disturbance simulator, simulated ECUs and real ECUs networked on a test rig are also presented. The results show that the new <b>vehicle</b> <b>diagnostics</b> scheme, based on the proposed new framework, can provide more real-time network level diagnostic data, and more detailed and self-explanatory diagnostic outcomes. This new system can provide increased diagnostic capability when compared with conventional diagnostic methods in terms of detecting message communication faults. In particular, the underlying incipient network problems that are ignored by the conventional on-board diagnostics are picked up for thorough fault diagnostics and prognostics which can be carried out by a whole-vehicle fault management system, contributing to the further development of intelligent and fault-tolerant vehicles...|$|R

In {{addition to the}} real-time vehicle time-location information including date, time, longitude, and latitude obtained from GPS receiver, the GPS-OBD module can also record the real-time vehicle operation information including vehicle speed, engine rpm, coolant temperature, battery voltage, fault code number, and others from OBD system.
