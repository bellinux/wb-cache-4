40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{occurrence}} {{and potential}} orthodontic causes of cervical invasive root resorption (CIRR) are unknown. We aimed {{to identify the}} occurrence <b>of</b> <b>CIRR</b> in molar teeth of orthodontic patients treated with fixed appliances. METHODS: All patients invited for final orthodontic recall between November 2009 and March 2011 were included. From 175 patients, 108 (46 men/ 62 women; mean age, 25 ± 5 years; mean time after bracket removal, 8 ± 2 years) were available. The first and second molar teeth (N = 858) of these patients were investigated for clinical and radiographic signs <b>of</b> <b>CIRR.</b> Patients identified with such signs were asked to have limited-volume cone-beam computed tomography scans performed. RESULTS: No clinical signs <b>of</b> <b>CIRR</b> were detected. CIRR could {{not be ruled out}} on bite-wing radiographs in 18 patients. CIRR was thus identified in 1 patient in whom a second maxillary molar was affected. All first molars had been extracted in this patient, and the second molars had been moved mesially over a long distance. The 3 other second molars showed surface resorption. CONCLUSIONS: CIRR in molar teeth of orthodontic patients have a low mid-term occurrence (0. 9 %; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 2 %- 5. 2 %). Long movement distances and/or long treatment duration {{may be related to the}} development of these lesions...|$|R

40|$|Background. A two-step {{selection}} process, {{consisting of}} cognitive and noncognitive measures, {{is common in}} medical school admissions. Objective. To estimate the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> this process in predicting academic performance, {{taking into account the}} complex and pervasive effect of range restriction in this context. Methods. The estimation <b>of</b> the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the two-step process included a sequential correction for range restriction and an estimation <b>of</b> the predictive <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the process in its entirety. Data were collected from 1, 002 undergraduate students from four cohorts (2006 / 07 – 2009 / 10) at three medical schools in Israel. Results. The predictive <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the composite of the cognitive measures with respect to Year 1 performance was high, resulting entirely from the predictive <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the admission test (a standard measure of ability). The predictive <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the noncognitive measure was moderate. The predictive <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the process in its entirety was high, its value dependent on the weights given to the cognitive and noncognitive measures. Conclusion. A cognitive admission test has a high predictive validity with respect to Year 1 performance. The addition of a noncognitive measure in the second step does not markedly diminish the predictive <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the selection process with respect to academic achievement...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the use of {{management}} selection methods and their perceived ability to accurately predict future job performance was conducted. Managers' perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> management selection methods were also compared with the research evidence <b>of</b> the 'actual' <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> those selection methods. The correlation between the 'actual' <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the selection methods and the perceived validity was small (Pearson r = 0. 471). The respondents' perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the management selection methods included in the questionnaire also had only a slight relationship with the use of those selection methods in New Zealand organisations (r = 0. 4882). Managers appear to have a reasonably accurate perception <b>of</b> the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the more uncommon selection methods such as graphology and astrology. However, their perception <b>of</b> the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> some of the more common selection methods is incorrect. For example, they believe that ordinary interviews, references and work experience have high levels <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> when in fact they do not.

40|$|The <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> {{borderline}} {{personality disorder}} (BPD) {{has been a}} topic of much controversy in psychiatry. Over the last two decades, a wealth of empirical work has challenged long-held concerns regarding the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> adolescent BPD. However, this {{research has been conducted}} within a traditional approach to psychiatric nosology. In this article, we aim to evaluate the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> adolescent BPD as guided by both the Robins and Guze criteria for the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> psychiatric constructs and the new National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria (NIMH RDoC). We used the five principles of the Robins and Guze approach to evaluate selected research from our own and other groups regarding the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> adolescent BPD. These principles include clinical description studies, laboratory studies, studies that delimitate the disorder from other related syndromes, follow-up studies, and family studies. Within the Robins and Guze criteria framework, evidence to date supports the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> adolescent BPD to some extent. However, limitations of the research about the construct <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> adolescent BPD have also been identified, most notably regarding the delimitation of adolescent BPD from other disorders as well as a lack of longitudinal and family studies. Given these limitations and the limitations of the Robins and Guze approach to psychiatric nosology, we recommend exploring the potential of the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria as a complement to previous work...|$|R
