50|$|A {{specialized}} {{example of}} a <b>volumetric</b> <b>pipette</b> is the microfluid pipette (capable of dispensing as little as 10µL) designed with a circulating liquid tip that generates a self-confining volume in front of its outlet channels.|$|E
50|$|A Mohr pipette, {{also known}} as a {{graduated}} pipette, is a type of pipette used to measure the volume of the liquid dispensed, although not as accurately as a <b>volumetric</b> <b>pipette.</b> These use a series of marked lines (as on a graduated cylinder) to indicate the different volumes. They {{come in a variety of}} sizes, and are used much like a burette, in that the volume is found by calculating the difference of the liquid level before and after.|$|E
50|$|Graduated {{cylinders}} {{are often}} {{used to measure the}} volume of a liquid. Graduated cylinders are generally more accurate and precise than laboratory flasks and beakers, but they should not be used to perform volumetric analysis; volumetric glassware, such as a volumetric flask or <b>volumetric</b> <b>pipette,</b> should be used, as it is even more accurate and precise. Graduated cylinders are sometimes used to measure the volume of a solid indirectly by measuring the displacement of a liquid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Volumetric</b> <b>pipettes</b> or bulb pipette {{allow the}} user to measure a volume of {{solution}} extremely precisely (precision of four significant figures). These pipettes have a large bulb with a long narrow portion above with a single graduation mark as it is calibrated for a single volume (like a volumetric flask). Typical volumes are 10, 25, and 50 mL. <b>Volumetric</b> <b>pipettes</b> are commonly used to make laboratory solutions from a base stock as well as prepare solutions for titration.|$|R
50|$|Other {{companies}} have pushed integration even further: {{on top of}} interfacing to the specific consumables used in biology, some robots (Andrew by Andrew Alliance, see picture) have been designed with the capability of interfacing to <b>volumetric</b> <b>pipettes</b> used by biologists and technical staff. Essentially, all the manual activity of liquid handling can be performed automatically, allowing humans spending their time in more conceptual activities.|$|R
30|$|There {{could also}} be {{uncertainty}} {{in the preparation of}} samples; however, this is expected to be smaller. All liquid samples were prepared using calibrated <b>volumetric</b> <b>pipettes.</b> Furthermore, rapidly frozen mixtures of HDO and H 2 O have not been found to fractionate significantly, especially when the freezing is rapid [34, 35]. Nevertheless, the final values of the D/H ratio were compared to the initial value obtained {{at the start of the}} experiment during which the surfaces of the samples were unprocessed and should have been sublimating at close to their bulk isotopic ratios.|$|R
50|$|A <b>volumetric</b> <b>pipette</b> or bulb pipette allows {{extremely}} accurate measurement (to four significant figures) {{a volume}} of solution. These pipettes have a large bulb with a long narrow portion above with a single graduation mark as it is calibrated for a single volume (like a volumetric flask). Typical volumes are 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50 and 100 mL. Volumetric pipettes are commonly used in analytical chemistry to make laboratory solutions from a base stock {{as well as to}} prepare solutions for titration.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, the {{accuracy}} of a graduated pipette was {{not as good as}} that of a <b>volumetric</b> <b>pipette</b> (accuracy of 3 significant fig); however, with improved manufacturing methods, the accuracies listed by the manufacturer can equal volumetric pipettes. Graduated pipettes are considered to be more precise than Pasteur pipette. They have +/- tolerances that range from 0.6% to 0.4% of the nominal volume when measured at [...] It works by creating a partial vacuum above the liquid-holding chamber and releasing the partial vacuum created to draw up or deliver liquid. Graduated pipettes are manufactured according to ISO specifications for accuracy and the arrangement of the graduations. Grade A and AS pipettes have the highest accuracy and S stands for swift delivery. It has identical error limits as the DIN EN ISO standards. Grade B pipettes generally have twice the error as compared to grade A and AS pipettes.They commonly come in 5, 10, 25 and 50 mL volumes. A variety of propipetters have been developed, both entirely manual and electrically assisted. Originally pipettes were made of soda-lime glass but, currently many are made of borosilicate glass; disposable graduated pipettes are often made of polystyrene.|$|E
40|$|A contact lens may {{be removed}} from the eye either {{manually}} or by using a small rubber sucker. The removal of lenses by the rubber sucker technique is difficult at times, especi-ally when the lens is fenestrated, as the vacuum cannot be maintained. Assistance in the removal of the lens may be obtained by modifying existing rubber suckers. The bulb is cut off with a sharp blade and into the lumen so exposed is inserted a glass pipette removed from a drop-bottle. The other end of the pipette is attached to a rubber tube of convenient length. A second glass pipette which has been lightly packed with cotton wool to act as a barrier to saliva and to prevent condensation in the tube is fitted into {{the other end of the}} rubber tube. The device is then assembled and suction is provided by the mouth and the vacuum controlled by the tongue as in using a <b>volumetric</b> <b>pipette.</b> This method should prove most useful in the removal of soft lenses. The surface tension between cornea and fenestrated lens is readily reduced and the lens may be removed more easily by gently blowing down the pipette with the bell of the applicator apposed to the fenestration or fenestrations. A haptic type sucker may be used for large hard lenses and for soft lenses. Received for publication September 2. 197...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{nature and}} {{magnitude}} of experimental errors due to ⁶⁵Zn adsorption by inorganic surfaces was examined in a laboratory system designed to measure ⁶⁵Zn uptake by marine phytoplankton. In the pH range, 6. 3 ±. 1 to 7. 5 ±. 1, a precipitate formed in the algal nutrient medium selected for the system. To this seawater-base medium, zinc was added only as carrier-free ⁶⁵Zn. The precipitate increased in both volume and tendency for ⁶⁵Zn uptake as the pH increased. At a pH of 7. 5 ±. 1 the particles, predominantly orthophosphates, accumulated 70 percent of the ⁶⁵Zn in the medium in 24 hours. It was therefore concluded that ⁶⁵Zn adsorption by undetected precipitates could result in serious errors in measurements of ⁶⁵Zn uptake by marine phytoplankton.

25|$|Bubble flow meters: A simple, yet highly {{accurate}} way {{to measure}} flow rates involves timing movement of bubbles of soap film up glass tubes between marks of known volume. The glass tube is connected at the bottom (for push systems) or at the top (for pull systems) to the air stream. A small rubber pipette bulb attached {{at the base of}} the tube acts as both a reservoir and delivery system for the soap bubbles. Operation is simple. First, wet the glass surface along the path bubbles travel (e.g., press the bulb so that copious amounts of soap are pushed up the glass by the air flow) to provide a virtually friction-free surface. Second, pinch the bulb so that one clean bubble is produced. With a stopwatch in hand, record the time required for the bubble to travel between marks on the glass. Note the volume recorded on the upper mark (e.g., 125 = 125ml), divide the volume by the time required to travel between marks and the result is the flow rate (ml/s). These instruments can be purchased from a variety of sources, but they may also be constructed from appropriate-sized, glass <b>volumetric</b> <b>pipettes.</b>|$|R
30|$|To {{research}} {{the influence of}} sample preparation, a d-optimal response surface design was used. The sample volume was varied at levels of 10, 25, 50, 100 and 200  mL. The receiver volume (volume of graduated flask) was set at either exactly the same volume as the sample volume, or at the double volume (for example, 25  mL of sample were either distilled into 25 or 50  mL). Finally as third factor, <b>volumetric</b> glass <b>pipettes</b> or graduated flasks were used to transfer the sample volume into the Kjeldatherm tube.|$|R
50|$|Pipetting {{syringes}} are hand-held {{devices that}} combine {{the functions of}} <b>volumetric</b> (bulb) <b>pipettes,</b> graduated pipettes, and burettes.

A glass or plastic pipette tube is used with a thumb-operated piston and PTFE seal which slides within the pipette in a positive displacement operation.

This arrangement provides improvements in precision, handling safety, reliability, economy, and versatility. No disposable tips or pipetting aids are needed with the pipetting syringe.|$|R
40|$|Macroconidia {{are needed}} in {{quantity}} {{for a variety of}} purposes, including transformation experiments. (At one time conidia were available commercially in gram quantities for use in isolating nucleases!) Efforts have been made to define conditions that favor conidiation, both in wild type and in sparsely conidiating mutants. Variables include physical and chemical substrate, humidity, light, aeration, and temperature. Procedures Significant increases in yield were obtained with wild type, cr- 1, and smco- 7 when a 0. 5 g cotton cube was centered in a shallow layer of solid minimal medium in a 100 ml flask (1. 5 % agar, 1. 5 % sucrose) (Kana-Uchi and Murayama 1996). Inoculum was placed {{on the surface of the}} medium but not on the cotton. After 7 days growth at room temperature, 30 ml of water was added and a spatula was used to squeeze the cotton cube and release conidia into suspension. Koski and Hedman (1971) used similar medium in flasks. These were incubated in the dark at 34 °C for 64 hours, then exposed to light at 24 °C for various periods before harvesting, filtering, and plating on sorbose. Maximum count of viable conidia was obtained for flasks exposed to light for 24 hours. Barratt (1963) described a procedure modified from Wainwright (1959) that involves incubating conidiating cultures in large Fernbach flasks aerated with a gentle stream of sterile humidified air. Conidia were harvested using a 0. 1 % Tween 80 solution. When smaller quantities of conidia are required, the most convenient source may be agar slants in 150 mm culture tubes. Yields are greater when the slant is blunt rather than elongated (D. Newmeyer, personal communication).

30|$|Measurement {{uncertainty}} {{was evaluated}} {{based on the}} bottom-up approach (International Organization for Standardization [1995]). All the contributions were obtained from calibration certificates and from statistical analysis of repeated measurements. Trueness of the method was calculated from results of CRM analysis, while repeatability was evaluated from precision experiments. The uncertainty of volumetric operations (<b>volumetric</b> flasks, <b>pipettes)</b> was calculated by using manufacturer data on calibration uncertainty (from certificates), the uncertainty {{associated with the use}} of glassware at a temperature different from that of calibration, and the repeatability of volumetric deliveries. Uncertainty of balances was calculated from data obtained from calibration certificates (declared uncertainty) and the repeatability of weighing. After estimation, all sources of uncertainty were combined according to the law of propagation of uncertainties, obtaining the combined standard uncertainty (u(Ca)). The final result was reported as expanded uncertainty (U(Ca)), calculated as U(Ca) = k × u(Ca), where k is the coverage factor, corresponding to a 95 % confidence level.|$|R
40|$|Aim: Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) is {{regarded}} as a promising medium for detection of markers of periodontal disease activity. Very few investigators have examined concentration of electrolytes in GCF, but most results are not in agreement to one another. This study was undertaken with an objective of quantitative estimation of sodium, potassium and calcium concentrations of GCF in gingivitis and periodontitis, to find the reliability of these ions as diagnostic markers and to analyze the relation of these ions to one another. This will indicate stage of disease activity which helps in early diagnosis, prevention and treatment of periodontal diseases. Materials and Methods: The patients selected for the study included both sexes, aging from 18 to 55 years, divided into two groups: gingivitis (group I) and periodontitis (group II). Using <b>volumetric</b> microcapillary <b>pipette,</b> 5 μl GCF was collected for quantitative analysis of sodium, potassium and calcium using flame photometry.

40|$|Background: Periodontitis {{involves}} intricate {{interactions of}} the biofilm with the host immunoinflammatory response and subsequent alterations in bone and connective tissue homeostasis. Neopterin is a marker, {{belonging to the}} class of pteridines, which is associated with cell-mediated immunity. It is produced by interferon-γ stimulated macrophages. The levels of neopterin in body fluids are elevated in infections, autoimmune diseases, malignancies and allograft rejections. This investigation was designed to estimate the levels of neopterin in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) in health, chronic gingivitis and chronic periodontitis. Materials and Methods: Thirty subjects were divided into three groups of ten subjects each as with healthy periodontium (Group 1), chronic gingivitis (Group 2) and chronic periodontitis (Group 3). The GCF samples {{were obtained from the}} subjects by placing color-coded calibrated, <b>volumetric,</b> micro-capillary <b>pipettes</b> extracrevicularly. The samples were placed in plastic vials and stored at − 70 °C until the time of neopterin estimation using enzyme immunoassay. Results: The mean neopterin level in Group 3 (126. 28 ± 37. 70 nmol/L) is significantly higher than the mean neopterin level in Group 1 (48. 66 ± 18. 82 nmol/L) and Group 2 (70. 68 ± 18. 26 nmol/L) (P 0. 05). Conclusions: The results of our study indicate that the neopterin levels in GCF are positively associated with periodontal disease, which may provide a useful tool in monitoring its progression. Nevertheless, further longitudinal studies are required with larger sample sizes in which neopterin levels are progressively estimated and compared to baseline values...|$|R

However, when S is present in its elemental form in the fertilizer, the sample must be decomposed in closed flask in microwave oven for accurate S quantification. The uncertainties of the method were estimated according to the bottom-up approach, which were 7. 1, 4. 3, and 7. 8 % for B, S and P, respectively. The main sources of uncertainty identified were the intermediate precision, accuracy, regression of the calibration curve and errors originated from <b>volumetric</b> flasks and <b>pipettes.</b> Satisfactory results were obtained {{in the analysis of}} certified reference materials and sample from inter-laboratory programs as well as S recovery in a commercial elemental sulfur sample...|$|R
40|$|Silicon is an {{essential}} element found in cereals, fruits, vegetables pasta, rice, etc. Rice husk ash {{is one of the}} most silica rich raw materials after complete combustion among the family of agro wastes. For the preparation of pure activated silica rice husk are now widely used as raw material.

The exact quantity of silica in the rice husk ash is therefore essential to know before further research. Keeping these facts an attempt has been made to determine the silica content by titrimetric method followed by quantification of uncertainty budget in four different variety of rice husk ash. The major sources of uncertainty in the measurement have been identified as contributions from repeatability, standardization of sodium hydroxide, titration, weight of the sample taken, volume measurement by <b>volumetric</b> flask, burette, <b>pipette,</b> weighing balance etc. All major sources of uncertainty have been identified and combined following the EURACHEM guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Background: Periodontitis {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{as a source of}} inflammation for pathological changes in distant sites. Interleukin- 1 alpha (IL- 1 α) has shown to have specific roles in inflammation, immunity, tissue breakdown, and tissue homeostasis. This study assessed the correlation of periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA) index with the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) levels of IL- 1 α, which would be helpful in evaluating the validity of PISA index in terms of reflection of the disease. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 subjects were recruited for this study and 20 subjects with healthy gingiva (Group I) served as controls and 20 subjects served as cases with periodontitis (Group II). Samples of GCF were obtained from one site in each patient by placing color-coded, calibrated, <b>volumetric</b> microcapillary <b>pipettes</b> extracrevicularly, and subjected to ELISA test. Results: There was a statistical significance for mean probing depth (PD) and periodontal epithelial surface area (PESA) (P < 0. 01), mean bleeding on probing and PISA, IL- 1 α (P < 0. 01) and PESA (P < 0. 05) in Group I. Statistical significance was found between PISA and IL- 1 α in Group I (P < 0. 01). A positive correlation was found in Group II between mean PD and mean attachment loss (P < 0. 01), PISA, IL- 1 α and PESA (P < 0. 01), PISA and IL- 1 α levels (P < 0. 01) which was statistically significant.
