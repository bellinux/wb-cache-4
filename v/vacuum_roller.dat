40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was prompted by}} results of a qualification test of a mechanism {{to be used for}} the James Webb Space Telescope. Post-test inspections of the qualification test article revealed some loose wear debris and wear of the steel rollers and the mating Ti 6 Al 4 V surfaces. An engineering assessment of the design and observations from the tested qualification unit suggested that roller misalignment was a controlling factor. The wear phenomena were investigated using dedicated laboratory experiments. Tests were done using a <b>vacuum</b> <b>roller</b> rig for a range of roller misalignment angles. The wear in these tests was mainly adhesive wear. The measured wear rates were highly correlated to the misalignment angle. For all tests with some roller misalignment, the steel rollers lost mass while the titanium rollers gained mass indicating strong adhesion of the steel with the titanium alloy. Inspection of the rollers revealed that the adhesive wear was a two-way process as titanium alloy was found on the steel rollers and vice versa. The qualification test unit made use of 440 F steel rollers in the annealed condition. Both annealed 440 F steel rollers and hardened 440 C rollers were tested in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>roller</b> rig to investigate possibility to reduce wear rates and the risk of loose debris formation. The 440 F and 440 C rollers had differing wear behaviors with significantly lesser wear rates for the 440 C. For the test condition of zero roller misalignment, the adhesive wear rates were very low, but still some loose debris was forme...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} {{motivated}} by a qualification test of a mechanism for a space telescope. During the test undesired wear debris was formed. In this project alterative materials and coatings were tested with intent to reduce wear and debris when steel has a misaligned rolling contact against Ti 6 Al 4 V. Testing was done using a <b>vacuum</b> <b>roller</b> rig mimicking the mechanism's contact conditions. Ten configurations were tested. Most configurations resulted in significant debris. A sputtered 1 -micrometer-thick nan-ocomposite molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) film provided the best wear protection. The best configuration made use of the MoS 2 coating on both materials, and in preparing for sputtering the anodized Ti 6 Al 4 V working surface was smoothed using an ultrasonic process...|$|E
40|$|The International Space Station's {{starboard}} Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ) {{experienced a}} breakdown of the joint's race ring surface. The starboard SARJ mechanism was cleaned and lubricated with grease. To provide some guidance on the expected behavior of the damaged SARJ ring with continued operations, experiments were conducted using rollers and a <b>vacuum</b> <b>roller</b> test rig. The approach of the experimental work involved three main steps: (1) initiate damage using conditions representative of the SARJ with inadequate lubrication; (2) propagate the damage by operating the test rollers without lubrication; and (3) assess the durability of the roller by testing to simulate the equivalent of 15 years of SARJ operation on the damaged surface assuming adequate grease lubrication. During the rig testing, additional and/or replacement grease was introduced at regular intervals to maintain good lubrication in the rig. The damage to the nitride layer continued even after application of grease. The grease lubrication proved to be effective for limiting the value of the axial force that can be developed. Limiting the axial force on the SARJ mechanism is important since the larger the axial force the more concentrated the load pressure becomes on the blend-radius location on the SARJ roller. After the testing simulating 15 years of SARJ operations, the wear depths were the order of 0. 2 mm for the nitrided 15 - 5 roller and the order of 0. 06 mm for the mating 440 C roller. Metallographic inspections were done to search for indications of impending fatigue or other fracture indications that might eventually propagate and cause structural failure. There were no indications or features found that could eventually compromise structural integrity...|$|E
50|$|A release agent, {{usually in}} either wax or liquid form, {{is applied to}} the chosen mold to allow {{finished}} product to be cleanly removed from the mold. Resin—typically a 2-part thermoset polyester, vinyl or epoxy—is mixed with its hardener and applied to the surface. Sheets of fiberglass matting are laid into the mold, then more resin mixture is added using a brush or roller. The material must conform to the mold, and air must not be trapped between the fiberglass and the mold. Additional resin is applied and possibly additional sheets of fiberglass. Hand pressure, <b>vacuum</b> or <b>rollers</b> are used to be sure the resin saturates and fully wets all layers, and that any air pockets are removed. The work must be done quickly, before the resin starts to cure, unless high temperature resins are used which will not cure until the part is warmed in an oven. In some cases, the work is covered with plastic sheets and vacuum is drawn on the work to remove air bubbles and press the fiberglass to the shape of the mold.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the plantar forefoot offloading efficacy of a new prefabricated vacuum-cushioned cast replacement system designed for foot ulcer treatment in neuropathic diabetic patients. Methods: Fifteen diabetic subjects with peripheral neuropathy underwent in-shoe plantar pressure assessment while walking in five different footwear types: a standard vacuum-cushioned system with instantly moldable <b>vacuum</b> cushion and <b>roller</b> outsole, two modified vacuum-cushioned systems, one with flat surface vacuum cushion and one with flat outsole, a forefoot offloading shoe, and a control shoe. Regional peak pressures, pressure-time integrals, and inter-regional load transfers were calculated to determine the mechanical action of the footwear. Perceived walking comfort was tested using a 10 -point visual analogue scale. Findings: Forefoot peak pressures and pressure-time integrals were significantly lower (by 41 - 56 %) in the vacuum-cushioned system compared to control. Compared to the forefoot offloading shoe, the vacuum-cushioned system showed significantly higher metatarsal head peak pressures, similar metatarsal head pressure-time integrals, and significantly lower hallux peak pressures and pressure-time integrals. A major transfer of forefoot load to the midfoot explained the offloading efficacy of the vacuum-cushioned system. Few significant differences were present between the modified and standard vacuum-cushioned systems. Perceived walking comfort was significantly higher in the vacuum-cushioned system (score 6. 6) than in the forefoot offloading shoe (score 3. 4). Interpretation: The results showed that the vacuum-cushioned cast replacement system was effective in offloading the plantar forefoot of diabetic patients at risk for ulceration, although the contribution of the instantly moldable <b>vacuum</b> cushion and <b>roller</b> outsole were relatively small. The combined peak pressure, pressure-time integral and walking comfort results indicate that the vacuum-cushioned system may be a useful alternative for the forefoot offloading shoe in offloading the plantar diabetic forefoot.

50|$|Lack of {{deliberation}} {{amongst the}} parties {{to be involved in}} a technology may also lead to a rapid pace of innovation mainly due to publicity that a project may gain making it difficult to oppose the original plan leading to the technological momentum in that particular field. For example, the NASA project on space shuttle lead to large publicity of the project which made it more difficult to stop the project when it stated being costly. Lack of deliberation during the decision made to build large nuclear reactors during the 1970s, caused nuclear energy to have a technological momentum. In the case of nuclear power plants, there was also no gradual scale up of the power plants which made it difficult and costly to implement changes after trial and error. Other examples of technology proceeding too quickly are product iterations that occur from the treadmill of consumption. With consumer goods, such as CD players, <b>vacuums,</b> and lint <b>rollers,</b> being produced with such variety that lead to various resource inefficiencies, products are being modified at an unnecessarily rapid pace.|$|R
40|$|CFRP {{sheets are}} {{extensively}} used to strengthen defected steel members through a wet layup process. Different techniques {{were used to}} control the quality of bonding, such as <b>vacuum</b> bags and <b>rollers.</b> However, air bubbles and excessive epoxy resin might still exist between CFRP layers, causing the reduction in bonding strength. To address this issue, strand CFRP sheets were recently applied in the strengthening of steel elements by some researchers. The advantage of strand CFRP sheets is that CFRP fibre was impregnated with resin to form hardened strands at factory conditions. As a result, the bonding quality during the wet layup can be improved. In this study, two types of strand CFRP sheets, with Young's moduli of 430 GPa and 690 GPa, were applied on defected steel beams. Eight specimens were tested under four point bending. The failure modes and fatigue life of the specimens were {{compared with those of}} specimens strengthened with normal CFRP sheets and CFRP plates. Results showed that the fatigue life of defected steel beams strengthened with high and medium strand CFRP sheets is comparable to that of beams strengthened with CFRP plates and other high modulus CFRP sheets...|$|R
