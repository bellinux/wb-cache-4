The results demonstrated that endothelium-lined vessels dominated the tumor microvasculature and these stained positively for PAS, laminin, and endothelial markers. Mosaic and tumor-lined vessels were infrequently encountered.

40|$|Recovery of endothelial {{integrity}} after {{vascular injury}} {{is vital for}} endothelial barrier function and vascular homeostasis. However, {{little is known about}} the molecular mechanisms of endothelial barrier repair following injury. To investigate the functional role of forkhead box M 1 (FoxM 1) in the mechanism of endothelial repair, we generated endothelial cell–restricted FoxM 1 -deficient mice (FoxM 1 CKO mice). These mutant mice were viable and exhibited no overt phenotype. However, in response to the inflammatory mediator LPS, FoxM 1 CKO mice displayed significantly protracted increase in lung vascular permeability and markedly increased mortality. Following LPS-induced vascular injury, FoxM 1 CKO lungs demonstrated impaired cell proliferation in association with sustained expression of p 27 Kip 1 and decreased expression of cyclin B 1 and Cdc 25 C. Endothelial cells isolated from FoxM 1 CKO lungs failed to proliferate, and siRNA-mediated suppression of FoxM 1 expression in human endothelial cells resulted in defective cell cycle progression. Deletion of FoxM 1 in endothelial cells induced decreased expression of cyclins, Cdc 2, and Cdc 25 C, increased p 27 Kip 1 expression, and decreased Cdk activities. Thus, FoxM 1 plays a critical role in the mechanism of the restoration of endothelial barrier function following vascular injury. These data suggest that impairment in FoxM 1 activation may be an important determinant of the persistent <b>vascular</b> barrier <b>leakiness</b> and edema formation associated with inflammatory diseases...|$|R
40|$|Repair of {{the injured}} {{vascular}} intima requires a series of coordinated events that mediate both endothelial regeneration and reannealing of adherens junctions (AJs) to form a restrictive endothelial barrier. The forkhead transcription factor FoxM 1 is essential for endothelial proliferation after vascular injury. However, {{little is known about}} mechanisms by which FoxM 1 regulates endothelial barrier reannealing. Here, using a mouse model with endothelial cell (EC) -restricted disruption of FoxM 1 (FoxM 1 CKO) and primary cultures of ECs with small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated knockdown of FoxM 1, we demonstrate a novel requisite role of FoxM 1 in mediating endothelial AJ barrier repair through the transcriptional control of β-catenin. In the FoxM 1 CKO lung vasculature, we observed persistent microvessel leakage characterized by impaired reannealing of endothelial AJs after endothelial injury. We also showed that FoxM 1 directly regulated β-catenin transcription and that reexpression of β-catenin rescued the defective AJ barrier–reannealing phenotype of FoxM 1 -deficient ECs. Knockdown of β-catenin mimicked the phenotype of defective barrier recovery seen in FoxM 1 -deficient ECs. These data demonstrate that FoxM 1 is required for reannealing of endothelial AJs in order to form a restrictive endothelial barrier through transcriptional control of β-catenin expression. Therefore, means of activating FoxM 1 -mediated endothelial repair represent a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of inflammatory vascular diseases associated with persistent <b>vascular</b> barrier <b>leakiness</b> such as acute lung injury...|$|R

The role of tumor-secreted C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain of angiopoietin-like 4 (cANGPTL 4) in <b>vascular</b> <b>leakiness</b> and metastasis is controversial {{because of the}} lack of understanding of how cANGPTL 4 modulates vascular integrity. Here, we show that cANGPTL 4 instigated the disruption of endothelial continuity by directly inter-acting with 3 novel binding partners, integrin alpha 5 beta 1, VE-cadherin, and claudin- 5, in a temporally sequential manner, thus facilitating metastasis. We showed that cANGPTL 4 binds and activates integrin alpha 5 beta 1 -mediated Rac 1 /PAK signaling to weaken cell-cell contacts. cANGPTL 4 subsequently associated with and declustered VE-cadherin and claudin- 5, leading to endothelial disruption. Interfering with the formation of these cANGPTL 4 complexes delayed vascular disruption. In vivo vascular permeability and metastatic assays performed using ANGPTL 4 -knockout and wild-type mice injected with either control or ANGPTL 4 -knockdown tumors confirmed that cANGPTL 4 induced <b>vascular</b> <b>leakiness</b> and facilitated lung metastasis in mice. Thus, our findings elucidate how cANGPTL 4 induces endothelial disruption. Our findings have direct implications for targeting cANGPTL 4 to treat cancer and other vascular pathologies.

It {{is important to understand}} the effects of these factors on the detailed drug distribution in the entire tumor for an effective treatment. In this study, we developed a small-scale mathematical model to systematically study the spatiotemporal responses and accumulative exposures of macromolecular carriers in localized tumor tissues. We chose various dextrans as model carriers and studied the effects of vascular density, permeability, diffusivity, and half-life of dextrans on their spatiotemporal concentration responses and accumulative exposure distribution to tumor cells. The relevant biological parameters were obtained from experimental results previously reported by the Dreher group. The area under concentration-time response curve (AUC) quantified the extent of tissue exposure to a drug and therefore was considered more reliable in assessing the extent of the overall drug exposure than individual concentrations. The results showed that 1) a small macromolecule can penetrate deep into the tumor interstitium and produce a uniform but low spatial distribution of AUC; 2) large macromolecules produce high AUC in the perivascular region, but low AUC in the distal region away from vessels; 3) medium-sized macromolecules produce a relatively uniform and high AUC in the tumor interstitium between two vessels; 4) enhancement of permeability can elevate the level of AUC, but have little effect on its uniformity while enhancement of diffusivity is able to raise the level of AUC and improve it...|$|R

Although malignant ascites is known to be the result of vascular dysfunction, current approved treatments are not effective in stopping its accumulation. This study took on an alternative strategy of targeting the macrophage functions to reverse the vascular pathology of malignant ascites. We analyzed the content of immune cells and macrophages in ascites fluid of human patients and in a murine immunocompetent model (ID 8) of EOC. This model developed progressive <b>vascular</b> disorganization and <b>leakiness</b> that culminated in massive ascites, mirroring the human disease. The macrophage content in ascites fluid from human patients and ID 8 model directly correlates with vascular permeability. To further substantiate macrophages’ role in the pathogenesis of malignant ascites, a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF 1 R) kinase inhibitor (GW 2580) was used to block the functions of macrophages in the ID 8 model. GW 2580, administered in the late stages, was able to reduce the number of protumorigenic (M 2) macrophages infiltrating the ascites and lower ascites volume dramatically. Disorganized peritoneal vasculature became normalized and vascular permeability assays showed that GW 2580 -treated ascites sera protected against endothelium permeability. Because these results were seen with just ascites sera, the conclusion was that soluble factors in the ascites are responsible, at least in part, for the regulation of the peritoneal vasculature in late-stage EOC. Preliminary mass spectrometry analysis revealed some interesting cadidates including apolipoproteins, CD 5 antigen-like, glutathione peroxidase, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chains. Future directions focus on identifying these factors.

They exhibit a remarkable ability to adapt rapidly to biomechanical and biochemical stimuli from their microenvironment. Vascular endothelial cells play an essential role during the onset of inflammatory conditions and sepsis. Sepsis accounts for {{the highest number of}} mortalities in non-cardiac intensive care units and is linked to numerous other underlying conditions including cancer, inflammatory conditions and diabetes. Cancer patients, in particular, are especially susceptible to infections that lead to sepsis and show significantly higher mortality rates due to the immunocompromised nature of the host defense system. Currently, there are no available treatments for sepsis. Furthermore, TNFα has been implicated as one of the major proinflammatory cytokines in sepsis. In the current work, we used physiologically relevant shear stress rates and translated them into a well-controlled in vitro system applying fluid shear stress onto primary endothelial microvascular endothelial cells. We identified a complex formed by the active form of the small GTPase R-Ras and the cytoskeletal scaffold protein filamin A (FLNa) that can regulate TNFα-mediated activation of endothelial cells under fluid shear stress conditions. R-Ras binds directly to repeat 3 of FLNa forming a complex that is necessary for endothelial barrier integrity. We show here that activated GTP-bound R-Ras blocks vascular permeability. Permeability is monitored using the electrical cell impedance spectroscopy (ECIS) method that acquires real-time transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) values. From the electrical resistance, impedance and capacitance, endothelial permeability can be derived by employing the ECIS model and quantified at nanoscale precision levels concurrently with endothelial cells subjected to fluid shear stress. We also demonstrate a novel platform comprised of ECIS and physiologically relevant fluid shear stress levels to test novel inhibitors or compounds that block TNFα-mediated vascular permeability. Thus, we show that the R-Ras/FLNa complex is important in regulating vascular endothelial permeability under fluid shear stress conditions.

Convincing too is the evidence that surgery to remove the primary tumor often terminates dormancy resulting in accelerated relapses.

In this study, we investigated whether the combination of PDGFR and VEGFR inhibitors could further reduce the IFP of KAT- 4 human carcinoma tumors. The tumor IFP was measured using the wick-in-needle technique. The combination of STI 571 and PTK/ZK gave an additive effect on the lowering of the IFP of KAT- 4 tumors, but the timing of the treatment was crucial.

METHODS: Experiments were performed on rats with antigen induced arthritis (AIA). Regional blood flows (RBF) were measured with the microsphere technique, glucose metabolism by determination of [14 C] 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (2 -DG) uptake, and the proliferative response as the incorporation of [3 H]-thymidine. RESULTS: In periarticular soft tissue of the arthritic knee the only {{significant change in the}} weight related RBF was an approximate 70 % rise on Day 14 after arthritis onset. The RBF was lowest on Day 3 and the time course for the changes was inversely related to intensity of vascular inflammation. Weight related 2 -DG uptake was more elevated than the RBF and peaked on Day 3. [3 H]-thymidine incorporation in the soft tissue was only markedly enhanced on Day 3. Neither 2 -DG nor [3 H]-thymidine uptake was affected by treatment with methotrexate or indomethacin. In epiphyseal bone RBF was reduced {{on the first day of}} arthritis, but steadily increased thereafter.

We prospectively assessed the vascular changes accompanying worsening of asthma control by using an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose-reduction model. Objectives: To evaluate airway vascularity, vascular permeability and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in early asthma deterioration induced by ICS back-titration. Methods: Twenty mild-to-moderate persistent symptomatic asthmatics on low-to-moderate ICS were recruited and treated with 4 weeks of high-dose fluticasone propionate (1000 μg/day) to achieve symptom control. This was followed by dose reduction to half of the pre-study doses for 4 – 8 weeks until the symptoms began to return. Endobronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were obtained after both treatment periods. Results: Vascularity {{as measured by the}} number and size of blood vessels, as well as VEGF expression did not change following ICS reduction. Even on high-dose ICS, perivascular albumin staining and BAL microalbumin levels in asthmatic subjects, as markers of permeability, were elevated when compared with normal subjects and both further increased significantly after ICS reduction. There was a significant association between changes in <b>vascular</b> <b>leakiness</b> and clinical deterioration. Increases in airway albumin correlated with previously reported increases in airway wall infiltration with T lymphocytes.

Therefore, agents that enhance EC barrier integrity have important therapeutic implications. We observed that binding of high-molecular-weight hyaluronan (HMW-HA) to its cognate receptor CD 44 within caveolin-enriched microdomains (CEM) enhances human pulmonary EC barrier function. Immunocytochemical {{analysis indicated that}} HMW-HA promotes redistribution of a significant population of CEM to areas of cell-cell contact. Quantitative proteomic analysis of CEM isolated from human EC demonstrated HMW-HA-mediated recruitment of cytoskeletal regulatory proteins (annexin A 2, protein S 100 -A 10, and filamin A/B). Inhibition of CEM formation [caveolin- 1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and cholesterol depletion] or silencing (siRNA) of CD 44, annexin A 2, protein S 100 -A 10, or filamin A/B expression abolished HMW-HA-induced actin cytoskeletal reorganization and EC barrier enhancement. To confirm our in vitro results in an in vivo model of inflammatory lung injury with vascular hyperpermeability, we observed that the protective effects of HMW-HA on LPS-induced pulmonary <b>vascular</b> <b>leakiness</b> were blocked in caveolin- 1 knockout mice. Furthermore, targeted inhibition of CD 44 expression in the mouse pulmonary vasculature significantly reduced HMW-HA-mediated protection from LPS-induced hyperpermeability.

Here {{we show that}} basal and angiopoietin- 1 (Ang- 1) –regulated control of EC permeability is mediated by 2 different functional states of sphingosine kinase- 1 (SK- 1). Mice depleted of SK- 1 have increased <b>vascular</b> <b>leakiness,</b> whereas mice transgenic for SK- 1 in ECs show attenuation of leakiness. Furthermore, Ang- 1 rapidly and transiently stimulates SK- 1 activity and phosphorylation, and induces an increase in intracellular sphingosine- 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) concentration. Overexpression of SK- 1 resulted in inhibition of permeability similar to that seen for Ang- 1, whereas knockdown of SK- 1 by small interfering RNA blocked Ang- 1 -mediated inhibition of permeability. Transfection with SKS 225 A, a nonphosphorylatable mutant of SK- 1, inhibited basal leakiness, and both SKS 225 A and a dominant-negative SK- 1 mutant removed the capacity of Ang- 1 to inhibit permeability. These effects were independent of extracellular S 1 P as knockdown or inhibition of S 1 P 1, S 1 P 2, or S 1 P 3, {{did not affect the}} Ang- 1 response.

The mechanosensitive transcription factor TWIST is expressed during embryogenesis but {{its role in}} EC responses to shear stress and focal atherosclerosis is unknown. OBJECTIVE: Investigate whether TWIST regulates endothelial responses to shear stress during vascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis, and compare TWIST function in vascular development and disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: The expression and function of TWIST 1 was studied in EC in both developing vasculature and during the initiation of atherosclerosis. In zebrafish, twist was expressed in early embryonic vasculature where it promoted angiogenesis by inducing EC proliferation and migration. In adult porcine and murine arteries, TWIST 1 was expressed preferentially at low shear stress regions as evidenced by qPCR and en face staining. Moreover, studies of experimental murine carotid arteries and cultured EC revealed that TWIST 1 was induced by low shear stress via a GATA 4 -dependent transcriptional mechanism. Gene silencing in cultured EC and EC-specific genetic deletion in mice demonstrated that TWIST 1 promoted atherosclerosis by inducing inflammation and enhancing EC proliferation associated with <b>vascular</b> <b>leakiness.</b> CONCLUSIONS: TWIST expression promotes developmental angiogenesis by inducing EC proliferation and migration. In addition to its role in development, TWIST is expressed preferentially at low shear stress regions of adult arteries where it promotes atherosclerosis by inducing EC proliferation and inflammation.

Angiopoietin/Tie 2 signaling can reduce the leakiness through changes in endothelial cells. The role of pericytes in this action has been unknown. We used the selective PDGF-B-blocking oligonucleotide aptamer AX 102 to determine whether disruption of pericyte-endothelial crosstalk alters <b>vascular</b> <b>leakiness</b> or remodeling in the airways of mice under four different conditions: i) baseline, ii) acute inflammation induced by bradykinin, iii) sustained inflammation after 7 -day infection by the respiratory pathogen Mycoplasma pulmonis, or iv) leakage after bradykinin challenge {{in the presence of}} vascular stabilization by the angiopoietin- 1 (Ang 1) mimic COMP-Ang 1 for 7 days. AX 102 reduced pericyte coverage but did not alter the leakage of microspheres from tracheal blood vessels at baseline or after bradykinin; however, AX 102 exaggerated leakage at 7 days after M. pulmonis infection and increased vascular remodeling and disease severity at 14 days. AX 102 also abolished the antileakage effect of COMP-Ang 1 at 7 days. Together, these findings show that pericyte contributions to endothelial stability have greater dependence on PDGF-B during the development of sustained inflammation, when pericyte dynamics accompany vascular remodeling, than under baseline conditions or in acute inflammation. The findings also show that the antileakage action of Ang 1 requires PDGF-dependent actions of pericytes in maintaining endothelial stability. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Exosomes from highly metastatic melanomas increased the metastatic behavior of primary tumors by permanently 'educating' bone marrow progenitors through the receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Melanoma-derived exosomes also induced <b>vascular</b> <b>leakiness</b> at pre-metastatic sites and reprogrammed bone marrow progenitors toward a pro-vasculogenic phenotype that was positive for c-Kit, the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie 2 and Met.

Here, we define the characteristics of bone marrow NEMs and assess whether these cells might represent an exploitable tool to induce tumor vessel maturation. Gene expression signature and surface marker analysis have indicated that NEMs represent a specific subset of CD 11 b+ Nrp 1 + Gr 1 - resident monocytes, distinctively recruited by Sema 3 A. NEMs were found to produce several factors involved in vessel maturation, including PDGFb, TGF-β, thrombospondin- 1, and CXCL 10; consistently, they were chemoattractive for vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro. When directly injected into growing tumors, NEMs, isolated either from the bone marrow or from Sema 3 A-expressing muscles, exerted antitumor activity despite having no direct effects on the proliferation of tumor cells.

The influence of a single dose of indomethacin and methotrexate (MTX) on these measures was also determined. METHODS: Vascular inflammatory activity was assessed as extravasation of radiolabelled albumin. Synovial hyperplasia was followed by measurements of the increases in wet and dry weight of the anterior part of the periarticular soft tissue and by routine histology. RESULTS: The vascular inflammation peaked on Day 3 after antigen challenge. The pannus weight increased at a slower pace, peaking on Day 7. No major difference between the sexes was found in these responses. Both variables were attenuated by MTX or indomethacin, suggesting a dependence between them. The water content of the pannus increased {{in tandem with the}} tissue growth but did not correlate to <b>vascular</b> <b>leakiness,</b> and is thus explained by the structural properties of the pannus rather than by the formation of inflammatory edema.

The knee diameter, which is the most commonly used clinical measurement, seems mainly to be a reflection of the former variable.

Amyloid peptides {{are known to}} induce oxidative stress. Impairment of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH 2) following oxidative stress, results in accumulation of toxic aldehydes, particularly 4 -hydroxynoneal (4 -HNE). We sought to determine the role of mithocondrial ALDH 2 in Aβ-related impairment of angiogenesis. We hypothesized that by increasing the detoxification activity of ALDH 2, we would reduce Aβ-driven endothelial injuries and restore angiogenesis. We used a selective ALDH 2 activator, Alda- 1, assessing its ability to repair mithocondrial dysfunction in the endothelium. Treatment of human endothelial cells with Aβ 1 - 40 (5 - 50 µM), induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased cytochrome c release and ROS accumulation. These events were associated with 4 -HNE accumulation and decrease in ALDH 2 activity (40 %), and resulted in disassembly of endothelial junctions, as evidenced by β-catenin phosphorylation, disorganization of adherens and tight junctions, and by disruption of pseudocapillary formation. Alda- 1 (10 - 40 µM) abolished Aβ-induced 4 -HNE accumulation, apoptosis, and <b>vascular</b> <b>leakiness,</b> fully restoring the pro-angiogenic endothelial phenotype and responses to FGF- 2. Our data document that mitochondrial ALDH 2 in endothelium is a target for the vascular effect of Aβ including loss of barrier function and angiogenesis.

Thus, agents activating ALDH 2 may reduce endothelial injuries including those occurring in cerebral amyloid angiopathy, preserving the angiogenic potential of the endothelium...|$|E
40|$|The {{assembly}} of adherens junctions (AJs) is re-quired for maintenance of normal endothelial barrier function, whereas disassembly {{in response to}} a variety of inflammatory mediators induces vascular barrier leakiness and transendothelial migration of inflammatory cells, leading to in-flammation (Dejana et al., 2008; Komarova and Malik, 2010). Endothelial permeability is essen-tial for the pathogenesis of acute and chronic in-flammation underlying many diseases (Komarova et al., 2007), including atherosclerosis (Correale and Villa, 2007), cancer (Kim et al., 2009), and acute lung injury (Komarova et al., 2007). The understanding of signaling pathways that orches-trate the assembly and dis{{assembly of}} AJs is re-quired to provide insights into the molecular regulation of endothelial permeability and the potential ability to control excessive <b>vascular</b> <b>leakiness.</b> Catenins are the primary VE-cadherin binding partners, and they determine the stabil-ity of AJs (Komarova and Malik, 2010). c-Src– dependent phosphorylation of VE-cadherin at Tyr 658 induced uncoupling of p 120 -catenin from VE-cadherin, resulting in internalization of VE-cadherin from AJs and subsequent loss of en-dothelial barrier function (Xiao et al., 2003; Potter et al., 2005; Hatanaka et al., 2011). Expression of constitutively active Src, but not the dominant negative c-Src tyrosine kinase (CSK), a negative regulator of c-Src (Okada et al., 1991; Cole et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2009), also increased endo-thelial permeability (Adam et al., 2010). G 13, the G 12 subfamily member of heterotrimeric G proteins, like other G proteins, responds to GPCR activation by interacting with down-stream effectors (Kozasa et al., 1998; Brown et al., 2006). G 13 has been shown to regulate the processes of cell differentiation, retraction, mi-gration, and platelet shape change, as well as endothelial permeability, through RhoA activa...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} was carried out to test the {{potential}} of a new nanomaterial (Spago Pix) as a macromolecular magnetic MR contrast agent for tumor detection and to verify the presence of nanomaterial in tumor tissue. Spago Pix, synthesized by Spago Nanomedical AB, is a nanomaterial with a globular shape, an average hydrodynamic diameter of 5 nm, and a relaxivity (r 1) of approximately 30 (mM Mn) - 1 s- 1 (60 MHz). The material consists of an organophosphosilane hydrogel with strongly chelated manganese (II) ions and a covalently attached PEG surface layer. In vivo MRI of the MMTV-PyMT breast cancer model was performed on a 3 T clinical scanner. Tissues were thereafter analyzed for manganese and silicon content using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The presence of nanomaterial in tumor and muscle tissue was assessed using an anti-PEG monoclonal antibody. MR imaging of tumor-bearing mice (n =  7) showed a contrast enhancement factor of 1. 8 (tumor versus muscle) at 30 minutes post-administration. Contrast was retained and further increased 2 - 4 hours after administration. ICP-AES and immunohistochemistry confirmed selective accumulation of nanomaterial in tumor tissue. A blood pharmacokinetics analysis showed that the concentration of Spago Pix gradually decreased over the first hour, which was in good agreement with the time frame in which the accumulation in tumor occurred. In summary, we demonstrate that Spago Pix selectively enhances MR tumor contrast in a clinically relevant animal model. Based on the generally higher <b>vascular</b> <b>leakiness</b> in malignant compared to benign tissue lesions, Spago Pix {{has the potential to}} significantly improve cancer diagnosis and characterization by MRI...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} tumors and their {{response}} to treatment are determined by delivery of diffusible substances to cancer cells and hence by their blood supply. Relative to most normal tissues, tumor blood flow is highly heterogeneous. Several hypotheses have been postulated to explain this anomalous behavior of tumor microcirculation, but the underlying mechanisms for these heterogeneities are not fully understood. In this study we consider a potential source of nonuniformity in the blood flow: the enhanced fluid exchange between the vascular and interstitial space mediated by the high leakiness of tumor vessels {{which could lead to}} a coupling between vascular, transvascular, and interstitial fluid flow. A simple network model is presented to describe the basic features of now through a network of permeable and compliant vessels embedded in an isotropic porous medium. Two vascular geometries are considered: a regular mesh of identical vessels and a pair of countercurrent vessels of equal diameter. In each case, the now through each vessel of the network is described by Poiseuille's law; the transmural flow between the vessels and the external porous medium is governed by Starling's law; the fluid movement through the porous medium is described by Darcy's law; and the vessel wall is assumed to be elastic. Our results show that the behavior of microcirculation may be strongly modified as a result of vascular compliance and enhanced <b>vascular</b> <b>leakiness</b> of tumor vessels. We found not only that the vascular pressure generates the well-known, high central interstitial fluid pressure, but also that the elevated interstitial pressure in turn alters the vascular pressure distribution. These changes in vascular pressure distribution result in a modification of the blood flow pattern. As the leakiness and compliance of the vessels increase, the blood is diverted away {{from the center of the}} tumor to a more peripheral path. The clinical significance of these results is that drug delivery for chemotherapy and oxygenation needed for radiotherapy may well be hampered in the central region of the tumor, despite the presence of highly permeable vessels in these regions...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} bypass most {{cellular}} barriers {{to gain access}} to intracellular compartments has great potential in cell biology. The possibilities range from efficient delivery of macromolecules such as plasmids to small proteins and oligonucleotides that are sensitive to degradation. In biomedicine, easy access means enhanced cellular imaging and delivery of many therapeutics currently hampered by poor stability and cellular uptake. Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) are attractive in these applications due to their efficient cellular uptake. While mode of entry of CNTs into cells is debatable, possibly their natural shape allows for their selective penetration across biological barriers in a non-destructive way, making them versatile as membrane permeating particles. The present study explores the diverse functionalities of CNTs including: 1) Efficient delivery of DNA into HeLa cells using vertically aligned MWNT arrays, 2) The use of Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWNTs) as nano detoxifiers and 3) the design of SWNTs for efficient cellular uptake. 	Generally, vertically aligned nanoneedles have been used to influence the behavior and differentiation of various cell types. In the first work described in chapter 2, periodic high-density array MWNT nanoneedles is shown to support cell growth and penetrate into HeLa cells, making it ideal for use in cellular imaging and the efficient delivery of plasmid DNA into cells. Most importantly, we show that transfection with the MWNT substrate exhibited more uniformity in comparison to the commercially available lipofection procedure. Lipofection involves the formation of a complex of DNA and cationic lipids that interact with the cell via electrostatic interactions, leading to internalization, DNA escape into the cytosol, and the eventual transport into the nucleus. 	Functionalized CNTS have demonstrated great biocompatibility and potential for drug delivery in vitro. In the work described in chapter 3, we synthesized acid-oxidized and non-covalently PEGlyated SWNTs, which were reported previously for drug delivery purposes, and explored their potential for detoxification in the bloodstream. We investigated the binding of SWNTs to a pore-forming toxin pyolysin. The SWNTs were found to prevent toxin-induced pore formation in the cell membrane of human red blood cells. Quantitative hemolysis assay and scanning electron microscopy were used to evaluate the inhibition of hemolytic activity of pyolysin. Unlike HeLa cells, human red blood cells did not internalize oxidized SWNTs according to Raman spectroscopy data. Molecular modeling and circular dichroism measurements were used to predict the 3 D structure of pyolysin (domain 4) and its interaction with SWNTs. The Tryptophan-rich hydrophobic motif in the membrane-binding domain of pyolysin, a common construct in a large family of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs), showed high affinity for SWNTs. In the final two chapters, chapters 4 and 5, we focused on shorter CNTs (< 70 nm) that have less length variations. This enabled the determination of several length related characteristics such as cellular uptake and distribution of SWNTs within between cells. Here, cellular uptake of two water-soluble SWNTs, Short SWNTs (S_SWNTs) and Ultra-Short SWNTs (US_SWNTs), was evaluated against various mammalian cells. Cellular entry of S_SWNTs (chapter 4), similar in dimensions to those reported in the literature, is shown to be affected by their hydrophilic corona and exhibit time-dependent nuclear accumulation. In contrast, US_SWNTs show no dependence of cellular entry on their hydrophilic exterior (chapter 5). Furthermore, intracellular localization and excretion of the US_SWNTs is observed to be cell type-dependent. Results presented in this work show the potential of CNTs as nano detoxifiers. We also use CNTs as vertically aligned nanoneedles and as colloids to efficiently traverse the plasma membrane. While CNTs as nanoneedles show the potential as an efficient means of transfecting mammalian cells, the use of S_SWNTs and US_SWNTs highlight some key observations including the physical and chemical properties (size, surface functionality) and cell type influence on cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking. These findings contribute to the interpretation of SWNT-cell interactions by providing a correlation between CNT length and cellular uptake and also cell type on trafficking of internalized SWNTs.
