25|$|The {{stall warning}} and stall {{recovery}} systems {{were at the}} centre of the inquiry, which examined in some detail their operation and why the flight crew might have over-ridden them. A three-way air pressure <b>valve</b> (<b>part</b> of the stall recovery system) was found to have been one-sixth of a turn out of position, and the locking wire which secured it was missing. Calculations carried out by Hawker Siddeley determined that if the valve was in this position during the flight then the reduction in engine power for the noise abatement procedure could have activated the warning light that indicated low air pressure in the system. The failure indications might have appeared just prior to take-off and could have accounted for the two-minute delay {{at the end of the}} runway. A captain who had flown Papa India on the morning of the accident flight noted no technical problems, and the public inquiry found that the position of the valve had no significant effect on the system.|$|E

40|$|AbstractStop valves are {{commonly}} used as fluid flow control equipments in many engineering applications. Thus it's more and more essential to know the flow characteristic inside the valve. Due to the fast progress of the flow simulation and numerical technique, it becomes possible to observe the flows inside a valve and to estimate {{the performance of a}} valve. This paper presents the researches of the authors in modeling and simulation of the stop valves. The flow system with stop valves is complex structure and has non-linear characteristics, because the construction and the hydraulic phenomena are associated of stop valves. In this paper, three-dimensional numerical simulations were conducted to observe the flow patterns and to measure valve flow coefficient and flow fluctuations when stop valve with different flow rate and uniform incoming velocity were used in a valve system. The spectra characteristics of pressure fluctuation on the flow cross section were also presented here to investigate the wake induce of the <b>valve</b> <b>part.</b> These results not only provided people with the access of understanding the flow pattern of the valve with different flow rate, but also were made to determine the methods which could be adopted to improve the performance of the valve. Furthermore, the results of the three-dimensional analysis can be used in the design of low noise and high efficiency valve for industry...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel {{combination}} of a micromachined silicon valve with low dead volume and a bi-stable electromagnetic actuator produced by conventional machining is presented. The silicon <b>valve</b> <b>part,</b> 7 × 7 × 1 mm 3 in dimensions, is a sandwich construction of two KOH etched silicon wafers {{with a layer of}} chemical resistant silicone rubber bonded in between. This middle layer provides the flexibility needed to move the valve boss positioned in the top wafer during valve operation, but also results in improved sealing if the valve is closed. In order to drive the valve, a dedicated bi-stable electromagnetic actuator has been designed by applying a finite element software package. The resulting actuator consists of a spring-biased armature that can move 0. 2 mm up and down in a magnetically soft iron housing, incorporating a permanent magnet and a coil. This large stroke makes the valve particle tolerant. A major advantage of the bi-stable design is that only electrical energy is needed to switch the valve between the open and closed state. The actuator has been manufactured by conventional machining and was attached to the individual silicon valve parts resulting in a valve with a footprint of 7 × 7 mm 2 and a height of 21 mm. The valve showed an open/closed ratio of more than 100 at 0. 1 bar...|$|E

The improvement was giving more advantage in emission but it was lowering the performance of the engine. This project is concentrates to improve the air-fuel mixing in the combustion chamber. The modification is focused on the intake <b>valve</b> <b>part</b> to the new design with added fin. This is to produce the swirl to the flow of the fuel mixture which entering into the combustion chamber and produce the turbulent that will increase the combustion ability. The mix between the fuel and clean air completely could increase efficiency from the burning for the reduce of emissions. The perfect mix was influenced by the swirl air flow into intake flow. The addition of fins on intake valve is expected to be able to increase velocity and the value of the massflow, hence produced more swirl air flow enter into combution chamber. The configuration of the dimension from fins also could become the stage factor from swirl. Because of that the analysis of the form is expected to be able to become a solution to get the form of fins that could give more swirl air flow. This Final Project is discussed concerning the analysis of the problem above through pemodelan use the simulation of the computer by software SolidWork. The use of this SolidWork simulation is very exact because of planning still in the stage conceptual design, so as if being carried out modelling physical, will need the big cost and relative time for quite a long time...|$|E
40|$|Now the {{frequency}} regulation with its well-known advantages {{is becoming more}} popular for using in electric drives. One of these systems is the system of liquid flow stabilization for pumping station of the second flood, which is discussed at the article. There are functional elements of the system: {{the frequency}} converter, the induction motor, pump set, check <b>valve,</b> <b>part</b> of the pipeline between the flow sensors and PID controller. In this case are used PID controller with universal input and RS- 485 OWEN TRM 101. The article tries to solve the main problem, which is to set optimal controller settings. The article presents a mathematical model of the system, built {{on the basis of}} transfer functions. The specific values of the parameters for Bratsk pumping station of the second flood are found. To solve the problem of parametric optimization for control of pumping station authors use a genetic algorithm, which allows us to use different quality criteria. A set of parameters for the genetic algorithm is represented, as well as a method of selection and a method of the transition between generations. The problem of parametric optimization was solved by quadratic integral criterion and by the criterion, composed of direct measures of quality (regulation time and the overshoot). The PID controller optimal values of adjustable parameters were obtained both for considered criteria and for their corresponding transient processes. Comparative analysis of results was produced. When proving the optimality of the obtained settings for the quadratic criterion the proximity of the gradient components of the target functional to zero is demonstrated. In the case of a criterion based on a direct measure of quality, is presented a picture of convergence of adjustable parameters to the same value when run with different starting points. It is presented that the use of a criterion based on a direct measure of quality, can significantly reduce the overshoot with a comparable regulation time. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} beverages, {{particularly}} wine, {{depends largely on}} their microflora. Yeast and bacterial fermentations shape the product flavor profile, and can cause spoilage. Current detection methods for microorganisms are usually either inaccurate, slow, or both. In this project, realtime PCR systems were designed to test wines {{for the presence of}} certain microorganisms. The sampling method during wine production was optimized to ascertain that the microflora in the samples is representative of the whole tank. Four different sampling locations within the vertical axis of stainless steel tanks were tested during both the alcoholic and the malolactic fermentation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Oenococcus oeni were enumerated by plating. The results showed that a representative number of viable cells is obtained by taking a sample from the sampling <b>valve.</b> <b>Part</b> of the actin gene (Act 1) was sequenced {{as the basis for the}} realtime PCR. Detection systems for the three undesirable wine yeasts Brettanomyces bruxellensis, Hanseniaspora uvarum, and Pichia anomala were designed and validated. The extraction methods were optimized to ensure that they were quantitative within a suitable range. The specificity of the detection systems as well at their threshold and range were very satisfactory. The realtime PCR system for B. bruxellensis was used to determine whether there is a quantitative connection between B. bruxellensis contamination and the marker phenols 4 -ethylphenol, 4 -ethylguaiacol, and 4 -ethylcatechol or the subjective sensory impression. The experiments show that although B. bruxellensis does produce the known marker phenols, there is no mathematical correlation between the volatile phenol concentration and cell counts. The influence of sanitation procedures on the occurrence of B. bruxellensis in wineries was investigated using plating and realtime PCR. B. bruxellensis was found in most locations in wineries, including the wines. The inheritance of the teinturier phenotype was studied in a cross segregating for this character. Segregation results suggest that the primary gene controlling berry skin color also controls berry flesh pigmentation. This new detection method is faster, more accurate, and more sensitive than previous microbial and chemical detection methods. Routine testing of beverages would minimize the effects of spoilage microorganisms, resulting in decreased product losses for the beverage producers...|$|E

The mitral valve's complex geometry and integration into the left ventricle make repair to the <b>valve's</b> <b>parts</b> more attractive than total {{valve replacement}}. This study investigated the deformations of the mitral valve using mathematical models. The calculated deformation {{will be used to}} optimise bioreactors used in the creation of tissue engineered replacement mitral <b>valve</b> <b>parts.</b> The constitutive make up of the valve was investigated at both the micro-scale using histological techniques and at the macro-scale using uniaxial tensile tests. This investigation showed that collagen fibres were mainly aligned circumferentially and that elastin fibres were aligned both radially and circumferentially in the leaflets which had the effect of making the leaflets less extensible in the circumferential direction. The chordae showed axial collagen fibre alignment with thinner chordae exhibiting less extensibility. The leaflet materials were modelled using a strain energy formulation for two fibre families. This formulation showed a better fit to experimental data for biaxial tests (May- Newman & Yin 1995; Grashow et al 2006) when compared to available constitutive models in LSDYNA. The complex 3 D geometry of the valve was captured using micro-computed tomography in conjunction with geometry extraction codes written in MATLAB (MathWorks) and computer aided design package SolidWorks (Dassault Systeme). The reconstructed geometry highlighted the asymmetrical nature of chordae origins and insertions, along with the asymmetry of the leaflets free edge. The geometry and the constitutive model was brought together in a finite element model. The annular deformation was then modelled using an elastic boundary method to obtain 15 % and 25 % saddle height ratios (SVR). With the 25 % SVR model showing reduced strains in the anterior leaflet at peak systole. Finally the strains for the central regions of the anterior leaflet were compared to the strains generated in a model of a pericardium patch bioreactor. It was shown that the 5 th and 8 th bioreactor settings came closest to replicating the strains reported in the mitral valve finite element models.
