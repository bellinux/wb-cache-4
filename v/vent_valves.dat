50|$|Although the {{operating}} pressure was maintained by an automatically controlled bleed valve once the plant had reached steady state, the valve {{could not be used}} during start-up, when there was no air feed, the plant being pressurised with nitrogen. During start-up the bleed valve was normally isolated and there was no route for excess pressure to escape; pressure was kept within acceptable limits (slightly wider that those achieved under automatic control) by operator intervention (manual operation of <b>vent</b> <b>valves).</b> A pressure-relief valve acting at 11 kg/cm2 (156 psi) gauge was also fitted.|$|E
5000|$|A {{steam heating}} system takes {{advantage}} of the high latent heat which is given off when steam condenses to liquid water. In a steam heating system, each room is equipped with a so-called [...] "radiator" [...] which is connected to a source of low-pressure steam (a boiler). Steam entering the radiator condenses and gives up its latent heat, returning to liquid water. The radiator in turn heats the air of the room, and provides some direct radiant heat. The condensate water returns to the boiler either by gravity or with the assistance of a pump. Some systems use only a single pipe for combined steam and condensate return. Since trapped air prevents proper circulation, such systems have <b>vent</b> <b>valves</b> to allow air to be purged. In domestic and small commercial buildings, the steam is generated at relatively low pressure, less than 15 psig (200 kPa).|$|E
50|$|A design {{weakness}} of earlier classes solved by the Tench re-design were the ballast tank vent riser pipes that {{passed through the}} interior of the boat in the forward and after torpedo rooms. These pipes allowed #1 and #7 Main Ballast Tanks (MBT) (located in the single hull sections of the boat) to vent air during diving and allowing water to flood into them from below. The tops of these tanks formed the walking deck in the interior of both rooms and thus the normal location of the <b>vent</b> <b>valves</b> (the top of the tank) could not be used. The riser pipes allowed the tanks to vent but when the tanks were full these pipes contained water at full submergence pressure inside the torpedo rooms. If these pipes ruptured during depth charge attack, catastrophic flooding would occur. Solving this problem initially proved quite difficult, but ultimately required the complete rearrangement of the ballast tanks. #1 MBT was moved to a location forward {{of the end of the}} pressure hull, thus allowing it to vent directly into the superstructure like the rest of the MBT's. This move eliminated the riser pipes completely. #7 MBT, after stability and buoyancy calculations were run was found to be redundant and was converted to a variable fuel oil tank as mentioned above. These changes forced the rearrangement of the associated piping runs and the location of many of the other tanks. Remarkably, these changes resulted in a boat that was visually almost indistinguishable from the earlier Balao class, with the exception of a sharper angle (or knuckle) at the lower corner of the bow (only visible when the boat was drydocked).|$|E

40|$|Fuel leakage has {{the risk}} of being ignited by {{external}} ignition sources, and therefore it is important to detect any fuel leakage before the departure of the aircraft. Currently, there are no fuel leak detection systems installed on commercial aircrafts, to detect fuel tank leakage, while {{only a small number of}} more recent aircraft, have a fuel monitoring system, that generates a fuel leak-warning message in cockpit in the case of fuel imbalance between the tanks. The approach proposed in this paper requires the fuel vent ports on the wings to be replaced with fuel <b>vent</b> <b>valves,</b> which can be controlled to be in open or close position. The fuel vent valve will be in close position, when certain conditions are fulfilled (all the related fuel valves closed, pumps not operating, etc.), the fuel tank ullage area is then pressurized to 4 psi and the rate of change of the pressure is measured over a period. Several experiments have been conducted and, the result show that a continuous fuel leak of one liter per minute can be detected. Further experiments show that if the fuel tank is pressurized to higher pressures, a fuel leak can be detected sooner...|$|E

40|$|Boric acid is a {{critical}} component in the reactivity control of pressurized water reactors generally being necessary to maintain a plant subcritical. In 1995, the B&W Owner's Group recognized a possible mechanism for the accumulation of low boron concentration coolant (deborate), potentially complicating recovery from certain small break LOCAs. The BWOG established a program to quantify concerns and determine prudent procedure or equipment adjustments. This report is the final report in a series dealing {{with the issue of}} boron dilution. Results of earlier studies and BWOG actions taken are reviewed. Analytical results, developed during the past year, on vent valve performance and long-term SBLOCA recovery are presented. The potential for rapid core reactivity insertion, by restart or bump of the main coolant pumps forcing deborate into the core, is shown to be procedurally restricted to safe conditions. Natural circulation restart is shown to provide insufficient core reactivity insertion rates, removing concerns over core or plant damage. It is demonstrated that <b>vent</b> <b>valves</b> remain open and flowing during both system refill and the restart of natural circulation. Vent valve operation mixes highly borated water with deborate at the downcomer entrance, again mitigating core reactivity insertion concerns. It is concluded that: issues regarding deborate accumulation within the reactor coolant system during small break LOCA are resolved; B&W-designed plants may operate without expectation of difficulties during SBLOCA recovery. iii 47 - 5006624 - 0...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the unique pneumatic test {{requirements for the}} acoustic and shock separation testing of the Second Stage for the new Delta III Rocket at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The testing was conducted in the 45, 000 cu ft (25 -feet wide by 30 -feet deep by 50 -foot high) Acoustic Facility. The acoustic testing required that the liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogen (LH 2) tanks be filled with enough liquid nitrogen (LN 2) to simulate launch fuel masses during testing. The challenge for this test dealt with designing, procuring, and fabricating the pneumatic supply systems for quick assembly while maintaining the purity requirements and minimizing costs. The pneumatic systems were designed to fill and drain the both LOX and LH 2 tanks {{as well as to}} operate the fill/drain and <b>vent</b> <b>valves</b> for each of the tanks. The test criteria for the pneumatic sub-systems consisted of function, cleanliness, availability, and cost. The first criteria, function, required the tanks to be filled and drained in an efficient manner while preventing them from seeing pressures greater than 9 psig which would add a pressure cycle to the tank. An LN 2 tanker, borrowed from another NASA facility, served as the pre-cool and drain tanker. Pre-cooling the tanks allowed for more efficient and cost effective transfer from the LN 2 delivery tankers. Helium gas, supplied from a high purity tube trailer, was used to pressurize the vapor space above the LN 2 pushing it into the drain tanker. The tube trailer also supplied high pressure helium to the vehicle for valve control and component purges. Cleanliness was maintained by proper component selection, end-use particle filtration, and any on-site cleaning determined necessary by testing. In order to meet the availability/cost juggling act, products designed for LOX delivery systems were procured to ensure system compatibility while off the shelf valves and tubing designed for the semiconductor industry were procured for the gas systems...|$|E
40|$|The lateral {{maneuvering}} for Surface Effect Ships (SESs) in low velocities {{is highly}} limited. Due to SESs hull {{shape in the}} bow, {{it is not an}} option to use conventional means to get lateral thrust, such as tunnel- or azimuth-thrusters. SESs is a vessel type that uses large amounts of air to achieve several beneficial purposes. A boarding control system (BCS), for vertical bow motion compensation, is already developed. The air is within an air cushion, enclosed by catamaran hulls, a skirt in the bow and a bag in the aft. The needed air pressure in the cushion depends on the conditions and thus varies. It is normal to use inlet fans which runs with constant RPM, and thus delivers a relative constant amount of air. The air pressure is then governed by the <b>vent</b> <b>valves</b> (VVs), i. e. how much air that is let out trough these. On the model that is used in this master thesis, these VVs was moved to the ship sides, above the water surface. If one has a larger air flow through one side than the other, one will produce a net force. The idea with this study is to map the potential of this force. The VVs are placed amidships so they produce sway force, and thus not produce any yaw rotation. The time usage for the repairs and commissioning was 5 - 6 weeks. The weeks was used for planning, logistics, repairing damages, making of ducts for placing of the VVs on the ship sides amidships, engineering of VVs with opening/closing mechanism, instrumentation and communication between software (Simulink/Veristand) and relevant sensors and actuators. In addition, the model had to be weighted and tipped to find vertical and horizontal center of gravity. All of the model testing in this thesis was conducted in the Towing tank III during 3 weeks and followed this general form: 1) Servo and VV test to check the performance of the servos that opens/closes the VVs. 2) Thrust mapping with gradually opening and closing of VVs to find the corresponding force for each opening. The test was performed for both starboard and port side. 3) Sway Control System (SCS) combined with Boarding Control System (BCS) with head sea. SCS was prioritized over BCS. 4) SCS and BCS combined, BCS was prioritized, but with varying degree throughout the wave series with head sea. 5) SCS and BCS combined, BCS was prioritized, but with varying degree throughout the wave series with head quartering sea. 6) Roll motion tests: the eigenperiode for three different vertical center of gravities was measured. Testing the performance of passive roll damping measures like, bilge keels and flaps placed in the aft of the ship. 7) Active roll damping by dividing the air cushion in the longitudinal direction with a flexible wall. The flexible wall produce two air chambers where the air pressure could be controlled individually, and thus induce a roll motion. Best performance, regarding position error in sway, was observed with SCS in priority. The performance was reduced some when BCS was prioritized over SCS. Although, by reducing the BCS gains the SCS got a more optimal amount of exiting air flow to work with, and the performance was improved dramatically. The optimal working condition for SCS is when the BCS commands half of the total VVs area, i. e. the SCS can direct all exiting air through only one VV. The SCS has throughout the testing period showed promising results, and the recommendation to Umoe Mandal is to implement the SCS on relevant and compatible vessels. Parts of this master thesis will be presented in a paper, (Robust Lateral Control of a Surface Effect Ship using H_∞ Mixed Sensitivity Synthesis), which is approved for the conference: Control Application in Marine Systems (CAMS 2016), in September 2016. During the model testing in the Towing tank III the frequency weighted control law used in the paper was replaced with a PID-controller. The thrust mapping, described in 2) in the section that describes the test regime, was implemented using a second order degree polynomial. The paper is included in appendix . Of the passive roll damping measures, it was the bilge that showed the most promising results. The reason for changing the vertical center of gravity was to test the performance of the vessel with potential future designs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this study, the {{specifications}} {{of the components}} of the vent vale were optimally determined in order to enhance the performance of the <b>vent</b> <b>valve.</b> Design objective was to minimize fuel leakage while satisfying the design constraints on the performance indices. To obtain the optimum solution based on real experiments, several design techniques available in PIAnO, a commercial PIDO tool, were used. First, an orthogonal array was used to generate training design points and then real experiments were performed to measure the experimental data at the training design points. Next, Kriging metamodels for the objective function and design constraints were generated using the experimental data. Finally, a genetic algorithm was employed to obtain the optimization results using the Kriging models.

40|$|A reduced {{dynamical}} model describing {{temperature stratification}} effects driven by natural convection in a liquid hydrogen cryogenic fuel tank has been developed.
