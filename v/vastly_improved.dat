5|$|In case of {{economic}} shocks, policy makers typically {{try to improve}} competitiveness by depreciating the currency, {{as in the case}} of Iceland, which suffered the largest financial crisis in 2008–2011 in economic history but has since <b>vastly</b> <b>improved</b> its position.

5|$|Increased {{experimental}} precision {{combined with}} <b>vastly</b> <b>improved</b> scientific instrumentation was opening up exciting new fields. In 1936 Alexander Oparin (1894–1980) demonstrated a possible {{mechanism for the}} synthesis of organic matter from inorganic molecules. In the 1960s {{it was determined that}} the Earth's earliest life-forms treated as plants, the cyanobacteria known as stromatolites, dated back some 3.5 billion years.|$|E
5|$|First {{the hopeful}} note: There are faint signs the {{tinkering}} with Temperatures format {{could make the}} series funny later on, {{but only if the}} writing improves. The show now leaves most of the mugging to Lynde and no longer insists that each regular is wacky. It's all feeble stuff but the cast is <b>vastly</b> <b>improved</b> and the new approach portends to better things ahead.|$|E

5|$|Six years later, the Voyager {{missions}} <b>vastly</b> <b>improved</b> {{the understanding}} of the Galilean moons and discovered Jupiter's rings. They also confirmed that the Great Red Spot was anticyclonic. Comparison of images showed that the Red Spot had changed hue since the Pioneer missions, turning from orange to dark brown. A torus of ionized atoms was discovered along Io's orbital path, and volcanoes were found on the moon's surface, some in the process of erupting. As the spacecraft passed behind the planet, it observed flashes of lightning in the night side atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The Voyager {{missions}} <b>vastly</b> <b>improved</b> {{our understanding}} of the Galilean moons, and also discovered Jupiter's rings. They also took the first close-up images of the planet's atmosphere, revealing the Great Red Spot as a complex storm moving in a counter-clockwise direction. Other smaller storms and eddies were found throughout the banded clouds (see animation on the right). Two new, small satellites, Adrastea and Metis, were discovered orbiting just outside the ring, making them the first of Jupiter's moons to be identified by a spacecraft. Athird new satellite, Thebe, was discovered between the orbits of Amalthea andIo.|$|E
5|$|As {{the sixth}} {{installment}} to the Dragon Quest series, the graphics and gameplay remain {{close to the}} other games, with minor additions and upgrades. The graphics were <b>vastly</b> <b>improved</b> from , which was also for the SNES, but had rather unimpressive graphics due to being an early game on the console. Navigation remains largely unchanged from the previous games and the turn-based battles are still in first-person. The class system from Dragon Quest III returns, with minor adjustments. The large cartridge ROM used by the game resulted in an extremely high price of 11,970 yen (about 137 dollars), Dragon Quest VI sold 3.2 million copies in Japan, becoming the best selling game of 1995. The DS version sold an additional one million copies by March 2010.|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil was {{developed}} {{over the course of}} one year and two months as part of an exclusivity deal between Capcom and Nintendo. It was directed by Shinji Mikami, who also designed and directed the original Resident Evil. Mikami decided to produce a remake because he felt that the original had not aged well enough and that the GameCube's capabilities could bring it closer to his original vision. The game retains the same graphical presentation, with 3D models superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds. However, the quality of the graphics was <b>vastly</b> <b>improved.</b> The remake also features new gameplay mechanics, revised puzzles, additional explorable areas, a revised script, and new story details including an entire subplot cut from the original game.|$|E
5|$|The Bears defense <b>vastly</b> <b>improved</b> in {{comparison}} to the previous two seasons; after allowing the two most points in franchise history in 2013 (478) and 2014 (442), the 2015 defense allowed 397, which ranked 20th in the league. The defense gained 26 places in the pass defense category to end the season fourth in the ranking. While the unit also allowed only 225 passing yards per game, the number is skewed due to opposing offenses' frequency to run the ball; Bears opponents passed 512, the fourth-least in the NFL. Yardage-wise, the defense allowed an average of 345.1, gaining 16 spots to finish 14th. Statistically, the Bears allowed 7.5 yards per pass and a 62.9 completion percentage, 20th- and 14th-ranked in the league, respectively. The pass defense also allowed a passer rating of 99.2 passer rating (26th), 31 touchdowns (25th), while recording only eight interceptions, the second-least in the NFL. In total, the Bears forced only 17 turnovers (28th-ranked), failing to record one in seven games, and twice in only two games. In the red zone, the Bears allowed 27 touchdowns and 14 field goals on 45 attempts (60 percent), which ranked 21st in the league. Meanwhile, the pass rush recorded 35 sacks (22nd in the NFL), 20 of which occurred in the last seven games of the year, the seventh-most in the league.|$|E

In a post-fight interview, Mir credited his improved striking to a drastic improvement in conditioning.|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{addresses the}} approach to recognize single and multiple human actions in video streams. This work introduces a novel action recognition algorithm with normalization enhancements. Initially feature vectors are extracted using 2 D SIFT features. Bag of Words model is extended with a new normalization technique on the visual vocabulary to make the dimensions same so that the actions {{would be easier to}} read and extract. This normalization technique <b>vastly</b> <b>improves</b> the results from {{the state of the art}} methods. HMM based model is developed for training and testing of six basic actions present in the KTH human action dataset. By comparing our work with previously applied models, results display that our approach <b>vastly</b> <b>improves</b> the accuracy of the existing methods of action recognition...|$|R

25|$|This {{method is}} {{advantageous}} {{in that it}} allows multiple mutations to be introduced into the genome in one experiment. It also has <b>vastly</b> <b>improved</b> efficiency over previous technologies and allows for almost any kind of mutation with ease. These advantages make the CRISPR/Cas9 recombination technique the most promising for application in human health. However, major drawbacks exist, including, most prominently, off-target cleavage that can result in unintended genome disruptions.|$|E

25|$|The {{understanding}} of neuropteran phylogeny has <b>vastly</b> <b>improved</b> since the mid-1990s, {{not the least}} courtesy of the ever-growing fossil record. In 1995, for example, it was simply known that the Megaloptera and Raphidioptera {{were not part of}} the Neuroptera in the strict sense, and the Mantispoidea and part of the Myrmeleontoidea were the only groups that could be confirmed by cladistic analysis. Though the relationships of some families remain to be fully understood, most major lineages of the Neuropterida can nowadays be robustly placed in an evolutionary context.|$|E
