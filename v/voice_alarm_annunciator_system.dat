The lower level faults, which cause the top level alarm, are not visible from the control panel. Moreover, huge amount of maintenance cost and manpower is involved in keeping the system alive. To alleviate these problems, one PC-Based <b>Alarm</b> <b>Annunciator</b> <b>System</b> has been developed using C++ [1] under WIN-NT. A PC plug-in card from ADVANTECH [2] {{is used for the}} Input/Output (I/O) interface. The 64 top level alarms are displayed on the screen using buttons with pre-defined names and different colors are used to indicate the system’s status; e. g. RED for fault, GREEN for O. K. and BLINKING with AUDIO for alarms. Lower level alarms can be displayed with a mouse click on the top-level alarm button. The system keeps records of different parameters with time stamp in a database. The facility to monitor the on-line status of the alarms over the network, through WWW browser is also incorporated. The system is working satisfactorily and will be connected with the main system shortly. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Voice</b> <b>alarm</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in emergency evacuation of public place, because it can provide information and instruct evacuation. This paper studied the optimization of acoustic and semantic parameters of <b>voice</b> <b>alarms</b> in emergency evacuation, so that alarm design can improve the evacuation performance. Both method of magnitude estimation and scale were implemented to investigate participants' perceived urgency of the alarms with different parameters. The results indicated that, participants evaluated the alarms with faster speech rate, with greater signal to noise ratio (SNR) and under louder noises more urgent. There was an interaction between noise level and content of <b>voice</b> <b>alarm.</b> Signals with speech rate below 4 characters / second were evaluated as non urgent at all. Intelligibility of the <b>voice</b> <b>alarm</b> was investigated by evaluating the key pointed recognition performance. The results showed that, speech rate’s effect was a marginal significance, and 7 characters / second has the highest intelligibility. It might because that the faster the signal spoken, the more attention was paid. Gender of speaker and SNR did not have a significant effect on the signals’ intelligibility. This paper also investigated impact of voice alarms' content on human behavior in emergency evacuation in a 3 -D virtual reality environment. In condition of "telling the occupants what had happened and what to do", the number of participants who succeeded in evacuation was the largest. Further study, in which similar numbers of participants evacuate successfully in three conditions, indicated that the reaction time and evacuation time was the shortest in the aforesaid condition. Although one-way ANOVA shows that the difference was not significant, the results still provided some reference to the alarm design. In sum, parameters of <b>voice</b> <b>alarm</b> in emergency evacuation should be chosen to meet needs from both perceived urgency and intelligibility. Contents of the alarms should include "what had happened and what to do", and should vary according to noise levels in different public places. 2008 年奥运会、 2010 年世博会即将在北京、上海举行，届时各比赛场馆、展区等将成为人员密集地区。当紧急情况发生时人员应急疏散将是应对紧急情况中最困难的环节。公共场所应急疏散安全性能很大程度上取决于疏散系统设计，好的系统设计和疏散管理可大大缩短疏散时间、降低可能的经济损失和人员伤亡。以往研究表明，在公共场所的应急疏散中，告警信号和语音告警系统起到重要的传播信息和引导疏散的作用，因此设计有效的告警系统是成功疏散的必要条件。然而语音告警信号的设计比一般的声音信号复杂得多，Wogalter(1999) 提出人们对告警信号进行信息加工的C-HIP模型，将语音告警信号放入该模型可知，信号的产生、信息传递、人们对信号的理解和记忆，以及人们对告警信号产生的信念都将影响信号的效果。 因此本文通过认知工效学实验，研究如何设定合成语音告警信号的声学、语义参数，如何选择信号的内容，可以更好地设计语音告警信号，从而提高疏散的绩效。 用数量估计法和评价量表法对告警信号让人们感知到的紧急性进行研究，结果表明：告警信号语速越快、背景噪声越大、告警信号的信噪比越大，听话人感觉到越紧急。噪声水平和告警信号的内容有交互作用。 4 字/秒的告警信号大多被评价为不紧急，因此应急疏散语音告警信号应避免过低的语速。 用关键词评分法考察声学参数对告警信号可懂度的影响，三因素重复测量方差分析表明，说话人性别、信噪比主效应均不显著。语速对正确率的主效应边缘显著， 7 字/词条件下可懂度最高，这可能与语速快时，被试分配了更多的注意资源有关。 三维模拟场景中对不同内容告警信号条件下疏散行为的观察表明，当告警信号内容为“发生了什么事情和需要做什么”时，成功逃离的人最多。在改进后的实验场景中，三种信号下成功逃离的人数没有显著差异，但此时仍是第二类信号下人们的反应时间和疏散时间最短，虽然单因素方差分析表明这种差异不具有显著性，但这种趋势仍然可以为告警信号的设计提供依据。 综上，应急疏散语音告警信号的声学参数选择应综合考虑可懂度和紧急性两方面，告警信号的内容应包括通知现场人员发生了何种情况以及需要怎样做，并考虑公共场所实际的噪声水平等情况选用信号内容...|$|R

40|$|Fire {{fatality}} {{statistics show}} that being asleep in a residential home is a serious risk factor for death in a fire. These statistics also show that this risk is increased according to individual factors such as being very young, or being {{under the influence of}} alcohol. Research has shown that sleeping children do not reliably respond to a smoke alarm signal (Bruck, 2001). No previous research has investigated the effect of alcohol on the ability to respond from sleep to a smoke alarm. The current project consists of a series of five studies that investigate the response from sleep of vulnerable populations such as children and young adults {{under the influence of alcohol}} to a smoke alarm signal. The purpose of the five studies included: 1. The development and testing of a new signal to be compared to existing manufactured beeping signals in the further studies; 2. Investigating the effect of alcohol on the ability of young adults to respond from deep sleep to three different auditory signals (highpitched Australian Standard Alarm (ASA), a female <b>voice</b> <b>alarm,</b> and a mid-pitched signal in the temporal-three (T- 3) pattern) under three alcohol conditions (sober,. 05 blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and. 08 BAC); 3. Testing several alarms with sleeping children including a message recorded by their mother using the child’s name and stating there was a fire, a female <b>voice</b> <b>alarm,</b> and the T- 3. This was then compared to existing data for the ASA from Bruck & Bliss (2000); 4. Investigating the response of sleeping young adults to a male <b>voice</b> <b>alarm</b> and a high-pitched T- 3 in two alcohol conditions (sober and. 08 BAC); 5. Ivestigating the response of sleeping young adults to naturalistic fire cues including a naturalistic house fire sound, a flickering light, and a combination of the two in two alcohol conditions (sober and. 08 BAC). Major findings from the series of studies include that alcohol significantly affected the ability of sleeping young adults to respond to a smoke alarm, even at. 05 BAC, and that this effect was worse for males than for females. This effect persisted across all studies were alcohol was used, regardless of signal. The response of sleeping children to the ASA (57 %) was significantly poorer than to a <b>voice</b> <b>alarm</b> recorded by their mother (100 %), a female <b>voice</b> <b>alarm</b> (94 %), and the T- 3 (96 %). The male <b>voice</b> <b>alarm</b> and high-pitch T- 3 were both significantly better than the ASA in waking young adults, but methodological concerns may have affected results for the high-pitched T- 3. Finally, light was found to be a poor stimulus in waking people from sleep, and there was no advantage to combining naturalistic stimuli in producing a response. It was concluded that alcohol significantly affects a person’s ability to respond to their smoke alarm signal. Pitch and tonal complexity emerged as potentially important parameters that need to be further explored in relation to smoke alarm signal design...|$|R
