40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the design}} of a <b>varnish</b> <b>plant</b> at Crocodile Matchet Limited, Tema, Ghana was {{considered}} and modification made to eliminate blooming and rusting of its product at the final processing plant when there is high moisture content in the atmosphere. The proposed design included pipelines or ductsand hot air receiving chambers for the <b>Varnish</b> <b>Plant.</b> Heat from the exhaust gas which would have otherwise, gone wasted, was utilised by redesigning the <b>varnish</b> <b>plant</b> and this yielded 6. 74 kW of heat energy which was transferred into the air chambers to aid the drying ofmatchets at the hardening plant. Consequently, the absorption of the moisture on the steel and the dryness of the product were improved. Further studies were done to ensure constant supply of hot air into the air chambers...|$|E
40|$|It was {{the problem}} of partner in project to develop {{catalysts}} with perowskite-type structure for catalytic combustion and catalytic supported combustion of exhaust gases. Exhaust gases: hydrocarbon and chlorinated hydrocarbon. The catalysts should be produced as pellts and as honeycomb. By Leuna the catalyst material was to synthesize, to characterize, to test the activity, to test the resistance against poisons. It have been to show that no dioxine and furane are produced. Results: by the Leuna procedure {{it is possible to}} produce catalysts, which are more active than these produced by other procedures. Catalysts containing lanthanum and cobalt and/or manganese, strontium, iron, copper are able to use both as pellets and for production of honeycomb containing cordierite. Their catalytic activity is comparable with this of noble metal catalysts or is better than this. At combustion of chlorinated hydrocarbon no anything dioxine or furane are formed. Perowskite-type catalysts are not resistant against sulfur compounds. They can be used in processes for removal of harmful gases in exhaust gases, e. g. in <b>varnish</b> <b>plants.</b> (orig.)

50|$|Erebuni {{has a large}} {{industrial}} area at {{the south of the}} district. Many {{large industrial}} plants are operating since the Soviet days. Gajegorts plant for building materials is among the earliest firms opened in the district during the Soviet period. It is operating since 1930. The Yerevan meat processing factory (currently known as Urartu) was opened in 1932. It was followed by the Yerevan <b>varnish</b> and paint <b>plant</b> in 1948. In 1955, the Mixed Fodder factory was opened. In 1965, the Metal structures plant was opened, followed by the Pure iron plant in 1969. In 1990, the Armenuhi-90 Cooperative for chemical products was opened.|$|R
40|$|A Vapour-Phase Bioreactor (VPB), namely a {{biotrickling}} filter, was scaled-up {{and operated}} in-situ {{for the treatment}} of gaseous emissions from a paint and <b>varnish</b> industrial <b>plant.</b> A microbial culture able to degrade the target compounds was enriched and a laboratory-scale VPB was established in order to evaluate the treatment's performance. The VPB presented removal efficiencies higher than 90 % when exposed to Organic Loads (OL) of ca 50 g h− 1 m− 3 of reactor. The VPB was exposed to dynamic conditions often found in-situ (eg night and weekend shutdown periods) and showed a fast capacity to recover, with and without mineral medium recirculation. After a prolonged interruption period (10 months), the VPB was not able to cope with OL of ca 25 g h− 1 m− 3 of reactor and re-inoculation was required in order to recover the treatment performance. The VPB also showed limited treatment when exposed to higher OL (ca 500 g h− 1 m− 3 of reactor). The VPB was then scaled-up and a 3 m 3 VPB was operated in-situ, showing removal efficiencies higher than 50 % when exposed to an OL of c 5 g h− 1 m− 3 of reactor, thus complying with current legal demands. The addition of a maintenance feed was shown to be a useful tool for VPB pilot-scale operation when shutdown periods occurred. A factorial design of experiments was carried out, which allowed reduction to one-tenth of the initial supply of the main mineral medium constituents, namely phosphate buffer, ammonium and magnesium salts, and also elimination of the metal supplement. Overall, the VPBs were shown to be robust equipment, being able to respond actively to dynamic treatment scenarios, particularly night and weekend shutdown periods.

2500|$|Ignacy Ścibor Marchocki of Ostoja (1755–1827) created famous [...] "Kingdom of Mińkowce". Marchocki proclaimed his estates an {{independent}} state and installed on its borders pillars with the name plates, identifying that this is [...] "The border of Minkowce state". The [...] "Kingdom" [...] hold one town, 18 villages and 4 Castles (one for each season) with some 4200 souls living in the [...] "Kingdom". Marchocki liberated peasants from serfdom, granted them a self-government, established jury (court with jury and court of appeal)), built school, pharmacy, orphanage, churches and monuments, cloth and carriage factories, factory of anis apple oil production, with brickyard, <b>varnish</b> and paint <b>plants,</b> with mulberry trees gardens. Its own paper was manufactured there and lime – calcined. He opened his own printing house, where different decrees (like [...] "agreement between the Lord and the peasants"), directions, resolutions and even sermons, later delivered by him in Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches. The government of the Kingdom that included Jews, serfs, town citizens, peasants and foreigners. He also employed two doctors within the property. Central body of the State was the County Court as well as Court of Appeal. The main thing in the State was to give all citizens equal legal rights.|$|R
