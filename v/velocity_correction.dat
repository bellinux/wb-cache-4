50|$|Agni-I is {{a single}} stage, solid fuel, road and rail mobile, medium-range {{ballistic}} missile (MRBM). The need for the Agni-I was felt after the Kargil war with Pakistan. It took DRDO 15 months to develop the Agni-I after having completed Agni-II development. It is propelled by solid fuel. Maneuvering RV body-lift aerodynamics give it the ability to correct trajectory errors and reduce thermal stresses. The MRV has a <b>velocity</b> <b>correction</b> package to correct launch trajectory variances. Some Agni RV versions use a set of solid fueled thruster cartridges of predetermined impulse, allowing the onboard guidance controller to trim velocity, using discrete combination of impulse quanta along the desired spatial orientation. The 15 metre tall Agni-1 missile, weighing about 12 tonnes, is capable of carrying both conventional as well as nuclear warheads of 1,000 kg.Calculations suggest a distance of 1500 km can, theoretically, be reached if the missile were {{to be made of}} composites & carrying a lesser mass of payload.|$|E

The RV is reported to have an attitude control system and aerodynamic manoeuvre fins.

A large inaccuracy associated with the first generation RV involved spinning the RV for greater stability during re-entry. Second generation western missiles were mostly MIRV (Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle) and the accuracy was greatly improved by the payload bus with HAM <b>velocity</b> <b>correction</b> package for more accurate sub-orbit insertion.

The RV re-enters at an altitude of 100 km, at a shallow angle, with a gliding trajectory. However it does not carry a MIRV payload, which is not to be intended to mean that India does not have the technology: the country launched and accurately placed ten satellites in a single launch in 2007, on its PSLV space vehicle, which was the first evidence of the country having revealed its expertise in this arena.|$|E
