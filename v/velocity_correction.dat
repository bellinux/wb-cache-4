50|$|Agni-I is {{a single}} stage, solid fuel, road and rail mobile, medium-range {{ballistic}} missile (MRBM). The need for the Agni-I was felt after the Kargil war with Pakistan. It took DRDO 15 months to develop the Agni-I after having completed Agni-II development. It is propelled by solid fuel. Maneuvering RV body-lift aerodynamics give it the ability to correct trajectory errors and reduce thermal stresses. The MRV has a <b>velocity</b> <b>correction</b> package to correct launch trajectory variances. Some Agni RV versions use a set of solid fueled thruster cartridges of predetermined impulse, allowing the onboard guidance controller to trim velocity, using discrete combination of impulse quanta along the desired spatial orientation. The 15 metre tall Agni-1 missile, weighing about 12 tonnes, is capable of carrying both conventional as well as nuclear warheads of 1,000 kg.Calculations suggest a distance of 1500 km can, theoretically, be reached if the missile were {{to be made of}} composites & carrying a lesser mass of payload.|$|E

Although for <b>velocity</b> <b>correction,</b> approximately 50 to 80 kg is estimated to be sufficient. At least one MRV variant type uses a set of solid fuelled cartridges for velocity trimming. The RV is reported to have an attitude control system and aerodynamic manoeuvre fins. Unlike the Agni-II, the RV of Agni-I does not have fins, indicating use of a new method for RV manoeuvring, presumably to make missile defence more difficult. Reports suggest that an improved optical or radar terminal phase correlation system has been developed to provide accuracy of around 40 meters CEP. The RV largely inherits the basic shape, design and technology of the earlier Mk.1 RV of the Agni-TD.|$|E

50|$|Agni {{is unlike}} {{long-range}} missiles developed by western missiles where the RV is a passive ballistic load, whose accuracy {{depends on the}} launching vehicle's exact insertion into the sub-orbital trajectory. A large inaccuracy associated with the first generation RV involved spinning the RV for greater stability during re-entry. Second generation western missiles were mostly MIRV (Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle) and the accuracy was greatly improved by the payload bus with HAM <b>velocity</b> <b>correction</b> package for more accurate sub-orbit insertion. It also allowed individual MIRV payloads to impart different velocities, so that each can be independently targeted to a different target, albeit in nearby vicinity of each other. As before, the RV continued to be passive and purely ballistic. The Agni-RV Mk 2 is more advanced than the western RVs, because it embodies proposition, navigation and control {{all the way to}} the target. The RV re-enters at an altitude of 100 km, at a shallow angle, with a gliding trajectory. However it does not carry a MIRV payload, which is not to be intended to mean that India does not have the technology: the country launched and accurately placed ten satellites in a single launch in 2007, on its PSLV space vehicle, which was the first evidence of the country having revealed its expertise in this arena.|$|E
