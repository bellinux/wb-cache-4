40|$|Globular {{structured}} oleo alkyds possess low viscosity, good fluidity, {{and play}} an important role in the generation of volatile organic compound (<b>VOC)</b> <b>free</b> paints and coatings. Soya oil (SO), an abundant, inexpensive, renewable, and sustainable material is one of the examples of such oleo alkyd precursors that meets the requirement of green chemistry. The present work reports the synthesis of hyperbranched soya alkyd based nanocomposite coatings and their corrosion inhibition efficiency. Hyperbranched alkyd (HBA) was synthesized using SO, pentaerythritol, and phthalic anhydride. The magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) nanoparticles were dispersed via sonication in butylated melamine formaldehyde (BMF) modified HBA (HBABMF) to formulate the nanocomposite (HBABMFFe(3) O(4)) anticorrosive coatings. The ASTM methods were used to evaluate structural, morphological, physicomechanical, thermal, electrochemical, and anticorrosive properties of these coatings. The HBA has a globular structure with the good degree of branching (DOB = 0. 69). HBABMF and HBABMFFe(3) O(4) nanocomposite coatings showed good flexibility and physicomechanical properties. The inclusion of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles enhanced the load bearing capacity of nanocomposite coatings by dissipating the instantaneous energy in scratch and impact tests. Electrochemical corrosion studies revealed that the HBABMFFe(3) O(4) nanocomposite coatings exhibit superior corrosion resistance performance (impedance = 10 (7) Omega and corrosion rate 1. 0 x 10 (4) mils per year (mpy) than that of HBABMF and other similar reported coating systems...|$|E
30|$|VOCs were {{analyzed}} with the online Proton Transfer Reaction - Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS) which {{was connected to}} the enclosures by 1 / 8 inch tubing. The PTR-MS technique has been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere (Blake et al.[2009], Lindinger et al.[1998 a, b]). The instrument was maintained in an air conditioned room during all experiments. The sample and reference enclosure and the background signal were probed alternately. The instrument was operated in selected ion-monitoring mode at standard operation conditions (E/N[*]=[*] 130 Td; E electric field strength, N buffer gas number density, 1 Td[*]=[*] 10 - 17 [*]cm² V molecule- 1) at a drift voltage of 600 [*]V. The considerable background signal, probably caused by desorption of impurities inside the sampling system and the drift tube (Steinbacher et al.[2004]), was determined by applying <b>VOC</b> <b>free</b> air generated by a catalytic converter (Zero-air generator, Parker Co., USA) to the instrument. This offset was subtracted from the sample and reference signal and the emission rate was calculated according to Eq. 1. Emission rates calculated on a leaf dry weight basis in μg[*]g- 1 [*]h- 1 were standardized using a mathematical algorithm developed by Guenther et al. ([1993, 1995]) and Guenther ([1997]) in following referred to as G 93. This algorithm was developed to predict isoprene emissions, but predicts monoterpene emissions very well too (Ciccioli et al.[1997], Kesselmeier et al.[1997], Kuhn et al.[2002][2004]). G 93 describes the emission of volatile organics as a function of a basic emission strength (i.e. a standard emission factor or basal emission rate, Es) related to the environmental parameters photosynthetic active radiation (PAR, 1000 [*]μmol[*]m- 2 [*]s- 1) and temperature (30 ° C).|$|E

The Huguenots had fled from anti-Protestant persecution in Catholic France to the Netherlands, where the <b>VOC</b> offered them <b>free</b> passage to the Cape as well as farmland. The Huguenots brought important experience in wine production to the Cape, greatly bolstering the industry, {{as well as providing}} strong cultural roots.|$|R
40|$|Aim. The canis lupus familiaris, {{due to his}} {{particular}} olfactory characteristics, {{is used by the}} police to detect a wide range of substances (explosives, gunpowder, narcotics, etc.). Trained dogs to the discovery and reporting human remains or not visible cadaveric blood, can be of great help. This study set out to investigate and validate with scientific method, a training protocol of dogs specialized for research, tracking and reporting of cadaveric latent blood traces of blood. Methods. We used two Labrador Retriever. The study was conducted for sixteen months, with about 200 hours of simulation and 6240 surveys, within a room suitably equipped. We used blood of four patients who died due to trauma, collected in sterile and <b>VOCs</b> <b>free</b> tubes. The first phase of the training focused on the ability of the two dogs to hold the smell target and signal their presence at concentrations always decreasing. In the second phase confounding factors were introduced. Results. The study found the real effectiveness of dogs trained to identify human cadaveric blood in very low concentrations. Tests conducted have shown a good ability to discriminate human cadaveric blood in combination with confounding factors in high concentrations (olfactory accuracy). Conclusion. The use of dogs in this area necessarily requires standardization of training procedures in order to achieve “certified” for this specialized biological device the same rigorous level of reliability and reproducibility required for all methods of investigation in the forensic field, through an optimized and tightly controlled training, through the evaluation of olfactory sensitivity, the ability of olfactory discrimination and olfactory accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Rocket {{species are}} {{increasing}} in popularity with consumers, {{and in the}} last ten years scientific interest has also increased due to the potential health benefits of consuming leaves. They are known for pungent and bitter taste components, and the chemical compounds largely responsible for these sensations are also health beneficial. These compounds are called isothiocyanates (ITCs), and they are ubiquitous in the plant family Brassicaceae. Precursor compounds called glucosinolates (GSLs) are converted to ITCs via the action of myrosinase enzyme. This thesis presents data relating to numerous aspects of rocket species, such as differences in GSLs and ITCs. Other phytochemical constituents (flavonols, volatile organic chemicals (<b>VOCs),</b> <b>free</b> amino acids, free sugars, polyatomic ion content, and organic acids) are explored to determine their impacts on human sensory perceptions and consumer acceptance. The data presented highlight significant differences between ‘wild’ accessions of rocket and commercially available varieties, in terms of flavonol and GSL content and sensory attributes. There is great potential to develop underutilised genetic resources in breeding programs, and through collaboration with a breeding company (Elsoms Seeds Ltd., Spalding, UK) and a commercial salad supplier (Bakkavör Group Ltd., Spalding, UK), several accessions were selected for detailed analyses. Analysis of VOC profiles further demonstrated the differences between the selected cultivars, and by combining these data with sensory and consumer studies, it was observed that the diversity of phytochemical components fundamentally underpins taste, flavour, and consumer acceptance. The same accessions of rocket were also tested under commercial growth, processing and storage conditions. It was hypothesised that this would negatively impact GSL and ITC content of leaves, but in fact increased concentrations up to five fold from the point of harvest in all accessions analysed. We also observed a previously undocumented link between GSL, ITC and free amino acid content with bacterial load...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of work presented covers an investigation in to vegetable oil based monomers {{for use in}} low ‘volatile organic compounds’ (VOC) or <b>VOC</b> <b>free</b> paints. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to recent EU legislation into the reduction of VOCs {{in a wide variety}} of paints and coatings. This is followed by an overview of vegetable oil based chemistry and subsequently the use of vegetable oils within materials, specifically coatings. Chapter 2 discusses the synthesis of a selection of vegetable oil derived monomers using a number of different diamines and aminoalcohols to produce fatty amides with methacrylate, styrene and maleate functionalisation. A selection of 3 vegetable oils with varying degrees of unsaturation (soybean oil, rapeseed oil and cocoa butter) were trialled to see the effect the starting oil had on the subsequent monomers. Removal of some or all of the unsaturation within the fatty chains of the triglycerides and monomers was carried out, primarily as a way to potentially reduce yellowing often found in paints derived from a vegetable oil source. Chapter 3 introduces the technique of emulsion polymerisation, followed by the incorporation of a selection of the methacrylate monomers synthesised in the previous chapter into polymer latexes. Comparisons of the latex properties are made and the results of a variety of tests (DSC, MFFT, hardness, yellowing ability) described. Comparisons between unsaturated and epoxidised derivatives are made and conclusions drawn. Chapter 4 focuses on the preparation of polyurethanes (PU) from a small library of renewable diols. These were synthesised using both cocoa butter and rapeseed oil with diethanolamine, followed by epoxidation of the residual unsaturation in some cases. These were reacted with MDI and a variety of commercial diols (PEGs and 1, 4 -butanediol) and their physical properties (tensile strength, Young’s modulus, swelling and cross-linking density) and thermal properties analysed by a variety of methods (TGA, DSC). Chapter 5 describes the BF 3. Et 2 O catalysed ring-opening of a small range of epoxidised oils derived from rapeseed and cocoa butter to give higher molecular weight pre-polymers/oligomers suitable as polyols for PU synthesis. Two approaches to the monomers are described. Chapter 6 describes the experimental conditions and chemical analysis of the all the key reactions and processes described in the thesis...|$|E

50|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} of this experiment, the Company {{extended}} free passage from 1685 to 1707 for Hollanders wishing to settle at the Cape. In 1688 it sponsored the immigration of 200 French Huguenot refugees forced into exile by the Edict of Fontainebleau. The terms under which the Huguenots agreed to immigrate were the same offered to other <b>VOC</b> subjects, including <b>free</b> passage and requisite farm equipment on credit. Prior attempts at cultivating vineyards or exploiting olive groves for fruit had been unsuccessful, and it was hoped that Huguenot colonists accustomed to Mediterranean agriculture could succeed where the Dutch had failed. They were augmented by VOC soldiers returning from Asia, predominantly Germans channeled into Amsterdam by the Company's extensive recruitment network and thence overseas. Despite their diverse nationalities, the colonists used a common language and adopted similar attitudes towards politics. The attributes they shared came to serve as a basis for the evolution of Afrikaner identity and consciousness.|$|R
40|$|High {{quality wine}} {{requires}} high quality grape. High quality grape means good aromatic properties and texture, excellent phenols panorama, and salubrity. Ozone {{is known as}} a great sanitizing agent but little is known on its effect on grape metabolism. Grape bunches of 'Sauvignon Blanc' (Vitis vinifera L.) were hand harvested at the end of day in Castello de "La Sala" winery, placed in perforated boxes in one single layer and then stacked in a cold room at 10 °C and 70 % RH (relative humidity). Ozone treatment (1. 5 g h- 1) started immediately and bunches were sampled before and after treatment which lasted 4, 8, and 16 h. The control sample consisted in grape bunch treated in similar way, placed in another cold room without ozone treatment. Total phenols on dry weight (d. w.) basis increased of 10 % after 8 and 16 h treatment compared to the control sample. Hydroxycinnamic acids increased 50 - 100 % in ozone-treated sample. Even total carotenoids raised in ozonetreated sample after 16 h. Glycosilated volatiles organic compounds (VOCs) increased in ozone-treated samples while decreased in untreated one; in contrast the <b>free</b> <b>VOCs,</b> which means the perceptible aroma compounds, were higher in untreated grape. This is an important result because the grape for vinification must have many glycosilated VOCs before fermentation which are released during the process by yeasts...|$|R
