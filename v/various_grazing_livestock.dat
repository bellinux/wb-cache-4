40|$|Fur trappers and {{settlers}} {{during the}} early 1800 s reported extensive stands of willows and wide, wet meadows along stream systems throughout the western rangelands. By the early 1900 s, many of these stream systems were severely damaged or eliminated because of improper <b>livestock</b> use. Although <b>grazing</b> practices initiated in the mid- 1930 s have dramatically improved uplands, riparian conditions have continued to decline in most areas. Many grazing management strategies {{are being used to}} restore riparian systems, but there is little understanding of basic stream processes or riparian vegetation requirements. Resource managers must thoroughly understand the relationship between the natural stress in individual stream systems and the management stress of the <b>various</b> <b>grazing</b> systems before prescribing solutions. Riparian exclosures throughout the West have proven that <b>livestock</b> <b>grazing</b> is not necessary to improve stream riparian systems. However, recent experience has shown that with proper <b>grazing,</b> <b>livestock</b> can be present while stream systems are improving. Key words.

The newly formed 3 Creeks Grazing Allotment which consists of 136, 000 acres and has 29 permittees serves as an example of scientifically based public land management using <b>grazing</b> <b>livestock</b> as a management tool. It is believed that <b>livestock</b> <b>grazing</b> {{is the most}} underutilized tool in natural resource management (Hopkin, personal communication).

40|$|Managing {{the mineral}} {{nutrition}} of free-range <b>grazing</b> <b>livestock</b> can be challenging. On farms where grazing animals are infrequently yarded, there are limited opportunities to administer trace element supplements via feeds and concentrates. In New Zealand, {{where the majority}} of sheep, cattle, and deer graze pasture year round, inadequate intake of cobalt, copper, iodine and selenium is prevalent. Scientists and farmers have developed efficient strategies to monitor and treat these dietary deficiencies. Supplementation methods suited to <b>grazing</b> <b>livestock</b> include long-acting injections, slow-release intraruminal boluses, trace element-amended fertilisers, and reticulated water supplies on dairy farms...|$|R

40|$|The study {{examined}} the financial feasibility and impacts of livestock management models found around Mt. Mutis forest in Timor Island of Indonesia. Data was collected through interviewing 40 communities around the forest. There were two livestock management models around the forest, the first model was livestock management which raise livestock in the cattle pen, and the second model was <b>livestock</b> management which <b>graze</b> <b>livestock</b> in the forest. This study found that both livestock management models were financially feasible. However, if commercial cost of workers was counted, the livestock management model which raise livestock in the cattle pen was financially not feasible while livestock management model which <b>graze</b> <b>livestock</b> in the forest was financially feasible. Livestock management model which <b>graze</b> <b>livestock</b> in the forest however had negative impacts on the regeneration of trees.

5000|$|The farmer and/or {{producer}} can {{use this}} same land in another way when crops have been harvested. The introduction of <b>grazing</b> <b>livestock</b> to a field that once held crops can be beneficial for the producer and also the field itself. Livestock {{can be used as}} a natural fertilizer for a producer’s field which will then be beneficial for the producer the next year when crops are planted once again. The practice of <b>grazing</b> <b>livestock</b> using CA helps the farmer who raises crops on that field and the farmer who raises the <b>livestock</b> that <b>graze</b> off that field. Livestock produce compost or manure which are a great help in generating soil fertility (Pawley W.H. 1963). The practices of CA and <b>grazing</b> <b>livestock</b> on a field for many years can allow for better yields in the following years as long as these practices continue to be followed.
