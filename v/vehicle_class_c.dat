40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} which components of heavy-duty highway vehicles are candidates for the substitution of titanium materials for current materials if the cost of those Ti components is very significantly reduced from current levels. The processes which could be used to produce those low cost components were also investigated. Heavy-duty highway vehicles are defined as all trucks and busses included in <b>Classes</b> 2 <b>C</b> through 8. These include heavy pickups and vans above 8, 500 lbs. GVWR, through highway tractor trailers. Class 8 is characterized as being a very cyclic market, with ''normal'' year volume, such as in 2000, of approximately 240, 000 new <b>vehicles.</b> <b>Classes</b> 3 - 7 are less cyclic, with ''normal'' i. e., year 2000, volume totaling approximately 325, 000 new <b>vehicles.</b> <b>Classes</b> 3 - 8 are powered about 88. 5 % by diesel engines, and <b>Class</b> 2 <b>C</b> at very roughly 83 % diesel. The engine portion of the study therefore focused on diesels. Vehicle production volumes were used in estimates of the market size for candidate components...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} new model to {{estimate}} the mean and covariance of stochastic multi-class (multiple <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes)</b> origin-destination (OD) demands from hourly classified traffic counts throughout the whole year. It is usually assumed in the conventional OD demand estimation models that the OD demand by <b>vehicle</b> <b>class</b> is deterministic. Little attention is given on the estimation of the statistical properties of stochastic OD demands {{as well as their}} covariance between different <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes.</b> Also, the interactions between different <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes</b> in OD demand are ignored such as the change of modes between private car and taxi during a particular hourly period over the year. To fill these two gaps, the mean and covariance matrix of stochastic multi-class OD demands for the same hourly period over the year are simultaneously estimated by a modified lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) method. The estimated covariance matrix of stochastic multi-class OD demands can be used to capture the statistical dependency of traffic demands between different <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes.</b> In this paper, the proposed model is formulated as a non-linear constrained optimization problem. An exterior penalty algorithm is adapted to solve the proposed model. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the applications of the proposed model together with some insightful findings on the importance of covariance of OD demand between difference <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Few Active Traffic Management {{measures}} {{proposed in}} the past consider the distinction of different <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes.</b> Examples of vehicle-class specific measures are truck lanes and high-occupancy/toll (HOT) lanes.

In this paper, we develop a multi-class controller that reroutes the traffic class-specifically dependent on the <b>vehicle</b> <b>class.</b> The vehicle-class specific properties such as vehicle length and value of time are used in a model-predictive control approach to optimize the total time spent and the economic costs. Experiments in a simple network with synthetic data show that a multi-class controller outperforms a single-class controller. We further show that the value of time and the incident strength have an influence on which <b>vehicle</b> <b>class</b> is rerouted by the multi-class controller.
