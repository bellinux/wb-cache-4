5|$|Not all <b>volcanism</b> in Chile is {{relative}} to subduction of the Nazca Plate; the Chile Ridge exhibits submarine <b>volcanism,</b> and <b>volcanism</b> in the Austral Volcanic Zone is {{triggered by the}} Antarctic Plate subducting beneath the South American Plate. One hundred ninety-eight South American volcanoes are on the Global <b>Volcanism</b> Program's Holocene volcano list.|$|E
5|$|Offshore <b>volcanism</b> also {{occurs in}} Chile. Intraplate <b>volcanism</b> {{generated}} from the Easter and Juan Fernández hotspots has formed many Chilean islands, including Isla Salas y Gómez, Easter Island, and the Juan Fernández Islands. Underwater <b>volcanism</b> occurs due to seafloor spreading along the Chile Ridge.|$|E
5|$|<b>Volcanism</b> in {{the region}} of Carpathia and Pannonia has been ongoing since 20 million years ago but has {{decreased}} during the Quaternary. No eruptions have occurred in the Holocene. The last <b>volcanism</b> occurred at Ciomadul in the last glacial age. Sparse basaltic <b>volcanism</b> has also occurred in the area, forming monogenetic volcanic fields.|$|E
5|$|Activity at Incapillo {{commenced}} {{shortly after}} the end of the Maricunga Belt <b>volcanism</b> and occurred first at Monte Pissis between 6.5 and 3.5mya. Later <b>volcanism</b> occurred south of Incapillo 4.7±0.5mya, at Sierra de Veladero 5.6±1–3.6±0.5mya, and in the region of Cerro Bonete Chico 5.2±0.6–3.5±0.1mya. Some of the 32mya Pircas Negras mafic andesites appear to be associated with the Incapillo volcanic complex. These rocks form the last pulse of the Pircas Negras <b>volcanism.</b> Specific ages of the Pircas Negras flows in the Incapillo region include 4.7±0.5mya, 3.2±0.3mya and 1.9±0.2mya. Later, andesitic-rhyolitic <b>volcanism</b> formed ignimbrites and lava domes 2.9±0.4–1.1±0.4mya, with the youngest pre-caldera dome being 0.873±0.077mya old. The lava domes formed through non-explosive extrusion.|$|E
5|$|Io's {{main source}} of {{internal}} heat comes from the tidal forces generated by Jupiter's gravitational pull. This external heating differs from the internal heat source for <b>volcanism</b> on Earth, which {{is a result of}} radioactive isotope decay and residual heat from accretion. In the Earth, these internal heat sources drive mantle convection, which in turn causes <b>volcanism</b> through plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Level Mountain has {{experienced}} volcanic eruptions sporadically {{for the last}} 15 million years, making it the most persistent volcano of the NCVP. More than 20 eruptive centres are present on the summit and flanks of the massif. These have produced mainly felsic and mafic lavas, a chemical composition range typical of bimodal <b>volcanism.</b> Such <b>volcanism</b> commonly occurs at hotspots, continental rifts and leaky transform faults. The existence of olivine, orthopyroxene and spinel xenocrysts in Level Mountain basalt suggest that <b>volcanism</b> at the massif originated from the upper mantle. Hiatuses of up to a million years or more can be expected between periods of volcanic activity at Level Mountain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Volcanism</b> in this {{chain is}} calc-alkaline, {{yielding}} both andesite, dacite, and rhyolite. Three million years ago, {{a change in}} the chemistry of <b>volcanism</b> occurred, with an increased content of potassium in the rocks. This change in composition geographically coincided with the volcanic activity crossing a lineament known as the Trotus line.|$|E
5|$|As the greenstone belts were forming, volcanoes ejected tephra {{into the}} air which settled as sediments to become {{compacted}} into the greywackes and mudstones of the Knife Lake and Lake Vermilion formations. Greywackes are poorly sorted mixtures of clay, mica and quartz that may be derived from the decomposition of pyroclastic debris; {{the presence of this}} debris suggests that some explosive volcanic activity had occurred in the area earlier. The <b>volcanism</b> took place on the surface and the other deformations took place at various depths. Numerous earthquakes accompanied the <b>volcanism</b> and faulting.|$|E
5|$|Ciomadul {{has been}} active for over half a million years, with the oldest {{activity}} between 1,000,000 and 750,000 years ago forming lava domes. Older estimates indicate that activity did not start before 250,000 years ago, while more recent research indicated a start of <b>volcanism</b> over 600,000 years ago. <b>Volcanism</b> at Ciomadul consisted mostly of the extrusion of lava domes, their collapse forming block-and-ash flows and subplinian and Vulcanian eruptions.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 a {{prominent}} bright {{spot in the}} atmosphere was noted by an amateur astronomer and photographed by Venus Express. Its cause is currently unknown, with surface <b>volcanism</b> advanced as a possible explanation.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} article, J. David Archibald and David E. Fastovsky {{discussed}} a scenario combining three major postulated causes: <b>volcanism,</b> marine regression, and extraterrestrial impact. In this scenario, terrestrial and marine communities were stressed by the changes in, and loss of, habitats. Dinosaurs, {{as the largest}} vertebrates, were the first affected by environmental changes, and their diversity declined. At the same time, particulate materials from <b>volcanism</b> cooled and dried areas of the globe. Then, an impact event occurred, causing collapses in photosynthesis-based food chains, both in the already-stressed terrestrial food chains and in the marine food chains. The major difference between this hypothesis and the single-cause hypotheses is that its proponents view the suggested single causes as, either not sufficient in strength to cause the extinctions or, not likely to produce the taxonomic pattern of the extinction. Recent work at Seymour Island, Antarctica showed two separate extinction events near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, with one correlating to Deccan Trap <b>volcanism</b> and one correlated with the Chicxulub impact.|$|E
5|$|Subduction of the Nazca Plate {{beneath the}} South America plate is {{responsible}} for most of the <b>volcanism</b> in the Central Volcanic Zone. After activity in the western Maricunga Belt volcanic arc ceased six million years ago, <b>volcanism</b> started up in the Incapillo region, forming the high volcanoes Monte Pissis, Cerro Bonete Chico and Sierra de Veladero. Later, a number of lava domes formed between these volcanoes.|$|E
5|$|The Andean Volcanic Belt {{consists}} of three main volcanic zones: the Northern Volcanic Zone (from 2° N to 5° S), the Central Volcanic Zone (16° to 28° S) and the Southern Volcanic Zone (33° to 46° S). Active <b>volcanism</b> occurs where the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate. The plates are separated by shallower subduction zones, with no present-day <b>volcanism.</b> These shallower zones {{have been attributed to}} the high speed of the plate collision, the young age of the subducting oceanic lithosphere and the curvature of the subducting plate. The most plausible theory is that variations in buoyancy of a subducting plate creates a flat subduction zone. The Cocos, Juan Fernandez and Nazca Ridges are associated with such volcanic gaps where they collide with the oceanic trench. The subduction of spreading ridges can also diminish <b>volcanism,</b> as observed in the Chile Rise further south. The buoyancy of these crustal structures may hinder subduction, reducing water supply to the mantle and inducing the formation of melts.|$|E
5|$|The Cascade Range was {{produced}} by convergence of the North American Plate with the subducting Juan de Fuca Plate. Active <b>volcanism</b> has taken place for approximately 36million years; the nearby Challis Range features complexes as old as 55 mya. Most geologists believe that activity in the Cascades has been relatively intermittent, producing up to 3,000 volcanic calderas at a time. Frequent <b>volcanism</b> within the last 10,000years created complexes from Mount Garibaldi in British Columbia to north California's Lassen Peak complex. Remarkably different from state to state, the <b>volcanism</b> ranges from large volcanoes to zones of many smaller geologic features such as lava shields and cinder cones. TheCascadevolcanoes are divided into two large sectors, called the High Cascades and the Western Cascades; Thielsen {{is part of the}} High Cascades, which are east of the Western Cascades.|$|E
5|$|Above these ignimbrites {{are found}} {{sedimentary}} rocks of the Esk Pike Sandstone Formation. These were deposited in water, probably in a caldera lake, as the volcanic rocks weathered and were eroded. Structures in these rocks suggest the faults were still active and the caldera was still subsiding. Layers of tuff and lapilli-tuff indicate some ongoing <b>volcanism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{some of the}} seamounts in the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain {{appear to}} follow the {{expected}} age progression for a mantle plume trail, others, such as Denson Seamount, are older than that hypothesis would suggest. As a result, the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain has also been proposed by geoscientists to be a mix of ridge and mantle plume <b>volcanism.</b>|$|E
5|$|At Panxian, {{there appears}} to have been a {{transition}} in the endemic marine reptile fauna, possibly caused by <b>volcanism.</b> This <b>volcanism</b> is indicated by the presence of a bentonite layer between the Middle and Upper Reptile Horizons. From lower in the Upper Reptile Horizon, fossils have also been found of the ubiquitous mixosaurian ichthyosaur Mixosaurus panxianensis (which occurs in all layers), the pachypleurosaurs Keichousaurus sp. and Wumengosaurus delicatomandibularis, and fish, although fossils of the latter are fragmentary. The lower Middle and Lower Reptile Horizons also include the mixosaurian Phalarodon cf. fraasi, the primitive ichthyosaur Xinminosaurus catactes, the placodont Placodus inexpectatus, the nothosaurs Lariosaurus hongguoensis and Nothosaurus yangjuanensis, and the archosaur Qianosuchus mixtus, alongside bivalves and saurichthyid fish.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos {{is in the}} South Volcanic Zone, which {{contains}} potentially deadly and active volcanoes such as Mount Hudson, Llaima, and Villarrica. Villarrica and Llaima together have more than 80reported episodes of <b>volcanism</b> since 1558, and at least 40South Volcanic Zone volcanoes have had Holocene-age eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Cataclysmic events (meteorite/asteroid impacts, <b>volcanism)</b> {{that cause}} mass extinctions of species that, until the event, were {{perfectly}} adapted to their environment, {{such as the}} dinosaurs. The dramatic reduction of competition among the surviving species makes newly evolved species more likely to survive.|$|E
5|$|Cerro Azul {{is in the}} South Volcanic Zone, {{where many}} volcanoes {{pose a threat to}} human life. Among the other active volcanoes of the South Volcanic Zone are Mount Hudson, Llaima, and Villarrica. Villarrica and Llaima {{together}} have more than 80 reported episodes of <b>volcanism</b> since 1558, and at least 40 South Volcanic Zone volcanoes have had Holocene-age eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Hekla in Iceland, {{an example}} of basaltic Plinian <b>volcanism</b> being its 1947–48 eruption. The past 800 years have been a pattern of violent initial eruptions of pumice {{followed}} by prolonged extrusion of basaltic lava from {{the lower part of}} the volcano.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{has some}} of the Earth's oldest rocks, gneisses that are about 3.6 billion years old (80 percent as old as the planet). About 2.7 billion years ago, basaltic lava poured out of cracks in the floor of the {{primordial}} ocean; the remains of this volcanic rock formed the Canadian Shield in northeast Minnesota. The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of Precambrian seas formed the Iron Range of northern Minnesota. Following a period of <b>volcanism</b> 1.1 billion years ago, Minnesota's geological activity has been more subdued, with no <b>volcanism</b> or mountain formation, but with repeated incursions of the sea, which left behind multiple strata of sedimentary rock.|$|E
5|$|Monte Burney is {{a volcano}} in {{southern}} Chile, {{part of its}} Austral Volcanic Zone which consists of six volcanoes with activity during the Quaternary. This <b>volcanism</b> {{is linked to the}} subduction of the Antarctic Plate beneath the South America Plate and the Scotia Plate.|$|E
5|$|Platinum {{exists in}} higher abundances on the Moon and in meteorites. Correspondingly, {{platinum}} {{is found in}} slightly higher abundances at sites of bolide impact on Earth {{that are associated with}} resulting post-impact <b>volcanism,</b> and can be mined economically; the Sudbury Basin is one such example.|$|E
5|$|Seamounts {{are often}} found in groupings or {{submerged}} archipelagos, a classic example being the Emperor Seamounts, {{an extension of the}} Hawaiian Islands. Formed millions of years ago by <b>volcanism,</b> they have since subsided far below sea level. This long chain of islands and seamounts extends thousands of kilometers northwest from the island of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Sir Archibald Geikie (1835–1924) was {{the first}} to {{recognise}} that there had been multiple glaciations, and his 1863 paper On the glacial drift of Scotland was a landmark in the emergent theories of glaciation. He became Director-General of the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom in 1888 and was also well known for his work on <b>volcanism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Strombolian eruptions {{are similar}} to Hawaiian eruptions, but there are differences. Strombolian eruptions are noisier, produce no {{sustained}} eruptive columns, do not produce some volcanic products associated with Hawaiian <b>volcanism</b> (specifically Pele's tears and Pele's hair), and produce fewer molten lava flows (although the eruptive material does tend to form small rivulets).|$|E
5|$|Subduction of the Guadalupe Plate/Farallon Plate beneath Baja California was {{prevalent}} in the region until 12,5–11 million years ago; volcanic activity since then is due to tectonic changes associated {{with the development of}} the Gulf of California. Earlier subduction-related <b>volcanism</b> during the Miocene formed the volcanic deposits of the Comondú Group.|$|E
5|$|Subduction, having ceased at the {{existing}} zone, eventually reinitiated {{further to the}} west as the current Cascadia subduction zone. <b>Volcanism</b> from the new subduction zone (such as the Grays River Volcanics and Northcraft Volcanics) reached the surface about 42 Ma, thereby initiating {{the rise of the}} ancestral Cascade Range.|$|E
5|$|The Altiplano {{started to}} form during the Eocene, when {{subduction}} of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate caused compression along the plate margin. Strong <b>volcanism</b> and tectonic uplift occurred between 15and 20million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The Deccan Traps {{could have}} caused {{extinction}} through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulfuric aerosols into the air, which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap <b>volcanism</b> might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions that increased the greenhouse effect when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of a supercontinent insulates the mantle. The flow of heat will be concentrated, resulting in <b>volcanism</b> and the flooding of large areas with basalt. Rifts will form and the supercontinent will split up once more. The planet may then experience a warming period, as occurred during the Cretaceous period.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic {{activity}} at Fueguino {{is part of}} the Austral Volcanic Zone, which is formed by the subduction of the Antarctic Plate beneath the South America Plate. The subducting plate has not reached a depth sufficient for proper volcanic arc <b>volcanism,</b> however.|$|E
5|$|<b>Volcanism</b> in the Spanish Creek and Ray Lake {{areas were}} synglacial but {{continued}} after the glacial ice had melted away. Two cinder cones, known as Flourmill Cone and Pointed Stick Cone, {{were created in}} the Spanish Creek area. Lava flows from the two cinder cones lie on glaciated bedrock without an intervening paleosol, indicating an early Holocene age.|$|E
5|$|Volcanology of Io, a moon of Jupiter, is the {{scientific}} study of lava flows, volcanic pits, and <b>volcanism</b> (volcanic activity) on the surface of Io. Its volcanic activity was discovered in 1979 by Voyager 1 imaging scientist Linda Morabito. Observations of Io by passing spacecraft (the Voyagers, Galileo, Cassini, and New Horizons) and Earth-based astronomers have revealed more than 150 active volcanoes. Up to 400 such volcanoes are predicted to exist based on these observations. Io's <b>volcanism</b> makes the satellite one of only four known currently volcanically active worlds in the Solar System (the other three being Earth, Saturn's moon Enceladus, and Neptune's moon Triton).|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Greece and Italy, historical <b>volcanism</b> has not taken place in Continental Europe. The most recent volcanic activity occurred between 40,000 and 6,500 years ago in Garrotxa, the Massif Central and the Vulkaneifel.|$|E
