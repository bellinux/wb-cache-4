50|$|<b>Viloxazine,</b> like imipramine, {{inhibited}} norepinephrine reuptake in {{the hearts}} of rats and mice; unlike imipramine, it did not block reuptake of norepinephrine in either the medullae or the hypothalami of rats. As for serotonin, while its reuptake inhibition was comparable to that of desipramine (i.e., very weak), <b>viloxazine</b> did potentiate serotonin-mediated brain functions {{in a manner similar to}} amitriptyline and imipramine, which are relatively potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake.

5000|$|<b>Viloxazine</b> was {{discovered}} by scientists at Imperial Chemical Industries when they recognized that some beta blockers inhibited serotonin reuptake inhibitor activity in the brain at high doses. To improve the ability of their compounds to cross the blood brain barrier, they changed the ethanolamine side chain of beta blockers to a morpholine ring, leading to the synthesis of <b>viloxazine.</b> The drug was first marketed in 1976. [...] It was never approved by the FDA, but the FDA granted it an orphan designation (but not approval) for cataplexy and narcolepsy in 1984. It was withdrawn from markets worldwide in 2002 for business reasons.|$|E

40|$|Biochemical and {{pharmacological}} investigations {{about the}} effect of the antidepressant drug <b>viloxazine</b> (Vivalan) on catecholamine metabolism in rats led to the following results: <b>Viloxazine</b> exerts a dose and time dependent inhibition of monoamine oxidase activity of brain and liver mitochondrial fraction and tissue homogenates of hypothalamus, heart, liver, and adrenal glands, both in vitro and after oral and parenteral administration in vivo. Consequently, an increase in catecholamine concentrations in brain of rats could be observed after pretreatment with <b>viloxazine.</b> In addition brain serotonin concentrations rose and 5 -hydroxy-indoleacetic acid was diminished. However, characterization of inhibition of monoamine oxidase activity by <b>viloxazine</b> in vitro revealed: Compared to the specific inhibitors clorgyline for MAO-A- and pargyline for MAO-B-activity, <b>viloxazine</b> was a very weak inhibitor both for MAO-A and MAO-B in vitro. The type of inhibition was competitive and reversible. From the presented results and the results obtained by other laboratories it is concluded that inhibition of monoamine oxidase activity by <b>viloxazine,</b> although clearly demonstrated in animal experiments, may not be the only mechanism for an antidepressant action of the drug in man...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>viloxazine</b> (150 - 300 mg daily for 21 days) on plasma {{phenytoin}} levels at steady state was examined in 10 epileptic patients stabilised {{on a fixed}} phenytoin dosage.

In four patients the rise in plasma phenytoin was associated with the development of signs of phenytoin toxicity. Discontinuation of <b>viloxazine</b> resulted in return of plasma phenytoin towards baseline values and disappearance of the clinical symptoms. The mechanism of interaction probably involves inhibition of phenytoin metabolism by <b>viloxazine.</b> Careful monitoring of plasma phenytoin levels is recommended in patients treated with phenytoin who need to be started on <b>viloxazine</b> therapy...|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{cases of}} <b>viloxazine</b> {{overdosage}} are reported. All patients recovered without sequelae and no ECG abnormalities were observed.

As <b>viloxazine</b> is rapidly absorbed {Bayliss & Case 1975, Case & Reeves 1975) lavage should be carried otd {{as soon as possible}} after the tablets are taken. Since the drug is almost exclusively excreted in the urine, it is suggested that forced diuresis be carried out to reduce blood levels as quickly as possible. <b>Viloxazine</b> hydrochloride (Vivalan) became generally available to doctors in the United Kingdom in November 1974. It is presented as 50 mg tablets and the average daily dose is 200 mg. <b>Viloxazine</b> is an antidepressant chemically unrelated to the tricyclic group (Mallion et al 1972) and has been shown to possess antidepressant properties at least equal to those of Imipramine (Tsegos & Ekdawi 1974, Bayliss et al 1974). Early studies in animals indicated that <b>viloxazine</b> possesses a low level of toxicity (Mallion et al 1972). The oral LD 50 in mice was I-O g/kg and in rats, 2 - 0 g/kg; the intravenous LD 50 in mice was 60 mg/kg and in rats, 60 - 77 mg/kg.

In one study the antidepressant effect of <b>viloxazine</b> at {{a dose of}} 150 mg daily was statistically {{greater than that of}} placebo, whilst in the second study <b>viloxazine</b> was statistically superior to diazepam (15 mg daily). In depressed patients with a clear anxiety component, <b>viloxazine</b> alone seemed preferable to a combination with a tranquillizer as such a combination did not produce an enhanced clinical effect and the incidence of side-effects was possibly in creased. <b>Viloxazine</b> was generally well tolerated and side-effects, when they occurred, were generally a mild upper gastro-intestinal disturbance. I n t r o d u c t i o n The importance of assessing the clinical effect of any new psychotropic drug by comparison with placebo has been emphasized by Malitz & Kanzler (1971). As far as trials in depressive illness are concerned, ethical considerations preclude prolonged treatment with placebo due to the subjective unpleasantness of the illness and the possibility of suicide, yet it is in depressive illness that marked placebo responses may be seen.

40|$|In six {{depressed}} epileptic patients stabilised on carbamazepine therapy, {{addition of}} the antidepressant agent <b>viloxazine</b> (300 mg/day for three weeks) induced a marked (average 55 %) increase in steady-state plasma carbamazepine concentration. The concentration of the active metabolite carbamazepine- 10, 11 -epoxide also increased during <b>viloxazine</b> therapy, but {{to a lesser extent}} (16 %). In three patients, these effects were associated with symptoms of carbamazepine intoxication, which regressed rapidly when plasma carbamazepine and carbamazepine- 10, 11 -epoxide levels returned to baseline values after discontinuation of <b>viloxazine.</b> In a seventh patient, <b>viloxazine</b> had to be discontinued after only two weeks because of severe side effects associated with a striking elevation of carbamazepine and carbamazepine 10, 11 -epoxide levels (by 197 % and 137 % respectively). Although <b>viloxazine</b> appears {{to be one of the}} few antidepressants which can be used safely in patients with epilepsy these results indicate that the drug should be prescribed with great caution in subjects treated with carbamazepine.

40|$|Forty-eight mild to {{moderate}} depressives were treated by six genera practitioners with a chemically novel anti-depressant, ' Vivalan ' (<b>viloxazine</b> hydrochloride, ICI 58 834). Twenty-five patients took 150 mg/day in three divided doses, and twenty-three took 200 mg/day in two divided doses, each for twenty-one days. The severity of both the depressive symptoms and the anxiety symptoms showed a statistically highly significant reduction over {{the duration of the}} study.

40|$|Concordant {{with the}} adrenergic-cholinergic {{imbalance}} hypothesis of affective psychosis, {{there is a}} cholinergic supersensitivity in depression. Thus, the anticholinergic properties of some antidepressants might contribute to their efficacy. However, in the present double-blind studies (n = 20) with mianserin and <b>viloxazine,</b> respectively, which lack anticholinergic properties, adjunctive treatment with the anticholinergic biperiden versus placebo did not enhance the antidepressive efficacy. Therefore, we hypothesized that cholinergic supersensitivity might be linked to some possibly predisposing dimension of personality. Indeed, in healthy male volunteers (n = 11) the behavioral and cardiovascular sensitivity to physostigmine correlated significantly with "irritability" and "emotional lability" {{as well as with}} habitually passive strategies in stress coping. The rise in plasma cortisol and norepinephrine correlated with "retardation"; that of epinephrine with active coping. Thus, the cholinergic supersensitivity in affective psychoses might be linked to a personality dimension like stress sensitivity rather than to the diagnostic category itself...|$|E
40|$|A fatal {{toxicity}} index (deaths per million National Health Service prescriptions) {{was calculated for}} antidepressant drugs on sale during the years 1975 - 84 in England, Wales, and Scotland. The tricyclic drugs introduced before 1970 had a higher index than the mean for all the drugs studied (p less than 0. 001). In this group the toxicity of amitriptyline, dibenzepin, desipramine, and dothiepin was significantly higher, while that of clomipramine, imipramine, iprindole, protriptyline, and trimipramine was lower. The monoamine oxidase inhibitors had intermediate toxicity, and the antidepressants introduced since 1973, considered as a group, had significantly lower toxicity than the mean (p less than 0. 001).

40|$|Enzymes are the {{catalysts}} {{of nature}} and they facilitate thousands of chemical conversions in living organisms. Enzymes work in an aqueous environment at neutral pH and ambient temperature. Such mild reaction conditions are also highly advantageous for synthetic organic synthesis because this can reduce energy use and prevent the formation of undesired side-products. Enzymes have been successfully applied as catalyst in synthetic organic synthesis {{for more than a}} century but their biocatalytic use also has serious limitations. It is often possible to evolve enzyme variants with improved properties in the laboratory but this requires time-consuming and expensive massive screening of mutant enzyme collections. In this thesis a number of tools and strategies are explored that facilitate the knowledge driven laboratory evolution of enzymes. A number of these approaches and principles are experimentally evaluated and are focused on enhancing the biocatalytic potential of haloalkane dehalogenases. This unique class of enzymes catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of carbon-halogen bonds. In one of the studies a haloalkane dehalogenase was engineered for the conversion of a toxic waste compound into valuable chiral building blocks that can be used for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals such as propranolol and <b>viloxazine...</b>|$|E
40|$|Hepatic oxygenases of the {{cytochrome}} P- 450 family play a {{major role}} in the clearance of various anti-epileptic drugs. These enzymes are susceptible both to induction and to inhibition. Phenytoin, carbamazepine (CBZ), primidone, and phenobarbitone, for instance, are potent enzyme inducers. Other drugs, such as chloramphenicol, propoxyphene, verapamil, and <b>viloxazine,</b> inhibit cytochrome P- 450. Pharmacokinetic behaviour is thus often altered, especially in combined medication, so that the dosage has to be re-adjusted if an optimum therapeutic outcome is to be ensured. Oxcarbazepine (OXC) is a keto analogue of CBZ. In the human liver the keto group is readily reduced, and the resulting monohydroxy metabolite is cleared by glucuronidation. The two enzymes mediating these reactions, i. e. aldo-keto reductase and UDP-glucuronyltransferase, do not depend on cytochrome P- 450. The monohydroxy metabolite is the major active substance in plasma. Its elimination is not enhanced by OXC. Moreover, OXC seems to have little effect on cytochrome P- 450. Aldo-keto reductases and glucuronyltransferases are in general less sensitive to induction and inhibition than are P- 450 dependent enzymes. On the whole, OXC possesses very little potential for metabolic drug interactions, and thus differs favourably from other anti-epileptic drugs...|$|E
40|$|Narcolepsy is {{a chronic}} sleep {{disorder}} characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness, {{with or without}} cataplexy, sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations, with an estimated prevalence of 0. 02 to 0. 05 % worldwide. The goal of managing narcolepsy is to keep patients as alert as possible during daytime hours and to minimise the incidence of cataplexy. A combination of nonpharmacological (lifestyle and behavioural modifications) and pharmacological treatments {{may be used to}} alleviate excessive daytime sleepiness. Stimulants such as amphetamines and methylphenidate have been the mainstay of pharmacological treatment, although a range of different agents have been used over several decades. Modafinil, a benzohydrylsulfinyl-acetamide derivative, has demonstrated good efficacy in the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness, but has limited anticataplectic effects. In clinical studies modafinil 200 to 400 mg/day significantly improved subjective and objective measures of sleepiness and alertness compared with placebo. A long term study of up to 10 years' duration showed modafinil to have good to excellent efficacy in 64 % of patients. Use of modafinil {{does not appear to be}} associated with the development of tolerance or dependence, and it is considered to have limited potential for abuse. Modafinil is generally well tolerated with few adverse effects, the most common being headache, nausea, nervousness and anxiety. It may be coadministered with drugs for treating cataplexy. The efficacy and the cost effectiveness of modafinil in the treatment of narcolepsy have not been compared with other available agents. Conclusions: Modafinil provides a useful alternative to traditional stimulants for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. It is well tolerated, may be taken in combination with medications for cataplexy, and shows long term efficacy without development of tolerance.

40|$|The {{isolated}} field-stimulated {{vas deferens}} {{of the rat}} (0. 1 Hz, 3 ms, 30 - 40 V) was used to study {{the relationship between the}} in vivo inhibition of neuronal uptake of noradrenaline (NA) by cyclic antidepressant drugs and the subsequent activation/desensitization of presynaptic alpha 2 -adrenoceptors. Receptor activation was indirectly measured by quantifying the ability of each drug to inhibit basal twitch responses after their acute administration. Receptor desensitization was also indirectly measured by quantifying the ability of the drugs to reduce the inhibitory effects of selective alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonists on the electrically-induced twitch responses after their long-term administration. The acute in vivo administration of desipramine and other antidepressants (0. 5 - 10 mg kg- 1; i. p.; 2 h) resulted in dose-dependent inhibitions of the basal twitch responses which were rapidly reversed to control values by idazoxan (10 - 5 M). In vitro, desipramine and other antidepressants also inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner (10 (- 9) - 10 (- 5) M) the twitch responses. In rats pretreated 12 h earlier with reserpine (1 mg kg- 1; i. p.) or oxypertine (4 mg kg- 1; i. p.), desipramine (10 mg kg- 1; 2 h) did not induce inhibition of the basal twitch responses or it induced a smaller effect, respectively. For the various antidepressants the degree of inhibition of the basal twitch responses (desipramine greater than protriptyline greater than nortriptyline greater than maprotiline = imipramine greater than amitriptyline greater than <b>viloxazine</b> greater than iprindole much greater than zimelidine) was highly correlated (r = 0. 914) with the potency for blockade of [3 H]-NA uptake into rat brain synaptosomes. Clonidine and xylazine inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner (10 (- 9) - 10 (- 6) M) the twitch responses. The long-term (7 - 14 days) administration of antidepressants or cocaine (10 mg kg- 1, i. p.) resulted in significant decreases in sensitivity to clonidine or xylazine. Short-term (3 days) treatment with desipramine did not reduce the sensitivity to clonidine. The results indicate that the acute in vivo inhibition of NA neuronal uptake by antidepressants leads to the activation (through endogenous NA) of presynaptic inhibitory alpha 2 -adrenoceptors which results in inhibition of the twitch responses. In contrast, prolonged in vivo inhibition of NA reuptake is followed by a slow desensitization process of the same receptors which results in a reduction of sensitivity to clonidine...|$|E
