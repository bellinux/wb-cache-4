40|$|To {{support policy}} makers combating travel-related externalities, quality data are {{required}} for the design and management of transportation systems and policies. To this end, much money has been spent on collecting household- and person-based data. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to assess the quality of origin-destination (O-D) matrices derived from household activity travel surveys. To this purpose, a Monte Carlo experiment is set up to estimate the precision of O-D matrices given different sampling rates. The Belgian 2001 census data, containing work- and school-related travel information for all 10, 296, 350 residents, are used for the experiment. For different sampling rates, 2, 000 random stratified samples are drawn. For each sample, three O-D matrices are composed: one at the municipality level, one at the district level, and one at the provincial level. The correspondence between the samples and the population is assessed by using the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and a censored version of the MAPE (MCAPE). The results show that no accurate O-D matrices can be derived directly from these surveys. Only when half of the population is queried is an acceptable O-D matrix obtained at the provincial level. Therefore, use of additional information to grasp better the behavioral realism underlying destination choices and collection of information about particular O-D pairs by means of <b>vehicle</b> <b>intercept</b> <b>surveys</b> are recommended. In addition, results suggest using the MCAPE next to traditional criteria to examine dissimilarities between different O-D matrices. An important avenue for further research is the investigation of the effect of sampling proportions on travel demand model outcomes. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Growing {{interest}} in sustainable transportation systems and livable communities {{has created a}} need for more complete measures of pedestrian travel. Yet, many performance measures do not account for short pedestrian movements, such as walking between stores in a shopping district, walking from a street parking space to a building entrance, or walking from a bus stop to home. This study uses a 2009 <b>intercept</b> <b>survey</b> and the 2009 National Household Travel Survey to quantify pedestrian travel to, from, and within 20 San Francisco Bay Area shopping districts. Overall, walking was the primary travel mode for 21 % of <b>intercept</b> <b>survey</b> and 10 % of NHTS tours with stops in these shopping districts. However, detailed analysis of pedestrian movements showed that walking was common on respondent tours (52 % of <b>intercept</b> <b>survey</b> tours included some walking) and that walking was used on the majority of trips within these shopping districts (65 % of <b>intercept</b> <b>survey</b> trips and 71 % of NHTS trips within the shopping districts were made by walking). In general, Urban Core and Suburban Main Street shopping districts had higher levels of pedestrian activity than Suburban Thoroughfare and Suburban Shopping Center shopping districts. The detailed analysis in this paper provides a more complete picture of pedestrian activity than is commonly shown by national and regional household survey summaries. ...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveCorner stores, {{also known}} as bodegas, are {{prevalent}} in low-income urban areas and primarily stock high-energy foods and beverages. Little is known about individual-level purchases in these locations. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to assess corner store purchases (items, nutritional characteristics and amount spent) made by children, adolescents and adults in a low-income urban environment. DesignEvaluation staff used 9238 <b>intercept</b> <b>surveys</b> to directly examine food and beverage purchases. SettingIntercepts were collected at 192 corner stores in Philadelphia, PA, USA. SubjectsParticipants were adult, adolescent and child corner store shoppers. ResultsAmong the 9238 <b>intercept</b> <b>surveys,</b> there were 20 244 items. On average, at each corner store visit, consumers purchased 2272 (SD 2271) items (1273 (SD 2270) foods and 0279 (SD 0279) beverages) that cost US 22774 (SD US 32752) and contained 2786275 (SD 4454272) kJ (666270 (SD 1064276) kcal).

40|$|Abstract. -This paper {{describes}} the avidity bias (the disproportionate representation of avid anglers) in <b>intercept</b> <b>surveys</b> and shows how bias-corrected estimates of mean and variance can be computed. It compares bias-corrected participation rates with actual participation rates reported by California anglers {{in an economic}} survey conducted as a mail follow-up to a random telephone canvass, and in an on-site <b>intercept</b> <b>survey.</b> Although both samples contained this bias, {{it was much more}} pronounced in the on-site survey than in the mail survey. The findings indicate that failure to correct for avidity bias results in inflated estimates of per capita fishing expenditures and consumer surplus as well as fishing effort. In general, the effect of the avidity bias on estimates of economic value depends not only on the extent of the bias, but also on the relationship between angler expenditures and avidity, and on the functional form of the travel cost model underlying estimates of consumer surplus. Deciding upon a method for identifying poten-tial respondents is an important first step in de-signing angler surveys. This decision typically involves a trade-off between cost and bias. Fo...|$|R

30|$|A {{perception}} {{survey was}} conducted to test how bicyclists perceive their satisfaction levels under varying roadway environments. Videography survey (showing roadway environments to the participants through suitable video clips and asking them to rate the road under shown conditions) and traveler <b>intercept</b> <b>survey</b> (on-site face-to-face interaction with the users of interest) are commonly followed methods to assess user’s satisfaction levels. It is well accepted that, videography survey is an established method and has several advantages like (1) the number of street segments that participants can rate during a reasonable period of time is generally high, (2) more diverse group of participants can be included, (3) it is more cost-effective than having respondents on site, and many more. Thus, an extensive videography survey {{was carried out in}} this study to gather a huge amount of data sets. These data sets were utilized for the development of BLOS models. However, videography survey has several limitations as well, and those bicyclists who travel regularly on a road segment are the best examiners of the perceived bicycling quality of that particular roadway section. Thus, a traveler <b>intercept</b> <b>survey</b> was also carried out at some identified locations (22 segments), and the proposed BLOS model was validated with so obtained data sets.|$|R

40|$|How {{people respond}} to {{research}} surveys has been of long standing interest to investigators. In this paper, we reflect on our experiences in using the <b>intercept</b> <b>survey</b> {{as part of a}} study that examined m‑payment in Thailand. The paper does not rep ort the findings of the original m‑payment study, but highlights how the cultural features of the target population were an important consideration at the survey translation, pilot testing and data collection stages. We propose that cultural features such as face‑to‑face interaction, the intrinsic notion of politeness (Kreng Jai) and conveying respect to potential participants (giving the Wai) as significant elements in achieving a relatively high participation rate. Survey translation occurred via mo derated discussions where the cultural dimensions of collectivism and personal status (relevant in high PDI societies) were observed to influence group dynamics. In the field, the <b>intercept</b> <b>survey</b> promoted direct engagement with people (preferred among st collectivism cultures), with respondents observed to be highly considerate of investigator needs and thus more likely to participate in the study. The paper�s contribution is one of highlighting the importance of considering national culture in the ini tial survey translation stage and later when collecting data in the field. Although a reflective piece, we believe that the findings have the potential to inform and assist researchers {{to improve the quality of}} their survey instruments and data responses in similar cultural settings...|$|R
