40|$|This work {{presents}} an investigation on a flow phenomenon marked by in-plane velocity non-uniformity {{associated with a}} ported shroud turbocharger compressor observed upstream of the compressor inlet at lower operating speeds. The effect of structural struts in the ported shroud (PS) cavity {{and the location of}} the <b>volute</b> <b>tongue</b> on velocity non-uniformity is studied in this paper by numerically modelling the complete compressor stage using a (Un) steady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS & URANS) approach. The results show that the amplitude of in-plane velocity non-uniformity is reduced by removing the struts from the PS cavity. Furthermore, the change in location of the <b>volute</b> <b>tongue</b> is shown to either substantially diminish or enhance the amplitude of velocity non-uniformity based on the relative position of the <b>volute</b> <b>tongue</b> and the struts. The study concludes that the velocity non-uniformity is dependent on the coupled effect of <b>volute</b> <b>tongue</b> and the strut position in the PS cavity...|$|E
40|$|A {{visualization}} {{method of}} aerodynamic noise source based on momentum in {{wake of a}} centrifugal impeller is proposed. The characteristics of the fan noise operated at the design point and the off design point are discussed by the visualization. When the flow rate changed from the design point to the off design point, the overall noise level of the fan has increased by 3 dB (A) because of the broadband noise. According to the visualization of aerodynamic noise source proposed by this study, it clarified that {{the domain of the}} flow related to the fan noise exists at the vicinity of the <b>volute</b> <b>tongue.</b> Since the flow almost flows out to the exit of the fan at the off-design, the large difference of the momentum in the wake occurred at the vicinity of the <b>volute</b> <b>tongue.</b> It is shown that the flow pattern at the vicinity of the <b>volute</b> <b>tongue</b> {{is one of the reasons}} for increasing of the fan noise...|$|E

40|$|Many pumping {{stations}} in drainage & irrigation applications are currently equipped with conventional (not fish friendly designed) pumps. Field tests {{have been performed}} [1] for several pump types of a certain size at certain pumping conditions to assess survival rates of fish passing through pumps. In order to compare different pump types of different sizes at different pumping conditions, a general criterion is required. Testing of fish friendliness of pumps is expensive and involves animal tests with living fish for which permits are required. Therefore, pump manufacturers prefer to perform fish friendliness tests for a single pump size. In order to convert such results to other pump sizes, a scaling law is desired. Van Esch [2, 3] made a first attempt to address scaling principles for fish friendliness of pumps. In {{the current study a}} general criterion is described to predict fish friendliness of pumps by means of models of mortality rates of fish passing through pumps. The criterion is validated with literature data [1 – 3] and experimental full-scale test data from the newly developed fish-friendly axial flow concrete volute pump by Flowserve with an impeller diameter of 850 mm. The full-scale tests involved a total of 1800 roach, perch and eel deployed over 7 pumping conditions, including 3 different heads and 5 different rotational speeds. The fish-friendliness criterion includes different aspects that together predict the survival rate of fish passing through pumps. The first and most important contributor is the impeller, which can have an axial, mixed or radial flow design. The criterion involves the leading edge shape of the blades. Secondly, the diffuser or volute is considered, which provides a strike probability with diffuser vanes or <b>volute</b> <b>tongue(s).</b> In case the gap between the trailing edge of the impeller vanes and {{the leading edge of the}} diffuser vanes or <b>volute</b> <b>tongue(s)</b> is small relative to the fish size, there is the possibility of a “scissor” effect. Research in the USA for fish friendliness of hydropower turbines [4 – 7] showed that shear velocity and pressure drops can be of importance. Also cavitation (involves pressure drop & vapor bubble implosions), recirculation and turbulence can influence survival rates. At this stage these flow effects are roughly captured using the pump performance curve. This way, extensive CFD calculations to evaluate detailed flow effects can be avoided. For open impellers, the gap between the impeller vanes and wear ring is included in the criterion. In addition, fish species-dependent effects are taken into account, since fish vary widely in their internal and external building plan. For instance salmonid, percid and cyprinid fish respond differently to the same pump design than for example eel. Sharp edges and rough surfaces (for example caused by cavitation, erosion or corrosion) can also be harmful to fish but are not included at this stage...|$|R

In order to improve a pump efficiency and to establish the optimum design method of a volute pump of very low specific speed around n_s= 60 ～ 70 [m, m^ 3 /min, rpm], several combinations of centrifugal impeller and volute casing were tested.

Three-dimensional numerical simulations of the complete unsteady flowfield in the whole impeller – volute configuration are performed to obtain the aerodynamic sound sources. Then, aerodynamic sound is calculated using the Lowson equation and compared with the measurements. Moreover, the fan is modified for noise reduction by increasing {{the distance between the}} impeller tip and the <b>volute</b> <b>tongue</b> and sloping the <b>volute</b> <b>tongue.</b> The sound levels of the modified fan are lower than those of the original one over almost the entire range of frequencies analysed. The blade passing frequency level of the modified fan is decreased by about 15 dB at the design point.

40|$|AbstractWith a {{decrease}} in orders for their regular standard cargo-pump for chemical tankers, Frank Mohn Fusa started developing a new cargo-pump for the Offshore Supply Vessel market. This meant designing a pump which both {{should be able to}} pump high viscous oil-emulsion and a fluid called drilling-mud, which is a mixture of salt-water and small particles of barite stone. The first test performed when the thesis started showed that their initial design would not withstand the erosion from the particles for a long enough period of time; this because both the pump impeller and the pump volute casing suffered from heavy erosion. This master thesis has the objective of first quantifying the erosion in the original design and then comparing the CFD-simulations with real physical tests. From these results, together with analytical estimations of the erosion on the components and in compliance with erosion and fluid mechanical theory, a recommendation for a new design will be given. CFD-results for this new design will also be given. There is also a focus on finding the areas where erosion often occurs. Recommendations for material choice and coating are given for the original design. The results from the impeller simulations show that there are still some unknown variables in the prediction of erosion in CFD. While the steady state simulation differs quite much from the physical test, the transient simulation gives a better prediction for the pump impeller. It is found that the boundary layer in the grid has a large influence for the prediction of particle erosion. For the impeller it is found that the new design is a better solution than the original open impeller in regards to erosion rates, both at full-load and in the best efficiency point, while they are almost equal at part-load. The result from the pumps volute casing gives a good representation of the measured erosion from the physical test. The <b>volute</b> casings inlet <b>tongue</b> in the original design is a region where design changes are needed, since it has a high erosion rate caused by high velocity and high impinging angle. The new volute casing designed in this thesis, where the volume expansion is changed from radial to axial, gives better results, having approximately three times less maximum erosion rate at the inlet tongue. The analytical model used in this thesis gives a good estimation for some of the surfaces, while others differs to some degree from the CFD calculations. This is mainly caused by forces acting on the particles that are not accounted for in the analytical model. </p...|$|R
40|$|The RNG k-ε {{turbulence}} model {{combined with}} cavitation model {{was used to}} simulate unsteady cavitating flows inside a double-suction centrifugal pump under different flow rate conditions based on hexahedral structured grid. The numerical external characteristic performances agree well with the experimental performances. The predicted {{results show that the}} turbulence kinetic energy and the turbulence dissipation rate inside the impeller at design flow rate are lower than those at other off-design flow rates, which are caused by various vortexes. Based on frequency-domain analyses in the volute casing, the blade passing frequency is the dominant one of the pressure fluctuations except the vicinity of <b>volute</b> <b>tongue</b> for all operating cases, and the dominant frequency near the <b>volute</b> <b>tongue</b> ranges from 0 to 0. 5 times the blade passing frequency for other off-design points, while the blade passing one near the <b>volute</b> <b>tongue</b> is the dominant one of the pressure fluctuations at design point. The increase of flow rate reduces the pressure fluctuations amplitude. For cavitation cases, the blade loading of the middle streamline increases a bit during the initial stage, but, for serious cavitation, the blade loading near the blade inlet reduces to 0 and even negative values, and the serious cavitation bubbles block the blade channels, which results in a sharp drop in pump head. Under noncavitation condition, the predicted power related to the pressure in the impeller channels increases from the inlet to the exit, while, under different cavitation conditions at the design flow rate, these power-transformation distributions in the impeller channels show that these power conversions are affected by the available NPSHa and the corresponding work in leading regions of the blades increases increases gradually a bit, and then it increases sharply in the middle regions, but it decreases in the blade trailing regions and is greatly influenced by secondary flows...|$|E

In order to improve a pump efficiency and to establish the optimum design method of a very low specific speed pump {{in the range of}} Ns< 100 [rpm,m 3 /min, m], eight kinds of centrifugal impellers were tested in the same volute casing designed at Ns - 60.

When the impeller stagger angle is 24 ° or 36 °, the distribution of pressure fluctuations in the volute casing becomes more uniform than the other impeller configurations, and the level of pressure fluctuation can be reduced by up to 50 %. Staggered impellers may redistribute the flow pattern at the region of the impeller outlet and affect the jet-wake flow field.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} presented regarding the unsteady pressure field within a high specific speed centrifugal pump impeller (vS 5 1. 7) which operated {{in a double}} spiral volute. For this, twenty-five piezoresistive pressure transducers were mounted within a single blade passage and sampled in the rotating impeller frame with a telemetry system. The influence of varying volume flux on the pressure transducers was evaluated in terms of pressure fluctuation magnitudes and phase differences. The magnitude infor-mation reveals that the pressure fluctuations from the impeller-volute interaction grew as the volume flux became further removed from the best efficiency point and as {{the trailing edge of}} the impeller blade was approached. These fluctuations reached 35 % of the pump head in deep part load. The upstream influence of the volute steady pressure field dominates the unsteady pressure field within the impeller at all off design load points. Acquired signal phase information permits the identification of the pressure field un-steadiness within the impeller passage as fundamentally synchronized simultaneously with the <b>volute</b> <b>tongue</b> passing frequency. Special emphasis was placed on the volume flux regime where the pump and impeller pressure discharge characteristic undergo hyster-esis, as impeller inlet and outlet recirculation commence and cease.

However, only limited studies regarding annular volutes are available, {{and there is no}} systematic design method for annular volutes. In this study, the influence of volute casing cross-sectional flow area on the hydraulic loss, pressure pulsations, and radial force under varying working conditions in a centrifugal ceramic pump are discussed in detail. Experimental tests were conducted to validate the numerical results. The results indicated that, when the volute casing flow area increases, the hydraulic performance decreases marginally under the rated working conditions, but increases at the off-design points, specifically under large flow condition. However, the volute casing with a larger flow area has a wider high-efficiency region. In addition, the increase in the volute casing flow area will decrease the pressure pulsations in the volute, regardless of the working condition, and decrease the radial force on the shaft, therefore, providing an improved pump operational stability. It is anticipated that this study will be of benefit during the design of annular volutes.|$|E

An initial grid topology has been identified and grids have been constructed for turbine inlet and discharge volutes. For CFD analysis of volutes to be used regularly, a procedure must be defined to meet engineering design needs in a timely manner. Thus, a compromise must be established between making geometric approximations, the selection of grid topologies, and possible CFD code enhancements. While the initial grid developed approximated the <b>volute</b> <b>tongue</b> with a zero thickness, final computations should more accurately account for the geometry in this region. Additionally, grid topologies will be explored to minimize skewness and high aspect ratio cells that can affect solution accuracy and slow code convergence. Finally, as appropriate, code modifications will be made to allow for new grid topologies in an effort to expedite the overall CFD analysis process...|$|E
40|$|A hybrid {{numerical}} {{method was}} {{used to calculate the}} flow-induced noise and vibration of the centrifugal pump in the paper. The unsteady flows inside the centrifugal pumps with different blade outlet angles were simulated firstly. The unsteady pressure on the inner surface of the volute and the unsteady force applied on the impeller were analyzed. Then the vibration of the volute and sound field were calculated based on an acoustic-vibro-coupling method. The results show that the pump head has increased 7 % while the hydraulic efficiency decreased 11. 75 % as blade outlet angles increased from 18 ° to 39 °. The amplitude of pressure fluctuation at the first blade passing frequency has decreased but increased at the second-order blade passing frequency as the angle growing. The total fluctuation power near <b>volute</b> <b>tongue</b> goes up about 12 % every 3 ° increment of blade outlet angle. The results also show that vibrating-velocity of the volute at second-order blade passing frequency is much higher than at other frequencies, and the velocity increases rapidly as blade outlet angle varies from 18 ° to 39 °. At the same time, the sound pressure level outside the pump has increased about 8. 6 dB when the angle increased from 18 ° to 39 °...|$|E
