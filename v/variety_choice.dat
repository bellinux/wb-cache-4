Powell, Eleanor Farrar, and David K. Cohen. The book is the second report from [...] "A Study of High Schools," [...] and is the successor volume to education reform leader Theodore Sizer's Horace's Compromise. Albert Shanker, {{former president of the}} American Federation of Teachers, called The Shopping Mall High School [...] "a sobering analysis of current conditions in our secondary schools and how they got that way." [...] In The Shopping Mall High School, the authors argue that high schools have come to resemble shopping malls in terms of <b>variety,</b> <b>choice</b> and neutrality. The book, often required reading for education majors in the 1980s and 1990s, exposed the realities of the comprehensive high school and set off a debate that would later incorporate themes about school vouchers and the marketplace.|$|E

40|$|Yield {{and protein}} content of wheat {{produced}} under organic standards was repeatedly {{shown to be}} between 20 and 40 % lower than levels achieved in conventional farming systems. This {{is thought to be}} at least partially due to insufficient N-supply to the crop later in the growing season and poor adaptation of the currently used wheat varieties to organic production conditions. To address these problems, a factorial field trial was established to study the effect of Rhizobium inoculation of clover seeds and application of compost amendments to clover swards grown prior to different varieties of wheat. Three winter wheat and four spring wheat varieties were chosen from a range of European breeding programmes. Results showed that <b>variety</b> <b>choice</b> had the greatest effect on yields, but that fertility management practices also significantly affected wheat yields and protein quality for some of the varieties. This clearly indicates that yields in organic wheat production can be significantly increased by improved <b>variety</b> <b>choice</b> and fertility management regimes...|$|E

40|$|Improving the {{introduction}} of new potato varieties requires aligning the preferences of all supply chain actors. In Ethiopia, the majority of ware potato growers source their seed from the informal supply system. Using a case study on specialised seed growers and a survey among ware potato growers and downstream chain actors, we explore the quality attributes that could influence the <b>variety</b> <b>choices</b> of farmers and downstream actors. Especially, we analysed the link between the seed and ware potato supply chains, farmers’ evaluation of local and improved potato varieties, and quality differences between the local and improved varieties. We found that farmers’ <b>variety</b> <b>choices</b> are well-aligned with traders’ preferences but varieties supplied by the specialised seed potato growers are not well accepted by ware potato growers. As a result, ware potato farmers continue to grow local varieties, which are inferior in terms of production-related quality attributes, but superior regarding market-related quality attributes. The results imply that enhancing production-related quality attributes is not enough to induce farmers to accept new potato varieties. We recommend breeding institutes and seed potato growers to put more emphasis on market-related quality attributes to enhance choice alignment in the full potato chain...|$|R
40|$|The Organic Standards require organic {{producers}} to use organic seed. However, a derogation {{can be obtained}} from certification bodies to allow the use of non organic seed where appropriate organic material is not available in the UK. An official database of organic seed availability, ‘Organicxseeds’, has been developed and is used as the basis for derogation decisions. However, {{there is a lack of}} information and a great deal of uncertainty in the minds of growers, about the performance of many varieties available in organic seed. This means that growers could potentially have to make <b>variety</b> <b>choices</b> on the basis little or no information. For the last 4 years, Organic Centre Wales, with support from Farming Connect, has coordinated a survey to help organic growers in Wales share information about the performance of varieties grown from organic seed. The survey (see Appendix I) was sent to all members of Farming Connect Horticultural Discussion Groups and other individuals who had responded in previous years or otherwise expressed an interest in the project.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of rice seed <b>variety</b> <b>choice</b> in Indonesia {{with respect to a}} meta-profit function. Varietal choice is modeled as depending on the profitability of high yielding varieties of seed relative to traditional varieties of seed, the schooling of cultivators and factors associated with yield uncertainty and risk aversion. Careful attention is paid to the stochastic structure of the estimated simultaneous equations switching regimes model. The maximum likehood method applied to Indonesian farm-level data is complicated by endogenous regressors and heteroskedastic errors. Adoption of high yielding varieties was found to be positively associated with its relative profitability, the likelihood of flooding, quality of irrigation conditional on its effect on relative profit, and the availability of credit, and negatively associated with land owned and the likelihood of drought. Schooling was not found to be a significant determinant of <b>variety</b> <b>choice.</b> Sources of interregional differences in cultivator behaviors in Indonesia were calculated as an application of the estimated model. Interregional differences in employment in rice cultivation but not HYV adoption were largely due to differences in wages. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} high quality hard wheats has been increasing. In this paper, factors {{affecting}} the supply and consistency {{of high quality}} wheats in Canada and North Dakota were compared and contrasted. Differences exist {{in the development and}} release of new varieties which affect the number and quality of hard wheats produced. Variety numbers and concentration were examined with a range of measures. Wheat area in Canada was found to be concentrated in fewer varieties than in North Dakota. These results were more apparent for durum than for hard red spring wheats. However, there was a trend toward more concentration in North Dakota and less in Canada. Protein, yield, and trade-offs were compared. Alberta appears to have a comparative advantage in the production of higher protein wheats. Farmers there have less of a yield loss penalty for increasing protein, compared to other regions. Varietal selection models were developed to analyze factors affecting <b>variety</b> <b>choice.</b> In Canada, agronomic factors including, relative yields, were significant variables affecting <b>variety</b> <b>choice.</b> In North Dakota, agronomic factors other than years since release generally had less effect on adoption rates. Varieties in North Dakota and Manitoba were found to have shorter life cycles and reached their maximum utilization by farmers faster than in Alberta or Saskatchewan.

40|$|BACKGROUND: With the {{increasing}} demand for high-quality foodstuffs and concern for environmental sustainability, late-season nitrogen (N) foliar fertilization of common wheat is now an important and widespread practice. This study investigated the effects of late-season foliar versus soil N fertilization on yield and protein content of four varieties of durum wheat, Aureo, Ariosto, Biensur and Liberdur, in a three-year field trial in northern Italy. RESULTS: Variations in low-molecular-weight glutenins (LMW-GS), high-molecular-weight glutenins (HMW-GS) and gliadins were assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). It was found that N applied to the canopy did not improve protein rate compared with N application to the soil (general mean 138 mg g− 1), but moderately increased productivity in the high-yielding varieties Liberdur and Biensur (three-year means 7. 23 vs 7. 13 and 7. 53 vs 7. 09 t ha− 1 respectively). Technological quality was mainly related to <b>variety</b> <b>choice,</b> Aureo and Ariosto having higher protein rates and glutenin/gliadin ratios. Also found was a strong ‘variety × N application method’ interaction in the proportions of protein subunits within each class, particularly LMW-GS and gliadins. A promising result was the higher N uptake efficiency, although as apparent balance, combined with higher HMW/LMW-GS ratio in var. Biensur. CONCLUSION: Late-season foliar N fertilization allows N fertilizer saving, potentially providing environmental benefits in the rainy climate of the northern Mediterranean area, and also leads to variety-dependent up-regulation of essential LMW-GS and gliadins. <b>Variety</b> <b>choice</b> is {{a key factor in}} obtaining high technological quality, although it is currently associated with modest grain yield. This study provides evidence of high quality in the specific high-yielding variety Biensur, suggesting its potential as a mono-varietal semolina for pasta production...|$|E
