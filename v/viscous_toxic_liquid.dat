40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{investigations of}} liquid ingress and vapour uptake in different porous media including textile fabrics and activated carbons, monitored {{by means of}} a unilateral NMR instrument. The aim of this work is to assess protective materials which prevent <b>toxic</b> <b>liquid</b> ingress and <b>toxic</b> vapour uptake from contaminating materials and personnel. A high performance fabric made of a combination of coated and not coated fibres can provide extremely high protection against <b>toxic</b> <b>liquids.</b> By incorporating an adsorbent layer between two highly repellent layers, an “intelligent” fabric that can prevent complete penetration through the composite system by toxic vapours can be constructed. This project was undertaken with a low-field unilateral profile NMR Mouse® (MObile Universal Surface Explorer) which can collect signal from a thin and flat sensitive volume (ca. 1. 5 cm x 1. 5 cm x 0. 6 mm) up to 10 mm above it, and in a non-invasive manner. The instrument uses a strong inherent magnetic field gradient (11. 38 T. m- 1) in conjunction with pulsed radio frequency waves. The method makes use of Fourier Transformed NMR in order to spatially resolve 1 D vertical profiles for each measurement over a field of view exceeding 500 µm and with a spatial resolution of 15 µm. One system investigated was a laminate heterogeneous layered fabric, made of a horizontal stack of three individual layers, each 70 μm thick, constructed from entangled fibres of 10 µm in diameter.

25|$|Researchers {{have also}} been experimenting with other methods, such as fumigation, injecting the mound, mound {{drenching}}, and surface dusting. Mound drenching entails pouring large volumes of <b>toxic</b> <b>liquid</b> into the mound. While this may affect {{a large portion of}} the mound, it is possible it may not reach the queen, thus preventing the destruction of the colony. Surface dusting is similar to mound drenching, except insecticides are applied on top of the mound and soak into the soil when wet. Mound injections use pressurising and injecting insecticides into the mound, but the queen may not be affected by this. Mounds can be eliminated effectively through fumigation. Broadcast treatment is sometimes used by spraying infected areas with agricultural equipment. Finally, spot treatment with insecticides can be used by drilling and injecting the mound with residual insecticide.|$|R

50|$|A {{nasogastric}} tube {{is used for}} feeding and administering drugs and other oral agents such as activated charcoal. For drugs and for minimal quantities of liquid, a syringe is used for injection into the tube. For continuous feeding, a gravity based system is employed, with the solution placed higher than the patient's stomach. If accrued supervision {{is required for the}} feeding, the tube is often connected to an electronic pump which can control and measure the patient's intake and signal any interruption in the feeding. Nasogastric aspiration (suction) is the process of draining the stomach's contents via the tube. Nasogastric aspiration is mainly used to remove gastrointestinal secretions and swallowed air in patients with gastrointestinal obstructions. Nasogastric aspiration can also be used in poisoning situations when a potentially <b>toxic</b> <b>liquid</b> has been ingested, for preparation before surgery under anaesthesia, and to extract samples of gastric liquid for analysis.|$|R
50|$|This game is {{a mixture}} between {{platformer}} and shoot'em up, with a look similar to popular computer video game Turrican.

At the beginning of each level, a map may be displayed by pressing the Help key (Amiga version). The player can jump, run, climb walls and use special weapons or items (keys to open certain gates) to master different sections of these levels. After losing a life, a replay is shown that can be fast-forwarded by holding the F10 key and the player can continue at any point by pushing the fire button; this was a unique and convenient feature because, like other Psygnosis titles, the game has a high degree of difficulty.|$|R

Significant deforestation has resulted due to this activity. In addition, techniques for gold mining {{have been described as}} resulting in both a major environmental and public health problem. Most gold miners use liquid mercury to extract gold particles from the alluvium. They often handle the <b>toxic</b> <b>liquid</b> mercury with their bare hands. To purify the gold particles, the mercury is burned off. After being vaporized, mercury particles contaminate the surrounding ecosystems. Mercury bioaccumulates throughout the food chain to become concentrated in top predators, such as large river fish and carnivorous birds. The local people may be harmed by direct contact with the element, as well as by ingesting dangerous levels of mercury when they eat the fish. Mercury results in a variety of neurological and congenital health problems.|$|R
40|$|Hypergolic fluids are <b>toxic</b> <b>liquids</b> that react spontaneously and violently {{when they}} contact each other. These fluids {{are used in}} many {{different}} rocket and aircraft systems for propulsion and hydraulic power including, orbiting satellites, manned spacecraft, military aircraft, and deep space probes. Hypergolic fuels include hydrazine (N 2 H 4) and its derivatives including monomethylhydrazine (MMH), unsymmetrical di-methylhydrazine (UDMH), and Aerozine 50 (A- 50), which is an equal mixture of N 2 H 4 and UDMH. The oxidizer used with these fuels is usually nitrogen tetroxide (N 2 O 4), also known as di-nitrogen tetroxide or NTO, and various blends of N 2 O 4 with nitric oxide (NO). Several documented, unintentional hypergolic fluid spills and fires related to the Apollo Program, the Space Shuttle Program, and several other programs from approximately 1968 through the spring of 2009 have been studied for {{the primary purpose of}} extracting the lessons learned.

40|$|Leachate dams store very <b>toxic</b> <b>liquids,</b> leachate, {{that contain}} {{a large amount}} of {{pollutant}} substances. Most of them are located in gullies or ravines, so if a dam breaks, leachate would advance downstream provoking an important environmental impact. In order to assess this environmental risk, the following procedure has been established: firstly, rating curves have been set up which relate characteristics of the dam with the environmental risk, secondly, a weight has been assigned to each parameter, and thirdly, the environmental elements which could be affected by the leachate have been assessed. Relating the risk generated by the characteristics of the dam with the environmental elements located in the risk area, the environmental risk index of a leachate dam can be calculated. If the environmental risk index exceeds a certain value, then it is a dam with a high environmental risk. A high value can be due to low geotechnical stability, to very sensitive environmental elements, or both. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
