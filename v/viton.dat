5|$|The {{chemically}} resistant (but expensive) fluorinated ionomers {{are used as}} electrochemical cell membranes, of which {{the first and most}} prominent example is Nafion. Developed in the 1960s, it was initially deployed as fuel cell material in spacecraft and then replaced mercury-based chloralkali process cells. Recently, the fuel cell application has reemerged with efforts to install proton exchange membrane fuel cells into automobiles. Fluoroelastomers such as <b>Viton</b> are crosslinked fluoropolymer mixtures mainly used in O-rings; perfluorobutane (C4F10) is used as a fire-extinguishing agent.|$|E
25|$|PCBs readily {{penetrate}} skin, PVC (polyvinyl chloride), and latex (natural rubber). PCB-resistant materials include <b>Viton,</b> polyethylene, {{polyvinyl acetate}} (PVA), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), butyl rubber, nitrile rubber, and Neoprene.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of ozone, only a few materials may be used like stainless steel (quality 316L), titanium, aluminium (as long as no moisture is present), glass, polytetrafluorethylene, or polyvinylidene fluoride. <b>Viton</b> may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity (humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation). Hypalon may be used with the restriction that no water {{come in contact with}} it, except for normal atmospheric levels. Embrittlement or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone. Ozone cracking is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like O-rings.|$|E
50|$|Given that information, {{researchers}} {{all over}} the world struggle to find a form of radio transmission that will kill <b>Vitons.</b> Graham continues to seek out clues, obtaining them from people that the <b>Vitons</b> kill. Eventually he gets the necessary information and a ray gun, built like an anti-aircraft gun, is set up and tested. Graham destroys dozens of <b>Vitons</b> before the gun is destroyed and he is nearly killed. All relevant information on the gun has been widely disseminated and more guns are built and put to use. Seeing <b>Vitons</b> being destroyed, people sober up and the war winds down. There’s a huge mess to clean up and plenty more <b>Vitons</b> to kill, but Humanity will prevail.|$|R
50|$|That knowledge, {{including}} Professor Bjornsen’s formula, {{is quickly}} {{spread around the}} world. The <b>Vitons</b> react by triggering an all-out world war. They enjoy a world-wide feeding frenzy as they work to regain control over their “cattle”. Chased into a hospital {{by a pair of}} <b>Vitons,</b> Graham and Wohl discover that the phantom vampires shy away from a machine that emits short-wave radio energy.|$|R

500|$|The best-known {{and most}} widely {{credited}} {{suggestion is that}} made by Ernst Tryde, a medical practitioner, in his book De döda på <b>Vitön</b> ("The Dead on Kvitøya") in 1952: that the men succumbed to trichinosis, which they had contracted from eating undercooked polar bear meat. Larvae of Trichinella spiralis were found in parts of a polar bear carcass at the site. Lundström and Sundman both favor this explanation. Critics note that the diarrhea, which Tryde cites as the main symptomatic evidence, hardly needs an explanation beyond the general poor diet and physical misery, but some more specific symptoms of trichinosis are missing. Also, Fridtjof Nansen and his companion Hjalmar Johansen had lived largely on polar bear meat {{in exactly the same}} area for 15 months without any ill effects. Other suggestions have included vitamin A poisoning from eating polar bear liver; however, the diary shows Andrée to have been aware of this danger. Carbon monoxide poisoning is a theory that has found a few adherents, such as the explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson. [...] The chief objection is that their primus stove had kerosene still in the tank when found. [...] Stefansson argues that they were using a malfunctioning stove, something he has experienced in his own expeditions. Lead poisoning from the cans in which their food was stored is an alternative suggestion, as are scurvy, botulism, suicide (they had plenty of opium), and polar bear attack. A combination favoured by Kjellström is that of cold and hypothermia as the Arctic winter closed in, with dehydration and general exhaustion, apathy, and disappointment. Kjellström argues that Tryde never takes the nature of their daily life into account, and especially the crowning blow of the ice breaking up under their promisingly mobile home, forcing them to move onto a glacier island. [...] "Posterity has expressed surprise that they died on Kvitøya, surrounded by food," [...] writes Kjellström. [...] "The surprise is rather that they found the strength to live so long" [...] (p.54).|$|E
2500|$|Hydrogen {{fluoride}} {{is generated}} upon combustion of many fluorine-containing compounds such as products containing <b>Viton</b> and [...] polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) parts. Hydrofluorocarbons in automatic {{fire suppression systems}} can release hydrogen fluoride at high temperatures, and {{this has led to}} deaths from acute respiratory failure in military personnel when a rocket-propelled grenade hit the fire suppression system in their vehicle. Hydrofluoric acid can be released from volcanoes, sea salt aerosol, and from welding or manufacturing processes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Vitón</b> {{was born}} in Cádiz, son of Ramón <b>Vitón</b> and María Isabel Santibañez. His father's family was {{originally}} from France. He had arrived around the year 1800 to Buenos Aires. [...] In 1806 and 1807, he served as Lieutenant of artillery during the British invasions of the River Plate. After the May Revolution, <b>Vitón</b> was confined to La Rioja Province. [...] Juan Bautista <b>Vitón</b> was married to Margarita López de Barrios Chiclana, niece of Feliciano Antonio Chiclana.|$|E

50|$|<b>Viton</b> O-rings {{have been}} used safely for some time in SCUBA diving by divers using gas blends {{referred}} to as nitrox. <b>Viton</b> is used {{because it has a}} lower probability of catching fire, even with the increased percentages of oxygen found in nitrox. It is also less susceptible to decay under increased oxygen conditions.|$|E

50|$|The {{performance}} of fluoroelastomers in aggressive chemicals {{depends on the}} nature of the base polymer and the compounding ingredients used for molding the final products (e.g. O-rings). This performance can vary significantly when end-users purchase <b>Viton</b> polymer containing rubber goods from different sources. <b>Viton</b> is generally compatible with hydrocarbons, but incompatible with ketones such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone, ester solvents such as ethyl acetate, amines, and organic acids such as acetic acid. O-rings made of <b>Viton</b> are typically color-coded as black, but new gaskets, seals and O-rings should be green FKM or black FKM, but with a green mark on the outer edge.|$|E
50|$|<b>Viton</b> {{fluoroelastomers}} are categorized {{under the}} ASTM D1418 and ISO 1629 designation of FKM.

The fluorine content {{of the most common}} <b>Viton</b> grades varies between 66 and 70%.|$|E
