5|$|Five North Korean Army (KPA) {{divisions}} massed {{around the}} city preparing to cross the Naktong River and assault it {{from the north and}} west.

5|$|Schwimmer {{concluded}} in 2002 that the feeding patterns of Deinosuchus most likely <b>varied</b> <b>by</b> geographic location; the smaller Deinosuchus specimens of eastern North America {{would have been}} opportunistic feeders in an ecological niche {{similar to that of}} the modern American alligator. They would have consumed marine turtles, large fish, and smaller dinosaurs. The bigger, but less common, Deinosuchus that lived in Texas and Montana might have been more specialized hunters, capturing and eating large dinosaurs. Schwimmer noted no theropod dinosaurs in Deinosuchuss eastern range approached its size, indicating the massive crocodilian could have been the region's apex predator.|$|E
5|$|The Age of Reason {{provoked}} a hostile reaction from most readers and critics, although {{the intensity of}} that hostility <b>varied</b> <b>by</b> locality. There were four major factors for this animosity: Paine denied that the Bible was a sacred, inspired text; he argued that Christianity was a human invention; his ability to command a large readership frightened those in power; and his irreverent and satirical style of writing about Christianity and the Bible offended many believers.|$|E

The main destination for the convoys was Auschwitz in German-occupied Poland.

5|$|The {{potatoes}} {{were chosen}} {{because they were}} deemed substantially equivalent to non-genetically modified Desiree Red potatoes. The study used two transgenic lines of potato, both with the GNA gene inserted. They were grown in the same conditions as the non-genetically modified parent plant. According to Pusztai, the potatoes were not substantially equivalent, {{as one of the}} transgenic lines contained 20 percent less protein than the other, and the starch and sugar contents <b>varied</b> <b>by</b> up to 20 percent among the three lines. Pusztai claimed that these differences were reason enough to discontinue further experimentation.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{combined}} {{data from}} SAMHSA's 2004–2005 National Surveys on Drug Use & Health, {{the rate of}} past-year alcohol dependence or abuse among persons aged 12 or older <b>varied</b> <b>by</b> level of alcohol use: 44.7% of past month heavy drinkers, 18.5% binge drinkers, 3.8% past month non-binge drinkers, and 1.3% {{of those who did}} not drink alcohol in the past month met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year. Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice as likely as females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).|$|E

5|$|It is most {{convenient}} {{to compare the}} various local weight standards by the metric weights of their ounces. The actual mass of an ounce <b>varied</b> <b>by</b> ±17% (5g) around the typical value of 30g. The table only shows approximate values for the most important standards; even the same nominal standard could vary slightly between one city and its neighbour. The range from 25g to 31g is filled with numerous variants, especially the Italian range up to 28g. But there is a relatively large gap between the troy ounces of 31g and the Habsburg ounce of 35g. The latter {{is the product of}} an 18th-century weight reform.|$|E
5|$|Like the Wii, the DSi {{can connect}} to an online store. The store, called the DSi Shop, {{allows users to}} {{download}} DSiWare games and applications, which are paid for with a Nintendo Points Prepaid Card (previously known as Wii Points Prepaid Card). Application prices follow a three-tiered pricing scheme. The service launched with the DSi Browser, a free web browser developed by Opera Software and Nintendo. A DSiWare trial campaign, whose expiration date <b>varied</b> <b>by</b> region, formerly offered 1,000 free Nintendo Points to each DSi that accesses the DSi Shop. As of June 2011, over 350 downloadable games were available, varying by region. Purchased DSiWare on DSi or DSi XL consoles cannot be transferred between units unless that console is repaired or replaced by Nintendo. Most DSiWare can be transferred to a 3DS, however saved data cannot.|$|E
5|$|The Hampton and Whitehall Turnpike Road Company was {{initially}} financed through 800 {{shares of stock}} valued at $20 each. Under {{the text of the}} act establishing the entity, only one toll gate was permitted on the turnpike. The toll charged at the gate <b>varied</b> <b>by</b> person; the exact amount was based on the vehicle used and the number of livestock and horses that were brought onto the roadway. By 1920, the turnpike company ceased to exist and the state of New York had plans in place to improve the portion of the turnpike west of the hamlet of East Whitehall. The improved road would be part of a state highway extending from the village of Whitehall to the Vermont state line at Fair Haven, Vermont. The contract for the project was awarded on April5, 1921, and the highway was completed by 1926.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of the mass spectrometer allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy. The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions, {{and the amount of}} deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge. The chemist Francis William Aston used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses. The atomic mass of these isotopes <b>varied</b> <b>by</b> integer amounts, called the whole number rule. The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the neutron, an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the proton, by the physicist James Chadwick in 1932. Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the Elementary Education Act 1870 (applying to England and Wales), commonly known as Forster's Education Act having been drawn up by William Edward Forster, created the concept of compulsory education for children under thirteen, although the decision to make education compulsory was {{at the discretion of}} school boards; education was compulsory in approximately 40% of schools by 1873. In areas where education was considered a problem, elected school boards could be set up. These boards could, at their discretion, create local by-laws, confirmed by Parliament, to require attendance and fine the parents of children who did not attend. There were exemptions for illness, living more than a certain distance (typically one mile) from a school, or certification of having reached the required standard (which <b>varied</b> <b>by</b> board) which were made mandatory across England and Wales by the 1880 Act.|$|E
5|$|The town's {{coat of arms}} {{depicts the}} old castle that used {{to stand on the}} site of the former prison. The royal purple {{background}} represents Dorchester's status as part of the monarch's private estate, a position held since before the Domesday Book was published. The shield is divided into quarters, two depicting lions and two fleur-de-lis. These are copied from the shields of the troops from Dorset who took part in the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. The fleur-de-lis have a scattered arrangement which shows that permission for the armorial bearings was given before 1405, after which date the rights were <b>varied</b> <b>by</b> King Henry VI. The inscription 'Sigillum Bailivorum Dorcestre' translates as 'Seal of the Bailiffs of Dorchester'. The mayor has a similar seal of office, but this has the inscription ' Dorcestriensis Sig : Maioris'.|$|E
