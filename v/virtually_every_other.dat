5|$|The {{international}} community’s {{political stance}} towards Kampuchea had a severe {{impact on the}} Vietnamese economy, which was already wrecked by decades of continuous conflicts. The United States, which already had sanctions in place against Vietnam, convinced other countries of the United Nations to deprive Vietnam and the People’s Republic of Kampuchea of much-needed funds by denying them membership to major international organisations such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In 1979 Japan stepped up the pressure by suspending all economic aid to Vietnam, and warned Vietnamese leaders that economic aid would only resume when Vietnam amended its policies towards Kampuchea, the Sino-Soviet rivalry {{and the problem of}} the boat people. Sweden, which was considered the staunchest supporter of Vietnam in the West, also considered reducing its commitments to the communist country as <b>virtually</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> country cancelled its aid.|$|E
5|$|With the {{appearance}} of both Ulysses and T. S. Eliot's poem, The Waste Land, 1922 was a key year {{in the history of}} English-language literary modernism. In Ulysses, Joyce employs stream of consciousness, parody, jokes, and <b>virtually</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> literary technique to present his characters. The action of the novel, which takes place in a single day, 16 June 1904, sets the characters and incidents of the Odyssey of Homer in modern Dublin and represents Odysseus (Ulysses), Penelope and Telemachus in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife Molly Bloom and Stephen Dedalus, parodically contrasted with their lofty models. The book explores various areas of Dublin life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Nevertheless, the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city, and Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt, brick by brick, using his work as a model. In order to achieve this level of accuracy, Joyce used the 1904 edition of Thom's Directory—a work that listed the owners and/or tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city. He also bombarded friends still living there with requests for information and clarification.|$|E

500|$|The self-titled debut album, Audioslave, was {{released}} on November 19, 2002, and entered the Billboard 200 chart at No.7 after selling 162,000 copies in its first week. It was certified gold by the RIAA within a month of release, and by 2006 achieved triple platinum status. It is the most successful Audioslave album to date, having sold {{more than three million}} copies in the United States alone. Despite its commercial success, Audioslave received mixed reviews. Some critics lambasted the group's effort as uninspired, and predictable. Pitchfork Media praised Cornell's voice, but criticized <b>virtually</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> aspect of the album, deeming the lyrics [...] "complete gibberish" [...] and Rubin's production [...] "a synthesized rock-like product that emits no heat." [...] Other critics, however, praised the supergroup's style reminiscent of 1970s rock and compared it to Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, saying they added much-needed sound and style to contemporary mainstream rock.|$|E
500|$|Among modern scholars, Sappho's {{sexuality}} is still debated – André Lardinois has {{described it as}} the [...] "Great Sappho Question". [...] Early translators of Sappho sometimes heterosexualised her poetry. Ambrose Philips' 1711 translation of the Ode to Aphrodite portrayed the object of Sappho's desire as male, a reading which was followed by <b>virtually</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> translator of the poem until the twentieth century, while in 1781 Alessandro Verri interpreted fragment 31 as being about Sappho's love for Phaon. [...] Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker argued that Sappho's feelings for other women were [...] "entirely idealistic and non-sensual", while Karl Otfried Müller wrote that fragment 31 described [...] "nothing but a friendly affection": Glenn Most comments that [...] "one wonders what language Sappho would have used to describe her feelings {{if they had been}} ones of sexual excitement" [...] if this theory were correct. [...] By 1970, it would be argued that the same poem contained [...] "proof positive of [...] lesbianism".|$|E
500|$|... "Vision of Love" [...] was lauded by {{contemporary}} music critics. While {{the production of}} the song was typical of late 1980s pop, the vocals were not, being much more showy and expressing a wider range than artists popular at the time such as Paula Abdul and Debbie Gibson. It has been credited with popularizing the use of melisma in modern popular music and for inspiring several artists to pursue a career in music. The New Yorker named [...] "Vision of Love" [...] the [...] "Magna Carta of melisma" [...] for its and Carey's influence on pop and R singers and American Idol contestants. Additionally, Rolling Stone said that [...] "the fluttering strings of notes that decorate songs like [...] "Vision of Love," [...] inspired the entire American Idol vocal school, for better or worse, and <b>virtually</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> female R singer since the nineties." [...] The song topped the singles charts in Canada, New Zealand and the United States, where it spent four weeks atop the chart.|$|E

40|$|In today's highly dynamic {{business}} environment, organisational {{creativity is}} one of the most important sources of competitive advantage. Although the unpredictability of creativity makes it difficult to plan for, it may still be possible to facilitate it given that we understand what affects it. In the first argumentative part of this paper, the author criticises the demand for organisational convergence often found in management literature and instead suggests seven other enabling factors of organisational creativity. Information technology's role in knowledge management-related activities have also been debated. While the technocrats often promote IT as the solution to <b>virtually</b> <b>every</b> KM-related problem, <b>others</b> claim that KM is fundamentally a people-related activity and warn of the IT-bias in today's KM approaches.

500|$|The first Scottish club {{to enter}} was Queen's Park, who {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} take part in the very first competition after a number of the clubs which had originally entered withdrew. [...] The Glasgow team were by far the dominant force in Scottish football, and no other team had even managed to score a goal against them. Because of a combination of byes and the withdrawal of opponents, [...] "Queen's" [...] reached the semi-finals without playing a match, but after holding Wanderers to a draw the Scottish club was forced to withdraw as the funds could not be raised to return for a replay. [...] The following season Queen's entered the competition again and, to ease the travelling expenses required {{to take part in}} a competition in which <b>virtually</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> team was based in the home counties, were afforded byes all the way to the semi-finals. [...] At this stage the club was drawn against Oxford University, whereupon the Scots withdrew from the competition, although one account states that Queen's in fact beat Oxford only to then withdraw as the team could not afford to travel to London for the final. [...] In 1873, the newly formed Scottish Football Association launched the Scottish Cup, but Queen's Park continued to enter the FA Cup draw, although for unknown reasons the club withdrew each time without playing.|$|E

The song received the Soul Train Music Award for Best R/Soul Single, Female and a Songwriter Award at the BMI Pop Awards.

Amongst science fiction characters, Jack also topped another AfterElton rundown of top characters, beating Hellblazers John Constantine for the top spot, commenting upon Jack's representation of a [...] "'post-gay' approach to sexual themes" [...] and awarding him a full 10/10 for cultural significance. For the AfterElton 2008 Visibility Awards, Jack won the award for Favourite TV Character. The website commented that [...] "unlike <b>virtually</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> TV sci-fi character, lead or supporting, Captain Jack is also openly bisexual.

[...] The third award won for Torchwood, after Favourite TV Drama and Character, was won by Jack and Ianto for Best Couple, for which the editor commented [...] "Torchwood is revolutionary not just because the producers dare to put openly bisexual (or in Jack’s case [...] "omnisexual") characters in the formerly sacrosanct setting of sci-fi; it’s also that it presents these bisexual characters in such an amazingly matter-of-fact way. There’s no apologiing, no minimiing, and no moraliing—just good, old-fashioned romance and adventure." ...|$|E
