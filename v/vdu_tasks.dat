40|$|Patterns of {{complaints}} of VDU operators {{have been studied}} in relation to work organization, workplace ergonomics and operators' eye quality. Host subjects worked on data entry and word processing. The percentage of working day with VDU (VDUTIME) varied widely among subjects. The relations found were generally weak. Eye fatigue appeared {{to be related to}} eye quality and to visual ergonomics. Musculo-skeletal complaints were related to postural ergonomics. An interactive relation was found between health complaints {{on the one hand and}} VDUTIME and the work pressure and work atmosphere experienced on the other. Operators' satisfaction with ergonomic features often correlated reasonably with our quality assessments. Many operators want more work variation and miss opportunity for choice in their <b>VDU</b> <b>tasks...</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of moving from single-occupancy offices to a landscape environment. Thirty-two visual display unit (VDU) operators reported no significant change in visual discomfort. Lighting conditions and glare reported subjectively showed no significant correlation with visual discomfort. Experience of pain was found to reduce subjectively rated work capacity during <b>VDU</b> <b>tasks.</b> The correlation between visual discomfort and reduced work capacity for single-occupancy offices was rs =. 88 (p =. 000) and for office landscape rs =. 82 (p =. 000). Eye blink rate during habitual VDU work was recorded for 12 operators randomly selected from the 32 participants in the office landscape. A marked drop in eye blink rate during VDU work was found compared to eye blink rate during easy conversation. There were no significant changes in pain intensity in the neck, shoulder, forearm, wrist/hand, back or headache (. 24 ≤ p ≤. 67). Pain levels in different body areas were significantly correlated with reduced work capacity,. 77 < rs <. 99 (p =. 000).

40|$|TNO and BMA Ergonomics are {{developing}} a so-called smart office chair. This chair is supposed to provide feedback on postures and movements during seated office work. The feedback should enable the user (i. e. the worker doing <b>VDU</b> <b>tasks)</b> to perform {{his or her work}} with less discomfort and in a more productive way. One part of this project is a study about the development of musculoskeletal discomfort during VDU work, sitting in various postures. Nineteen subjects did 2 types of VDU work in a laboratory setting: call-centre and data-entry. They were instructed to work in a certain sitting posture for 30 minutes, without pauses. After that, they could relax for 30 minutes. Four sitting postures were imposed; the 5 th one was each individual’s freely chosen working posture: the reference posture. Every 3 minutes, local perceived discomfort (LPD) of 5 body regions was determined, by letting subjects rate their LPD on a 10 -point-scale. From that we calculated the relative LPD-dose, setting the dose of the ergonomic optimal posture to 100 %. LPD-doses were not significantly different between the 2 VDU-tasks. Different sitting postures did lead to significantly different LPD-doses; the lowest in the ergonomic optimal posture and the highest one in the ‘vulture’ posture. From the individual development of LPD during 30 minutes of VDU work and a prior evaluation of the health risks of prolonged LPD, we can deduce the period of time a subject is allowed to work in a specific posture. These data can serve as input for a demonstration model of the smart office chair...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the {{accommodation}} facility after electronic visual display usage was used under two different surrounding lightings: one with and the other without room light. Accommodation facility is the capability of the eyes to respond and focus on visual stimuli at various distances, and could be measured clinically. Twenty young subjects participated in this study where the subjects were assigned to read binocularly from electronic visual display unit (VDU) for one hour under 2 different surrounding lighting conditions (with and without room light) at random sequence. Binocular accommodation facility was measured via standard clinical vision examination protocol using a ± 2. 00 DS lens flipper with 6 / 9 near visual acuity target. Friedman test showed no significant changes in binocular accommodation facility, [x 2 (2) = 5. 772,p= 0. 06 J. The difference in accommodation facility after one-hour <b>VDU</b> near <b>task</b> between the absence and presence of surrounding room light was negligible. Future studies should investigate the temporal aspects of the accommodation process during <b>VDU</b> <b>task</b> to understand the accommodation related VDU symptoms especially under low lighting...|$|R
40|$|In a Department of Salary Records where <b>VDU</b> <b>tasks</b> were {{performed}} {{at a high}} work rate, a participative ergonomic study was undertaken. First, the 'old' workplace was investigated for all 45 employees. Work stations appeared to be of poor ergonomic quality. Second, 12 employees participated in an experiment at the actual workplace. Objective and subjective effects were recorded under three conditions: the 'old' workplace, the recommended ('ideal') workplace, and the self-chosen workplace. Based on this data 'ergonomic' furniture and additional accessories were ordered and all 45 employees received tailor-made instructions and training {{with respect to their}} ideal workplace. After 5 months data for their 'objective' workplaces and subjective reports about the workplace were recorded. The study focuses on the comparison of the three conditions and of the two groups of employees: 33 who received thorough instruction and training only, and 12 who also participated in the experiment. Both objective and subjective improvements are demonstrated in the recommended situation when compared to the original situation. Although some employees deliberately chose to deviate from the recommended situation - owing to task and individual characteristics - self chosen workplaces still constituted a much better workplace in comparison to the old workplace. The 12 employees who participated in the experiment chose a better self-preferred workplace when compared to their 33 colleagues. It is concluded that experimental measurements in a naturalistic setting may contribute significantly to workplace improvements (1) by presenting adequate and 'objective' information for workplace improvement and ergonomic redesign, and (2) as a change agent itself, that is as an 'intensified treatment'. A participative ergonomic study was undertaken among employees of a Department of Salary Records. The employees were instructed and trained with respect to their ideal workplace. Experimental measurements in a naturalistic setting contributed significantly to workplace improvements by presenting adequate and objective information for improvements and ergonomic redesign, and as a change agent itself...|$|E
