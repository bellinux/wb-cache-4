40|$|This master thesis {{project was}} {{performed}} in collaboration with Scania CV AB, Engine Materials group. The purpose with the project was to investigate different ceramic TBC (Thermal Barrier Coating) thermal insulation properties inside the combustion chamber. Experimental testing was performed with a Single-Cylinder engine with TBC deposited on selected components. A dummy-valve was developed and manufactured specifically for this test in order to enable a water cooling system and to ease the testing procedure. The dummy-valve consists of a headlock, socket, valve poppet and <b>valve</b> <b>shaft.</b> Additionally, a copper ring is mounted between the cylinder head and the valve poppet to seal the system from combustion gases. Thermocouples attached to the modified valve poppet and <b>valve</b> <b>shaft</b> measured the temperature during engine test to calculate the heat flux. The TBCs consisted of three different materials: 7 - 8 % yttrium-stabilized zirconia (8 YSZ), gadolinium zirconia and lanthanum zirconia. The 8 YSZ TBC was tested as standard, but also with microstructural modifications. Modifications such as pre-induced segmented cracks, nanostructured zones and sealed porosity were used. The {{results indicated that the}} heat flux of 8 YSZ-standard, 8 YSZ-nano and 8 YSZ-segmented cracks was in level with the steel reference. In the case of 8 YSZ-sealed porosity the heat flux was measured higher than the steel reference. Since 8 YSZ-standard and 8 YSZ-sealed porosity are deposited with the same powder it is believed that the high heat flux is caused by radiative heat transfer. The remaining samples have had some microstructural changes during engine testing. 8 YSZ-nano had undergone sintering and its nanostructured zones became fewer and almost gone after engine testing leading to less heat barrier in the top coat of the TBC. However, for 8 YSZ-segmented cracks and gadolinium zirconia lower heat flux was measured due to the appearance of horizontal cracks. These cracks are believed to act as internal barriers as they are orientated perpendicular to the heat flow. During long-time (5 hour) engine tests the 8 YSZ-standard exhibited the same phenomena: a decrease in heat flux due to propagation of horizontal cracks. One-dimensional heat flux was not achieved and the main reason for that was caused by heating and cooling of the shafts outer surface. However, the dummy-valve system {{has proven to be a}} quick, easy and stable to perform tests with a Single-Cylinder engine. Both water-cooling and long-time engine tests were conducted with minor issues. The dummy-valve has been further developed for future tests. Changes to the <b>valve</b> <b>shaft</b> are the most remarkable: smaller diameter to reduce heat transfer and smaller pockets to ensure better thermocouple positioning. Another issue was gas leakage from the combustion chamber through the copper ring and valve poppet joint. The copper ring will be designed with a 1 mm thick track to improve sealing, hence better attachment to the valve poppet...|$|E

40|$|As {{the need}} to manage water {{resources}} increases, the ability to accurately measure use becomes crucial. In industry, measurement inaccuracies can cost either the supplier or consumer {{large amounts of money}} or even result in a depleted resource. Generally, flow meters need a flow profile to be fully developed to optimize measurement accuracy. In order to produce accurate measurements, most flow meters require a straight section of pipe immediately upstream of the meter. The straight pipe helps to develop the flow profile and produces flow conditions that are as ideal as possible. In many field installations, space restrictions lead to meters being installed with reduced straight pipe between a flow disturbance and the meter. Electromagnetic flow meters are referred to by several different names including: magnetic flow meter, mag meter or mag. The electromagnetic flow meter has grown in popularity in recent years as technology has improved and costs have decreased. Manufacturers commonly claim that their meters can produce highly accurate flow measurements, some as low as ± 0. 10 %, with reduced upstream straight pipe requirements as low as 0 pipe diameters between a disturbance and the meter itself. The results of this study provide quantified error associated with a partially closed butterfly valve on electromagnetic flow meter accuracy. The results show the effect of four valve openings (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 % open), at five locations downstream of the valve (1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 pipe diameters), and at two different meter orientations to the <b>valve</b> <b>shaft.</b> It was concluded in the study that twenty pipe diameters of length are required to produce accurate measurements (within the manufacturer’s specified accuracy) when a magnetic flow meter is installed downstream of a throttling butterfly valve. Surprisingly, the largest effect to the meter’s accuracy unexpectedly occurred when the upstream butterfly valve was fully open and not when it was in a throttling position...|$|E

40|$|Globe valves {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} types of valve used for {{throttling}} applications for all sizes due to better controllability and wider range. One of the major limitations associated with the use globe valves in liquid application is cavitation and it takes place both in part open and in fully open conditions due to varied reasons. There are different designs of globe valves available but for control valve applications, cage and plug designs are widely employed. Cage and plug design consists of body, valve cage, plug and an actuating mechanism. Actuating mechanism is connected to the valve plug which is a moving part, through <b>valve</b> <b>shaft.</b> There are many investigations reported about the flow visualization and numerical simulation of normal type globe valves. But study on valves with cage and plug design are not reported in detail. The objective of the present study is to provide a three dimensional analysis of flow through a globe valve with cage and plug design with emphasis on the inception and development of cavitation in detail. Cavitation reduction is achieved by breaking the flow in the form of more than one liquid jet, thereby increasing the turbulence inside the valve flow path. The numerical simulation was done using GAMBIT to set up geometry and grid and FLUENT to solve difference equation postulated from the conservation of mass and momentum of the fluid in motion. The k-epsilon model was used for turbulence. Results of five configurations of the cage with constant flow areas and valve stroke are presented in this paper. The numerical results were verified with an experimental program employing total flow measurement and pressure drop created by the valve at full opening. The study was conducted for different jet configurations to generalize the results of the study. Experimental validation was done in the water test facility with an operating pressure of 1. 6 MPa and flow rate of 0. 05 m 3 /s. In the study, total area of opening for the flow and the valve stroke were kept constant. Accelerometers and dynamic pressure sensors were employed to sense the severity of cavitation at different differential pressures across the test valve...|$|E
