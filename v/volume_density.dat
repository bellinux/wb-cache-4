5|$|Venus has an {{extended}} ionosphere located at altitudes 120–300km. The ionosphere almost {{coincides with the}} thermosphere. The high levels of the ionization are maintained only over the dayside of the planet. Over the nightside the concentration of the electrons is almost zero. The ionosphere of Venus consists of three layers: v1 between 120 and 130km, v2 between 140 and 160km and v3 between 200 and 250km. There may be an additional layer near 180km. The maximum electron <b>volume</b> <b>density</b> (number of electrons in a unit of volume) 3m−3 is reached in the v2 layer near the subsolar point. The upper boundary of the ionosphere—ionopause is located at altitudes 220–375km and separates the plasma of the planetary origin {{from that of the}} induced magnetosphere. The main ionic species in the v1 and v2 layers is O2+ ion, whereas the v3 layer consists of O+ ions. The ionospheric plasma is observed to be in motion; solar photoionization on the dayside, and ion recombination on the nightside, are the processes mainly responsible for accelerating the plasma to the observed velocities. The plasma flow appears to be sufficient to maintain the nightside ionosphere at or near the observed median level of ion densities.|$|E

In addition, the SR and T system in dystrophic fibers undergo changes in shape. The tubules of the free SR become much narrower; the T system becomes dilated and vesiculated. Dystrophic fibers, on the average, are much larger than normal but maintain the same sarcolemmal surface/fiber volume ratio as normal fibers.

40|$|Using {{a simple}} model of photodissociated atomic {{hydrogen}} on a galactic scale, {{it is possible}} to derive total hydrogen <b>volume</b> <b>densities.</b> These densities, obtained through a combination of atomic hydrogen, far-ultraviolet and metallicity data, provide an independent probe of the combined atomic and molecular hydrogen gas in galactic disks.

40|$|In this contribution, we test our {{previously}} published one-dimensional PDR model for deriving total hydrogen <b>volume</b> <b>densities</b> from HI column density measurements in extragalactic regions by applying {{it to the}} Taurus molecular cloud, where its predictions {{can be compared to}} available data. Also, we make the first direct detailed comparison of our model to CO(1 - 0) and far-infrared emission. Using an incident UV flux G 0 of 4. 25 (χ = 5) throughout {{the main body of the}} cloud, we derive total hydrogen <b>volume</b> <b>densities</b> of ≈ 430 cm- 3, consistent with the extensive literature available on Taurus. The distribution of the <b>volume</b> <b>densities</b> shows a log-normal shape with a hint of a power-law shape on the high density end. We convert our <b>volume</b> <b>densities</b> to H 2 column densities assuming a cloud depth of 5 parsec and compare these column densities to observed CO emission. We find a slope equivalent to a CO conversion factor relation that is on the low end of reported values for this factor in the literature (0. 9 x 1020 cm- 2 (K km s- 1) - 1), although this value is directly proportional to our assumed value of G 0 as well as the cloud depth. We seem to under-predict the total hydrogen gas as compared to 100 μm dust emission, which we speculate may be caused by a higher actual G 0 incident on the Taurus cloud than is generally assumed.

[...] As vehicles will be linked together with a resulting decrease in reaction times, the headway between vehicles could be reduced {{so that there is}} less empty space on the road. Available capacity for traffic would therefore be increased. More capacity per lane will in turn mean fewer lanes in general, possibly satisfying the community's concerns about the impact of roadway widening.
