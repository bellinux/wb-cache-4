25|$|The maximum shell {{length of}} this species is up to 12cm, but it more {{commonly}} grows up to about 9cm. The shell of Haliotis asinina has a distinctly elongated contour, in clear resemblance to a donkey ear, hence the common name. Its outer surface is smooth and almost totally covered by the mantle in life, making encrustations of other animals (such as barnacles) quite uncommon in comparison to other abalones. The shell of H. asinina presents 5 to 7 ovate open holes {{on the left side}} of the body whorl. These holes collectively make up what is known as the selenizone which form as the shell grows. Its spire is somewhat conspicuous, with a mostly posterior apex. The color may <b>variate</b> between green olive or brown externally, with distinct roughly triangular patches. As is the case in many other abalones, the interior surface of the shell is strongly iridescent, with shades of pink and green.|$|E

A simple random walk example is presented to illustrate the key ingredients of antithetic coupling for perfect sampling as well as its potential benefit. A key step in implementing antithetic coupling is to generate random <b>variates</b> that are negatively associated, a stronger condition than negative correlation as it requires that the <b>variates</b> remain non-positively correlated after any (component-wise) monotone transformations have been applied. For, this step is typically trivial (e. g., by taking and, where) and it constitutes much of the common use of antithetic <b>variates</b> in Monte Carlo simulation. Our emphasis is on because we have observed some general gains in going beyond the commonly used pair of antithetic <b>variates.</b> We discuss several ways of generating negatively associated random <b>variates</b> for arbitrary, and our comparison generally favors Iterative Latin Hypercube Sampling...|$|R

40|$|Sufficient {{dimension}} reduction methods provide {{effective ways}} to visualize discriminant anal-ysis problems. For example, Cook and Yin (2001) showed that the dimension reduction method of sliced average variance estimation (save) identifies <b>variates</b> that are equivalent to a quadratic discriminant analysis (qda) solution. This article makes this connection explicit to motivate the use of save <b>variates</b> in exploratory graphics for discriminant analysis. Classification can then {{be based on the}} save <b>variates</b> using a suitable distance measure. If the chosen measure is Mahalanobis distance, then classification is identical to qda using the original variables. Just as canonical <b>variates</b> provide a useful way to visualize linear discriminant analysis (lda), so save <b>variates</b> help to visualize qda—this would appear to be particularly useful given the lack of graphical tools for qda in current software.

2500|$|To {{display the}} intuition behind this statement, {{consider}} two independent Poisson processes, “Success” and “Failure”, with intensities p and 1nbsp&−nbsp&p. Together, the Success and Failure processes are {{equivalent to a}} single Poisson process of intensity 1, where an occurrence of the process is a success if a corresponding independent coin toss comes up heads with probability p; otherwise, it is a failure. If r is a counting number, the coin tosses show that the count of successes before the rth failure follows a negative binomial distribution with parameters r and p. The count is also, however, the count of the Success Poisson process at the random time T of the rth occurrence in the Failure Poisson process. The Success count follows a Poisson distribution with mean pT, where T is the waiting time for r occurrences in a Poisson process of intensity 1 - p, i.e., T is gamma-distributed with shape parameter r and intensity 1 - p. Thus, the negative binomial distribution is equivalent to a Poisson distribution with mean pT, where the random <b>variate</b> T is gamma-distributed with shape parameter r and intensitynbsp&1nbsp&−nbsp&p.
