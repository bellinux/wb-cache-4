25|$|The small tidy {{summit on}} the highest rock knoll bears a cairn. The view {{is limited by the}} circle of higher fells, but the <b>vista</b> <b>of</b> Buttermere backed by Great Gable is excellent. Crummock Water can also be brought into view by taking a few paces westward.|$|E
25|$|The {{summit of}} Middle Dodd bears a small cairn on a neat grassy top. There {{is also a}} small trench here of {{uncertain}} origin. The view is remarkably good given the looming presence of Red Screes, with a distant <b>vista</b> <b>of</b> the Scafells completing the picture.|$|E

25|$|The south summit has {{flashes of}} quartz in the {{uppermost}} rock and {{by far the}} better view. This takes in a fine <b>vista</b> <b>of</b> Windermere, the Coniston and Central Fells. The higher northern top bears {{the remains of a}} cross wall, some of this fashioned into a small cairn.|$|E
25|$|A {{passenger}} rail line that connected Detroit to Mt. Clemens {{along the shore}} was operational by the late 1890s, making Grosse Pointe more accessible. As the automobile became the primary method of transportation and the rail line decommissioned, the <b>vista</b> <b>of</b> what became Lake Shore Drive gradually improved. Lakeside estates are accessed from Lake Shore Drive and Jefferson Avenue.|$|E
25|$|Most of Massachusetts is forested. Even {{suburban}} eastern Massachusetts {{is heavily}} wooded. Trees tend to grow around houses in this region, such {{that when one}} looks out over eastern Massachusetts {{from the top of}} a high hill, one sees a <b>vista</b> <b>of</b> treetops, punctuated only occasionally by a church steeple, smokestack, or radio tower.|$|E

25|$|The {{summit of}} the fell bears a rash of stones {{although}} all else is grass. There is a windshelter at the highest point and a cairn {{a little to the}} north, marking the direction of Bowscale Tarn. The view of Blencathra and Sharp Edge is excellent, together with a surprising <b>vista</b> <b>of</b> the North Western Fells through the Glenderaterra gap.|$|E
25|$|Many cathedrals, {{because of}} their large size {{and the fact that}} they often have towers, spires or domes, have until the 20th century, been the major {{landmarks}} in cities or in views across the countryside. With highrise building, civil action has been taken in some cases, such as the Cologne Cathedral to prevent the <b>vista</b> <b>of</b> the cathedral from being spoiled.|$|E
25|$|Hunting scenes, {{especially}} those {{set in the}} enclosed <b>vista</b> <b>of</b> the reed beds of the Nile Delta from Ancient Egypt, can give {{a strong sense of}} place, but the emphasis is on individual plant forms and human and animal figures rather than the overall landscape setting. The frescos from the Tomb of Nebamun, now in the British Museum (c. 1350 BC), are a famous example.|$|E

25|$|The fair {{is noted}} as a {{showcase}} of mid-20th-century American culture and technology. The nascent Space Age, with its <b>vista</b> <b>of</b> promise, was well represented. More than 51 million people attended the fair, though {{fewer than the}} hoped-for 70 million. It remains a touchstone for many American Baby Boomers, who visited the optimistic fair as children before the turbulent years of the Vietnam War, cultural changes, and increasing domestic violence associated with the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E
25|$|The top of Burnbank Fell is {{a rounded}} grassy dome, the summit marked {{by an old}} fence post and small cairn. The Lakeland view is greatly {{restricted}} by Blake Fell {{although there is a}} <b>vista</b> <b>of</b> the Northern and North Western Fells. Loweswater is hidden by the slope although Crummock Water comes into view a few paces to the north east. The view of the coast, Isle of Man, Solway Firth and Criffel is uninterrupted.|$|E
25|$|The {{summit is}} a {{predominantly}} grassy plateau smoothly sloping away {{on all sides}} except to the north, where some shattered crags look down upon Southerndale. A small cairn marks the highest point. The view southward down Derwentwater is excellent, backed by a wide <b>vista</b> <b>of</b> fells from Clough Head to Sale Fell. Tewet Tarn on High Rigg is the only other significant visible body of water. Nearer at hand the grey flanks of Skiddaw and Little Man loom above the summit.|$|E

25|$|The {{designation}} of Banff {{as a national}} park marked {{a turning point in}} the public's perception of the Bow River. The river began to be appreciated for its aesthetic value in addition to its industrial and agricultural uses. Officials of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the company who led the development of Banff, realized this element. When work began on a new luxury hotel in Banff in 1886–87, Van Horne personally redesigned and reoriented the plans so that the guests of the hotel would be able to see the <b>vista</b> <b>of</b> the Bow River. Many early postcards from Banff, as well as some current ones, prominently featured the Bow River.|$|E
25|$|The highway {{begins at}} Maple Road {{north of the}} {{community}} of Bonfield, travelling north alongside a Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) track, curving northeast with a <b>vista</b> <b>of</b> a large swamp on the Kaibuskong River. It follows parallel to the river for its entire length, but is not within sight of it aside from here. The highway enters a forest and diverges from the railway, curving north. From here to its northern terminus, residences dot both sides of the highway, with coniferous forests between them. The route curves back to the northeast and travels straight for , ending at Highway17 next to a restaurant and motel.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a fine}} <b>vista</b> <b>of</b> West Cumberland, the Solway Firth and {{the hills}} of Scotland. Closer at hand {{the view of the}} fells is {{interrupted}} by Grasmoor and Crag Hill to the south and Hopegill Head to the east, although isolated groups of fells appear in the gaps. Crummock Water and Loweswater are brought into view by descending a little to the west. The ridge walk between Whiteside and Hopegill Head is ranked {{as one of the best}} in the district with Alfred Wainwright describing it as “an exhilarating high level traverse”; there are excellent views down into Gasgale Gill on the southern side.|$|E

25|$|One {{highlight}} of the estate is the outdoor Neptune Pool, located {{near the edge of}} the hilltop, which offers an expansive <b>vista</b> <b>of</b> the mountains, ocean and the main house. Due to drought conditions and leaks in the pool, it is now drained. The Neptune Pool patio features an ancient Roman temple front, transported wholesale from Europe and reconstructed at the site. Hearst was an inveterate tinkerer, and would tear down structures and rebuild them on a whim. For example, the Neptune Pool was rebuilt three times before Hearst was satisfied. As a consequence of Hearst's persistent design changes, the estate was never completed in his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Lung Fu Shan Country Park {{covers the}} densely vegetated slopes of Lung Fu Shan, {{including}} the disused Pinewood Battery and the Pinewood Garden picnic area, providing a scenic backdrop to the {{residential and commercial}} districts of Hong Kong Island. It is situated at the north of Pok Fu Lam Country Park. Towards the east of Lung Fu Shan Country Park is Hatton Road, to the south is Harlech Road whereas {{to the north and}} west is a covered conduit constructed by the Water Supplies Department. This country park covers an area of about 470,000m2 and also commands an excellent <b>vista</b> <b>of</b> {{the western part of the}} territory and the Victoria Harbour.|$|E
25|$|Castletown House & The Wonderful Barn. Located off {{the main}} street of nearby Celbridge, Castletown House is the first grand Palladian House in Ireland – the design of the {{building}} led to the construction of Leinster House and from thence to the White House in Washington, D.C.. Begun in 1722 by Speaker William Conolly (1662–1729), Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, the lands and the house itself lie in Celbridge, however there is also an entrance from Leixlip, hence there are two modern housing estates bearing the Castletown name, one in each town. To mark the eastern <b>vista</b> <b>of</b> Castletown a conical shaped building – The Wonderful Barn – was constructed in 1743 with the stairs ascending around the exterior of the building.|$|E
