5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} silver {{is composed}} of two stable isotopes, 107Ag and 109Ag, with 107Ag being slightly more abundant (51.839% natural abundance). This almost equal abundance is rare in the periodic table. The atomic weight is 107.8682(2) u; this value is <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> {{of the importance of}} silver compounds, particularly halides, in gravimetric analysis. Both isotopes of silver are produced in stars via the s-process (slow neutron capture), as well as in supernovas via the r-process (rapid neutron capture).|$|E
5|$|Workers who {{are older}} {{typically}} start satellite nests {{and have more}} developed ovaries. Younger and lesser-developed workers join the satellite after its establishment. The distribution of workers between the main nest and satellite is <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> they are needed {{for the establishment of}} the satellite and for the continued running of the main nest. Although, after several months the main nest can become abandoned. If not enough workers follow the initial worker to the new nest, then it will most likely fail as a satellite.|$|E
5|$|The Javan {{rhinoceros}} is {{a solitary}} animal {{with the exception}} of breeding pairs and mothers with calves. They sometimes congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud wallows. Wallowing in mud is a common behavior for all rhinos; the activity allows them to maintain cool body temperatures and helps prevent disease and parasite infestation. The Javan rhinoceros does not generally dig its own mud wallows, preferring to use other animals' wallows or naturally occurring pits, which it will use its horn to enlarge. Salt licks are also <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> of the essential nutrients the rhino receives from the salt. Male home ranges are larger at ²) compared to the female, which are around ²). Male territories overlap each other less than those of the female. It is not known if there are territorial fights.|$|E

25|$|Low {{level of}} actin in the nucleus {{seems to be}} <b>very</b> <b>important,</b> <b>because</b> actin has two nuclear export signals (NES) into its sequence. Microinjected actin is quickly removed from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Actin is {{exported}} at least in two ways, through exportin 1 (EXP1) and exportin 6 (Exp6).|$|E
25|$|These two {{chemicals}} were <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> they {{enabled the}} introduction of a host of other inventions, replacing many small-scale operations with more cost-effective and controllable processes. Sodium carbonate had many uses in the glass, textile, soap, and paper industries. Early uses for sulphuric acid included pickling (removing rust) iron and steel, and for bleaching cloth.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the {{seasonal}} cycle, the gynes mate with multiple males. Then, around November to December, the colony begins to senesce. At this point, the queens undergo diapause, which is a dormancy period to avoid the adverse environmental conditions of winter. During these months, only a few queens survive. Those that do typically exhibit larger overall body size, as well as a thin shape. However, specific genotypes and previous mating does not affect queen survival during this period. Queen survival is <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> those that survive diapause are able initiate a new colony in the spring.|$|E
25|$|First {{dates are}} {{designed}} to produce a number of relationship outcomes. (e.g., sexual partner, friendship, short-term romantic relationship, or life partnership.) However, as Mongeau says “the desired relationship outcome (if any) is, of course, not directly observable.” Mongeau quotes Theiss and Solomon, who have done many scholarly articles on dating, stating that first dates are <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> partners are both {{getting to know each}} other and attempting to establish a relationship definition as well. The three most common goals that people have on first dates are to reduce uncertainty, achieve relational escalation, and to have fun.|$|E
25|$|Behavioral {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} that sharks can take visual cues in order to discriminate between different objects. The bull shark is able to discriminate between colors of mesh netting that is present underwater. It was found that bull sharks tended to avoid mesh netting of bright colors rather than colors that blended in with the water. Bright yellow mesh netting {{was found to be}} easily avoided when it was placed {{in the path of the}} bull shark. This was found to be the reason that sharks are attracted to bright yellow survival gear rather than ones that were painted black. This is <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> it gives an insight into how bull sharks are able to pick up certain visual keys underwater that might give them an advantage when seeking out certain prey.|$|E

25|$|The {{measured}} {{capacity of}} refrigeration is always dimensioned in units of power. Domestic and commercial refrigerators may be rated in kJ/s, or Btu/h of cooling. For {{commercial and industrial}} refrigeration systems, {{most of the world}} uses the kilowatt (kW) as the basic unit of refrigeration. Typically, commercial and industrial refrigeration systems in North America are rated in tons of refrigeration (TR). Historically, one TR was defined as the energy removal rate that will freeze one short ton of water at 0°C (32°F) in one day. This was <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> many early refrigeration systems were in ice houses. The simple unit allowed owners of these early refrigeration systems to measure a day's output of ice against energy consumption, and to compare their plant to one down the street. While ice houses make up a much smaller part of the refrigeration industry than they once did, the unit TR has remained in North America. The unit's value as historically defined was approximately 11,958 Btu/hr (3.505kW), and has now been conventionally redefined as exactly 12,000 Btu/hr (3.517kW).|$|E
500|$|The actual {{efficacy}} of jury consultants {{may not be}} <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> the demographic composition of the jury has {{little effect on the}} verdict it renders, usually causing only a 5%–15% variance in verdicts. The evidence presented at trial has far more impact on what the verdict will be. As Kressel and Kressel indicate, [...] "when the evidence is strong, nothing else matters much" [...] and even when the evidence is ambiguous, demographic characteristics of jurors are a relatively minor influence. Some researchers argue that a significant improvement in jury selection, however small, may be worthwhile when the stakes are high, like for a defendant accused of a capital crime or a corporation that stands to lose millions of dollars in a civil suit.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} notable {{in that it}} was the first episode of the series to confirm Agent Scully's cancer. Reportedly, when Chris Carter {{informed}} Gillian Anderson that her character would be diagnosed with cancer, she was [...] "delighted" [...] that {{she would be able to}} play her character in a different way. John Shiban considers the episode to be [...] "a great X-Files story" [...] and <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> it established the story-arc featuring Scully's cancer. However, the audience receives an early indication of Scully's cancer in the episode [...] "Unruhe" [...] (which aired earlier in the same season, also written by Vince Gilligan), when Gerry Schnauz kidnaps her in the episode and says he can see Scully's [...] "unrest", and points to the bridge of her nose–exactly where her cancer would be.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the biggest}} story arcs of the third season was the romance between Leslie and Ben, which slowly {{developed}} throughout the series until they officially began dating in the episode [...] "Road Trip" [...] despite a strict policy against workplace dating at city hall. The development of Ben's feelings for Leslie coincide with his growing appreciation for Pawnee; the character never had a firm sense of home due to the excessive amount of traveling with his job, but throughout the season Ben gradually {{falls in love with}} the town due to the optimism and enthusiasm Leslie Knope shows for Pawnee and her job. The no-dating policy, imposed by Chris, stemmed from real life policies in small town governments, which Schur said were considered <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> [...] "these people are handling taxpayer money, so relationships are even more frowned upon than they are in the private sector". During the season finale [...] "Li'l Sebastian", Leslie is encouraged by political operatives to run for office, but is asked whether there any potential scandals that could risk becoming public. Leslie denies there are any, but it is suggested her secret relationship with Ben could become such a scandal.|$|E

2500|$|The lunar {{regolith}} is <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>because</b> it also stores {{information about}} the history of the Sun. The atoms that compose the solar wind [...] mostly helium, neon, carbon and nitrogen [...] hit the lunar surface and insert themselves into the mineral grains. Upon analyzing the composition of the regolith, particularly its isotopic composition, it is possible to determine if the activity of the Sun has changed with time. The gases of the solar wind could be useful for future lunar bases, because oxygen, hydrogen (water), carbon and nitrogen are not only essential to sustain life, but are also potentially very useful in the production of fuel. The composition of the lunar regolith can also be used to infer its source origin.|$|E
