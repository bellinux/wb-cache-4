5|$|Other sources include {{fortified}} food and dietary supplements in various forms. A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide, {{one of the}} most common supplements in the United States, and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body. This review cited studies that found lower plasma zinc concentrations in the subjects who consumed zinc oxide and zinc carbonate than in those who took zinc acetate and sulfate salts. For fortification, however, a 2003 review recommended cereals (containing zinc oxide) as a cheap, stable source that is as easily absorbed as the more expensive forms. A 2005 study found that <b>various</b> <b>compounds</b> of zinc, including oxide and sulfate, did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as fortificants to maize tortillas.|$|E
5|$|Early {{researchers}} tasted beryllium and its <b>various</b> <b>compounds</b> for sweetness {{in order}} to verify its presence. Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt {{should be made to}} ingest this highly toxic substance. Beryllium and its compounds should be handled with great care and special precautions must be taken when carrying out any activity which could result in the release of beryllium dust (lung cancer is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium-laden dust). Although the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.|$|E

5|$|Neptunium's unique {{radioactive}} characteristics {{allowed it}} to be traced as it moved through <b>various</b> <b>compounds</b> in chemical reactions, at first {{this was the only}} method available to prove that its chemistry was different from other elements. As the first isotope of neptunium to be discovered has such a short half-life, McMillan and Abelson were unable to prepare a sample that was large enough to perform chemical analysis of the new element using the technology that was then available. However, after the discovery of the long-lived 237Np isotope in 1942 by Glenn Seaborg and Arthur Wahl, forming weighable amounts of neptunium became a realistic endeavor. Its half-life was initially determined to be about 3millionyears (later revised to 2.144millionyears), confirming the predictions of Nishina and Kimura of a very long half-life.|$|E

25|$|The {{resulting}} case-hardened part {{may show}} distinct surface discoloration, if the carbon material is mixed organic matter as described above. The steel darkens significantly, and shows a mottled pattern of black, blue and purple, {{caused by the}} <b>various</b> <b>compounds</b> formed from impurities in the bone and charcoal.

25|$|The {{architecture}} {{is adapted to}} the mountains. Approximately 200 buildings are arranged on wide parallel terraces around an east-west central square. The <b>various</b> <b>compounds,</b> called kanchas, are long and narrow in order to exploit the terrain. Sophisticated channeling systems provided irrigation for the fields. Stone stairways set in the walls allowed access to the different levels across the site. The eastern {{section of the city}} was probably residential. The western, separated by the square, was for religious and ceremonial purposes. This section contains the Torreón, the massive tower which may have been used as an observatory.|$|E
25|$|Possessing the apoE ε4 allele {{has been}} {{associated}} with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. ApoE is a protein that is involved in the transport of many lipids, including cholesterol, and thus, regulates how much sulfatide is in the central nervous system and mediates the homeostasis of the system. It has been found that higher levels of apoE are positively correlated with greater sulfatide depletion. ApoE-associated proteins take sulfatide from the myelin sheath and then degrade sulfatide into <b>various</b> <b>compounds,</b> such as sulfate. When apoE is increased, the amount of sulfatide that is taken from the myelin sheath is also increased; hence, there is more sulfatide depletion.|$|E
25|$|In 1803, while {{examining}} mineral samples {{sent to him}} by the Purísima del Cardenal mine in Zimapán in {{the state}} of Hidalgo, del Río arrived at the conclusion that he had found a new metallic element. He prepared <b>various</b> <b>compounds</b> of the element, and observing their diverse colors, he named the element pancromium. Later, on observing that the compounds changed color to red on heating, he substituted the name eritronium for the element. (Eritros means red in Greek.) The following year he gave samples containing the new element to Alexander von Humboldt, who sent them on to Hippolyte Victor Collet-Descotils in París for his analysis. Collet-Descotils's analysis found (mistakenly) that the samples contained only chromium. Humboldt, in turn, rejected del Río's claim of the discovery of a new element, and del Río himself concluded his discovery had been an error.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century <b>various</b> <b>compound</b> {{locomotives}} were tried, particularly of the Vauclain and tandem patterns.

25|$|Mallory {{described}} the reagent now generally known as PTAH in 1897. PTAH stains tissues either reddish brown or blue {{depending on their}} type. This property of simultaneously staining two different colours is different from other haematoxylin reagents e.g. alum-haematoxylin. The role of phosphotungstic acid and the mechanism of staining is not fully understood. Interestingly the active component of haematoxylin is the oxidised form, haematin, although this rarely acknowledged in the literature which refer to haematoxylin staining. Phosphotungstic acid forms a lake with haematin. The make –up of the reagent is uncertain, examination of a year old sample showed there to be three coloured components, blue, red and yellow. These were not identified. Some investigations of “model” systems, reacting <b>various</b> <b>compounds</b> such as amino acids, purines, pyrimidines and amines with PTAH show that they give rise to different colours.|$|E
25|$|Silks, {{as well as}} {{many other}} biomaterials, have a {{hierarchical}} structure (e.g., cellulose, hair). The primary structure is its amino acid sequence, mainly consisting of highly repetitive glycine and alanine blocks, which is why silks are often referred to as a block co-polymer. On a secondary structure level, the short side chained alanine is mainly found in the crystalline domains (beta sheets) of the nanofibril, glycine is mostly found in the so-called amorphous matrix consisting of helical and beta turn structures. It is the interplay between the hard crystalline segments, and the strained elastic semi-amorphous regions, that gives spider silk its extraordinary properties. <b>Various</b> <b>compounds</b> other than protein are used to enhance the fibre's properties. Pyrrolidine has hygroscopic properties which keeps the silk moist while also warding off ant invasion. It occurs in especially high concentration in glue threads. Potassium hydrogen phosphate releases protons in aqueous solution, resulting in a pH of about 4, making the silk acidic and thus protecting it from fungi and bacteria that would otherwise digest the protein. Potassium nitrate is believed to prevent the protein from denaturing in the acidic milieu.|$|E
500|$|Analysis of the Voyager images led {{scientists}} {{to believe that}} these flows were composed mostly of <b>various</b> <b>compounds</b> of molten sulfur. However, subsequent Earth-based infrared studies and measurements from the Galileo spacecraft indicate that these flows are composed of basaltic lava with mafic to ultramafic compositions. This hypothesis is based on temperature measurements of Io's [...] "hotspots", or thermal-emission locations, which suggest temperatures of at least 1300K and some as high as 1600K. Initial estimates suggesting eruption temperatures approaching 2000K have since proven to be overestimates because the wrong thermal models were used to model the temperatures.|$|E

Atoms can also combine to create materials that do not consist of discrete molecules, including crystals and liquid or solid metals. This atomic matter forms networked arrangements that lack the particular type of small-scale interrupted order associated with molecular matter.|$|E
