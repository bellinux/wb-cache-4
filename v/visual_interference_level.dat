Birds were trained on a delayed matching-to-sample (DMS) task under either common outcome or differential outcome conditions, and then presented with <b>visual</b> <b>interference</b> during the delay period. Consistent with previous literature, the common outcomes birds were slower to learn the DMS task than the differential outcomes birds. The common outcome birds were also more impaired by the <b>visual</b> <b>interference</b> than the differential outcomes birds. Our findings are consistent with the view that the birds trained with common outcomes were likely remembering the sample stimulus during the delay period, and hence were disrupted by the <b>visual</b> <b>interference,</b> whereas the birds trained with differential outcomes were likely relying on the different emotional reactions elicited by the different outcomes to guide their choice behaviour, and hence were less affected by the <b>visual</b> <b>interference.</b> Our findings suggest that the DOE is not truly evidence of anticipatory mediation of short-term retention in pigeons, but rather emotionally driven decision making, which is not truly anticipatory in nature...|$|R

40|$|Visual {{working memory}} (VWM) has a limited capacity. This {{limitation}} can be mitigated {{by the use}} of focused attention: if attention is drawn to the relevant working memory content before test, performance improves (the so-called retro-cue benefit). This study tests 2 explanations of the retro-cue benefit: (a) Focused attention protects memory representations from <b>interference</b> by <b>visual</b> input at test, and (b) focusing attention enhances retrieval. Across 6 experiments using color recognition and color reproduction tasks, we varied the amount of color interference at test, and the delay between a retrieval cue (i. e., the retro-cue) and the memory test. Retro-cue benefits were larger when the memory test introduced interfering visual stimuli, showing that the retro-cue effect is in part because of protection from <b>visual</b> <b>interference.</b> However, when <b>visual</b> <b>interference</b> was held constant, retro-cue benefits were still obtained whenever the retro-cue enabled retrieval of an object from VWM but delayed response selection. Our results show that accessible information in VWM might be lost in the processes of testing memory because of <b>visual</b> <b>interference</b> and incomplete retrieval. This is not an inevitable state of affairs, though: Focused attention can be used {{to get the most out}} of VWM. (PsycINFO Database Recor...|$|R
30|$|The {{pseudo code}} of the TLS {{algorithm}} is presented in Algorithm 2. It is used for selecting the tuple link l_pi^x that brings minimum interference to the tuple links in H_ 0 ^t. Line 1 examines the initial conditions for each selection. The algorithm starts when the transmitter and receiver own idle radios. Line 2 selects the tuple link l_pi^x with minimum interference to the tuple links in H_ 0 ^t according to the cumulative <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> I_qj^y. With different l_pi^x∉H_ 0 ^t, it calculates the cumulative <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> I_qj^y for each tuple link l_qj^y in H_ 0 ^t∪{l_pi^x} and obtains the maximum value. Thus, it gets a maximum cumulative <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> set.

40|$|Difficulty with {{selective}} {{attention is}} a frequent complaint of adult patients with ADHD, but selective attention tasks have not provided robust evidence of attentional dysfunction in this group. Two experiments examine this puzzle by distinguishing between failures of spatial selection and problems due to sensitivity to perceptual interference. In Experiment 1, we measured the <b>level</b> of perceptual <b>interference</b> generated by targets in crowded displays with nearby distractors by comparing luminance thresholds in both distractor-present (noise) and distractor-absent (clean) displays. ADHD and control participants had comparable thresholds for clean displays, but ADHD individuals had elevated thresholds to crowded displays. These effects could be explained in two distinct ways. Deficits may have arisen from amplified <b>visual</b> <b>interference</b> in the noise condition, or from abnormalities in top-down attentional processes that reduce <b>visual</b> <b>interference.</b> Experiment 2 adjusted for individual perceptual differences with clean and noise displays, before measuring <b>visual</b> <b>interference</b> resolution at attended versus unattended locations. ADHD and control groups had comparable interference resolution at attended locations. These results suggest that perceptual interference rather than spatial attention deficits may account for some deficits in ADHD. This putative deficit in sensory function highlights a potential early-stage perceptual processing deficit in ADHD distinct from selective attention. (JINS, 2012, 18, 1 – 10...|$|R

However, defining one common average <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> is highly inefficient, since the interference strongly varies with the distance (or channel) between the interferer and the interfered node.

The thesis comprises a Borland C++ simulation programs to study the performance of the spread slotted Aloha access scheme. The first simulation programs simulate the capacity of the uplink channel for a mobile satellite system model which uses the spread slotted Aloha access scheme, and another simulation programs to simulate the throughput of the spread slotted Aloha multiple access scheme for the same system model. The outcome of the simulation shows that the uplink channel capacity is a soft capacity because it depends on the <b>interference</b> <b>level,</b> as the <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> increases the capacity of the channel is decreases and vise versa. The <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> depends on the number of the users on the system and also depends on the user bit rate, as the bit rate increases the channel load factor increases then the channel soft capacity increases. The throughput of the spread slotted Aloha scheme increases as the number of the users on the system increases but also the <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> is increasing, and if the <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> reaches a threshold (which depends on the system multiple access capability) the throughput of the system begins to decrease.

40|$|Abstract—The co-channel {{interference}} problem in wireless mesh networks is extremely serious {{due to the}} heavy aggregated traffic loads and limited available channels. It is preferable for mesh routers to dynamically switch channels according to the accurate estimation of co-channel <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> in the neighborhood. Most developed interference estimation schemes, however, do not consider the impact of interface switching. Furthermore, the interference between wireless nodes has been extensively considered as an all-or-nothing event. In this paper, we develop a weighted interference estimation scheme (WIES) for interface switching wireless mesh networks. WIES takes {{a new version of}} multi-interface conflict graph to estimate the interference relationships between nodes/links. Besides, WIES uses a weight to estimate the <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> of a node/link on another one. The weight utilizes two empirical functions to denote the impacts of the relative distance between mesh nodes and characteristics of traffic loads in wireless mesh networks. Extensive NS 2 simulations show that WIES achieves significant performance improvements, especially when the <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> of the network is high. We also validate that the <b>interference</b> <b>level</b> of networks is affected by the system parameters such as the number of available channels and the ratio between interference range and transmission range.

The results show that there is a trade-off between short and long interference observation (measurement) interval.
