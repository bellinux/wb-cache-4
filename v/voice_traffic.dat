Etisalat operates Points of Presence (PoP) in New York, London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Paris and Singapore. In December 2011 Etisalat announced the commercial launch of Etisalat 4G LTE Network.|$|E
25|$|Internet {{telephony}} {{is another}} common communications service {{made possible by}} the creation of the Internet. VoIP stands for Voice-over-Internet Protocol, referring to the protocol that underlies all Internet communication. The idea began in the early 1990s with walkie-talkie-like voice applications for personal computers. In recent years many VoIP systems have become as easy to use and as convenient as a normal telephone. The benefit is that, as the Internet carries the <b>voice</b> <b>traffic,</b> VoIP can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for those with always-on Internet connections such as cable or ADSL. VoIP is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service. Interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. Simple, inexpensive VoIP network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer.|$|E
50|$|IXCs {{originally}} carried <b>voice</b> <b>traffic</b> on analog lines, but <b>voice</b> <b>traffic</b> {{has since}} become largely digitized. Therefore, <b>voice</b> <b>traffic</b> is more typically a data stream and can be intermixed with data traffic such as uplinks for DSL. Most commonly, links between IXCs and COs are ATM links carried on optical fiber.|$|E

30|$|We will derive two approaches: a {{deterministic}} approach considering full {{knowledge of}} the traffic profile throughout the day, and a statistical robust strategy accounting for error traffic modeling. For the deterministic procedure, we develop a method that assumes either a single type of <b>traffic</b> (<b>voice)</b> or mixed <b>traffic</b> (<b>voice</b> and data). The decision of switching on and off carriers {{will be based on}} a threshold applied to the traffic demand at each hour of the day.|$|R

In UTRA-TDD, packets with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements need to be managed. We formulate the downlink packet scheduling problem in terms of dynamic programming by taking into account all the allocation constraints. Hence, we define a frame-by-frame exact downlink scheduling algorithm to support Web interactive and <b>voice</b> <b>traffics,</b> named 2 -class Optimal Packet Scheduling (2 OPS).

5000|$|Call Admission Control (CAC) {{prevents}} oversubscription of VoIP networks. It {{is used in}} {{the call}} set-up phase and applies to real-time media traffic as opposed to data traffic. CAC mechanisms complement and are distinct from the capabilities of Quality of Service tools to protect <b>voice</b> <b>traffic</b> from the negative effects of other <b>voice</b> <b>traffic</b> and to keep excess <b>voice</b> <b>traffic</b> off the network. Since it averts <b>voice</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion, it is a preventive Congestion Control Procedure. It ensures that there is enough bandwidth for authorized flows.|$|E
