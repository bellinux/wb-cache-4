40|$|A {{detailed}} {{cost analysis}} was performed on 111 U. S. Forest Service campgrounds in the Pacific Northwest (Region 6). Five experience levels were analyzed to estimate facility, operation and maintenance, and opportunity costs. Cost functions, estimated by multiple linear regression analysis to predict the effect of size (number of sites) and use, should help planners better predict average costs of both existing campgrounds and new developments for each experience level. Total annual costs per campground ranged from 800 (experience level 1) to 65, 000 (experience level 5) at a 10 -percent interest rate. Costs averaged 1. 53 per recreation <b>visitor-day</b> and 886 per site across all experience levels...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{describe}} a consistent and theoretically sound methodology for evaluating nonmarket uses of forest resources, particularly {{those associated with}} recreation. The analytical methodology is applied to a forest management unit. Present net worth of developed campgrounds and dispersed recreation activities on Oregon State Department of Forestry Lands in 1977 were estimated as 4. 26 and 7. 92 per <b>visitor-day,</b> respectively. Although these results are unique to the resource base analyzed, the application typifies the procedures employed, the type of data required, {{and the kinds of}} answers the technique can provide. The model can easily be adapted to different situations by changing assumptions and conditions...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are (1) to compare the costs of providing camping among different types of U. S. Forest Service developed campgrounds in Oregon and Washington and (2) to help determine possible policy implications regarding future management in relation to costs of providing the various campground facilities. To meet these two objectives a model is developed to estimate the short-run campground management cost functions. The model is structured to represent the total cost of managing a campground {{as a function of the}} degree of development of the campground and either annual campground use level or the number of sites on the campground as the quantity variable. The average total management cost per recreational <b>visitor-day</b> was estimated as 1. 53 and the cost per campsite was estimated as 886. 09. From the estimated model two conclusions are drawn; (1) the average U. S. F. S. campground in Region Six is managed at levels below the point of maximum economic efficiency and (2) the use fee that is charged at fee campgrounds plays an insufficient role in helping to cover total management costs...|$|E
50|$|Lake McClure is also {{extensively}} {{developed for}} recreational activities, with 515 campsites, four boat ramps and two marinas. In 1992, the lake received 606,000 <b>visitor-days,</b> mostly from May to September.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Australian Great Barrier Reef is {{a natural}} wonder of our world and a {{registered}} UNESCO World Heritage site hosting 1. 5 million <b>visitor-days</b> in 1994 / 95. Tourism is currently the main commercial use and is estimated to generate over $ 1 billion annually. [1] With the coming 2000 Olympics in Australia, tourism increases will substantially present a major conservation and preservation problem to the reef. This paper proposes {{a solution to this}} problem through establishing a virtual reality installation that is interactive and evolving, enabling many visitors to discover the reef through high quality immersive entertainment. This paper considers the technical implications required for a system based in Complexity: a distributed DOME and CAVE architectural system; a mixed reality environment; artificial life; multi-user interactivity; and hardware interfaces. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{two major}} {{recreational}} {{uses of the}} forest in southeastern Manitoba are outdoor recreation and hunting, with annual benefits of more than $ 6 million. Recreation accounted for almost $ 5. 5 million of the benefits, most of which came as income and employment to those providing food, accommodation, and other goods and services to tourists and recreationists. During the 1970 - 1975 period 819 394 <b>visitor-days</b> per year were forecast for the area, 94 % of them accounted for by outdoor recreation. Possible changes in forest management and fire control {{are not expected to}} alter significantly the total recreational benefits, although they might add or subtract benefits up to $ 30 000 per year on a long-term basis. In the case of a disastrous fire in the Whiteshe 11 Park annual loss of benefits might rise temporarily to $ 215 000. RESUME Dans 1 e sud-est du Manitoba, 1 a recreation en plein air et 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{documents the}} societal worth of riparian {{resources in the}} Southwestern United States. Two case studies are developed for this inquiry, the first being Aravaipa Canyon Wilderness in Southern Arizona, an area containing {{one of the last}} perennial streams in the Sonoran Desert bioregion. A hiking use value per <b>visitor-day</b> is estimated via the Travel Cost Method at $ 25. 06 and $ 17. 31 (2003 dollars) respectively for two access sites. I hypothesize the value discrepancy to indicate a premium for remote recreation. These valuation results compare well with other published recreational use value estimates, though it is the only valuation study associated with instream recreation in the Sonoran Desert of which I am aware. Indeed the environmental valuation literature is thin for the desert region in any respect. The second case study values public restoration preferences for the Albuquerque reach of the Rio Grande in Central New Mexico. A Choice Experiment and Contingent Valuation are employed within an original survey instrument to estimate human values for various restoration strategies planned for the region. Through focus groups and stakeholder interactions four restoration attributes were defined: vegetation density; tree type; fish and wildlife population; and natural river processes. Quantified values for Albuquerque area households were estimated for each restoration attribute level of change, allowing construction of total benefits anticipated for various restoration scenarios considered for the region. This research is at the vanguard of quantifying human benefit for saltcedar control, and this particular restoration characteristic was the most highly valued of all, at $ 59. 03 per household per year. Full restoration was valued at $ 156. 60 per household per year. These results have meaning beyond the study area since river restoration efforts are increasing across the Western US, with many focusing on controlling saltcedar, an exotic invasive plant. The final phase of this research integrates riparian valuation concepts within a dynamic simulation framework to guide systems-level riparian management. Control variables are combined with known valuation pathways to predict riparian investment funding optimal in benefit-cost ratio. The model is built for the Middle Rio Grande in Albuquerque, however it was designed for easy adaptation to other Southwestern riparian areas. A detailed forest module is included, through which seven defined forest stocks may be managed through thinning, clearing, and revegetation. River management may occur through environmental river flow releases, reconstructing stream-overbank connections, and wetland construction. Recreational amenities may be improved through the four infrastructure categories of trails, toilet facilities, picnic areas, and parking areas. Benefits and costs are estimated through original research and region benefit transfer, and tracked for different investment scenarios to predict the highest-return strategies over a 100 year planning horizon. A sensitivity analysis is used to suggest areas of future research...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{a description of}} previous planning documents for the Plan Area {{as well as a}} summary of system-wide and regional planning influences. 3. 1 Previous Plans When approved, the management direction and actions set forth in this Plan will replace those from a series of previous planning documents dating from 1962 to 1985. These documents are summarized as follows, and specific actions proposed in each document are described in Appendix A, Table A- 1. â€¢ Recreation Land Use and Acquisition Plan, San Luis Reservoir and Forebay (DWR, June 1962). In response to projected increases in recreational demands (to exceed 4 million <b>visitor-days</b> annually by 2020), the report recommended the acquisition of 13 recreation areas totaling 3, 308 acres, 768 acres of which would be specifically for recreation, and described potential uses for each area. The report also recommended the acquisition of a 300 -foot-wide strip of land bordering the entire perimeter of the reservoir and forebay to ensure unhindered use of the shoreline an...|$|R
50|$|Recreational {{use of the}} Musselshell averages 63,000 <b>visitor-days</b> per year. Much of {{the water}} on the Musselshell is decreed water and managed by the Musselshell River Distribution Project. The Musselshell is used {{extensively}} for irrigation for farming and ranching and due to that may run dry or nearly dry in many sections {{during much of the}} summer and fall. Water supply is less in the lower basin due to the more arid climate and the fact that users in the upper basin have senior rights to the water. Fishing is popular along most parts of the Musselshell. Species of fish found on the North and/or South Forks down to Harlowton include: mountain whitefish, and brown, cutthroat, rainbow, and brook trout. The eastern part of the river has channel catfish, sauger, smallmouth bass, and walleye due to the warmer water caused by dewatering from irrigation and the arid climate shift from mountain to prairie ecosystems in the Musselshell's last 90 mi. There are three different species of freshwater mussels as well as crawdads.|$|R
40|$|The {{parks and}} state forests that the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) manages deliver {{significant}} economic benefit to Connecticut residents and park visitors. In 2010, resident and nonresident visitors to Connecticutâ€™s 107 State Parks and 32 Forests spent 8. 5 million <b>visitor-days</b> touring within the state. Of those days, at least 4. 6 million days were spent partially at for-fee parks and forests managed by DEP. DEP activities generate the following {{direct and indirect}} economic impacts: 8. 8 thousand jobs currently, that {{in the absence of}} DEP managed parks and forests and activities would be reduced to 6. 7 thousand in 2020 as personnel found alternative employment; $ 343 million in personal income growing in current dollars to $ 595 million in 2020; $ 253 in personal disposable income, that generates choices for citizens, increasing to $ 471 million by 2020; and, Net present value in state revenues over expenditures of $ 30 million in constant dollars. In addition, owners of single residences in Connecticut derived amenity values of $ 270 million annually from overlooking DEP managed venues. If not preserved, alienation of any of that gree...|$|R
40|$|The {{extensive}} offshore {{coral reefs}} (patch, offshore bank or bank barrier, transitional and deep reefs), fringing mangroves, seagrass meadows, and hard-bottom areas, are protected as the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary; {{the third largest}} marine protected area in the USA. These resources are {{the basis for the}} economically important commercial fishing and tourism located in south Florida, which attracts more than 4 million visitors who spend in excess of 14 million <b>visitor-days</b> per year. Most are snorkelers and scuba divers, as well as recreational fishers and water sports enthusiasts. Others come to the Keys to relax and enjoy the tropical climate of a unique destination. The waters surrounding most of the 1700 islands of the Florida Reef Tract (here called the Florida Keys), which are arranged in a 320 km (220 mile) arc, were designated a national marine sanctuary in 1990 to stem mounting threats to the health and ecological future of the coral reef ecosystem. More than 60 % of the Sanctuary (9800 km; 2900 square nautical miles) is in State of Florida waters, and the Sanctuary is managed through a co-trustee managemen...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Heavy use {{of outdoor}} {{recreation}} {{areas in the}} United States since World War II is endangering their quality. Demand made by a rapidly growing population with rising personal incomes and increasing leisure time {{is expected to grow}} 50 percent nationally and 146 percent in Oregon by 1975. In Oregon, population, incomes, and amount of leisure time per person are all increasing more rapidly than nationally. A large influx of out-of-state visitors accelerates the demand. Eighty-five percent of outdoor recreation land in the United States and 95 percent in Oregon is owned by the Federal government. Recreation on Federal land is in general resource-based, that is, it depends upon some natural feature. The role of the Federal government is therefore pre-eminent in developing sites for resource-based recreation activities. Of the agencies involved in meeting the Federal responsibility, the possible role of the Fish and Wildlife Service is least known. Controlling approximately four percent of outdoor recreation land, the 300 refuges had only 13 million of the more than 500 million <b>visitor-days</b> to outdoor recreation areas in 1960. Recreation visits to refuges are increasing rapidly but apparently {{the quality and quantity of}} the remarkable wildlife resources of the National Wildlife Refuge System is little understood. As the mission of the Branch of Wildlife Refuges developed, its role involves the provision of habitat for every species of native wildlife somewhere in the System. The refuges are widely distributed over the nation, with the great majority, particularly those for migratory birds, concentrated in the four great flyways. The Service plans ultimately to include within refuge boundaries some 7. 5 million acres of the 12 million acres of wetlands needed to maintain present waterfowl populations. Recreation use compatible with wildlife management is permitted on the refuges but development of facilities has been slight. Although express authorization was obtained in 1962 for such development, no funds have since been provided. The Accelerated Public Works Program and the Job Corps Program both provide an avenue for development in some areas. The Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, located in southeastern Oregon, is an excellent example of the recreation potential in the Refuge System. One of the larger refuges, its duck and geese populations number over a million during spring and fall migration. Of Oregon's 425 bird species, 226 have been observed on the Refuge; 141 of them are listed as easily seen during one or more seasons of the year. Deer, antelope, and beaver are also easily seen. The Refuge lies in the basin of the two playas, Malheur and Harney Lakes, and extends for forty miles through the marshes of the Blitzen River toward Steens Mountain, an impressive fault block with alpine vegetation. An excellent museum exhibits indigenous species, photographs, nests, and food plants. A display pool provides an opportunity to observe birds at close hand. Besides wildlife observation and photography, Refuge recreation uses include fishing, water fowl hunting, and an exceptionally high quality annual all deer archery hunt. Camping and picnicking are commonly practiced in conjunction with other recreation activities. Recreation use of the Refuge is limited by inadequate facilities. Campsites are minimally developed and Refuge roads are impassable in wet weather. Authorization for the establishment of a Job Corps Camp on the Refuge in June of 1965 has been obtained and it is expected that Corps projects will serve to alleviate the deficiencies. Development of a significant recreation resource seems assured at a time of growing need...|$|R
