40|$|Despite {{significant}} {{interest in}} <b>value</b> <b>propositions,</b> {{there is limited}} agreement about their nature and role. Moreover, there is little understanding of their application to today’s increasingly interconnected and networked world. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore the nature of <b>value</b> <b>propositions,</b> extending prior conceptualisations by taking a service ecosystem perspective. Following a critical review of the extant literature in service science on <b>value</b> <b>propositions,</b> <b>value</b> co-creation, S-D logic and networks, and drawing on six metaphors that provide insights into the nature of <b>value</b> <b>propositions,</b> we develop a new conceptualisation. The role of <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> is then explored in terms of resource offerings between actors within micro, meso, and macro levels of service ecosystems. We illustrate these perspectives with two real world exemplars. We describe the role of <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> in an ecosystem as a shaper of resource offerings. Finally, we provide five key premises and outline a research agenda...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to examine the concept and {{functioning}} of <b>value</b> <b>propositions,</b> seen through a service-dominant logic (S-D) lens. The variety of perspectives used to understand <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> are examined, from unidirectional communication of value to reciprocal promises of value. The concept of reciprocal <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> is examined in the light of S-D logic's fundamental premises. Examples are included to show how reciprocal <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> can be used to initiate and guide resource integration activities between initiators and participants across a range of stakeholders of the firm. Some ‘taken for granted’ assumptions about market exchange are examined which act as a constraint on innovation in developing reciprocal <b>value</b> <b>propositions,</b> and more generally, stand in the way of innovative marketing practice. We also argue that reciprocal <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> reveal opportunities for focal firm engagement with suppliers, customers, and other beneficiaries beyond sale/purchase transactions, as part of a platform for communicative interaction. In summary, we position reciprocal <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> as a communication practice that brings exchange activities, relationship development, and knowledge renewal closer together...|$|R

Value based {{software}} engineering aims to incorporate economic aspects into {{the development of}} software. As a result, these economic aspects are very much integrated into the development life cycle of the software, as well as allowing different stakeholders (businesses, engineers, customers, business analyst, managers, and developers) to articulate their <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> into the software development life cycle. When incorporating different stakeholder <b>value</b> <b>propositions,</b> there arises the issue where these different <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> may conflict with each other because of different models {{that are used in}} coming up with these propositions. This project focuses on the stakeholder <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> at the requirements level of the software development life cycle. The requirements level of the Software Development life cycle (SDLC) is very important because everything else builds from it. Some of the reasons for project failures are attributed to poor requirements, so to ensure a successful software development, it is important to find conflicting <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> from stakeholders and resolve them. In this project, we first identify different conflicting requirements, and then detect various types of inconsistent requirements based on a set of algorithms. A tool is developed that works with requirement specifications and reports the conflicting stakeholder <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> in the value-based requirement engineering process.

40|$|Purpose – This article {{examines}} the notion of <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> (promises of﻿ reciprocal value between service providers and their customers), value-in-exchange and value-in-use, all within the conceptual context of service-dominant (S-D) logic. Design/methodology/approach – Responding to calls in the recent literature for an academic critique of S-D logic, its key constructs, and its application in marketing situations of varying complexity, the article presents a conceptual analysis of the determinants of value emphasis in <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> from the S-D perspective. Findings – Four guiding principles are derived from a rigorous analysis of the relevant literatures. Ways are discussed in which firms might achieve greater flexibility in designing their market offerings, and thus manage different customer segments using different <b>value</b> <b>propositions.</b> The general conclusion is {{that the ability to}} communicate a firm’s <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> strategically and effectively is a new area for the development of competence at the core of competitive advantage. Research implications – The findings pave the way for empirical research into the dynamics of <b>value</b> <b>propositions.</b> Since the main focus of the conceptual framework is on the customer-provider dyad, future studies should broaden coverage to multilateral settings and networked environments. Practical implications – Factors that determine the relative emphasis in <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> between value-in-exchange and value-in-use are discussed, and the management implications derived from each of the four principles identified. Originality/value – The article elaborates the application of S-D logic in marketing by investigating the determinants of relative emphasis of <b>value</b> <b>propositions.</b> Original Publication:Christian Kowalkowski, Dynamics of value propositions: insights from service-dominant logic, 2011, European Journal of Marketing, (45), 1 / 2, 277 - 294.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an eight-firm study, conducted from the service-dominant logic perspective, {{which makes a}} contribution regarding knowledge of the anatomy of <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> and service innovation. The paper suggests that <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> are configurations of several different practices and resources. The paper finds that ten common practices, organized in three main aggregates, constitute and fulfill value propositions: i. e. provision practices, representational practices, and management and organizational practices. Moreover, the paper suggests that service innovation can be equated {{with the creation of}} new <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> by means of developing existing or creating new practices and/or resources, or by means of integrating practices and resources in new ways. It identifies four types of service innovation (adaptation, resource-based innovation, practice-based innovation, and combinative innovation) and three types of service innovation processes (practice-based, resource-based, and combinative). The key managerial insight provided by the paper is that service innovation must be conducted and <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> must be evaluated {{from the perspective of the}} customers’ value creation, the service that the customer experiences. Successful service innovation is not only contingent on having the right resources, established methods and practices for integrating these resources into attractive <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> are also needed...|$|R

2500|$|Independent {{developer}} Vortex Media Arts {{was placed}} in charge of programming, art, animation, sound, script, and voice artists for the series. Meanwhile, as publisher, Creative Wonders {{was in charge of}} producing, testing, package design, documentation, online assistance, print activities, and consulting. Vortex Media Arts was formed by a 1993 merger of game design and programming technology company Strategic Visions (aka Creative Vision, founded in 1991), and art and animation company Lil' Gangster Entertainment, {{in order to create a}} stronger <b>value</b> <b>proposition</b> to publishers. Prior to the creation of Vortex Media Arts, Lil' Gangster Entertainment partner Jay Francis supervised the animated series of Madeline while working for DIC Entertainment as the shows' producer. Michael Pole was familiar with Lil' Gangster Entertainment through their work for Electronic Arts, as well as Virgin Interactive and Disney Interactive, but felt that while the company could take care of the animation work of Madeline, it was unable to produce an entire title in-house. After the merger however, Creative Wonders was able to obtain the Madeline licensing deal from DIC alongside the new company Vortex. Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show, the premiere project of the Madeline video game series, was created on a budget of $500,000 and required 60,000 units to be sold to break even. It cost Vortex $300,000 to produce later Madeline video games, and they were paid through an [...] "advances against royalties" [...] deal, receiving an [...] "advance of $3 on a disc that sells for $20 wholesale"; at least 100,000 copies of a video game had to be sold before Vortex received a royalty. The company saved money during development through an advance called [...] "publisher's assistance", which meant [...] "equipment is essentially borrowed from the publisher"; and the publisher then had the right to [...] "repurchase the equipment at a depreciated value after the project is completed." [...] Many Vortex artists had previously worked on the DIC television series, so had familiarity with the characters and design, and therefore had a lower learning curve. The video game series used an established engine that had already been created by Strategic Visions/Creative Vision, which minimised the technology learning curve. With the money that was saved from the relatively low rights acquisition fee, plus these [...] "business and design caveats", Creative Wonders was able to publish video games with high quality on-screen elements for a cost well below the standard of the industry. [...] Nevertheless, without outside financing, [...] "overhead, salaries, and marketing" [...] costs made royalty reimbursement from the games slim.|$|E
