5000|$|The paste is {{prepared}} by mixing powdered sugar with chautle, a <b>vegetable</b> <b>adhesive</b> and lemon. Egg whites are beaten separately then folded into the sugar. Vegetable dyes are added for color. The unworked portion {{is covered with}} a damp cloth to keep it from hardening. Molds are prepared by carefully cleaning them, then dusting them with flour so the sugar mixture does not stick. The sugar paste is flattened into thin circles which are pressed into the molds, then left to dry for 24 hours ...|$|E
50|$|Ancient repairs {{were made}} to damaged pottery using metal pins or staples, which could be made of copper, lead, or bronze. Animal or <b>vegetable</b> based <b>adhesives</b> may have also been used. Fragments from other vessels were {{sometimes}} used to replace damaged or missing sections of an object. The decorative elements on the replacement pieces {{may or may not}} have matched the rest of the vase.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} two volatile binding medias {{and their}} capacity to partially isolate distemper paint on wood during treatment with aqueous methods. The objective was to ascertain whether these methods were applicable {{in the context of}} the thesis and, if so, to determine whether a practical method, primarily suited to in situ conservation, could be identified. In order to assess the capacities and limitations of the respective substances, initial experiments were undertaken on test surfaces with distemper paint. Paints were prepared with both animal- and <b>vegetable</b> <b>adhesives,</b> respectively, in which the PVC was also adjusted. These measures ensured that the test materials where characterised by conditions also found among authentic materials. The isolating capacity of the substances was evaluated, in conjunction with aqueous treatment with both natural and synthetic adhesives, using various application forms and -methods for the respective isolators. Comparative ocular and microscopic assessments of changes in the distemper paint’s visual appearance were also executed. These evaluations indicated that several methods may be applicable, although in differing contexts. Based on the objective of the thesis, the most relevant method was selected for use in the case study. The authentic material used in the study consisted of selected material from three ceilings with decorative paintings made in the 1700 s, included in Jönköping Museum’s collection. A saturated solution of menthol in petroleum spirit (4 : 5) was brushed on to a limited area in the centre of the distemper paint layer. The surface could, subsequently, be treated with a gelatine solution (2. 5 %), without restriction, through the partially insulating film. This process did not risk any discolouration in the transition between the treated and untreated surface. Approximately one month after the application, at which point a complete sublimation could be assumed, further findings regarding the surfaces were again documented – both those utilised in the initial experiments and those utilised in the case study. An ocular inspection of the test material yielded very good results, while the authentic material gave a somewhat “milky” impression. However, upon microscopic inspection, traces of menthol were visible in all cases, to varying degrees.

40|$|Driven by the {{industrial}} application {{needs and the}} desire to improve sustainability, my studies have focused on developing vegetable oil-based wax and binder alternatives to replace petroleum-based wax and animal product-based bird seed binder, and to improve the availability of natural waxes having desired properties but limited availability. A variety of soybean oil-based wax ester and amide derivatives were synthesized as potential paraffin and carnauba wax replacers, and a <b>vegetable</b> oil-based <b>adhesive</b> material was developed {{as an alternative to the}} gelatin-based bird seed binder. Some of the compounds showed physical properties such as hardness, cohesiveness and melting point, very comparable to paraffin and carnauba wax. The soybean oil-based binder was promising in providing seed cakes with good strength under different environmental conditions. The structure-function relationships of vegetable oil-based waxes were investigated and established. A work focusing on developing an environmental friendly solvent extraction system for the recovery of poly-β- hydroxybutyrate (PHB), a high-value biopolymer, was also included. The novel and solvent system was proven to be effective for extracting PHB from bacterial cells...|$|R
