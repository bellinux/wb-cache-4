50|$|VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>range,</b> or VOR, is an {{implementation}} of the reverse-RDF system, but one that is more accurate and able to be completely automated.|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{navigational aids}} that GRU traffic uses. The Bonsucesso very high {{frequency}} <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>range</b> with distance measuring equipment (VOR-DME) is located [...] {{to the east of}} GRU.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lack of a}} VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>range</b> (VOR) beacon at {{the airport}} poses an issue, as few {{aircraft}} have appropriate GPS systems to enable non-precision instrument approaches in bad weather.|$|R
50|$|Good pilots use {{all means}} {{available}} to help navigate. Many GA aircraft are fitted {{with a variety of}} navigation aids, such as Automatic direction finder (ADF), inertial navigation, compasses, radar navigation, VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>range</b> (VOR) and GNSS.|$|R
50|$|A modern Doppler Weather radar with a 150 mi. {{range was}} built by the DAO in 2005. Navaids at the airport, such as the Instrument Landing System (ILS) and VOR (VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>range),</b> are owned by the DAO but {{maintained}} by BAS-Serco.|$|R
50|$|On {{the north}} side of the runway, there is airport {{facilities}} owned by PT Dirgantara Indonesia. Moreover, the airport is also equipped with PAPI (Precision Approach Path Indicator) and VOR (VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>range),</b> devices that help planes to land at night and other navigation tools.|$|R
50|$|At the time, aircrew {{fixed the}} {{position}} of their aircraft as being above Mont Blanc by taking a cross-bearing from one VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>range</b> (VOR) as they flew along a track from another VOR.

50|$|At 23:34 {{the flight}} had descended to 5,500 feet and {{captured}} the 226 degree radial of the Pago Pago VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>range</b> (VOR) and were flying the reciprocal heading of 46 degrees. Pago Pago Approach Control reported winds zero one zero degrees at one five gusting two zero.|$|R
50|$|During {{the course}} of the investigation, {{investigators}} revealed that there was a possible failure mode of the very high frequency <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>range</b> (VOR)/ILS system. This failure mode could have led the flight crew into believing that they were on course and on the glidepath when they were not.|$|R
50|$|On June 19, 2010, {{important}} {{navigation equipment}} at the Manila airport maintained by CAAP failed. The VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>range</b> (VOR) used by aircraft for navigating {{to and from}} the airport stopped working due to heavy rain and there was no available replacement. One had to be brought from another airport.|$|R
50|$|The airport has full Instrument Landing System (ILS) and VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>range</b> (VOR) {{located on}} the airport.

50|$|Distance {{measuring}} equipment (DME) in 1948 and VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>range</b> (VOR) stations became the main route navigation means during the 1960s, superseding the low frequency radio ranges and the non-directional beacon (NDB): the ground based VOR stations were often co-located with DME transmitters and the pilots could establish their bearing and {{distance to the}} station.|$|R
50|$|In the United States and Canada, Victor airways are low-altitude airways. They {{are defined}} in {{straight}}-line segments, {{each of which}} is based on a straight line between either two VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>range</b> (VOR) stations, or a VOR and a VOR intersection, hence the beginning letter V (pronounced as Victor, in the ICAO phonetic alphabet).|$|R
50|$|Rekken is a {{small village}} in the Dutch {{municipality}} of Berkelland. It lies in the most northeast corner of the province Gelderland, {{about half a mile}} from the German border. The river Berkel enters The Netherlands east of Rekken. Rekken is also known in international aviation, by the VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>range</b> called 'Rekken' (RKN).|$|R
5000|$|Non-precision {{instrument}} runways {{are often}} used at small- to medium-size airports. These runways, depending on the surface, may be marked with threshold markings, designators, centerlines, and sometimes a 1000 ft mark (known as an aiming point, sometimes installed at 1500 ft). They provide horizontal position guidance to planes on instrument approach via Non-directional beacon, VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>range,</b> Global Positioning System, etc.|$|R

50|$|To {{meet these}} {{requirements}} the report recommended installation of {{airport surveillance radar}} and installation of VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>range</b> (VOR)/distance measuring equipment (DME) on aircraft. In addition the report made several other recommendations such as installing transponders to aircraft to provide altitude and identification information to ground-based radar and to install precision approach radar to improve the capability of aircraft to land in poor weather conditions.|$|R
5000|$|VOR/DME {{refers to}} {{combined}} radio navigation station for aircraft, {{which consists of}} two radio beacons, placed together, a VHF <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>range</b> (VOR) and distance measuring equipment (DME). VOR produces an angle between the station and the receiver in the aircraft, while DME does the same for range. Together, they provide the two measurements needed to produce a navigational [...] "fix" [...] using a chart.|$|R

5|$|The Australian Hornets {{were very}} similar to the {{standard}} USNavy variants, but incorporated a number of minor modifications. These included the addition of an Instrument Landing System/Very High Frequency <b>Omnidirectional</b> <b>Range</b> (ILS/VOR) system, a high-frequency radio, a different ejection seat harness and the deletion of all equipment used only to launch the aircraft from catapults. In addition, two of the Australian aircraft were fitted with flight-test instrumentation so that they could be used as part of trials.|$|R
