40|$|Abstract—A comb-actuated {{torsional}} microscanner is devel-oped for high-resolution laser-scanning display systems. Typical torsional comb-drive scanners have fingers placed {{around the}} perimeter of the scanning mirror. In contrast, the structure in this paper uses cascaded frames, where the comb fingers are placed on an outer drive frame, and the motion is transferred to the inner mirror frame with a mechanical gain. The structure works only in resonant mode without requiring any offset in the comb fingers, keeping the silicon-on-insulator-based process quite simple. The design intent is to improve actuator efficiency by removing the high-drag fingers from the high-velocity scanning mirror. Placing them on the lower <b>velocity</b> <b>drive</b> frame reduces their contribution to the damping torque. Furthermore, placement on the drive frame allows an increase of the number of fingers and their capacity to impart torque. The microscanner exhibits a parametric response, and as such, the maximum deflection is found when actuated at twice its natural frequency. Analytical formulas are given for the coupled-mode equations and frame deflections. A simple formula is derived for the mechanical-gain factor. For a 1 -mm × 1. 5 -mm oblong scanning mirror, a 76 ◦ total optical scan angle is achieved at 21. 8 kHz with 196 -V peak-to-peak excitation voltages.

Based on a 1 / 5 scale semi-span aeroelastic wind tunnel model of a generic tiltrotor concept, a numerical simulation is set up using a general purpose multibody simulation tool. The model possesses a gimballed stiff-in-plane rotor with a constant <b>velocity</b> <b>drive</b> system. Three different control algorithms are presented and evaluated. Firstly, there is a single-input single-output controller using conditioned wing deflection feedback on longitudinal cyclic swashplate input. Secondly, two types of multi-input multi-output control {{that are based on}} time domain identification of the model are presented: A Linear Quadratic Regulator with a Kalman-Bucy state estimator and a Generalized Predictive Control algorithm. Both of them use measured wing deflections in order to calculate appropriate swashplate input. The control studies are done with a windmilling rotor. Detailed results of the closed-loop behavior of three wing and two gimbal natural modes are presented up to the closed-loop stability boundaries. Robustness analyses of the algorithms with respect to wing natural frequencies, structural damping, flight speed, rotation speed, flight altitude and signal noise {{are an integral part of}} the article. The rotor shear force is shown in the open-loop condition and in presence of a controller in order to illustrate the whirl flutter mechanism and the action of the controller.

40|$|Water {{and soil}} {{essential}} resources for human lives. For rational management {{and use of}} resources, {{it is necessary to}} understand hydraulic and physical properties and characteristics of water flow. Observations of the surface sheet erosion on hill slopes during heavy raining reveal that both thesand and silt are moved by runoff. Through hydraulic sorting the bigger sand stay on the riverbed; and the smaller will flow down. Sediment is transportedby water. Understanding the interaction of flow fluid and sediment is useful to sediment control; watershed conservation works and disaster reduction and minimization. This study investigates how fluid to flow. All physical parameters are analyzed. Reasonable theoretical models are built. For finding the Aspects of fluid flow and sediment transport, to usable to derive or probability events like molecular collision, thermal radiation are rated with experiment data, measured or obtainted from literature. Chapter 2 discuses the smallest unit of flow mechanics-water molecule. Three spatial scales (Vs,As,Ls) are used to the structure of dynamic fluid,force field and property behaviors. In chapter 3 three spatial scales and lennard-jones potential energy function drive dimensionless inner energy U*, through the U* and Reynold number, Mach number and spatial scale which are utilized to derive relationship for further understanding molecular (van der Waals and Born) force; flow field; fluid phase. Relations between molecular movement and temperature are analyzed. Comparison by classical gases kinetic theory led toa new function equation (P+ a/V^ 3 -c/V^ 5) (V-b) =kS*T. By entropy and statistic mechanics options suggests that molecular collision caused change of thermal radiation wave. Chapter 4 deal with macroscopic flow fluid state, fluid behaviors and movement from gravity field integrates macroscopic and microscopic flow fluid. It builds relationship between the unit mass of velocity, stress (momentum) and energy and promotes mixing theory to describe turbulence; boundary layer and up lift force. Velocity profile, flow fluid structure and von Karman constants are also discussed. In chapter 5 the Yang Chih Ted unit stream power theory, analysis sedimentmovement and incipient flow on the steep river are used to discuss three parameters ψ 1,ψ 2,ψ 3. It is able to transfore each parameter through function of theory which can save much time on experiment. The setting <b>velocity</b> <b>drive</b> from Stoke''s law is fitted with a limit physical range. From enlarging the physical use range by Newton law a new equation(5. 37) form is derived. It is a better equation than original and USBR empirical equation. In Chapter 6 sediment yield of the Tsengwen watershed is used to test and assess the theoretical relations derived. A regression equation between incipient diameter and discharge was derived. It is indicated that sediment data can be useful in estimating the peak flood discharge. This study forcuses on flow mechanics. However the physics of water and inter- science with quantum mechanics, statistic mechanics, thermodynamics, acoustic and sediment mechanics are discussed. Many new viewpoints are found to renew milecular movement and flow fliud model. It is prove that water in the inertial force is incompressible. The density will change with flow fluid movement. The turbulence occurrence process is influenced by molecular force and potential, mixing movement major support to up lift suspension load.

Shattering is assumed to take place if the relative velocity between a pair of grains is larger than the shattering threshold velocities, vshathat (2.7 and 1.2 km s− 1 for silicate and graphite, respectively; Jones et al., 1996).

When opposite magnetic helicities of equal magnitude are injected on the intermediate and small scales, the large scale magnetic helicity grows kinematically (independent of the magnetic Reynolds number) to equal that on the intermediate scale. For both free and driven relaxation large scale fields are rapidly produced. Subsequently, a dissipation-limited dynamo, driven by growth of small scale kinetic helicity, further amplifies the large scale field. The results are important for astrophysical coronae fed with bihelical structures by dynamos in their host rotators. The large scale for the rotator corresponds to the intermediate scale for the corona. That bihelical magnetic relaxation can produce global scale fields may help to explain the formation of astrophysical coronal holes and magnetohydrodynamic outflows.

The importance of this effect is determined by the ratio of the cylinder radii and the distance between the cylinders, and it is shown that when this ratio is small, multipactor can only occur for surfaces having very large secondary emission coefficients.

40|$|A {{regional}} coupled {{model is}} used for a dynamic downscaling over the tropical Atlantic based on a global warming simulation carried out with the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory CM 2. 1. The regional coupled model features a realistic representation of equatorial ocean dynamical processes such as the Tropical Instability Waves (TIWs) that are not adequately simulated in many global coupled climate models. The coupled downscaling hence provides {{a unique opportunity to}} assess their response and impact in a changing climate. Under global warming, both global and regional models exhibit an increased (decreased) rainfall in the tropical Northeast (South) Atlantic. Given this asymmetric change in mean state, the regional model produces the intensified near-surface cross-equatorial southerly wind and zonal currents. The equatorial cold tongue exhibits a reduced surface warming due to the enhanced upwelling. It is mainly associated with the increased vertical <b>velocities</b> <b>driven</b> by cross-equatorial wind, in contrast to the equatorial Pacific, where thermal stratification is suggested to be more important under global warming.

Under adequate conditions, the process is stationary and geometrically-mixing. In this context, we propose an adaptive non-parametric kernel estimator of the stationary density p of Z, based on n discrete time observations with time step. Two observation schemes are considered: in the first one, Z is the observed process, in the second one, only X is measured. Estimators are proposed in both settings and upper risk bounds of the mean integrated squared error (MISE) are proved and discussed in each case, the second one being more difficult than the first one. We propose a data driven bandwidth selection procedure based on the Goldenshluger and Lespki (2011) method. In both cases of complete and partial observations, we can prove a bound on the MISE asserting the adaptivity of the estimator. In practice, we take advantage of a very recent improvement of the Goldenshluger and Lespki (2011) method provided by Lacour et al. (2016), which is computationally efficient and easy to calibrate. We obtain convincing simulation results in both observation contexts...|$|R
