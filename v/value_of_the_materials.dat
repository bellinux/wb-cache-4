2500|$|As {{in later}} periods objects {{carved in the}} round from semi-precious stone were {{regarded}} as a similar category of object; these are also known as hardstone carvings. [...] One of the largest, the Coupe des Ptolémées was probably donated to the Basilica of Saint-Denis, near Paris, by Charles the Bald, as the inscription on its former gem-studded gold Carolingian mounting stated; it may have belonged to Charlemagne. [...] One of the best collections of such vessels, though mostly plain without carved decoration, was looted from Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade, {{and is in the}} Treasury of the Basilica of San Marco in Venice. [...] Many of these retain the medieval mounts which adapted them for liturgical use. [...] Like the Coupe des [...] Ptolémées, most objects in European museums lost these when they became objects of classicist interest from the Renaissance onwards, or when the mounts were removed for the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>materials,</b> as happened to many in the French Revolution.|$|E

That chivalry might not be omitted amid this splendour, a silver Saint George was presented, mounted and equipped in the usual fashion in which he bestrides the dragon.
