40|$|Accomplishing the best-performing {{composite}} matrix (resin) {{requires that}} not only the processing method but also the cure cycle generate low-void-content structures. If voids are present, {{the performance of the}} composite matrix will be significantly reduced. This is usually noticed by significant reductions in matrix-dominated properties, such as compression and shear strength. Voids in composite materials are areas that are absent of the composite components: matrix and fibers. The characteristics of the voids and their accurate estimation are critical to determine for high performance composite structures. One widely used method of performing void analysis on a composite structure sample is acquiring optical micrographs or Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images of lateral sides of the sample and retrieving the <b>void</b> <b>areas</b> within the micrographs/images using an image analysis technique. Segmentation for the retrieval and subsequent computation of <b>void</b> <b>areas</b> within the micrographs/images is challenging as the gray-scaled values of the <b>void</b> <b>areas</b> are close to the gray-scaled values of the matrix leading to the need of manually performing the segmentation based on the histogram of the micrographs/images to retrieve the <b>void</b> <b>areas.</b> The use of an algorithm developed by NASA and based on Fuzzy Reasoning (FR) proved to overcome the difficulty of suitably differentiate void and matrix image areas with similar gray-scaled values leading not only to a more accurate estimation of <b>void</b> <b>areas</b> on composite matrix micrographs but also to a faster void analysis process as the algorithm is fully autonomous...|$|R

Being at once a simple bilateral quadripoint and a far more complicated intersection of claim limits (an elevenfold 6-country point), the South Pole example combines two parcels of virgin unclaimed land with two parcels of Antarctic Treaty regulated territory (which have been variously claimed, disputed, recognized, ignored, disowned, reclaimed, etc., as national sovereign territory by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, Great Britain, and New Zealand, if not also Norway).

Fibroblasts from the two sites were firstly grown to confluence and then an area of cells removed (cell <b>void</b> <b>area).</b> Cell migration alone (with the addition of the mitosis inhibitor mitomycin-C to the culture media) and proliferation and migration combined (without mitomycin-C) into the cell <b>void</b> <b>area</b> were observed at 0, 5, 10, 24 and 36 h. The presence of mitomycin-C in the culture media significantly slowed the closure of the cell <b>void</b> <b>area,</b> as mitosis was inhibited. For the oral cells only, TGF? 1 significantly slowed both migration (with mitomycin-C) and proliferation and migration combined (without mitomycin-C).

For both cell types, EGF significantly reduced migration (with mitomycin-C). IGF- 1 had no effect on any of the parameters measured.

The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{optimize}} the bonding parameters to develop an adhesive wafer bonding process that produces a defect free and relatively strong bond using SU- 8 as an intermediate adhesive layer at the lowest possible processing temperature. There {{are a variety of}} bonding parameters that {{have a significant impact on}} void formation at the bond interface, defect density and the bond strength. The influence of several bonding parameters on the resulting bond quality was studied to identify the Key Process Input Variables of soft bake temperature, UV exposure dose and bonding temperature. Three different values were chosen for each process variable and the bonding process was repeated in random order for all possible combinations of process variables. The quality of a wafer bond is determined by the fraction of interfacial area in intimate contact and the strength of the bond interaction. Therefore, the <b>void</b> <b>area</b> and fracture strength of each bonded sample was considered as Key Process Output Variables. Bond characterization, which involves bond interface imaging to detect defects and measure <b>void</b> <b>area,</b> and tensile load testing to calculate the fracture strength, was done on all the bonded wafer pairs. All the bonded wafers were scanned using a Sonoscan Scanning Acoustic Microscope (SAM) and C-Scan images were used to determine <b>void</b> <b>area.</b> The six inch bonded wafers were diced into 5 mm X 5 mm size test specimens and each was scanned using SAM to calculate the interface bond area.

The Raman efficiency of SiC is sufficiently high because of the strong covalent bonds in the material.

Raman spectra were registered in a backscattering geometry using a RENISHAW 1000 micro-Raman system equipped with a CCD camera and a Leica microscope. Two types of measurements were performed: single-spot measurements from both a <b>void</b> <b>area</b> and outside the <b>void</b> <b>area</b> in the SiC layers, and line-mapping measurements conducted along the voids with nanoscale depth profile of the void varied from 30 nm up to 2000 nm (at the centre of void).

Line mapping was performed at a distance, x, ranging from 0 to 13 μm with an in-plane step size of 300 nm, where zero corresponds to the starting point of the measurements. Laser radiation was focused onto the sample using a 100 × microscope objective with a short-focus working distance, providing a spot size of ~ 600 nm.
