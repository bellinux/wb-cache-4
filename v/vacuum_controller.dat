40|$|A {{microscopic}} method {{was developed to}} detect pressure thresholds for gas outflow and solution impregnation during vacuum impregnation of plant materials. Raw materials with different porosities (apple and spinach) were impregnated with an isotonic sucrose solution at a minimum pressure of 150 mbar. An automatic <b>vacuum</b> <b>controller</b> system (AVCS) was used to control the pressure during vacuum impregnation. Micrographs of tissues subjected to vacuum impregnation were recorded as the pressure in the treatment chamber was varied. Image analysis allowed {{the evaluation of the}} pressure at which gas was released from the pores (seen as bubbles) during the application of vacuum, and the pressure at which tissue impregnation took place during the restoration of atmospheric pressure. Spinach tissues showed gas release at a much lower pressure than apple, and impregnation commenced at a much higher pressure. These differences in pressure threshold could be caused by the narrow pores in spinach and possibly by changes in leaf volume. Industrial relevance: Vacuum impregnation is considered a promising technology to facilitate the impregnation of vegetable tissues with different solutions containing, e. g., firming, antioxidant or antimicrobial agents. The mass transfer taking place during vacuum impregnation depends on the characteristics of the tissue pores. Effective vacuum impregnation requires the efficient removal of air from the tissue during vacuum treatment to obtain complete filling of the tissue during the subsequent impregnation step. The findings of this study may allow food manufacturers to optimize vacuum impregnation parameters depending on the porosity characteristics of the raw material. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|NA 62 is a {{fixed target}} {{experiment}} to measure very rare decays of Kaons at CERN Super Proton Synchrotron accelerator. The NA 62 experiment line comprises several large detectors installed inside a vacuum vessel with {{a length of}} 250 m and an internal diameter of up to 2. 8 m. The vacuum installation consists of 170 remote controlled pumps, valves and gauges. The operational specifications of NA 62 require a complex vacuum control system: tight interaction between <b>vacuum</b> <b>controllers</b> and detector controllers, including pumping or venting vetoes, and detector start-stop interlocks; most of the valves are interlocked, including the large vacuum sector gate valves; the vacuum devices are driven by 20 logic processes. The vacuum control system is based on commercial Programmable Logical Controllers (Siemens PLC: S 7 - 300 series) and a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition application (Siemens SCADA: WINCC OA).

Multi-loop control of the process is demons trated, whereby the massecuite Brix is controlled by manipulating the liquor/A molasse s feed rate to the pan and the mother molasses Brix is controlled by manipulating the steam flow rate to the pan. A single loop controller is also proposed, which cont rols massecuite Brix by manipulating the feed flow to the pan. The steam flow rate is set manually (i. e. mother molasses Brix is uncontrolled).
