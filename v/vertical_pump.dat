40|$|Abstract: Vertical pumps have {{intrinsically}} weak {{structures for}} vibration resonance {{because of their}} long slender shapes. Therefore, {{it is important to}} estimate the vibration characteristics of a <b>vertical</b> <b>pump</b> analytically and/or experimentally before its final installation. Sometimes, however, unexpected resonances arise after the installation. The unexpected resonance is found to be due to the difference between the boundary condition of a <b>vertical</b> <b>pump</b> for rigid-foundation test operation and for flexible-foundation real operation. In order to examine this problem and quantify the effect of the foundation condition on the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the entire pump assembly, amathematical model using a Euler–Bernoulli beam with a flexible foundation is presented. This model combines the lower and upper parts of a ver-tical pump, distinguishing it from previous analytical models. Experiments and simulations have been performed to validate this mathematical model and to evaluate the effect of foun-dation stiffness on vibration behaviour. Parametric studies have also been carried out to inves-tigate the effects of other design variables on the dynamic characteristics of the pumps and to propose design strategies for improvement in the dynamics...|$|E

40|$|This work {{addresses}} the general {{topic of the}} gas entrainment from a free surface by a swirl issued from the pumping of fluids below the free surface.

One particularity of these experiments is the possibility to change the shape of the channel generating the inlet conditions by adding obstacles so as to trigger different conditions for the turbulent shear flow.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate and enhance dynamic performance for a vertical pumping unit. The original electric motor of the pump unit had been replaced by another one different in design and weights. Vibration has been increased greatly after installing the new motor. Consequently, it is necessary to estimate the change in the vibration characteristics owing to the difference in the boundary conditions of the new motor. Measured vibration levels and frequency analysis were dangerous at 1 × due to resonance problem. Finite Element Analysis was used to model the motor structure in order to find its natural frequencies and mode shapes. The results confirm that the third natural frequency is very close to 1 × operating speed with deviation about 1 %. To solve the resonance problem, it was recommended to increase the structure stiffness. The results after modifications confirmed that the overall vibration level decreases by 89 %.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} whether an in-line filter {{inserted in the}} syringe pump infusion line assembly influences start-up times and flow irregularities during <b>vertical</b> <b>pump</b> displacement at low infusion rates. METHODS: Fluid delivery after syringe pump start-up and after vertical displacement of the syringe pump by - 50 cm was determined gravimetrically at flow rates of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 ml h(- 1). Measurements were repeated for each flow rate four times with two different syringe pumps with and without an in-line filter incorporated. Data are shown as median and range. RESULTS: Start-up times were reduced by an in-line filter at 0. 5 ml h(- 1) flow rate from 355. 5 s (0 - 660) to 115 s (0 - 320), whereas the effect was attenuated at higher flow rates. Pooling of fluid into the infusion system after lowering the infusion syringe pump was halved in all flow rates tested. Amount of infusion bolus after elevating the syringe pump by 50 cm was not affected by an in-line filter. CONCLUSION: In the evaluated model in-line filters help to reduce flow irregularities and delay in drug delivery of syringe pumps at low flow rates and represent an option to optimize continuous administration of highly concentrated short-acting drugs at very small infusion rates...|$|E
40|$|Impact of the {{small-scale}} elongated filaments on the oceanic <b>vertical</b> <b>pump</b> by Guillaume Lapeyre 1 and Patrice Klein 2 Oceanic mesoscale eddies (with {{a diameter}} of 50 – 100 km) {{are known to be}} associated with significant vertical tracer fluxes in the upper few hundred meters. In particular, they are important for the biogeochemical system, accounting for 20 – 30 % of the vertical nutrient transport. However, estimates of the global tracer fluxes neglect the role played by thin elongated filaments (with a width of 5 – 10 km). These sub-mesoscale structures are produced by eddy interactions and ubiquitous in regions between eddies. We use a Surface Quasi-Geostrophic model to quantify their impact on the net vertical tracer flux into the surface layers. We show that eddy interactions are an important source of tracer injection because they lead to the production of filaments and to large vertical velocities within these structures. This is attributed to the frontogenetic dynamics induced by the horizontal stirring processes. When taking into account this process for the global statistics of tracer injection, the tracer flux associated with the filaments is as significant as that associated with the eddies. This outcome points out the necessity to explicitly include the filamentation process in global ocean model studies. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper aims at {{studying}} numerically {{the competition}} between two mutually exclusive phytoplankton species in a fully-turbulent field consisting of interacting mesoscale and submesoscale structures. A simple NPPZD ecosystem model is embedded in a Surface Quasi-Geostrophic model which is able to reproduce frontogenesis and the associated nutrient <b>vertical</b> <b>pump.</b> The two simulated phytoplankton species differ by their size and their affinity for nutrients. In this study, we rationalize {{the role played by}} eddies and filaments in the distribution of the two phytoplankton species. We show that the SQG dynamics are responsible for the coexistence of the two phytoplankton species on a single limiting resource at statistical steady state. In addition, we show {{that as a result of}} strong vertical injections, filaments contain 64 % of the phytoplankton biomass. The two phytoplankton species coexist in filaments but the large phytoplankton is predominant. By contrast, this latter is completely excluded from eddy cores where only the small phytoplankton develops. Since eddies are coherent structures (unlike filaments) and since their edges are almost impermeable to horizontal transport, the large phytoplankton can barely enter eddies. Therefore, eddies are ecological niches which shelter the small phytoplankton. Finally we show that interactions between eddies such as eddy merger can favor the survival of phytoplankton species within eddies on long time scales in the ocean...|$|E

Unfortunately, when such pumps employ plain cylindrical journal bearings, they tend to suffer from rotordynamic instability problems due to the inherent lightly-loaded condition that the vertical orientation places on the bearings. This paper describes {{a case study in}} which the authors utilized rotordynamic analysis and experimental vibration analysis to diagnose such a problem and designed replacement tilting-pad bearings to solve the problem. The subject pumps are 45 foot long <b>vertical</b> <b>pumps</b> used for mixing nuclear waste in one million gallon tanks. Each pumping system consists of an induction motor driven by a variable frequency drive, a segmented pump shaft with a centrifugal impeller at the bottom, and a pipe column that surrounds the pump shaft and is suspended into the tank. The column is filled with water that serves as the lubricant for the eight plain cylindrical journal bearings that support the pump shaft. Unfortunately, these pumps have been plagued with vibration related problems, such as bearing and seal failures, ever since they were commissioned. In order to evaluate the problem, the pump shaft and column were instrumented with vibration transducers, and vibration testing was performed. This testing revealed that subsynchronous whirling, at approximately one-half the running speed, was the primary culprit responsible for the failures. In an effort to understand the cause of the observed vibrations, a two-level rotordynamic model of the pump shafting and column was constructed. This rotordynamic model, like those for many <b>vertical</b> <b>pumps,</b> was far from routine. The rotordynamic analysis, which is described in detail, then successfully confirmed that the problem was subsynchronous whirling due to rotordynamic instability. This analysis was then used to guide the design of tilting-pad bearings employing offset pivots and geometric preload to replace the original plain cylindrical bearings and, thereby, resolve the instability problem. The plain cylindrical bearings were removed from a pump, tilting-pad bearings were installed, and subsequent testing verified the predicted vibration reduction. Accordingly, the application of tilting-pad bearings, whose design is described in detail, was conclusively shown to be an effective solution for this specific problem...|$|R
