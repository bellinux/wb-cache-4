5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was <b>vital</b> <b>to</b> the state's economic interests.

Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E

For Edward this was therefore {{a good opportunity to}} assert the royal prerogative, and to demonstrate that it extended also into the Marches of Wales.|$|E
