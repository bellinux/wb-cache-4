40|$|Today’s {{spark-ignition}} engine works {{more and more}} on knocking limit because of higher requirements on consumption, exhaust-gas limits and engine power. Heavy knocking can damage the engine permanently. Therefore it is necessary to prevent knocking. The knock sensor signal consists of many components. A knocking combustion creates one component in the knock sensor signal. But the signal contains also disturbing noise by normal combustion and mechanical vibration of other engine components. This disturbing noise can influence the knock detection. A false detected knocking doesn’t damage the engine, but decreases the performance. The influence of the components piston and <b>valve</b> on the <b>knock</b> detection is analysed in this paper. A possibility to calibrate the knock detection with time-frequency analysis is presented. On this way, the influences of the disturbing noise of the components on the knock detection are mitigated. Key words disturbance in knock detection, influence of piston and <b>valve</b> on <b>knock</b> detection, time-frequency analysis, Wigner-Ville distribution State of the art To detect a knocking combustion the knock sensor signal is analysed by band-pass filtering and integration. The parameters of the filter and the integrator are optimized by the correlation coefficient between the characteristic value for knocking intensity of the pressure signal and the acceleration signal. Disturbances off several engine components can influence the knock detection, i. e. valve. In this paper, the influences of different components of the engine on the knock detection are analysed. With the information of the influences the parameters of the knock detection can be modifie...|$|R
2500|$|In 1991, a Chrysler MPI fuel {{injection}} system replaced the RENIX system, and the intake ports were raised approximately [...] for a better entry radius. Chrysler also enlarged the throttle body and redesigned the intake and exhaust manifolds for more efficiency, and the fuel injectors were replaced with higher flow units. Camshaft timing was also changed. The net result was an engine that made [...] and [...] Badging on most Jeeps equipped with this engine read [...] "4.0 Litre HIGH OUTPUT." [...] The new cam profile combined with altered computer programming eliminated {{the need for an}} EGR <b>valve</b> and <b>knock</b> sensor, but made the engine more sensitive to alterations, especially where emissions are concerned. The OEM fuel injectors used with the Mopar MPI system (manufactured by Siemens) have been known to leak fuel especially with OBDII where plugged catalytic converters are common which usually throws a P0420 code.|$|R
5000|$|A {{technique}} {{used to prevent}} the onset of knock is the high [...] "swirl" [...] engine that forces the intake charge to adopt a fast circular rotation in the cylinder during compression that provides quicker and more complete combustion. It is possible to manufacture gasoline engines with compression ratios of over 11:1 that can use 87 (MON + RON)/2 (octane rating) fuel {{with the addition of}} variable <b>valve</b> timing and <b>knock</b> sensors to delay ignition timing. Such engines may not produce their full rated power using 87 octane gasoline under all circumstances, due to the delayed ignition timing. Direct fuel injection, which can inject fuel only at the time of fuel ignition (similar to a diesel engine), is another recent development which also allows for higher compression ratios on gasoline engines.|$|R
40|$|International audienceHighly boosted spark {{ignition}} (SI) engines {{are more and}} more attractive for car manufacturers in terms of efficiency and CO 2 emissions. However, thermodynamic conditions encountered in these engines promote the occurrence of abnormal combustions like knock or super-knock, which are experimentally difficult to analyse due to the risks of engine damages. The Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) method mainly used in industry for piston engines is not the most appropriate as knock does not always affect the mean cyclecaptured by RANS. Using an accurate LES compressible code and improved versions of ECFM-LES (Extended Coherent Flame Model) and TKI (Tabulated Kinetics of Ignition) models allowing a full uncoupling of flame propagation and auto-ignition reaction rates, this work demonstrates {{for the first time that}} LES is able to describe quantitatively knocking combustion in a realistic SI engine configuration. Contrary to previous studies (Fontanesi et al., 2013 [5]) (Lecocq et al., 2011 [4]), a quantified knock analysis is conducted based on a specific post-processing of both numerical and experimental data. LES is able to predict the in-cylinder pressure variability, the knock occurrence frequency and the mean knock onset crank angle for several spark timings. A 3 D analysis also demonstrates that knock occurs at random locations, mainly at the exhaust <b>valves</b> side. <b>Knock</b> intensity is found proportional to the fresh gases mass burned by autoignition at low knock intensities, while an exponential increase at the highest intensities suggests the influence of additional factors like the knock location in the cylinder or complex behaviour of knocking combustion...|$|R
5000|$|Jeff Gordon was {{the fastest}} {{in the first}} {{practice}} session {{with a time of}} 27.515 and a speed of 196.257 mph. Kevin Harvick won the pole with a time of 27.325 and a speed of 197.621 mph. “I’m just really proud of everybody on our Budweiser team,” said Harvick. “We’ve been dealt some bad luck throughout the year, but it hasn’t fazed them in continuing to work on the cars and the speed. The first three weeks we have led a bunch of laps and qualified well. Last week had them covered and a <b>valve</b> stem got <b>knocked</b> off by a lug nut. Keep doing the things that you are doing and that luck will all come full circle {{and as long as the}} cars continue to be fast that stuff all comes back to you. Hopefully it peaks at the right time.” [...] "I'm pretty happy to be in the top five, that's better than where we started in May," [...] said Gordon. “Sixth isn't bad; we were 17th in practice, but we have to keep working on it,” said Keselowski. “This is probably our weakest track in Chase." [...] Marcos Ambrose was the fastest in the second practice session with a time of 28.176 and a speed of 191.652 mph. Kyle Larson was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 28.377 and a speed of 190.295 mph. Kurt Busch spun his car exiting turn 4 and got stuck in the grass. He was forced to go to a backup car and will start last. Alex Bowman will also start last after tagging the wall in turn 4 and rolling out the backup car.|$|R
