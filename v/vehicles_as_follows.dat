40|$|The paper {{presents}} the Green eMotion Project, {{the objectives of}} the business models analysis and preliminary results of such analysis. This paper introduces the approach for the business models analysis for electric <b>vehicles,</b> <b>as</b> <b>followed</b> in the FP 7 EU-funded Green eMotion project. The main goal of Green eMotion is to enable a mass deployment of electric mobility in Europe. For that purpose, Green eMotion will connect ongoing regional and national electric mobility initiatives leveraging the results and comparing different technology approaches to ensure the best solutions prevail for the European market. A virtual marketplace will be created to enable the different actors to interact and to allow for new highvalue transportation services as well <b>as</b> electric <b>vehicle</b> (EV) user convenience in billing (EU Clearing House). In addition, the Green eMotion project will demonstrate the integration of electric mobility into electricity networks and contribute to the improvement and development of new and existing standards for electric mobility interfaces. In order to facilitate large-scale EVs roll-out in terms of social acceptance, commercial viability and system/environmental impact, the most suited business models should be identified and assessed according to a methodology taking into account all economic transactions between the different participating stakeholders.

40|$|The {{reactive}} {{component of}} a motion control architecture for a vehicle intended to move in a dynamic and partially known environment is presented in this paper. It is called the execution monitor (EM). Its purpose is to generate commands for the servo-systems of the <b>vehicle</b> so <b>as</b> to <b>follow</b> a given nominal trajectory while reacting in real-time to unexpected events. EM is designed as a fuzzy controller, i. e. a control system based upon fuzzy logic, whose main component {{is a set of}} linguistic rules that encode the reactive behaviour of the vehicle. EM differs from classical fuzzy controllers in two novel ways: first, it introduces a new defuzzification technique, the Barycentre of the Centres Of Area, that permits to better take into account the influence of each and every linguistic rule. Second, weighing coefficients are attached to the rules thus permitting a fine tuning of the vehicle's reactive behaviour. Furthermore it is shown how supervised learning, i. e. learning through samples, [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|The GSLV LVM-3 {{lifted off}} from the second launch pad, Sriharikota, at 9.30 am IST on 18 December 2014. The 630.5 tonne launch <b>vehicle</b> {{stacking}} was <b>as</b> <b>follows</b> : a functional S200 solid propulsion stage, a functional L110 liquid propulsion stage, a non-functional dummy stage (in lieu of CE-20 cryogenic propulsion engine) and finally the 3.7-tonne Crew Module Atmospheric Re-entry Experiment (CARE) payload stage. Just over five minutes into the flight, the rocket ejected CARE {{at an altitude of}} 126 km. CARE then descended at high speed, controlled by its on-board motors. At an altitude of 80 km, the thrusters were shut down and the capsule began its ballistic re-entry into the atmosphere. CARE’s heat shield was expected to experience a temperature of around 1600 °C. ISRO downloaded launch telemetry during the ballistic coasting phase prior to the radio black-out to avoid data loss {{in the event of a}} splash-down failure. At an altitude of around 15 km, the module’s apex cover separated and the parachutes were deployed. CARE splashed down in the Bay of Bengal near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{reactive}} {{component of}} a motion control architecture (called EM) for a car-like vehicle intended to move in dynamic and partially known environments is presented in this paper. Its purpose is to generate commands for the servo-systems of the <b>vehicle</b> so <b>as</b> to <b>follow</b> a given nominal trajectory while reacting in real-time to unexpected events. EM is designed as a fuzzy controller. A behaviour-based approach is used {{to set up the}} fuzzy rule base: the overall behaviour of the vehicle results from the combination of several basic behaviours (trajectory following, obstacle avoidance, etc.). This approach permits an easy and incremental construction of the fuzzy rule base and also to develop and test the basic behaviours separately. EM has been implemented and tested on a real computer-controlled car equipped with sensors of limited precision and reliability. Experimental results obtained with the prototype vehicle are presented. They demonstrate the capability of EM to actually control a real vehicle and to perform trajectory following and obstacle avoidance in real outdoor environments by using simple fuzzy behaviours relying upon low-resolution sensor data...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of self-driving vehicles is growing rapidly. The {{goal of this}} research is to investigate the possibilities of self-driving <b>vehicles</b> <b>as</b> public transport. Based on development, existing projects and existing public transport systems a suitable system of self-driving <b>vehicles</b> <b>as</b> public transport is determined. Rotterdam is used as a case-study in this research. Three potential locations for a service of self-driving <b>vehicles</b> <b>as</b> access/egress mode are selected. The number of trips for self-driving <b>vehicle</b> <b>as</b> public transport for these test locations is modelled using the OmniTRANS-model in Rotterdam. An access/egress mode choice model is estimated to calculate the number of trips for the self-driving vehicle and bike. For the test locations the results of the model show a 25 % to 59 % share of the number of trips for self-driving <b>vehicles</b> <b>as</b> access/egress mode.
