[...] Not only is it the towering presence of Ray himself, and the joy of observing the sheer brainpower of my fellow faculty at work, {{it is also the}} people, literally from around the world, who enroll in this and other CSICOP functions that keep me from suffering that occupational hazard 'skeptic's burnout.' [...] They are a remarkable lot, genuinely nice people committed to critical thinking and leaving the place a bit better than they found it.

500|$|... d.In 1994, {{the three}} major {{networks}} devoted 1,592 total minutes to covering the Simpson criminal case; while ABC had 423, CBS had 580 and NBC 589. The Simpson trial was the number-one news story for NBC and CBS in 1995, while at ABC, coverage of the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina dominated the newscast. Jennings stated in a 1996 interview that he was satisfied that ABC came in third in terms of O.J. coverage. [...] "I'm <b>very</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> it didn't crowd out {{as much of the}} rest of the world on World News Tonight as it did on other broadcasts," [...] he said. [...] "I am very pleased it was not our major story of last year as it was at other networks." ...|$|E

It is therefore <b>very</b> <b>pleasing</b> <b>that</b> so many key members of that successful side can still be seen regularly at Green Lane some twenty-five years later. They include Colin Beer, Geoff Costello, Graham Drage, Roger Judson, John Royle, Brian Wilkinson and Roger Wilkinson. Our Club Solicitor, Philip Davies, was also a member of that great team.|$|R

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta, and {{directed}} by Ken Kwapis. [...] "Company Picnic" [...] was the 100th overall episode of The Office, and show creator Greg Daniels said he was especially proud the series made it to that landmark because he felt it meant he did not disappoint Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who created the original British version of the show. Daniels said, [...] "I remember interviewing with them seven years ago, and this (100th episode) was certainly the goal, so I'm <b>very</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> we got to 100 episodes in a strong fashion. I think the show {{is in a very}} good place right now." [...] Steve Carell said he was especially pleased with the landmark because when the show began, people had doubts it would live up to the original series and were skeptical about its mockumentary style: [...] "It's sort of remarkable, especially with this show because I don't think anybody felt it would go past the pilot. ... I think most everyone was kind of dubious about our chances of pulling it off." [...] Likewise, Ben Silverman, co-chairman of NBC Entertainment and an Office executive producer, said, [...] "It's a thrill that we got to 100 episodes, and probably incredibly surprising looking back at the process it took. But the reality is, we believed in it." ...|$|E
500|$|Corzine was subpoenaed {{to appear}} before a House {{committee}} on December 8, 2011, to answer questions regarding 1.2 billion dollars of missing money from MF Global client accounts. He testified before the committee, [...] "I simply {{do not know where}} the money is, or why the accounts have not been reconciled to date", and that given the number of money transfers {{in the final days of}} trading at MF Global, he didn't know specifics of the movement of the funds. He also denied authorizing any misuse of customer funds. In March 2012, Bloomberg reported on a memo produced by congressional investigators that quoted an internal company e-mail relating to a $175 million transfer which was a subject of their investigation. Initial media reports suggested impropriety on Mr. Corzine's part, but this was later disproved. According to the New York Times, the employee responsible for the transfer e-mailed Mr. Corzine stating the transfer was a [...] "House Wire", meaning it came from the firm's own account. The instructions Mr. Corzine had given were to deal with several overdrafts at JPMorgan Chase, but never related to any specific accounts or specific transfers made. A spokesperson for Mr. Corzine responded that Corzine [...] "never directed Ms. O’Brien or anyone else regarding which account should be used to cure the overdrafts, and he never directed that customer funds should be used for that purpose. Nor was he informed that customer funds had been used for that purpose." [...] In fact, as the New York Times reported, Mr. Corzine had been given specific assurances that the transfer in question was proper, and that no customer funds had been used. Subsequent court filings also attest to this fact. On November 5, 2013 The New York Times reported that MF Global customers would likely recover 100 percent of their funds. A spokesman for Mr. Corzine said [...] "Mr. Corzine is <b>very</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> all customers will receive a full recovery. This is a great outcome, which has been anticipated for many months." [...] Customers have since received distributions making them whole.|$|E

[...] Craigslist countersued in May 2008 [...] "to remedy the substantial and ongoing harm to fair competition" [...] that Craigslist claimed was constituted by eBay's actions as a Craigslist shareholder. In September 2010, Delaware Judge William Chandler ruled that the actions of Craigslist were unlawful and that the actions taken by Craigslist founders Jim Buckmaster and Craig Newmark had [...] "breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty", and restored eBay's {{stake in the company}} to 28.4% from a diluted level of 24.85%. However, the judge dismissed eBay's objection to a staggered board provision, citing that Craigslist has the right to protect its own trade secrets. eBay spokesman Michael Jacobson stated [...] "We are <b>very</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> the court gave eBay what it sought from the lawsuit." ...|$|E
