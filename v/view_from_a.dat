25|$|Paul Cézanne {{had begun}} as an Impressionist but his aim – {{to make a}} logical {{construction}} of reality based on a <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> single point, with modulated color in flat areas – became {{the basis of a}} new visual art, later to be developed into Cubism by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso.|$|E

25|$|Observing that {{philosophers}} often seek {{to deduce}} their total <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> few basic principles, showing how everything follows from their intuitively based axioms, Nozick compares {{such an approach}} to building a tower by piling one brick on top of another: if the brick at the bottom crumbles or is removed, everything collapses, and even the insights that were independent of the starting point are lost. He suggests instead that the Parthenon should be the model for philosophy, and advocates an explanatory model of philosophical activity rather than an argumentative or coercive one.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it is not}} {{the only}} film of the shooting, it has been called the most complete, giving a {{relatively}} clear <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> somewhat elevated position on the side from which the president's head wound is visible. It was an important part of the Warren Commission hearings and all subsequent investigations of the assassination, and is one of the most studied pieces of film in history. Of greatest notoriety is the film's capture of the fatal shot to President Kennedy's head when his presidential limousine was almost exactly in front of, and slightly below, Zapruder's position.|$|E
25|$|The Capitol View Historic District is {{contained}} within Section 4, Township 1 North, and Range 12 West of Little Rock, Arkansas. Its most distinctive features include a river <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> bluff {{high above the}} Arkansas River as well as, appropriately, {{a view of the}} Arkansas State Capitol from numerous vantage points both north and south of Markham Street, which bisects the district and divides it into two unequal parts. Its varied topography, characterized by substantial variation in elevation enhances the possibilities of scenic overlooks and, no doubt, was a principal attraction for developers {{in the late nineteenth and}} first quarter of the twentieth century. The district has remained almost exclusively residential in character throughout its history. A handful of duplexes, three apartment buildings and a pair of grocery stores are the only exceptions among the 501 buildings included in the Capitol View historic district.|$|E

25|$|The {{religion}} and belief {{system of the}} Indus Valley people have received considerable attention, especially from the view of identifying precursors to deities and religious practices of Indian religions that later developed in the area. However, due to the sparsity of evidence, which is open to varying interpretations, {{and the fact that}} the Indus script remains undeciphered, the conclusions are partly speculative and largely based on a retrospective <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> much later Hindu perspective. An early and influential work in the area that set the trend for Hindu interpretations of archaeological evidence from the Harappan sites was that of John Marshall, who in 1931 identified the following as prominent features of the Indus religion: a Great Male God and a Mother Goddess; deification or veneration of animals and plants; symbolic representation of the phallus (linga) and vulva (yoni); and, use of baths and water in religious practice. Marshall's interpretations have been much debated, and sometimes disputed over the following decades.|$|E
25|$|Among {{theories}} {{advanced to}} account for the reddish sky in the background is the artist's memory {{of the effects of the}} powerful volcanic eruption of Krakatoa, which deeply tinted sunset skies red in parts of the Western hemisphere for months during 1883 and 1884, about a decade before Munch painted The Scream. This explanation has been disputed by scholars, who note that Munch was an expressive painter and was not primarily interested in literal renderings of what he had seen. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the proximity of both a slaughterhouse and a lunatic asylum to the site depicted in the painting may have offered some inspiration. The scene was identified as being the <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> road overlooking Oslo, the Oslofjord and Hovedøya, from the hill of Ekeberg. At the time of painting the work, Munch's manic depressive sister Laura Catherine was a patient at the asylum at the foot of Ekeberg.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{generally}} {{found the}} series to be unusual. CBC critic Stephen Cole commented that What It's Like Being Alone has [...] "arguably the most surreal opening sequence in TV history" [...] with {{a shift in}} <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> black and white Canadian flag to the orphan characters. [...] He questioned whether the show indicated the CBC had adopted [...] "Addams Family values" [...] and {{said that it was}} [...] "the wildest CBC comedy since Twitch City." ...|$|E
500|$|The BBC Four revival {{beginning}} in 2005 with A <b>View</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Hill was greeted warmly by Sarah Dempster, who {{stated that the}} programme was, [...] "in every respect, a vintage Ghost Story for Christmas production. There are the powdery academics hamstrung by extreme social awkwardness. There is the bumbling protagonist bemused by a particular aspect of modern life. There are stunning, panoramic shots of a specific area of the British landscape (here, a heavily autumnal Suffolk). There is the determined lack of celebrity pizzazz. There is tweed. And there is, crucially, a single moment of heart-stopping, corner-of-the-eye horror that suggests life, for one powdery academic at least, {{will never be the}} same again." ...|$|E
500|$|Control of the TDR-1 {{would be}} {{conducted}} from either a control aircraft, usually a Grumman TBF Avenger, with the operator viewing a tv screen showing the <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> camera mounted aboard the drone {{along with the}} radar altimeter's readout, or via a pilot on board the TDR-1 for test flights. Powered by two Lycoming O-435 engines of [...] each, the TDR-1 used a remarkably simple design, with a steel-tube frame constructed by the Schwinn bicycle company covered with a molded wood skin, thus making little use of strategic materials {{so as not to}} impede production of higher priority aircraft. Capable of being optionally piloted for test flights, an aerodynamic fairing was used to cover the cockpit area during operational missions. The TDR-1 was equipped with a fixed tricycle landing gear that would be jettisoned in operation after takeoff for improved performance.|$|E

500|$|Alex Chan, 27 {{years old}} at the time of the civil unrest, was a French-born {{freelance}} industrial designer whose parents were Chinese immigrants from Hong Kong. Although Chan was successful professionally, he felt that there was racial and cultural discrimination in France, based on his own previous attempts to find housing and violence directed towards him. He lived in Seine-Saint-Denis, a suburb of Paris, near housing projects where rioting had caused the destruction of cars owned by acquaintances. In the aftermath of the unrest, Chan was dissatisfied, stating that [...] "the media, especially in the United States, ... linked what was happening, the riots, to terrorism and put the blame on the Muslim community". Chan wanted instead to depict [...] "more human" [...] rioters who turned to violence in response to racism. According to Chan, the title The French Democracy is meant to be ironic, in that the youths express themselves by rioting rather than through the political system. He elaborated: a shortcut made with The Movies technology about the recent events concerning riots in French suburbs. This movie is trying to help people have a better understanding of the origin of these events, as some reasons that pushed all this youth to have such violent acts. As a matter of fact TFD offers a sincere inside <b>view</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> French citizen who lives in one of these neighborhoods where the riots took place. This fictional documentary is strongly inspired by real events and reactions and tries to make the spectator think more about how French society could and should potentially be.|$|E
