5000|$|Three main subclasses exist: PH37ACmi for UK railways, PH37ACi {{a version}} for {{mainland}} Europe and elsewhere built to UIC 505-1 <b>vehicle</b> <b>gauge,</b> and PH37ACmai a version for [...] gauge lines.|$|E
50|$|The 11 acre {{terminal}} is sited on {{the southern}} edge of Hams Hall business park; since 2004 it has had customs clearance to handle international traffic via the Channel Tunnel; the site has storage for 6000 TEU, and rail access is cleared to W10 <b>vehicle</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|E
50|$|The subtype PH37ACmi was {{originally}} built for Freightliner UK with the TOPS designation given Class 70. The design is built to <b>vehicle</b> <b>gauge</b> defined by drawing 'UK L-A1-1806', {{with a mass}} of 129 tonnes, Route Availability of RA7, fuel tank capacity of 6000 L and starting tractive effort of 544 kN. The locomotives have a hood unit design, with two cabs.|$|E
50|$|They {{are used}} {{extensively}} in Switzerland and in Spain, {{in the latter}} country to transport standard <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles</b> on broad <b>gauge</b> lines.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of highly non-linear friction damping in the suspensions of many freight vehicles reduces prediction accuracy when using traditional kinematic gauging techniques. These techniques, {{which are often}} applied to the more linear behaving passenger vehicles, {{are based on the}} quasi-static suspension behaviour. Due to this limitation and a market requirement for cost effective and rapid <b>vehicle</b> <b>gauging,</b> the current approach in the UK for freight vehicles is to use static <b>vehicle</b> <b>gauges.</b> This method can be very conservative and lead to in-efficient use of the available space between vehicle and infrastructure. Computer simulation-based dynamic gauging techniques offer a way to maximize the use of the space available, by introducing into the gauging analysis, the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle. This paper describes the process of dynamic gauging for friction damped freight vehicles. The benefits of this method in terms of potential increase of the vehicle size are shown, but also difficulties within the process, especially concerning the adequate validation of the simulation models...|$|R

50|$|A subtype PH37Aci {{has been}} {{designed}} to be built to fit within the UIC 505-1 <b>vehicle</b> <b>gauge.</b> Unlike the original version built for the UK loading gauge the design has a full width body. There are two versions of the design, one with a 20 t axle load and 450 kN starting tractive effort intended for European railways, and a 21 t axleload version with more powerful traction motors and starting tractive effort of 544 kN. The versions have axleload class L620 and L621 as defined by European Standard EN 15528 (2008).|$|E
50|$|Typical bicycle speedometers {{measure the}} time between each wheel revolution, and give a readout on a small, handlebar-mounted digital display. The sensor is mounted on the bike at a fixed location, pulsing when the spoke-mounted magnet passes by. In this way, it is {{analogous}} to an electronic car speedometer using pulses from an ABS sensor, but with a much cruder time/distance resolution - typically one pulse/display update per revolution, or as seldom as once every 2-3 seconds at low speed with a 26-inch (2.07m circumference, without tire) wheel. However, this is rarely a critical problem, and the system provides frequent updates at higher road speeds where the information is of more importance. The low pulse frequency also has little impact on measurement accuracy, as these digital devices can be programmed by wheel size, or additionally by wheel or tire circumference {{in order to make}} distance measurements more accurate and precise than a typical motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>gauge.</b> However these devices carry some minor disadvantage in requiring power from batteries that must be replaced every so often in the receiver (AND sensor, for wireless models), and, in wired models, the signal being carried by a thin cable that is much less robust than that used for brakes, gears, or cabled speedometers.|$|E
40|$|Low-flatcar wagons {{represent}} a good alternative to freight truck transportation. In fact, the whole truck {{can be easily}} loaded on these wagons. However, due to the railway <b>vehicle</b> <b>gauge,</b> these vehicles present a particular design with an important impact on {{the dynamics of the}} trainset and on its derailment risk. The present work aims at analysing the dynamic behaviour of the trainset and the influence of the freight train composition on the derailment risk. Numerical simulations have been performed to identify the most critical conditions. Then, an experimental campaign has been carried out to evaluate the derailment risk associated to these conditions...|$|E

50|$|A three plus three digit class {{designation}} system was used {{from the late}} 1950s - the first digit indicated the power type of vehicle: 3 indicated a 3 kV DC locomotive; 4, a 25 kV AC loco; 6 diesel electric; 7 diesel hydraulic; 8 diesel mechanical and 9 an infrastructure or works vehicle. The second digit indicated the <b>vehicles</b> <b>gauge</b> and axle arrangement: 0, a narrow gauge railcar; 1, a standard gauge railcar; numbers 2 to 6 indicated a locomotive with that number of driving axles. The third digit indicated different classes within the type description. The fourth digit indicated class subtypes, and the last two digits the vehicle number (starting at 01).|$|R

50|$|A {{special feature}} is the Zwickau model of {{tram-train}} operations. BOStrab-compliant RegioSprinters of the Vogtlandbahn run over tram tracks to the Zwickau central (Zentrum) tram stop. Tram-trains run from the Zwickau-Schwarzenberg line at street level to the Stadthalle tram stop. The metre-gauge line has a third rail fitted to allow standard <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles</b> to continue to the Zentrum tram stop. The RegioSprinters are diesel-powered {{as most of the}} Vogtlandbahn network is not electrified and the vehicles are slightly narrower than normal because the tram line does not have sufficient clearance for full-width standard <b>gauge</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} for automatically validating the internal lighting system of an automobile by assessing the visual quality of each instrument in an instrument cluster (IC) (i. e., <b>vehicle</b> <b>gauges,</b> such as speedometer, tachometer, temperature and fuel gauges) {{based on the}} user’s perceptions. Although the visual quality assessment of an instrument is a subjective matter, it is also influenced by some of its photometric features, such as the light intensity distribution. This work presents a methodology for identifying and quantifying non-homogeneous regions in the lighting distribution of these instruments, starting from a digital image. In order to accomplish this task, a set of 107 digital images of instruments were acquired and preprocessed, identifying a set of instrument regions. These instruments were also evaluated by common drivers and specialists to identify their non-homogenous regions. Then, for each region, we extracted a set of homogeneity descriptors, and also proposed a relational descriptor to study the homogeneity influence of a region in the whole instrument. These descriptors {{were associated with the}} results of the manual labeling, and given to two machine learning algorithms, which were trained to identify a region as being homogeneous or not. Experiments showed that the proposed methodology obtained an overall precision above 94 % for both regions and instrument classifications. Finally, a meticulous analysis of the users’ and specialist’s image evaluations is performe...|$|R
50|$|It {{is worth}} noting that as the tread-bearing loading environments begin to {{manifest}} themselves, the same impact loads which cause trouble with conventional frogs will return. They are almost exclusively found in rail yards, where rail vehicles operate at or below 10 mph, due to the reduction of guidance keeping the <b>vehicles</b> in the <b>gauge</b> through the turnout.|$|R
5000|$|Lift frogs {{are used}} in {{turnouts}} where the through (straight) route is heavily used, and the diverging (curved) route is only used on occasion and at low speed. The frog is tread-bearing, with a normal rail surface, on the through route, and is flange-bearing on the diverging route. The name {{is derived from the}} wheel on the diverging rail being lifted over the through rail. No guard rail is required on the through route, but is critical on the diverging route to keep rail <b>vehicles</b> in <b>gauge.</b> Common applications are set-out tracks or lightly used industry tracks (both of which are special types of sidings diverging from high-speed, high-tonnage mainlines.) ...|$|R
