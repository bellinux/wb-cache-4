Agricultural cooperatives contribute to improving the productivity of small farms and make possible access to product marketing, savings, credit, insurance and technology.

Switching to mechanical harvesting frequently requires the transformation of a farming operation, e. g., new crop varieties, new field configurations, and new packing processes. In addition, a significant capital outlay is frequently required. Progress in mechanization varies a great deal across fruit and vegetable crops...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the status of labor-saving mechanization in U. S. fruit and <b>vegetable</b> <b>harvesting.</b> Fruit and vegetable harvest mechanization has several potential advantages: reduced harvest costs, eliminate problems associated with finding good quality harvest labor, permit longer harvesting days, and reduce exposure of harvest to human bacteria. �������� Commercial mechanical harvesters for processed tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, carrots, tart cherries, apples, grapes, peaches, plums and grapes are in the hands of growers. To my surprise, considerable progress has been made on fresh market sweet cherry, apple and berry harvesters, and in the next few years commercial sales of these machines are expected. A negative shock to labor harvest-labor availability or jump in the harvester wage or piece rate could rapidly accelerate adoption of the best mechanical harvesting technologies by growers and processors. �mechanized harvesting; fruits; vegetables; processing; fresh market; labor availability; United States...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the importance of small field irrigation canals (abu eshreens) —of which there are over 22 000 in the Gezira Scheme— in the transmission of schistosomiasis. The observations were made during a 12 -month period, November 1976 —November 1977. The results indicated that during the 4 -year crop rotation the abu eshreens supported snail populations in only two seasons, when they were irrigating crops of either, cotton or groundnuts. Thus, when agricultural labourers built temporary dwellings on the abu eshreen banks during these periods, the probability of finding infected snails was high. The maximum risk periods occurred during <b>vegetable</b> <b>harvesting</b> (including groundnuts) (October—December) and in the cotton picking season (January—April). Certain special situations lead to some abu eshreens playing an even greater and more predictable role in transmission. These occur when abu eshreens: (a) irrigate eucalyptus or fruit trees; (b) irrigate a block inspector's garden; or (c) are situated very close to permanent villages. Possible control measures to reduce the transmission potential of abu eshreens are discussed. These include improved maintenance {{and the use of}} either focally sprayed or slow-release molluscicides...|$|E
40|$|Overuse of {{chemical}} fertilizer and/or manure in agriculture {{is a principal}} factor in water eutrophication in China. Our previous study indicated that reducing chemical fertilizer input effectively decreased the soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in an intensive vegetable cropping system in the coastal area of southeast Lake Dianchi, China. This study aimed to decrease the input–output balance, namely the nutrient balance between input of fertilizer and output through <b>vegetable</b> <b>harvesting,</b> by reducing chemical fertilizer application without yield loss. A pot experiment was performed using chemical fertilizer with different amounts of N, P, and K on soils from six vegetable fields’ representative of the study area. High nitrate concentration in soils 2, 3, and 6 resulted in high N absorption from soil, and low N absorption from chemical fertilizer. Moreover, the responses of dry matter production to N absorbed from chemical fertilizer were less sensitive in soils 2, 3, and 6 {{than those in the}} other soils. Accordingly, reducing N input {{of chemical}} fertilizer did not decrease total N absorption or dry matter production, which should be the reason why reducing N input of chemical fertilizer did not reduce dry matter production in soils 2, 3, and 6. In the cases of soils 1, 4, and 5, reducing N input of chemical fertilizer reduced dry matter production, owing to lower levels of soil nitrate. This study should be helpful for reducing nutrient surplus from chemical fertilizer in the coastal area of southeast Lake Dianchi and other eutrophic agricultural areas in China...|$|E

Harvesting of many non-cultivated or wild single-stemmed palms results in palm tree death (e.g. Geonoma edulis). However, other palm species are clonal or multi-stemmed plants (e.g. Prestoea acuminata, Euterpe oleracea) and {{moderate}} harvesting will not kill the entire clonal palm.

40|$|Heavy metal {{concentrations}} were estimated in five leafy vegetables (Solanum nigrum, Brassica oleraceae, Lactuca sativa, Amaranthus hybridus and Corchorus olitorius) from urban and periurban sites in Ngaoundere (Cameroon) using an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). Vegetable {{samples were collected}} at the two stages of maturity: stage I (60 days) and stage II (90 days) for analysis. The {{results showed that the}} concentrations of heavy metals in all vegetables were greater in urban site than in periurban site. The highest concentrations of Fe (673. 92 mg/kg DW), Cu (10. 42 mg/kg), Cd (1. 70 mg/kg DW), and Pb (31. 75 mg/kg DW) were recorded in Lactuca sativa, Zn (94. 60 mg/kg DW) in Solanum nigrum, and Ni (16. 91 mg/kg DW) in Corchorus olitorius. The concentrations of Cu, and Pb were greater in roots than in aerial parts, while Fe, Cd, Ni and Zn {{concentrations were}} greater in aerial parts than in roots. Some of the concentrations of Ni, Zn and Pb in crops reached the critical level for plant growth. In general, the results indicated that the consumption of leafy <b>vegetables</b> <b>harvested</b> at the stage II potentially provides the greatest amount of heavy metals. The transportation index (Ti) decreased in <b>vegetables</b> <b>harvested</b> at the stage II for Fe, Cu, Cd and Zn but slightly increased for Ni and Pb, suggesting that heavy metal transportation from roots to aerial parts depends on the plant phenology and metal species. In all farms and at the two stages of maturity, the lead concentrations in all vegetables were more than the FAO/WHO maximum recommended level in leafy vegetable for human consumption. Moreover, all vegetables had some Cd concentrations that were higher than limits set by FAO/WHO. So, they are not suitable for human consumption...|$|R
