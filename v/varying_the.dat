5|$|Alchemists {{thought of}} mercury as the First Matter {{from which all}} metals were formed. They {{believed}} that different metals could be produced by <b>varying</b> <b>the</b> {{quality and quantity of}} sulfur contained within the mercury. The purest of these was gold, and mercury was called for in attempts at the transmutation of base (or impure) metals into gold, which was the goal of many alchemists.|$|E
5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down transformer and for direct current models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either <b>varying</b> <b>the</b> number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by <b>varying</b> <b>the</b> distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E

On 1 April 1894, with the proposed extension to Oxford still intended, the O exercised a clause of the 1888 Act and took over the Tramway. Work began on upgrading the line {{in preparation for the}} extension. The line from Quainton Road to Brill was relaid with improved rails on transverse sleepers, replacing the original flimsy rails and longitudinal sleepers. At around this time two Manning Wardle locomotives were brought into use.|$|E

5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} is {{the study}} of the chemical reactions that are catalysed by enzymes. In enzyme kinetics, the reaction rate is measured and the effects of <b>varying</b> <b>the</b> conditions of the reaction are investigated.

5|$|GR is {{the better}} known of the two romanization systems which {{indicate}} the four tones of Mandarin by <b>varying</b> <b>the</b> spelling of syllables ("tonal spelling"). These tones are as fundamental to the Chinese language as vowels are to English; their presence lets speakers discriminate between otherwise identical syllables and words. Other systems indicate the tones with either diacritics (for example Pinyin: āi, ái, ǎi and ài) or numbers (Wade–Giles: ai1, ai2, etc.). GR spells the same four tones ai, air, ae and ay. These spellings, which follow specific rules, indicate the tones while retaining the pronunciation of the syllable ai.|$|E

5|$|In chemistry, {{peptides}} are synthesized by {{a variety}} of reactions. One of the most-used in solid-phase peptide synthesis uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units. These are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain, which is attached to a solid resin support. The ability to easily synthesize vast numbers of different peptides by <b>varying</b> <b>the</b> types and order of amino acids (using combinatorial chemistry) has made peptide synthesis particularly important in creating libraries of peptides for use in drug discovery through high-throughput screening.|$|E

5|$|Most sponges work {{rather like}} chimneys: they {{take in water}} {{at the bottom and}} eject it from the osculum ("little mouth") at the top. Since ambient {{currents}} are faster at the top, the suction effect that they produce by Bernoulli's principle does some of the work for free. Sponges can control the water flow by various combinations of wholly or partially closing the osculum and ostia (the intake pores) and <b>varying</b> <b>the</b> beat of the flagella, and may shut it down if {{there is a lot of}} sand or silt in the water.|$|E

By <b>varying</b> <b>the</b> weight of the aggregate material in the concrete, the weight of the concrete could be altered, allowing lighter layers to be laid at the top of concrete domes. But concrete domes also required expensive wooden formwork, also called shuttering, to be built and kept in place during the curing process, which would usually have to be destroyed to be removed. Formwork for brick domes need not be kept in place as long and could be more easily reused.|$|E
