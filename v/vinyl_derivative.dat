To identify putative regulators involved in the PASR, random transposon mutagenesis, combined with two different screens, was performed.

This is in contrast with what occurs in other gram-positive bacteria, in which padR is autoregulated and induced by phenolic acids. Further screening of the transposon library failed to identify genes other than padR involved in the PASR. Modest inactivation of padR by phenolic acids was obtained in recombinant Escherichia coli expressing padC and padR, and this translates into induction of decarboxylase activity. Gel shift promoter binding assays performed with and without MgCl 2, and with and without phenolic acids, demonstrated that phenolic acids were able to abolish the binding of PadR to the yveFG-padC promoter in the absence of MgCl 2. Altogether, our results indicate that (i) PadR is inactivated directly by phenolic acids in vitro, (ii) inhibition of PadR in response to phenolic acids may occur without the need for a sensor-like effector in B. subtilis, and (iii) phenolic acids are able to modulate PadR activity in E. coli in the absence of any additional effector...|$|R
