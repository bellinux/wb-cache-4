5000|$|The {{most common}} size is {{identical}} to the European number plates' size (110 x 520 mm) [...] However, a shorter plate is also common (120 x 440 mm). Most car dealerships now issue the former. Other shapes such as American and motorbike sizes are also available. Number plates can be made over the counter at registration/licensing stores in shopping centers, although the <b>vehicle</b> <b>registration</b> <b>document</b> may be required.|$|E

5000|$|RDW <b>vehicle</b> <b>registration</b> {{plates are}} {{assigned}} bearing the same [...] "number" [...] (a sequence of characters composed {{of letters and}} digits) as that shown on the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>registration</b> <b>document.</b> The numbering scheme used bears {{no relation to the}} place of a <b>vehicle's</b> <b>registration</b> or ownership, and numbers - which are issued in strict time order - identify the vehicle, not its owner. Thus, if a vehicle changes ownership, the registration number remains unchanged.|$|R
50|$|According to Polish law, the {{registration}} plate {{is tied to}} the vehicle, not the owner. There is no possibility for the owner to keep the licence number for use on a different car, even if it's a custom number. The licence plates are issued by the powiat (county) of the vehicle owner's registered address of residence, {{in the case of a}} natural person. If it is owned by a legal person, the place of registration is determined by the address of its seat. Vehicles leased under operating leases and many de facto finance leases will be registered at the seat of the lessor. When a vehicle changes hands, the new owner must apply for new <b>vehicle</b> <b>registration</b> <b>document</b> bearing his or her name and registered address. The new owner may obtain a new licence plate although it is not necessary when new owner's residence address lies in the same area as the previous owner's. In such a situation the licence plates are usually carried over to the new owner, because the change carries an additional cost. Upon purchasing a vehicle from another person, if the vehicle has an EU plate, the new owner must replace it with a license for their address and area, and give the EU plate to their powiat plate mint to free up numbers in the future. If the car has a pre- May 1, 2006 plate, the owner is free to do whatever they wish with it, as long as it's legal with the Polish law. The plaque cannot be replaced if destroyed. The change of the whole set is required.|$|E
50|$|In Hungary every {{vehicle is}} {{required}} to be tested (technical test, Műszaki vizsga) for road worthiness and emission. In case of passenger cars the first inspection is after four years for new vehicles, and every two years afterwards. Inspection decals are placed on the rear license plate, {{and it is also}} <b>documented</b> in the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>registration</b> <b>document.</b>|$|R
25|$|The UK Government {{introduced}} on 1 August 2008 regulations {{requiring the}} production of personal identification and <b>vehicle</b> <b>registration</b> <b>documents</b> when having number plates made by a retailer. The organisation that makes the plate is required to display their name and postcode, usually in small print at bottom centre, to aid in tracing false plates and their purchaser. This requirement was introduced in 2001 when the new character style and two-digit year identifier came into force, and applies to all registration plates made after that date regardless of {{the year of the}} vehicle.|$|R
500|$|Acquisition of Driver’s License: The Personal Identification Number (PIN) {{is one of}} the {{required}} information the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) demands as soon as the Lebanese Identity Card is issued to applicants. The PIN is captured on a Lebanese Identity Card holder's driver’s license and <b>vehicle</b> <b>registration</b> <b>documents.</b> The personal information is also verified from the NIA to determine [...] a persons true identity for license acquisition and establish the true identities of vehicle owners. A time will come when a person {{may not be able to}} make new registration or renewal at the DVLA without their Lebanese Identity Card.|$|R
50|$|Since January 1, 2014, the Netherlands has an all plastic <b>vehicle</b> <b>{{registration}}</b> {{on credit}} card format. This and the driving licence (which {{is the same}} size) are the only {{things you have to}} carry with you while driving in the Netherlands. This registration looks the same (green) for every vehicle category, only the information on the card differs. It has a chip which contains more detailed information about the vehicle. All previously issued <b>vehicle</b> <b>registrations</b> will remain valid until the car changes ownership, or until when the owner requests replacement <b>vehicle</b> <b>registration</b> <b>documents</b> to be issued. While you previously needed a so-called overschrijvingsbewijs (a separate document that came with the <b>vehicle</b> <b>registration)</b> in order to sell your vehicle, this has now been replaced with a code. If you bring the registration card and the correct code you can sell the vehicle, even {{if you do not have}} the original letter (that comes with the new car registration) stating the code.|$|R
50|$|Thirty-five {{percent of}} Vučitrn {{respondents}} {{reported that they had}} visited the municipal office during the previous 12 months to request a document (such as a birth certificate or a building permit) or a service. A slightly higher proportion than Kosovo's average (84% compared to 82%) reported that their request was fulfilled, whereas 6% reported that they were only sometimes provided with the requested document or service. Higher percentages of Vučitrn residents compared to Kosovo's averages said that the Public Administration was efficient or very efficient in issuing all of the following documents: passports (87%), ID cards (90%), <b>vehicle</b> <b>registration</b> <b>documents</b> (79%), driver's licenses (84%), building permits (73%), business licenses (70%), marriage, birth, and death certificates (87%), and Social Assistance cards (69%).|$|R

50|$|Motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>{{registration}}</b> is {{the registration}} of {{a motor vehicle}} with a government authority, either compulsory or otherwise. The purpose of motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>registration</b> {{is to establish a}} link between a vehicle and an owner or user of the vehicle. This link might be used for taxation or crime detection purposes. While almost all motor vehicles are uniquely identified by a vehicle identification number, only registered vehicles display a <b>vehicle</b> <b>registration</b> plate and carry a <b>vehicle</b> <b>registration</b> certificate. Motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>registration</b> is different from motor vehicle licensing and roadworthiness certification.|$|R
