5|$|Wail and Waleed al-Shehri {{disappeared}} {{after going}} to Medina, calling their father just once; in the conversation, the brothers were <b>vague</b> <b>about</b> {{when they would}} return. Both had expressed interest in joining the jihad in Chechnya, though may have been diverted to Afghanistan. Before disappearing, the Shehri brothers went to Al-Seqley Mosque {{to swear an oath}} and commitment to jihad, as did Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi. Wail presided over the ceremony, dubbing himself Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi after one of Muhammad's companions.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{accepted}} his nomination {{in a letter}} dated December 19, 1839. At age 66 then (67 by the election), he was the oldest presidential candidate to that point. He pledged to serve only one term, but was <b>vague</b> <b>about</b> other stances, writing that his public career made stating his positions unnecessary. There was no party platform; most Whigs did not favor binding candidates to a legislative plan. If the Whigs did not leave Harrisburg completely united, they achieved this within weeks of the convention. A testimonial dinner to Senator Clay in Washington on December 11, attended by convention delegates and other politicians, healed many wounds, {{and a series of}} huge public meetings, held to ratify the nominations of Harrison and Tyler, showed the Whigs willing to put the nomination fight behind them.|$|E
25|$|Sequoyah's heroic status has led {{to several}} {{competing}} accounts of his life that are speculative, contradictory, or fabricated. As noted by John B. Davis, {{there were very few}} primary documents describing facts of Sequoyah's life. Some anecdotes were passed down orally, but these often conflict or are <b>vague</b> <b>about</b> times and places.|$|E

25|$|Christie {{has been}} purposefully <b>vague</b> <b>about</b> Poirot's origins, {{as he is}} thought to be an elderly man even in the early novels. In An Autobiography, she {{admitted}} that she already imagined him to be an old man in 1920. At the time, however, she had no idea she would write works featuring him for decades to come.|$|E
25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} is very <b>vague</b> <b>about</b> {{the ways to}} determine when splitting happens, and nowadays usually the criterion {{is that the two}} branches have decohered. However, present day understanding of decoherence does not allow a completely precise, self-contained way to say when the two branches have decohered/"do not interact", and hence many-worlds interpretation remains arbitrary. This objection is saying that {{it is not clear what}} is precisely meant by branching, and point to the lack of self-contained criteria specifying branching.|$|E
25|$|The {{next morning}} the villagers attend church to commemorate Candlemas. The hunters seek {{purification}} and are urged by their pastor to side with Germany and continue {{the search for the}} prisoners. At this insistence Hilde finds herself telling Hannes' secret to her mother. The story is <b>vague</b> <b>about</b> how this information is relayed to Pesendorfer, but, he finds and kills the prisoner, then takes Hannes away to beat him for his misconduct. Hilde recalls cleaning the blood from her brother's face after the beating. The following day, she finds that Hannes has been hanged for his actions. Her guilt in the causation of two deaths is evident through her narration.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am alone, I am alone," [...] he wailed feebly, groping <b>vaguely</b> <b>about</b> {{with his}} {{trembling}} hands. [...] "Is there anybody near me? Is there anybody? I am afraid of this strange place." ...|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>vaguely</b> <b>about</b> at {{the fire}} that was already fading, and there among the ashes lay two shining things that had survived the fire, his sword and Turnbull's, fallen {{haphazard}} {{in the pattern of}} a cross.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother, I have {{something}} to ask you," [...] he said. Her eyes wandered <b>vaguely</b> <b>about</b> the room. She made no answer. [...] "Tell me the truth. I {{have a right to}} know. Were you married to my father?" ...|$|R
25|$|Others defend Microsoft's use {{of product}} activation. The Harrison Group, a market {{research}} firm, {{conducted a study}} sponsored by Microsoft in 2011 illustrating that computers running activated versions of Windows software were on average 50% faster than their pirated counterparts. The group concluded by stating that users of genuine Microsoft products ultimately receive superior performance while counterfeit users are susceptible to security issues and lost productivity. Fully Licensed GmbH, a developer of digital rights management technology, while criticizing Microsoft for being <b>vague</b> <b>about</b> the nature of information sent from a given computer during activation, nevertheless concluded that activation is not particularly intrusive and does not significantly violate privacy.|$|E
25|$|Four {{months after}} Poirot's death, Hastings {{receives}} a manuscript in which Poirot explains all. X was Norton, {{a man who}} had perfected the technique of which Iago in Othello (and a character in Ervine's play) is master: applying just such psychological pressure as is needed to provoke someone to commit murder, without his victim realising what is happening. Norton had demonstrated this ability, with Colonel Luttrell, with Hastings, and Mrs Franklin. Poirot intervened with sleeping pills in Hastings' hot chocolate that night, to avert a disastrous rash action. Ironically, Hastings had unwittingly intervened in Mrs. Franklin's plan to poison her husband, by turning a revolving bookcase table while seeking a book to solve a crossword clue (Othello again), thus swapping the cups of coffee, so Mrs Franklin poisoned herself. Poirot could not prove this. He sensed that Norton, who had been deliberately <b>vague</b> <b>about</b> whom he had seen through the binoculars, would hint that he had seen Franklin and Judith, to implicate them in the murder of Mrs Franklin, not inadvertent suicide as it was. This explains Poirot's testimony at her inquest, to ensure the police would stop their investigation.|$|E
25|$|In September 1990 Chrétien {{seeing a}} chance to make a strong {{impression}} on public opinion after a shaky start as a leader reaped a major windfall after Mulroney introduced an unpopular Goods and Services Tax (GST), which Chrétien decided to vigorously oppose. Traditionally in Canada the government had levied a 13.5% Manufacturer's Sales Tax (MST), which was paid by manufacturers, who passed on the cost of the tax to consumers in the form of higher prices. Since foreign manufacturers did not pay the MST, this placed Canadian companies at a competitive disadvantage in their home market, and to compensate the government had levied tariffs on manufactured imports to maintain a level playing field. When the free trade agreement with the United States came into effect in 1989, the government could no longer levy tariffs on American imports, which led to furious complaints from Canadian industry about having to compete with American companies who did not pay the MST. To save Canadian industry and the jobs of those Canadians employed in manufacturing from being destroyed by American competition, the Mulroney government decided in late 1989 to abolish the MST and replace it with the 7% GST, whose costs would be borne by consumers. On the proposed GST, Chrétien was torn between his belief that the GST was economically necessary vs. his desire to score political points by opposing a proposed tax that most Canadians hated, and as such, he was initially <b>vague</b> <b>about</b> where he stood about the GST. It was only in September 1990 after months of vacillation did Chrétien finally make up his mind to oppose the GST.|$|E
6000|$|Lady Bracknell. In the carriage, Gwendolen! [Gwendolen {{goes to the}} door. She and Jack blow kisses to {{each other}} behind Lady Bracknell's back.

6000|$|I {{wanted to}} say {{something}} exculpatory but I scarcely knew what note to strike. I could only look <b>vaguely</b> <b>about</b> me at the starry darkness and the sea that seemed to sleep. 'Well, with these splendid nights, this perfection of weather, people are beguiled into late hours.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Something has happened. I {{will tell}} you what it is some day perhaps, but not now. Something that realizes a romantic dream of mine. The dream has been {{hovering}} <b>vaguely</b> <b>about</b> me for nearly two years; but I never ventured to teach myself exactly what it was until to-day." ...|$|R
500|$|O'Reilly was {{strongly}} aggrieved by {{the removal of}} his long-time bowling partner, and maintained {{that it was an}} [...] "unpardonable" [...] error that heavily weakened Australia's bowling attack. However, he remained <b>vague</b> <b>about</b> why he thought Grimmett had been removed, even though suspicion dogged Bradman. Grimmett continued to dominate the wicket-taking on domestic cricket, while his replacements struggled in the international arena.|$|E
500|$|Some {{effects in}} the episode were created in Robert Legato's {{basement}} with water reflections and Christmas tree lights. The script was <b>vague</b> <b>about</b> what was seen {{at the end of}} the universe, so Legato played with the effects of water reflections on his basement wall. Shooting through BoPET film, he created multiple images which were layered over one another for the final effect (which Legato described as [...] "peculiar and bizarre"). Christmas tree lights were suspended and moved, to create the blinking effect seen on screen.|$|E
500|$|After Barrett died, {{his sister}} Rosemary insisted that Barrett neither {{suffered}} from mental illness nor received treatment {{for it at}} any time since they resumed regular contact in the 1980s. She allowed that he did spend some time in a private [...] "home for lost souls"—Greenwoods in Essex—but claimed there was no formal therapy programme there. Some years later, Barrett apparently agreed to sessions with a psychiatrist at Fulbourn psychiatric hospital in Cambridge, but Breen claimed that neither medication nor therapy was considered appropriate. His sister denied he was a recluse or that he was <b>vague</b> <b>about</b> his past: ...|$|E
6000|$|Owen, {{as if in}} {{quest of}} his umbrella, looked <b>vaguely</b> <b>about</b> the hall--looked even wistfully up the staircase--while the neat young woman {{complied}} with Fleda's request. Owen's eyes then wandered out of the open door. [...] "I think it's awfully nice here," [...] he observed; [...] "I assure you I could do with it myself." ...|$|R

60|$|Again, it {{is a point}} {{worth noting}} that {{a great many of}} the very big animals which people have in their minds when they talk <b>vaguely</b> <b>about</b> {{everything}} having been so very much bigger 'in those days' have become extinct within a very late period, and are often, from the geological point of view, quite recent.|$|R
500|$|The engine overhaul, and the {{replacement}} of a damaged topmast, delayed the party in Rio for four weeks. This meant {{that it was no}} longer practical to proceed to Cape Town and then on to the ice. Shackleton decided to sail directly to Grytviken harbour in South Georgia. Equipment and stores that had been sent on to Cape Town would have to be sacrificed, but Shackleton hoped that this shortfall could be made up in South Georgia. He was <b>vague</b> <b>about</b> the direction the expedition should take after South Georgia; Macklin wrote in his diary, [...] "The Boss says...quite frankly that he does not know what he will do." ...|$|E
500|$|Independent scholar John Griswold {{constructed}} a [...] "high-level chronology of James Bond's life", {{based on the}} logic of depicted events and actual time periods {{referred to in the}} books. This chronology differs from the publication sequence. Griswold also deliberately discounts the chronological significance of actual historic events mentioned in the novels and stories, arguing that Fleming made such references for effect without synchronising them accurately to his fiction. Fellow Bond-scholar Henry Chancellor also worked through the Bond chronology, which broadly agrees with Griswold, although there are differences. Chancellor noted that [...] "Fleming was always <b>vague</b> <b>about</b> dates", although the novels are supposed to be set in order of publication.|$|E
500|$|Brian G. Marsden, {{head of the}} MPC at Harvard who had {{supported}} Brown on previous naming disputes, again supported Brown, saying that [...] "Sooner or later, posterity will realise what happened, and Mike Brown will get the full credit". He went on to state, {{in reference to the}} name of the discoverer, which was left blank in the IAU listing, that [...] "It's deliberately <b>vague</b> <b>about</b> the discoverer of the object [...] We don't want to cause an international incident." [...] He called the whole controversy the worst since the early 17th-century dispute over who found the four biggest satellites of Jupiter between Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius, ultimately won by Galileo.|$|E
6000|$|Mademoiselle Noemie {{turned away}} a moment, {{walked to the}} other side of the hall, and stood there, looking <b>vaguely</b> <b>about</b> her. At last she came back.

60|$|Casimer {{was not in}} the room, {{the major}} and Mrs. Cumberland were sipping tea side by side, and the professors roaming <b>vaguely</b> <b>about.</b> To leave Amy in peace, Helen engaged them both in a lively chat, and her cousin sat by the window trying to collect her thoughts. Some one was pacing up and down the garden, hatless, in the dew.|$|R
6000|$|... "On condition"--Godfrey scarce blinked--"she {{never comes}} near me. She has solemnly promised, and she'll {{probably}} {{leave me alone}} to get the money. If she doesn't--in diplomacy--I'm lost." [...] He had been turning his eyes <b>vaguely</b> <b>about,</b> this way and that, to avoid meeting hers; but after another instant he gave up the effort {{and she had the}} miserable confession of his glance. [...] "I've been living in hell." ...|$|R
500|$|At the 2014 Brit Awards on 19 February, Bowie {{became the}} oldest {{recipient}} of a Brit Award in the ceremony's history {{when he won the}} award for Best British Male, which was collected on his behalf by Kate Moss. His speech read: [...] "I'm completely delighted to have a Brit for being the best male – but I am, aren't I Kate? Yes. I think it's a great way to end the day. Thank you very, very much and Scotland stay with us." [...] Bowie's reference to the forthcoming September 2014 Scottish independence referendum garnered a significant reaction throughout the UK on social media. On 18 July, Bowie indicated that future music would be forthcoming, though he was <b>vague</b> <b>about</b> details.|$|E
500|$|... "Indian Camp" [...] is {{also about}} the fear of death. The section cut from the story {{highlights}} Nick's fear; the published version underscores it in a less obvious manner. In the cut section, later published as [...] "Three Shots", the night before being taken to the Indian camp Nick is left alone in the forest, where he is [...] "overwhelmed by thoughts of death". Critic Paul Strong speculates that Hemingway may have intended the narrative to be structured so that Nick's father chose to take his fearful son to the Indian camp where Nick faced the grisly reality of death, which can have done [...] "little to assuage Nick's fears." [...] Hannum believes Hemingway is intentionally <b>vague</b> <b>about</b> {{the details of the}} birth but not the death; he speculates that Nick would have likely [...] "blocked out much of the caesarian but he had clearly seen the father's head tilted back".|$|E
500|$|In the {{literature}} concerning artificial intelligence, Searle's essay has been {{second only to}} Turing's in the volume of debate it has generated. [...] Searle himself was <b>vague</b> <b>about</b> what extra ingredients {{it would take to}} make a machine conscious: all he proposed was that what was needed was [...] "causal powers" [...] of the sort that the brain has and that computers lack. But other thinkers sympathetic to his basic argument have suggested that the necessary (though perhaps still not sufficient) extra conditions may include the ability to pass not just the verbal version of the Turing test, but the robotic version, which requires grounding the robot's words in the robot's sensorimotor capacity to categorize and interact with the things in the world that its words are about, Turing-indistinguishably from a real person. Turing-scale robotics is an empirical branch of research on embodied cognition and situated cognition.|$|E
50|$|Spitznagel “gained {{credibility}} in the investment world by predicting two market routs in the past decade, first in 2000 and then in 2008,” as well as predicting the “2000s commodities boom.” Despite his reputation as “one of Wall Street’s most bearish” as well as “biggest and boldest investors,” Spitznagel has remained a very secretive hedge fund manager, writing or speaking only very <b>vaguely</b> <b>about</b> his investing and always deflecting questions about the particulars of his positions and funds.|$|R
60|$|The fancy {{seemed to}} tickle him mightily, for he laughed blithely, {{and so did}} I; which, no doubt, caused the new nurse to be {{regarded}} as a light-minded sinner by the Chaplain, who roamed <b>vaguely</b> <b>about,</b> informing the men that they were all worms, corrupt of heart, with perishable bodies, and souls only to be saved by a diligent perusal of certain tracts, and other equally cheering bits of spiritual consolation, when spirituous ditto would have been preferred.|$|R
