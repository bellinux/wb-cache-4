5|$|A few ASD {{cases have}} been linked to {{exposure}} to teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) during the first eight weeks from conception. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> development. Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E

5|$|A line of rats with {{hereditary}} kidney cancer {{were developed}} by Japanese researchers. They have a mutation in the FLCN homolog that produces a truncated protein, though they do not develop the cutaneous or pulmonary symptoms seen in humans. Heterozygotes have renal abnormalities seen <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> life that develop into clear cell and hybrid tumors, significantly shortening the animals' lifespan; they also are prone to endometrial and salivary gland clear cell hyperplasia as well as rhabdomyolysis. Homozygotes do not survive to birth. When a wild-type FLCN gene was added, the phenotype was rescued.|$|E
5|$|Aliens do not {{feature in}} the series, as Grant and Naylor decided <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the process {{that they did not}} want aliens involved. This is usually {{addressed}} with Rimmer's belief in extraterrestrial life being shot down, such as a vessel he believes to be an alien ship turning out to be a garbage pod. However, there are non-human life forms such as evolutions of Earth species (e.g. the Cat race), robotic or holo-life forms created by humans, and a kind of 'Genetically Engineered Life Form' (GELF), an artificially-created creature. Simulants and GELFs frequently serve as antagonists among the later series of the show.|$|E

5|$|In the United States it was {{imported}} <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the 18th {{century and}} cultivated for its medicinal and piscicide properties.

It is now found commonly in all the states. In Canada, it is most common in the Maritime Provinces as well as southern Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, with scattered populations in between.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{during the}} fasting month of Ramadan, the Musaher {{of a town}} would yell and beat his drum to wake up the town's {{residents}} for suhoor (lit. 'of dawn')—usually <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the morning, ranging from 4-6 am. The meals eaten during this time are light and foods include labaneh, cheese, bread and fried or boiled eggs along with various liquids to drink. The muezzin's call to dawn prayers signaled the beginning of sawm or fasting.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bands of}} the NWOBHM {{had the same}} look as their fans and {{produced}} rock shows without special visual effects. A notable exception was Iron Maiden, which created the grisly character Eddie the Head as a stage prop to enrich their performances <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> their career. Other exceptions were Demon, Cloven Hoof and Samson, which used various props, costumes and tricks in their shows, while Pagan Altar and Venom became well known for their elaborate scenography inspired by shock rock and Satanism.|$|E

5|$|Temnospondyls {{and other}} early {{tetrapods}} have rounded otic notches {{in the back}} of the skull that project into the cheek region. In life, the otic notch would have been covered by a membrane called the tympanum, which is seen as a disk-like area in living frogs. The tympanum is involved in hearing, and is similar to the ear drum of more advanced tetrapods. It was traditionally thought that the tympanum developed <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> tetrapod evolution as a hearing organ and progressed to form the ear drum of amniotes. Thus, temnospondyls possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles arrived <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> {{the morning}} of 17 August 1960, but had no trouble finding the St. Pauli area of Hamburg, as it was so infamous. Unfortunately the Indra Club (64 Grosse Freiheit) was closed, so a manager from a {{neighbouring}} club found someone to open it up, and the group slept on the red leather seats in the alcoves. The group played at the club on the same night, but were told they could sleep in a small cinema's storeroom, which was cold and in very poor condition, the Bambi Kino (33 Paul-Roosen Strasse).|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble {{assumption is}} {{also consistent with}} the accidental production of arterial bubbles. One scenario considers a shunt at the heart or lung level that passes bubbles from the venous to the arterial side. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is thought to only open in certain conditions. A PFO conveniently explains neurological accidents after recreational air diving without any procedure violation, but it does not explain vestibular hits in deep diving. Vestibular symptoms can appear <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the decompression, long before the massive bubble production required to overload the system.|$|E

5|$|The {{recognition}} of pneumatic foramina in Majungasaurus, besides providing {{an understanding of}} its respiratory biology, also has larger-scale implications for evolutionary biology. The split between the ceratosaur line, which led to Majungasaurus, and the tetanuran line, to which birds belong, occurred <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the history of theropods. The avian respiratory system, present in both lines, must therefore have evolved before the split, and well before the evolution of birds themselves. This provides {{further evidence of the}} dinosaurian origin of birds.|$|E
5|$|Cerium is {{the second}} element of the {{lanthanide}} series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides lanthanum to its left and praseodymium to its right, and above the actinide thorium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness {{similar to that of}} silver. Its 58 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4f15d16s2, of which the four outer electrons are valence electrons. Immediately after lanthanum, the 4f orbitals suddenly contract and are lowered in energy {{to the point that they}} participate readily in chemical reactions; however, this effect is not yet strong enough at cerium and thus the 5d subshell is still occupied. Most lanthanides can use only three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: cerium is an exception because of the stability of the empty f-shell in Ce4+ and the fact that it comes <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough until neodymium to allow the removal of the fourth valence electron.|$|E
5|$|Industry {{appeared}} <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> Sélestat. The {{town had}} already several factories {{at the beginning}} of the 19th century: a tilery, a sawmill, 12 tanneries and 11 mills. Sélestat quickly became specialised in wire gauze making but it never became a large industrial centre, remaining a small town with limited influence. The completion of the Strasbourg-Basel railway (1840), one of the first to be built in France, did not lead to significant urban development. The town walls that still encircled the town were a significant factor in its economic and demographic stagnation. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Alsace and a part of Lorraine were annexed by the new German Empire. The German authorities demolished the city walls in 1874 and built new spacious neighbourhoods around the old town, as they did in Strasbourg and Metz.|$|E

50|$|Currently, only fossils {{representing}} <b>very</b> <b>early</b> stages <b>in</b> embryonic {{development have}} been preserved - no embryos have been interpreted as having undergone {{a large number}} cleavage stages.|$|R
5|$|Like most lanthanides, {{praseodymium}} {{usually only}} uses three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: {{this is because}} the 4f orbitals penetrate the most through the inert xenon core of electrons to the nucleus, followed by 5d and 6s, and this increases with higher ionic charge. Praseodymium nevertheless can continue losing a fourth and even occasionally a fifth valence electron because it comes <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough and the 4f subshell energy high enough to allow the removal of further valence electrons. Thus, similarly to the other early trivalent lanthanides, praseodymium has a double hexagonal close-packed crystal structure at room temperature. At about 560°C, it transitions to a face-centered cubic structure, and a body-centered cubic structure appears shortly before the melting point of 935°C.|$|E
5|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the Nike-X system was MAR, using the then-new {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) concept to allow it to generate multiple virtual radar beams, simulating any number of mechanical radars needed. While one beam scanned the sky for new targets, others were formed to examine the threat tubes and generate high-quality tracking information <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the engagement. More beams were formed to track the RVs once picked out, and still more to track the Sprints {{on their way to the}} interceptions. To make all of this work, MAR required data processing capabilities on an unprecedented level, so Bell proposed building the system using the newly invented resistor–transistor logic small-scale integrated circuits. Nike-X centralized the battle control systems at their Defense Centers, consisting of a MAR and its associated underground Defense Center Data Processing System (DCDPS).|$|E
5|$|The number 1,207 appears <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the {{historical}} record (472 BC), and the Greeks appear to have genuinely believed they faced that many ships. Because of the consistency in the ancient sources, some modern historians are inclined to accept 1,207 as {{the size of the}} initial Persian fleet; others reject this number, with 1,207 being seen as more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad, and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean. However, very few appear to accept that there were this many ships at Salamis: most favour a number in the range 600-800. This is also the range given by adding the approximate number of Persian ships after Artemisium (~550) to the reinforcements (120) quantified by Herodotus.|$|E
