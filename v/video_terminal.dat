5|$|The Altair 8800 {{was modeled}} after early 1970s {{minicomputers}} {{such as the}} Data General Nova. These machines contained a CPU board, memory boards, and I/O boards; the data storage and display terminal were external devices. The Teletype Model 33 ASR was a popular terminal because it provided printed output and data storage on punched paper tape. More advanced systems would have 8-inch floppy disks and a <b>video</b> <b>terminal</b> that would display 24 lines of 80 characters such as the ADM-3A. (No graphics were available and lower-case letters were a $75 option.) Most of these computers had a front panel with toggle switches for entering data and lights for displaying it. These were normally used to boot the computer and to diagnose problems.|$|E
25|$|The Console Command Processor, or CCP, {{accepted}} {{input from}} the keyboard and conveyed results to the terminal. CP/M itself would work with either a printing terminal or a <b>video</b> <b>terminal.</b> All CP/M commands had to be typed in on the command line. The console would most often display the A> prompt, to indicate the current default disk drive. When used with a <b>video</b> <b>terminal,</b> this would usually {{be followed by a}} blinking cursor supplied by the terminal. The CCP would await {{input from the}} user.|$|E

30|$|It {{should be}} noted here that, {{although}} generally Di(s) refers to the estimation made by the NCC of each <b>video</b> <b>terminal’s</b> upcoming bandwidth requirements, it also refers, every 11 frames, to the “corrective” request sent by the <b>video</b> <b>terminals</b> every superframe. With the use of Eq. (7) for bandwidth allocation, our protocol also guarantees that, {{in the case of}} traffic overload, all users experience equal video packet dropping probability.|$|R

50|$|Eventually, in July 2007, slot {{machines}} were banned in Norway. In 2009 IVTs (interactive <b>video</b> <b>terminals)</b> were introduced. The players {{required to have}} a special card to play on them.|$|R

50|$|In 1976, LSI {{released}} ADM-3A, {{still one}} of the earliest computer <b>video</b> <b>terminals,</b> with a new industry low single unit price of $995. With no fast low-cost printers available, the ADM-3 became the de facto standard.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the environment, {{the screen}} buffer can be {{directly}} addressable. Programs that display output on remote <b>video</b> <b>terminals</b> must issue special control sequences to manipulate the screen buffer. The most popular standards for such control sequences are ANSI and VT100.|$|R
50|$|The Mentor 2000 ran at 5 MHz using a Zilog processor, 640 KB RAM, and {{included}} one 60MB hard disk. It used the Pick operating system and database management system. It {{was able to}} manage 16 or 32 <b>video</b> <b>terminals</b> at once.|$|R
50|$|Each ScanEagle {{system costs}} US$3.2 million (2006). A {{complete}} system comprises four air vehicles or AVs, a ground control station, remote <b>video</b> <b>terminal,</b> the SuperWedge launch system and Skyhook recovery system.|$|E

50|$|In 1976, Wozniak started {{attending}} {{meetings of}} the Homebrew Computer Club. New microcomputers such as the Altair 8800 and the IMSAI inspired him to build a microprocessor into his <b>video</b> <b>terminal</b> and have a complete computer.|$|E

50|$|A {{terminal}} emulator, terminal application, or term, is {{a program}} that emulates a <b>video</b> <b>terminal</b> within some other display architecture. Though typically synonymous with a shell or text terminal, the term terminal covers all remote terminals, including graphical interfaces. A terminal emulator inside a graphical user interface is often called a terminal window.|$|E
5000|$|As {{described}} above, printers commonly required fill characters {{when the}} carriage {{was returned to}} the left margin. With other equipment, fill characters were occasionally required in other circumstances. For example the VT05 <b>video</b> <b>terminal</b> sometimes required fill characters when a [...] "scroll up" [...] operation was performed; the process of shuffling data in the shift register memory of the VT05 was slow.|$|E
50|$|PolyMorphic Systems' first {{products}} were several interface boards {{based on the}} then-popular S-100 bus. These were compatible with other microcomputers such as the Altair 8800 and IMSAI 8080. The first was an A/D and D/A converter board. This {{was followed by a}} <b>video</b> <b>terminal</b> interface (VTI) card which became the primary display device for their systems. Later board-level products included CPU, RAM, and disk controller cards.|$|E

50|$|Christian Wirth (born in the 1970s), {{better known}} by the {{pseudonym}} RaD Man, is an American computer artist and historian. He works {{in the field of}} ANSI art, a method of creating art using a limited set of text characters and color escape codes based loosely on the relevant ANSI standard (X3.64: Control Sequences for <b>Video</b> <b>Terminals</b> and Peripherals).|$|R
50|$|The VT100 is a <b>video</b> <b>terminal,</b> {{introduced}} in August 1978 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). It {{was one of}} the first terminals to support ANSI escape codes for cursor control and other tasks, and added a number of extended codes for special features like controlling the status lights on the keyboard. This led to rapid uptake of the ANSI standard, becoming the de facto standard for terminal emulators.|$|E
50|$|Users {{generally}} operated RT-11 via {{a printing}} terminal or a <b>video</b> <b>terminal,</b> originally via a strap-selectable current-loop (for conventional teletypes) or RS-232 (later RS-422 as well) interface {{on one of}} the CPU cards; DEC also supported the VT11 and VS60 graphics display devices (vector graphics terminals with a graphic character generator for displaying text, and a light pen for graphical input). A third-party favorite was the Tektronix 4010 family.|$|E
50|$|The 8085 had a {{long life}} as a controller, no doubt thanks to its {{built-in}} serial I/O and 5 prioritized interrupts, arguably microcontroller-like features that the Z80 CPU did not have. Once designed into such products as the DECtape controller and the VT102 <b>video</b> <b>terminal</b> in the late 1970s, the 8085 served for new production throughout the lifetime of those products. This was typically longer than the product life of desktop computers.|$|E
50|$|In {{operating}} systems, {{the term}} terminal host traditionally denotes a multi-user computer or software {{providing services to}} computer terminals, or a computer that provides services to smaller or less capable devices, such as a mainframe computer serving teletype <b>terminals</b> or <b>video</b> <b>terminals.</b> Other examples are a telnet host (a telnet server) and an xhost (X Window client).|$|R
