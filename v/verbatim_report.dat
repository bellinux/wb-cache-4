Appointed medical registrar to the London Hospital in 1896 and elected assistant physician four years later, there is a <b>verbatim</b> <b>report</b> {{of one of his}} rounds in 1900.

In the absence of a <b>verbatim</b> <b>report</b> differing perceptions are difficult to judge fairly; Huxley wrote a detailed account for Darwin, a letter which does not survive; however, a letter to his friend Frederick Daniel Dyster does survive with an account just three months after the event.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{shows that}} {{many forms of}} {{communication}} which are generally conceived as originals are in fact mediated in various ways and are hybrid in nature. EU parliamentary reports are a case in point. The original oral ST, which is hybrid {{in that it is}} multilingual, is simultaneously interpreted - and thus mediated and recontextualized - by means of a series of relay translations. Speeches delivered in English by non-native speakers are also recontextualized in various ways, which are examined in the paper through a qualitative methodology consisting in the comparison of the <b>verbatim</b> <b>reports</b> and the actual transcription of non-native speakers interventions from the audio-recording of the sitting held on 3 April 2006, the first video-recording available on the EU Parliament website. Findings show that the English of the original oral text is brought to the centre of the written-spoken continuum, thus emphasizing the ideational dimension rather than the interactional one; the language in <b>verbatim</b> <b>reports</b> is made more explicit for the non-participants in the original communicative event and address forms to EU fellow members are normalized. Therefore, in the intralingual mediation process through which the original non-native EU parliamentary discourse is recontextualized in <b>verbatim</b> <b>reports,</b> the translation universal strategies identified by Baker (1996) are clearly recognizable. Such strategies may thus be considered as more general mediation strategies, which are at work not only in translation, but also in intralingual mediatio...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} formal and {{functional}} dimensions of reported discourse in sixteenth-century correspondence. It focuses on how letter-writers report the utterances – spoken, thought and written – of high-status sources (namely, the king or queen), {{in order to}} assess how the early modern reporting system compares with the present-day equivalent. The early modern values of authenticity, <b>verbatim</b> <b>reporting</b> and verbal authority are examined. The results taken from the Parsed Corpus of Early English Correspondence (PCEEC) suggest that early modern writers prefer to present royal language using indirect reports with semi-conventionalised linguistic features that clearly mark the authority of the source. Only an elite few, associated with the Court, use direct speech. The paper suggests that reporting practices distinguish between speech and writing, with the latter showing nascent signs of anxiety over <b>verbatim</b> <b>reporting.</b> I argue that these trends arise from the larger cultural shift from oral to written records taking place throughout the early modern period.

Also it contained a goodly sprinkling of sarcasms and grumblings at his, Morris's, bad management of various little matters which the Colonel considered important. Most of all, however, was his parent indignant at his neglect to furnish him with details sufficiently ample of {{the progress of the}} new buildings. Lastly, he desired, by return of post, a <b>verbatim</b> <b>report</b> of the quarrel that, as he was informed, had occurred on the school board when a prominent Roman Catholic threatened to throw an inkstand at a dissenting minister who, coram populo, called him the son of [...] "a Babylonian woman." ...|$|E
6000|$|The July which {{immediately}} succeeded {{my marriage}} was made memorable by three cases of interest, in which I {{had the privilege}} of being associated with Sherlock Holmes and of studying his methods. I find them recorded in my notes under the headings of [...] "The Adventure of the Second Stain," [...] "The Adventure of the Naval Treaty," [...] and [...] "The Adventure of the Tired Captain." [...] The first of these, however, deals with interest of such importance and implicates so many of the first families in the kingdom that for many years it will be impossible to make it public. No case, however, in which Holmes was engaged has ever illustrated the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply. I still retain an almost <b>verbatim</b> <b>report</b> of the interview in which he demonstrated the true facts of the case to Monsieur Dubugue of the Paris police, and Fritz von Waldbaum, the well-known specialist of Dantzig, both of whom had wasted their energies upon what proved to be side-issues.

Although The Veterinarian, founded 1828, and The Veterinary Journal, founded 1844, were well established and covered some of the same ground as Hunting's new journal, the fact that Veterinary Record was published every week and carried <b>verbatim</b> <b>reports</b> of council and local association meetings gave it an immediacy that the other publications could not match.|$|R
6000|$|The six {{stories in}} this volume {{are the result of}} some three or four years of {{occasional}} work. The dates of their writing are far apart, their origins are various. None of them are connected directly with personal experiences. In all of them the facts are inherently true, by which I mean that they are not only possible but that they have actually happened. For instance, the last story in the volume the one I call Pathetic, whose first title is Il Conde (mis-spelt by-the-by) is an almost verbatim transcript of the tale told me by a very charming old gentleman whom I met in Italy. I don't mean to say it is only that. Anybody can see that it is something more than a <b>verbatim</b> <b>report,</b> but where he left off and where I began must be left to the acute discrimination of the reader who may be interested in the problem. I don't mean to say that the problem is worth the trouble. What I am certain of, however, {{is that it is not}} to be solved, for I am not at all clear about it myself by this time. All I can say is that the personality of the narrator was extremely suggestive quite apart from the story he was telling me. I heard a few years ago that he had died far away from his beloved Naples where that [...] "abominable adventure" [...] did really happen to him.|$|E
6000|$|The {{occasions}} {{which brought}} us to New York together were not nearly so frequent as those which united us in Boston, {{but there was a}} dinner given him by a friend which remains memorable from the fatuity of two men present, so different in everything but their fatuity. One was the sweet old comedian Billy Florence, who was urging the unsuccessful dramatist across the table to write him a play about Oliver Cromwell, and giving the reasons why he thought himself peculiarly fitted to portray the character of Cromwell. The other was a modestly millioned rich man who was then only beginning to amass the moneys afterward heaped so high, and was still in the condition to be flattered by the condescension of a yet greater millionaire. His contribution to our gaiety was the <b>verbatim</b> <b>report</b> of a call he had made upon William H. Vanderbilt, whom he had found just about starting out of town, with his trunks actually in the front hall, but who had stayed to receive the narrator. He had, in fact, sat down on one of the trunks, and talked with the easiest friendliness, and quite, we were given to infer, like an ordinary human being. Clemens often kept on with some thread of the talk when we came away from a dinner, but now he was silent, as if [...] "high sorrowful and cloyed"; and it was not till well afterward that I found he had noted the facts from the bitterness with which he mocked the rich man, and the pity he expressed for the actor.|$|E
