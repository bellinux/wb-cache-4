5000|$|Videoface Digitiser is a <b>video</b> <b>digitiser</b> {{interface}} for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum home computer. It {{was produced}} by Data-Skip from The Netherlands and later on Romantic Robot from UK in 1987. It was originally sold for GBP 69, but the price dropped to 30 GBP within few years.|$|E
40|$|In June 2000, the Surrey Space Centre (SSC) and Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) {{launched}} the remote inspection demonstrator nanosatellite, 2 ̆ 2 SNAP- 12 ̆ 2. One {{of the primary}} mission objectives of this satellite was to image its companion microsatellite, Tsinghua- 1, during the deployment phase of the launch. Later in the mission it is also planned that SNAP- 1 will be manoeuvred back within visual range of Tsinghua- 1, in order to carry out further imaging experiments whilst the satellites fly in formation. To fulfill its mission, SNAP- 1 carries a powerful, innovative and highly integrated Machine Vision System (MVS). This consists of four ulta-minature CMOS video cameras, a 2 ̆ 2 software 2 ̆ 2 <b>video</b> <b>digitiser,</b> 8 Mb of 70 ns SRAM and a 220 MHz StrongARM processor. The integration of these components provides a low cost, low power consumption, high reliability platform, with enough processing power to capture and process real-time video images. This will enable SNAP- 1 to not only compress and return images back to Earth, but to perform high level computer vision functions such as optical target tracking, automatic pose and position estimation and on future SNAP missions perhaps even optically guided docking. This paper therefore details the design, performance and initial results from the SNAP- 1 Machine Vision System...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the way words and {{pictures}} work together in cognitive development and {{the place of the}} computer as a tool to enhance and extend such development by assisting in creating the content of a publication, providing the means to revise and tailor information to specific audiences, generate the images, merge text and graphics, make a proof for editing and finally reproduce the completed publication for a wider audience. It describes such a research project and analyses the results achieved. There is an overview of general psychological writings and theses on imagery and perception in chapter two. Art packages and the use of camcorder and <b>video</b> <b>digitiser</b> are discussed as are strategies for computing and presenting images. The nature of the writing process, writing for publication to an unknown audience and the part played by the word processor in such a project are discussed in chapter three. The research study is described in chapter four, its organisation, the basic computer system required and the various decisions which needed to be made and the skills required and developed by the children involved are studied. In chapter five the findings of the project, the developing child writer, the observed changes in behaviour, the computer as a new medium for art are summarised. The test results are quantified and there is a look at some aspects of certain individual texts. In the concluding chapter the speaking, writing, reading relationship, pupil-initiated learning, the impact of word processing, the role of the teacher and the possible requirements of the National Curriculum are discussed and suggestions for further work are outlined...|$|E
50|$|Utility {{software}} {{was available to}} drive hardware add-ons such as <b>video</b> <b>digitisers.</b> Office Productivity and graphics {{software was}} also bundled with the ST (HyperPaint II by Dimitri Koveos, HyperDraw by David Farmborough, 3D-Calc spreadsheet by Frank Schoonjans, and several others commissioned by Bob Katz, later of Electronic Arts).|$|R
50|$|Future Tactics: The Uprising is a turn based {{tactical}} shooter {{video game}} by Zed Two. Once known as Pillage, this colourful turn based shooter {{was stuck in}} development {{for a number of}} years before being picked up by Crave for a US release, followed shortly by JoWood for a European release. It plays a lot like the Worms 3D games and has a story penned by Paul Rose, who used to write the <b>video</b> game page <b>Digitiser</b> on Channel 4's Teletext. The game features a geo-mod system in which almost anything can be destroyed, leaving battlefields scarred by craters.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Biffo, {{real name}} Paul Rose, is a UK screenwriter. He was {{the editor of}} the Teletext-based <b>video</b> games {{magazine}} <b>Digitiser,</b> which ran between 1993 and 2003. He is the co-creator of the CBBC children's sitcom Dani's House, on which he is also lead writer. He is also the co-creator and lead writer of CBBC's 4 O'Clock Club, the follow-up to Dani's House entitled Dani's Castle, and the screenwriter of Pudsey: The Movie, starring the Britain's Got Talent winner (a dog, voiced for the movie by David Walliams). In addition, he is writing for the fourth series of Stella.|$|R
