5|$|A third, more {{graphical}} way {{of describing}} a 2-satisfiability instance is as an implication graph. An implication graph is a directed graph {{in which there}} is one vertex per variable or negated variable, and an edge connecting one vertex to another whenever the corresponding variables are related by an implication in the implicative normal form of the instance. An implication graph must be a skew-symmetric graph, meaning that it has a symmetry that takes each <b>variable</b> <b>to</b> its negation and reverses the orientations of all of the edges.|$|E
5|$|The set of all {{solutions}} to a 2-satisfiability instance has {{the structure of}} a median graph, in which an edge corresponds to the operation of flipping the values of a set of variables that are all constrained to be equal or unequal to each other. In particular, by following edges in this way one can get from any solution to any other solution. Conversely, any median graph can be represented as the set of {{solutions to}} a 2-satisfiability instance in this way. The median of any three solutions is formed by setting each <b>variable</b> <b>to</b> the value it holds in the majority of the three solutions. This median always forms another solution to the instance.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{interpretations of}} the crest's {{function}} began in 1910, when George Francis Eaton proposed two possibilities: an aerodynamic counterbalance and a muscle attachment point. He suggested that the crest might have anchored large, long jaw muscles, but admitted that this function alone could not explain the large size of some crests. Bennett (1992) agreed with Eaton's own assessment that the crest was too large and <b>variable</b> <b>to</b> have been a muscle attachment site. Eaton had suggested that a secondary function of the crest might have been as a counterbalance against the long beak, reducing the need for heavy neck muscles to control {{the orientation of the}} head. Wind tunnel tests showed that the crest did function as an effective counterbalance to a degree, but Bennett noted that again, the hypothesis focuses only on the long crests of male P. longiceps, not on the larger crests of P. sternbergi and very small crests that existed among the females. Bennett found that the crests of females had no counterbalancing effect, and that the crests of male P. sternbergi would, by themselves, {{have a negative effect on}} the balance of the head. In fact, side to side movement of the crests would have required more, not less, neck musculature to control balance.|$|E

25|$|In {{probability}} theory, {{a probability}} density function (PDF), or density of a continuous random variable, is a function, whose value {{at any given}} sample (or point) in the sample space (the set of possible values taken by the random variable) {{can be interpreted as}} providing a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable would equal that sample. In other words, while the absolute likelihood for a continuous random <b>variable</b> <b>to</b> take on any particular value is 0 (since there are an infinite set of possible values to begin with), the value of the PDF at two different samples can be used to infer, in any particular draw of the random variable, how much more likely it is that the random variable would equal one sample compared to the other sample.|$|E

25|$|Obsidian is mineral-like, {{but not a}} true mineral {{because as}} a glass it is not crystalline; in addition, its {{composition}} is too <b>variable</b> <b>to</b> be classified as a mineral. It is sometimes classified as a mineraloid. Though obsidian is usually dark in color similar to mafic rocks such as basalt, obsidian's composition is extremely felsic. Obsidian consists mainly of SiO2 (silicon dioxide), usually 70% or more. Crystalline rocks with obsidian's composition include granite and rhyolite. Because obsidian is metastable at the Earth's surface (over time the glass becomes fine-grained mineral crystals), no obsidian {{has been found that}} is older than Cretaceous age. This breakdown of obsidian is accelerated by the presence of water. Having a low water content when newly formed, typically less than 1% water by weight, obsidian becomes progressively hydrated when exposed to groundwater, forming perlite.|$|E
25|$|Early {{evidence}} relating tobacco smoking to {{mortality and}} morbidity came from observational studies employing regression analysis. In {{order to reduce}} spurious correlations when analyzing observational data, researchers usually include several variables in their regression models {{in addition to the}} variable of primary interest. For example, suppose we have a regression model in which cigarette smoking is the independent variable of interest, and the dependent variable is lifespan measured in years. Researchers might include socio-economic status as an additional independent <b>variable,</b> <b>to</b> ensure that any observed effect of smoking on lifespan is not due to some effect of education or income. However, it is never possible to include all possible confounding variables in an empirical analysis. For example, a hypothetical gene might increase mortality and also cause people to smoke more. For this reason, randomized controlled trials are often able to generate more compelling evidence of causal relationships than can be obtained using regression analyses of observational data. When controlled experiments are not feasible, variants of regression analysis such as instrumental variables regression may be used to attempt to estimate causal relationships from observational data.|$|E
