A senior American general told us that adding U.S. troops might temporarily help limit violence in a highly localized area.

As another American general told us, if the Iraqi government does not make political progress, [...] "all the troops in the world will not provide security." [...] Meanwhile, America's military capacity is stretched thin: {{we do not have the}} troops or equipment to make a substantial, sustained increase in our troop presence.

40|$|Often {{justified}} {{in the name}} of religion, Islamist <b>violence</b> against women <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> is a prevalent and omnipresent concern. This thesis explores the escalating issues with regard to both physical and psychological or legally-sanctioned <b>violence</b> against women <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> exploring the reasons for its occurrence and working to deconstruct its religious rationalizations. The thesis also offers an analysis of the Islamic sources [...] the Qur'an, Sunna, and hadith [...] that relies on strategies such as linguistic and historical contextualization to demonstrate that Islam's intended view of women was actually quite progressive. Many more conservative Islamic interpretations or arguments in favor of female subservience are reliant on carefully chosen Qur'anic verses for legitimacy. Devoid of context and a thorough explanation of each Arabic term's array of potential meanings, these arguments fail to adequately portray Islam's progressive potential with regard to gender relations. Ultimately, the ensuing work seeks to make the policy recommendation that, at least with respect to Iraqi women, the key to liberation in the post-Saddam era is not through secular strategies or solutions, but instead, through non-secular arguments and interpretations, indeed through Islam itself...|$|R
