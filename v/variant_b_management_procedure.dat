40|$|Salinity {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} stresses that affect plant growth and agricultural production. Considerable efforts have therefore been made to investigate how plants respond to salt stress. To investigate the responses of Acanthophyllum to salinity stress, changes on lipid peroxidation, H 2 O 2 content and the activity of antioxidant enzymes in calli of two Acanthophyllum laxiusculum variants, without (variant A) and with (<b>variant</b> <b>B)</b> B-chromosomes, were analyzed. Under salinity stress, lipid peroxidation and H 2 O 2 content decreased in variant A compared to <b>variant</b> <b>B.</b> Moreover, <b>variant</b> A produced a higher amount of proline under salt stress than <b>variant</b> <b>B.</b> In calli of variant A, salinity stress preferentially enhanced the activities of the superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1. 15. 1. 1), catalase (CAT, EC 1. 11. 1. 6), ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1. 11. 1. 11) and glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1. 6. 4. 2), whereas it decreased their activity in <b>variant</b> <b>B.</b> Guaiacol peroxidase (GPX, EC 1. 11. 1. 7) activity decreased with increasing NaCl concentrations in variant A but its activity increased in <b>variant</b> <b>B.</b> After native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis, calli of both A and <b>B</b> <b>variants</b> had only Mn-SOD and Fe-SOD isoforms. Expression of the isoforms mentioned above, showed marked increase in variant A; while in <b>variant</b> <b>B</b> salinity caused a significant reduction as compared to control. Moreover, changes in the CAT and GPX isoforms pattern of treated plants were in accordance with the activity changes in time. These results suggest that variant A was able to induce better antioxidative responses against salt stress than <b>variant</b> <b>B...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to find the influence of different silage additives on the quality of fermentation process of ensiled high moisture crimped corn. Three variants were examined: untreated control (UC) variant in which was high moisture corn conserved without additives, and experimental <b>variants</b> A and <b>B.</b> In these <b>variants</b> different silage additives (bacterial inoculant in variant A and combined biochemical additive in <b>variant</b> <b>B)</b> were applied. After 6 months of silage fermentation process the average samples for the fermentation products content were determined. The highest lactic acid content was found in untreated control variant (24. 27 g/kg of dry matter). After the silage additives application lower acetic acid content was found (2. 87 in variant A and 2. 82 g/kg of dry matter in <b>variant</b> <b>B).</b> Undesirable butyric acid content was generally very low. The lowest value (significantly at P< 0. 01) of titration acidity was determined in <b>variant</b> <b>B.</b> The value of active acidity (pH) of water extracts of silages were from 3. 70 (<b>variant</b> <b>B)</b> to 3. 75 (variant UC), without statistical differences.

40|$|Management {{strategy}} evaluation (MSE) is {{a structured}} approach to designing fishery management {{systems that are}} likely to meet the objectives of stakeholders and managers. Management objectives are essential to the MSE process because they identify things that are important for a stock/fishery and they are used to evaluate and distinguish between alternative <b>management</b> <b>procedures.</b> A <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> maps the pathway from fisheries data to fisheries management actions, and it describes when management actions occur and what management actions occur in response to changes in a stock/fishery. A <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> includes three components: fishery monitoring data, the evaluation of the data (e. g., the stock assessment), and harvest decision rules or harvest control rules (HCR). A HCR sets catch or effort limits based on estimates of stock status. Reference points are control points that are used to determine which HCR is used based on stock status in a <b>management</b> <b>procedure.</b> <b>Management</b> <b>procedures</b> can be set up so that they are identical except for their reference points (thus they are alternative candidate procedures) and in this way the MSE process can be used to evaluate the performance of alternative candidate reference points, e. g., target reference points for north Pacific albacore as requested by NC 10.

40|$|Age related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is the leading}} cause of blindness among the elderly population. It occurs in two forms, a nonexudative "dry" form which can lead to geographic atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in the region of the macula and an exudative "wet" form which involves neovascularisation from the choroid, through Bruch's membrane and the RPE layer and into the photoreceptor layer causing significant damage. Cystatin C is a cysteine protease inhibitor known to inhibit cathepsin activity. It is a highly abundant transcript in the RPE and is known to be processed through the secretory pathway. A variant form of this protein with an amino acid substitution in its signal sequence results in the protein being retained intracellularly and is found localised with the mitochondria. This variant form has been associated with increased risk of developing exudative AMD. In this study a number of key cellular processes were examined to elucidate the effect the <b>variant</b> <b>B</b> protein has on the RPE. These processes were respiration, apoptosis, autophagy and oxidative stress; all of which have been implicated in AMD pathology or ageing. In addition the protein-protein interactions of <b>variant</b> <b>B</b> cystatin C were assessed through mass spectrometry analysis of pulled-down cystatin C protein from transfected cell lysates. No effect on respiration, apoptosis or autophagy was identified. However a statistically significant difference in oxidative stress was identified as a result of overexpression of either wild type cystatin C or <b>variant</b> <b>B</b> cystatin C. Mass spectrometry analysis resulted in two highly promising proteins that were found interacting with <b>variant</b> <b>B</b> cystatin C at a statistically significant level, prohibitin and voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC 1). Although oxidative stress was found for both proteins given the nature of the expression (driven by a CMV promoter) it seems likely that the oxidative stress response is due to a high level of intracellular cystatin C. This suggests that the retention of <b>variant</b> <b>B</b> protein within the cell would lead to increased oxidative stress levels. It can be speculated that this response could be a contributory factor to development of AMD. VDAC 1 and prohibitin may offer an explanation of what happens to the <b>variant</b> <b>B</b> protein within RPE cells. VDAC 1 is the major pore-forming protein in the mitochondrial membrane, disruption of its functioning by the binding of <b>variant</b> <b>B</b> protein might be expected to have detrimental effects. Prohibitin is an even more promising target as it has been associated with oxidative stress. In addition it is known to translocate between the nucleus and the mitochondria, offering the tantalising possibility of a complete explanation for the mitochondrial mislocalisation...|$|R
