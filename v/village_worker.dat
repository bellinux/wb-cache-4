50|$|The second {{category}} of Prof. Jha’s shorter fiction comprises beautiful transcriptions {{of life in}} such pieces as Panch Patra (Five Letters), Kanyak Jeevan (Life of a Girl Child), Maryadak Bhang (Loss of Grace), Gram Sevika (The Lady <b>Village</b> <b>Worker),</b> Graduate Putohu (The Graduate Daughter-in-law), and Railak Anubhav (Experience of a Train Journey). Artistically superior to the earlier group, these are the real gems of Prof. Jha’s stories, {{and some of them}} like Panch Patra and Kanyak Jeevan can compete with the best in world literature. In the earlier stories we invariably feel the presence of the author in the personal comments and the messages that are allowed to go overtly stated. That was quite in keeping with the social satire he was writing. But here we have snippets of life presented in total objectivity, with the bareness and conciseness of a Chekhovian story. The author withdraws himself and lets the story unfold itself. The message is there but it is artistically interwoven in the story.|$|E
50|$|The {{next three}} stories in this {{category}} namely, Maryadak Bhang, Gram Sevika and Graduate Potohu reveal Prof. Jha {{as a champion of}} the “new woman”. These stories present bold and emancipated young women taking charge of duties hitherto denied to them. Situations in these stories have been created in such a dexterous manner that old values become ridiculously redundant and the new ones assert themselves. In Maryadak Bhang, the daughter-in-law of a conservative Maithil family boldly defies the purdah and comes out to receive the guest thus saving the grace of the family from being lost, while elderly ladies of the house try to hide behind some cover. Gram Sevika {{is the story of a}} <b>village</b> <b>worker</b> who impresses the entire village by her selfless social service, and wins the heart of even those who were critical of her in the beginning. Graduate Putohu is about an educated woman of independent views who is coldly received in her husband’s family but her untimely death from snakebite brings about a radical change in their perspective of woman. In Railak Anubhav there is a juxtaposition of two contrary scenes - one highlighting linguistic affinity among the Bengalis and their exemplary love for mother-tongue, the other revealing an utter lack of these among Maithils. The story poses a relevant question and asks us to ponder why there is such a vast difference between Bengal and Mithila in spite of geographical proximity. Padma and Kamla connote the same thing, then why is there such a difference in their waters? All these stories have neatly crafted plots, and there is a total elimination of the personal element. They all have some intellectual element compelling us to think and improve the social situation. But the message is never made explicit but is artistically embedded in the plot of the story.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{has attempted to}} evaluate the function of <b>village</b> health <b>workers</b> in health promotion, prevention, and curative services provided for rural children under five years of age.;A survey was conducted to determine maternal knowledge of childhood infectious diseases and childhood immunization, and to compare the immunization status of children aged 6 - 23 months in villages with and without a <b>village</b> health <b>worker.</b> A cohort study was carried out to compare the medical care provided for diarrhea, fever, and cough to children aged 6 - 59 months in villages with and without a village health worker.;It was expected that the DPT immunization coverage (2 -doses) of children in villages with a <b>village</b> health <b>worker</b> would be 10 percentage points {{higher than that of}} children in villages without a <b>village</b> health <b>worker.</b> It was also expected that the medical care provided by the <b>village</b> health <b>worker</b> would not be substantially inferior to that provided by health centre personnel (i. e. the frequency of poor outcome of illness would not be more than 10 percentage points higher among the former).;A multivariate analysis showed that DPT immunization coverage in village with and without a <b>village</b> health <b>worker</b> was not statistically significantly different.

40|$|Village {{health workers}} {{are often the}} main vehicle for {{promoting}} the primary health care approach in developing countries. Services provided by these workers {{are expected to be}} more appropriate to the health needs of populations than those of clinic-based services, to be less expensive and to foster self-reliance and local participation. Because village workers are more accessible and acceptable to clients in their communities, they are expected to improve the overall coverage of services as well as equity [...] increased service use by poorer individuals and households. This paper presents research on coverage and equity from village health worker programs in Java, Indonesia. Rural health and nutrition projects in Java using village-level volunteers with limited training have grown since the early 1970 s to include large national programs managed by the government's rural health system. Volunteer village workers are now the most extensive link between the rural population and the formal health service structure. Previous research on coverage and equity of these <b>village</b> <b>worker</b> activities is reviewed and results from the author's own study are presented. Services provided by village health workers achieve significantly higher levels of population coverage than similar clinic-based services. In most cases, village workers show no bias towards better-off clients and they may favor poorer beneficiaries. These findings show that village workers are meeting the coverage and equity objectives of the primary health care approach. However, some of the research reviewed raises questions about the ability of <b>village</b> <b>worker</b> activities to maintain these results over a longer period. The rapid expansion of these programs requires continued research, not only on coverage and equity, but also on health outcomes, costs, and participation. ...|$|E
40|$|The built {{environment}} in Australia {{is responsible for}} around 40 percent of the nations’ greenhouse gases. Consequently carbon neutral buildings and precincts are areas of increasing interest to sustainability practitioners and researchers. This thesis focuses on mine site village development as a contribution to an Australian Research Council research project entitled “Decarbonising Cities and Regions. ” It dissects the many areas of carbon emissions attributable to the construction and operation of a typical mine site village, how this carbon footprint {{can be reduced to}} a point of carbon neutrality, and how the process could be applied to other built formats. The scientific literature was found to be essentially silent on the issue of sustainability and carbon footprint of this type of built form. Several research questions were posited regarding the carbon footprint: what are its constituents for a typical mine site village, how can it be calculated and substantially reduced or become ‘carbon neutral’? After deducting the effects of energy efficiencies and behaviour change programs what effect does the introduction of renewable energy have in both standalone and grid connected configurations? After all aforementioned reductions what proportion remains to be offset by the introduction of accredited offset purchases? A conceptual model was designed to delineate the components of the village’s carbon footprint. These were the carbon emissions from: embodied energy of the built form; energy required to operate the village; transport of supplies to the village; fly-in/fly-out access by employees of the mine; water supply and waste water treatment; food production, and; solid waste disposal. The model was applied to a mine site village in Western Australia. A life cycle analysis tool, eTool™, was used to determine the embodied energy of the built form and services infrastructure for village life spans of 5, 10, 15 and 20 years. A comprehensive on-site energy monitoring system was set up to measure the village’s fossil fuelled operational energy; village deliveries were assessed on site; fly-in/fly-out emissions were calculated according to site visits and researched emissions from air travel; desalinated water and waste water treatment energy was monitored; and food consumption and solid waste were estimated. In addition a significant energy efficiency experiment was carried out to test a thermal ceramic coating applied to a typical mine site accommodation module (donga). Methods to reduce carbon emissions were made by applying energy efficiencies and behaviour change to camp infrastructure and occupants, followed by determining potential penetration into the power generation system of appropriate renewable energy systems, and finally the purchase of accredited carbon sequestrating offsets. Significant results can be summarized: total village carbon footprints for the life spans 5 to 20 years were calculated to be between 3233 and 2424 tonnes CO 2 -e per annum respectively, equating to 19 to 14. 4 tonnes CO 2 -e per <b>village</b> <b>worker</b> annum, equivalent to the average Australian’s domestic carbon footprint to which they would contribute when they return home. In terms of net present costing converting the village energy system to a standalone type gave a clear financial advantage to the owners in averting the capital expenditure of connecting the village to mine site generation plant. With a maximum penetration of 71 percent into the village’s 1. 09 MWh energy consumption per annum the carbon reduction was small in terms of the village’s overall footprint. The donga coating experiment resulted in a 10 percent saving in air conditioning energy consumption. A generic model, LEVI (Low Energy Village Infrastructure) was developed {{in the form of an}} Excel workbook to provide a systematic method to calculate the carbon footprint of a {{built environment}} similar to that of a mine site village, such as caravan parks, remote tourism resorts, retirement villages, military camps, Aboriginal settlements and isolated research stations. LEVI was then applied specifically to the case study mine site village. Further research is required to evaluate the potential of alternative village design and operation, for example, by means of comprehensive cost-benefit analysis or multi-criteria assessment of options. Isolated examples exist in the literature and this thesis highlights areas where so much more could be achieved in the vein of carbon reduction in the built environment...|$|E

Many households therefore draw their water for drinking and cooking from untested wells. Methods A household drinking water survey of 6646 households was conducted in Singair upazilla of Bangladesh. A subset of 795 untested wells used by 1000 randomly selected households was tested in the field by trained <b>village</b> <b>workers</b> with the Hach EZ kit, using an extended reaction time of 40 min, and in the laboratory by high-resolution inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (HR ICP-MS). Results The household survey shows that more than 80 % of the wells installed since the national testing campaign in this area were untested. Less than 13 % of the households with untested wells knew where a low-As well was located near their home. <b>Village</b> <b>workers</b> using the Hach EZ kit underestimated the As content of only 4 out of 795 wells relative to the Bangladesh standard.
