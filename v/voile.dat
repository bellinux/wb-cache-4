25|$|Professional sailing in France is {{centred on}} singlehanded and shorthanded ocean racing with the {{pinnacle}} of this branch of the sport being the Vendée Globe singlehanded around the world race which starts every 4 years from the French Atlantic coast. Other significant events include the Solitaire du Figaro, Mini Transat 6.50, Tour de France a <b>Voile</b> and Route du Rhum transatlantic race. France has been a regular competitor in the America's Cup since the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Boudin and du Pont also competed {{to design}} window {{treatments}} for the Red Room. Boudin suggested straight panels of cerise silk, suspended from a gilded wood rod and rings. Du Pont proposed a lighter treatment of white cotton <b>voile</b> or muslin, drawn {{back from the}} windows with tassels. Mrs. Kennedy was concerned that du Pont's drapes would require constant pressing in order to look good, and that souvenir-hunters might snip at the tassels and fringe. Boudin's scheme won out.|$|E

25|$|Yarns {{from these}} fibers are woven into {{a variety of}} {{different}} weaves, the most notable of which include broadcloth, with double the number of warp to weft threads, giving a smooth, formal shirting; twill, where the tucks of the weft do not line up, giving a diagonal pattern, a weave used for most country checked (e.g. Tattersall) shirtings; poplin, with a heavier warp than weft, giving more formal fabric; and Oxford weaves. Plain Oxford or pinpoint Oxford weaves are popular as casual fabrics, so are generally used in combination with a button-down collar, while royal Oxford is versatile enough to be used on both sporty and formal shirts. There are many other weaves or variations on these, including end-on-end patterns, where alternate white and coloured threads are used, giving a mottled appearance, or more exotic weaves, including <b>voile</b> and batiste, which are extremely light fabrics only used for summer shirts or on the unseen parts of formal shirts.|$|E
25|$|During regular, day-to-day activities, Somali women usually {{wear the}} guntiino. It {{is a long}} stretch of cloth tied over the {{shoulder}} and draped around the waist. The cloth is usually made out of alandi, which is a textile that is common in the Horn region and some parts of North Africa. The garment can be worn in different styles. It can also be made with other fabrics, including white cloth with gold borders. For more formal settings, such as at weddings or religious celebrations like Eid, women wear the dirac. It is a long, light, diaphanous <b>voile</b> dress made of silk, chiffon, taffeta or saree fabric. The gown is worn over a full-length half-slip and a brassiere. Known as the gorgorad, the underskirt is made out of silk and serves as {{a key part of the}} overall outfit. The dirac is usually sparkly and very colorful, the most popular styles being those with gilded borders or threads.|$|E

500|$|The modern ao dai {{turned up}} several years ago. However, the ao dai {{was a concern}} of {{people who need to}} wear it as a uniform such as: teacher, flight attendance, receptionists. It was not {{until the end of the}} year 2016 did the modern ao dai become so popular with {{hundreds}} of new designs. It is modified in the collar, the sleeves or the length of two flaps. Furthermore, instead of wearing pants with the ao dai, people nowadays prefer to wear culottes and skirts inside it. Not only the change in designs, people also use different materials for the modern ao dai like silk, brocade fabric or <b>voile</b> fabric.|$|E

2500|$|Esperanto etymology, {{including}} {{vocabulary and}} grammatical forms, derives {{primarily from the}} Romance languages, with lesser contributions from Germanic. The language occupies a middle ground between [...] "naturalistic" [...] constructed languages such as Interlingua, which borrow words en masse from their source languages with little internal derivation, and a priori conlangs such as Solresol, in which the words have no historical connection to other languages. In Esperanto, root words are borrowed and retain much of the form of their source language, whether the phonetic form (eks- from international ex-, vualo from French <b>voile)</b> or orthographic form (teamo and boato from English team and boat, soifo from French soif). However, each root can then form dozens of derivations which may bear little resemblance to equivalent words in the source languages, such as registaro (government), which {{is derived from the}} Latinate root reg (to rule) but has a morphology closer to German or Russian.|$|E
