40|$|The {{potential}} of energy-conscious traditional design of dwellings has been recognised with its direct and sometimes sophisticated response to local climatic conditions in recent years. Courtyard forms, which provide heat, light, ventilation and other functions for buildings surrounding it, {{are found in}} many high density urban environments around the world. This current study focuses {{on one of the}} solutions which can contribute to embodying the energy-conscious tradition. As an issue of how buildings respond to the different climate arises on a global scale, emphasis is placed on regional urban courtyard housing, for which design proposals are made, with special reference to Seoul, Korea (latitude 37. 34 ° N). Apart from acting as climatic modifiers through solar access, courtyard housing forms can offer spatial and <b>visual</b> <b>amenities</b> to otherwise monotonous urban plan buildings. The aim {{of this study is to}} gain an understanding of the relationship between courtyard design and solar radiation in a densely built housing development. The parametric study examines the possibilities of varying housing layout factors in courtyard design, such as housing density, plot dimension, housing development scale and housing orientation, thereby suggesting guidelines for suitable ranges of the design parameters of courtyard housing. By these means, a density objective in urban area can be achieved with certain parameters with a potential to form energy-conscious courtyard design. Solutions for optimising the use of solar energy in courtyard housing layout in future housing development are categorised into (1) efficient layout planning, which include the range of optimum use of the housing layout factors and storey height under land use policy, and (2) passive courtyard housing form, which respond to urban housing layouts. Implications of the design strategies for planners, designers and local authorities are then outlined, including design guidelines...|$|R

40|$|Walking {{can be a}} safe, healthy, and {{affordable}} mode of school transportation. However, most students today do not use walking for their school travel. More {{research is needed to}} understand the correlates of walking to or from school and to identify effective interventions. This is a cross-sectional study of 73 public elementary schools in the Austin Independent School District of Texas. The first phase used geographic information systems and field audits to examine school-level disparities in the environmental support for walking in schools? attendance areas. The second phase involved surveys of students? parents or guardians to identify the multi-level correlates of using walking as their children?s typical school travel mode. In the first phase, results from analyses of variance and linear regressions indicated the existence of disparities. Lower economic status of student population was associated with poorer street conditions (e. g., maintenance, <b>visual</b> quality, <b>amenities,</b> and perceived safety), shorter distances to school, and lower traffic volumes. Higher percentage of Hispanic students within a school was associated with increased danger from traffic and crime and more sidewalks, greater population density, and mixed land uses. The second phase used binary logistic regressions to predict walking to or from school. Among the personal and social factors, parents? education, car ownership, personal barriers, and school bus availability were negative correlates, while parents? and children?s positive attitude and regular walking habit and supportive peer influences were positive correlates. Of the physical environmental factors, long distance and safety concerns were the strongest negative correlates, followed by the presence of highways or freeways, convenience stores, office buildings, and bus stops en route. In conclusion, environmental interventions are needed to develop centrallylocated neighborhood schools, barrier-free attendance areas, and well-maintained pedestrian infrastructure. Disparities and fine-grained differences are found in the environmental support for walking. A high priority for low-income, Hispanic children and interventions tailored for specific contexts and populations appear necessary. Safety improvement is indispensible in terms of both traffic and crime and should be supplemented with educational programs that target both parents and children. Finally, multi-agency collaborations are needed at the policy level to support and facilitate these multi-level interventions...|$|R
40|$|PREFACE In early America most quilts {{were made}} for {{utilitarian}} purposes. Later, when time and fabrics became more plentiful, quilt making developed into an art form which flourished during the 19 th century and continues to do so today. Within the broad definition of 2 ̆ 2 patchwork, 2 ̆ 2 three types are represented in this exhibition-pieced, applique and crazy. Pieced quilts are made from materials cut in geometric shapes and put together in pattern blocks. These blocks are repeated to form the quilt top. The designs were often of political, historical or religious events, but many also were associated with abstract visual ideas and images. 2 ̆ 2 Rocky Road to California 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Lincoln Quilt 2 ̆ 2 are examples of the first category; 2 ̆ 2 Indiana Puzzle 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Log Cabin 2 ̆ 2 the second; 2 ̆ 2 Star of Bethlehem 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Jacobs Ladder 2 ̆ 2 the third. Names, however, varied for the identical pattern in different localities. Applique quilts are made by cutting patterns and sewing them to a base cloth. Usually these were not made for regular household use, but rather tended to be the 2 ̆ 2 pretty 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 best 2 ̆ 2 quilts and had flowers, trees, birds or fruit as motifs. Crazy quilts are made of odd-shaped {{bits and pieces of}} material put together in a random pattern. These reached their artistic height in the Victorian era when fabrics such as silks and velvets replaced cottons and flannels. Creative stitchery fills in certain patches and lines the edges of others. Crazy quilts were often used as decorative throws on couches. All the quilts in this exhibition belong to either museums or individuals in Nebraska and many were made by native Nebraskans. Of special note are the five quilts created by Mrs. Grace Snyder of North Platte. Almost three hundred examples were assembled for consideration and from this number fifty-five were selected solely on their merits as works of art. Their patterns, colors and materials illustrate the wide range quilting provides for individual creativity. Considerations relating to workmanship, condition and age were not used as criteria of primary importance. From this selective sampling {{it can be seen that}} 2 ̆ 2 quilt making 2 ̆ 2 is an art form of quality and importance. INTRODUCTION A quilt is a bedcover, that 2 ̆ 7 s for sure, but it is not a coverlet nor is it a counterpane. It is usually made of two thicknesses of fabric, the top or front pieced together from a variety of materials in a number of colors; the back or lining is generally of one piece in one color, the two frequently but not invariably sandwich a layer of soft padding and the whole thing is stitched through from front to back in a pattern which may conform tei the pieced design or may, on the contrary, follow its own pattern in a kind of visual counterpoint. The pattern can be further embellished with needlework of various kinds, ornamental or commemorative, and, after generations of practice and invention, quilt making has achieved an iconography of its own reflecting the domestic inspirations of uncounted, anonymous, female artists. One has only to recite the names of the traditional patterns to sense the interplay of skill and imagination which makes a quilt into a work of art. At their functional level they have kept the sleeper warm. In addition they have filled the role of social coordinator. They have been the inspiration of virtuoso needlework as well as creative invention. They have been valued elements in a dowry and part of an inheritance handed down through the generations of a family. At their most extraordinary levels of accomplishment they have been status symbols, entirely divorced from the vulgarity of use. Nowadays they are apt to hang on a wall like a painting and to even hang on the walls of an art gallery, their apotheosis achieved. All these considerations have come into play in the organization of this exhibition and it is more than a pleasure to acknowledge the hard work of the members of the Lincoln Quilters Guild and the staff of the Sheldon Gallery in bringing to public attention the achievements of this traditional anonymous art as it exists in the public and private collections of Nebraska. Fortunately, some of the makers are known to us, some of them are giving the art its contemporary form, and we are happy to give them the recognition they deserve. As a gallery-community collaboration it is a pleasure to acknowledge in particular Mrs. Velda Coffey, who first brought the idea of the exhibition to our consideration, Mrs. Mary Ghormley, Mrs. Louise Howey, Mrs. Jean Harnsberger, Mrs. Sally Campbell all of whom provided the knowledge, energy and enthusiasm which is so necessary to the realization of such projects.

Lastly, the catalogue which provides a permanent record of the event, is in no small way the result of the fastidious professionalism of Kaz Tada and Paul Bateman...|$|R

40|$|Kempton, WillettEnergy use {{is central}} to the modern lifestyle, but {{producing}} this energy often comes at an environmental cost. The three studies in this paper look at the tradeoffs involved in energy production. The first looks at transitioning marine vessels to natural gas from current distillate fuels. While natural gas will reduce local air pollutants, such as sulfur oxides and particulate matter, the implications for greenhouse gases depend on how the natural gas is extracted, processed, distributed, and used. Applying a "technology warming potential" (TWP) approach, natural gas as a marine fuel achieves climate parity within 30 years for diesel ignited engines, though it could take up to 190 years to reach climate parity with conventional fuels in a spark ignited engine. Movement towards natural gas as a marine fuel continues to progress, and conditions exist in some regions to make a near-term transition to natural gas feasible. The second study looks at externalities associated with electricity generation. The impact on the surrounding community is one concern when siting new electricity generating facilities. A survey was conducted of residents living near an industrial scale wind turbine and a coal-fired power plant to determine their visual and auditory effects on the residents. Results concluded that respondents living near the wind turbine were in favor of the facility. They were willing to pay an average of $ 2. 56 a month to keep the turbine in its current location. Respondents living near the coal plant were opposed to the facility. They were willing to spend $ 1. 82 a month to have the facility removed. The third study presents a cost effectiveness analysis of three of the main fuels used for electricity generation, namely coal, natural gas, and wind. This analysis adds social costs to the private costs traditionally utilized by investors making decisions. It utilizes previous research on <b>visual</b> and auditory <b>amenity</b> and disamenity values as well as recent published studies on the impacts of electricity generation on water use, wildlife, and property values, among others, as well as other impacts well documented in the literature. When literature values were not identical, low, medium, and high values were considered in order to look at the full range of values. On average, the cost of wind power is $ 0. 0332 /kWh, natural gas power is $ 0. 1071 /kWh, and coal $ 0. 1314 /kWh. University of Delaware, School of Marine Science and PolicyPh. D...|$|R
40|$|There’s {{no need to}} look far for the villains, says long-time Canberra {{resident}} and Canberra Times editor-in-chief Jack Waterford IS THERE anything more certain than that the various inquiries and inquests into Canberra’s town fires will find a catalogue of incompetence, mismanagement, poor planning and slow reactions? That warnings were ignored, danger signals missed, resources misdeployed and some simply {{not up to the}} job? Personally, I’m suspending my judgment, though I am prepared to bet that the evidence will ultimately show that many more people would have died had all of the resources been right {{in the right place at}} just the right time. Hindsight, however, will invariably show that things could have been better managed, that some clues were staring the managers in the face but unaccountably ignored, and that some of them were not quite up to the task. Who could be surprised, given the relatively low priority emergency services takes almost all of the time? The prospect of canonisation, of finding oneself as Alan Stretton, the hero of Darwin after Cyclone Tracy, or of Phil Koperberg in Sydney every other summer, is ever lower than the prospect of one of Australia’s colonels actually leading Australian troops in combat. One might train all one’s life for it but the paradox is that real success is never having to demonstrate your capacity. And the irony is that the more successful one is at doing so, the more likely it is that the risk managers will progressively starve you of resources, on the basis that the probabilities are low. Most of the time there’s not even the adrenalin rush of actually being involved in actual firefighting, or of being saluted, rightly, as one of the real heroes of a bushfire: the frontline people in danger in front of the flames. Bushfire management is staff work, involving tactics, strategy, communications and logistics, and managers who lead from the front, like generals who do so, are often bloody nuisances. As the horror of January 2 ̆ 7 s inferno became clear, there was much obvious anger shown by residents and others at the front. Where had the resources been? Why did it seem to take so long to react? Much of the anger, however, subsided, first, in a wave of empathy for those who had been doing an impossible task, and second, as it was appreciated that all of the resources in the world could not have stopped the monster which had been unleashed. Indeed, by the time the fire was roaring into Duffy, it is likely that a battalion of fire crews would themselves have been enveloped, particularly had they focused on anything other than saving people. Firefighters are trained in avoiding danger, but the risk of casualties when they see themselves as standing between members of the community and the holocaust is very high. Even now, many Canberrans will not abide criticism of the men and women who fought the flames, and, in some cases, beat them back. In time, however, some will find it easier to distinguish between these and those who deployed them for action. Some will focus on the decision-making shortly before the inferno: what happened when the wind began its assault towards Eucumbene Drive? How long did it take people to react? Were the responses and redeployments the most sensible in the circumstances? And others will focus on a longer time frame, whether the long-term total strategy of fuel reduction, the fact of bush at the suburbs’ gate, or the wisdom of pine next to houses, or, at the firefighting strategy in the week up to the disaster, which culminated in wind changes and a fire suddenly getting right away. I pity those who will find themselves in the frame, because it is in the nature of things that one appreciates with hindsight that one might have responded better, and that inquiries end up looking for someone to blame. The fact is that most of the base conditions for the fire were products of what the community and the nation wanted, by way of a city nestled in, rather than standing knob-like out of, the bush. Even the pine forests, long after their economic use-by date, followed not only conscious decisions to make Canberra self- sufficient for timber, but the idea of a buffer zone inhibiting further suburban development. And, if risky from a fire perspective, it was well integrated into the local lifestyle. But more than this calculus at heaven was involved. The loss of 550 houses sounds appalling, and, of course, it is. But the actuary might see it somewhat differently. Over the past 50 years, say, the risk of a Canberra house’s being burnt in a bushfire has been about one in 8000 in any given year. Still too high for my liking, but that represents a considerable long-term profit for the insurance companies, paying out for the first time ever. No doubt we could get better fire-management plans which did not turn our suburbia into concrete pathways, and better bush fuel-reduction schemes which preserve our <b>visual</b> and environmental <b>amenity.</b> Just as people accept some risk on the roads, fire is a part of our landscape which we accept rather than having our landscapes too much altered. It is highly doubtful that the actions of another 200 emergency services managers and operatives, idle for much of the year, could much alter the odds. Maybe the villains are ourselves, not those who coped the best they could, with the knowledge and the resources they had.

Sunderland claimed that in 1999 these elements were desired but unrealistic, but in 2001 they had {{been added to the}} list of essential Academy elements by the FA, and therefore to retain Academy status, Sunderland were obliged to include them in the plans.Sunderland submitted the application in May 2002, and in August the plans were reject by South Tyneside council, who said: We felt they were inappropriate for the green belt.Again Sunderland appealed, and a public inquiry was launched in April 2003.In November of that year, the Secretary of State rejected Sunderland's revised plans [...] claiming the new elements would [...] "cause significant harm to the openness and <b>visual</b> <b>amenity</b> of this sensitive part of the green belt.". This ruling came despite Sunderland's argument that similar green belt developments at Manchester United, Arsenal and Middlesbrough had been accepted.By this point, the initial phase of the academy had been built, with area set aside for the proposed indoor barn and hostel. The ruling meant that in order to retain Academy status, Sunderland would have to find alternative sites for those elements of the academy, or abandon and relocate the entire centre.|$|E
