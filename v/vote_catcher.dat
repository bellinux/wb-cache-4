5000|$|Starting pitcher Bob Tewksbury posted {{his best}} {{season with a}} 2.16 ERA, second-best in the NL, and topped the league walks per nine innings and strikeout-to-walk ratio. [...] He {{finished}} third in the Cy Young <b>voting.</b> [...] <b>Catcher</b> Tom Pagnozzi posted the sixteenth best single-season fielding mark (tied) in history for his position (.9987).|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, Solís {{played for}} the Double-A San Antonio Missions, hitting [...]283 with 6 home runs in 87 games. He {{appeared}} in the All-Star Futures Game {{as a replacement for}} Yasmani Grandal. He was <b>voted</b> the top <b>catcher,</b> along with Lars Davis, in the Texas League.|$|R
50|$|In April 2016, a {{grassroots}} campaign {{was formed to}} <b>vote</b> the journeyman <b>catcher</b> into the 2016 All Star Game. The movement drew comparisons to hockey player John Scott's fan selection to the 2016 NHL All Star Game. On April 21, 2016, Ross caught his first no-hitter, against the Cincinnati Reds, his former team, with starting pitcher Jake Arrieta. Ross hit his 100th home run off of Adam Morgan of the Philadelphia Phillies on May 27, 2016.|$|R
2500|$|MLB {{announced}} rosters for the 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game on July 4, {{and five}} Cardinals made the NL team. [...] Albert Pujols led the National League in votes. Yadier Molina was <b>voted</b> starting <b>catcher</b> for the NL squad despite {{having one of}} the worst seasons of his career, with a [...]229 batting average on the day the rosters were announced. Chris Carpenter and Adam Wainwright were named to the pitching staff, and Matt Holliday was selected as a reserve. In the game, played in Anaheim on July 13, Pujols was 0-for-2, Molina was 1-for-1 with a single, Holliday singled and scored, Wainwright pitched a scoreless seventh, but Carpenter was held back in reserve and did not pitch. Holliday scored on a three-run double by the Braves' Brian McCann that won the All-Star Game, 3-1, giving the National League their first win since the 1996.|$|R
5000|$|Sent to Double-A Frisco {{early in}} the 2010 season, Teagarden was called {{back up to the}} Majors in July 2010 due to the {{injuries}} of catcher Matt Treanor. While at Double-A Frisco, he finished fourth in the fan <b>vote</b> for A.L. <b>catcher</b> for the 2010 All-Star game with 631,674 votes, above Major League catchers John Buck of the Blue Jays, Mike Napoli of the Angels and A. J. Pierzynski of the White Sox. [...] Teagarden hit three home runs in his first five games after his July recall from the minors.|$|R
5|$|On June 19, 2015, in a 9–5 {{win over}} the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium, Posey hit a grand slam and stole a base, {{becoming}} the first Giants catcher in 112 years since Roger Bresnahan to accomplish the feat. Four days later, in a 6–0 {{win over the}} San Diego Padres at AT Park, Posey hit another grand slam. On July 5, 2015, Posey was selected to his third career All-Star Game and was number one in <b>voting</b> for NL <b>catchers.</b> On September 6, 2015, at Coors Field, in a 7–4 win over the Colorado Rockies, Posey hit his 100th career home run.|$|R
50|$|The {{committee}} apparently made {{an attempt}} to elect players at positions which were not yet represented in the Hall; by 1945, the BBWAA had elected 20th century players at every position except catcher, third base and left field. The committee's election of Jimmy Collins corrected {{the absence of a}} third baseman, as he was generally regarded as the game's greatest player at the position to that time and had consistently finished first among third basemen in the BBWAA voting, usually outpolling the combined totals of all others at the position. His career spanned the years 1894 to 1908, easily allowing him to be considered a star in both centuries. The committee's choices at the other two positions also followed the BBWAA <b>vote</b> closely. <b>Catcher</b> Roger Bresnahan had finished first among catchers in most of the BBWAA elections, with only the recently retired Mickey Cochrane competing for the top spot. In the voting since 1937, Fred Clarke had trailed only Ed Delahanty - who died in 1903 - among left fielders. Both Bresnahan and Clarke were stars of the 1900s who had made their major league debuts in the 1890s, making them eligible for selection by the Old-Timers.|$|R
2500|$|Lopata {{started the}} 1956 season by {{splitting}} time with Seminick, {{but after a}} slow start by Seminick, Lopata finally emerged as an everyday player, {{making the most of}} it by slamming 32 home runs while driving in 95 runs in 146 games. Stan had many highlights that year. He had a walk-off home run against the Milwaukee Braves on June 27 {{in the bottom of the}} 11th inning to win the game 4–3. Lopata finished fourth in the fan <b>voting</b> for <b>catchers</b> on the National League all-star roster, tallying 16,197 votes. He received his second all-star nomination when a roster spot opened up after Braves catcher Del Crandall was injured and unable to play. On August 11, Lopata ended Brooklyn Dodgers hurler Don Newcombe's 39 scoreless innings streak with a two-run home run in a 5–2 losing effort. Lopata led all major league catchers in slugging percentage by posting up a [...]535 mark. His 32 home runs set a since-broken Phillies' team record for right-handed batters. The Phillies had a lackluster season overall with a 71–83 record, but management did not fault Lopata. They had so much faith in him that after the season was over, they stated that every player on the roster was subject to possible trade except for Lopata.|$|R
