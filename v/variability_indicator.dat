40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} detecting sleepiness in car drivers. First, a variety of sleepiness indicators (based on driving behavior) proposed in the literature were evaluated. These indicators were then subjected to parametric optimization using stochastic optimization methods. To improve performance, the functional form {{of some of the}} indicators was generalized before optimization. Next, using a neural network, the best performing sleepiness indicators were combined with a mathematical model of sleepiness, i. e., the sleep/wake predictor (SWP). The analyses were based on data obtained from a study that involved 12 test subjects at the moving-base driving simulator at the Swedish National Road and Transportation Research Institute (VTI), Linkping, Sweden. The data were derived from 12 1 -h driving sessions for each test subject, with varying degrees of sleepiness. The performance measure (range [0, 1]) for indicators was taken as the average of sensitivity and specificity. Starting with indicators proposed in the literature, the best such indicator, i. e., the standard deviation of the yaw angle, reached a performance score of 0. 72 on previously unseen test data. It was found that indicators based on a given signal gave essentially equal performance after parametric optimization, but in no case was it better than 0. 72. The best generalized indicator (the generic <b>variability</b> <b>indicator)</b> obtained a performance score of 0. 74. SWP achieved a score of 0. 78. However, by nonlinearly combining SWP with the generic <b>variability</b> <b>indicator,</b> a score of 0. 83 was obtained. Thus, the results imply that a nonlinear combination of a measure based on driving behavior with a model of sleepiness significantly improves driver sleepiness detection...|$|E

This review aims to determine the consistency of results reported on the autonomic response to physical exercise as measured by heart rate variability, blood pressure variability and baroreceptor sensitivity. METHOD: An Ovid MEDLINE Database search for the period 1950 - March 2008 produced 46 articles for review. The published articles that evaluate the effect of exercise on the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are summarised in three categories: the response of the ANS during a bout of exercise, directly after exercise (recovery measurements), and after a long-term exercise programme. RESULTS: Articles on the effect of training on the ANS as measured by cardiovascular <b>variability</b> <b>indicators</b> show increased <b>variability,</b> decreased variability, and no change in variability. CONCLUSION: Findings in this review emphasise that standardisation and refinement of these measuring tools are essential to produce results that can be repeated and used as reference. Standardisation is essential as these measurements are increasingly employed in studies regarding investigations of central autonomic regulation, those exploring the link between psychological processes and physiological functioning, and those indicating ANS activity in response to exercise, training and overtraining. This review shows that important aspects are inter-individual differences, duration and intensity of the exercise programme, and choice and specific implementation of variability analysis techniques...|$|R

40|$|Glucose {{variability}} {{has recently}} been investigated in diabetic patients in several studies, {{but most of them}} considered only a few <b>variability</b> <b>indicators</b> and did not systematically correlate them with patients' HbA 1 c levels and other important characteristics. In thus study, the correlations between HbA 1 c levels and metabolic control (average glucose, AG), glucose variability (SD, CONGA, MAGE, MODD, BG ROC), hyperglycemia (HBGI), hypoglycemia (LBGI) and postprandial (AUC PP) indices were investigated in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The study involved 68 patients divided into 3 groups as follows: 35 patients had type 1 diabetes (group 1); 17 had type 2 diabetes and were taking multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin (group 2); and 16 patients had type 2 diabetes treated with OHA and/or basal insulin (group 3). The indicators were obtained over at least 48 h using a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. HbA 1 c levels were measured at the baseline and after CGM. HbA 1 c correlated significantly with AG (r = 0. 74), AUC PP (r = 0. 69) and HBGI (r = 0. 74), but only in type 1 diabetic patients. Patients with longstanding disease and type 1 diabetes had a greater glucose variability, irrespective of their HbA 1 c levels. Insulin therapy with MDI correlated strongly with HbA 1 c, but not with glucose variability. HbA 1 c levels identify states of sustained hyperglycemia and seem to be unaffected by hypoglycemic episodes or short-lived glucose spikes, consequently revealing shortcomings as a "gold standard" indicator of metabolic control.

40|$|Many quasi-simultaneous optical {{observations}} of 17 blazars are obtained from previous papers published {{over the last}} 19 years in order to investigate the spectral slope variability and understand the radiation mechanism of blazars. The long-period dereddened optical spectral slopes are calculated. We analyse the average spectral slope distribution, {{which suggests that the}} spectra of flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and high energy peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs) are probably deformed by other emission components. The average spectral slopes of low energy peaked BL Lac objects(LBLs), which scatter around 1. 5, show a good accordance with the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) loss-dominated model. We present and discuss the variability between the spectral slope and optical luminosity. The spectra of all HBLs and LBLs get flatter when they turn brighter, while for FSRQs this trend does not exist or may even be reversed. This phenomenon may imply that there is a thermal contribution to the optical spectrum for FSRQs. For the FSRQ 1156 + 295, there is a hint that the slope gets flatter at both the brightest and faintest states. Our result shows that three subclasses locate in different regions in the pattern of slope <b>variability</b> <b>indicator</b> versus average spectral slope.

40|$|Objective: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} medical literature on the association between glucose variability measures and mortality in critically ill patients. Methods: Studies assessing the association between a measure of glucose variability and mortality that reported original data from a clinical trial or observational study on critically ill adult patients were searched in Ovid MEDLINE (R) and Ovid EMBASE (R). Data on patient populations, study designs, glucose regulations, statistical approaches, outcome measures, and glucose variability indicators (their definition and applicability) were extracted. Result: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria; 13 different indicators were used to measure glucose variability. Standard deviation {{and the presence of}} both hypo-and hyperglycemia were the most common indicators. All studies reported a statistically significant association between mortality and at least one glucose <b>variability</b> <b>indicator.</b> In four studies both blood glucose levels and severity of illness were considered as confounders, but only one of them checked model assumptions to assert inference validity. Conclusions: Glucose variability has been quantified in many different ways, and in each study {{at least one of them}} appeared to be associated with mortality. Because of methodological limitations and the possibility of reporting bias, it is still unsettled whether and in which quantification this association is independent of other confounders.

40|$|Aims. The {{study of}} the {{ensemble}} properties of the UV/optical broadband variability of quasars is hampered by the combined effects of the dependence of variability on timescale, rest-frame wavelength, and luminosity. Here, we present {{a new approach to}} analysing the dependence of quasar variability on rest-frame wavelengths. Methods. We exploited the spectral archive of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to create a sample of over 9000 quasars in the Stripe 82. The quasar catalogue was matched with the Light Motion Curve Catalogue for SDSS Stripe 82 and first-order structure functions were computed from the lightcurves. The structure functions are used to create a <b>variability</b> <b>indicator</b> that is related to the same intrinsic timescales for all quasars (about 1 to 2 yr in the rest-frame). We study the variability ratios for adjacent SDSS filter bands as a function of redshift. A quantitative interpretation of these relations is provided by comparing with the results of simple Monte Carlo simulations of variable quasar spectra. Results. We confirm the well-known dependence of variability on time-lag; the best power-law fit of the sample-averaged structure function has a slope β = 0. 31 ± 0. 03. We also confirm that anti-correlations exist with luminosity, wavelength, and redshift, where the latter can be fully explained {{as a consequence of the}} former two dependencies. The variability ratios as a function of redshift resemble the corresponding colour index-redshift relations. While variability is almost always stronger in the bluer passband than in the redder, the variability ratio depends on whether strong emission lines contribute to either one band or the other.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to analysing the dependence of quasar variability on rest-frame wavelengths. We exploited the spectral archive of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to create a sample of more than 9000 quasars in the Stripe 82. The quasar catalogue was matched with the Light Motion Curve Catalogue for SDSS Stripe 82 and individual first-order structure functions were computed. The structure functions are used to create a <b>variability</b> <b>indicator</b> that is related to the same intrinsic timescales for all quasars (1 to 2 yr in the rest frame). We study the variability ratios for adjacent SDSS filter bands as a function of redshift. While variability is almost always stronger in the bluer passband compared to the redder, the variability ratio depends on whether strong emission lines contribute to either one band or the other. The variability ratio-redshift relations resemble the corresponding colour index-redshift relations. From the comparison with Monte Carlo simulations of variable quasar spectra we find that the observed variability ratio-redshift relations are closely fitted assuming that (a) the r. m. s. fluctuation of the quasar continuum follows a power law-dependence on the intrinsic wavelength with an exponent - 2 (i. e., bluer when brighter) and (b) the variability of the emission line flux is only about 10 % of that of the underlying continuum. These results, based upon the photometry of more than 8000 quasars, confirm the previous findings by Wilhite et al. (2005) from 315 quasars with repeated SDSS spectroscopy. Finally, we find that quasars with unusual spectra and weak emission lines tend to have less variability than conventional quasars. This trend is opposite to what is expected from the dilution effect of variability due to line emission and may be indicative of high Eddington ratios in these unconventinal quasars.

40|$|The present Master's thesis {{deals with}} the {{forensic}} use of fundamental frequency characteristics, specifically with F 0 mean values and <b>indicators</b> of <b>variability.</b> Phoneticians who specialise in the forensic analysis of speech generally believe that F 0 does not hold much potential as a parameter useful for speaker identification, mainly because it is easily influenced by extrinsic factors (e. g. the speaker's emotional state, interfering noise, transmission channel or even the speaker's own effort to mask his voice), which cause high intra-individual variability. Despite these facts, however, the forensic use of F 0 offers a number of advantages, namely straightforward extraction from the speech signal and lower susceptibility to varying lexical content - unlike, for example, vowel formants. This thesis investigates the recordings of 8 male speakers made in two different speech styles (spontaneous and read) and compares the respective indicators of F 0 stability and variability, in particular those that are robust in varying external conditions: that is, the baseline for mean values and the 10. - 90. percentile range for <b>variability</b> <b>indicators.</b> Apart from that, we take into account phenomena such as the creaky voice, which are idiosyncratic and contribute to easier speaker discrimination.

The {{aim of this study}} is to establish the relationship, if any, between the sites of optical and X-ray variability, and thereby to elucidate the origins of X-ray production in PMS stars. In a previous paper we showed that optical and X-ray variability in PMS stars are very rarely time-correlated. Here, using time-averaged <b>variability</b> <b>indicators</b> to examine the joint occurrences of optical and X-ray variability, we confirm that the two forms of variability are not directly causally related. However, a strong and highly statistically significant correlation is found between optical variability and X-ray luminosity. As this correlation is found to be independent of accretion activity, we argue that X-ray production in PMS stars must instead be intimately connected with the presence and strength of optically variable, magnetically active surface regions (i. e. spots) on these stars. Moreover, because X-ray variability and optical variability are rarely time-correlated, we conclude that the sites of X-ray production are not exclusively co-spatial with these regions. We argue that solar-analog coronae, heated by topologically complex fields, can explain these findings. Comment: To appear in the Astrophysical Journal. 33 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|To be {{successful}} in companies, a production planning and control (PPC) concept should fit to the production environment. Essential elements of the concept should correspond with {{the characteristics of the}} production system. For classical concepts such as MRP these elements have become common sense. For example BOMexplosion and constant lead times make MRP known to perform best in environments with high material and low capacity complexity. For many other concepts the situation is less clear. In this paper the Workload Control (WLC) concept is considered for which the requirements for a successful application have never been investigated. A framework is proposed to explore the applicability of WLC in small- to medium-sized make-to-order (MTO) companies. It supports an initial consideration of WLC in the first phase of a PPC selection and implementation process. As a first step in developing the framework the inherent characteristics of the WLC concept and the relevant MTO production characteristics are identified. Confronting the indicators of the company characteristics with the WLC elements results in bestfit indications for the WLC concept. Contrarily to other PPC evaluation schemes the framework considers <b>variability</b> <b>indicators</b> besides averages. Use of this framework for a medium sized MTO company demonstrates its suitability in getting a systematic and quick impression of the applicability of WLC.

The question was asked whether cynical attitudes that develop due to work-related stress correlate with stress levels and whether it has a negative influence on health. OBJECTIVES: To investigate associations of the cynicism subscale scores of the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS) with levels of stress, anxiety, questionnaire-based physical health and {{with a number of}} physiological health risk indicators. METHODS: Cynicism, anxiety, questionnaire-based physical health scores, as well as allostatic load, heart rate variability and C-reactive protein, were assessed in 27 males working between 40 and 80 irregular hours per week. RESULTS: Cynicism scores related to stress levels (r= 0. 411, p= 0. 030). Effects of work-related cynicism on physical health were suggested by negative associations with questionnaire-based scores on physical health (r=- 0. 383, p= 0. 044) and heart rate <b>variability</b> <b>indicators</b> (r=- 0. 379, p= 0. 047 to r=- 0. 496, p= 0. 007), and by positive associations with anxiety levels (r= 0. 408, p= 0. 031), heart rate (r= 0. 449, p= 0. 017), BMI (r= 0. 426, p= 0. 024) allostatic load (r= 0. 360, p= 0. 065) and levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (r= 0. 407, p= 0. 035).

Using a broad battery of computerized tasks, and both conventional and ex-Gaussian <b>indicators</b> of RT <b>variability,</b> in addition to within-task manipulations of incentive and event rate (ER), this study comprehensively examined the breadth, specificity, and possible moderators of effects of MPH on RT variability. A total of 93 children with ADHD completed a 4 -week within-subject, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of MPH to identify an optimal dosage. Children were then randomly assigned to receive either their optimal MPH dose or placebo after which they completed five neuropsychological tasks, each allowing trial-by-trial assessment of RTs. Stimulant effects on RT variability were observed on both measures of the total RT distribution (ie, coefficient of variation) as well as on an ex-Gaussian measure examining the exponential portion of the RT distribution (ie, τ). There was minimal, if any, effect of MPH on performance accuracy or RT speed. Within-task incentive and ER manipulations did not appreciably affect stimulant effects across the tasks. The pattern of significant and pervasive effects of MPH on RT variability, and few effects of MPH on accuracy and RT speed suggest that MPH primarily affects RT variability.

40|$|A {{summary of}} the {{photometric}} data obtained by the Hipparcos and Tycho missions is presented. The photometric signals and their reduction to magnitudes are described, {{as well as the}} passbands and their evolution. The main mission photometry provided on average 110 observations for each of the 118 000 stars observed during the mission. The accuracies for this epoch photometry range from a few millimagnitudes for the brightest stars to a few hundreds of a magnitude for the fainter ones. The data coverage was very much a function of ecliptic latitude, with the most homogeneous coverage near the ecliptic poles, and the most observations close to ecliptic latitude 47. The Hipparcos epoch photometry for all stars was investigated for variability and around 970 new periodic variables were discovered, as well as some 7000 unresolved variables (including micro variables, irregular variables, as well as variables for which a period could not be determined based on the Hipparcos data only). Median magnitudes as well as course <b>variability</b> <b>indicators,</b> derived from the epoch photometry, are included in the the main astrometric catalogue. All Hipparcos epoch photometry has been made available on the ASCII CD-ROM, disks 2 and 3. The Tycho epoch photometry was of lower accuracy, but provided useful colour index information. Only epoch photometry for a selection of the brighter stars in the Tycho catalogue has been preserved on the ASCII CD-ROM disk 4. More epoch photometry can be obtained through the CDS in Strasbourg.

Further asteroseismic constraints {{can be obtained from}} studying ensembles of stars in a young open cluster, which all have similar age, distance and chemical composition. AIMS: To improve our comprehension of the beta Cep stars, we studied the young open cluster NGC 884 to discover new B-type pulsators, besides the two known beta Cep stars, and other variable stars. METHODS: An extensive multi-site campaign was set up to gather accurate CCD photometry time series in four filters (U, B, V, I) of a field of NGC 884. Fifteen different instruments collected almost 77500 CCD images in 1286 hours. The images were calibrated and reduced to transform the CCD frames into interpretable differential light curves. Various <b>variability</b> <b>indicators</b> and frequency analyses were applied to detect variable stars in the field. Absolute photometry was taken to deduce some general cluster and stellar properties. RESULTS: We achieved an accuracy for the brightest stars of 5. 7 mmag in V, 6. 9 mmag in B, 5. 0 mmag in I and 5. 3 mmag in U. The noise level in the amplitude spectra is 50 micromag in the V band. Our campaign confirms the previously known pulsators, and we report more than one hundred new multi- and mono-periodic B-, A- and F-type stars. Their interpretation in terms of classical instability domains is not straightforward, pointing to imperfections in theoretical instability computations. In addition, we have discovered six new eclipsing binaries and four candidates as well as other irregular variable stars in the observed field.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the <b>{{variability}}</b> of <b>indicators</b> of water snake pholidosis in populations of Volga Akhtubinsk and Don flood-plains. The article shows {{that the number of}} plates on snake’s body is quite steady. The limits of variability of these features in the studied populations are slightly wider, than the species limits mentioned in literature. The author makes distinctions in the nature of variability of bilateral structures. The number of the first row temporal plates is stable, while the combination of the supralabial, postorbital and preorbital is more varied. The combination of the second row temporal and lower-labial plates is mostly varied; they are characterized by the highest level of polymerization. The indicators of pholidosis are distinguished by variability degree: the lowerand supralabial plates variability is minimal (to 10...|$|R

Packing of cylindrical particles is simulated using Grains 3 D DEM code and results are analyzed in terms of void fraction using 3 D analysis tools. With tube diameter as a secondary parameter, we investigate the porous structure depending on the pellet length distribution: average porosity, radial porosity, orientation of the pellets and <b>variability</b> of those <b>indicators</b> when repeating the numerical experiments...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} a neoclassical stochastic {{endogenous growth}} {{model in which}} terms-of-trade uncertainty affects savings and consumption growth. The model explains the positive link between growth and the average rate of change of terms of trade found in recent empirical studies. In addition, terms-of-trade <b>variability,</b> as an <b>indicator</b> of risk, {{is found to be}} a key determinant of growth. This implies that welfare costs of uncertainty are much larger than conventional measures of costs of consumption instability. The model's key predictions are strongly supported by results of panel regressions. Economic development; Regression analysis...|$|R
30|$|The <b>variability</b> of <b>indicators</b> of under-assessment {{was very}} large except for Sainte-Anne. Thus, if {{respondents}} {{from the three}} other study sites displayed indicators from 0.20 % to 100 %, those from Sainte-Anne presented a minimum indicator of 33.9 %. The average indicators of under-assessment (78 %) were {{higher than the average}} indicators of over-assessment (44 %) for all study sites. Thus, respondents were more likely to under-assess than over-assess the spatial extent of areas exposed to coastal flooding. Average indicators of under-assessment of respondents from Châtelaillon-Plage (85 %) and from Saintes-Maries-de-la-mer (83 %) were higher than the average indicator (78 %). Despite the fact that the average indicators of over-assessment and under-assessment of respondents in Saintes-Maries-de-la-mer were less precise in their calculation than the other study sites, they provided information about the general trend of individuals’ perception of the spatial extent of areas exposed to coastal flooding. In fact, respondents that lived in this municipality are more likely to under-assess than over-assess the exposed areas.|$|R
40|$|Climate {{variability}} {{and extreme}} events have wide range economic, {{social and environmental}} impacts. In adaptation of these impacts, {{it is very important}} to assess and change the perception and awareness level of local community to climate variability and adaptation responses. Assessing the indigenous adaptation mechanisms and adaptation capacity is the integral part in addressing the adverse consequences of climate variability. There was no study, which assessed the adaptation to climate variability with integrating community perception in the study area. Thus, this study was aimed to fill this gap. The study has shown that, majority of participants were observed the existence of climate <b>variability</b> and <b>indicators,</b> But significant number of participants failed to perceive the causes of the variability. The effects of climate variability in the study area are land degradation, deforestation, decline of crop production, death of livestock, loss of grazing land, and destruction of infrastructures.
