50|$|StarChase is {{the trade}} {{name of a}} less-lethal <b>vehicle</b> <b>tagging</b> system {{developed}} early in 2006 to tag, track and locate a fleeing vehicle of interest to police. Its components consist of a tag, a small projectile with the end covered in a viscous adhesive which contains a GPS locator and a transmitter, fired by compressed air from a small launcher on the front grille of a police car. The system was developed to reduce the need for, and the inherent danger of, high speed pursuits, {{many of which are}} precipitated by traffic violations where the motorist is later found to have outstanding business with the court system.|$|E
40|$|In RFID reader systems, power {{amplifier}} plays a critical rule for efficiency enhancement. A high efficiency {{power amplifier}} may not only increase {{the life expectancy}} of portable RFID devices but also reduce the reliance on heat sinks. Heat sinks usually occupy plenty of space and lead to packing difficulties. A well-designed power amplifier with high efficiency and output power may also increase the reading range of RFID and system reliability, especially for the applications requiring long reading range (e. g. <b>vehicle</b> <b>tagging</b> in complicated traffics) or in a lossy environment (e. g. in sensing in rainy weather). This chapter systematically introduces the typical power amplifiers classified as Class A, AB, B, E, and F. The principles of Class F are emphasized due to its outstanding performance in efficiency enhancement. A practical design example is also presented, and also some recent typical techniques for improving the performances of Class F power amplifier are summarized. 17 page(s...|$|E
