An important element of these networks is the radio resources. Sharing resources between different users and different services is a key concept of radio resources dimensioning in GSM/GPRS networks. In this paper {{we focus on the}} problem of performance evaluation in GSM/GPRS networks. We consider different resources allocation strategies such as: CP (Complete Partitioning) and PP (Partial Partitioning) and we study the influence of different operational details concerning TS (time-slots) assignment: FR (full rate), HR (half rate) and packing. Finally, we establish dimensioning rules based on traffic evaluation and quality of service level for GSM/GPRS users. For voice users the quality of service is given by the blocking probability calculated according to the proposed packing rule and for GPRS users the individual throughput and the blocking probability represent the performance parameters.

40|$|Abstract—VoIP is {{a rapidly}} growing {{technology}} that enables the transport of <b>voice</b> <b>over</b> <b>data</b> networks such as the public Internet. VoIP became {{a viable alternative to}} the public switched telephone networks (PSTNs). In parallel, a dramatic increase is happening in the deployment of Wireless Local Areas Networks (WLAN) in buildings and corporate campuses. Nowadays, WLAN is mostly used for ordinary data services such as web browsing, file transfer and electronic mail. However, with the emerging usage of VoIP telephony, WLAN are sought to be used as an access infrastructure for enabling such applications. One of the issues of using VoIP over WLAN is the effects caused by users roaming within and between WLAN subnets during a VoIP session. The latency and the jitter are greatly impacted when the control of the mobile node is handed over from one access point (AP) to another one. This poses a challenge to providing and preserving QoS for VoIP users in WLAN environments. In this paper, we propose to study and measure the effect of the handover for both intra and inter mobility for VoIP traffic.

The purpose of this study is to assess the suitability of the H. 323 standard for establishing and performing real time voice conversations over IP networks. The goals of the study were to: (1) examine the current status of Internet Telephony, (2) conduct research on the current Internet Telephony software solutions in terms of quality, performance, interoperability and H. 323 compliance, (3) analyze and evaluate the H. 323 standard, (4) compare H. 323 with Session Initiation Protocol, and (5) provide recommendations for further improvements of H. 323. The study shows the complexity of H. 323 and highlights the areas where more considerations are required. Part of the study includes the testing of 10 Internet Telephony programs. The tests show that H. 323 compliance does not guarantee interoperability and voice quality. Also it is shown that the standard is not yet mature despite its popularity. However, it is assessed that Internet Telephony is a technology which will experience tremendous expansion during the forthcoming years.

40|$|Long Term Evolution (LTE) is {{the latest}} high speed mobile {{broadband}} technology that is gaining widespread attention due to its high data rates and improved Quality of Service (QoS). Initially, LTE {{was seen as a}} technology for supporting high speed data, but there is a growing interest in the industry to support voice over LTE. The support of voice over LTE has lot of challenges owing to the fact that both voice and data traffic are to be carried over the same radio and core networks. The optimum usage of resources in the radio network is of high importance as there is a growing need to improve the capacity at reduced cost. The transport network is another key area that needs to be carefully planned according to the capacity of the radio network. Differentiation and scheduling of resources in the transport network {{plays a key role in}} guaranteeing good end to end performance for both voice and data services. In this thesis, the impact of differentiation and scheduling of resources in the transport network on the end to end performance of voice over LTE is investigated. The results indicate that without proper prioritization and scheduling of resources in the transport network, the performance of voice is severely affected when the transport network is congested with data traffic. To overcome this scenario, we prioritize <b>voice</b> <b>over</b> <b>data</b> traffic and analyse its performance for different transport network scheduling algorithms. From the results, it is clear that with proper classification and scheduling of resources in the transport network, significant increase in voice capacity is observed. On the other hand, by totally prioritizing voice, performance of the data traffic is affected to a large extent. Hence, to achieve a balance, voice users are classified into different priority levels and the performance of voice and data in this scenario is investigated. The analysis for all these scenarios are based on simulations using OPNET simulation tool. Electrical EngineeringTelecommunicationsElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E
40|$|The {{area that}} this thesis covers is Voice over IP (or IP Telephony {{as it is}} {{sometimes}} called) over Private networks and not over the Internet. There is a distinction to be made between the two even though the term is loosely applied to both. IP Telephony over Private Networks involve calls made over private WANs using IP telephony protocols while IP Telephony over the Internet involve calls made over the public Internet using IP telephony protocols. Since the network is private, service is reliable because the network owner can control how resources are allocated to various applications, such as telephony services. The public Internet {{on the other hand}} is a public, largely unmanaged network that offers no reliable service guarantee. Calls placed over the Internet can be low in quality, but given the low price, some find this solution attractive. What started off as an Internet Revolution with free phone calls being offered to the general public using their multimedia computers has turned into a telecommunication revolution where enterprises are beginning to converge their data and voice networks into one network. In retrospect, an enterprise 2 ̆ 7 s data networks are being leveraged for telephony. The communication industry has come full circle.

40|$|Welcome to {{the fifteenth}} edition of Predictions for the Technology, Media and Telecommunications (TMT) sectors. The last 15 {{years have been}} a golden era for innovation: {{multiple}} TMT products and services that we now take for granted were niche or non-existent back then. In 2002, homes typically had dial-up Internet access, boxy television sets, wired speakers, standalone digital cameras, shopping catalogues and fixed line telephones. Photos were stored in albums and shelves bulged with CDs and DVDs; LPs had been banished to the attic or sold off. ‘Candy bar’ shaped mobile phones had monochrome screens and were predominantly used to make calls and exchange text messages. Instant messaging, e-mail, e-commerce, maps, search engines, photos, videos and other online services that are now routinely accessed via smartphones were predominantly PC-based {{at the start of}} 2002. 3 G networks had only just launched commercially, offering speeds of a few hundred kilobits per second. As most homes still had dial-up Internet, it was faster for most people to visit a video rental store, return home, watch the film, and then return it rather than to wait for a file to download. Over the last 15 years, connectivity has become steadily faster, enabling many new categories of service to become mainstream, including a number of current staple applications: search engines, social networks, video-on-demand, e- and m-commerce, app stores and online video games. These new services have driven the growing appeal of digital devices; smartphones and tablets being the two standout devices to have emerged over the period. These new device types have tended to complement rather than usurp existing products. While the past 15 years has witnessed startling change, it has also seen remarkable continuity. Broadcast television, radio, cinema, live entertainment, printed books and in-person meetings remain popular despite multiple digitally-enabled alternatives. 2016 promises to be yet another exciting year for the TMT sector. In this year’s edition we look at a fascinating array of trends, each developing at its own momentum. We look forward to the progress of cognitive technologies in enterprise software, to new approaches in accelerating mobile commerce check-out, and to the progression of graphene. We highlight the continuing strength of demand for the PC – especially among millennials. We welcome the commercial launch of virtual reality, and note the continued growth of both premium sports (with a focus on football in Europe), as well as the emerging eSports sector. We expect mobile should become the biggest games platform in 2016, overtaking console and PC. We observe that the key traditional media of television and cinema should continue to hold their own, even if not growing. We explore the current and near-term impact of ad-blockers on mobile advertising revenues.
