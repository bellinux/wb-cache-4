Compaction started in Summer 2006 at the east end of the Tube, on property belonging to the Port of Oakland.

40|$|IntroductionIschemic stroke (IS) is a {{frequent}} pathology, burdened by high rate of recurrence and significant morbidity and mortality. There are several causes of IS, affecting prognosis, outcomes and management, {{but in many cases}} the etiology remains undetermined despite comprehensive research. We hypothezised that atrial fibrillation (AF) was largely involved in this pathology but was underdiagnosed by standard methods. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the incidence of AF in cryptogenic IS, by using continuous monitoring of the heart rate over several months. The secondary objective was to test the predictive value of atrial <b>vulnerability</b> <b>study</b> towards spontaneous AF. Methods and resultsWe prospectively enrolled 24 patients under 75 years: 15 men and 9 women of mean age 48. 8 ± 13. 6 years who experienced cryptogenic IS presumed of cardioembolic mechanism within the last 4 months. Any cause of IS was excluded by normal 12 -lead ECG, 24 -hour Holter monitoring, echocardiography, cervical Doppler, haematological and inflammatory tests. All patients underwent electrophysiological study. 7 patients (29. 2 %) had inducible arrhythmia during programmed atrial stimulation and 9 (37. 5 %) had a latent vulnerability index (LVI) < 2. 5. Patients were secondarily implanted with an implantable loop recorder (ILR) (Medtronic™ Reveal Plus 9526) to look for spontaneous AF over a mean follow-up interval of 14. 5 months. No sustained arrhythmia was found. Only one patient had non significant AF access (< 30 s). In this patient, it was not triggered sustained arrhythmia but the LVI was low. ConclusionThis study shows that contrary to what was expected, AF does not appear to be a common pathology in patients under 75 years with unexplained IS. The use of ILR should not be generalized in the systematic assessment of these patients because of its unprofitability. Finally this study attests the poor value of atrial <b>vulnerability</b> <b>study</b> for predicting spontaneous AF in such patients...|$|E

These accelerograms, representative of different intensity levels, are then applied to the test setup. Three limit states (occupancy, damage and life safety limit state) are considered in this study to characterize the seismic response of suspended ceiling systems. The ceilings tested show no damage at all intensity level, resulting in a low fragility.

The regional recharge map adequately captured the magnitude and distribution compared to a local map constructed using HELP (42 mm/yr); However, regional recharge results were higher compared to a local map constructed using the MIKE-SHE code (6 mm/yr).

40|$|In a cross-disciplinary study, {{we carried}} out an {{extensive}} literature review to increase understanding of vulnerability indicators {{used in the}} disciplines of earthquake- and flood vulnerability assessments. We provide insights into potential improvements in both fields by identifying and comparing quantitative vulnerability indicators grouped into physical and social categories.

Earthquake vulnerability methods traditionally have a strong focus on object-based physical attributes used in vulnerability curve-based models, while flood <b>vulnerability</b> <b>studies</b> focus more on indicators applied to aggregated land-use classes in curve-based models. In assessing the differences and similarities between indicators used in earthquake and flood vulnerability models, we only include models that separately assess {{either of the two}} hazard types.

Furthermore, old buildings may have been altered repeatedly over time, may be founded on older buildings that got buried over and could be connected one to the others. This will cause dynamic interactions with other buildings or sub-structures during an earthquake. Therefore, {{the particular}} architectural and structural history of each structure adds uncertainties in the assessment of its seismic vulnerability. In this paper the dynamic response of CEDRAV building, part of the historical centre of Cerreto di Spoleto (Italy), is analyzed, by means of the data recorded by several temporary deployments of velocimeters. The complexity in assessing seismic behavior of the historical built environments is pointed out and so the dynamic interaction with adjacent buildings...|$|E
