40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis was aimed at developing the understanding of two regimes in vertical gas-liquid flow in tubes, namely annular flow and churn flow. In annular flow, there is a continuous gas passage at {{the centre of the}} pipe with a film of liquid travelling upwards at the wall. Part of the liquid phase in annular flow may be entrained as droplets in the core gas flow. In churn flow there is also a gas core (which the present work has shown to be continuous) and a liquid film; however, the flow direction of the liquid in this film varies with time. Thus, the liquid flows upwards in large waves {{on the surface of the}} film; between the waves, the film may change direction and flow downwards towards the next wave. Such flows are extremely complex and there are aspects of their behaviour which are poorly understood. In the work {{described in}} this thesis, several areas have been studied. Disturbance waves are of central importance in annular flows. Such waves are characterised by their large amplitudes relative to the mean film thickness, their high translation velocities relative to the mean film speed, and their circumferential coherence (i. e. their “ring-like” structure when fully developed). An important part of the present work was concerned with the existence, development and translation of disturbance waves in upwards, gas-liquid annular flows. At very low liquid flow rates, disturbance waves are not formed (and, as other work has shown, the entrainment of droplets from the liquid film is negligible). In the present work, multiple conductance probe units have been employed to study the growth and development of disturbance waves. From the results, it is found that disturbance waves begin to appear and to start to achieve their circumferential coherence from lengths as short as 5 – 10 pipe diameters downstream of the liquid injection location; this coherence gradually strengthens with increasing distance from the inlet. It is further shown that the spectral content of the entire interfacial wave activity shifts to lower frequencies with increasing axial 3 distance from the inlet, with the peak frequency levelling off after approximately 20 pipe diameters. Interestingly, on the other hand, the frequency of occurrence of the disturbance waves first increases away from the inlet as these waves form, reaches a maximum at a length between 7. 5 and 15 pipe diameters depending on the flow conditions, and then decreases again. This trend becomes increasingly evident at higher gas and/or liquid flow-rates. Both wave frequency measures increase monotonically at higher gas and/or liquid flowrates. Important evidence regarding the mechanisms of disturbance waves and the associated droplet entrainment can be obtained by the axial <b>view</b> <b>photography</b> technique. This technique is described in Chapters 3 and 6. The technique was used to visualise the wave characteristics, in particular of the two entrainment mechanisms (bag break up and ligament break up mechanisms) proposed previously by Azzopardi (1983). The axial <b>view</b> <b>photography</b> technique provided visual evidence for the existence of the two mechanisms, although in contrast to Azzopardi’s findings, both break up mechanisms were observed to occur simultaneously. The axial <b>view</b> <b>photography</b> technique was also used in the present work to provide further insights into the inception of disturbance waves. It was found that the initiation mechanism for disturbance waves was the occurrence of a disturbance at a given location around the tube periphery. This is consistent with the idea of a link between turbulent burst phenomena and disturbance waves first proposed by Azzopardi and Martin (1986). The initial disturbance links up with similar disturbances to ultimately form the characteristic ring-like structure characteristic of fully developed disturbance waves. In churn flow the present work concentrated on three aspects: The use of axial <b>view</b> <b>photography</b> to explore the continuity of the gas core in churn flow. The development (in collaboration with two other research students –Deng Peng and Masroor Ahmad) of a correlation for entrainment rate and hence entrained fraction in churn flow. Measurements of 4 pressure gradient and holdup in churn flow, from which an average wall shear stress can be deduced. In the first task, it was shown (it is believed for the first time) that there is a continuous path for the gas phase near the tube axis. In churn flow the behaviour of entrained fraction is extremely complex and conventional methods for measuring it are no longer valid. Barbosa etal (2002) studied entrainment in churn flow using iso-kinetic sampling probes and the correlation referred to above was based on this data. The correlation has been widely used in predicting the entrained fraction at the transition between churn and annular flow. Since the direction of flow of the liquid film near the channel wall fluctuates, it is difficult to estimate the instantaneous value of wall shear stress. However, if measurements are made of total pressure gradient and liquid holdup, then the mean value of wall shear stress can be estimated. This procedure was pursued by Govan (1990) who used mechanically operated quick-closing valves to measure holdup. In the current work, a new measurement technique was utilised, namely quick closing pinch valve which offer a great accuracy and are easy to install. Pressure gradient and hold up data were collected over a wide range of gas and liquid flowrate. An averaged wall shear stress was then calculated based on these measurements. At higher liquid mass flow rates, the results were in good qualitative agreement with those of Govan (1990) but (at lower mass fluxes) anomalies occur which need further investigation.

40|$|Scholars {{of nineteenth-century}} {{literature}} {{have been inspired}} by the multiplicity of connections that existed between writing and early photography. Critics have often argued that writers in Britain, America and elsewhere understood photography to be a profoundly realist practice, and as such that it stood as an analogue of literary realism. As this article demonstrates, such arguments have been enormously influenced by the Art History narrative of photography, as well as late twentieth-century poststructuralism. Roland Barthes' Camera Lucida has been particularly prominent. Yet though it has much to say about the phenomenology of posing, as well as the affective quality of images, Barthes' ‘modest book’ makes assumptions that have been problematized in subsequent photographic scholarship. These assumptions, which include indexicality and medium specificity, support an ideology of photographic realism. This ideology has dominated comparative studies of Victorian literature and early photography, including work on Thomas Hardy and Henry James. One result has been for literary critics to overlook the nuances of particular technologies, such as the daguerreotype, and to treat nineteenth-century photography {{as if it were a}} single medium. Another has been a privileging of modernism. This last result has been concomitant with a tendency for literary scholars to <b>view</b> <b>photography</b> solely as art. Important recent work in the history of photography has challenged the Art History narrative, but this has been slow to filter through to literary studies. This article will conclude by noting encouraging signs that this situation seems to be changing...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} work {{relating to}} the reflood phase of a Large Break Loss-of-Coolant Accident (LB-LOCA) in Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR). Three related types of experiment have been carried in this context, namely studies of particle motion in an annulus geometry simulating drop motion in a ballooned fuel element, studies of single phase flow in a 3 × 3 tube bundle simulating a ballooned fuel element and studies of reflooding of a hot tube {{in which it was}} possible to photograph the region above the rewetting front using axial <b>view</b> <b>photography.</b> In the particle tracking studies, Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) was used to determine typical particle tracks in an annulus test section in which the inner surface was ballooned to simulate the clad ballooning likely to occur during the reflood phase of an LB-LOCA. Excellent agreement was obtained between the measured particle tracks and ones calculated using the STAR-CD CFD code. The second set of experiments focussed on investigating the effect of pin ballooning on the vapour flow. An idealised, simulated PWR bundle containing a 3 × 3 rod arrangement with a central ballooned pin was designed and constructed and, using a novel isokinetic probe sampling technique, the axial deviation in mass flow of an outer sub-channel was measured. Again, good agreement was obtained between the flows measured and those calculated from the STAR-CD code. To further elucidate the rewetting process itself and the behaviour of the associated two-phase flow, an axial-viewing reflood (AVR) rig has been designed and constructed. Within this facility, experiments have been carried out to examine the thermal-hydraulic effects occurring during bottom-up reflooding of a single hot tube. A high-speed high-temperature axial viewing technique has been developed and applied to observe the quench front, and any precursory droplet production, deposition and entrainment ahead of the propagating quench front.

40|$|Tese de mestrado, Pintura, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Belas Artes, 2012 Photography being {{a recent}} form of {{expression}} has inherited {{a vast majority}} of its principles from painting. Although painters from the XIXth {{and the beginning of the}} XXth centuries mistrusted photography, it articulates and meets in painting the most part of its foundations. While, from the ‘technological’ point of <b>view,</b> <b>photography</b> has introduced other mediums, we wish to think over it as a mean of artistic expression deeply connected to painting from the perspective of its representation and composition processes and from the standpoint of the themes they address, such as the portrait. The portrait is, unquestionably, one of painting’s archetypes and it is obviously one of the most important heritages photography has received. We may ascertain that the importance of the portrait derives from the fact that the human being is built around a defining nest of affections; the portrait always shows itself as a replacement for the subject. Since the inception of photography in 1827 with Joseph Nicéphore Niépce, the “carte-de-visite”, being the basis for the portrait collections, was one of the first patented photographic processes, back in 1854 by André Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri. The importance of the portrait both in History and Art History is unquestionable. Because we are human beings, condemned by the limits of time, we hold an intrinsic desire to hold, preserve and try to retain what is not eternal; the others. Within the wide scope of portrait, the family portrait has been exploited the most by artists. This is the niche where the series Memória do Tempo wishes to fit. In light of the history of portrait in the two-dimensional surface of the picture, and relating to other artists’ work, we deeply analyse both formally and conceptually, the set of chosen photographs; specifically focusing the concepts of time, narration, series, double-representation, picture-in-picture, fragmented construction and self-representatio...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{work which}} {{was focused on}} stratifying annular flow in horizontal tubes. Stratifying-annular flows in horizontal tubes are characterized by the tube being wetted with liquid over its whole periphery but with a tendency {{for more of the}} liquid to be present in the layer {{at the bottom of the}} tube. For such a condition to exist, there have to be some mechanisms by which the liquid is transported at the top of the pipe in opposition to the influence of gravity. Such flows are typically experienced in hydrocarbon recovery and in many other applications as for instance in gas-condensate lines. Unless the liquid phase (to which a corrosion inhibitor is often added) can adequately wet the top of the pipe, corrosion and ultimate pipe failure may occur in this region; this is a crucial problem for the petroleum industry. Three physical mechanisms have been identified for the transport of the liquid phase to the top of the tube, namely: droplet transport, wave spreading and mixing, and secondary flow. The secondary flow mechanism seems unlikely to contribute significantly and the wave spreading mechanism is only significant in smaller diameter tubes (typically 25 mm). For larger pipes, it is the droplet transport mechanism which is likely to occur; in this mechanism, droplets are entrained from the liquid layer at the bottom of the pipe and transported in the gas core at the top where they deposit to form a liquid film. Two mechanisms of droplet transport seem to be significant, namely ballistic transport in which larger droplets move in a direction governed by their initial release velocity and diffusional transport in which droplets move randomly under the influence of the gas flow turbulence. For pipes of medium diameter (for example in the 78 mm diameter pipe used in the experiments described here), ballistic droplet transport is likely to be the dominant mechanism but diffusional transport is expected to be dominant for large diameter pipes. The work described in the thesis comprised both experimental and computational studies. In the experimental work, a special visualization method (namely axial <b>view</b> <b>photography)</b> was employed to study the droplet entrainment and transport mechanisms. The distribution of liquid film flow rate around the pipe was determined using a film extractor device. The axial viewing system was used to investigate droplet entrainment in stratifying-annular air-water flows in a 0. 078 m diameter horizontal pipe. The process of droplet entrainment was captured using a high speed cine camera. Both ligament and bag breakup mechanisms leading to droplet entrainment were identified. The creation of a ballistic droplet from a ligament was clearly observed. The film flow rate measurements were used in conjunction with previous measurements of droplet mass flux in the core in comparisons with a computational model which aimed to predict the transport of droplets using Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) modelling embodied in a commercial CFD code (CFX). In this model, the turbulent gas core was modelled and the motion of droplets emitted from the liquid layer at the bottom of the pipe was tracked in this turbulent field. Ultimately, the droplets are deposited on the tube wall and the film flow rate may be calculated using the predicted deposition rates as input data. The thesis closes with a description of a numerical experiment aimed at investigating the influence of the turbulence model on droplet transport. Specifically, comparisons were made between RANS and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models. [For supplementary files please contact author]. Imperial Users onl...|$|E
40|$|A pesquisa intitulada Fotografia: conversa com imagens, entre a luz e as trevas, tem por objetivo {{responder}} à questão: O que é e como se dão os modos de ver? Desse modo, a proposta é problematizar o que é o ver e os modos de ver, principalmente no tocante às imagens fotográficas, e propor novas possibilidades para perceber e relacionar-se com as imagens. O olhar dos artistas fotógrafos cegos Teco Barbero, Pete Eckert e Evgen Bavcar é o ponto de partida para articular conceituações, apontamentos, problematizações equestionar a convicção oculocentrista que pensa o mundo imagético como pertencente apenas aos videntes. A fundamentação teórica tem raízes nos estudos da cultura visual que corroboram para pensar o ver, a fotografia e a reflexão dos deficientes visuais viabilizada pelo campo, e discutir questões como imagem, sua produção e alguns possíveis modos de ver e se relacionar com as imagens. A fotografia é colocada em debate para avançar nas reflexões referentes aos modos de ver, perceber, criar e pensar o ver que vai além. E pensa a descrição e a língua como elementos articuladores para a relação dos deficientes visuais com a fotografia e imagens de modo geral. Ao adentrar no universo da língua, a tradução surge como possibilidade para refletir sobre os modos de construção das imagens fotográficas pelos deficientes visuais. A estruturação desse processo de pensar o ver, perceber e se relacionar com as imagens, é tecida a partir da poética do 'ver', 'rever' e 'transver', metáfora proposta por Manoel de Barros. Apoia-se também, nas possibilidades da tradução, de Vilém Flusser, adentrando o campo de estudos da cultura visual. Apesquisa de campo, observação e coleta de dados foi realizada com um grupo formado por deficientes visuais e bacharéis em fotografia do curso de extensão Alfabetização Visual, SENAC-SP, onde os alunos aprendem a fotografar e manusear a câmera, fazem exercícios de sensibilização, percepção e criação de imagens, além de debates e reflexões sobre a produção fotográfica e imagética. A investigação aponta, dentre outras questões, que o ver não é algo exclusivo do olho e que ele é construído a partir das vivências, experiências e, principalmente, das percepções oriundas dos sentidos. O ver é uma construção que se apoia na visão, e que se completa nas sensações, memórias e imaginação. Buscando ampliar a discussão sobre os modos de ver são apresentados os relatos, processos e trabalhos fotográficos de Lelo Araújo, Ana Domingues e Josias Neto. Análises e interpretações que abarquem a produção destes fotógrafos cegos não são tecidas, pois o intuito da pesquisa é refletir a respeito das possibilidades do ver em sua riqueza de formas e manifestações, com isso, ampliar o conhecimento sobre a imagem. The research entitled Photography: {{conversation with}} pictures, between light and darkness, aims {{to answer the}} question : What are the ways of seeing and how are they given? Thus, the proposal is to discuss what is the seeing and what are the ways of seeing, especially regarding images, and propose new possibilities to perceive and relate to the images. The look of blind photographers artists Teco Barbero, Pete Eckert and Evgen Bavcar is the starting point for articulating concepts, notes, contextualizing and question the oculocentrista beliefs that the world thinks the imagery as belonging only to the visionaries. The theoretical foundation is rooted {{in the study of the}} visual culture to think that corroborate the <b>view,</b> <b>photography</b> and reflection of visually impaired people enabled by the field, and discuss issues such as image, its production and some possible ways of seeing and relating to the images. The photograph is placed on debate to advance the reflection on the ways of seeing, perceiving, thinking and create the view beyond. And think the description and language as articulators for the visually impaired relationship with photography and images in general way. When entering the world of language, translation emerges as a possibility to reflect on ways of building the images for the visually impaired. The structure of the thinking process of the seeing, perceive and relate to the imaging, is woven from the poetics of 'see', ' review ' and ' transverse ' metaphor proposed by Manoel de Barros. Also relies, in the possibilities of translation, Flusser, entering the field of visual culture studies. The field research, observation and data collection was performed with a group of visually impaired and bachelors in travel photography Visual Literacy extension, Senac - SP, where students learn how to shoot and handle the camera, doing exercises to increase awareness, perception and imaging, as well as discussion and reflection on the photographic and image production. Research indicates, among other issues, that the seeing is not something unique of the eye and that it is built from the experiences, experiments, and especially the perceptions coming from the senses. The view is a construction that relies on vision, and is completed in sensations, memories and imagination. Seeking to expand the discussion on the ways of seeing, are listed the reports, processes and photographic works of Lelo Araújo, Ana Domingues and grandson Josiah. Analysis and interpretations that cover the production of these blind photographers are not woven, since the purpose of the research is to reflect upon the possibilities of seeing in its wealth of forms and manifestations, thus increasing the knowledge about the image...|$|E
