This study experimentally monitors the evolving microstructure network of very early-age cement paste during the setting period. The ultrasonic wave reflection method was applied to probe paste samples, which allows us to obtain the frequency dependence of mechanical impedance.

Three cement pastes (Portland cement type I) with different water-cement ratios (0. 35, 0. 50 and 0. 60) cured at 25 °C were examined. The ultrasonic shear wave reflection factor (WRF) {{was measured by the}} wave reflection technique. Reflection loss was calculated based on WRF measurement. Initial and final setting time were obtained by <b>Vicat</b> <b>Needle</b> <b>tests.</b> Thermogravimetric tests were conducted to observe the hydration process of cement pastes. To obtain the evolution of the microstructure in cement pastes, a numerical cement hydration model, HYMOSTRUC 3 D, was applied. Correlations between the microstructural evolution (e. g. growing of solid phases, percolation threshold of solid phases, and capillary porosity) calculated by HYMOSTRUC 3 D model and the reflection loss have been established.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{metastable}} tetragonal zirconia on {{the properties of}} Ordinary Portland Cement were observed during which the effect of crystallite size pH on the preparation solution, precursor salt, {{and the presence of}} co-precipitates, Fe(OH) 3, SnO 2 and SiO 2 on the crystallization temperature, enthalpy and crystal structure, immediately following the crystallization exothermic burst phenomenon in ZrO 2 were measured. Thermal analysis and x-ray methods were used to determine crystallite sizes and structures immediately following the exothermic burst. Comparisons were made for zirconias prepared from oxychloride, chloride and nitrate solutions. The existence of tetrameric hydroxidecontaining ions in oxychloride precursor is used to rationalise low values of crystallization enthalpy. The position of the crystallization temperature, Tmax was not dependent on crystallite size alone but also on the pH at which the gel was made, the surface pH after washing, and the presence of diluent oxides. Enthalpy v r 1 / 2 and Tmax v (diluent vol) 1 / 3 relationships indicate that surface coverage effects dominate a surface nucleated phenomenon. The data established for ZrO 2 systems was used to develop tetragonal-ZrO 2 -SnO 2 powders capable of improving the mechanical properties of Ordinary Portland Cement discs. The ZrO 2 -OPC discs were prepared by powder mixing, water hydration and uniaxial pressing. <b>Vicat</b> <b>needle</b> <b>tests</b> showed that tetragonal-ZrO 2 increases the initial setting rate.

40|$|While {{high volume}} fly ash (HVFA) {{concretes}} {{can be designed}} and produced to meet 28 -d strength requirements and often even exceed the durability performance of conventional concretes, a persistent problem is the potentially long delay in setting time that produces concurrently long delays in finishing the concrete in the field. Previous isothermal calorimetry studies on two different powder additions, namely calcium hydroxide and a rapid set cement, have shown that these powders can mitigate excessive retardation of the hydration reactions. In this paper, rheological measurements and conventional Vicat setting time studies are conducted to verify that these powder additions do indeed reduce setting times in paste systems based on both ASTM Class C and ASTM Class F fly ashes. The reductions depend on the class of fly ash and suggest that trial mixtures would be a necessity to apply these technologies to each specific fly ash/cement/admixture combination being employed in the field.

While the long term performance of these HVFA concretes typically meets or exceeds that of conventional concretes, their early age performance is often characterized by excessive retardation of the hydration reactions, delayed setting times, and low strengths. Extending an HVFA mixture to a ternary blend that incorporates a fine limestone powder may provide a viable solution to these deficiencies, particularly the hydration retardation and setting issues. In this paper, a nano-limestone powder and two other limestone fillers of increasing median particle size (4. 4 3 ̆bcm and 16. 4 3 ̆bcm) are investigated for their propensity to accelerate early age reactions and reduce setting times in a Class C fly ash/cement blend.

Evaluated properties for pastes and mortars include compressive strength {{and a variety of}} early-age properties that can influence cracking, specifically isothermal and semi-adiabatic calorimetry, chemical shrinkage, setting times (<b>Vicat</b> <b>needle)</b> and autogenous deformation. Addition of a high-range water reducer to the type III cement and the two finest blends is investigated as a secondary variable.

Fly ash (FA) and used cooking oil (UCO) are two waste products that could possibly be utilized for the same purpose as LS and raw LO. The use of these two materials in the preparation of putty was therefore investigated. Various mixtures of LS, FA, LO and CO (virgin and used) were prepared and kept under lab conditions or UV light. Virgin CO was acidified with conc HCl before being mixed with FA or LS. The addition of CaO (1 % m/m) as a possible catalyst was also investigated. It was found that temperature and UV radiation did not accelerate the hardening of the putty to a significant extent. Used and acidified cooking oil mixed with fly ash instead of limestone yielded putties comparable to the current commercial product. FT-IR spectroscopy was employed to follow the changes in the materials with the time. Spectra were recorded at different periods after mixing the samples and normalized on the carbonyl group band. However, no qualitative distinction between the two oils used for making up the putty mixtures could be achieved with the IR spectra.

The European Standard ‘EN 14488 - 2 : 2007 - Testing {{sprayed concrete}}. Part 2 : Compressive strength of young sprayed concrete' describes the indirect methods {{used to determine the}} compressive strength of the sprayed concrete at early ages. These are the penetration <b>needle</b> <b>test</b> and the stud driving method. The first one estimates the compressive strength until 1. 30 MPa evaluating a force gradually applied so that a needle penetrates a certain distance. The second one estimates the compressive strength evaluating the penetration of studs shoot with a certain power and the force to extract them. This second method cannot be performed until the compressive strength of the sprayed concrete is around 2. 50 - 3. 00 MPa. Therefore a range of strength cannot be estimated. This range entails certain time in which the estimation of the compressive strength of the sprayed concrete is not possible. This communication aims to present the problem related with the estimation of the compressive strength of the sprayed concrete at early ages. Furthermore, it objects to give a solution for this problem adapting the maturity method for the spraying concrete. In other words, it tries to solve the problem using the relationship between the compressive strength and the evolution of temperature during the hydration of cement. Therefore, a wide experimental program was performed testing specimens produced with different types of cement and types of accelerators. The results obtained present the impossibility to estimate a certain range of compressive strength using the penetration <b>needle</b> <b>test</b> and the stud driving method. Furthermore, the analysis of the experimental results allows adapting the maturity method for sprayed concrete. Therefore, the relationship between the compressive strength and the evolution of temperature, which depends on the type of cement and accelerator, can be used to estimate the compressive strength of the sprayed concrete at early ages.

50|$|The {{most recent}} North American case {{took place in}} 1994 in Los Angeles, CA, when a 39-year-old man {{presented}} an enlarging mass on his back. When doctors tried to operate a large intramuscular capsule was found. The surgery was terminated, and a fine <b>needle</b> aspiration <b>test</b> revealed muscular coenurosis. The man was treated with praziquantel. The drug successfully killed the larvae and his infection never returned. The cyst removed from this man {{is shown in the}} picture.|$|R
40|$|Mineral {{trioxide}} aggregate (MTA) is {{a modified}} Portland cement (PC) based dental material containing bismuth oxide (Bi 2 O 3) as a radiopacifier that is presently {{used as a}} sealing material in endodontic treatment. The present study investigated the influence of albumin, fibrinogen and γ-globulin, the three most abundant blood plasma proteins, both individually and in combination on the setting time, compressive strength and relative porosity of an MTA-like dental cement. The cement powder formulation was mixed with the liquid phase containing normal plasma protein concentrations or quarter, double or quadruple the normal plasma protein concentration {{as well as a}} mixture of all three proteins. Compressive strength and relative porosity were measured from 2 to 56 days and the initial setting times were determined using the Gilmore <b>needles</b> <b>test.</b> The set cement microstructure was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The compressive strength of all cements increased with time whereas strut density and relative porosity decreased. Fibrinogen and γ-globulin increased setting time with increasing concentration while albumin acted as an accelerant. For the MTA model mixed with all three plasma proteins, the setting times decreased as concentrations were increased...|$|R
