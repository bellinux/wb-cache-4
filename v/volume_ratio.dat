5|$|Due to this {{extremely}} thin membranous tissue, a bat's wing {{can significantly}} {{contribute to the}} organism's total gas exchange efficiency. Because of the high energy demand of flight, the bat's body meets those demands by exchanging gas through the patagium of the wing. When the bat has its wing in an open/spread out position it allows {{for an increase in}} surface area to <b>volume</b> <b>ratio.</b> The surface area of the wings is about 85% of the total body surface area, suggesting the possibility of a useful amount of gas exchange. The subcutaneous vessels in the membrane very close to the surface allow for the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacterial}} {{species are}} either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus, from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation {{is associated with}} swimming. Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface area to <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety of shapes {{is determined by the}} bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.|$|E
5|$|Sintering powders of {{samarium}} oxide and boron, in vacuum, {{yields a}} powder containing several samarium boride phases, and their <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> {{can be controlled}} through the mixing proportion. The powder can be converted into larger crystals of a certain samarium boride using arc melting or zone melting techniques, relying on the different melting/crystallization temperature of SmB6 (2580°C), SmB4 (about 2300°C) and SmB66 (2150°C). All these materials are hard, brittle, dark-gray solids with the hardness increasing with the boron content. Samarium diboride is too volatile to be produced with these methods and requires high pressure (about 65 kbar) and low temperatures between 1140 and 1240°C to stabilize its growth. Increasing the temperature results in the preferential formations of SmB6.|$|E

5|$|The {{second type}} of press design is the cubic press. A cubic press has six anvils which provide {{pressure}} simultaneously onto all faces of a cube-shaped volume. The first multi-anvil press design was a tetrahedral press, using four anvils to converge upon a tetrahedron-shaped volume. The cubic press was created shortly thereafter to increase the volume to which pressure could be applied. A cubic press is typically smaller than a belt press and can more rapidly achieve the pressure and temperature necessary to create synthetic diamond. However, cubic presses cannot be easily scaled up to larger volumes: the pressurized volume can be increased by using larger anvils, but this also increases the amount of force needed on the anvils {{to achieve the same}} pressure. An alternative is to decrease the surface area to <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> of the pressurized volume, by using more anvils to converge upon a higher-order platonic solid, such as a dodecahedron. However, such a press would be complex and difficult to manufacture.|$|E

In this present descriptive-analytical study, 122 subjects (46 males and 76 females), with an age range of 13 - 70 years, were evaluated.

25|$|Water {{regulation}} {{is an important}} aspect of centipede ecology, since they lose water rapidly in dry conditions and are found in moist microhabitats. Water loss is a result of centipedes lacking a waxy covering of their exoskeleton and excreting waste nitrogen as ammonia, which requires extra water. Centipedes deal with water loss through a variety of adaptations. Geophilomorphs lose water less rapidly than lithobiomorphs, though they have a greater surface area to <b>volume</b> <b>ratio.</b> This may be because geophilomorphs have a more heavily sclerotized pleural membrane. Spiracle shape, size, and ability to constrict also have an influence on rate of water loss. In addition, the number and size of coxal pores may be variables affecting centipede water balance.|$|E

The aragonite topography provides a high surface area to <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> and lacks edges, {{which leads to a}} reduction of the culture edge effect. Crystalline matrices such as the aragonite mentioned here are allowed for the promotion of a complex 3D tissue formation that approaches in vivo conditions.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the partitioning of rare-earth ions in polymer-based three-liquid-phase system (TLPS) of Cyanex 272 /PEG 6001 (NH 4) (2) SO 4 -H 2 O and the change in <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> of PEG-rich middle phase to salt-rich bottom phase was investigated. It {{was found that the}} change in phase <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> might be attributed to the transfer of hydrated PEG molecules. Therefore, the partitioning of hydrated PEG is a main driving force for the partitioning of rare earths. The change in water content in PEG-rich phase should be taken into account for calculating partition coefficients of rare-earth ions. The traditional Diamond-Hsu model derived from Flory-Huggins theory considered only the partitioning of simple PEG molecules to calculate the partition coefficients of targets in polymer-based aqueous biphasic system, so that it could not reflect such influences from the change in phase <b>volume</b> <b>ratios.</b> The present work discusses the influences from the change of the concentrations of PEG and inorganic salt, Cyanex 272 concentration in top organic phase of TLPS, aqueous pH value and initial concentration of rare-earth ions, on the partitioning of rare-earth ions into PEG-rich middle phase of TLPS.

Flows of such mixtures at velocities in excess of the local velocity of sound can produce shock phenomena similar to that experienced in supersonic gaseous media. A supersonic two-phase tunnel was designed and built with such versatility and precision that normal and oblique shock structures can be photographed and analyzed in the absence of boundary-layer interference. The applicability of the isothermal continuum theory to such flows is confirmed empirically for <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> near 1 : 1, and the theory is mathematically extended for both normal and oblique shocks over a wide range of <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> centered about the 1 : 1 value. Auxiliary flow devices were constructed for the measurement of such difficult flow parameters as the relative phase velocity, local void ratio, coefficient of friction, and stagnation pressure. A general change in the flow model matrix was found at <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> approaching 1 : 1. Pressure gradients and relative phase velocities were correlated with the proposed flow models with generally good agreement. The coefficient of friction measured for supersonic flow was found to be a simple function of the local void ratio.

At higher velocities, the stagnation pressure closely approaches the normal shock plus isentropic slowdown theory.

25|$|The {{simplicity}} of the Wankel engine makes it well-suited for mini, micro, and micro-mini engine designs. The Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) Rotary Engine Lab at the University of California, Berkeley, has previously undertaken research towards the development of Wankel engines of down to 1mm in diameter, with displacements less than 0.1cc. Materials include silicon and motive power includes compressed air. The goal of such research was to eventually develop an internal combustion engine {{with the ability to}} deliver 100 milliwatts of electrical power; with the engine itself serving as the rotor of the generator, with magnets built into the engine rotor itself. Development of the miniature Wankel engine stopped at UC Berkeley {{at the end of the}} DARPA contract. Miniature Wankel engines struggled to maintain compression due to sealing problems, similar to problems observed in the large scale versions. In addition, miniature engines suffer from an adverse surface to <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> causing excess heat losses; the relatively large surface area of the combustion chamber walls transfers away what little heat is generated in the small combustion volume resulting in quenching and low efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Type IV Portland cement is {{generally}} {{known for its}} low heat of hydration. Its typical compound composition is: 28% (C3S), 49% (C2S), 4% (C3A), 12% (C4AF), 1.8% MgO, 1.9% (SO3), 0.9% ignition loss, and 0.8% free CaO. The percentages of (C2S) and (C4AF) are relatively high and (C3S) and (C3A) are relatively low. A limitation on this type is that the maximum percentage of (C3A) is seven, and the maximum percentage of (C3S) is thirty-five. This causes the heat given off by the hydration reaction to develop at a slower rate. However, as a consequence {{the strength of the}} concrete develops slowly. After one or two years the strength is higher than the other types after full curing. This cement is used for very large concrete structures, such as dams, which have a low surface to <b>volume</b> <b>ratio.</b> This type of cement {{is generally}} not stocked by manufacturers, but some might consider a large special order.
