50|$|Therefore, Alfred Bucherer (1908) {{conducted}} a precise measurement using a <b>velocity</b> <b>filter</b> similar to Bestelmeyer's. See Figs. 3 & 5. A radium beta source was {{placed at the}} center of a circular condenser consisting of two silvered glass plates spaced 0.25 mm apart and charged to about 500 volts, set in a homogeneous 140 Gauss magnetic field. The radium emitted beta rays in all directions, but in any particular direction Î±, only those beta rays exited the <b>velocity</b> <b>filter</b> whose speed was such that the electric and magnetic fields exactly compensated each other. After leaving the condenser, the rays were deflected by the magnetic field, and exposed a photographic plate set parallel to the condenser rim and perpendicular to the non-deflected rays.|$|E
50|$|In {{geophysical}} applications sensors {{are used}} to measure and record the seismic signals. Many filtering techniques are available in which one output waveform is produced with a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the individual sensor recordings. <b>Velocity</b> <b>filters</b> are designed to remove interfering signals by exploiting {{the difference between the}} travelling velocities of desired seismic waveform and undesired interfering signals. In contrast to the one dimensional output produced by multi-channel <b>filtering,</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>filters</b> produce a two-dimensional output.|$|R

40|$|Motion {{detection}}, <b>velocity</b> <b>filtering</b> and {{the detection}} of change in a given scene are all important aspects for optical processing architectures and systems. So far several different techniques {{have been reported in}} the literature that use either all optical, or hybrid (optical plus electronic), schemes to implement novelty filter type operations. For essentially all-optical schemes the intrinsic advantages of parallel image subtraction arc clear.

50|$|The {{main problem}} of Kaufmann's {{experiments}} was {{his use of}} parallel magnetic and electric fields, as pointed out by Adolf Bestelmeyer (1907). Using a method based on perpendicular magnetic and electric fields (introduced by J. J. Thomson and further developed to a <b>velocity</b> <b>filter</b> by Wilhelm Wien), Bestelmeyer obtained considerably different values for the charge-to-mass ratio for cathode rays up to 0.3c. However, Bestelmeyer added that his experiment was not precise enough to provide a definite decision between the theories.|$|E
50|$|In 1907, Bestelmeyer {{questioned}} {{the accuracy of}} the measurements by Walter Kaufmann regarding the speed dependence of the electromagnetic mass. Bestelmeyer used a <b>velocity</b> <b>filter</b> for his own experiments on cathode rays, and this method was later also used by Alfred Bucherer. While Bucherer saw the results of his experiments as a confirmation of special relativity, his methods were criticized by Bestelmeyer, thus a polemical dispute between these two researchers arose. It took years until those problems could be resolved, and the results of further experiments confirmed the predictions of special relativity.|$|E

These systems are designed to detect small targets at long range and they often employ track-before-detect (TBD) strategies to integrate the target signal along consecutive frames. Jitter causes frame misalignment and leads to a reduction of the detection performance. We analyze the effects of jitter on the false alarm and detection probabilities and on the detection range. The analytical expressions here derived are a valuable tool both in the analysis and synthesis of IRST systems based on 3 -D <b>velocity</b> <b>filters...</b>|$|R
40|$|High fluxes of cold polar {{molecules}} are efficiently {{produced by}} electric guiding and <b>velocity</b> <b>filtering.</b> Here, we investigate {{different aspects of}} the beam formation.

A model taking into account velocity-dependent collisional losses of cold molecules in the region close to the nozzle accurately reproduces this behavior.

50|$|A Wien filter {{also known}} as {{velocity}} selector is a device consisting of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields {{that can be used}} as a <b>velocity</b> <b>filter</b> for charged particles, for example in electron microscopes and spectrometers. It is used in accelerator mass spectrometry to select particles based on their speed. The device is composed of orthogonal electric and magnetic fields, such that particles with the correct speed will be unaffected while other particles will be deflected. It is named for Wilhelm Wien who developed it in 1898 for the study of anode rays. It can be configured as a charged particle energy analyzer, monochromator, or mass spectrometer.|$|E
5000|$|Tandem {{time-of-flight}} (TOF/TOF) is a tandem {{mass spectrometry}} method where two time-of-flight mass spectrometers are used consecutively. To record {{full spectrum of}} precursor (parent) ions TOF/TOF operates in MS mode. In this mode, {{the energy of the}} pulse laser is chosen slightly above the onset of MALDI for specific matrix in use to ensure the compromise between an ion yield for all the parent ions and reduced fragmentation of the same ions. When operating in a tandem (MS/MS) mode, the laser energy is increased considerably above MALDI threshold. The first TOF mass spectrometer (basically, a flight tube which ends up with the timed ion selector) isolates precursor ions of choice using a <b>velocity</b> <b>filter,</b> typically, of a Bradbury-Nielsen type, and the second TOF-MS (that includes the post accelerator, flight tube, ion mirror, and the ion detector) analyzes the fragment ions. Fragment ions in MALDI TOF/TOF result from decay of precursor ions vibrationally excited above their dissociation level in MALDI source (post source decay [...] ). Additional ion fragmentation implemented in a high-energy collision cell may be added to the system to increase dissociation rate of vibrationally excited precursor ions. Some designs include precursor signal quenchers as a part of second TOF-MS to reduce the instant current load on the ion detector.|$|E

40|$|Electrostatic <b>velocity</b> <b>filtering</b> {{and guiding}} is an {{established}} technique to produce high fluxes of cold polar molecules. In this paper we clarify {{different aspects of}} this technique by comparing experiments to detailed calculations. In the experiment, we produce cold guided beams of the three water isotopologs H 2 O, D 2 O and HDO. Their different rotational constants and orientations of electric dipole moments lead to remarkably different Stark shift properties, despite the molecules being very similar in a chemical sense. Therefore, the signals of the guided water isotopologs differ on an absolute scale and also exhibit characteristic electrode voltage dependencies. We find excellent agreement between the relative guided fractions and voltage dependencies of the investigated isotopologs and predictions made by our theoretical model of electrostatic <b>velocity</b> <b>filtering.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 13 figures; small changes to the text, updated reference...|$|R

This <b>velocity</b> <b>filtering</b> effect allows the measurement of much smaller flow velocities (about 10 km/sec) than have heretofore been possible with hot plasma measurements.
