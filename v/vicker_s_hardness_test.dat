40|$|The {{purpose of}} this body of {{investigation}} {{is to examine the}} role of nanoscale and functionally-graded materials on the laser processing and performance of freeform parts and coatings. Both laser experiments and thermal transport models were utilized to achieve the end goal with applications targeted to dies, molds and light-weight aluminum structures. Specifically a computer-numerical-controlled, high-power CO 2 laser system with the aid of computer-aided-design models was used to study: (1) nanoscale material additive manufacturing (NAM) process where Ni-nanoparticles are dispersed in H 13 steel molten pool in layer-by-layer fashion to produce three-dimensional gear molds; (2) laser-cladding based freeform fabrication (LBFF) process where shaped beam and novel quasi co-axial powder delivery system were used to produce functionally graded H 13 /Ni-Cr/TiC mold inserts; and (3) laser sintering (LS) of nanocrystalline diamond powders on aluminum alloy substrate to form thick diamond-like carbon coatings for enhanced wear resistance.;In the NAM process, AISI H 13 steel micro-powder (70 - 100 mum), the standard material in the industry for dies and molds, was blended with Ni nano-powder (70 - 150 nm) in a volumetric ratio of 4 : 1 and then laser melted under conditions such that only H 13 powder was melted and solidified. With the aid of CAD/CAM models and layer-by-layer addition process, gear-shaped molds were fabricated, characterized and tested. Scanning electron microscopy, surface profilometry, Rockwell and Vicker 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>tests,</b> corrosion test and injection-molding test using polystyrene were used to evaluate the performance of Ni/H 13 molds. Results showed that nanoparticle dispersion has distinct improvements on the functional capability of H 13 steel molds to produce precision plastic parts; this is attributed to the role of nanoparticles in enhancing mechanical, chemical and tribological properties.;In the LBFF process, a hollow square-shaped, functionally-graded mold (FGM) insert was designed and built with additive layers of H 13 steel, Ni/Cr alloy and TiC using circular and rectangular beam profiles. Finite element numerical methods were applied to determine temperature fields and thermal gradients. The cooling rates were estimated and correlated with secondary dendrite arm spacing. Analysis and characterization of FGM insert revealed nearly full density mold with excellent integrity, favorable microstructures, strong interfaces and high hardness. Strength and dimensional stability of molds were tested in a thermal fatigue environment and compared with baseline H 13 steel. Improved strain tolerance, better crack resistance and higher oxidation resistance were the primary benefits of FGM mold.;In LS, nanocrystalline diamond powders (4 - 8 nm) were sprayed on 6061 aluminum alloy substrates to a nominal thickness of 25 mum by an electrostatic spray method and then laser sintered to consolidate and transform the diamond powder to diamond-like carbon (DLC) for a nominal thickness of 10 mum. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the presence of DLC coatings. Microhardness tests showed an average hardness of 2250 kg/mm 2 (some regions had a hardness of 9000 kg/mm 2) indicative of DLC. Fracture toughness and surface roughness were well within the typical ranges of DLC. Scanning electron microscope analysis revealed a near dense, fairly uniform coating with a flaw-free interface. Scratch tests indicated the ability of DLC coating to carry high loads without delamination. One-dimensional thermal energy transport models were formulated based on laser energy absorption, thermal properties of diamond and aluminum, heat conduction and convection and solved using finite element ANSYS code. Results guide to a hypothesis that laser sintering of nano-diamond powder takes place in solid state around 800 K followed by densification and phase transition to DLC and coating/substrate interface heating to nearly the melting temperature of aluminum.;The general findings of this study lead to the conclusion that laser processing of nanoparticles and functionally-graded materials is a prudent approach for not only manufacturing of high performance dies, molds and aluminum structures but also a means of offering the design flexibility in part geometry, tolerance and surface finish...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the hardness of a dental composite resin submitted to temperature changes before photo-activation with two light-curing unite (LCUs). Five samples (4 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness) for each group were made with pre-cure temperatures of 37, 54, and 60 A degrees C. The samples were photo-activated with a conventional quartz-tungsten-halogen (QTH) and blue LED LCUs during 40 <b>s.</b> The <b>hardness</b> <b>Vickers</b> <b>test</b> (VHN) was performed on the top and bottom surfaces of the samples. According to the interaction between light-curing unit and different pre-heating temperatures of composite resin, only the light-curing unit provided influences on the mean values of initial Vickers hardness. The light-curing unit based on blue LED showed hardness mean values more homogeneous between the top and bottom surfaces. The hardness mean values were not statistically significant difference for the pre-cure temperature used. According to these results, the pre-heating of the composite resin provide no influence on Vickers hardness mean values, however the blue LED showed a cure more homogeneous than QTH LCU.

50|$|The Meyer <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> is a {{rarely used}} <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> based upon {{projected}} area of an impression. This {{is a more}} fundamental measurement of hardness than other <b>hardness</b> <b>tests</b> {{which are based on}} the surface area of an indentation. The principle behind the test is that the mean pressure required to test the material is the measurement of the hardness of the material. The mean pressure is calculated by dividing the load by the projected area of the indentation. The result is called the Meyer hardness, which has units of megapascals (MPa).|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{sources of}} {{problems}} with a <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> machine that are detectable via day-to-day inspection using hardness standard blocks, or indirect verification, can be roughly divided into three: the indenter, the test force, and the indentation measuring apparatus. If any problems are detected, repair or recalibration of the testing machine, focusing on the aforementioned three factors, is carried out {{based on the results}} of verifying the direct accuracies of that machine. These efforts have been accumulated to acquire the high level of <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> technology as is available now.

40|$|<b>Hardness</b> <b>test</b> {{results provide}} a {{convenient}} and economical means of specifying material performance characteristics and {{are useful in}} quality control. Quantifiable <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> is at least 150 years old but, due to the complex deformation processes that occur during indentation, in many ways physical insights onthe test are still lacking. Finite element cedes can now accurately simulate complex, time-varying stress and strain states.
