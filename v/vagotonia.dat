The risk of death from nitrazepam therapy may be greater in younger patients (children below 3.4 years in the study) with intractable epilepsy.

40|$|Background—The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effect of the {{serotonin}} reuptake inhibitor paroxetine hydrochloride (Paxil, SmithKline Beecham) on cardiovascular reflexes. We hypothesized that Paxil prevents neurally mediated syncope (NMS) by attenuating the sympathoinhibition and <b>vagotonia</b> associated with a vasovagal reaction. Methods and Results—In a double-blind randomized study, 25 healthy subjects with a positive response to either carotid sinus massage (CSM) or lower body negative pressure (LBNP) received Paxil (20 mg/d) or placebo for 6 weeks. Arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), muscle sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), baroreflex control of SNA, blood pressure, and heart rate responses to CSM and LBNP were measured at baseline and at 6 weeks. Nineteen subjects completed the study (Paxil, n 9; placebo, n 10). In the Paxil group, BRS decreased significantly compared with baseline (15. 84. 0 ms/mm Hg versus 11. 02. 6 ms/mm Hg, P 0. 05); however, all 9 subjects continued to have a positive response to LBNP with presyncope. Paxil did not attenuate the sympathoinhibition or <b>vagotonia</b> associated with a positive LBNP response and had no significant effect on baroreflex control of SNA. In the control group, no significant change in BRS was noted compared with baseline. Seven out of 9 subjects who had a positive LBNP response at baseline had a repeat positive LBNP response, and the subject with a positive CSM at baseline had a negative response at 6 weeks.

There occurred an increase in the quantity of of birbic acid only in the group to which the extract of capsules had not been administered, and the cases in which the increase had occurred were all positive for Sawada 2 ̆ 7 s urinary test. The increase in the quantity of pyruvic acid excreted in the urine would, therefore, be attributed to <b>vagotonia.</b> (8) The changes in total protein and gamma globulin levels were most closely related to vitamin B_ 1 deficiency. (9) Of all the tests for liver function, Takada 2 ̆ 7 s test produced sesults which corresponded most closely to vitamin B_ 1 deficiency in total protein and gamma globulin levels. Significant difference in albumin fraction level and the ratio albumin/globulin between liver function disturbance and vitamin B_ 1 deficiency was found in the results of Takada 2 ̆ 7 s test alone,.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The baroreflex {{normally}} {{serves to}} buffer blood pressure against excessive rise or fall. Baroreflex failure occurs when afferent baroreceptive nerves or their central connections become impaired. In baroreflex failure, there is loss of buffering ability, and wide excursions of pressure {{and heart rate}} occur. Such excursions may derive from endogenous factors such as stress or drowsiness, which result in quite high and quite low pressures, respectively. They may also derive from exogenous factors such as drugs or environmental influences. METHODS AND RESULTS: Impairment of the baroreflex may produce an unusually broad spectrum of clinical presentations; with acute baroreflex failure, a hypertensive crisis {{is the most common}} presentation. Over succeeding days to weeks, or {{in the absence of an}} acute event, volatile hypertension with periods of hypotension occurs and may continue for many years, usually with some attenuation of pressor surges and greater prominence of depressor valleys during long-term follow-up. With incomplete loss of baroreflex afferents, a mild syndrome of orthostatic tachycardia or orthostatic intolerance may appear. Finally, if the baroreflex failure occurs without concomitant destruction of the parasympathetic efferent vagal fibers, a resting state may lead to malignant <b>vagotonia</b> with severe bradycardia and hypotension and episodes of sinus arrest. CONCLUSIONS: Although baroreflex failure is not the most common cause of the above conditions, correct differentiation from other cardiovascular disorders is important, because therapy of baroreflex failure requires specific strategies, which may lead to successful control...|$|E

40|$|Many older {{patients}} undergoing total {{intravenous anaesthesia}} (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil for surgical intervention take {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} inhibitors (ACEI) regularly because of hypertension or congestive heart failure.

Propofol causes hypotension via systemic vasodilatation and remifentanil can cause hypotension through activation of μ-receptors and central <b>vagotonia.</b> This study investigates whether long-term treatment with ACEI impairs the hemodynamic regulation during TIVA for minor surgery in older patients. In a prospective, two-armed observational study thirty six patients were studied. Seventeen were taking ACEI but no other antihypertensive medication regularly (ACEI group), nineteen patients without any antihypertensive medikation served as controls (non ACEI group). Hemodynamic variables were measured every minute during induction of anaesthesia and every five minutes during surgery. The plasma level of renin, angiotensin II, vasopressin, catecholamines and osmolality were measured before and ten minutes after induction of anaesthesia. Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly and to the same extent in both groups during induction of TIVA. There were also no differences between the groups regarding heart rate, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, as well as the use of vasoconstrictors and cristalloids during induction of TIVA and throughout surgery. In the ACEI group, the plasma renin concentration was greater at baseline and after induction of anaesthesia presumably due to the interruption of the negative renin-angiotensin feedback loop (p< 0, 05). Angiotensin II increased in the non ACEI group only (6, 2 ± 2, 2 pg/ml before vs. 9, 6 ± 3, 5 pg/ml after induction, p< 0, 05). In both groups plasma norepinephrine concentration decreased from circa 250 pg/ml before to circa 70 pg/ml after induction of TIVA (p< 0, 05). Plasma vasopressin and plasma epinephrine concentrations did not change in either group. Plasma osmolality was similar in both groups and remained unchanged ten minutes after induction of TIVA.

40|$|Background. Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) {{belongs to}} the most common inflammatory diseases of the joints, {{and the number of}} these patients is increasing everywhere causing enormous medical, social and economic damage. An important role in the pathogenesis of RA is given to the violations of the autonomic neural system (ANS) functions, whose condition is closely related to the rheological properties of the blood serum (RPBS). The purpose and objectives. To evaluate the correlation between «vegetative passport» of RA patients and autonomic dysfunction with RPBS at different variations of the disease. Materials and methods. We have examined 173 patients aged 18 to 79 years (on the average 46 years), among them 21 % were males and 79 % — females. The duration of disease manifestation was 10 years, type of RA seropositive for rheumatoid factor and citrulline antibodies was detected in 3 / 4 of cases, extraarticular (systemic) form of the disease was diagnosed in 37 % of cases. The surface indicators of the blood serum — viscosity, elasticity, tension, relaxation and viscoelasticity modulus — were determined using digital tensio­meter PAT 2 -Sinterface (Germany). Results. «Ve­getative passport» defines the integral clinical, laboratory and instrumental signs of RA, wherein the severity of autono­mic dysfunction is directly correlated with the rate of joint pathology progression, and in sympathicotonia — with the baseline parameters of rheumatoid factor in the blood and the degree of RA activity. Changes in RPBS are accompanied by an increase in the steady-state (static) surface tension, which are recorded in 70 % of cases. Integral state of interfacial activity, relaxation and viscoelastic characteristics of the blood determine the type of ANS and the presence of autonomic dysfunction in patients (patients with <b>vagotonia</b> are characterized by increase in viscoelastic modulus and decrease of surface tension, with sympathicotonia — by increase in surface tension and reduced surface viscosity). RPBS parameters are associated with the severity of autonomic disorders, and the surface viscosity index has a prognostic value. Conclusions. The development of autonomic dysfunction is correlated not only with the features of the course of articular syndrome and extraarticular RA symptoms, but also with the state of ANS, which is involved in RPBS disorders. In the future, the assessment of ANS state will be useful for subsequent timely rehabi­litation measures of the disease...|$|E
40|$|There are {{published}} many {{reports of the}} clinical tests of the autonomic nervous tonus. R. Exner (1948). emphasized that oxygen consumption and pulse rate vary with the correlation under the certain tonic states of the autonomic nervous system, moreover that, his method elucidates the autonomic tonicity from these two correlative values with special regards to in-, or decrease of body weight. As a rule, general sympathicotonia or <b>vagotonia</b> appears seldom in the clinical practice. The unsatisfactoriness of the tests hitherto in use depends upon that sympathico-, or parasympathicotropic hypertonus is rather confined to partial somatic symptoms or to functional states of several organs, {{and that there is}} usually found the intermingled condition of sympathico-, and parasympathicotonia. In order to investigate the clinical significance of Exner 2 ̆ 7 s test, author reexamined Exner 2 ̆ 7 s method and observed the influence of several autonomic agents upon the result of his test. Spirometer in the type of Benedict-Roth was used in this experiment as well as Exner 2 ̆ 7 s procedure. For the purpose to estimate oxygen consumption, the basal metabolism was determined with Knipping 2 ̆ 7 s apparatus. And the respiratory curves were analysed. Before the application of the autonomic agents according to Exner 2 ̆ 7 s proposal, the standard form (2 ̆ 2 Grundform 2 ̆ 2) was determined and thereafter studied the effects of the agents upon the patterns classified by Exner, moreover the fluctuation, of Manoiloff-Kroll reaction and of blood sugar and etc. were simultaneously examined. The types of the spirograms registered in 121 cases were devided into three. The 2 ̆ 2 irregular 2 ̆ 2 spirograms can be more frequently seen in patients suffered from essential and juvenile hypertension, hyperthyroidism, lastly functional cardiac diseases than in normal health. Fifty cases were classified into the standard forms according to Fxner 2 ̆ 7 s plan. Normal health and essential hypertension predominate in 2 ̆ 2 stenic normal 2 ̆ 2 form, hyperthyroidism in 2 ̆ 2 sympathicotropic 2 ̆ 2, functional cardiac diseases and hysteria in 2 ̆ 2 asthenic 2 ̆ 2, while 2 ̆ 2 parasympathicotropic 2 ̆ 2 is dominantly observed in various incretoric disorders, except for the 2 ̆ 2 undetermined 2 ̆ 2 form in 5 cases. Some corrections may be necessary as to the relationship pointed out by Exner between pulse rate and oxygen consumption; the reason can be explained as follows. (a) Normal pattern among 50 cases can be found only in one case suffered from pulmonary stenosis companied with palpitation as chief complain. As to pulse rate and basal metabolic value, 2 ̆ 2 sthenic normal 2 ̆ 2 pattern can be observed in 23 cases without tendency to decrease in body weight. So that, to speak strictly, it may not be classified to any group of patterns. (b) The interrelation between pulse and basal metabolic rates is studied on 288 cases. Both values run, in a certain extent, parallel with each other; however such cases are found lesser than those observed by Exner. (c) In organic heart diseases, pulse rates depend upon not only cardiac, but also extracardiac factors, consequently Exner 2 ̆ 7 s method can hardly be applied. (d) From the results of the responses to autonomic agents, it may be safe to say that both pulse and basal metabolic rates change almost indifferently from Exner 2 ̆ 7 s assumption. Responses to autonomic agents do not show a difinite characteristic correlation to the tonicity determined before the examination. (a) Norepinephrine, Priscol 2 ̆ 2 Ciba 2 ̆ 2, Reserpine (Serpasil 2 ̆ 2 Ciba 2 ̆ 2) and Deserpidine 2 ̆ 2 Ciba 2 ̆ 2 alter scarcely the patterns classified by Exner. (b) Atropine and Ansolysen 2 ̆ 2 Dai Nippon Seiyaku 2 ̆ 2 set up 2 ̆ 2 adynamic 2 ̆ 2 pattern accompanied with tachycardia. (c) Epinephrine elicites 2 ̆ 2 sympathicotropic 2 ̆ 2 type. (d) Chlorpromazine does not show a certain mode of response, nearly among a half of cases, but there occurs the slight decrease in basal metabolism. In hyperthyroidism, tachycardia as well as arrhythmia appear by means of this medication. (e) Mode of variation of either Manoiloff-Kroll 2 ̆ 7 s test or blood sugar does not always agree with that of results of Exner 2 ̆ 7 s test. So far as the limits above mentioned are considered into the interpretation of Exner 2 ̆ 7 s test, his method may be evaluated as one of the indication of the autonomic tonus at the given time-point...|$|E
