40|$|We have {{developed}} a noncontact method for measurement of the interline capacitance in Cu/low-k interconnect. It {{is based on a}} miniature test vehicle with net capacitance of a few femto-Farads formed by two 20 -μ m-long parallel wires (lines) with widths and spacings the same as those of the interconnect wires of interest. Each line is connected to a small test pad. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>impedance</b> is measured at 4 GHz by a near-field microwave probe with 10 μ m probe size via capacitive coupling of the probe to the vehicle's test pads. Full 3 D finite element modeling at 4 GHz confirms that the microwave radiation is concentrated between the two wires forming the vehicle. An analytical lumped element model and a short/open calibration approach have been proposed to extract the interline capacitance value from the measured data. We have validated the technique on several test vehicles made with copper and low-k dielectric on a 300 mm wafer. The vehicles interline spacing ranges from 0. 09 to 1 μ m and a copper line width is 0. 15 μ m. This is the first time a near-field scanning microwave microscope has been applied to measure the lumped element impedance of a test vehicle...|$|E

40|$|Epidemiological data {{suggests}} lower respiratory infections (LRI) with {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (RSV) {{are capable}} of causing long-term abnormalities in airway function. To directly test the effects of RSV LRI, we infected adult and weanling BALB/c mice with RSV (A 2) or <b>vehicle.</b> Respiratory system <b>impedance</b> {{was used to assess}} baseline airway function and responses to iv methacholine (MCh) at 4, 8, 24 and 34 weeks post infection. In vitro airway responses were measured 24 weeks post infection using electrical field stimulation and MCh. Mice infected as adults showed no alterations in airway function. Mice infected as weanlings had increased MCh responses 24 weeks post infection. However, the increased response was not present 34 weeks post infection nor accompanied by alterations in in vitro responses or airway morphometry. This study did not detect long-lasting changes in airway function following RSV infection in mice. These data do not provide support for alterations in airway structure or function being responsible for the observed relationship between RSV infection in infants and asthma in later life...|$|R
40|$|Battery {{impedance}} {{is essential}} to the management of lithium-ion batteries for electric <b>vehicles</b> (EVs), and <b>impedance</b> characterization can help to monitor and predict the battery states. Many studies have been undertaken to investigate impedance characterization and the factors that influence impedance. However, few studies regarding the influence of the internal temperature gradient, which is caused by heat generation during operation, have been presented. We have comprehensively studied the influence of the internal temperature gradient on impedance characterization and the modeling of battery impedance, and have proposed a discretization model to capture battery impedance characterization considering the temperature gradient. Several experiments, including experiments with artificial temperature gradients, are designed and implemented to study the influence of the internal temperature gradient on battery impedance. Based on the experimental results, the parameters of the non-linear impedance model are obtained, and the relationship between the parameters and temperature is further established. The experimental results show that the temperature gradient will influence battery impedance and the temperature distribution can be considered to be approximately linear. The verification results indicate that the proposed discretization model has a good performance and can be used to describe the actual characterization of the battery with an internal temperature gradient...|$|R
