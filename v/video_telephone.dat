40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an empirical study of the possibilities to use ISDN <b>video</b> <b>telephones</b> to support business communication. An informative brochure together with a questionaire was sent to about 650 private firms, public institutions, and government offices. In addition 46 extended interviews werde conducted in throughout the FRG. A total of 18 application cases for videotelephony werde identified. From these cased 8 application types werde derived. These were matched to different kinds of <b>video</b> <b>telephones</b> as possible alternatives to be developed. The study showed that the most important business application for <b>video</b> <b>telephones</b> would be to support the discussion of documents, drawings, pictures and small objects. Face-to-face communication was only partially of interest. There exists a broad interest in videotelephony, however high costs, reluctance against "being on TV", and lack of sufficient information may slow down the initial acceptance...|$|R

40|$|Various {{types of}} terminals, {{which may be}} used for videoconferencing, are {{discussed}} in terms of expenses and human factor requirements. It is shown that fairly simple station sets, e. g. <b>video</b> <b>telephones,</b> may be well suited for multipoint conferencing while providing continuous presence of all conferees in sound and picture. A look at network requirements results in search for 'information nodes', i. e. nodes within a network, where all the information from each of the conference sites is available. It is shown that networks using distributed switching are well suited for using centralized switching can and have to be adapted for multipoint applications. In multistar-configured networks the need for dynamic allocation of channel capacity between exchanges and distributed processing of audio and video information arises...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} a discrete wavelet transform for video intra frame coding in (mobile) <b>video</b> <b>telephones.</b> Present state-of-the-art wavelet codecs yield high-quality still pictures. However, these codecs are generally quite complex [1][2][3], whereas our work is influenced by the need for a low-complexity and low-cost hardware solution. In the context of hardware implementation and integration with the H. 263 low bitrate video standard [4], several bottlenecks are investigated, such as computational power and memory access bandwidth. Different solutions are proposed that make the discrete wavelet transform competitive with existing DCT intra frame coding schemes. An algorithm is developed that combines the Two-Ten wavelet transform with a Telenor block-based H. 263 run length and variable length encoder [5]. This algorithm is a low-complexity solution that yields good results in color image compression...|$|R
5000|$|In 1927, Ives {{demonstrated}} 185-line long-distance television, transmitting live video {{images of}} then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover via AT&T's experimental station 3XN in Whippany, New Jersey, allowing media reporters to both see {{and communicate with}} Hoover. By 1930, his two-way television-telephone system (called an ikonophone —Greek: 'image-sound' [...] ) was in regular experimental use. Bell Labs' large New York City research facility devoted years {{of research and development}} through the 1930s, led by Dr. Ives with his team of more than 200 scientists, engineers and technicians.

5000|$|This led to {{introduction}} of B-ISDN, {{by adding the}} word broadband. Although the term had a meaning in physics and engineering (similar to wideband), the CCITT defined it as: [...] "Qualifying a service or system requiring transmission channels capable of supporting rates greater than the primary rate" [...] referring to the primary rate which ranged from about 1.5 to 2 Mbit/s. Services envisioned included <b>video</b> <b>telephone</b> and video conferencing. Technical papers were published in early 1988. Standards were issued by the Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique (CCITT, now known as ITU-T), and called [...] "Recommendations". They included G.707 to G.709, and I.121 which defined the principal aspects of B-ISDN, with many others following through the 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|The special public {{videophone}} service was {{offered to the}} general public, which had to visit special post office Fernsehsprechstellen (<b>video</b> <b>telephone</b> booths, from [...] "far sight speech place") simultaneously in their respective cities, but which {{at the same time}} also had Nazi political and propagandistic overtones similar to the broadcasting of the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. The German post office announced ambitious plans to extend their public videophone network to Cologne, Frankfurt and Vienna, Austria, but expansion plans were discontinued in 1939 with the start of the Second World War. After Germany subsequently became fully engaged in the war its public videophone system was closed in 1940, with its expensive inter-city broadband cables converted to telegraphic message traffic and broadcast television service.|$|E
