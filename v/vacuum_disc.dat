50|$|The most {{important}} operating parameters of disc filters are {{the height of}} the slurry tank, agitation and the intensity and rotation speed of the disc as these will determine the cake formation and drying times. It is important to continuously agitate the slurry in order to prevent sedimentation of the solids. Excessively high agitation intensity may affect cake formation or change the particle size distribution of the product. One of the most commonly used agitators for filtration using <b>vacuum</b> <b>disc</b> filters is an oscillating cradle-type agitator located {{in the bottom of the}} basin, which requires fairly high rotation speeds to form homogeneous slurry. For processing rapidly settling high concentration slurries, bottom-feed rotary disc filters are usually used.|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} case of an 83 -year-old gentleman {{presenting}} with acute low back pain and radicular left lower extremity pain after golfing. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine revealed a low-signal-density lesion compressing the L 5 nerve. A computed tomography scan was then ordered, confirming an extra-foraminal disc protrusion at the L 5 –S 1 level, containing a focus of gas that was compressing the left L 5 nerve root and communicating with the <b>vacuum</b> <b>disc</b> at L 5 –S 1. After a failed left L 5 transforaminal epidural steroid injection, the patient was brought back for a percutaneous intradiscal aspiration of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>disc</b> gas. This resulted in immediate relief for the patient. A follow-up MRI performed 2  months after the procedure found an approximate 25 % reduction {{in the size of}} the <b>vacuum</b> <b>disc</b> herniation. Six months after the procedure, the patient remains free of radicular pain. This case report suggests that a percutaneous aspiration of gas from a <b>vacuum</b> <b>disc</b> herniation may assist in the treatment of radicular pain...|$|E
40|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>disc</b> {{phenomenon}} {{is a collection}} of gas in the intervertebral disc space but rarely causes nerve compression. Howe-ver, some rare type of vacuum phenomenon in the spinal canal may bring about posterior gas displacement within the epidural space. The authors describe two patients with symptomatic epidural gas-containing cyst that seem to be originating from vacuum phenomenon in the intervertebral disc, causing lumbosacral radiculopathy. Radiographic studies demonstrated intervertebral vacuum phenomenon and accumulation of gas in the lumbar epidural space compressing the dural sac and the nerve root. The nerve root in both patients was compressed by gas containing cyst that was surrounded by thin walled capsule separable from the gaseous degenerated disc space. The speculative mechanism of the nerve root compression is discussed. The possibility of gas containing cyst should be considered in case of the nerve root compression in which epidural gas is present.

40|$|Objective: Stenosis or herniated {{nucleus pulposus}} (HNP) occupying lumbar {{intracanal}} and foraminal area {{is an important}} cause of double radicular symptoms. Using the combined interlaminar and paraisthmic approach, we performed decompre-ssion surgery in patients with co-existing intracanal and foraminal lesions. The objective {{of this study is}} to describe usefulness and outcome of combined interlaminar and paraisthmic approach surgery and to analysis the cause of poor outcome. Methods: Between Apr 2009 and Apr 2014, 78 patients (42 males and 36 females) with intracanal and foraminal lesions were enrolled in this study. Patients with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>disc,</b> spondylolisthesis, instability or an isthmic defect on the preoperative dynamic view radiograph were excluded from this study. All patients underwent surgery through a combined approach for discectomy and decompression. The outcome of surgery was evaluated and classified into excellent, good, fair and poor. Results: The results were excellent in 53 patients, good in 9, fair in 6 and poor in 10 during the follow-up. The outcome of the combined approach was excellent to fair in 87 % (68 of 78) patients in our study. In the poor outcome group, three patients complained of early-onset relapsed pain ( 3 months). Conclusion: Combined approach for both intracanal and foraminal area lesions may be useful if selectively performed on patients whose facet joint is relatively intact, and that it is worthy of consideration as an alternative to fusion surgery; however...|$|E

50|$|The 3-litre P5 car {{introduced}} in September 1958 {{was in full}} production and the obsolescent P4 range was reduced to just two cars, this new four-cylinder 80, announced on 24 October 1959 and the Rover 100 announced at the same time. The 80 engine was a new Land Rover-derived straight-4 overhead-valve engine displacing 2.3 L, entirely different from the units used in all the other models. With 80 hp (59 kW) available, the car could top 85 mph (137 km/h). Girling 10.8 in <b>vacuum</b> servo-assisted <b>disc</b> brakes at the front were new, and the car used wider tyres and had updated styling.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the radiographic outcomes of short-segment posterior instrumentation plus vertebroplasty using injectable calcium sulfate cement (CSC) for thoracolumbar compression fractures. Materials and methodsTwenty-eight {{patients with a}} single-level thoracolumbar compression fracture, who underwent short-segment pedicle screw fixation and CSC vertebroplasty, {{were included in the}} study. The anterior vertebral body height ratio, local kyphosis angle, and the height of the intervertebral disc adjacent to the fractured vertebra were used to {{evaluate the}} radiographic results. Complications including bone nonunion, instrument failure, cement leakage, and <b>disc</b> <b>vacuum</b> formation were also assessed. ResultsThe patients were followed up for an average of 24. 20 ± 5. 40 months. The relative preoperative anterior body height was 55. 71 ± 15. 29 %, which improved to 94. 93 ± 5. 39 % immediately after surgery (P< 0. 001), and at final follow-up showed a 6. 50 ± 3. 89 % loss of height correction (P< 0. 001). The mean preoperative local kyphosis angle was 22. 23 ± 5. 65 °, which corrected to 2. 67 ± 4. 43 ° immediately after surgery (P< 0. 001), but reverted to 6. 71 ± 4. 95 ° at final follow-up, showing a 4. 04 ± 1. 91 ° loss of correction (P< 0. 001). The mean height of the intervertebral disc proximal to the fractured vertebra was 9. 87 ± 0. 91 mm before surgery, 12. 53 ± 0. 98 mm after operation (P< 0. 001), and the loss of correction at final follow-up was 2. 35 ± 1. 15 mm with a significant difference compared to immediate postoperative values (P< 0. 001). Bone nonunion occurred in 7 patients, 2 patients had hardware failure, 9 patients had cement leakage, and 10 patients had <b>disc</b> <b>vacuum</b> phenomenon adjacent to the fractured vertebra. ConclusionsThe patients who underwent this procedure had a loss of correction of vertebral height and local kyphosis. Complications such as bone nonunion, instrument failure, cement leakage, and <b>disc</b> <b>vacuum</b> may occur. Rapid CSC resorption accounts for these radiographic outcomes and complications.

50|$|In {{the copper}} disc seal, as {{proposed}} by W.G. Houskeeper, {{the end of a}} glass tube is closed by a round copper disc. An additional ring of glass {{on the opposite side of}} the disc increases the possible thickness of the disc to more than 0.3 mm. Best mechanical strength is obtained if both sides of the disc are fused to the same type of glass tube and both tubes are under <b>vacuum.</b> The <b>disc</b> seal is of special practical interest because it is a simple method to make a seal to low expansion borosilicate glass without the need of special tools or materials. The keys to success are proper borating, heating of the joint to a temperature as close to the melting point of the copper as possible and to slow down the cooling, at least by packing the assembly into glass wool while it is still red hot.|$|R
30|$|Comparative {{advantage}} {{has shifted}} significantly in these countries. Mexico has some unique advantages: {{it is the}} only developing country that borders the United States, plus {{it is part of the}} long-standing North American Free Trade Agreement. And yet, manufactures that had been produced and/or assembled in Mexico ten years ago – including telephones, PC monitors, transistors, <b>vacuums,</b> hard <b>discs,</b> and many others - are not made there any longer: most have moved to China (Carrillo, 2010). Mexican firms are succeeding with new products – avocados, for example. For its part, Brazil has faced the rise and fall of its furniture industry. Nowadays, Brazilian firms are succeeding with different new products: among them, jet aircraft, soybeans, and pork (Sabel et al., 2012). South Africa has become a major exporter of fruits and vegetables during the northern hemisphere’s winter season. The point is that comparative advantage changes, and for middle-income countries to succeed (and low-income countries too), they need to be prepared to change along with it.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} string disc amplitudes and D-brane higher derivative couplings. In the first part, we investigate all tree-level string theory <b>vacuum</b> to D-brane <b>disc</b> amplitudes involving an arbitrary RR-state and two NS-NS vertex operators. Our method is that, we develop an algorithm to derive the amplitudes in a manifestly gauge invariant and exchange invariant form, then we implement the algorithm on computer to systematically solve the amplitudes. In the second part, we derive the four-derivative brane interactions for one R-R field C^(p+ 5) and two NS-NS B-fields {{based on the}} amplitude from the first part. We find the effective coupling actually vanishes, which implies the interaction obeys a non-renormalization theorem...|$|R
40|$|We reconsider thin-disc global asymptotics for kinematic, {{axisymmetric}} mean-field dynamos with vacuum boundary conditions. Non-local terms {{arising from}} a small but finite radial field component at the disc surface are consistently taken into account for quadrupole modes. As in earlier approaches, the solution splits into a local part describing the field distribution along the vertical direction and a radial part describing the radial (global) variation of the eigenfunction. However, the radial part of the eigenfunction is now governed by an integro-differential equation whose kernel has a weak (logarithmic) singularity. The integral term arises from non-local interactions of magnetic fields at different radii through <b>vacuum</b> outside the <b>disc.</b> The non-local interaction can have a stronger effect on the solution than the local radial diffusion in a thin disc, however {{the effect of the}} integral term is still qualitatively similar to magnetic diffusion...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{an attempt}} to resolve the problem of poor clean coal quality and low ash content of tailing in the mixed {{flotation}} technology, factors affecting flotation performance were studied by orthogonal experiments, sieve analysis, progressive release flotation test and statistical methods. The classification flotation technology based on 0. 125 mm as the classification size was introduced, in which the key technology was the application of classification cyclone to separate the flotation feed.

5000|$|The discs pass, {{one at a}} time, {{into the}} metaliser, a small chamber at {{approximately}} 10−3 Torr (130 mPa) vacuum. The process is called 'sputtering'. The metaliser contains a metal [...] "target" [...] — almost always an alloy of (mostly) aluminium and small amounts of other metals. There is a load-lock system (similar to an airlock) so the process chamber can be kept at high <b>vacuum</b> as the <b>discs</b> are exchanged. When the disc is rotated into the processing position by a swivel arm in the vacuum chamber, a small dose of argon gas is injected into the process chamber and a 700 volt DC electric current at up to 20 kW {{is applied to the}} target. This produces a plasma from the target, and the plasma vapor is deposited onto the disc; it is an anode - cathode transfer. The metal coats the data side of the disc (upper surface), covering the pit and lands. This metal layer is the reflective surface which can be seen on the reverse (non label side) of a CD. This thin layer of metal is subject to corrosion from various contaminants and so is protected by a thin layer of lacquer.|$|R
