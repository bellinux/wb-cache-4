5000|$|The Catalan Talgo was an {{international}} express train introduced in 1969 that linked Geneva, Switzerland, with Barcelona, Spain. It {{was named after}} the Spanish region Catalonia and the Talgo equipment it used. It was an extension and upgrading of a predecessor train, Le Catalan, a first-class-only French (SNCF) Rapide train {{that had been in}} operation since 1955 but running only between Geneva and the stations nearest the Spanish-French border, connecting with a second-class-only [...] "autorail" [...] trainset to and from Barcelona. The national railway network of Spain, Red Nacional de los Ferrocarriles Españoles (RENFE), was using Iberian gauge for all of its main lines, while those of France and Switzerland use standard gauge. As a result of this break-of-gauge, train journeys between Geneva and Barcelona consisted of two separate parts, with travelers having to change from a French to a Spanish train or vice versa at the border—at Portbou (alternatively written as Port Bou) on southbound trains and at Cerbère on northbound trains. In 1968, this was resolved with the introduction of the Talgo III RD trainsets, which featured <b>variable</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>wheelsets.</b> At Portbou station, the wheel spacing of each passenger carriage was adjusted by a gauge changer for the difference in gauge, and passengers no longer had to change trains. After successful test runs, the Catalan was extended from Port Bou to Barcelona as a through train on 1 June 1969, becoming the Catalan Talgo and upgraded to a Trans Europ Express (TEE). Most other rail journeys through this border crossing continued to require a change of train at Cerbère station or at Port Bou, as most trains did not use Talgo III RD trainsets.|$|E
40|$|As {{a general}} rule, the multi-body {{simulation}} models used by railway vehicle designers consider the wheelsets {{to be fully}} rigid, thus leading to possible errors when calculating the critical {{speed of the vehicle}} under study. This article suggests a wheelset model that takes into account wheelset flexibility for the study of dynamic stability. The model is simple to implement, easily parameterised, and can be applied to both conventional and <b>variable</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>wheelsets.</b> The parameters corresponding to wheelset flexibility that most influence the critical speed of high-speed and variable gauge vehicles are also analysed.

40|$|The <b>variable</b> <b>gauge</b> {{rolling process}} is a new {{technology}} designed to produce flat products of different thicknesses such as longitudinal profile (LP) plates and tailor rolled blanks (TRB), which are used in bridge building, shipbuilding, and automobile manufacturing, etc., to decrease the weight and the welding times, etc. In this paper, a series of numerical studies on the wave motion of rolling force in <b>variable</b> <b>gauge</b> rolling (in three stages: down rolling, flat rolling, and upper rolling) were carried out using the finite element method to obtain the deformation of the work piece {{at different stages of}} rolling. The rolling force and its wave motion during rolling were analyzed under a variety of reduction ratios, including the coefficient of friction, initial thickness of the plates, and diameters of the rolls. The rolling force obviously increases as the reduction in the down rolling process increases, and then decreases during upper rolling. The rolling force consists of two abrupt wave motions in the transitional zones during the down to flat rolling stage, and the flat to upper rolling stage. These results are significant with regards to precisely controlling the deformation of workpiece in the transition zone during <b>variable</b> <b>gauge</b> rolling. The <b>variable</b> <b>gauge</b> rolling (VGR) {{process is a}} new technology designed to produce flat products of different thicknesses. In VGR process, the rolling force consists of two abrupt wave motions in the transitional zones during the down to flat rolling stage, and the flat to upper rolling stage, which are significant with regards to precisely controlling the deformation of workpiece...|$|R
