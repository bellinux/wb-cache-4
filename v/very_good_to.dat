500|$|According to Beatles biographer Nicholas Schaffner, Harrison's Revolver {{compositions}} – [...] "Taxman", {{which opened}} the album, the Indian music-styled [...] "Love You To", and [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] – established {{him as a}} songwriter within the band. Recalling the release in the 2004 edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Rob Sheffield said that Revolver displayed a diversity of emotions and styles ranging from the Beatles' [...] "prettiest music" [...] to [...] "their scariest", among which [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] represented the band at [...] "their friendliest". Commenting on the unprecedented inclusion of three of his songs on a Beatles album, Harrison told Melody Maker in 1966 that he felt disadvantaged in not having a collaborator, as Lennon and McCartney were to one another. He added: [...] "when you're competing against John and Paul, {{you have to be}} <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> even get in the same league." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Harry Shearer criticized what he {{perceived}} as the show's declining quality: [...] "I rate {{the last three seasons}} as among the worst, so season four looks <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> me now." [...] Dan Castellaneta responded: [...] "I don't agree,... I think Harry's issue is that the show isn't as grounded {{as it was in the}} first three or four seasons, that it's gotten crazy or a little more madcap. I think it organically changes to stay fresh." [...] Also in 2004 author Douglas Coupland described claims of declining quality in the series as [...] "hogwash", saying [...] "The Simpsons hasn't fumbled the ball in fourteen years, it's hardly likely to fumble it now." [...] In an April 2006 interview, Groening said: [...] "I honestly don't see any end in sight. I think it's possible that the show will become too financially cumbersome... but right now, the show is creatively, I think, as good or better than it's ever been. The animation is incredibly detailed and imaginative, and the stories do things that we haven't done before. So creatively there's no reason to quit." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} cast for their hamming and {{effective}} delivery of what Bennion called the [...] "stilted, stagy dialogue"; Toby Dantzic, writing for The Telegraph Saturday Review, called the acting [...] "stellar". The {{attention to detail}} by {{the cast and crew}} was widely praised; the [...] "dated styling" [...] was, for Jackson, [...] "spot on". Louisa Mellor, of the entertainment website Den of Geek, explained that [...] "from the aspect ratio to the music, title font, sets, lighting, camera moves, hair, make-up and costume... everything was recognisable from the sort of 1970s television plays that, when you think about it, may have provided inspiration for Inside No. 9 as a whole". For her, [...] "the retro send-up provided enough entertainment on its own—these days you have to be <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> make TV that bad". White, similarly, argued that [...] "it's a gargantuan, incredibly precise task to make such gloriously terrible TV, a skill reserved for only the greatest of comics". Even despite the flaws of the film within the episode, Rebecca Nicholson, of theguardian.com, found it [...] "relatively gripping". Sarah Hughes, writing in i, compared [...] "The Devil of Christmas" [...] to an episode of Tales of the Unexpected; it was she, argued, [...] "both an immaculately conceived homage to Roald Dahl's original anthology series and a worthy contender for its crown".|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Shearer criticized what he {{perceived}} as the show's declining quality: [...] "I rate {{the last three seasons}} as among the worst, so season four looks <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> me now." [...] Shearer has also been vocal about [...] "The Principal and the Pauper" [...] (season nine, 1997) {{one of the most controversial}} episodes of The Simpsons. Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that Principal Seymour Skinner, a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by both Shearer and Groening. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, [...] "That's so wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters. It's so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it's disrespectful to the audience." [...] Due to scheduling and availability conflicts, Shearer decided not to participate in The Simpsons Ride, which opened in 2008, so none of his characters have vocal parts and many do not appear in the ride at all. In a 2010 interview on The Howard Stern Show, Shearer alluded that the reason he was not part of the ride was because he would not be getting paid for it.|$|E
