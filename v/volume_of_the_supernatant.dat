30|$|For the {{isolation}} using the RNAqueous-Micro Kit, Lysis Solution (300  μl) from the kit was added onto one BM smear slide, and scraped using a clean cell scraper. For another BM smear slide, we repeated the procedure. The lysate (total 600  μl from two BM smear slides) was incubated at 42 °C for 30  minutes, {{and then the}} supernatant by centrifugation was collected. Fifteen μl of LCM Additive from the kit {{was added to the}} supernatant (500  μl) and the solution was vigorously mixed, and then ethanol (1.25 -times <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant)</b> was added with mixing.

After washing the cartridge with Wash Solution 1 and 2 / 3, 10  μl of an elution solution heated at 95 °C was added to the column, and 5  minutes later the desired solution was recovered.

These kits include GenSolve (Cat.# WB 100050, BTC Private Limited) (Richard et al. 2011; Phyo et al. 2012), forensicGEM (Cat.# 95044 - 090, Zygem Corporation) (Moss et al. 2003), DNA IQ (Cat.# DC 6700, Promega) (Barbaro et al. 2004; Rohland and Hofreiter 2007), and DNAzol (DN 131, MRC Inc) (Chomczynski et al. 1997; Mackey et al. 1998; Chomczynski et al. 1998; Haak et al. 2009; Turner et al. 2011; Knowles et al. 2012). DN 131 is a commonly used reagent for blood paper card DNA isolation because its protocol is straightforward, and the supernatant with blood paper card post centrifugation {{can be directly}} used for amplification of targeted genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> cannot exceed 10 % of the total PCR volume when DN 131 kit is utilized. In addition, DNA isolated by DN 131 includes excess proteins, which will further dampen efficiency of PCR amplification. Previously our team had used Tris–HCl (10  mM, pH 7.4) and achieved a high success rate for mouse genotyping (Sysol et al. 2013). We therefore hypothesized that DNA dissolving solutions including Tris–HCl, TE or water may be feasible for blood paper card DNA isolation.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{comprised}} of two parts. The first part {{is dedicated to the}} literature search, overview, which is focuses on the summary of information that was previously found not only about the life and reproduction of freshwater bryozoan Pectinatella magnifica, but also the importance of marine species bryozoans. Furthermore, importance of antimicrobial active substances and most commonly used laboratory methods for determination of microbial activity are shown in the report characteristics. The aim of the review was to summarize the most important facts underlying the experimental hypothesis described {{in the second part of}} this work. The reason for testing the antimicrobial activity of symbiotic bacteria isolated from Pectinatella magnifica is that antimicrobial activity of symbiotic bacteria and also bryozoans´ extracts were demonstrated in the marine bryozoans. Because of this, deeper knowledge of these largely unknown animals has become of high importance. Bacteria isolated from Pectinatella magnifica colonies collected in 2012 and 2013 in South Bohemia were tested for their antimicrobial aktivity against many strains of bacteria. Diffusion method was chosen for testing of the antimicrobial activity. Instead of application by paper disks, method using holes into solid agar was used. Into these holes, precisely selected <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> of bacterial isolates has been dosed. In total, 170 supernatants were tested against 80 strains of bacteria. In the case of supernatant containing antimicrobial substances produced by the tested bacteria, an inhibition zone around the hole would be created. The antimicrobial activity has been confirmed in three cases while testing supernatant of symbiotic bacteria Aeromonas veronii and Pseudomonas moraviensis against strains of clostridia. Furthermore, it has also been confirmed, that Aeromonas veronii inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas moraviensis. In the remaining studied isolates, antimicrobial activity suppressing the growth of test bacteria has not been confirmed...|$|E

Proteins and polymers were precipitated by adding <b>the</b> same <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> acetonitrile to <b>the</b> plasma fraction. To separate proteins and polymer from plasma water, the samples were centrifuged at 1700 ×g for 3  min. <b>The</b> <b>supernatants</b> were weighed followed by determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> activity in a γ-counter. <b>The</b> percentage <b>of</b> radioactivity in <b>the</b> blood cells, protein plus polymers, and plasma water fractions was calculated by subtracting <b>the</b> activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatants</b> from <b>the</b> activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole blood sample.|$|R
40|$|A {{bacterial}} strain {{which could be}} grown in a medium containing organic solvents and which could secrete lipolytic enzyme was isolated. <b>The</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lipolytic activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> culture increased significantly in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> organic solvents such as toluene, cyclohexane, ethanol, and acetone...|$|R
30|$|The model {{wastewater}} containing {{soluble starch}} was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and {{chemical oxygen demand}} (COD) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> was measured. <b>The</b> decrease in COD <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model wastewater containing soluble starch was used to express <b>the</b> capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> yeast to treat the wastewater.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{antimicrobial}} agent existed in <b>the</b> cell free <b>supernatant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bacterial isolate S 33 was investigated through three step procedure {{in the current}} study. The first test included boiling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell <b>supernatant</b> at 100  °C for 10  min. The second test involved incubation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> with protease K at 55  °C for 30  min. Whilst, the last test encompassed <b>the</b> incorporation <b>of</b> FeCl 3 (at a final concentration of 100  µM) in <b>the</b> agar plate <b>of</b> E. amylovora strain EGY 1 DSM 101800 prior employing this plate in the well cut diffusion test (mentioned below).|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> level <b>of</b> {{lipid peroxidation}} was {{measured}} in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> TBA-reactive substances (TBARS) (Heath and Packer 1968). Fresh leaf samples (0.5 g) were homogenized in 10 mL of 0.1 % trichloro-acetic acid (TCA). The homogenate was centrifuged at 15 000 ×g for 5 min. About 2 mL <b>of</b> aliquot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> was mixed with 4 mL of 0.5 % TBA in 20 % TCA. The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 30 min, and then quickly cooled in an ice bath. After centrifugation at 10 000 ×g for 10 min to remove suspended turbidity, <b>the</b> absorbance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> was recorded at 532 nm. The value for nonspecific absorption at 600 nm was subtracted. The TBARS content was calculated using its absorption coefficient of 155 ·mmol- 1 ·cm- 1.|$|R
40|$|In two {{clinical}} situations {{associated with}} hyperfibrinolysis <b>the</b> administration <b>of</b> antifibrinolytic drugs resulted in clinical haemostasis. The dilute clot lysis time and fibrin plate activity test {{but not the}} euglobulin lysis time reflected this control of excessive fibrinolysis by the antifibrinolytic drugs. The inhibition by epsilon-amino-caproic acid (EACA) of hyperfibrinolysis induced in vitro was reflected by the dilute clot lysis time but not by the euglobulin lysis time. Paper chromatography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> and euglobulin fractions as prepared for the euglobulin lysis time test from plasma with added EACA demonstrated that some 85 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EACA was present in <b>the</b> <b>supernatant,</b> normally discarded during the test. Similarly, cellulose-acetate electrophoresis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> and euglobulin fractions from plasma containing Trasylol demonstrated the drug in <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> only. These findings indicate that when acetic acid is added to plasma containing EACA or Trasylol only a small proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug is precipitated with the euglobulin fraction. The euglobulin lysis time is thus an inaccurate index <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neutralization <b>of</b> hyperfibrinolysis by antifibrinolytic drugs...|$|R
