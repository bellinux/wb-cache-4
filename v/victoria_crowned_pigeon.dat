50|$|The <b>Victoria</b> <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> is now {{the most}} rarely {{occurring}} of the three crowned pigeon species in the wild, although {{it is the most}} widely kept species in captivity. Perhaps the most pressing threat to the species is continuing habitat loss due to logging. It now quite uncommon near human habitations because it is heavily hunted around them, particularly in areas where gun possession is prevalent. It can be quite tame and easily shot, though now seems to be fearful of humans in the wild. Most hunting is for its plumes and meat. Trapping of pigeons to be kept alive for captive collections is now illegal, but is still likely to be occurring. The <b>Victoria</b> <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> is evaluated as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed in Appendix II of CITES.|$|E

500|$|Collectively, the/a crest. Long crest {{feathers}} {{are sometimes}} called quill feathers. Also defined herewith: recumbent crests and recursive crests. A type of [...] feather {{with a long}} [...] with [...] on either side, that often presents as a prominent tuft on the [...] and (or through) the neck and upper [...] Birds with crests include <b>Victoria</b> <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeons,</b> northern lapwings, macaroni penguins and others, but the most recognizable are cockatoos and cockatiels, which can raise or lower their crests at will {{and use them to}} communicate with fellow members of their species, or as a form of defence to frighten away other species that approach too closely, making the bird appear larger when the crest is suddenly and unexpectedly raised. In some species the position of the crest is a threat signal {{that can be used to}} predict behaviour. In Steller's jays, for example, a raised crest indicates a likelihood of attack, and a lowered crest indicates a likelihood of retreat. Crests can be recumbent or recursive, depending on the species. The recumbent crest, such as in white cockatoos, has feathers that are straight and lie down essentially flat on the head until fanned out. The recursive crest, such as in sulphur-crested cockatoos and Major Mitchell's cockatoos, is noticeable even when its feathers are not fanned out because they curve upward at the tips even when lying flat, and when standing up, often bend slightly forward toward the front of the head. Some birds, like galahs and rose-breasted cockatoos, have modified crests that have both recumbent and recursive features.|$|R
50|$|The western <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon,</b> {{also known}} as the common <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> or blue <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Goura cristata) is a large, blue-grey pigeon with blue lacy crests over the head and dark blue mask {{feathers}} around its eyes. Both sexes are almost similar but males are often larger than females. It is on average 70 cm (28 in) long and weighs 2,100 grams (4.6 lbs).|$|R
50|$|Like other <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeons,</b> {{this species}} makes a loud {{clapping}} sound when it takes flight. The mating calls {{of this species}} are also similar {{to the other two}} species of <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeons,</b> consisting of a deep hoota-hoota-hoota-hoota-hoota sound. When defending their territories, these birds make a resounding whup-up, whup-up, whup-up call. Their contact call is a deep, muffled, and rather human-like ummm or hmmm.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Victoria</b> <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> is {{distributed}} in the lowland and swamp forests of northern New Guinea and surrounding islands. It usually occurs on areas that were former alluvial plains, including sago forests. Though typically found at or near sea level, occasionally birds of this species may venture up in the hills to an elevation up to about 3,000 feet.They fly from sea to tree every day.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Victoria</b> <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Goura victoria) is a large, bluish-grey pigeon with elegant blue lace-like crests, maroon breast, and red irises. It {{is part of}} a genus {{of three}} unique, very large, ground-dwelling pigeons native to the New Guinea region. The bird may be easily {{recognized}} by the unique white tips on its crests and by its deep 'whooping' sounds made while calling. Its name commemorates the British monarch Queen Victoria.|$|E

50|$|Along {{with its}} close and very similar-looking {{relatives}} the <b>Victoria</b> <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{and the southern}} crowned pigeon, {{it is one of}} the largest and is considered one of the most beautiful members of the pigeon family. The western crowned pigeon is found in and is endemic to the lowland rainforests of Papua, Indonesia section of New Guinea; the other species of crowned pigeon inhabit different regions of the island. The diet consists mainly of fruits and seeds.|$|E
50|$|The two {{subspecies}} of the <b>Victoria</b> <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon</b> are G. v. beccarii {{found on}} the mainland of New Guinea and G. v. victoria, the nominate race, {{found on the}} islands of Yapen, Biak and Supiori. The nominate subspecies is markedly smaller, with a wing chord measurement of 31.6 - 33.2 cm, with less robust legs and feet and darker overall plumage. The nominate has a sparser crest with black on the wing coverts and right above the tail.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{subspecies}} of {{the southern}} crowned pigeon, differentiated by their shoulder and belly colorations. Goura scheepmakeri sclateri of southwest New Guinea with maroon shoulders and blue-grey belly, and the nominate race Goura scheepmakeri scheepmakeri of southeast New Guinea with blue-grey shoulders and maroon below. It also looks very similar to its relatives, the <b>Victoria</b> <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeon,</b> and the western crowned pigeon.This species was first discovered new to science by Otto Finsch who found a live bird received from the dealer C. Scheepmaker in Amsterdam Zoo and named it after him.|$|E

The achievement is inspired by the frontispiece of a pamphlet entitled [...] "De Papoea’s roepen Nederland" [...] (The Papua’s call for the Netherlands) published in 1951.|$|E
50|$|The {{phylogeny}} of the <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeons</b> is {{not well}} resolved. Several molecular analyses have been conducted (e.g. Johnson &, 2000), with one (Shapiro et al., 2002) suggesting that along with the Nicobar pigeon and the tooth-billed pigeon of Samoa, the three Goura pigeons belong {{to a group of}} which the unfortunate dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire are an offshoot lineage, but depending on which genetic sequence is analyzed, the placement of the <b>crowned</b> <b>pigeons</b> differs. They might belong to the fruit-dove subfamily Treroninae, but usually they are treated as a subfamily of their own, the Gourinae.|$|R
