5|$|In September 1943, Italy capitulated {{and signed}} an Armistice with the Allies. Littorio was then renamed Italia. The three active battleships were {{transferred}} to Malta before {{they were to be}} interned in Alexandria. While en route to Malta, German bombers attacked the fleet with Fritz X radio-guided bombs, damaging Italia and sinking Roma. Nevertheless, Italia and Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> reached Malta and were interned. The incomplete Impero was seized by the Germans after Italy withdrew from the war and used as a target, until she was sunk by American bombers in 1945. Italia and Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> were awarded to the United States and Britain, respectively, as war prizes. Italia, Vittorio <b>Veneto,</b> and Impero were broken up for scrap between 1952 and 1954.|$|E
5|$|Laid down {{nearly four}} years after Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> and Littorio, Roma was able to {{incorporate}} a few design improvements. Her bow was noticeably redesigned to give Roma additional freeboard; partway into construction, it was modified {{on the basis of}} experience with Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> so that it had had a finer end at the waterline. She was also equipped with thirty-two rather than twenty-four /65 caliber Breda guns.|$|E
5|$|Later in the day, Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> and Pola were torpedoed by British aircraft, {{the latter}} left immobilized. Trento, Trieste, and Bolzano were also {{attacked}} by aircraft, but they escaped without damage. Trento reached Taranto in {{company with the}} damaged Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> at 15:30 the following day. In the meantime, Pola and two other Zara-class cruisers were destroyed in the night action with British battleships late on the 28th.|$|E

According to the staff, 2.36 million Venetians (63.2% of all eligible voters) participated in the online referendum and 89.1% of them (that is to say 56.6% of all eligible voters) voted yes. This was enough for Busato and his followers to proclaim <b>Veneto's</b> independence from Italy in Treviso {{on the night of}} 21 March.

The referendum is not executive and a final decision on the matter can only be taken by law of the Italian parliament with consent of both regional councils of <b>Veneto</b> and Trentino-Alto Adige.|$|E
5|$|Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> {{remained}} in Malta until 14 September, {{when she and}} Italia were moved to Alexandria, Egypt {{and then to the}} Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal on 17 October. The two battleships remained there until 6 October 1946, when they were permitted to return to Italy. Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> went to Augusta, Sicily before moving to La Spezia on 14 October. In the Treaty of Peace with Italy, signed on 10 February 1947, Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> was allocated as a war prize to Britain. She was paid off on 3 January 1948, stricken from the naval register on 1 February, and subsequently broken up for scrap. Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> had been the most active Italian battleship of the war, having participated in eleven offensive operations. Twelve 90mm anti-aircraft guns taken from Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> were reused by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) as armament of its Žirje Island coastal artillery battery. The battery surrendered without resistance to the Croatian National Guard on 14 September 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence, and played a pivotal role in 1622 September Battle of Šibenik, helping defend the city of Šibenik against the JNA.|$|E

5|$|The keels for Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> and Littorio {{were laid}} on the same day, 28 October 1934, at the Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico {{shipyard}} in Trieste and the Ansaldo shipyard in Genoa, respectively. Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> was launched on 22 July 1937, with Littorio following exactly one month later on 22 August. While incomplete, Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> went to sea on 23 October 1939 to conduct machinery trials. She was delivered to the Italian Navy in Trieste, still incomplete, some six months later on 28 April 1940. She departed Trieste on 1 May for final fitting out at the dockyard in La Spezia. After completion on 15 May 1940, she went to Taranto to join the fleet.

5|$|Cunningham, {{realising}} that an {{air attack}} could weaken the Italians, ordered {{an attack by}} the Formidables Albacore torpedo-bombers.

5|$|Italia and Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> reached Malta, {{where they}} {{remained}} until 14 September, {{when they were}} transferred to Alexandria.

On 6 June 1946, Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> steamed to Augusta in Sicily, where, under the Treaty of Peace with Italy, she was allocated to Britain. On 14 October 1946, she was moved to La Spezia, paid off on 3 January 1948, and broken up for scrap. Italia left Great Bitter Lake on 5 February 1947, to join her sister in Augusta. Allocated to the United States, she was stricken on 1 June 1948 and scrapped in La Spezia. The incomplete Impero had meanwhile been seized by the retreating Germans in 1943, who used her as a target, until she was sunk by American bombers on 20 February 1945. In October 1947, the ship was raised and towed to Venice, where she was broken up.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} ships, Littorio and Vittorio <b>Veneto,</b> were {{operational}} {{by the early}} months of Italy's participation in World War II. They formed the backbone of the Italian fleet, and conducted several sorties into the Mediterranean to intercept British convoys, though without any notable success. The two ships were repeatedly torpedoed throughout their careers: Littorio was hit by a torpedo during the attack on Taranto in November 1940 and again in June 1942 and Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> was torpedoed during the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941 and while escorting a convoy to North Africa in September 1941. Roma joined the fleet in June 1942, though all three ships remained inactive in La Spezia until June 1943, when all three were damaged in a series of Allied air attacks on the harbor.|$|E

5|$|Italia and Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> {{were then}} moved, first to Alexandria, Egypt, {{and then to}} the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal in Egypt on 14 September; they {{remained}} there {{until the end of the}} war. On 5 February 1947, Italia was finally permitted to return to Italy.

5|$|On 14 June, Littorio {{participated in}} the {{interception}} of the Operation Vigorous convoy to Malta from Alexandria. Littorio, Vittorio <b>Veneto,</b> four cruisers and twelve destroyers were sent to attack the convoy. The British quickly located the approaching Italian fleet and launched several air strikes early on 15 June with Wellington and Bristol Beaufort bombers {{in an attempt to}} prevent them from reaching the convoy. The aircraft scored no hits on the battleships, but they did disable the cruiser , which was later sunk by a British submarine. Later that morning another air attack, this time B-24 Liberators from the USAAF, occurred. The high-level bombers scored one hit on Littorio and several near misses around her and Vittorio <b>Veneto,</b> but neither ship was seriously damaged. Another British strike with Beauforts arrived shortly thereafter, but Italian and German fighters had since arrived and they shot down two Beauforts and damaged five others. By the afternoon, Iachino had concluded that he would not reach the convoy before dark, and so he broke off the operation. On the return voyage, another British air attack succeeded in torpedoing Littoiro.|$|E
5|$|Repairs to Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> were {{completed}} {{in time for}} her to join Littorio on attacks on the convoys Vigorous and Harpoon, which had departed Alexandria and Gibraltar to reinforce Malta simultaneously in mid-June. Combat was limited to the opposing light forces, and Littorio and Vittorio <b>Veneto</b> did not see action; the British nevertheless broke off Operation Vigorous due to the ships' presence and heavy air attacks. While returning to port, Littorio was hit by a bomb from an American B-24 Liberator heavy bomber; the bomb struck the forward gun turret, though it did minimal damage. Before returning to port, a British Wellington bomber torpedoed the ship. The torpedo struck her starboard bow, though she returned to port. Repairs {{were completed}} and on 12 December, both ships were moved from Taranto to La Spezia in response to the Allied landings in North Africa. Roma joined the fleet shortly after the attacks on the two convoys, and joined her sisters for the move to La Spezia. There, she replaced Littorio as the fleet flagship.|$|E

50|$|Under Austrian rule, <b>Veneto's</b> agriculturally based economy suffered, {{which later}} led to mass emigration.
