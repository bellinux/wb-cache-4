50|$|Epipactis purpurata (<b>Violet</b> <b>Helleborine)</b> is an orchid {{found in}} France, the United Kingdom, Slovenia and Serbia.|$|E
50|$|The scarce <b>violet</b> <b>helleborine</b> orchid {{is found}} in small {{quantities}} in the woodland along the north edge of the first pond {{to the west of}} the main lake.|$|E
50|$|These woods have ash, {{lime and}} sessile oak, {{together}} with wild service-trees, {{which is an}} indicator of ancient woodland. The ground flora is very rich, including locally unusual plants such as lily-of-the-valley, wood spurge, great wood-rush, <b>violet</b> <b>helleborine</b> and columbine.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a remnant}} of the ancient Royal Forest of Rockingham, and it has broadleaved {{woodland}} and semi-natural grassland. The most common trees are pedunculate oak, ash, sycamore and downy birch. Locally uncommon flowering plants include woodruff, <b>violet</b> <b>helleborine</b> and fly orchid.|$|E
50|$|As {{characteristic}} of all orchids, Epipactis spp. {{are dependent on}} a mycorrhizal symbiosis (see also Orchid mycorrhiza). This allows some species to have reduced leaves and need little chlorophyll. <b>Violet</b> <b>Helleborine</b> (Epipactis viridiflora) can even do without chlorophyll. These forms can be recognized by their purple instead of violet flowers.|$|E
50|$|Fuller {{information}} {{is available from the}} Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust nature reserves handbook. Typical woodland flowers include bluebell, wood anemone, early-purple orchid, primrose, ramsons (wood garlic), common dog-violet and yellow archangel. Uncommon species are meadow saffron, herb-paris, common cow-wheat, bitter-vetch and <b>violet</b> <b>helleborine.</b> The grassy rides support betony, devil's-bit scabious, saw-wort, common spotted-orchid, greater knapweed, greater butterfly-orchid, cowslip and yellow-rattle. The damper rides supports lesser spearwort, ragged-robin, marsh ragwort, brooklime and various sedges and rushes.|$|E
50|$|The Common {{is noted}} for its wild flowers, with {{thriving}} communities of yellow archangel (Galeobdolon luteum), wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides) and wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa). Spurge-laurel (Daphne laureola) is sparsely but widely distributed. The Common {{is also home to}} such interesting species as stinking hellebore (Helleborus foetidus), green hellebore (H. viridis ssp. occidentalis), bird's nest orchid (Neottia nidus-avis), <b>violet</b> <b>helleborine</b> (Epipactis purpurata), the extreme rarity E. x schulzei (first British record here, 1931), and green-flowered helleborine (E. phyllanthes).|$|E
50|$|Gorse (Ulex europaeus), {{silver birch}} (Betula pendula), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) are {{scattered}} across the heath, in places forming extensive areas of secondary woodland and scrub. Older woodlands consist of beech (Fagus sylvatica) and sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa). These contain bluebell (Hyacinthinoides non-scripta), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), hard fern (Blechnum spicant) and honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum) with birds-nest orchid (Neottia nidus-avis) and <b>violet</b> <b>helleborine</b> (Epipactis purpurata) found particularly under beech. In the woodlands {{can also be found}} wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and common wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella).|$|E
40|$|In the 1992 and 1993 {{vegetation}} seasons, investigations {{were carried}} out {{on the distribution of}} plants from the orchid family in the area roughly corresponding to the Wyżyna Częstochowska (Częstochowa Upland) mesoregion (341. 31 in the classification of Kondracki 1980). During those investigations, sites of occurrence were found for 22 species, 5 interspecific hybrids and 1 intergeneric hybrid. Of special interest are the sites of Russow’s Marsh Orchid (Dactybrhiza russowii), <b>Violet</b> <b>Helleborine</b> (Epipaclis purpurata) and Greater Butterfly Orchid (flatanihera chloraniha) as well as of aJl the nothotaxa, which have never been found in this area before.
