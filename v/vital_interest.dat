During the 1970s and 1980s, he was a major critic of the renewed arms race as détente was ended.|$|E

The urgent need, doubts about the British engineering workload and slow progress, prompted the US to start investigating designs for a Navy bombe, based on the full blueprints and wiring diagrams received by US Naval Lieutenants Robert Ely and Joseph Eachus at Bletchley Park in July 1942. Funding for a full, $2 million, navy development effort was requested on 3 September 1942 and approved the following day.|$|E

Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in Lawrence, ruling that Texas’s state sodomy law was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process clause (adult consensual sexual intimacy in one’s home is a <b>vital</b> <b>interest</b> in liberty and privacy protected by the Due Process Clause).

2500|$|Fearing that a Hohenzollern king in Prussia {{and another}} one in Spain would put France into a two-front situation, France this time was {{determined}} {{to stand up to}} the expansion of Prussian influence. Napoleon III at this time was suffering the most unbearable pain from his stones, and the Empress Eugénie essentially was charged with countering the designs of Prussia. She had a <b>vital</b> <b>interest</b> in the crisis as she was of Spanish blood and a member of the royal line. The secretary of foreign affairs, Duc Antoine de Gramont, was directed by the Empress to be the principal instrument by which France would press for war should Leopold ascend the throne. Gramont delivered a speech in front of the Chambre législative, proclaiming that [...] "We shall know how to fulfill our duty without hesitation and without weakness." [...] The fatal mistake would soon come as a result of Gramont's inexperience, for he counted on alliances that only existed in his mind.|$|E
