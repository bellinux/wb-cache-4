40|$|A {{software}} interface has been devised to facilitate optimization of {{the shapes of}} <b>valves,</b> <b>elbows,</b> fittings, and other components used to handle fluids under extreme conditions. This {{software interface}} translates data files generated by PLOT 3 D (a NASA grid-based plotting-and- data-display program) and by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software into a format in which the files can be read by Sculptor, which is a shape-deformation- and-optimization program. Sculptor enables the user to interactively, smoothly, and arbitrarily deform the surfaces and volumes in two- and three-dimensional CFD models. Sculptor also includes design-optimization algorithms {{that can be used}} in conjunction with the arbitrary-shape-deformation components to perform automatic shape optimization. In the optimization process, the output of the CFD software is used as feedback while the optimizer strives to satisfy design criteria that could include, for example, improved values of pressure loss, velocity, flow quality, mass flow, etc...|$|R
40|$|A {{dental unit}} water line (DUWL) {{equipped}} with a device designed to automatically and continually flush a bacteriostatic solution of hydrogen peroxide (WHE) and a discontinuous disinfecting system (BIOSTER) was evaluated. In the first instance a preliminary sensitivity test on {{a large number of}} microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) was tried with a H 2 O 2 range from 100 to 800 ppm. The bacteria frequently reported in DUWL (including Pseudomonas spp, Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., E. coli) and some periodontal pathogens showed a minimum inhibitory concentration from 100 to 300 H 2 O 2 ppm (also including M. marinum and C. albicans). However, H 2 O 2 did not show any inhibitory effects against: A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. glabrata C. parapsilos, F. nucleatum, M. micros. In a second step, the DUWL was experimentally infected with S. faecalis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus. After disinfection steps with 3 % H 2 O 2, the inhibitory effect on planktonic forms and on sessile biofilm was measured. In a third step, the count of 16 S rRNA gene copies by real time PCR at different points of the DUWL described an accrue of bacterial slime in “hot spot” regions characterized by irregular/slow water flux (<b>valves,</b> <b>elbows).</b> However these results suggest that hydrogen peroxide is not only able to inhibit bursts of planktonic bacteria inside the DUWL, but that it could also be effective against sessile biofilm containing heterotrophic microorganisms derived from domestic water line contamination. In addition some oral pathogens could be contaminating and surviving in DUWL...|$|R
50|$|Pressure drop {{is defined}} as the {{difference}} in total pressure between two points of a fluid carrying network. Pressure drop occurs when frictional forces, caused by the resistance to flow, act on a fluid as it flows through the tube. The main determinants of resistance to fluid flow are fluid velocity through the pipe and fluid viscosity. Pressure drop increases proportional to the frictional shear forces within the piping network. A piping network containing a high relative roughness rating as well as many pipe fittings and joints, tube convergence, divergence, turns, surface roughness and other physical properties will affect the pressure drop. High flow velocities and / or high fluid viscosities result in a larger pressure drop across a section of pipe or a <b>valve</b> or <b>elbow.</b> Low velocity will result in lower or no pressure drop.|$|R
40|$|This report calculates {{the effect}} of the conductances of the pumping lines on the pumping speeds of the vacuum pumps being used to pump the inner vessel, and annular space, vacuum tight during the CC Cryostat testing. Effective pumping speeds were {{calculated}} for various values of pressure via the above stated formulas (see calculations). Conductances of <b>valves,</b> <b>elbows,</b> and tees were calculated with the help of ref. 1, and the volumes of the inner vessel and annular space were calculated wtth the aid of ref. 2. The major results of these calculations follow. The attached graphs show the effective pumping speed vs. pressure, as well as the pressure vs. pumpdown time for both the inner vessel pumpdown and the annular space pumpdown. Many intervals of pressure were chosen in order to give a complete picture of the effects on the pumping speed, and pumpdown time. An important rule of thumb is that the effective pumping speed be close to the intrinsic pump speed in the region of interest for the best efficiency. With an infinite conductance, these quantities become equal. In the case of the annular space pumpdown. the effective pumping speed is within approximately 15 % of the intrinsic pump speed for pressures down to 6000 {mu}, and at that point, the conductance effects slow the system down and provide a 49 % difference at 1000 {mu}. To Improve these numbers, the line length must be shortened, or even better, the line diameter increased. As far as pumpdown time is concerned, the actual pumpdown was completed in a reasonable amount of time, and would have been even better if the pumping system did not lag due to a leaK and its repair time. The inner vessel pumpdown shows a pumpdown time near 1 hour to reach 100 {mu} pressure. The effective pumping speed matches to within 10 % of the intrinsic pump speed to 6000 {mu}, and then the conductance effects become more important and provide a 41 % difference at 1000 {mu}. The actual pumpdown was completed in a reasonable amount of time which demonstrates that the pump used was in fact adequate for this application...|$|R
50|$|Installation effects such as {{insufficient}} straight pipe, exceptional pipe roughness or smoothness, <b>elbows,</b> <b>valves,</b> tees and reducers {{causes the}} flow conditions within the pipe to vary from the reference conditions. How these installation effects impact the meter {{is very important}} since devices which create upstream installation effects are common components of any standard metering design. Flow Conditioning refers {{to the process of}} artificially generating a reference, fully developed flow profile and is essential to enable accurate measurement while maintaining a cost-competitive meter standard design. The meter calibration factors are valid only of geometric and dynamic similarity exists between the metering and calibration conditions. In fluid mechanics, this is commonly referred to as the Law of Similarity.|$|R
40|$|Development of good {{predictive}} {{models for}} jet noise {{has always been}} plagued by the difficulty in obtaining good quality data {{over a wide range}} of conditions in different facilities. We consider such issues very carefully in selecting data to be used in developing our model. Flight effects are of critical importance, and none of the means of determining them are without significant problems. Free-jet flight simulation facilities are very useful, and can provide meaningful data so long as they can be analytically transformed to the flight frame of reference. In this report we show that different methodologies used by NASA and industry to perform this transformation produce very different results, especially in the rear quadrant; this compels us to rely largely on static data to develop our model, but we show reasonable agreement with simulated flight data when these transformation issues are considered. A persistent problem in obtaining good quality data is noise generated in the experimental facility upstream of the test nozzle: <b>valves,</b> <b>elbows,</b> obstructions, and especially the combustor can contribute significant noise, and much of this noise is of a broadband nature, easily confused with jet noise. Muffling of these sources is costly in terms of size as well as expense, and it is particularly difficult in flight simulation facilities, where compactness of hardware is very important, as discussed by Viswanathan (Ref. 13). We feel that the effects of jet density on jet mixing noise may have been somewhat obscured by these problems, leading to the variable density exponent used in most jet noise prediction procedures including our own. We investigate this issue, applying Occam s razor, (e. g., Ref. 14), in a search for the simplest physically meaningful model that adequately describes the observed phenomena. In a similar vein, we see no reason to reject the Lighthill approach; it provides a very solid basis upon which to build a predictive procedure, as we believe we demonstrate in this report. Another feature of our approach is that the analyses are all conducted with lossless spectra, rather than Standard Day spectra, as is often done in industry. We feel {{that it is important to}} isolate the effects of as many physical processes as practical. Atmospheric attenuation can then be included using the relations developed for NASA by Shields and Bass (Ref. 15), which are available in both FOOTPR and ANOPP. The current approach to coannular jet noise prediction used in FOOTPR is reported in Reference 16, which updates the earlier conventional-velocity-profile (CVP, Ref. 17) and inverted-velocity-profile (IVP, Ref. 18) models...|$|R
40|$|Noise {{tests of}} NASA Lewis Research Center's Powered Lift Facility (PLF) were {{performed}} to determine the frequency content of the internally generated noise that reaches the far field. The sources of the internally generated noise are the burner, <b>elbows,</b> <b>valves,</b> and flow turbulence. Tests over a range of nozzle pressure ratios from 1. 2 to 3. 5 using coherence analysis revealed that low frequency noise below 1200 Hz is transmitted through the nozzle. Broad banded peaks at 240 and 640 Hz {{were found in the}} transmitted noise. Aeroacoustic excitation effects are possible in this frequency range. The internal noise creates a noise floor that limits the amount of jet noise suppression that can be measured on the PLF and similar facilities...|$|R
40|$|A steady {{incompressible}} three-dimensional {{viscous flow}} analysis {{has been conducted}} for the Space Shuttle External Tank/Orbiter propellant feed line disconnect flapper <b>valves</b> with upstream <b>elbows.</b> The full Navier-Stokes code, INS 3 D, is modified to handle interior obstacles. Grids are generated by SVTGD 3 D code. Two dimensional initial grids in the flow cross section with and without the flappers are improved by elliptic smoothing to provide better orthogonality, clustering and smoothness to the three dimensional grid. The flow solver is tested for stability and convergence {{in the presence of}} interior flappers. An under-relaxation scheme has been incorporated to improve the solution stability. Important flow characteristics such as secondary flows, recirculation, vortex and wake regions, and separated flows are observed. Computed values for forces, moments, and pressure drop are in satisfactory agreement with water flow test data covering a maximum tube Reynolds number of 3. 5 x 10 (exp 6). The results will serve as a guide to improved design and enhanced testing of the disconnect...|$|R
40|$|Piping leakage {{can occur}} at T-joint, <b>elbows,</b> <b>valves,</b> or nozzles in {{nuclear power plants}} and nonnuclear power plants such as {{petrochemical}} plants when subjected to extreme loads and such leakage of piping systems {{can also lead to}} fire or explosion. For example, leakage of sodium, toxic gases, or nitrogen in hospitals can cause man-made hazards. The primary objective of this research is to understand the vibration effects due to classical/nonclassical damping with building-piping systems under extreme loads. The current evaluation employed finite-element analysis to calculate the effects of the responses of classically and nonclassically damped building-piping systems. Classical and nonclassical damping matrices for a coupled primary-secondary system were developed based on the Rayleigh equation. A total of 10 selected ground motions were applied to single degree of freedom (SDOF) primary-SDOF secondary (2 -DOF coupled) systems in which the ratios of the natural frequencies between the primary and secondary systems ranged between 0. 9 and 1. 1. It revealed that the vibration effect of nonclassical damping was significant where the natural frequencies of the two systems were nearly tuned. For piping-material nonlinearity, the effects of nonclassical damping on the result forces of piping systems were not significantly different from those of classical damping...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this joint {{research}} project was to develop and demonstrate advanced sensors and computational technology for continuous monitoring of the condition of components, structures, and systems in advanced and next-generation nuclear power plants (NPPs). This project included investigating and adapting several advanced sensor technologies from Korean and US national laboratory research communities, {{some of which were}} developed and applied in non-nuclear industries. The project team investigated and developed sophisticated signal processing, noise reduction, and pattern recognition techniques and algorithms. The researchers installed sensors and conducted condition monitoring tests on two test loops, a check valve (an active component) and a piping elbow (a passive component), to demonstrate the feasibility of using advanced sensors and computational technology to achieve the project goal. Acoustic emission (AE) devices, optical fiber sensors, accelerometers, and ultrasonic transducers (UTs) were used to detect mechanical vibratory response of check <b>valve</b> and piping <b>elbow</b> in normal and degraded configurations. Chemical sensors were also installed to monitor the water chemistry in the piping elbow test loop. Analysis results of processed sensor data indicate that it is feasible to differentiate between the normal and degraded (with selected degradation mechanisms) configurations of these two components from the acquired sensor signals, but it is questionable that these methods can reliably identify the level and type of degradation. Additional research and development efforts are needed to refine the differentiation techniques and to reduce the level of uncertainties...|$|R

Some hematological levels HGB (hemoglobin), HCT (hematocrit), PLT(trombsit),WBC(white blood cell), RBC (erythrocyte) of the subjects were determined thanks to the blood samples taken in adequate amount, being suitable with its way by means of Sportsman Education And Health Research Center (SESAM) ’s <b>elbow</b> <b>valve</b> (v. brachialis) before and after 4 weeks camp, at 10 am, being hungry. SPSS package programme was implemented in order to analyse the data statistically, and a dependent ‘t’ test was conducted. In the research, body weight averages of taekwondoers were found out similar after 4 weeks camp. It was found out meaningful increase in RBC(p≤ 0, 05), parameters statistically but there isn’t any difference in WBC, PLT, HGB and HCT levels. As a result, since there was significant difference in RBC in the blood cells of the male taekwondoers during the camping period, but {{there was no significant difference}} in WBC, PLT, HCT and HGB it was determined that the camping period caused no significant difference on trained sportsmen with regard to their blood parameters...|$|R
40|$|Slush hydrogen, {{a mixture}} of the solid and liquid phases of hydrogen, is a {{possible}} source of fuel for the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) Project. Advantages of slush hydrogen over liquid hydrogen include greater heat capacity and greater density. However, practical use of slush hydrogen as a fuel requires systems of lines, valves, etc. which are designed to deliver the fuel in slush form with minimal solid loss {{as a result of}} pipe heating or flow friction. Engineers involved with the NASP Project developed FLUSH to calculate the pressure drop and slush hydrogen solid fraction loss for steady-state, one-dimensional flow. FLUSH solves the steady-state, one-dimensional energy equation and the Bernoulli equation for pipe flow. The program performs these calculations for each two-node element [...] straight pipe length, <b>elbow,</b> <b>valve,</b> fitting, or other part of the piping system [...] specified by the user. The user provides flow rate, upstream pressure, initial solid hydrogen fraction, element heat leak, and element parameters such as length and diameter. For each element, FLUSH first calculates the pressure drop, then figures the slush solid fraction exiting the element. The code employs GASPLUS routines to calculate thermodynamic properties for the slush hydrogen. FLUSH is written in FORTRAN IV for DEC VAX series computers running VMS. An executable is provided on the tape. The GASPLUS physical properties routines which are required for building the executable are included as one object library on the program media (full source code for GASPLUS is available separately as COSMIC Program Number LEW- 15091). FLUSH is available in DEC VAX BACKUP format on a 9 -track 1600 BPI magnetic tape (standard media) or on a TK 50 tape cartridge. FLUSH was developed in 1989...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (DTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 2004 Despite efforts {{since the}} 1950 s, laminar flow through pipe {{fittings}} {{is still a}} topic that needs investigation (Jacobs, 1993). Most experimental studies on this topic include fittings such as contractions, expansions, <b>elbows,</b> <b>valves</b> and orifices (Edwards et aI., 1985; Turian et al., 1998; Pal & Hwang, 1999). Although sudden contractions are not often found in industry, most researchers included these fittings {{as part of their}} experimental investigation. The volume of work done on flow through sudden contractions over the last 50 years (e. g. Bogue, 1959; Christian et aI., 1972; Vrentas & Duda, 1973; Boger, 1987; Bullen et aI., 1996; Sisavath et aI., 2002), establishes its place of importance in the fundamental understanding offluid flow and fluid mechanics. There are inconsistent reports on the status ofthe study ofNewtonian fluids flowing through sudden contractions, i. e., that "it is a solved problem" (Boger, 1987) and "that it is far from being resolved" (Sisavath et aI., 2002). One reason for this apparent contradiction is the fact that most experimental studies do not agree with one another or with analytical and numerical studies. A state-of-the-art literature review by Pienaar et al. (2001) confirmed this and that further investigation of this topic is required. To explore these contradictions, it was necessary for one study to do both an experimental and numerical investigation and compare the results with existing literature. It was also important to find some basis for agreement of experimental work and not just add another data set to the existing scattered database. A test facility was built for testing three contraction ratios, i. e., ~ = 0. 22, 0. 50 and 0. 85. A range ofNewtonian and non-Newtonian fluids was tested over a wide range ofReynolds number (Re = 0. 01 - 100 000) ...|$|R
