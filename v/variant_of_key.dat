40|$|Abstract Indirect {{anticoagulants}} such as warfarin are the ‘gold standard’ {{for prevention}} and treatment of thromboembolic complications in patients at risk (in atrial fibrillation of valvular and nonvalvular etiology, the presence of artificial heart valves, orthopedic and trauma interventions, and other pathological conditions). A wide range of doses required to achieve a therapeutic effect indicates {{the need for a}} personalized approach to the appointment of warfarin. In addition to the dependence on the patient's clinical characteristics (sex, age, smoking status, diagnosis), there is a clear association between the warfarin dose and the carriage <b>of</b> certain allelic <b>variants</b> <b>of</b> <b>key</b> genes that makes it possible to apply molecular genetic testing for individual dose adjustment.

40|$|Vestimentiferan Tws colonize {{hydrothermal}} vents {{and cold}} seeps worldwide. They lack a digestive system and gain nutrition from endosymbiotic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. It is currently assumed that vestimentiferan Tws harbour {{only a single}} endosymbiont type. A few studies found indications for additional symbionts, but conclusive evidence for a multiple symbiosis is still missing. We investigated Tws from Marsili Seamount, a hydrothermal vent in the Mediterranean Sea. Molecular and morphological analyses identified the Tws as Lamellibrachia anaximandri. 16 S ribosomal RNA clone libraries revealed two distinct gammaproteobacterial phylotypes that were closely related to sequences from other Lamellibrachia symbionts. Catalysed reporter deposition {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} with specific probes showed that these sequences are from two distinct symbionts. We also found two <b>variants</b> <b>of</b> <b>key</b> genes for sulfur oxidation and carbon fixation, suggesting that both symbiont types are autotrophic sulfur oxidizers. Our results therefore show that vestimentiferans can host multiple co-occurring symbiont types. Statistical analyses of vestimentiferan symbiont diversity revealed that host genus, habitat type, water depth and geographic region together accounted for 27 % of genetic diversity, but only water depth had a significant effect on its own. Phylogenetic analyses showed a clear grouping of sequences according to depth, thus confirming the important role water depth played in shaping vestimentiferan symbiont diversity...|$|R

Most agricultural sectors show two strong linkages in the flow account. The findings suggest that Bangladeshi export sector, is typically undiversified in that it relies heavily on agriculture and related industries, with jute and jute textiles accounting for over 70 percent of net export earnings.

40|$|Abstract Background Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary, {{the causal}} agent of potato late blight, is {{responsible}} for tremendous crop losses worldwide. Countries {{in the northern part}} of the Andes dedicate a large proportion of the highlands to the production of potato, and more recently, solanaceous fruits such as cape gooseberry (Physalis peruviana) and tree tomato (Solanum betaceum), all of which are hosts of this oomycete. In the Andean region, P. infestans populations have been well characterized in Ecuador and Peru, but are poorly understood in Colombia and Venezuela. To understand the P. infestans population structure in the Northern part of the Andes, four nuclear regions (ITS, Ras, β-tubulin and Avr 3 a) and one mitochondrial (Cox 1) region were analyzed in isolates of P. infestans sampled from different hosts in Colombia and Venezuela. Results Low genetic diversity was found within this sample of P. infestans isolates from crops within several regions of Colombia and Venezuela, revealing the presence of clonal populations of the pathogen in this region. We detected low frequency heterozygotes, and their distribution patterns might be a consequence of a high migration rate among populations with poor effective gene flow. Consistent genetic differentiation exists among isolates from different regions. Conclusions The results here suggest that in the Northern Andean region P. infestans is a clonal population with some within-clone variation. P. infestans populations in Venezuela reflect historic isolation that is being reinforced by a recent self-sufficiency of potato seeds. In summary, the P. infestans population is mainly shaped by migration and probably by the appearance <b>of</b> <b>variants</b> <b>of</b> <b>key</b> effectors such as Avr 3 a. </p...|$|R

Genotype AA of the FTO SNP rs 8050136 associated with higher BMI and greater waist circumference compared to the genotype CC. In general linear model, no significant interaction for FTO genotype-relative VO(2) max (mL·kg(- 1) ·min(- 1)) or FTO genotype-absolute VO(2) max (L·min(- 1)) on BMI or waist circumference was found. Main effects of aerobic performance on body composition traits were significant (p< 0. 001). Logistic regression modelling found no significant interaction between aerobic fitness and FTO genotype. LEP SNP rs 7799039, LEPR SNPs rs 8179183 and rs 1137101 did not associate with any of the measured variables, and no significant interactions of LEP or LEPR genotype with aerobic fitness were observed. In addition, none of the studied SNPs associated with aerobic or neuromuscular performance. Aerobic fitness may not modify the effect of FTO variation on body composition traits.
