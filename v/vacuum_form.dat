50|$|Wood {{patterns}} {{are a common}} material to <b>vacuum</b> <b>form</b> but probably the most obvious. Wood is relatively inexpensive and allows the customer to make changes to the design easily. Using recycled objects or forms are the most sustainable {{way to make a}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>form</b> because they are 'found objects' at no additional cost. The number of samples that one is able to get from any pattern depends {{on the size of the}} part and the thickness of the material. Once the specifications of the part have been met, the pattern is then used to create a ceramic composite mold, or cast aluminum mold for regular production. Potentially, there are ways to create holes in plaster with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>form</b> if the replicated forms you make the <b>vacuum</b> <b>form</b> from are deep enough and you leave gaps between them for the plastic to form into. Then, once the plastic is used to cast a plaster mold, the deep plastic areas will leave holes if the mold is not completely filled.|$|E

50|$|There are {{numerous}} patterns {{one can make}} with <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming.</b> The most inventive way to use <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> is to take any small item, replicate it many times and then vacuum for the new pattern {{to create a more}} cohesive <b>form.</b> The <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> helps tie the individual pieces together and make one mold out of many pieces that can easily be replicated.

50|$|Suitable {{materials}} {{for use in}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> are conventionally thermoplastics. The most common and easiest to use thermoplastic is high impact polystyrene sheeting (HIPS). This is molded around a wood, structural foam or cast or machined aluminium mold, and can form to almost any shape. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> is also appropriate for transparent materials such as acrylic, which are widely used in applications for aerospace such as passenger cabin window canopies for military fixed wing aircraft and compartments for rotary wing aircraft. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>forming</b> is often used in low-level technology classes for {{an easy way to}} mold.|$|R

50|$|Thread breakup occurs {{where two}} fluids or a fluid in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>form</b> a free surface with surface energy. If more surface area is present {{than the minimum}} {{required}} to contain the volume of fluid, the system has an excess of surface energy. A system not at the minimum energy state will attempt to rearrange so as {{to move toward the}} lower energy state, leading to the breakup of the fluid into smaller masses to minimize the system surface energy by reducing the surface area. The exact outcome of the thread breakup process is dependent on the surface tension, viscosity, density, and diameter of the thread undergoing breakup.|$|E

5000|$|Based on {{conceptual}} {{drawings by}} Ralph McQuarrie, Liz Moore and Nick Pemberton sculpted {{designs for the}} helmet, Brian Muir sculpted armor pieces for the stormtrooper costume. Muir, who was also responsible for sculpting the Darth Vader costume, worked out of the Art Department at Elstree Studios. The suit was molded and initially cast in plaster, with Muir sharpening the detail at the plaster stage. The plaster casts were then remolded and cast in fiberglass to use as the [...] "tools" [...] for the vacuum forming process. The suits were produced in house by Tashy Baines, the resident vacuum former, but then a problem developed with the machine. As Shepperton Design Studios had already been used to <b>vacuum</b> <b>form</b> the helmets, the fiberglass molds for the armor were then sent to them for vacuum forming the suits. By the end of production, two different helmets were produced; one for the common stunt trooper and a second design for close-ups. Fifty stunt helmets were produced in white-painted HDPE and six hero helmets were produced in white ABS plastic. Besides the material used, the two designs can be differentiated by differences in the eyes, the ears, and the mouth area.|$|E

Roller cutting can't be used for making holes or features in the sides of vacuum formings, as the cutter tool always cuts vertically from the bottom.|$|R

We find that there exists an interesting regime in the parameter space of the wave configurations: a near-linear regime in which the amplitude of the wave is low enough that one expects the geometric deviation from flat spacetime to be negligible, but nevertheless where nonlinearities can excite unstable modes of the Einstein evolution equations causing the metric functions to evolve out of control.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of an environment of mobile charges, the bound-state Schrödinger Hamiltonian for an embedded He atom differs from its <b>vacuum</b> <b>form.</b> The central problem of incorporating screening in the nucleusbound- electron and bound-electronbound-electron terms of this Hamiltonian is investigated here for the He ground state in a comparative manner by using two models, and the same product form of 1 s-type parametric hydrogenic functions to perform exploratory variational calculations. Both models employ induced charge densities in the corresponding Poisson equations with a fixed point-like nucleus, but the underlying charge-density response of the host system is generated by differently chosen perturbations. These are the point-charge nucleus and the nucleusbound-electron charge distribution as external perturbations. The repulsive bound-electronbound-electron interaction in the Hamiltonian is modelled by a parametric Yukawa-type potential.
