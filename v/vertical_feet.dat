5|$|The {{exhibition}} remained open to {{the public}} until 2005, when it was closed for a third restoration. The $12-million restoration, by Olin Conservation, Inc., of Great Falls, Virginia, started with the 26 sections of the painting and recreated its original shape of 14 panels hung from a circular railing, slightly flared out at the bottom. In the process, some original pieces were found of the 12 circumferential feet that had been cut away. Fourteen <b>vertical</b> <b>feet</b> of sky was also restored.|$|E
5|$|Mount Washington is {{a common}} objective, and is often climbed from Pinkham Notch. There are {{numerous}} trail approaches from the Appalachian Mountain Club's visitor's center. Although trail distances seem short, {{the trip to the}} summit should not be underestimated; most trail approaches involve at least 4,000 <b>vertical</b> <b>feet</b> (1,200m) of climbing, including an ascent of the rocky summit cone and the boulder-strewn upper slopes. Weather changes very quickly, and one must be prepared for extreme conditions. The Tuckerman Ravine Trail is the most popular trail in the notch, ascending to the summit via the headwall of Tuckerman Ravine. The Huntington Ravine Trail is widely considered the most difficult trail in New Hampshire, making its way up the precipitous headwall of neighboring Huntington Ravine, where there are several rock climbing opportunities.|$|E
5|$|The South Tower has one freight {{and three}} {{passenger}} elevators. The elevators are the second fastest {{in the city}} of San Francisco, second only to those in 555 California Street and tied with those in 555 Mission Street. The elevators of the South Tower can travel from the ground floor to the 61st floor (the mechanical level) in only 26 seconds to speed passenger traffic flow. This means the elevators can travel about 1,200 <b>vertical</b> <b>feet</b> (366 m) in a minute. The elevators have artificial intelligence control systems that figure out passenger traffic patterns and dispatch the three elevators to handle passenger needs accordingly. The bottom of each elevator shaft has a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil to stop a falling elevator without injuring the passengers inside.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} pilot-study data of test subject forces {{induced by}} intravehicular {{activities such as}} push-offs and landings {{with both hands and}} feet. Five subjects participated in this investigation. Three orthogonal force axes were measured in the NASA KC- 135 research aircraft's 'zero-g' environment. The largest forces were induced during <b>vertical</b> <b>foot</b> push-offs, including one of 534 newtons (120 lbs). The mean <b>vertical</b> <b>foot</b> push-off was 311 newtons (70 lbs). The vertical hand push-off forces were also relatively large, including one of 267 newtons (60 lbs) with a mean of 151 newtons (34 lbs). These force magnitudes of these forces would result in a Shuttle gravity environment of about 1 x exp 10 - 4 g's...|$|R

25|$|The coastal ice {{cliffs of}} Brown Glacier and Stephenson Glacier, which in 1954 were over 50 feet high, had {{disappeared}} by 1963 when the glaciers terminated {{as much as}} 100 yards inland. Baudissin Glacier on the north coast, and Vahsel Glacier {{on the west coast}} have lost at least 100 and 200 <b>vertical</b> <b>feet</b> of ice, respectively. Winston Glacier, which retreated approximately one mile between 1947 and 1963, appears to be a very sensitive indicator of glacier change on the island. The young moraines flanking Winston Lagoon show that Winston Glacier has lost at least 300 <b>vertical</b> <b>feet</b> of ice within a recent time period.|$|E
25|$|Trails {{leading from}} the first two trailheads involve {{relatively}} direct climbs of about 2,000 <b>vertical</b> <b>feet</b> (610 m) to the summit, whereas trails from the Los Alamos Road trailhead take a longer route to the summit but involve about the same vertical rise.|$|E
5000|$|Searchmont Resort is a {{ski resort}} {{located in the}} {{community}} of Searchmont, Ontario, Canada, and mainly caters to residents of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario and Algoma, which is 45 minutes away. The area has a 750 <b>vertical</b> <b>foot</b> drop, featuring 18 runs and four chair lifts (one quad, one triple, one double, and one beginner poma lift). The quad lift has been non-operational since 2011 due to maintenance issues.|$|R
50|$|The Hanoi Vertical Run is a <b>vertical</b> <b>foot</b> race {{held at the}} Landmark 72 in Hanoi, Vietnam. The run {{starts at}} the ground floor lobby and {{finishes}} at the 72nd floor observation deck. Standard running shoes should be adequate for this event. Its participants are referred to both as runners and as climbers, and are often stair- and tower-running enthusiasts. The race covers a vertical distance of 350 metres and takes in 1,914 steps.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1950 Sugarloaf Mountain Ski Club was formed and club member Amos Winter and many volunteers helped cut the first trail up Sugarloaf Mountain, {{appropriately}} named Winter's Way. It wound down the Mountain with a 1,800 <b>vertical</b> <b>foot</b> drop and was cut in many places across the hill. Amos noted later that this trail was flawed in its design. In 1952, {{the first of many}} ski races was held on Winter's Way.|$|R
25|$|The {{steps of}} Pittsburgh {{comprise}} some 712 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 <b>vertical</b> <b>feet.</b> They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, {{and many other}} steep streets with stairs for sidewalks. Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.|$|E
25|$|There are {{no major}} ski resorts on North Mountain. Much {{of the land}} on the {{mountain}} {{is part of the}} Pennsylvania State Game Lands, particularly State Game Lands Number 13. However, between 1964 and 1984, a ski slope did exist on North Mountain near Sonestown. The slope featured a J-bar lift. A Poma lift was also brought to the slope, but never installed. There were plans at one point to extend the ski slope to a height 1400 <b>vertical</b> <b>feet,</b> but these plans ran afoul of local zoning laws. As of 2008, the slope was well-maintained.|$|E
25|$|Pointe {{technique}} {{is the part}} of classical ballet technique that concerns pointe work, in which a ballet dancer supports all body weight on the tips of fully extended feet within pointe shoes. A dancer is said to be en pointe when the dancer's body is supported in this manner, and a fully extended vertical foot is said to be en pointe when touching the floor, even when not bearing weight. Pointe work is performed while wearing pointe shoes, which employ structural reinforcing to distribute the dancer's weight load throughout the foot, thus reducing the load on the toes enough to enable the dancer to support all body weight on fully <b>vertical</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Mile High Triple Jump - Only one {{contestant}} participates {{for each}} team. He {{or she must}} clear a high jump bar and two [...] "hurdles" [...] by jumping off the ground with help of elastic cord. Finally, {{he or she must}} then take a sticky marker, jump off a platform, and attempt to paste it on a vertical wall. Each bar, hurdle, and <b>vertical</b> <b>foot</b> on the leap cleared is worth 10 points.|$|R
50|$|The Diamond Creek {{mine was}} opened some years after gold was first {{discovered}} and dug 700 <b>feet</b> <b>vertical</b> and 300 <b>feet</b> underlay. The value of gold {{taken from the}} mine {{is reported to be}} between ₤1,000,000 and ₤2,000,000 Australian at the time.|$|R

25|$|Yuichiro Miura {{became the}} first man to ski down Everest in the 1970s. He descended nearly 4,200 <b>vertical</b> <b>feet</b> from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries. Stefan Gatt and Marco Siffredi snowboarded Mount Everest in 2001. Other Everest skiers include Davo Karničar of Slovenia, who {{completed}} a top to south base camp descent in 2000, Hans Kammerlander of Italy in 1996 on the north side, and Kit DesLauriers of the United States in 2006. In 2006 Tomas Olsson planned to ski down the north face, but his anchor broke while he was rappelling down a cliff in the Norton couloir at about 8,500 metres, resulting in his death from a two and a half kilometre fall. Also, Marco Siffredi died in 2002 on his second snow-boarding expedition.|$|E
500|$|The Wii Family Edition variant is {{identical}} to the original model, but is designed to sit horizontally (the <b>vertical</b> <b>feet</b> are still present; however, the front labels are rotated and a stand is no longer included) and removes the GameCube controller and memory card ports, although the casing under the top cover still has the GameCube controller and memory card ports holes with no ports and no slots. [...] For this reason, the Family Edition variant is incompatible with GameCube games and accessories. The console was announced on August 17, 2011 and released in Europe and North America in October 2011.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1924 British Mount Everest expedition, Mallory and his {{climbing}} partner, Andrew [...] "Sandy" [...] Irvine, disappeared on the North-East ridge {{during their}} attempt {{to make the first}} ascent of the world's highest mountain. The pair were last seen when they were about 800 <b>vertical</b> <b>feet</b> (245m) from the summit.|$|E
2500|$|The Bogus Basin {{ski area}} opened in 1942 and hosts {{multiple}} winter activities, primarily alpine skiing and snowboarding, but also cross-country skiing and snow tubing. [...] "Bogus" [...] is [...] {{from the city}} limits (less than an hour drive from downtown) on a twisty paved road which climbs 3400 <b>vertical</b> <b>feet</b> (1036m) through sagebrush and forest.|$|E
2500|$|After a hard {{winter of}} 1856–57, and a wet spring, {{construction}} resumed in July 1857. Sandstone {{was used for}} the first twenty five <b>vertical</b> <b>feet</b> of each tower base. Limestone encased this sandstone, acting as an armor covering against the constant flow of water and the accidental collision with watercraft. The remaining height of each tower was to be constructed of sandstone, rough cut and with a large draft. Roebling said this gave the towers [...] "a massive look, quite suitable to their function." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many {{movies and}} TV {{specials}} have been filmed in the Sunshine area. [...] Sunshine Village was utilized as a task destination {{for the season}} ending episode of the popular American reality television show The Amazing Race 5 (original broadcast date September, 2004). In the final 13th leg of this race, the three remaining teams took taxicabs from the Calgary International Airport to Banff’s Sunshine Village. After riding the gondola {{to the base of}} Lookout Mountain, the contestants donned snowshoes before making the approximate 2,000 <b>vertical</b> <b>foot</b> hike to the top ridge of the Great Divide (elevation 8,900 feet). Sunshine regularly host the Marjoe Gortner Celebrity Sports Invitational charity ski events to raise money for charities such as the Dream Foundation and Robert F.

2500|$|The film's climax on Veridian III {{was filmed}} over eight days on an {{elevated}} plateau in the [...] "Valley of Fire", north of Las Vegas, Nevada. The rise's height and sloped sides required {{cast and crew}} to climb 160 <b>vertical</b> <b>feet</b> using safety ropes and carry all provisions and equipment with them. The 110-degree heat was difficult for all involved, especially Shatner, as his character wore an all-wool uniform. Safety harnesses and wires were used to keep performers safe from tumbling off a precipice, and were then removed digitally.|$|E
2500|$|The Beach Bill {{declares}} that all [...] "wet sand" [...] within [...] <b>vertical</b> <b>feet</b> {{of the low}} tide line belongs {{to the state of}} Oregon. In addition, it recognizes public easements of all beach areas up to the line of vegetation, regardless of underlying property rights. The public has [...] "free and uninterrupted use of the beaches," [...] and property owners are required to seek state permits for building and other uses of the ocean shore. While some parts of the beach remain privately owned, state and federal courts have upheld Oregon’s right to regulate development of those lands and preserve public access.|$|E
2500|$|The Phoenicia Trail, {{part of the}} Long Path, {{the former}} bark road {{extended}} to the fire tower, is a widely used route to Tremper's summit. Blazed with red plastic DEC markers, it begins [...] south of Phoenicia along Old Route 28 (now Ulster County Route 40), across from the Esopus. It joins the old road after a half-mile (1km) and follows it through several switchbacks past the old quarry, a spring, the Baldwin Memorial Lean-To and another spring. It reaches the lean-to and fire tower at , after climbing nearly 2,000 <b>vertical</b> <b>feet</b> (610 m) from the trailhead.|$|E

2500|$|A dancer may {{transition}} to en pointe {{by any of}} three possible methods: relevé, sauté or piqué. In the relevé method, the dancer rises smoothly by rotating the foot downward until it reaches a fully extended, vertical orientation, while the toe box remains {{in contact with the}} floor, thus [...] "rolling up" [...] on the foot. This may be done either gradually or rapidly, on one foot or both feet, beginning with {{feet flat on the floor}} or in demi-pointe (heels raised). In the sauté method, the dancer springs up and lands en pointe. In the process, the feet break contact with the floor and the dancer is briefly airborne. To {{transition to}} en pointe via piqué, a dancer will step out directly onto a fully extended, <b>vertical</b> <b>foot.</b> The other foot is then raised from the floor, thereby leaving the dancer en pointe.|$|R
50|$|To {{access the}} summit {{you can take}} the Pinnacle Rock trail. The trailhead is {{on the west side of}} the {{mountain}} and is a nine hundred <b>foot</b> <b>vertical</b> gain.|$|R
