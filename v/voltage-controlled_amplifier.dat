25|$|<b>Voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifier</b> (VCA) – After {{the signal}} {{generated}} by one (or {{a mix of}} more) VCOs has been modified by filters and LFOs, and its waveform has been shaped (contoured) by an ADSR envelope generator, it then passes on {{to one or more}} voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs). A VCA is a preamp that boosts (amplifies) the electronic signal before passing it on to an external or built-in power amplifier, as well as a means to control its amplitude (volume) using an attenuator. The gain of the VCA is affected by a control voltage (CV), coming from an envelope generator, an LFO, the keyboard or some other source.|$|E

[...] The machine is noted for its powerful bass drum sound, built from a combination of a bridged T-network sine oscillator, a low-pass filter, and a <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifier.</b> The bass drum decay control allows the user to lengthen the sound, creating uniquely low frequencies that flatten slightly over long periods, possibly not by design.

50|$|Analog signal {{processing}} is for signals {{that have not}} been digitized, as in legacy radio, telephone, radar, and television systems. This involves linear electronic circuits as well as non-linear ones. The former are, for instance, passive filters, active filters, additive mixers, integrators and delay lines. Non-linear circuits include compandors, multiplicators (frequency mixers and <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifiers),</b> <b>voltage-controlled</b> filters, voltage-controlled oscillators and phase-locked loops.|$|R

50|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Watts {{began working}} at Trident on the mixer {{assembly}} line in their factory on the Shepperton Film Studios lot. In 1976, he showed company co-founder Malcolm Toft an idea he had for a computer-based mixer automation system, using a Sinclair Spectrum computer, which could change equalization settings automatically without using <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifiers</b> (VCA). Toft liked the idea and it {{became the basis for}} the automation of the Trident Di-An (digitally controlled analog) mixer. Watts worked on most of Trident's product line in various engineering roles, including as chief engineer on the VECTOR series large-format analog mixing console and the Di-An mixer.|$|R
50|$|Using this approach, Moog built a {{range of}} signal-generating, signal-modifying and {{controller}} modules, each {{of which could be}} easily inter-connected to control or modify the functions and outputs of any other. The central component was the voltage-controlled oscillator, which generated the primary sound signal, capable of producing a variety of waveforms including sawtooth, square and sine waves. The output from the VCO could then be modified and shaped by feeding the signal into other modules such as <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> <b>voltage-controlled</b> filters, envelope generators, and ring modulators. Another customization as part of the Moog Modular Synthesizer is the sequencer, which provided a source of timed step control voltages that were programmed to create repetitive note patterns, without using the keyboard. The inputs and outputs of any module could be cross-linked with patch cords (using tip-sleeve ("mono") ¼-inch plugs) and, together with the module control knobs and switches, could create a nearly infinite variety of sounds and effects.|$|R
50|$|Like the {{original}} Minimoog, the Voyager has six sound sources. Five of these (three voltage-controlled oscillators with switchable waveforms, a noise generator, and an external line input) pass to a mixer with independent level controls. The mixed {{output of the}} sources is then passed through the voltage-controlled filter and a <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifier,</b> {{each of which has}} its own ADSR (Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release) envelope generator. The voltage-controlled filter can itself be made to oscillate, thus comprising the Voyager's sixth sound source.|$|E

Pick up simulators used on guitars with single-coil pick ups replicate the sound of guitars with humbucker pick ups, or vice versa. A de-fretter is a bass guitar effect that simulates {{the sound of a}} fretless bass. The effect uses an envelope-controlled filter and <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifier</b> to [...] "soften" [...] a note's attack both in volume and timbre.|$|E
50|$|The Taurus is monophonic, {{with its}} single voice {{generated}} by two oscillators running through one three-stage <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifier.</b> For the Taurus I and Taurus III, only one waveform was available: a distorted sawtooth wave. The Taurus II introduced a second waveform, the pulse wave. All {{models of the}} Taurus use a 24db/octave resonant low pass filter with key tracking. Although the early models did not include an LFO, the Taurus III has an LFO that can be routed to either oscillator pitch or filter frequency.|$|E
50|$|If one {{input of}} an analog {{multiplier}} is {{held at a}} steady state voltage, a signal at the second input will be scaled {{in proportion to the}} level on the fixed input. In this case the analog multiplier may be considered to be a voltage controlled amplifier. Obvious applications would be for electronic volume control and automatic gain control (AGC). Although analog multipliers are often used for such applications, <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are not necessarily true analog multipliers. For example, an integrated circuit designed {{to be used as a}} volume control may have a signal input designed for 1 Vp-p, and a control input designed for 0-5 V dc; that is, the two inputs are not symmetrical and the control input will have a limited bandwidth.|$|R
50|$|To prevent {{digital signal}} {{overflow}} and its audible result, the digital output volume {{must be kept}} low enough so that bit 14 will never be used. On the first generation MT-32, this can simply be done by selecting a lower main volume on the unit's front panel, which directly controls the software main volume setting, which in turn directly translates into the amplitude of the digital output signal. On later generation units, this does not work, as the main volume knob and the software main volume setting only modify {{the volume of the}} analogue output using <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and have little effect on the amplitude of the digital signal. To prevent signal overflow, each individual part's volume (controller #7) must be kept low instead.|$|R
5000|$|Early analog synthesizers used {{technology}} from electronic analog computers and laboratory test equipment. They were generally [...] "modular" [...] synthesizers, {{consisting of a}} number of independent electronic modules connected by patch cables into a patchbay that resembled the jackfields used by 1940s-era telephone operators. Synthesizer modules in early analog synthesizers included voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), voltage-controlled filters (VCFs), and <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifiers</b> (VCAs). The control voltage varied frequency in VCOs and VCFs, and attenuation (gain) in VCAs. Additionally, they used envelope generators, low-frequency oscillators, and ring modulators.Some synthesizers also had effects devices, such as reverb units, or tools such as sequencers or sound mixers. Because many of these modules took input sound signals and processed them, an analog synthesizer could be used both as a sound-generating and sound-processing system.|$|R

The color scheme follows the Mark III, although Mark I and II styles were available in limited editions. On Nov 1, 2016 Korg announced the Arp Odyssei for iOS.|$|E
5000|$|The {{filtered}} signal is then routed to the <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifier</b> (VCA), where its contour {{is shaped by}} a dedicated ADS (attack, decay/release, sustain) envelope generator. Part {{of the appeal of}} this instrument over the early modular Moogs was that the Minimoog required no patch cables; its signal and control voltage path is hard-wired, or [...] "normalled". While this imposed the signal flow limitation outlined above (VCO → VCF → VCA), there are ways to tweak the sound. For example, in reality, the Minimoog has six sound sources. Five of these sound sources pass to a mixer with independent level controls: ...|$|E

40|$|A {{new digital}} beam {{position}} monitor (DBPM) {{system has been}} developed and successfully tested at the PSI proton accelerators. The DBPM hardware consists of an analogue RF front-end (RFFE), a VMEbus backplane module (VBM), and the PSI VME PMC Carrier board (VPC). The RFFE combines the 2 nd RF harmonic (101. 26 MHz) beam signals of pickup coils with a 101. 31 MHz pilot signal. The RFFE output signals are undersampled and down-converted to base-band (no analogue mixer) by ADCs and DDCs (Direct Digital Downconverters) on the VBM. The DDCs send the digitised beam and pilot signal amplitudes to a Virtex 2 Pro FPGA on the VPC board. The FPGA calculates the beam positions at different averaging rates, checks interlock limits, and provides triggered storage of beam position waveforms. Furthermore, the FPGA performs automatic gain control of <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifiers</b> (VCAs) of RFFE and VBM. By continuous normalisation of beam to pilot signal, nonlinearities and temperature drifts of the electronics are eliminated. Compared to the old analogue BPM electronics, the new DBPMs offer an increased dynamic range (0. 2 µA to 2 mA instead of 5 µA to 2 mA) and larger bandwidth (10 kHz instead of 10 Hz) ...|$|R
40|$|To provide {{not only}} an {{interesting}} challenge but also experience in teamwork and communication skills, honors students in my introductory circuit analysis course are assigned a project involving electronic music synthesis devices. The students are teamed up into pairs, with each pair having responsibility for one of several modules which together compose a working voltage-controlled sound synthesis system. In addition to their individual tasks, each pair of students must collaborate throughout the semester with the others to resolve system integration issues. A typical set of modules built by the students includes <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> power supplies, envelope (or transient) generators, and simple low frequency oscillators. Basic circuit designs are provided which the students must analyze, construct, integrate into a functional synthesizer, and explain to the class during their final oral report and demonstration.

50|$|Some higher-end {{consoles}} use <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifier</b> (VCA) groups VCAs and DCAs function {{somewhat like}} subgroups but let the operator control {{the level of}} multiple input channels with a single fader. Unlike subgroups, no sub-mix is created. The audio signals from the assigned channels remain routed independently of VCA assignments. Since no sub-mix is created, {{it is not possible}} to insert processing such as compressors into a VCA/DCA group. In addition, on most VCA/DCA-equipped consoles, post-fader auxiliary send levels are affected by the VCA master. This is usually desirable, as post-fader auxiliary sends are commonly used for effects such as reverb, and sends to these effects should track changes in the channel signal level.|$|E
50|$|Usson {{is known}} for his DIY work with synthesizers, {{especially}} modular synthesizers. This is reflected in some design elements of the MiniBrute. For example, the MiniBrute includes an effect called Brute Factor, which is a form of overdrive. It is inspired by the technique of rerouting the <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifier</b> (VCA) output on a Moog Minimoog to be processed through the synthesizer again. However, Brute Factor does not require any patching, as it is built into the MiniBrute. Additionally, Usson has made technical diagrams for the MiniBrute's circuitry available on his website, HackABrute, to encourage users to modify their machines. He has also included proposed modifications that have been tested. However, making modifications to the internal system, including those listed on the site, voids Arturia's product warranty.|$|E

Dugan thought that a microphone should not be turned on unless it was getting some worthwhile signal, {{more than just the}} room ambiance. His frustration with microphone mixing led him to experiment for a few years with microphone signals controlled automatically by <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifiers</b> (VCAs), finally developing the [...] "Dugan Music System", shown to the AES at their 49th convention, held in New York in 1974. This system used a novel proportional gain algorithm whereby the total gain was divided between all active microphones. The microphones were [...] "continuously and automatically adjusted" [...] by a set of VCAs to bring each microphone up or down in the mix, based on how much signal it was sending relative to the signal received by a reference microphone placed somewhat distant from the other microphones. Dugan's patent application for a [...] "Control Apparatus for Sound Reinforcement Systems" [...] was accepted and published on June 4, 1974. This was the first useful automatic microphone mixing algorithm, the basis for all of Dugan's later systems.|$|R

50|$|In 1969, Salvatore Martirano, {{along with}} a group of {{engineers}} and musicians at the University of Illinois, began work on the design and construction of a musical electronic instrument. The instrument, named the SAL-MAR Construction, is a hybrid system in which TTL logical circuits (small and medium scale integration) drive analog modules, such as <b>voltage-controlled</b> oscillators, <b>amplifiers</b> and filters. The performer sits at a horizontal control panel of 291 lightable touch-sensitive switches (no moving parts). The two-state switches are used by a performer to dial sequences of numbers that are characterized by a variety of intervals and lengths. A sequence may bypass, address, or be added to other sequences forming an interlocked tree of control and data according to a performer's choice. The unique characteristic of the switch is that it can be driven both manually and logically, which allows human/machine interaction. The most innovative feature of the human/machine interface is that it allows the user to switch from control of macro to micro parameters of the information output. This is analogous to a zoom lens on a camera.|$|R

The machine includes volume knobs for each voice, multiple audio outputs, and a DIN sync port (a precursor to MIDI) to synchronize with other devices via the Digital Control Bus (DCB) interface, considered groundbreaking at the time.
