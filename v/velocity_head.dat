50|$|<b>Velocity</b> <b>head</b> {{is due to}} {{the bulk}} motion of a fluid (kinetic energy). Its {{pressure}} head correspondent is the dynamic pressure.|$|E
50|$|The {{pressure}} of a fluid is different when it flows {{than when it}} is not flowing. This is why static pressure and dynamic pressure are never the same in a system in which the fluid is in motion. This pressure difference arises from a change in fluid velocity that produces <b>velocity</b> <b>head,</b> which is a term of the Bernoulli equation that is zero when there is no bulk motion of the fluid. In the picture on the right, the pressure differential is entirely due to the change in <b>velocity</b> <b>head</b> of the fluid, but it can be measured as a pressure head because of the Bernoulli principle. If, on the other hand, we could measure the velocity of the fluid, the pressure head could be calculated from the <b>velocity</b> <b>head.</b> See the Derivations of Bernoulli equation.|$|E

In the interest of minimizing bending loads and ensuring safe separation of the first-stage solid rocket motor, the vehicle is con- strained to follow a gravity-turn trajectory. This reduces the design space to just two free parameters, the pitch rate after a short vertical rise phase to clear the launch pad, and initial launch azimuth. The pitch rate primarily controls the in-plane parameters (altitude, speed, flight path angle) of the trajectory whereas the launch azimuth primarily controls the out-of-plane portion (<b>velocity</b> <b>heading.)</b> Thus, the optimization can be mechanized as two one-dimensional searches that converge quickly and reliably.

40|$|Growth <b>velocity</b> of <b>head</b> {{circumference}} was studied longitudinally {{in different}} gestational age groups of 222 appropriate-weight-for-dates (AFD) and 94 small-for-dates (SFD) healthy infants {{during the first}} 5 months of life. Term AFD and SFD infants showed a steady slowing of growth rate of head circumference from birth. In contrast, preterm AFD infants of less than 36 weeks' gestation showed an increasing velocity of growth followed by slowing, with maximum velocity occurring between 30 and 40 days after birth. The shorter the postconceptional age at birth the later maximum velocity occurred. However, those preterm AFD infants of between 30 and 33 weeks' gestation who were given a high caloric feed showed a similar velocity curve to that of infants of 34 - 37 weeks of gestation. Cross-sectional data were used to estimate growth <b>velocity</b> of <b>head</b> circumference in the fetus. Two conclusions emerged. First, there is a slowing of <b>head</b> growth <b>velocity</b> from 31 weeks' gestation in utero, and second, term infants show a marked increase in volocity after birth.

50|$|Halteres {{and vision}} both {{play a role}} in {{stabilizing}} the head. Flies are also able to perform compensatory head movements to stabilize their vision without the use of their halteres. When the visual field is artificially rotated around a fly at slower angular <b>velocities,</b> <b>head</b> stabilization still occurs. Head stabilization outputs due to optical inputs alone are slower to respond, but also last longer than those due to haltere inputs. From this result it can be concluded that although halteres are required for detecting fast rotations, the visual system is adept by itself at sensing and correcting for slower body movements. Thus, the visual and mechanosensory (halteres) systems work together to stabilize the visual field of the animal: first, by quickly responding to fast changes (halteres), and second, by maintaining that response until it is corrected (vision).|$|R

40|$|Single-unit {{recordings}} {{were obtained}} from 107 horizontal semicircular canal-related central vestibular neurons in three alert squirrel monkeys during passive sinusoidal whole-body rotation (WBR) while the head was free {{to move in the}} yaw plane (2. 3 Hz, 20 degrees /s). Most of the units were identified as secondary vestibular neurons by electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral vestibular nerve (61 / 80 tested). Both non-eye-movement (n = 52) and eye-movement-related (n = 55) units were studied. Unit responses recorded when the head was free to move were compared with responses recorded when the head was restrained from moving. WBR {{in the absence of a}} visual target evoked a compensatory vestibulocollic reflex (VCR) that effectively reduced the <b>head</b> <b>velocity</b> in space by an average of 33 +/- 14 %. In 73 units, the compensatory head movements were sufficiently large to permit the effect of the VCR on vestibular signal processing to be assessed quantitatively. The VCR affected the rotational responses of different vestibular neurons in different ways. Approximately one-half of the units (34 / 73, 47 %) had responses that decreased as <b>head</b> <b>velocity</b> decreased. However, the responses of many other units (24 / 73) showed little change. These cells had signals that were better correlated with trunk <b>velocity</b> than with <b>head</b> <b>velocity.</b> The remaining units had responses that were significantly larger (15 / 73, 21 %) when the VCR produced a decrease in <b>head</b> <b>velocity.</b> Eye-movement-related units tended to have rotational responses that were correlated with <b>head</b> <b>velocity.</b> On the other hand, non-eye-movement units tended to have rotational responses that were better correlated with trunk velocity. We conclude that sensory vestibular signals are transformed from head-in-space coordinates to trunk-in-space coordinates on many secondary vestibular neurons in the vestibular nuclei by the addition of inputs related to head rotation on the trunk. This coordinate transformation is presumably important for controlling postural reflexes and constructing a central percept of body orientation and movement in space...|$|R
