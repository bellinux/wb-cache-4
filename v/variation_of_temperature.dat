5|$|The {{biology of}} life {{operates}} {{within a certain}} range of temperatures. Heat {{is a form of}} energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature</b> greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature by expending metabolic energy.|$|E
5|$|Vega is {{only about}} {{a tenth of the}} age of the Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as massive its {{expected}} lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun; both stars are at present approaching the midpoint of their life expectancies. Vega has an unusually low abundance of the elements with a higher atomic number than that of helium. Vega is also a variable star that varies slightly in brightness. It is rotating rapidly with a velocity of 274km/s at the equator. This causes the equator to bulge outward due to centrifugal effects, and, as a result, there is a <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature</b> across the star's photosphere that reaches a maximum at the poles. From Earth, Vega is observed from the direction of one of these poles.|$|E

25|$|Like {{much of the}} British Isles, Stornoway has an Oceanic climate, with {{relatively}} little <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature</b> and damp conditions throughout the year.. Winters are exceptionally mild for such a northerly location (just over 58 degrees north latitude); average nighttime low temperatures in January and February, the coldest months, are above 35 degrees F (2°C)., while daytime high temperatures average about 44 degrees F (7°C). Summers are cool, due to influence from the cool Atlantic Ocean; average daytime high temperatures in July and August are just over 60 degrees F (16°C). Precipitation falls mostly as rain (though snow occasionally falls in winter), and October through January are the wettest months due to frequent, sometimes intense storms from the North Atlantic Ocean, which can bring heavy rain and high winds. April through July represents a markedly drier season, when storm frequency and intensity diminish markedly. On average, May is the driest month in Stornoway, averaging under 2.3 inches (58 mm) of precipitation, while November is the wettest month, averaging nearly 5.7 inches (145 mm).|$|E

Have you {{any other}} {{suggestion}} to offer calculated to enlighten the Committee {{on the subject}} intrusted to them for consideration?--I can only say what my own feelings have been as to my men. I have found particularly that natural history was delightful to them; I think that that has an especial tendency to take their minds off their work, which is what I always try to do, not ambitiously, but reposingly. I should like to add to what I said {{about the danger of}} injury to chefs-d'oeuvre, that such danger exists, not only as to gas, but also the breath, the <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature,</b> the extension of the canvases in a different temperature, the extension of the paint upon them, and various chemical operations of the human breath, the chance of an accidental escape of gas, the circulation of variously damp air through the ventilators; all these ought not to be allowed to affect the great and unreplaceable works of the best masters; and those works, I believe, are wholly valueless to the working classes; their merits are wholly imperceptible except to persons who have given many years of study to endeavor to qualify themselves to discover them; but what is wanting for the working man is historical painting of events noble, and bearing upon his own country; the history of his own country well represented to him; the natural history of foreign countries well represented to him; and domestic pathos brought before him. Nothing assists him so much as having the moral disposition developed rather than the intellectual after his work; anything that touches his feelings is good, and puts new life into him; therefore I want modern pictures, if possible, of that class which would ennoble and refine by their subjects. I should like prints of all times, engravings of all times; those would interest him with their variety of means and subject; and natural history of three kinds, namely, shells, birds, and plants; not minerals, because a workman cannot study mineralogy at home; but whatever town he may be in, he may take some interest in the birds and in the plants, or in the sea shells of his own country and coast. I should like the commonest of all our plants first, and most fully illustrated; the commonest of all our birds, and of our shells, and men would be led to take an interest in those things wholly for their beauty, and for their separate charm, irrespective of any use that might be made of them in the arts. There also ought to be, for the more intelligent workman, who really wants to advance himself in his business, specimens of the manufactures of all countries, as far as the compass of such institutions would allow.|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{performance}} plays a {{major role}} in determining the success or failure of a roof system, and it can be controlled to a high degree by the designer. Thermal considerations in the design of roofs can be divided into two general categories: control of heat loss and heat gain of the space below the roof, and the effects <b>of</b> extremes and <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature</b> on the roof system. In Canadian buildings where temperature control through winter heating and summer cooling is common, heat gain and heat loss are of economic importance.

40|$|As {{a fragile}} construction, a {{granular}} pile is {{very sensitive to}} minute external perturbations. In particular, it is now well established that a granular assembly is sensitive to <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature.</b> Such <b>variations</b> can produce localized rearrangements as well as global static avalanches inside a pile. In this review, we sum up the various observations {{that have been made}} concerning the effect <b>of</b> <b>temperature</b> on a granular assembly.

6000|$|Before {{seeking a}} {{solution}} of the problem thus raised, let us glance at the several minor causes which produce breaks in the geological succession of organic forms; taking first, the more general ones which modify climate, and, therefore, the distribution of life. Among these may be noted one which has not, we believe, been named by writers on the subject. We mean that resulting from a certain slow astronomic rhythm, by which {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres are alternately subject to greater extremes of temperature. In consequence of the slight ellipticity of its orbit, the Earth's distance from the sun varies to the extent of some 3,000,000 of miles. At present, the aphelion occurs at the time of our northern summer; and the perihelion during the summer of the southern hemisphere. In consequence, however, of that slow movement of the Earth's axis which produces the precession of the equinoxes, this state of things will in time be reversed: the Earth will be nearest to the sun during the summer of the northern hemisphere, and furthest from it during the southern summer or northern winter. The period required to complete the slow movement producing these changes, is nearly 26,000 years; and were there no modifying process, the two hemispheres would alternately experience this coincidence of summer with relative nearness to the sun, during a period of 13,000 years. But there is also a still slower change {{in the direction of the}} axis major of the Earth's orbit; from which it results that the alternation we have described is completed in about 21,000 years. That is to say, if at a given time the Earth is nearest to the sun at our mid-summer, and furthest from the sun at our mid-winter; then, in 10,500 years afterwards, it will be furthest from the sun at our mid-summer, and nearest at our mid-winter. Now the difference between the distances from the sun at the two extremes of this alternation, amounts to one-thirtieth; and hence, the difference between the quantities of heat received from the sun on a summer's day under these opposite conditions amounts to one-fifteenth. Estimating this, not with reference to the zero of our thermometers, but with reference to the temperature of the celestial spaces, Sir John Herschel calculates [...] "23° Fahrenheit, as the least <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature</b> under such circumstances which can reasonably be attributed to the actual variation of the sun's distance." [...] Thus, then, each hemisphere has at a certain epoch, a short summer of extreme heat, followed by a long and very cold winter. Through the slow change in the direction of the Earth's axis, these extremes are gradually mitigated. And at the end of 10,500 years, there is reached the opposite state--a long and moderate summer, with a short and mild winter. At present, in consequence of the predominance of sea in the southern hemisphere, the extremes to which its astronomical conditions subject it, are much ameliorated; while the great proportion of land in the northern hemisphere, tends to exaggerate such contrast as now exists in it between winter and summer: whence it results that the climates of the two hemispheres are not widely unlike. But 10,000 years hence, the northern hemisphere will undergo annual variations of temperature far more marked than now.|$|E
