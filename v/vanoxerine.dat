50|$|It {{is likely}} that <b>vanoxerine</b> acts to prevent {{reentrant}} circuits. <b>Vanoxerine</b> terminates atrial flutters and atrial fibrillations (both cardiac abnormal heart rhythms) by blocking the recirculating electrical signal, and preventing the reformation of the reentrant circuit. <b>Vanoxerine</b> has also shown a tendency to reduce the recurrence of cardiac arrhythmias, as it was exceedingly difficult to reproduce an atrial flutter or fibrillation in a subject that had been taking <b>vanoxerine.</b>|$|E
50|$|At this time, {{little is}} known about the {{molecular}} mechanism of <b>vanoxerine,</b> and steps are being made towards understanding how <b>vanoxerine</b> operates on a molecular level.|$|E
5000|$|At a {{cellular}} level, <b>vanoxerine</b> acts to block cardiac ion channels. [...] <b>Vanoxerine</b> is a multichannel blocker, acting on IKr (potassium), L-type calcium and sodium ion channels. [...] By blocking these specific channels, {{there is a}} prolongation of the action potential of the cell, preventing reactivation by a reentrant circuit. The block is strongly frequency dependant: as the pacing of the heart increases so does the frequency of ion channel blocking by <b>vanoxerine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Vanoxerine</b> (GBR-12909) is a {{piperazine}} derivative {{which is}} a potent and selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI). GBR-12909 binds to the target site on the dopamine transporter (DAT) ~ 50 times more strongly than cocaine, but simultaneously inhibits the release of dopamine. This combined effect only slightly elevates dopamine levels, giving <b>vanoxerine</b> only mild stimulant effects. <b>Vanoxerine</b> has also been observed to be a potent blocker of the IKr (hERG) channel. GBR-12909 also binds with nanomolar affinity to the serotonin transporter.|$|E
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: <b>Vanoxerine</b> as a {{treatment}} for cocaine dependence ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Vanoxerine</b> {{has been}} {{researched}} for use in treating cocaine dependence both {{as a substitute for}} cocaine and to block the rewarding effects. This strategy of using a competing agonist with a longer half-life has been successfully used to treat addiction to opiates such as heroin by substituting with methadone. It was hoped that <b>vanoxerine</b> would be of similar use in treating cocaine addiction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vanoxerine</b> {{has been}} through human trials up to Phase II, but {{development}} was stopped due to observed QTc effects {{in the context of}} cocaine use.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} {{benefits}} of <b>vanoxerine</b> {{is that it does}} not appear to cause the same harmful side effects as its most comparable contender, amiodarone.|$|E
5000|$|... 1-Benzyl-4-(2-(diphenylmethoxy)ethyl)piperidine is a {{stimulant}} of the piperidine class {{which acts}} as a potent and selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It {{is closely related to}} <b>vanoxerine</b> and GBR-12,935, which in contrast are piperazines.|$|E
50|$|Research also {{indicates}} that <b>vanoxerine</b> may have additional mechanisms of action including antagonist action at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and {{it has also been}} shown to reduce the consumption of alcohol in animal models of alcohol abuse.|$|E
50|$|DBL-583 is a {{selective}} dopamine reuptake inhibitor of the piperazine chemical class. It is the decanoate ester of a hydroxy <b>vanoxerine.</b> DBL-583 breaks down very {{slowly in the}} body, lasting {{for up to a}} month after a single injection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vanoxerine</b> is a {{potentially}} effective treatment for abnormal heart rhythms. A significant cause of abnormal heart rhythms is reentry, an electrophysiologic event {{in which the}} proliferating signal refuses to terminate, and endures to reexcite the heart after the refractory period.|$|E
5000|$|In {{clinical}} {{human trials}} with increasing dosages, <b>vanoxerine</b> has {{shown to have}} a highly favourable therapeutic index, showing no side effects at concentrations {{much higher than the}} therapeutic dose. [...] In canines, the effective therapeutic dose was between 76 ng/ml and 99 ng/ml, however the drug reached plasma concentrations of 550 ng/ml without harmful side effects, presenting a desirable therapeutic index.|$|E
50|$|Phencyclidine {{and related}} {{drugs such as}} benocyclidine, tenocyclidine, ketamine, and {{dizocilpine}} (MK-801), {{have been shown to}} inhibit the reuptake of the monoamine neurotransmitters. They appear to exert their reuptake inhibition by binding to vaguely characterized allosteric sites on each of the respective monoamine transporters. Benztropine, mazindol, and <b>vanoxerine</b> also bind to these sites and have similar properties. In addition to their high affinity for the main site of the monoamine transporters, several competitive transporter substrates such as cocaine and indatraline have lower affinity for these allosteric sites as well.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vanoxerine</b> is a {{drug that}} {{was in the midst of}} {{recruiting}} participants for a phase III human clinical trial for its use as a cardiac antiarrhythmic when safety concerns arose. It had passed phase IIb human trials without any concerns but the company, Laguna Pharmaceuticals, found safety issues which prompted them to shut down their company and the $30 million effort to produce a new heart medication. It was previously indicated as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease and depression; however, it had no significant benefit with these diseases.|$|E
5000|$|The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) of the U.S. National Institutes of Health is researching modafinil, a {{narcolepsy}} {{drug and}} mild stimulant, {{as a potential}} cocaine treatment. Ibogaine has been under investigation {{as a treatment for}} cocaine dependency and is used in clinics in Mexico, the Netherlands and Canada, but cannot be used legally in the United States. Other medications that have been investigated for this purpose include acetylcysteine, baclofen, and <b>vanoxerine.</b> Medications, such as phenelzine, have been used to cause an [...] "aversion reaction" [...] when administered with cocaine.|$|E
5000|$|Modafinil {{has been}} {{described}} as an [...] "atypical" [...] DAT inhibitor, and shows a profile of effects that is very different from those of other dopaminergic stimulants. For instance, modafinil produces wakefulness reportedly without the need for compensatory sleep, and shows a relatively low, if any, potential for abuse. Aside from modafinil, examples of other atypical DAT inhibitors include <b>vanoxerine</b> and benztropine, which have a relatively low abuse potential similarly to modafinil. These drugs appear to interact molecularly with the DAT in a distinct way relative to [...] "conventional" [...] DAT blockers such as cocaine and methylphenidate.|$|E
5000|$|However, GBR 12909 analogs {{continue}} to be studied as treatments for cocaine addiction. As an example, GBR compounds are piperazine based and contain a proximal and a distal nitrogen. It was found that piperidine analogs are still fully active DRIs, although {{they do not have}} any affinity for the [...] "piperazine binding site" [...] unlike the GBR compounds. Further SAR revealed that while there are 4 atoms connecting the two fluorophenyl rings to the piperazine, the ether in the chain could be omitted in exchange for a tertiary nitrogen. <b>Vanoxerine,</b> a blocker of the dopamine carrier devoid of action on the noradrenaline carrier, while fully increasing dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, is ineffective in raising extracellular dopamine in the prefrontal cortex.|$|E
50|$|In any case, {{there is}} {{nonetheless}} {{a good deal}} of evidence to indicate that modafinil is producing at least a portion of its wakefulness-promoting effects by acting as a DRI, or at least via activation of the dopaminergic system. In support of modafinil acting as a dopaminergic agent, its wakefulness-promoting effects are abolished in DAT knockout mice (although {{it is important to note}} that DAT knockout mice show D1 and D2 receptor and norepinephrine compensatory abnormalities, which might confound this finding), reduced by both D1 and D2 receptor antagonists (although conflicting reports exist), and completely blocked by simultaneous inactivation of both D1 and D2 receptors. In accordance, modafinil shows full stimulus generalization to other DAT inhibitors including cocaine, methylphenidate, and <b>vanoxerine,</b> and discrimination is blocked by administration of both ecopipam (SCH-39166), a D1 receptor antagonist, and haloperidol, a D2 receptor antagonist. Partial substitution was seen with the DRA dextroamphetamine and the D2 receptor agonist PNU-91356A, as well as with nicotine (which indirectly elevates dopamine levels through activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors).|$|E
5000|$|Research {{found that}} {{modafinil}} elevates histamine {{levels in the}} hypothalamus in animals. The locus of the monoamine action of modafinil was also the target of studies, with effects identified on dopamine in the striatum and, in particular, nucleus accumbens, norepinephrine in the hypothalamus and ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, and serotonin in the amygdala and frontal cortex. Modafinil was screened at a large panel of receptors and transporters {{in an attempt to}} elucidate its pharmacology. Of the sites tested, it was found to significantly affect only the dopamine transporter (DAT), acting as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI) with an IC50 value of 4 μM. Subsequently, it was determined that modafinil binds to the same site on the DAT as cocaine, but in a different manner. In accordance, modafinil increases locomotor activity and extracellular dopamine concentrations in animals {{in a manner similar to}} the selective DRI <b>vanoxerine</b> (GBR-12909), and also inhibits methamphetamine-induced dopamine release (a common property of DRIs, since DAT transport facilitates methamphetamine's access to its intracellular targets). As such, [...] "modafinil is an exceptionally weak, but apparently very selective, DAT inhibitor". [...] In addition to animal research, a human positron emission tomography (PET) imaging study found that 200 mg and 300 mg doses of modafinil resulted in DAT occupancy of 51.4% and 56.9%, respectively, which was described as [...] "close to that of methylphenidate". Another human PET imaging study similarly found that modafinil occupied the DAT and also determined that it significantly elevated extracellular levels of dopamine in the brain, including in the nucleus accumbens.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Vanoxerine</b> is an oral, 1, 4 -dialkylpiperazine {{derivative}} antiarrhythmic drug {{being evaluated}} for pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF). OBJECTIVE The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of <b>vanoxerine</b> for the restoration of sinus rhythm in subjects with recent onset AF or atrial flutter (AFL). METHODS RESTORE SR (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single oral dose of <b>vanoxerine</b> for the conversion of subjects with recent onset atrial fibrillation or flutter to normal sinus rhythm) was a prospective, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomized subjects to a single oral dose of <b>vanoxerine</b> 400 mg or placebo (2 : 1 allocation). RESULTS A total of 41 subjects were randomized in the study (placebo [n = 15] and <b>vanoxerine</b> [n = 26]). The study was terminated prematurely because of safety concerns. Overall, 61 % (23 of 38) of the treated cohort had a history of AF/AFL and 66 % (27 of 41) had structural heart disease (SHD). The primary efficacy end point-conversion to sinus rhythm through 24 hours-occurred in 20 % (3 of 15) in the placebo arm vs 69 % (18 of 26) in the <b>vanoxerine</b> arm (P =. 0024). The mean length of stay was 4. 2 +/- 2. 9 days in the placebo arm vs 4. 7 +/- 3. 2 days in the <b>vanoxerine</b> arm (P =. 6561). The primary safety end point (all-cause death, ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia requiring intervention, or torsades de pointes) occurred in no patient in the placebo arm vs 11. 5 % (3 of 26) in the <b>vanoxerine</b> arm. All 3 patients had torsades de pointes and underlying SHD. CONCLUSION <b>Vanoxerine</b> is an oral, mixed ion channel blocker with I-Kr, I-Na, and L-type calcium channel activity. While oral therapy with 400 mg of <b>vanoxerine</b> appears effective for the termination of recent onset AF/AFL, its use was associated with a significant risk of ventricular proarrhythmia in patients with SHD.

40|$|Each of 12 healthy male {{subjects}} received single oral {{doses of}} 100 mg <b>vanoxerine</b> (GBR 12909), a dopamine reuptake inhibitor with potential antidepressant activity, on three different occasions (fasting, after a low-fat meal {{and after a}} high-fat meal) according to a randomized, cross-over design. The mean tmax value increased from 0. 82 h after fasting to 1. 44 h after a low-fat meal and to 2. 46 h after a high-fat meal. Only modest food effects were seen on mean Cmax values (55 nM, 52 nM and 84 nM, after fasting, after the low-fat meal and after the high-fat meal, respectively) but values of AUC {{up to the last}} measurable concentration (AUC(0,t)) increased by 76 % (from 110 to 194 nM h) after the low-fat meal and by 255 % (from 110 to 391 nM h) after the high-fat meal compared with fasting. All of these effects were statistically significant except for the differences in tmax and Cmax between fasting and the low-fat meal. The mechanism of these changes is unclear, but it seems likely that food may lower the first-pass metabolism of <b>vanoxerine,</b> as has been shown for other lipophilic basic drugs...|$|E
40|$|Dopamine is a {{catecholamine}} {{with multiple}} physiological functions, playing {{a key role}} in nervous system; however its participation in reproductive processes and sperm physiology is controversial. High dopamine concentrations have been reported in different portions of the feminine and masculine reproductive tract, although the role fulfilled by this catecholamine in reproductive physiology is as yet unknown. We have previously shown that dopamine type 2 receptor is functional in boar sperm, suggesting that dopamine acts as a physiological modulator of sperm viability, capacitation and motility. In the present study, using immunodetection methods, we revealed the presence of several proteins important for the dopamine uptake and signalling in mammalian sperm, specifically monoamine transporters as dopamine (DAT), serotonin (SERT) and norepinephrine (NET) transporters in equine sperm. We also demonstrated {{for the first time in}} equine sperm a functional dopamine transporter using 4 -[4 -(Dimethylamino) styryl]-N-methylpyridinium iodide (ASP(+)), as substrate. In addition, we also showed that dopamine (1 mM) treatment in vitro, does not affect sperm viability but decreases total and progressive sperm motility. This effect is reversed by blocking the dopamine transporter with the selective inhibitor <b>vanoxerine</b> (GBR 12909) and non-selective inhibitors of dopamine reuptake such as nomifensine and bupropion. The effect of dopamine in sperm physiology was evaluated and we demonstrated that acrosome integrity and thyrosine phosphorylation in equine sperm is significantly reduced at high concentrations of this catecholamine. In summary, our results revealed the presence of monoamine transporter DAT, NET and SERT in equine sperm, and that the dopamine uptake by DAT can regulate sperm function, specifically acrosomal integrity and sperm motility...|$|E
