40|$|So far, {{there have}} been many {{attempts}} to observe <b>travel</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in detail for transportation planning and ITS. One of the promising tools is IC card carried by people. The IC cards as bus tickets (bus smart cards) were introduced in March 2007 in Kanto area in Japan, and the bus smart cards have been in widespread use. The records of the bus smart card data are more than 38 million a month, and can represent the <b>travel</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> In this study, system of the bus smart card data collection in Japan is introduced, and the enormous bus smart card data is visualized for grasping the current transportation situation in the area of interest. In order to establish application of the bus smart card data to transportation planning, plausible analysis methods with the detailed <b>travel</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>people</b> acquired by the bus smart card data are developed. For utilization of the bus smart card data, a method of converting bus smart card data to travel time and bus trip data is developed. The converted empirical data is applied to origin-destination analysis, and average <b>of</b> bus <b>travel</b> time estimation. By using the average bus travel time, relationship between the travel time and traffic congestion are analyzed. Additionally, an integration method of the bus smart card data with probe data is investigated. The integrated empirical data is applied to traffic monitoring, and extraction of obstructive factor for traffic flow. 1...|$|R
40|$|Demographic {{change is}} one {{important}} trend in western societies. Many developed countries {{are characterized by}} declining fertility rates in combination with rising longevity. Fur-thermore, the baby boomer generation has started to retire, so the growing demographic group of the elderly {{becomes more and more}} important. Under these circumstances, mobility issues become very important. Especially for older peo-ple daily outdoor activities are essential not only to maintain physical competence but also for the participation in social and cultural life. With rising age, the physical competence decreases more and more. In this context, gender differences need to be considered. Compared to men, older women are more affected by physical limitations. Hence, the objective of this study is an in-depth analysis <b>of</b> the <b>travel</b> behaviour <b>of</b> elderly <b>people</b> taking into account mobilty impairments using the example of Germany. The empiri-cal analysis is based on the representative Germany-wide mobility survey “Mobility in Germany 2008 ” (funded by the Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs). Findings show that the <b>travel</b> behaviour <b>of</b> elder <b>people</b> depends on age, gender and by the presence of mobilty impairments. Especially mobilty-impaired older women (75 +) experience limitations in their mobility. So spatial and transport planning have to consider the <b>various</b> types <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> behaviour <b>of</b> this heterogeneous group.

3000|$|The {{definition}} of medical tourism varies among researchers {{depending on the}} choice of place and location (domestic or foreign) of medical tourism, the method and procedure applied, application, and/or processes.

The Medical Tourism Association [16] defines medical tourism as “where people who live in one country travel to another country to receive medical, dental and surgical care {{while at the same time}} receiving equal to or greater care than they would have in their own country, and are traveling for medical care because of affordability, better access to care or a higher level of quality of care.” Wongkit and Mckercher [17] defined medical tourism as “the <b>travel</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> to specific destinations to seek medical help that forms the primary purpose of their trip.” [...]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Lymphatic filariasis, {{caused by}} Wuchereria bancrofti is an {{important}} parasitic disease included in the National vector-borne disease control programme in India {{to bring down the}} microfilariae carriage rate and disease prevalence in endemic zones in the country. Unplanned urbanization and frequent <b>travel</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> from non-endemic areas to endemic areas has increased the threat of this infection, even in non-endemic zones. We report a case of a 19 year old girl from Rajasthan (non-endemic state) who came with the complaint of cervical lymphadenopathy. Extensive follow-up of patient with various investigations such as CBC, urine complete, X-ray, CECT neck, Giemsa staining of PBF, FNAC of lymph node and AFB staining of sputum were carried out when a final diagnosis of lymphatic filariasis could be established by demonstrating live, motile microfilariae in EDTA blood sample collected in night hours. Also, Giemsa-stained PBF revealed sheathed microfilariae with cephalic space: breadth ratio of 1 : 1, regularly placed purple-coloured nuclei over the entire length and tail-tip free of nuclei.

40|$|Heavy fog may easily cause traffic accidents; thus freeway {{closures}} {{are frequently}} taken {{in order to}} ensure traffic safety in China, which not only seriously affect the <b>travel</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> but also bring great economic losses. This paper studies the fog related risk of rear-end collisions and the intermittent release measures taken to reduce such risk; meanwhile, an improved cellular automaton model considering driving behaviors in heavy fog is proposed. The simulation results indicate that the risk indicator fa in fog is much higher than normal weather when cellular occupancy ρ< 0. 5. After taking intermittent release measures, the magnitude of fa will drop from 10 − 4 to 10 − 5 under the same fog condition, which greatly enhances the safety. In addition, this paper concludes the appropriate vehicle number released for each time and the time interval ht between adjacent fleets and the maximum number of vehicles max which can be released per hour. These results can be used as theoretical basis and reference for the traffic management departments to develop intermittent release measures...|$|R
