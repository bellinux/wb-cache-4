40|$|Mogo Creek is {{an active}} sand-bed stream that drains a 213 -km 2 basin and flows into a blocked valley lake that {{functions}} as a terminal sediment sink. The blocked valley lake, in turn, discharges into the main stream, Macdonald River. A Gilbert-type fluvial delta has formed where Mogo Creek flows into the lake and a reverse delta has formed where the Macdonald River back floods into the blocked valley lake. The development of the fluvial delta since 1848 has been documented {{from a combination of}} maps, <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> <b>photographs</b> and field surveys. The Mogo Creek fluvial delta prograded into the lake as a series of lobate sand bodies that episodically changed direction over time. Over a 13. 5 -year period 71 700 m 3 of sand (94 600 t) was deposited on the delta plain and in the river channel and 1042 m 3 (1150 t) was deposited on the delta front. Sediment bulk densities were determined so that the total delta depositional mass was computed as 95 790 t or 7095 t/year. Progradation of the delta front has segmented the lake by blocking a former side bay. Topset beds include channel sands and overbank deposits of levee sands, sand splays, chute sands and marsh muds. Foreset beds are delta front sets of planar tabular medium and coarse sands. Bottomset beds are horizontally-laminated prodelta sandy muds grading into massive, low density, lacustrine muds. From our survey of the lake volume, present rates of delta progradation will totally infill the blocked valley lake in 48 years...|$|R

To some extent, data on field geometries providing detailed information on agricultural land use {{can be obtained from}} the Integrated Administration and Control System (InVeKoS) database, which is an important tool for the EU member states to regulate agricultural subsidies. In fact, due to legal restrictions and inconsistencies in data harmonisation which is due to federal responsibilities, this dataset is not available for public use [9]. Based on satellite images, data on land use patterns are offered by the European Topic Centre on Land Use and Spatial Information [20], where the distribution of the CORINE Landcover maps is administrated [21]. Data on the cultivation of crops in Europe are available at the Statistical Office of the European Communities [22], which offers data on various topics, among of which is also agriculture. The main cropping areas of oilseed rape are located in northeast Germany {{as well as in the}} Alsace in France. In these regions, oilseed rape is cultivated on up to 25 % of the arable land. Due to the increased cultivation of energy plants, it can be assumed that the cultivation of maize (biogas) and oilseed rape (biodiesel) will be intensified in the future. For Germany, it can be stated that in 2007, there was an increase in maize cultivation of 9.6 % and of 8.8 % for oilseed rape cultivation compared to those in 2006.|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{of global}} climate change is {{expected}} to be first seen in polar regions, where subtle changes in climate may have large impacts on fragile geomorphic systems. Polar dunes are one such system for which there is little precise information available. For example, the extent to which polar aeolian deposits are stabilized by ice-bonded sands is unknown. As a first step towards {{a better understanding of the}} response of polar desert aeolian systems, we have mapped the sand dunes in Victoria Valley, Antarctica over the past four decades. The dune field is located at the confluence of the Packard and Victoria Valleys and has been the focus of field measurement programs for more than 40 years. Previous studies indicate that dune mobility has been limited to the crests shifting over ice-cemented sand layers within the dune in response to the Valley’s bi-direction wind regime. This is believed to impede net migration of the dune field. Short-term field studies have shown erratic movement of the dunes with the range between – 14 and 62 m. However, no study has been made of longer term change in the morphological character of the dune field. In this study we use <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> <b>photographs</b> and LIDAR data to map dune change over a 43 year period. We assess change in dune position and morphology over time. We find that the dunes have migrated (up to 75 m), and that dune form has changed, principally by lateral coalescing and limb extension. Movement of the dunes suggests that migration is possible despite the presence of ice and snow within the dune core. In addition, these changes support earlier observations that indicate a net (westerly) migration driven by topographically channeled thermally generated easterlies and gradient southeasterly winds. We infer this to indicate that the region has not undergone significant change in weather patterns in the last four decades. This is in agreement with the findings of Ayling and McGowan (2006) who investigated dust deposits on the adjacent Victoria Lower Glacier. Accordingly, it would appear that neither change in weather or climate due to global warming has caused significant change to the meteorology of the Victoria Valley, Antarctica and in-turn its aeolian geomorphic system...|$|R
40|$|During the International Summer School {{students}} and lectures - {{after three days}} theoretical lessons - spend four days into the field collecting geophysical measurement. The archaeological test-site is placed on lowland quite close to Grosseto, the city where the University of Siena recently open a satellite of the Department of Archaeology and History of Arts and where there was the headquarter of the Summer School. The site is a further big roman villa starting form the first century AD that we estimated occupied until the sixth century AD. Grid collection and pottery analysis allow us to recognize the re-occupation of the site during the late ninth and tenth century AD. The site measure about 4 hectares in extent so we decide to focus our attention on four square sample of 50 by 50 meters where we rotated four different geophysical methods: magnetometry (fluxgate, Overhouser, Cesium), ground penetration radar (GPR), electro-magnetometry (EM), electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). 	In this section we repot the work achieved during the Summer School but also we publish the data collected starting from the 2001 when the site has been discovered during the Aerial Archaeology Research School (Culture 2000 project) to the last survey we did in autumn 2007. One intention working on the Aiali test-site is to apply the highest available level and intensity of archaeological prospection methods on a large, complex and stratified site, producing material from the from Etruscan, Roman and Medieval periods. As our good friend Chris Musson has argued – during one of our long discussions on this topic – the archaeological objective and outcome of the Aiali project has {{to take account of}} the critical impact of the kinds of information that are available for recording: to use his own words “in assessing the potential or interpretation of a landscape it is at least as important to know what may not be visible as to appreciate what is visible”. 	The first and in the second chapters of section 2 Stefano Campana introduces the site background and the results obtained through remote sensing tools from Quickbird- 2 satellite imagery, to <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> <b>photographs</b> and aerial survey. In chapter 3 Emanuele Vaccaro and Mariaelena Ghisleni provide the results of field walking survey, grid collection and the detailed study of pottery. Chapter 4 is addressed by Stefano Campana and Salvatore Piro to introduce the geophysical surveys of the site. In the next chapter Helmut Becker, Stefano Campana, Thomas Himmler and Iacopo Nicolosi to discuss the results in the sample areas of different magnetic sensors (Fluxgate, Overhouser And Caesium-Magnetometry). Chapter 6 handles with Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) surveys by Dean Goodman and Salvatore Piro. Chapter 7 discuss the results obtained through the application of electromagnetic survey by Alain Tabbagh while the next one deals with the last methods applied during field work, electrical survey and is summarized by Michel Dabas and Gianfranco Morelli. As conclusion Stefano Campana and Salvatore Piro, an archaeologist and a geophysicist, try to combine all the information together. Through a GIS-based analysis the editors integrate different sources geophysical measurement as well satellite imagery, aerial photograph, archaeological information collected during field walking survey and archaeological knowledge. The critical impact of the work is addressed to show the improvement of available archaeological information {{as a consequence of the}} improvement of the survey methods...|$|R

Through outline of standard communication, its architecture guarantees the compatibility of dialogue between the different site that they shape the net, concurring the sharing of experiences, services, computer science resources and exceeding the physical distance between the customers. The knowledge of the enormous potentialities of Internet has capacities to develop a plan to us that previews the realization of an informative system in net based on a DBMS (Data Base Management System), that is, a distributed system that it allows to record, to update and to extract information from a database of <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> <b>photographs</b> of the Tuscany, managed from an interactive graphical interface. The DBMS is already, for its nature, an instrument that considers the data like one on hand common resource of an organization of various customers, satisfying in this way the more and more obvious requirement of spreading and sharing of the acquaintances. Indispensable property of every DBMS are, in fact: 	the recording, the organization and the management of the data, according to criteria that answer directly to the necessities of the context in which it is developed. 	the spread and the sharing - the customers must be able to approach to one data bank that can be consulted second opportune modalities 	the reliability, therefore the system capacity to conserve the content of the DBMS through rescue functions and restoration. 	the privacy, guaranteed through mechanisms of authorization and shapes of control. It must be, moreover, efficient, that is necessarily able to carry out the operations employing with of resources - space and time - permissible for all the customers, and effective, in a position to rendering the activities of the customers productive. A DBMS is substantially one layer software that insert between the true and own customer and data. Thanks to this intermediate layer the customer and the applications not approach the data therefore as they are registered effectively, that is to their physical representation, but of it they see only one logical representation. That allows to an elevated degree of independence between the applications and the physical memorization of the data. Thanks to these characteristics the applications that are developed can count on one sure, reliable and generally scalable source given. Such property are favorable for applications that use Internet like infrastructure and that they have therefore obvious problems of emergency and scalability. The choice of to insert the DBMS in the net has been, moreover, encouraged from the opportunity to widen in considerable way its attitude to the transmission and usability of the information. The net is a system that puts on hand of the public, in the tightest times, the various acquaintances and therefore allows to consult the documentation and to render it object of critics and interpretations; moreover simple and immediate verification gives to the protection organs the advantage of one. The insertion of the data bank in Internet admits, moreover, the access to the information to a net of customers is capillary diffused in the territory, extending the spreading of the knowledge also to who is not one specialist in the archaeological field. It allows, moreover, the 'popolamento' of the DBMS in real time from not fixed emplacements and you dislocate in various points; concurring the different breaking in experiences in the same data bank, rendering them immediately that can be consulted, and accelerating the process of communication and exchange of the acquaintance...|$|R
40|$|Aerial {{photography}} is especially {{suited to the}} study of vegetation, water resources and shoreline mapping (A. S. O. P, 1968). <b>Air</b> <b>photographs</b> provide a perspective of the earth’s geographical features that are generally readily understood. <b>Air</b> <b>photographs</b> also provide a plan view that can be spatially compared to the knowledge an individual may have about a similar area. For those reasons aerial photographs frequently provide working documents for planners and managers. They are however, limited in spatial accuracy because the images suffer geometric distortions, particularly near photograph margins or when terrain varies in height. Also, a single aerial photograph rarely covers an entire study area. There are manual and computer assisted techniques of joining <b>air</b> <b>photographs</b> and also eliminating the geometric distortions within and between individual photographs. An assembly of aerial photographs is called a photo mosaic. Photo mosaics can be "controlled" or "uncontrolled", the former having the geometric distortions removed. The amount of geometric distortions in an aerial photograph depends on many factors, including the physical optics of the camera and the orientation of the camera at the instant of exposure. Where the optical axis of the camera is near vertical (70 °) and super-wide angle (> 100 °) lenses. Gross distortions of scale occur on individual photographs when terrain slope changes suddenly, as when a scarp, cliff or portion of a mountain is included in the photograph (Maling, 1989).

The retrieval algorithm prescribed here accounts for two major sources of bias: aircraft motion and horizontal wind. The retrieval methodology is evaluated using the aircraft in situ <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> velocity measurements. The standard deviations of the residuals for the retrieved and in situ measured data for an 18 -s time segment are 0. 21 and 0. 24 m s− 1, respectively; the mean {{difference between the two}} is 0. 01 m s− 1. For the studied cases, the total theoretical uncertainty is less than 0. 19 m s− 1 and the actual retrieval uncertainty is about 0. 1 m s− 1. These results demonstrate that the Mie notch technique combined with the bias removal procedure described in this paper can successfully retrieve <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> velocity from airborne radar observations with low spectral broadening due to Doppler fading, which enables new opportunities in cloud and precipitation research. A separate spectral peak due to returns from the cloud droplets is also observed in the same radar Doppler spectra and is also used to retrieve <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> motion. The <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> velocities retrieved using the two different methods agree well with each other, and the correlation coefficient is as high as 0. 996, which indicates that the spectral peak due to cloud droplets might provide another way to retrieve <b>vertical</b> <b>air</b> velocity in clouds when the Mie notch is not detected but the cloud droplets’ spectral peak is discernable.
