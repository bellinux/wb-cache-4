The publication of a book by so many famous contributors would be beyond the means of any commercial publishing firm. His Majesty's Stationery Office sells it to all comers by weight at the very reasonable price of three- and-threepence a copy.|$|E
60|$|The {{leader of}} the {{official}} party—the steady advocate of the churchwardens, and the unflinching supporter of the overseers—is an old gentleman who lives in our row. He owns some half a dozen houses in it, and always walks {{on the opposite side}} of the way, so that he may be able to take in a view of the whole of his property at once. He is a tall, thin, bony man, with an interrogative nose, and little restless perking eyes, which appear to have been given him for the sole purpose of peeping into other people’s affairs with. He is deeply impressed with the importance of our parish business, and prides himself, not a little, on his style of addressing the parishioners in vestry assembled. His views are rather confined than extensive; his principles more narrow than liberal. He has been heard to declaim very loudly in favour of the liberty of the press, and advocates the repeal of the stamp duty on newspapers, because the daily journals who now have a monopoly of the public, never give <b>verbatim</b> <b>reports</b> of vestry meetings. He would not appear egotistical for the world, but at the same time he must say, that there are speeches—that celebrated speech of his own, on the emoluments of the sexton, and the duties of the office, for instance—which might be communicated to the public, greatly to their improvement and advantage.|$|E

50|$|Archie is Wolfe's live-in {{assistant}} {{in the private}} investigation business Wolfe runs out of his comfortable and luxurious New York City brownstone house on West 35th Street. Wolfe rarely leaves the brownstone, so Archie {{does most of the}} actual investigating, followed by reporting his findings to Wolfe, who solves the mystery. Archie is a skilled observer and has trained his memory so that he can make <b>verbatim</b> <b>reports,</b> oral or typewritten, of extended conversations. He claims to be able to type six to seven pages per hour on average, or up to 10 when he needs to hurry (Before Midnight, chapter 11). Because Wolfe is largely ignorant of and uninterested in the logistics of the world outside his house, he relies on Archie for various kinds of information and judgments of a practical nature. Wolfe also turns to Archie for opinions regarding the personalities of the women connected with a case.|$|E

40|$|EU {{parliamentary}} {{debates are}} a complex form of dialogue in that representatives of European citizens delivering monologues during parliamentary sessions are simultaneously {{engaged in a}} dialogue with their colleagues and with the broader public of European citizens. These can watch the online videos of the parliamentary sessions and read the online <b>verbatim</b> <b>reports,</b> i. e. the official written transcripts of the sessions. Linguistically, however, the videos and the <b>verbatim</b> <b>reports</b> differ significantly. The present paper draws on EUROPARL, a corpus I compiled which comprises the speeches delivered in non-native English during 13 parliamentary sittings (about 75, 000 tokens) held in 2006 as transcribed from EP Live- Video and the corresponding <b>verbatim</b> <b>reports</b> (about 69, 000). Previous studies {{of the differences between}} actual speeches and the <b>verbatim</b> <b>reports</b> regarded national parliamentary debates, for example in the U. K. (Slembrouck 1992; Hughes 1996; Mollin 2007) and in Italy (Cortelazzo 1985), thus focusing on speech in native languages. With the exception of Mollin (2007), they were qualitative in nature. The present paper illustrates the results of a quantative, as well as qualitative, analysis on EU parliamentary speeches delivered by non-native speakers of English and the corresponding <b>verbatim</b> <b>reports.</b> It is found that involvement devices (Chafe 1982), i. e. expressions such as ‘I think’, discourse markers like ‘well’, ‘you know’, ‘I mean’, emphasizers such as ‘of course’, ‘indeed’, ‘really’, ‘actually’, ‘definitely’, vague language like ‘thing’, ‘stuff’ and hedges like ‘a little bit’ are reduced. An analysis of ‘I think’ and ‘of course’ indicates that non-native speakers of English in the European Parliament make a skillful use of involvement devices, in an attempt to engage in a dialogue with the addressees {{despite the fact that they}} delivering monologues. Many of these dialogic features are lost in verbatim report, where ideational, rather than interpersonal, meanings are emphasised...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{shows that}} {{many forms of}} {{communication}} which are generally conceived as originals are in fact mediated in various ways and are hybrid in nature. EU parliamentary reports are a case in point. The original oral ST, which is hybrid {{in that it is}} multilingual, is simultaneously interpreted - and thus mediated and recontextualized - by means of a series of relay translations. Speeches delivered in English by non-native speakers are also recontextualized in various ways, which are examined in the paper through a qualitative methodology consisting in the comparison of the <b>verbatim</b> <b>reports</b> and the actual transcription of non-native speakers interventions from the audio-recording of the sitting held on 3 April 2006, the first video-recording available on the EU Parliament website. Findings show that the English of the original oral text is brought to the centre of the written-spoken continuum, thus emphasizing the ideational dimension rather than the interactional one; the language in <b>verbatim</b> <b>reports</b> is made more explicit for the non-participants in the original communicative event and address forms to EU fellow members are normalized. Therefore, in the intralingual mediation process through which the original non-native EU parliamentary discourse is recontextualized in <b>verbatim</b> <b>reports,</b> the translation universal strategies identified by Baker (1996) are clearly recognizable. Such strategies may thus be considered as more general mediation strategies, which are at work not only in translation, but also in intralingual mediatio...|$|E
