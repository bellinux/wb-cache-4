40|$|Recent {{experimental}} {{evidence indicates that}} structural analogs of vinyl <b>chloride</b> namely, <b>vinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> and trichloroethylene, are mutagenic. Carcinogenic response also has been observed in experimental animals following exposure to <b>vinylidene</b> <b>chloride,</b> trichloroethylene, and perchloroethylene.

Likewise, several studies have indicated significant excesses of chromosomal aberrations as well as adverse effects on reproductive function following male exposure to chloroprene. Although reports have indicated an increased incidence of lung and skin cancer among workers occupationally exposed to chloroprene, adequately designed studies have not been carried out which would allow the development of valid inferences regarding its carcinogenicity.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{copolymerisation}} behaviour of acrylonitrile with the monomers methyl acrylate and <b>vinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> respectively. The project arose from reports by workers at Courtauld's Ltd. that the lengths of the sequences of the monomer units in certain copolymers of acrylonitrile and <b>vinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> were longer than predicted by statistical considerations. The copolymerisation of methyl acrylate with acrylonitrile was studied to examine the possibility of a preferential swelling of polymer particles by one monomer during polymerisation. Copolymerisation was carried out in three different solvents, and unsuccessful attempts were made to measure the sequence lengths in the polymers directly using NMR spectroscopy. Only compositional analysis was possible by this means, but measurements of the thermal properties of the polymers indicated that the sequence lengths were short in all cases. It was found that the Alfrey-Lewis copolymerisation equation was obeyed when the reaction was carried out homogeneously in dimethylformamide, but it was not obeyed when it was carried out heterogeneously in hexane or butanol. The copolymerisation of acrylonitrile with <b>vinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> was studied in several different solvents, and also in mixed solvent systems. Sequence lengths were measured by NMR spectroscopy, and were found to be short for all methods of preparation. In no case was the Alfrey-Lewis copolymer equation obeyed, even in those solvent systems for which the reaction was homogeneous. The preparation of copolymers homogeneously in dimethylformamide showed the least deviation from the simple copolymer equation; for some of the systems used the results could be fitted to the equation derived by Merz et al. in which the effect of the penultimate group in the polymer chain is considered. The problems in setting up a model for heterogeneous polymerisation have been discussed...|$|R

Nevertheless, it seems clear that there is no grossly observable interrelation between tumor production and VDC inhalation. As in the case of vinyl chloride, the problem of <b>vinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> (VDC) is of primary importance in the field of environmental health research. <b>Vinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> produces no clear signs of toxicity apart from a reduced growth rate observed in some animal species by Prendergast et al. (1) and the production of several types of liver damage after 3 months exposure (24 hr/day to 47 ppm). At VDC concentrations of 500 ppm, Cage (2) reported that rats exposed to 6 hr/day for 20 days had nose irritation, retarded growth rate, and histologically proven liver cell degeneration. This lesion disappeared when the concentration was lowered to 200 ppm. At this lower concentration a complete autopsy found all organs normal, while in the living animals only a slight nose irritation was observed. Carpenter et al. (3) reported that the LC 50 of VDC is 32, 000 ppm in Sherman rats repeatedly exposed for 4 hr/day. No effects were seen by Norris in rats exposed from 10 to 40 ppm VDC vapors for 30 days (4). The only significant finding in Sprague-Dawley rats exposed for 30 or 90 days to 25 or 75 ppm was a minimal vacuolation of cytoplasm in hepatocytes. This lesion reversed when the animals were removed from VDC exposure. Subsequent interim kills at 6 and 12 months confirmed the occurrence of minimal liver injury...|$|R

These isotherms were shown to exhibit hysteresis. Comparison of the amount of monomer adsorbed at the higher pressures within the above limits, with the amount of krypton required to cover the surface with a monolayer, indicated that multimolecular adsorption occurred. The ascending branches of the isotherms appeared to obey the Freundlich isotherm and the approximate isosteric heats of adsorption calculated from the equilibrium data fell off linearly as the logarithm of the amount of monomer adsorbed increased; as would be expected if the Freundlich isotherm were obeyed. The values of the heats of adsorption found were such that comparison between them and the latent heat of vapourisation of the monomer made it difficult to decide whether the first layer on the surface was chemisorbed or physically adsorbed. (ii) The kinetic data showed that there was always an initial instantaneous adsorption which was reversible towards pressure, followed by a very much slower uptake of monomer.
