In this research, we develop analytical models for fixed-route material-handling systems from two different perspectives: the workcenters?? {{point of view and}} the transporters?? point of view. The state-dependent nature of the transportation time is considered here for more accurate analytical approximation models for material-handling systems. Also, an analytical methodology is developed for analytical descriptions of the impact of several different vehicledispatching policies for material-handling systems. Two different types of vehicledispatching policies are considered. Those are workcenter-initiated <b>vehicle</b> <b>dispatching</b> rules and vehicle-initiated <b>vehicle</b> <b>dispatching</b> rules. For the workcenterinitiated <b>vehicle</b> <b>dispatching</b> rule, the Closest Transporter Allocation Rule (CTAR) was used to assign empty transporters to jobs needing to be moved between various workcenters. On the other hand, four different vehicle-initiated <b>vehicle</b> <b>dispatching</b> rules, Shortest Distance Dispatching Rule (SDR), Time Limit/Shortest DistanceDispatching Rule (TL/SDR), First-Come First-Serve Dispatching Rule (FCFSR), Longest Distance Dispatching Rule (LDR), are used to select job requests from workcenters when a transporter is available. From the models with a queue space limit of one at each workcenter and one transporter, two different types of extensions are considered. First, the queue space limit at each workcenter is increased from one to two while the number of transporters remains at one. Second, the number of transporters in the system is also increased from one to two while maintaining the queue space limit of one at each workcenter. Finally, using a simulation approach, we modified the Nearest Neighbor (NN) heuristic dispatching procedure for multi-load transporters proposed by Tanchoco and Co (1994) and tested for a fixed-route material-handling system. The effects of our modified NN and the original NN transporter dispatching procedures on the system performance measures, such as WIP or Cycle Time were investigated and we demonstrated that the modified NN heuristic dispatching procedure performs better than the original NN procedure in terms of these system performance measures...|$|E

We develop and use two rolling horizon policies to solve real-time vehicle scheduling problems.

We solve a real-time scheduling problem by applying a heuristic to dynamically solve a series of static instances under a rolling horizon policy. A rolling horizon can be seen either as a fixed-time interval in which advance information about loads’ arrivals is available, or as a fixed number of loads which are known to become available in the near future.

40|$|Abstract—When {{accidents}} or disasters happen, {{emergency response}} time is always crucial. Most {{procedures in the}} existing emergency <b>vehicle</b> <b>dispatching</b> systems rely heavily on manual assignments. In this paper, we propose a novel emergency <b>vehicle</b> <b>dispatching</b> system to reduce emergency response time, which includes automatic emergency resource assignment and driving path planning to reduce unnecessary time delay caused by human misjudgment or the delay caused by traffic jam. As the traffic condition varies from time to time, the traffic information employed in the proposed method needs to trace back to several weeks prior to the dispatching time. Furthermore, we also propose a lane reservation scheme for emergency vehicles to minimize the crash risks. Before an emergency vehicle arrives at each road segment, Road Side Units start to disseminate the warning message at suitable time, so that other drivers could {{have enough time to}} take proper actions such as speed acceleration or switching lanes. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can largely reduce the traveling time of emergency vehicles comparing to the shortest path approach with sirens and lights to alert other drivers. With the traveling time as well as emergency resource assignment time being reduced, the emergency rescue teams would gain edges in rescuing lives and property.

40|$|Emergency {{material}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>dispatching</b> and routing (EMVDR) is {{an important}} task in emergency relief after large-scale earthquake disasters. However, EMVDR is subject to dynamic disaster environment, with uncertainty surrounding elements such as the transportation network and relief materials. Accurate and dynamic emergency material dispatching and routing is difficult. This paper proposes an effective and efficient multi-objective multi-dynamic-constraint emergency material <b>vehicle</b> <b>dispatching</b> and routing model. Considering travel time, road capacity, and material supply and demand, the proposed EMVDR model is to deliver emergency materials from multiple emergency material depositories to multiple disaster points while satisfying the objectives of maximizing transport efficiency and minimizing the difference of material urgency degrees among multiple disaster points at any one time. Furthermore, a continuous-time dynamic network flow method is developed to solve this complicated model. The collected data from Ludian earthquake were used to conduct our experiments in the post-quake and the results demonstrate that: (1) the EMVDR model adapts to the dynamic disaster environment very well; (2) considering the difference of material urgency degree, the material loss ratio is − 10. 7 %, but the variance of urgency degree decreases from 2. 39 to 0. 37; (3) the EMVDR model shows good performance in time and space, which allows for decisions to be made nearly in real time.

We propose three heuristic approaches for static VBIT problems (insertion, combined and column generation), extend them to a dynamic, real-time setting and compare their performance over a rolling time horizon. This time horizon can be seen either as a fixed-time interval in which advance information about loads’ arrivals is available, or as a fixed number of loads which are known to become available in the near future. We also propose two dynamic assignment approaches: with and without look-ahead, respectively. Performance (primarily average load waiting time) of the above five dynamic scheduling approaches is compared with two nearest-vehicle-first rules (with and without look-ahead), which are the best <b>vehicle</b> <b>dispatching</b> rules known from literature and which are commonly used in practice.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies three {{public transit}} operations control strategies with automatic vehicle location (AVL) data available. Specifically, holding control, stop-skipping control and <b>vehicle</b> <b>dispatching</b> with swapping are investigated. Moreover, AVL data from Tucson, Arizona are employed {{to investigate the}} methodologies for deriving vehicle operating parameters. The problem of holding vehicles at multiple holding stations can be modeled as a convex mathematical programming problem which can be solved to near optimality by a proposed heuristic. A simulation study on the holding problem suggests that holding control based on the proposed problem formulation can effectively reduce the total passenger cost. Also, multiple holding stations may offer more opportunities to regularize vehicle headways so that holding vehicles at multiple stations can further reduce the passenger cost compared to holding vehicles only at a single station. Stop-skipping is investigated to respond more rapidly to vehicle disruptions occurring {{in the middle of}} a route. Based on a preliminary analysis of the basic stop-skipping policy, a policy alternative is constructed. The stop-skipping strategy is formulated separately for both policies as a nonlinear integer programming problem. The problem solution relies on an exhaustive search method. Another simulation study is conducted to examine how the performance of the two policies change with the passenger distribution pattern, the vehicle disruption location and length, and the vehicle travel time variability. The simulation result suggests selective superiority of the two policies. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>dispatching</b> problem investigates the potential of integrating real-time swapping into the <b>vehicle</b> <b>dispatching</b> strategies at a transit transfer terminal. With a hypothetical study design, simulation is employed again to evaluate the significance of real-time swapping by comparing the performance of a swapping-holding combined strategy with the holding-only strategy. A sensitivity analysis is also employed to compare these two strategies among key transit operating factors. Finally, using three different understandings (assumptions) of vehicle operating behavior, regression methods are proposed for using AVL data to derive the vehicle running speeds and passenger boarding rates, which serve as inputs to the operations control models. The regression results show that the day-specific operating behavior may not be appropriate, and that operating behavior combining both trip-specific and day-specific effects seems to be slightly superior to the trip-specific behavior overall...|$|E
