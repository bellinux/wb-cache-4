Particle release was examined through measurement of changes in effluent particle concentrations, and particle retention was assessed through measurement of the final spatial distribution of particles remaining in the soil columns after the experiments. Particle release curves were simulated using a convection-dispersion model that includes the instantaneous release of the line source. Fitted model parameters were used to gain insights into the mechanisms that control particle retention and release. When the flow <b>velocity</b> <b>increment</b> was 0. 0435  cm/s, the peak concentration of particles decreased with increasing flow velocity until the latter approached a critical level, beyond which the particle concentration increased. Particle wedging and fouling were considered the primary mechanisms that controlled particle retention and release beyond the critical particle velocity. In experiments with large flow velocity increments, small particles exhibited lower particle mass fraction than large particles as particle wedging and fouling increased with particle size. The range of longitudinal dispersivity decreased with an increasing particle size and flow <b>velocity</b> <b>increment.</b> Moreover, the mean particle velocity increased with the mean interstitial fluid velocity. The mean particle velocity profile was highly sensitive to the particle size at low velocity increments.

40|$|Turbulent flows are {{notoriously}} difficult {{to describe and}} understand based on first principles.

A long-standing open issue has been to predict the origins of intermittency and non-Gaussian statistics from the Navier-Stokes equations.

40|$|Intermittency, i. e., extreme {{fluctuations}} {{at small}} scales, causes the deviation of turbulence statistics from Kolmogorov's 1941 theoretical predictions. Intermittency effects are especially strong for Lagrangian statistics. Our {{understanding of how}} Lagrangian intermittency manifests, however, is still elusive. Here, we study the Lagrangian intermittency {{in the framework of}} an exact, yet unclosed probability density function (PDF) equation. Combining this theoretical approach with data from experiments and simulations, no a priori phenomenological assumptions about the structure or properties of the flow have to be made. In this description, the non-self-similar evolution of the <b>velocity</b> <b>increment</b> PDF is determined at all scales by a single function, which is accessible through data from experiments and simulations. This 'intermittency generating function' arises from the dependence of the acceleration of a fluid element on its velocity history, thereby coupling different scales of turbulent motion. Empirically, we find that the intermittency generating function has a simple, approximately self-similar form, which has the surprising implication that Lagrangian intermittency—the absence of self-similarity in the Lagrangian <b>velocity</b> <b>increment</b> statistics—is driven by a self-similar mechanism. The simple form of the intermittency generating function furthermore allows us to formulate a simple model parametrization of the <b>velocity</b> <b>increment</b> PDFs...|$|E

The <b>velocity</b> <b>increment</b> threshold and the manual reaction time (RT) were also measured under similar stimulus conditions. To manipulate observer’s sensitivity to velocity increments, the MEG responses and the psychophysical performances were measured after adaptation to motion in one direction (adapted condition) or alternating directions (control condition). MEG responses evoked by velocity increments peaked at 200 – 290 ms (M 1), and the M 1 amplitudes, especially those obtained for 40 % increments, were correlated with the sensitivities, which are the reciprocal of <b>velocity</b> <b>increment</b> thresholds. Furthermore, motion adaptation enhanced sensitivity to velocity increments and increased the M 1 amplitudes. These results suggest a close correlation between the perceptual <b>velocity</b> <b>increment</b> and the evoked MEG response.

However, moments of order lower than 2 of the absolute values of <b>velocity</b> <b>increments</b> have not been investigated thoroughly for anomaly.

The relative difference between the measured exponents and Kolmogorov's prediction increases as the moment order decreases towards - 1, thus showing that the anomaly that is manifest in high-order moments is present in low-order moments as well. This conclusion provides a motivation for seeking a theory of anomalous scaling as the order of the moment vanishes.
