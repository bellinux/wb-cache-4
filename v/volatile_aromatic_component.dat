40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the optimization of the simultaneous distilla-tion extraction process of <b>volatile</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>components</b> in flue-cured tobacco leaves by single-factor experiments and response surface methodology (RSM). The {{qualitative and quantitative}} ana-lysis of the aroma components was performed by gas chromatog-raphy–mass spectrometry. The single-factor experiments were adopted to investigate the effects of five independent variables (including material/liquid ratio, distillation time, dosage of NaCl, volume of CH 2 Cl 2 and water-bath temperature) on the extraction of aroma components in tobacco. Furthermore, RSM was employed to study the relationship among the five independent variables and their effects on the extraction of aroma components. The {{results showed that the}} optimal extraction conditions were as follows: 1 : 12 ratio of material to solvent, 3. 20 h distillation time, 1 : 1 ratio of NaCl and tobacco, 2 : 1 ratio of CH 2 Cl 2 and tobacco, 608 C water-bath temperature. Under the optimized conditions, the maximum extraction amount of aroma components reached 2. 27 mg/g...|$|R
40|$|The {{content and}} {{composition}} of active ingredients and essential oils in medicinal and aromatic plants have been studied for several decades. The volatile compounds in essential oils have been analysed routinely using gas chromatography (GC) since 1966, and with GC coupled to mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS) since 1978. The 13 rose varieties selected for chemical analysis varied for colour, shape and fragrance. The static headspace solid phase microextraction (sHS-SPME) technique recently developed for sample preparation and sample enrichment was used to study the <b>volatile</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>components.</b> The main <b>volatile</b> compound of a sweet-smelling purple rose {{was found to be}} phenyl ethyl alcohol (33 - 52 %). The phenyl ethyl alcohol content of fragrant rose flowers with blackish-purple petals increased continuously from early summer to late autumn (from 17 to 70 %). The dominant <b>aromatic</b> <b>components</b> of the yellow, orange and pink rose flowers were hexanol, hexenyl acetate and benzyl alcohol. Phenyl ethyl alcohol and orcinol dimethyl ether were the main constituents of the fragrant pink and white rose varieties. Methyl vinyl anisol and orcinol dimethyl ether were dominant in rose flowers with beige petals. In summary, it can be concluded that the SPME-GC/MS method is suitable for the characterization of rose varieties and for the chemical analysis of <b>aromatic</b> <b>volatile</b> compounds...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Msc (Viticulture and Oenology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Among {{the factors}} {{contributing}} to wine complexity and quality, wine aroma {{is one of the}} most important factors. Wine aroma is the outcome of interaction among different compounds produced from the grapes, during fermentation as well as during the ageing process. Apart from its origin from grapes, fungi and yeasts, wine aroma can also be derived from the metabolic activity of wine lactic acid bacteria (LAB). These microorganisms are usually associated with malolactic fermentation (MLF) which normally occurs after alcoholic fermentation. MLF is beneficial to wine due to its contribution to deacidification, microbiological stabilisation and wine aroma formation, with the latter being the most important area of interest in our study. The production of <b>volatile</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>components</b> in wine can, in part, be achieved through the hydrolytic action of enzymes produced by LAB associated with wine. These enzymes include β-glucosidase, protease, esterase, lipase and glucanase. Most of the work done on bacterial enzymes has been on LAB from food sources other than wine, in which these enzymes contribute to the flavour development of some cheeses, yoghurt and other fermented foods. The activity of these enzymes during wine fermentation has mostly been concerned with β-glucosidase from Oenococcus oeni. Only in recent years has there been a renewed interest in evaluating the activity of β-glucosidase in other genera of wine LAB. The overriding goal of this study was to screen and characterise wine-related enzymes produced by LAB associated with wine. All the LAB isolates tested in this study were obtained from IWBT culture collection and were previously isolated from five different wineries situated in the Western Cape region, South Africa. We first screened isolates using classical methods. The isolates were grown on agar medium supplemented with appropriate substrate analogues in order to evaluate the activity of enzymes (i. e. β- glucosidase, glucanase, lipase and esterase). The colonies exhibiting enzymatic activity [...] ...|$|R
30|$|Antimicrobial, {{antiseptic}} and antifungal {{and even}} anti-Candida properties of essential oils are often ascribed to their main <b>volatile</b> and <b>aromatic</b> terpenic <b>components</b> such as eugenol, thymol or carvacrol (CAR) (Braga et al. 2008; Pavel et al. 2010; Williams et al. 2011). Antifungal and anti-Candida biofilm properties of CAR {{have already been}} highlighted in a study from the laboratory (Dalleau et al. 2008). Regardless of the intensive research currently pursued on terpenes, their precise mechanisms of action remain slightly characterized (Gutierrez et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2008). In general, CAR has a fungicidal activity (namely by killing cells once {{in contact with the}} surface) on C. albicans (Ahmad et al. 2011; Braga et al. 2008).|$|R

30|$|Among major {{aromatic}} rice cultivars, {{although they}} carry the same aromatic allele of AMADH, considerable variation in 2 AP content was reported, for example, in Basmati rice (0.34  ppm), Jasmine rice (0.81  ppm) and Texmati rice (0.53  ppm) (Goufo et al. 2010; Gaur et al. 2016). Environmental factors {{will always have}} a strong influence on the synthesis and degradation of 2 AP content, resulting in quantitative variation of 2 AP in rice grains. Additionally, other volatile compounds may add flavors to the pandan-like aroma. Analysis of <b>volatile</b> <b>aromatic</b> compounds during grain ripening identified odor-active compounds (OAC), including 2 AP, decanal, pentanal, phenylacetaldehyde, hexanal, (E)- 2 -nonenal, nonanal, heptanal, 1 -octanol, 1 -octen- 3 -ol, and 2 -pentylfuran as contributors toward the unique sensory of specific rice fragrance (Hinge et al. 2016). Also, terpenoids, another class of <b>volatile</b> <b>aromatic</b> compounds found mostly in herbs, were identified in rice bran from purple, red, and brown rice varieties (Chumpolsri et al. 2015). Also, in the rice bran extracts of KDML 105, major terpenoid odorants were found, such as limonene, trans-b-ocimene, b-cymene, and linalool (Chumpolsri et al. 2015).
