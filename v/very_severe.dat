5|$|After {{the storm}} {{maintained}} peak winds {{for about six}} hours, the IMD downgraded Gonu to <b>very</b> <b>severe</b> cyclonic storm status late on June 4. Its eye became cloud-filled and ragged, and the cyclone gradually weakened due to cooler water temperatures and drier air as it approached the Arabian Peninsula. Due to land interaction with Oman, the inner core of deep convection rapidly weakened, and {{over a period of}} 24hours the intensity decreased by 95km/h (60mph). According to the IMD, Cyclone Gonu crossed the easternmost tip of Oman still as a <b>very</b> <b>severe</b> cyclonic storm early on June 6. Although the winds continued to gradually decrease, overall organization increased slightly in the hours prior to landfall; Gonu maintained a well-defined low-level structure with a weak eye.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, a {{tropical}} cyclone officially called <b>Very</b> <b>Severe</b> Cyclonic Storm BOB 01 produced the worst flooding in Sri Lanka in 56years. The first storm of the 2003 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, it {{developed over the}} Bay of Bengal on May10. Favorable environmental conditions allowed the system to intensify steadily while moving northwestward. The storm reached peak maximum sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) on May13, making it a <b>very</b> <b>severe</b> cyclonic storm according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the basin. The cyclone drifted north over the central Bay of Bengal, gradually weakening due to heightened wind shear. Turning eastward, the storm deteriorated to a deep depression on May 16 before it curved northeastward and re-intensified into a cyclonic storm. It came ashore in western Myanmar and dissipated over land the following day.|$|E
5|$|After peak intensity, Chapala {{skirted the}} Yemeni island of Socotra on 1November.

After bypassing northern Somalia, Chapala weakened further {{and turned to the}} west-northwest. Early on 3November, the storm made landfall near Mukalla, Yemen, as a <b>very</b> <b>severe</b> cyclonic storm, making it the strongest storm on record to strike the nation.

5|$|Late on June 3, the IMD {{upgraded}} {{the storm}} to <b>Very</b> <b>Severe</b> Cyclonic Storm Gonu. With warm waters, low amounts of vertical wind shear, and favorable upper-level outflow, Gonu strengthened further to attain peak 1-min sustained winds of 270km/h (165mph) and gusts to 315km/h (195mph), about 285km (175mi) east-southeast of Masirah Island {{on the coast}} of Oman. The IMD upgraded it to Super Cyclonic Storm Gonu late on June 4, with peak 3-min sustained winds reaching 240km/h (150mph) and an estimated pressure of 920mbar. This made it the first super cyclonic storm in the Arabian Sea on record.|$|E

5|$|As {{the wind}} shear decreased, the {{convection}} increased further, and the IMD upgraded {{the system to}} a deep depression at 00:00UTC on June1. Later that day, the system began rapidly intensifying while moving on a northwest trajectory; the IMD upgraded the system to a cyclonic storm at 09:00UTC, naming it Phet. An eye became evident during a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) pass of the storm; its appearance {{and the development of}} rainbands showed Phet was intensifying. Late on June1, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, estimating 1minute maximum sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph), after the eye became better defined and the tightly-curved thunderstorm activity. The IMD upgraded Phet to severe cyclonic storm status at 00:00UTC on June2, and further to a <b>very</b> <b>severe</b> cyclonic storm six hours later.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} damaged in the engagement, {{although}} Saumarez's damage was almost entirely confined to his rigging: very few shots had actually struck his hull during the battle, {{and the only}} one that provoked notice passed across the deck without causing injury and struck a cannon on the opposite site, setting it off {{in the direction of a}} number of small gunboats that were approaching from the shore. Casualties on Crescent were equally light, with just one man injured; he had been standing too close to his own cannon during the opening broadside and had been struck by the recoiling gun, suffering a broken leg. Damage and losses on the French ship were <b>very</b> <b>severe,</b> with the rigging in tatters, the hull and lower masts repeatedly struck and casualties that Saumarez initially estimated at more than 120 men killed or wounded, although French accounts give the lower figure of 33 killed and 48 wounded.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Gonu set several {{intensity}} records. When {{it became}} a <b>very</b> <b>severe</b> cyclonic storm on June 3, Gonu became the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the Arabian Sea. Later, it became the only super cyclonic storm, which is a tropical cyclone with 3-minute sustained winds of at least 220km/h (140mph), in the region. The JTWC estimated peak winds of 270km/h (165mph). Based on their estimate, Gonu was tied with the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone for the strongest tropical cyclone in the entire northern Indian Ocean, and had the highest windspeed of any cyclone in this basin. On June 6, Gonu made landfall in extreme eastern Oman with winds of 150km/h (90mph), making it the strongest tropical cyclone on record to strike the Arabian Peninsula. With a damage total of $4.2billion (2007USD) and 50deaths, Gonu became the worst natural disaster on record in Oman. Additionally, the storm was only the second cyclonic storm on record to strike Iran, the other doing so on June 4, 1898.|$|E
5|$|Homozygous FH {{is harder}} to treat. The LDL receptors are {{minimally}} functional, if at all. Only high doses of statins, often {{in combination with other}} medications, are modestly effective in improving lipid levels. If medical therapy is not successful at reducing cholesterol levels, LDL apheresis may be used; this filters LDL from the bloodstream in a process reminiscent of dialysis. <b>Very</b> <b>severe</b> cases may be considered for a liver transplant; this provides a liver with normally functional LDL receptors, and leads to rapid improvement of the cholesterol levels, but at the risk of complications from any solid organ transplant (such as rejection, infections, or side-effects of the medication required to suppress rejection). Other surgical techniques include partial ileal bypass surgery, in which part of the small bowel is bypassed to decrease the absorption of nutrients and hence cholesterol, and portacaval shunt surgery, in which the portal vein is connected to the vena cava to allow blood with nutrients from the intestine to bypass the liver.|$|E
5|$|In extreme western Cuba, {{damage was}} <b>very</b> <b>severe</b> from the strong winds, likened {{to the impact}} of a tornado.

In the latter location, around a dozen people were killed, 50 were injured, and nearly every building in the town was severely damaged; heavy losses also occurred to the tobacco crop. Across western Pinar del Río Province, the hurricane destroyed all communication links. Further from the center, the capital city of Havana recorded southerly winds of 72mph (116km/h), as well as a minimum pressure of about 999mbar (29.50inHg). Around the country, the hurricane capsized several ships, primarily fishing vessels. The death toll in the country was estimated at around 90. In the days after the storm, Cuban President Zayas authorized about $30,000 in relief aid to send to hurricane victims in Pinar del Río.|$|E

5|$|Secondary {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, {{occur in}} individuals with significant underlying lung disease. Symptoms in SSPs {{tend to be}} more severe than in PSPs, as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs. Hypoxemia (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is usually present and may be observed as cyanosis (blue discoloration of the lips and skin). Hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause confusion and – if <b>very</b> <b>severe</b> – may result in comas. The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|The 1995 India cyclone was a {{tropical}} cyclone that struck southeastern India which later spawned a rare snowstorm in Nepal, triggering the deadliest mountain trekking {{incident in the}} country's history in November 1995. The storm originated from the monsoon trough on November7 in the Bay of Bengal, east of India, becoming the penultimate storm of the 1995 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. Moving northwestward, the system gradually intensified while moving toward land, eventually developing an eye {{in the middle of}} the convection. Reaching peak winds of at least 120km/h (75mph), the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the system as a <b>very</b> <b>severe</b> cyclonic storm on November8, in line with intensity estimates from the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). On November9, the cyclone made landfall near the border of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. Atypical for most November storms, the system continued to the north and dissipated over Nepal on November11.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 India cyclone was {{the second}} strongest {{tropical}} cyclone, in terms of barometric pressure, to form in the Arabian Sea on record; only Cyclone Gonu in 2007 was stronger. The storm originated from a tropical disturbance that formed east of Somalia on May18. Over the following few days, the system gradually organized into a tropical depression. Tracking eastward, towards the coastline of southwestern India, the storm slowly intensified. Shortly before reaching shore, the system turned north and later west, away from land. After taking this turn, the storm intensified into a <b>very</b> <b>severe</b> cyclonic storm, attaining its peak intensity on May24 with winds of 215km/h (135mph 3-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 932mbar (hPa). At the time, this ranked the cyclone as the strongest known storm in the Arabian Sea.|$|E
