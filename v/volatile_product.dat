40|$|This {{study has}} used proton {{transfer}} reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) for direct air analyses of <b>volatile</b> <b>products</b> {{resulting from the}} reactions of ozone with human skin lipids. An initial series of small-scale in vitro and in vivo experiments were followed by experiments conducted with human subjects in a simulated office. The latter were conducted using realistic ozone mixing ratios (≈ 15 ppb with occupants present). Detected products included mono- and bifunctional compounds that contain carbonyl, carboxyl, or α-hydroxy ketone groups. Among these, three previously unreported dicarbonyls have been identified, and two previously unreported α-hydroxy ketones have been tentatively identified. The compounds detected in this study (excepting acetone) have been overlooked in surveys of indoor pollutants, reflecting {{the limitations of the}} analytical methods routinely used to monitor indoor air. The results are fully consistent with the Criegee mechanism for ozone reacting with squalene, the single most abundant unsaturated constituent of skin lipids, and several unsaturated fatty acid moieties in their free or esterified forms. Quantitative product analysis confirms that squalene is the major scavenger of ozone at the interface between room air and the human envelope. Reactions between ozone and human skin lipids reduce the mixing ratio of ozone in indoor air, but concomitantly increase the mixing ratios of <b>volatile</b> <b>products</b> and, presumably, skin surface concentrations of less <b>volatile</b> <b>products.</b> Some of the <b>volatile</b> <b>products,</b> especially the dicarbonyls, may be respiratory irritants.

5000|$|Molecular zinc(II) hydride, ZnH2, was {{recently}} {{identified as a}} <b>volatile</b> <b>product</b> of the acidified reduction of zinc ions with sodium borohydride. This reaction {{is similar to the}} acidified reduction with lithium aluminium hydride, however a greater fraction of the generated zinc(II) hydride is in the molecular form. This can be attributed to a slower reaction rate, which prevents a polymerising concentration of building over the progression of the reaction. This follows earlier experiments in direct synthesis from the elements. The reaction of excited zinc atoms with molecular hydrogen in the gas phase was studied by Breckenridge et al using laserpump-probe techniques. Owing to its relative thermal stability, molecular zinc(II) hydride is included in the short list of molecular metal hydrides, which have been successfully identified in the gas phase (that is, not limited to matrix isolation).|$|E

G(fracture) = 10. 7 for poly(butene- 1 sulfone) at 0 ° and 9. 8 for poly(hexene- 1 sulfone) at 30 °, both in vacuo. The values of G(fracture) were higher for irradiation in air. The main <b>volatile</b> <b>product</b> at 0 ° was sulfur dioxide, in comparable yield to G(fracture), suggesting specificity of C-S fracture and stabilization of main-chain fracture by SO 2 elimination.

40|$|The {{photodegradation}} at 157 nm of {{thin films}} {{of a series}} of Teflon AF copolymers has been comprehensively examined using electron spin resonance, NMR, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopies, mass spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The mechanism of degradation involves reaction at the dioxole units, and as a consequence the sensitivity to degradation increases across the series Teflon AF 1200, 1600, and 2400. A major <b>volatile</b> <b>product</b> is hexafluoroacetone formed by degradation at the dioxole unit. NMR and <b>volatile</b> <b>product</b> analysis confirm that degradation occurs largely at the dioxole unit leading to an array of new chain-end species. Main-chain and chain-end carbon-centered radicals were identified as arising from abstraction reactions and main-chain cleavage, respectively. In addition to loss of the dioxole units, XPS analysis indicates extensive char formation at the film surface, providing evidence of loss of fluorine atoms which in turn may react with free radical intermediates to form stable products identified by NMR.

Pyrolysis of oil shale, LDPE and co-pyrolysis of oil shale-LDPE blend of the total carbon ratio of 1 : 1 were performed by using the fast pyrolysis method in an isothermal pyrolysis reactor. <b>Volatile</b> organic <b>products</b> eluted from the reactor were collected at different tempera-tures and time intervals by using a special sampling technique.
