2500|$|There {{are many}} meat dishes on Madeira, {{one of the}} most popular being espetada. Espetada is {{traditionally}} made of large chunks of beef rubbed in garlic, salt and bay leaf and marinated for 4 to 6 hours in Madeira wine, red wine vinegar and olive oil then skewered onto a bay laurel stick and left to grill over smouldering wood chips. These are so integral a part of traditional eating habits that a special iron stand is available with a T-shaped end, each branch of the [...] "T" [...] having a slot in the middle to hold a brochette (espeto in Portuguese); a small plate is then placed underneath to collect the juices. The brochettes are very long and have a <b>V-shaped</b> <b>blade</b> in order to pierce the meat more easily. It is usually accompanied with the local bread called bolo do caco.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the groove}} {{formed by the}} <b>V-shaped</b> <b>blade,</b> there are two thin wires leading from {{the far end of}} the blade to a {{connector}} in the bellguard. These wires are held in place with a strong glue. The amount of glue is kept to a minimum as in the unlikely (but possible) case that a fencer manages a touch in that glue, the touch would be registered on the electrical equipment, as the glue is not conductive (the blade is grounded). In the event of tip to tip hits, a point should not be awarded. A [...] "body cord" [...] with a three-pronged plug at each end is placed underneath the fencer's clothing and attached to the connector in the bellguard, then to a wire leading to the scoring box. The scoring box signals with lights (one for each fencer) and a tone each time the tip is depressed.|$|E
40|$|Permanent {{tattooing}} due {{to blast}} injuries {{is a rare}} condition. Treatment with various different methods often yields unsatisfactory results. An innovative way to remove permanent traumatic tattoos is presented. A normal curettage blade is simply compressed with a pincer {{in order to create}} the new device. This <b>V-shaped</b> <b>blade</b> was used for surgical excision of the particles. No suture material or special dressing was used. Four patients with multiple explosive tattoos on the face were treated with the V-shaped knife. Due to the ease and speed of this method up to 300 particles were removed in one session. Histological analysis of the tissue samples showed deep dermal and subcutaneous particle location. At follow-up transient hypopigmentation but only minimal scarring was seen. Patients suffered less from itching, a chief complaint preoperatively, and aesthetic appearance of the facial skin was improved. In conclusion, treatment of traumatic tattoos with the V-shaped knife is effective, results in minimal scaring and restores the natural colour of the skin because the particle is completely removed. It is a promising method for treating multiple deep skin inclusions...|$|E

25|$|Wind power first {{appeared}} in Europe during the Middle Ages. The first historical records of their use in England date to the 11th or 12th centuries and {{there are reports of}} German crusaders taking their windmill-making skills to Syria around 1190. By the 14th century, Dutch windmills were in use to drain areas of the Rhine delta. Advanced wind turbines were described by Croatian inventor Fausto Veranzio. In his book Machinae Novae (1595) he described vertical axis wind turbines with curved or <b>V-shaped</b> <b>blades.</b>|$|R
50|$|His {{areas of}} {{interest}} in engineering and mechanics were broad. Mills were one of his main point of research, where he created 18 different designs. He envisioned windmills with both vertical and horizontal axes, with different wing constructions to improve their efficiency. The idea of a mill powered by tides incorporated accumulation pools filled with water by the high tide and emptied when the tide ebbed, simply using gravity; the concept has just recently been engineered and used. The first wind turbines were described by Fausto Veranzio. In his book Machinae Novae (1595) he described vertical axis wind turbines with curved or <b>V-shaped</b> <b>blades.</b>|$|R

[...] MOWAG Roland vehicles for police units typically {{do not have}} a gun, but are equipped with a siren, blue light, searchlight, loud speakers and a <b>V-shaped</b> dozer <b>blade.</b>|$|R
5000|$|B. robustus is {{native to}} North America, {{where it can be}} found along the eastern and {{southern}} coasts from Nova Scotia south to Florida and along the Gulf coastline to Tabasco. It is also known in California, Bermuda, the Bahamas and northern South America. It is most often a coastal species, occurring in wet habitat such as marshes in brackish and saltwater. It is a perennial herb growing from a rhizome system with associated tubers. The erect stems are three-angled, the angles rough with short hairs. They reach well over a meter in maximum height. The leaves sheath the stem and have long, flat or <b>v-shaped</b> <b>blades.</b> The inflorescence bears one or more clusters of many spikelets as well as long, leaflike bracts.|$|R
50|$|The Savonius {{wind turbine}} {{was invented by}} the Finnish {{engineer}} Sigurd Johannes Savonius in 1922. However, Europeans had been experimenting with curved blades on vertical wind turbines for many decades before this. The earliest mention is by the Italian Bishop of Czanad, Fausto Veranzio, who was also an engineer. He wrote in his 1616 book Machinae novae about several vertical axis wind turbines with curved or <b>V-shaped</b> <b>blades.</b> None of his or any other earlier examples reached the state of development made by Savonius. In his Finnish biography there is mention of his intention to develop a turbine-type similar to the Flettner-type, but autorotationary. He experimented with his rotor on small rowing vessels on lakes in his country. No results of his particular investigations are known, but the Magnus effect is confirmed by KÃ¶nig. The two Savonius patents: US1697574, filed in 1925 by Sigurd Johannes Savonius, and US1766765, filed in 1928.|$|R
40|$|Enterprise {{costs and}} returns vary over farms {{and over time}} for any {{particular}} farm. Variability stems from differences in: Capital, labor, land and management resources Type and size of machinery complement Cultural practices Size of farm and enterprise Crop yields Input prices Commodity prices Costs can also be calculated differently depending on the intended use of the cost estimate. The information in this publication represents costs and returns of a case study Adams County, Washington farmer using both the low-disturbance V-sweep undercutter conservation tillage * and traditional tillage systems for summer fallow. To avoid drawing unwarranted conclusions from this case study, you should closely examine the assumptions and data used. If these are not suitable for the situation at hand, you should make appropriate adjustments. *The Haybuster TM undercutter implement {{used in this study}} has 32 -inch wide <b>V-shaped</b> <b>blades</b> with 28 -inch spacing between blades (on two tiers) to slice below the soil surface with minimum soil lifting. As a primary spring tillage implement, the undercutter completely severs capillary pores to halt liquid water movement towards the soil surface as required to retain seed-zone moisture in summer fallow. The pitch of each blade can be individually adjusted to ensure uniform horizontal movement (i. e., minimum soil lifting) underneath the soil. This implement can be easily fitted to deliver aqua nitrogen fertilizer at the time of primary spring tillage. Depending on soil texture, farmers may or may not want to attach a finishing implement behind the undercutter to break large soil clods and fill air voids. In addition, the undercutter works well for killing Russian thistles, if needed, after wheat harvest...|$|R
