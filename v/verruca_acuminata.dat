The information was obtained from the survey, the dermatological examination, and the clinical charts. The sample was made up of 43 patients, in which males and 31 to 40 age groups prevailed. There were no important quantity differences between the seropositive number and AIDS cases. The 27, 9 % had dermatosis that made suspect the presence of the chronic retrovirus. The viral and the mycotic diseases were the most frequent ones, being the neoplastic type and drug reactions the least frequent ones. Other sexually transmitted diseases (STD) appeared associated to the primary disease, mainly herpes simplex type II, and <b>verruca</b> <b>acuminata.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Epigen&# 174; (Laboratorios Cheminova International) {{represents}} an up-to-date preparation {{the development of}} which resulted from the experience obtained {{in the field of}} traditional medicine. Its excellent antiviral properties have been repeatedly proven by many studies. The indications of and methods: 55 patient are as follows: herpes simplex-labialis, genitalis (vulvovaginitis herpetica, balanopostitis herpetica), herpes simplexrecidivans, zoster, HPV infections - <b>verrucae,</b> condylomata <b>acuminata.</b> Material and methods: 55 patients diagnosed with herpes simplex-labialis, genitalis (vulvovaginitis herpetica, balanopostitis herpetica), herpes simplexrecidivans, zoster and condylomata acuminata were being observed at six departments of dermatovenereology as part of an international multicentre study. The series of patients consisted of 26 men (with the average age of 38. 5) and 29 women (with the average age of 40. 5). The youngest patient was a 12 -year-old boy with herpes simplex, the oldest patient was a 78 -year-old woman with zosterfacialis. The most numerous group of patients consisted of individuals with herpes simplex and herpes simplex recidivans amountmg to the total of 24 patients. Results: 11 relapses were recorded. The tolerability of the preparation Epigen&# 174; was very good in all patients, none of the patients had to discontinue the therapy and no adverse effects were recorded. Even patients with disease relapses spontaneously decided to continue with the application of Epigen&# 174; after the termination of the study. The application of Epigen&# 174; has significantly accelerated the healing process in local manifestations. The application of Epigen&# 174; spray or cream in patients with herpetic infections was followed by desiccation of vesicles without crust formation, which significantly reduced the abuse of analgesics. The effect was excellent in minor manifestations of condylomata acuminata. The treatment of more extensive condylomata manifestations requires a combination of Epigen&# 174; application and cryotherapy. Conclusions: Epigen&# 174; cream and spray is a clear contribution to the portfolio of topically employed dermatologie agents...|$|R
