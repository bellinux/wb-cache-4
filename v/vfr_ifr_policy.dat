The runway is illuminated and can handle evening flight operations (although rare), using <b>VFR</b> or <b>IFR</b> flight rules, while approximation instruments are based on PI locators. The installation of an ILS system was adjudicated around 2010.|$|R
40|$|The first {{in-flight}} flying qualities experiment {{using the}} variable stability X- 22 A aircraft investigated longitudinal flying qualities requirements for STOL aircraft in terminal area operations. Emphasis {{was placed on}} defining minimum requirements for the short-term response in <b>VFR</b> and <b>IFR</b> landing approaches at representative steep STOL approach conditions of 65 and 80 knots. Evaluation flights were conducted in negligible and moderate turbulence {{for a wide range}} of short-term frequencies and dampings. The results were compared with the short-term requirements of MIL-F- 83300. The specified Level 1 and 2 VFR boundaries were found to be approximately valid in moderate turbulence for both <b>VFR</b> and <b>IFR</b> flight conditions. In negligible turbulence, the specified VFR Level 2 boundary was also approximately valid but the Level 1 boundary was found to be too stringent. Pilot rating gradients with damping were more apparent than with frequency for the range investigated...|$|R

A number of selectable options allow the pilot to easily customize the detail level of the moving map. Selectable map overlays include: ...|$|R
50|$|Generally, VMC {{requires}} greater {{visibility and}} cloud clearance in controlled airspace than in uncontrolled airspace. In uncontrolled airspace {{there is less}} risk of a VFR aircraft colliding with an instrument flight rules (IFR) aircraft emerging from a cloud, so aircraft are permitted to fly closer to clouds. An exception to this rule is class B airspace, in which ATC separates VFR traffic from all other traffic (<b>VFR</b> or <b>IFR),</b> which is why in class B airspace lower cloud clearance is permitted.|$|R
50|$|The M26 Iskierka was {{conceived}} as an economical plane for civilian pilot training and primary selection of military pilots. It offers training in both <b>VFR</b> and <b>IFR</b> flying and aerobatics. Its construction is partly {{based upon the}} twin-engine PZL M-20 Mewa utility plane (Piper Seneca II, built under licence in WSK-Mielec). It shares the vertical stabilizer, rudder and main landing gear with the Mewa, while the wings and tail part of fuselage are unified to some degree. The plane is constructed according to FAR-23 rules. The main designer was Krzysztof Piwek.|$|R
50|$|It is {{essential}} to differentiate between flight plan type (<b>VFR</b> or <b>IFR)</b> and weather conditions (VMC or IMC). While current and forecast weather may {{be a factor in}} deciding which type of flight plan to file, weather conditions themselves do not affect one's filed flight plan. For example, an IFR flight that encounters visual meteorological conditions (VMC) en route does not automatically change to a VFR flight, and the flight must still follow all IFR procedures regardless of weather conditions. In the US, weather conditions are forecast broadly as VFR, MVFR (Marginal Visual Flight Rules), IFR, or LIFR (Low Instrument Flight Rules).|$|R
5000|$|Ground Communications Outlets (GCO) {{have been}} {{installed}} at some U.S. airports {{to provide a}} means for pilots {{on the ground to}} communicate with Flight Service Stations and Air Traffic Control (ATC) facilities for the purpose of filing, opening and closing <b>VFR</b> or <b>IFR</b> flight plans; obtaining weather briefings and clearances; and similar communications. Larger facilities instead have a remote communications outlet (RCO) installed, which allows pilots to communicate directly over a remote radio transmitter/receiver with the facility. A GCO instead connects with the aircraft/pilot via a radio transmitter/receiver, but with the ground facility via a telephone connection.|$|R
25|$|They are low wing, T-tail {{airplanes}} with cabin pressurization, {{powered by}} two rear mounted turbofans. The landing gear is fully retractable {{and designed to}} be operated on paved runways only. The glass cockpit includes four multi-function displays. The operation is made through a flight management system with autopilot, autothrottle and closed-loop control and monitoring of flight controls Fly-By-Wire. The aircraft are certified for Day, Night, <b>VFR</b> and <b>IFR</b> flights, and are approved for reduced vertical separation minima (RVSM) airspace and flight into known icing conditions, extended flight over water, Category II ILS, operations at high altitude airports up to 13800ft and steep approach operations.|$|R
50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board in {{a report}} adopted July 15, 1970, {{released}} the following Probable Cause:The Board determines the probable cause of this accident to be the deficiencies in the collision avoidance capability of the Air Traffic Control system of the Federal Aviation Administration in a terminal area wherein there was mixed instrument flight rules (IFR) and visual flight rules (VFR) traffic. The deficiencies included the inadequacy of the see-and-avoid concept under the circumstances of this case; the technical limitations of radar in detecting all aircraft; {{and the absence of}} Federal Aviation Regulations which would provide a system of adequate separation of mixed <b>VFR</b> and <b>IFR</b> traffic in terminal areas.|$|R
5000|$|As of the 3rd of June 2010, all GAAP {{aerodromes}} {{were changed}} to Class D aerodromes, {{and the previous}} Class D procedures were changed. The new Class D procedures {{are similar to the}} FAA Class D procedures. VFR Aircraft are no longer required to enter the airspace via set inbound/outbound points, however can be directed there by ATC. <b>VFR</b> and <b>IFR</b> aircraft now require taxi clearance in the [...] "manoeuvring area" [...] of the aerodrome, but can still taxi within set apron areas without a clearance. IFR aircraft now receive slot times and the visibility requirements of Special VFR are reduced from 3000m Visibility to 1600m.|$|R

40|$|A {{report is}} {{presented}} to describe some of the errors that pilots make during flight under IFR. The data indicate that there is less risk during the approach and landing phase of IFR flights, as compared to <b>VFR</b> operations.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{publication}} {{is to increase the}} awareness of pilots in the use of GNSS. The Winter Training Brochure is oriented towards a brief and clear explanation of the basic principles and requirements for the correct and safe use of GNSS devices during the flight, with regard to the target group, pilots and instructors, different age, experience and skill categories. The Winter Training Brochure is divided into three main parts, Part 1 addresses the basic theoretical bases and GNSS principles common for <b>VFR</b> and <b>IFR</b> flights, Part 2 deals with the principles of GNSS use for VFR flights, Part 3 deals with the principles of GNSS use for IFR flights...|$|R
50|$|Indeed, Fierda disobeyed the rules. Shockingly, a {{technician}} from Husein Tower revealed that most pilots that {{fly in the}} route always did the same as Fierda, {{and said that they}} always do this until the accident because nothing ever happened to them. This time Fierda was unlucky, and in this situation she was all the one to blame, since it was not easy to change her way to fly. According to Frans Sumolang, Former Director of Merpati, when a plane follows a Visual Flight Rules, it should stay in Visual Flight Rules. Changing from <b>VFR</b> to <b>IFR</b> could screw the navigation calculation. Moreover, to change back to IFR, Flight 5601 needs to climb 3.300 ft first.|$|R
40|$|A brief {{outline of}} the chief areas where NASA is making efforts in {{aircraft}} noise research is given. This includes studies of the physical basis of aircraft noise and methods for accurately predicting it, the development of practical technologies for noise reduction, and the subjective response of people when exposed to aircraft noise. The JT 8 D Refan Program was to explore whether the noise reduction design concepts used effectively in modern high-bypass engines could also be applied practically and effectively as retrofittable modifications to existing older, low-bypass JT 8 D engines. A program has been completed on developing and demonstrating safe and acceptable flight procedures together with necessary airborne electronics to permit two-segment approaches under either <b>VFR</b> or <b>IFR</b> conditions...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{systems can}} place {{high levels of}} mental demand on human {{operators}} and methods of assessing these demands are needed. Subjective and performance metrics are typically employed while psychophysiological assessment {{has been used to}} a more limited extent. In this study, civilian pilots flew a single engine propeller aircraft on a flight profile designed to produce several levels of cognitive workload using <b>VFR</b> and <b>IFR</b> conditions. Subjective and brain wave (EEG) measures were used to assess mental workload. EEG theta band activity was sensitive to a wider range of workload levels and was more sensitive than the alpha and beta bands or the subjective reports. The alpha and beta bands reliably discriminated between ground and flight segments as did the subjective data...|$|R

5000|$|The Kamov Ka-50 is also {{fitted with}} an {{electronic}} radio and sighting-piloting-navigating system allowing flights at day and night in <b>VFR</b> and <b>IFR</b> weather conditions. The novelty of this avionics {{is based on the}} system of precise target designation with digital coded communication system, which ensures the exchange of information (precise enemy coordinates) between helicopters flying far apart from each other as well as with ground command posts. The Ka-52 is also equipped with a [...] "Phazotron" [...] cockpit radio-locator, allowing flights in adverse meteorological conditions and at night. The necessary information acquired by this radio-locator is transferred to the cockpit's multi-functional display screen. For conducting a fight, both pilots are equipped with range-finders built-in their helmets and they can use night vision eyepieces for night flights.|$|R
50|$|Class C {{airspace}} {{is defined}} below 8100 m and allows <b>IFR</b> and <b>VFR</b> operations. Both <b>IFR</b> and <b>VFR</b> operations {{are required to}} have permanent two-way radio contact with ATC. IFR flights are separated {{from each other and}} from VFR flights. VFR flights are separated from IFR flights and are provided traffic information about other VFR flights. Permission for using airspace is required except for the special cases listed in clause 114 of the Federal rules for using Russian air space.|$|R
50|$|How much traffic an aerodrome {{can have}} {{and still be}} an AFIS aerodrome is not internationally {{regulated}} and is subject to national regulation by the relevant CAA. The amount of traffic at AFIS aerodromes can vary depending subject to national requirements, {{as well as the}} type of traffic in the airspace. In some countries only VFR flights are allowed, but in many <b>IFR,</b> <b>VFR,</b> military and others are allowed. There are no international restrictions on what types of flight an AFIS aerodrome can service.|$|R
50|$|Airspace {{above the}} United States {{from the surface}} to 10,000 {{feet above sea level}} is limited to 250 knots (indicated airspeed) per the FAA's Federal Aviation Regulations. This speed limit hinders most modern-day {{tactical}} aircraft training operations, since low-level strikes are conducted almost exclusively at speeds exceeding 300 knots. Military Training Routes are usually limited to 420 knots, and in no case are aircraft allowed to exceed Mach 1 within United States sovereign airspace, except in designated Military Operation Areas. While on the route military aircraft squawk a Mode C Transponder code of '4000', which informs controllers that they are 'speeding' on a route. This squawk however is only legal by military aircraft, while inside a properly scheduled route corridor. MTRs do not constitute an official airspace, and are all open to <b>VFR</b> or <b>IFR</b> civilian traffic; however only military aircraft are allowed to squawk 4000 and exceed 250 knots.|$|R
50|$|It {{supports}} {{general aviation}} with no commercial airline service scheduled. The airport is equipped for <b>VFR</b> (visual) or <b>IFR</b> (instrument). Its control tower, equipped with radar, also provides {{air traffic control}} at low altitude in a large area of north-east to south-west of the Paris region. Both runways are still in use, the north-south 01/19 being reduced in length, and the east-west 10/28 extended for use by jet aircraft. Modern navigational aids are available and the facility is well maintained with a large airpark and {{a significant number of}} hangars.|$|R
40|$|General {{aviation}} and {{air taxi}} approach phase accidents, which occurred during <b>VFR</b> and <b>IFR,</b> respectively {{over the last}} 25 years, were analyzed. The data {{suggest that there is}} a 204 percent higher risk during the approach and landing phase of VFR flights, than during similar IFR operations (14. 82 vs 7. 27 accidents/ 100, 000 approaches). Alarmingly, the night single pilot IFR (SPIFR) accident rate is almost 8 times the rate of day IFR, 35. 43 vs 4. 47 accidents/ 100, 000 approaches, and {{two and a half times}} that of day VFR approaches, 35. 43 vs 14. 82 accidents/ 100, 000 approaches. Surprisingly, the overall SPIFR accident rates are not much higher than dual-pilot IFR (DPIFR), 7. 27 vs 6. 48 accidents/ 100, 000 approaches. The generally static ratio of the statistics for SPIFR/DPIFR accident rates may be accounted for by little or no change in general aviation cockpit technology during the last 25 years, and because IFR operational flight task management training has not kept pace...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a four phase effort to {{evaluate}} the application of hinged plate spoilers/dive brakes to a small general aviation aircraft are presented. The test vehicle was a single engine light aircraft modified with an experimental set of upper surface spoilers and lower surface dive brakes similar to the type used on sailplanes. The lift, drag, stick free stability, trim, and dynamic response characteristics of four different spoiler/dive brake configurations were determined. Tests also were conducted, under {{a wide range of}} flight conditions and with pilots of various experience levels, to determine the most favorable methods of spoiler control and to evaluate how spoilers might best be used during the approach and landing task. The effects of approach path angle, approach airspeed, and pilot technique using throttle/spoiler integrated control were investigated for day, night, <b>VFR,</b> and <b>IFR</b> approaches and landings. The test results indicated that spoilers offered significant improvements in the vehicle's performance and flying qualities for all elements of the approach and landing task, provided a suitable method of control was available...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{dangerous}} and usually illegal, {{a certain amount}} of VFR flying is conducted in IMC. A scenario is a VFR pilot taking off in VMC conditions, but encountering deteriorating visibility while en route. [...] "Continued VFR flight into IMC" [...] can lead to spatial disorientation of the pilot which is the cause of a significant number of general aviation crashes. VFR flight into IMC is distinct from [...] "VFR-on-top", an IFR procedure in which the aircraft operates in VMC using a hybrid of <b>VFR</b> and <b>IFR</b> rules, and [...] "VFR over the top", a VFR procedure in which the aircraft takes off and lands in VMC but flies above an intervening area of IMC. Also possible in many countries is [...] "Special VFR" [...] flight, where an aircraft is explicitly granted permission to operate VFR within the controlled airspace of an airport in conditions technically less than VMC; the pilot asserts they have the necessary visibility to fly despite the weather, must stay in contact with ATC, and cannot leave controlled airspace while still below VMC minimums.|$|R
5000|$|While the {{altitude}} limits of each route are not depicted on ordinary charts, the numbering system partially reveals this information. Routes are first designated as either <b>VFR</b> (VR) or <b>IFR</b> (IR) routes. Then, a numeric code identifies the individual route. A route with a 4-digit code contains no segment higher than 1,500 feet AGL, while a 3-digit code indicates {{that one or}} more segments of the route exist at altitudes higher than 1,500 feet AGL. [...] For example, the route VR1234 would indicate a VFR route exclusively below 1,500 feet AGL, while IR567 would indicate an IFR route {{with at least one}} segment higher than 1,500 feet AGL.|$|R
