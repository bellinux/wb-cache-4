40|$|Abstract— Automotive {{ergonomics}} is {{the study}} of how automotive can be designed better for human use. The human factor aspect of designing automobiles is first considered at the <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Packaging</b> stage. The term <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Packaging</b> comes to use whenever a new model is in the early stage of study. It is a method to safeguard and protect space for the human user and necessary components that make up the vehicle being designed. Other purposes are to provide alternative solutions and proposals, to ensure the legal requirements are met and to ensure all inhouse requirements are met. This study is to correlate automobiles interior dimensions to comfort factors by means of measuring and survey as well as using ergonomic software. Four cars are compared to achieve this objective. From the result, {{it can be seen that}} dimension factors of interior affects the car ergonomic factors. By looking into specific dimension parameters, one can see the differentiation between all four cars. For driver's comfort as well as reach factors, survey shows majority respondents prefer Honda City and Toyota Vios. However from discomfort assessment using Ramsis, it was suggested that both Proton cars gives better comfort for taller population while Honda City and Toyota Vios gives better comfort for shorter population. Other factors evaluated were driver clearance and spaciousness, driver seat and steering adjustability, driver reach ability to surrounding components, driver view (inside and outside), front and rear door entry / exit, rear passenger spaciousness and view, vibration and noise, and trunk space. ...|$|E

This thesis describes {{the design and}} analysis of control algorithms for a rotorcraft MAV using classical and dynamic inversion approaches. Classical control algorithms were developed based on linear, single input/single output analysis and were successfully implemented in hover, climb, and forward flight simulations. A dynamic inversion routine was then applied to the inner-loop control, providing improved inner-loop performance compared to the classical approach for nominal flight conditions. Finally, the two approaches were compared {{on the basis of}} their performance, disturbance rejection, and robustness.

40|$|Three {{new vehicle}} {{concepts}} {{in the field}} of transport are being developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) as part of the Next Generation Car META-project: Urban Modular Vehicle, Safe Light Regional Vehicle and Interurban Vehicle. In the submitted contribution, the focus lies on the development and application of a method for determining the vehicle concept and body in white construction for the Urban Modular Vehicle. With the electrification of cars, there is an opportunity to redesign the vehicle concepts and architectures of future vehicles. In the development of electric vehicles, the integration of new components (e. g. the volume and mass-intensive batteries), provide increasing demands on the overall vehicle design and <b>vehicle</b> <b>packaging.</b> By matching the arrangement and the integration of components for the Urban Modular Vehicle, a functionally integrated and modular body structure design is being developed. In the structural development phase, the methodological approach, which describes the complete development, employs various optimisations for the load path aligned design and modular structure design.

40|$|NASA has {{completed}} a preliminary mission and systems study of {{nuclear electric propulsion}} (NEP) systems for 'split-sprint' human exploration and related robotic cargo missions to Mars. This paper describes the study, the mission architecture selected, the NEP system and technology development needs, proposed development schedules, and estimated development costs. Since current administration policy makers have delayed funding for key technology development activities that could make Mars exploration missions a reality in the near future, NASA will have time to evaluate various alternate mission options, and it appears prudent to ensure that Mars mission plans focus on astronaut and mission safety, while reducing costs to acceptable levels. The split-sprint nuclear electric propulsion system offers trip times comparable to nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) systems, while providing mission abort opportunities that are not possible with 'reference' mission architectures. Thus, NEP systems offer short transit times for the astronauts, reducing the exposure of the crew to intergalactic cosmic radiation. The high specific impulse of the NEP system, which leads to very low propellant requirements, results in significantly lower 'initial mass in low earth orbit' (IMLEO). Launch <b>vehicle</b> <b>packaging</b> {{studies show that the}} NEP system can be launched, assembled, and deployed, with about one less 240 -metric-ton heavy lift launch vehicle (HLLV) per mission opportunity - a very Technology development cost of the nuclear reactor for an NEP system would be shared with the proposed nuclear surface power systems, since nuclear systems will be required to provide substantial electrical power on the surface of Mars.

System upgrades are expected to evolve that will result in even shorter trip times, improved payload capabilities, and enhanced safety and reliability...|$|E
40|$|The Orion capsule is {{designed}} both for Low Earth Orbit missions to the ISS and for missions to the moon. For ISS class missions, the capsule will use an Apollo-style direct entry. For lunar return missions, {{depending on the}} timing of the mission, the capsule could perform a direct entry or a skip entry of up to 4800 n. mi. in order to land in the coastal waters of California. The physics of atmospheric re-entry determine the capability of the Orion vehicle. For a given vehicle mass and shape, physics tells us that the driving parameters for an entry vehicle are the hypersonic lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) and the flight path angle at entry interface (gamma(sub EI)). The design of the Orion atmospheric re-entry must meet constraints during both nominal and dispersed flight conditions on landing accuracy, heating rate, total heat load, sensed acceleration, and proper disposal of the Service Module. These constraints define an entry corridor in the space of L/D-gamma(sub EI); if the vehicle falls within this corridor, then all constraints are met. The gamma(sub EI) dimension of the corridor can be further constrained by the gloads experienced during emergency entries. Thus, the entry performance for the Orion vehicle can be described completely by the L/D. Bounds on the hypersonic L/D necessary to achieve all the mission requirements can be defined for the given entry corridor. Landing accuracy performance drives the lower limit on L/D. In order to achieve the desired landing accuracy, a minimum L/D must be ensured. The design of the Thermal Protection System (TPS) drives the upper limit on L/D. A higher L/D can drive mass into the design of the TPS. Conversely, once the TPS {{is designed}}, the L/D must be ensured to stay below a certain limit in order for the TPS to stay within its design envelop. The L/D must stay within its upper and lower bounds during dispersed flight conditions. L/D is a function of both the aerodynamics and the center-of-gravity (CG) of the vehicle. The aerodynamics of the vehicle are determined by Computational Fluid Mechanics (CFD) and wind tunnel tests. However, the aerodynamics are not known precisely. Instead, an aerodynamic database has been developed where the aerodynamic coefficients are known to fall within a probabilistic band defined by upper and lower bounds. It is expected that the probabilistic band will shrink after the first missions are flown and real-world data is collected. Until that time, the Orion must be designed to the current aerodynamic database. Thus, for a given aerodynamic database with given uncertainties, the allowable range in L/D can be mapped to an allowable box for the CG location. The CG box is used to set requirements on the dispersions allowed for <b>vehicle</b> <b>packaging</b> and cargo storage. As the aerodynamic uncertainties decrease, the size of the CG box can increase. This paper discusses the technique used to map the minimum and maximum L/D bounds set by the entry performance requirements to the allowable dispersions in CG while accounting for aerodynamic uncertainties. The L/D is defined as the ratio of the lift force to the drag force. It is equivalent to the ratio of lift coefficient (C(sub L)) over drag coefficient (C(sub D)). C(sub L) and C(sub D) are functions of Mach number (M) and angle of attack (alpha). A Mach number of 25 is used as a measuring point of the hypersonic L/D. Variations in C(sub L), C(sub D) and alpha cause variations in L/D. Equation (1) shows the three contributions to the variation in L/D...|$|E
