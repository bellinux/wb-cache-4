40|$|Limited {{work has}} been {{reported}} on determining the thermo-mechanical stresses in a multilayered composite pressure vessel when the influence of its closed ends is considered. In this study, an analytical solution was derived for determining the stress distribution of a multilayered composite pressure vessel subjected to an internal fluid pressure and a thermal load, based on thermo-elasticity theory. In the solution, a pseudo extrusion pressure was proposed to emulate {{the effect of the}} closed ends of the pressure vessel. To validate the analytical solution, the stress distribution of the pressure vessel was also computed using finite element (FE) method. It was found that the analytical results were in good agreement with the computational ones, and the effect of thermal load on the stress distribution was discussed in detail. The proposed analytical solution provides an exact means to design multilayered composite pressure <b>vessels.</b> <b>Department</b> of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Diabetic {{retinopathy}} (DR) is {{a common}} complication of diabetes that damages the retina and leads to sight loss if treated late. In its earliest stage DR can be diagnosed {{by the presence of}} a microaneurysm (MA). Although some algorithms have been developed thus far, the accurate detection of MA in a color retinal image is still a challenging problem. By locating a blood vessels' width, color, reflectivity, tortuosity, and abnormal branching, one can deduce the existence of DR. In this paper we propose new methods to detect MA based on Dictionary Learning (DL) with Sparse Representation Classifier (SRC), and extract retinal blood vessels using SRC. For MA detection we first locate all possible MA candidates with Multi-scale Gaussian Correlation Filtering (MSCF), and then classify these candidates with Dictionary Learning (DL) via SRC. Particularly, two dictionaries one for the MA and one for the non-MA are learned from example MA and non-MA structures, and are used in the SRC process. Experimental results on the ROC database show that the proposed method can well distinguish MA from non-MA objects. Vessel extraction is based on Multi-scale Production of Matched Filter (MPMF) and SRC. First, we locate vessel center-line candidates using Multi-scale Matched Filtering, scale production, double thresholding and center-line detection. Then, the candidates which are center-line pixels are classified using SRC. Two dictionary elements of vessel and non-vessel are used in the SRC process. Experimental results on two public databases show that the proposed method is good at distinguishing vessel from non-vessel objects, and is even able to extract the center-line of small <b>vessels.</b> <b>Department</b> of Computin...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the years}} The Institute of Marine Research, has been {{developed}} to become the leading body for monitoring and exploration of marine ecosystems, development of the aquaculture industry, and science based advices on harvesting of living marine resources in Norway. The institute developed with a steadily growing classical hierarchical organization with departments according to scientific disciplines or ecosystem categories. During the nineties the institute operated with scientific centres on aquaculture, living resources, and marine environment, and received a rather favourable evaluation by an international panel in 2001. Instead of continuing on a recognized way of functioning, a process was started to develop {{the organization of the}} institute to be better able to deliver science based advices according to the ecosystem approach. A matrix organization with four research and advisory programmes, 19 research groups, a research technical department with eight sub-units, a central administration and a research <b>vessel</b> <b>department</b> was implemented in 2004. Recently, the organizations is adjusted and developed even further so that we now have 10 programs, five of them a research and advisory profile, the others a clear thematic profile. The research and technical groups have been integrated to get a better cooperation and social interaction between the scientific and technical employees. We analyse how these structural changes have influenced the scientific production, the advisory activity, the “working environment” and the well being of the employees of the institute...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS) and extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) {{have been}} indicated as treatment for acute respiratory and/or cardiac failure. Here we describe our first year experience of in-hospital ECLS activity, the operative algorithm and the protocol for centralization of adult patients from district hospitals. Methods At a tertiary referral trauma center (Careggi Teaching Hospital, Florence, Italy), an ECLS program was developed from 2008 by the Emergency Department and Heart and <b>Vessel</b> <b>Department</b> ICUs. The ECLS team {{consists of an}} intensivist, a cardiac surgeon, a cardiologist and a perfusionist, all trained in ECLS technique. ECMO support was applied in case of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) not responsive to conventional treatments. The use of veno-arterial (V-A) ECLS for cardiac support was reserved for cases of cardiac shock refractory to standard treatment and cardiac arrests not responding to conventional resuscitation. Results A total of 21 patients were treated with ECLS {{during the first year}} of activity. Among them, 13 received ECMO for ARDS (5 H 1 N 1 -virus related), with a 62 % survival. In one case of post-traumatic ARDS, V-A ECLS support permitted multiple organ donation after cerebral death was confirmed. Patients treated with V-A ECLS due to cardiogenic shock (N = 4) had a survival rate of 50 %. No patients on V-A ECLS support after cardiac arrest survived (N = 4). Conclusions In our centre, an ECLS Service was instituted over a relatively limited period of time. A strict collaboration between different specialists can be regarded as a key feature to efficiently implement the process. </p...|$|R

40|$|The early {{diagnosis}} of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), a common complication of diabetes that damages the retina, {{is crucial to}} the protection of the vision of diabetes sufferers. The onset of PDR is signaled by the appearance of neovascular net. Such neovascular nets might be identified using retinal vessel extraction techniques. The commonly used matched filter methods often produce false positive detections of neovascular nets due to their proneness to detect nonline edges as well as lines. In this paper, we propose a modified matched filter for retinal vessel extraction that applies a local vessel cross-section analysis using double-sided thresholding to reduce false responses to nonline edges. Our proposed modified matched filters demonstrated higher true positive rate and lesser false detection than existing matched-filter-based schemes in <b>vessel</b> extraction. <b>Department</b> of Computin...|$|R
