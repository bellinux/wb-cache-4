40|$|This paper {{describes}} the front-end of a fully integrated analog interface for 300 MSps, high-definition <b>video</b> <b>digitizers</b> {{in a system}} on-chip environment. The analog interface is implemented in a 1. 2 V, 65 -nm digital CMOS process and the design minimizes the number of power domains using core transistors only. Each analog video receiver channel contains an integrated multiplexer with a current-mode dc-clamp, a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) and a pseudo second-order RC low-pass filter. The digital charge-pump clamp is integrated with low-voltage bootstrapped tee-switches inside the multiplexer, while restoring the dc component of ac-coupled inputs. The PGA contains a four-stage fully symmetric pseudo-differential amplifier with common-mode feedforward and inherent common-mode feedback, utilized in a closed loop capacitive feedback configuration. The amplifier features offset cancellation during the horizontal blanking. The video interface is evaluated using a unique test signal over a range of video formats for INL+/DNL+, INL-/DNL-. The 0. 07 - 0. 39 mV INL, 2 - 70 μV DNL, and 66 - 74 dB of SFDR, enable us to target various formats for 9 - 12 bit Low-voltage digitizers. ...|$|R

40|$|Retardations were {{measured}} along the lengths of single chromosomal spindle fibres, from metaphase through anaphase, from video-taped images of crane-fly spermatocytes incubated at various temperatures (4 — 30 °C).

40|$|Due to the {{progress}} in computers and sensors development {{the number of}} virtual reality application (VR) grows significantly. Different sensors and techniques such as laser range finders, still and <b>video</b> cameras, mechanical <b>digitizers</b> are used to obtain spatial object coordinates for producing 3 D models. The two main requirements to the produced model are the accurate geometry reconstruction and the realistic texture generation. The means of digital close-range photogrammetry are quite enough to satisfy those requirements. The same images {{can be used as}} for accurate 3 D-geometry reconstruction as for adequate photometry modeling- generation of realistic object texture. The close-range photogrammetry technique for accurate geometric and texturing modeling is well-developed for 2. 5 D (depth) object models. But for complex 3 D objects that have no single valued plane projection there are some problems with surface reconstruction and texture generation. In this case uniform surface can not be reconstructed by traditionally used Delaunay triangulation procedure for all points of objects. So the orthophoto can not be generated because of surface singularity. The paper considers the approaches for these problems solution. It describes the method for reconstruction of the uniform surface for some classes of complex 3 D objects represented in form of object space coordinates cloud. Also the method for accurate texture generation from a set of object images obtained from various viewpoints is presented. The results of object reconstruction and texturing are given along with the description of developed close-range photogrammetric system. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{gravitropism}} is hindered {{by the fact}} that as a root responds, the gravitational stimulus changes. Using a feedback system to connect a rotating stage platform to a <b>video</b> <b>digitizer</b> system, we were able to maintain a constant angle of gravistimulation to Arabidopsis roots for long time periods. The rate of curvature approximated the sine rule for angles of stimulation between 20 ° and 120 °. For a given angle of stimulation, the rate of curvature also remained constant, with no observed diminishment of the response. Although previous reports of Arabidopsis root gravitropism suggest latent periods of approximately 30 min, using a smooth mechanical stage to reorient the root, we observed a mean time lag of approximately 10 min. This more rapid onset of curvature can, in part, be explained by reduced mechanical perturbation during the process of gravistimulation. This suggests that mechanical stimulation associated with rapid root re-orientation may confound investigations of early gravitropic events...|$|E

First, we have designed a simple, fast and accurate calibration procedure which does not require any knowledge about the camera parameters or the relative position of the camera with the laser plane. Furthermore, this calibration procedure is performed only once, authorizing stable and accurate results. The result of the scanning of a given object is given in cylindrical coordinates, that is the range image R(0, h) where 0 is the angle of rotation of the rotary table and h the height along its axis of rotation.
