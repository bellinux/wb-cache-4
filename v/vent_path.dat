A series of spoiler cross sectioned shapes were tested utilizing a reflection-plane model. Five-component force characteristics and hinge moment measurements were obtained. Results confirm earlier two-dimensional tests which showed that spoilers could provide large lift increments at any flap setting, and that spoiler control reversal tendencies could be eliminated by providing a <b>vent</b> <b>path</b> from lower surface to upper surface.

Tests of several spoiler configurations show adequate control effectiveness with flap nested. It is found that providing a <b>vent</b> <b>path</b> allowing lower surface air to escape to the upper surface as the spoiler opens alleviates control reversal and hysteresis tendencies. Spoiler cross-sectional shape variations generally have a modest influence on control characteristics.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this test was to {{characterize}} the conductance of different configurations of <b>vent</b> <b>paths</b> put into weapons assemblies through application of Halthane 88 - 3 precoats onto the parts. Conductance {{is a measure of}} the ease of gas flow in an assembly. It is the inverse of resistance which may be more familiar to most readers. It is defined as the resultant of the gas flow (torr- 1 /sec) divided by the pressure drop (torr) in the assembly. Its dimensions are thus liters per second. The conductance paths are put into the precoats to allow pumpdown of weapon assemblies and communication during stockpile life. They are put into the precoats by applying tape of the desired width onto the part prior to coating. The Halthane 88 - 3 is then rolled onto the part and when the tape is removed the <b>vent</b> <b>paths</b> are left. To keep this report unclassified some of the description of the situation has been abbreviated. For a more complete description of the device configuration and conductance issue, see the final report on WDW 9009 -A and -B (CODT 98 - 0809) ...|$|R
50|$|An {{interior}} vapor retarder {{is useful}} in heating-dominated climates while an exterior vapor retarder {{is useful in}} cooling-dominated climates. In most climates it is often better to have a vapor-open building assembly, meaning that walls and roofs should be designed to dry: either to the inside, the outside, or both, so the ventilation of water vapor {{should be taken into}} consideration.A vapor barrier on the warm side of the envelope must be combined with a <b>venting</b> <b>path</b> on the cold side of the insulation. This is because no vapor barrier is perfect, and because water may get into the structure, typically from rain. In general, the better the vapor barrier and the drier the conditions, the less venting is required.|$|R
50|$|Historically {{from time}} to time, {{underground}} seams of coal have caught fire, often from careless or unfortunate mining activities. The pocket of ignited coal is fed oxygen by <b>vent</b> <b>paths</b> {{that have not yet}} been discovered. These can smolder for years. Commonly, exhaust vents in populated areas are soon sensed and are sealed while vents in uninhabited areas remain undiscovered. Occasionally, vents are discovered via fumes sensed by passers-by, often in forested areas. Attempts to extinguish those remaining have at times been futile, and several such combustion areas exist today. The existence of an underground combustion site can sometimes be identified in the winter where fallen snow is seen to be melted by the warmth conducted from below. Proposals for harnessing this heat as geothermal energy have not been successful.|$|R
40|$|Waste {{in large}} waste boxes can {{generate}} {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) and hydrogen. These waste boxes {{may or may not}} have flow paths out of them (although it is believed that most do). These boxes will be retrieved, sampled, and then coated with polyurea. After coating, filters will be installed in the box to keep the concentration of VOCs and hydrogen acceptably low. The MDSA requires that a <b>vent</b> <b>path</b> must be protected during application of the polyurea coating. If the box has been sampled then it is vented and the <b>vent</b> <b>path</b> must be protected. This report provides a model in which the user inputs the free volume of the waste box, sample concentration (ppm of total VOC or volume fraction hydrogen) along with the number of filters to be placed into the waste box lid. Using this information, the model provides an estimate of concentration vs. time or the number of filters needed to reduce the concentration by a specified fraction. If the equations from this report are placed into spreadsheets which are then used to demonstrate TSR compliance, the spreadsheets must come under the Software QA Plan for such documents. Chapters 2 and 3 present the theory. Chapter 4 presents the method with examples of its use found in Chapter 5.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the models employed and analyses performed {{to estimate the}} source terms which would result from deflagrations in waste storage and processing tanks at the Savannah River Site (SRS). It {{should be noted that}} SRS waste tank deflagrations are very low probability events. The three main source generation mechanisms associated with waste tank deflagrations are: (1) entrainment from the liquid surface, (2) vaporization from the liquid surface, and (3) solids fire ignited {{as a result of the}} deflagration. The results of this work show that entrainment would be the dominant source term generation mode for cases where the liquid waste solution level is near the <b>vent</b> <b>path.</b> Vaporization would be the dominant mode for cases where the liquid level is lower. The maximum vaporization source term is approximately an order of magnitude less than that maximum entrainment source term. The source term associated with a solids fire would be insignificant in comparison...|$|E

The study covered conditions wherein the instruments weren't covered, covers were used with <b>vent</b> <b>paths</b> of varying sizes, and if the instruments were sealed and a nitrogen purge was employed. The contamination limits {{for each of the}} Galileo instruments are considered. Analytic approximations are devised for the diffusion of particles from surfaces and materials in the Shuttle bay during the ascent phase, using Fick's second law of diffusion. It is recommended that an instrument purge be implemented during the first 15 min of Shuttle flight in order to carry the contaminants from both the bay fixtures and from the instruments into space. Covers are suggested as necessary for the most sensitive instruments...|$|R

This is usually done by applying a shortest path search algorithm on a non-convex ear impression. For the functionality of this so-called <b>vent</b> the <b>path</b> search algorithm has to fulfill several constraints like smoothness and space consumption of the vent. The proposed solution is based upon {{a modified version of}} Dijkstra’s algorithm to address the constraints and to increase accuracy.

40|$|For this scenario, {{hydrogen}} is generated {{in a container}} that is eventually stored within a drum or some type of long range storage container. When preparing for long-term storage, the hydrogen container (HC) is placed {{in a plastic bag}} (PB 1). The PB 1 is then placed inside an inner drum (ID). The ID is placed inside a plastic bag (PB 2) which is then placed within an outer drum (OD). One or more ODs are then storage is a large container (LC). Filtered vents or vent holes are located on all the container barriers to prevent pressurization and allow gases to flow {{in and out of the}} HC. The LC is vented to the atmosphere with four <b>vent</b> <b>paths</b> for this example. The source of hydrogen generation for this study is not important. Any source that generates hydrogen in elemental form (i. e., H{sub 2 }) is a candidate for the purposes of this generic evaluation. The released hydrogen accumulates inside the waste packaging. Depending on the permeability of the packaging layers, some of the accumulated hydrogen may diffuse out of the packaging layers and into the space surrounding the drums. Since the drums are confined in the LC, the hydrogen accumulates in the LC as it did inside the drums if venting of the LC does not occur. If accumulation in the LC is allowed without venting, the confinement is eventually breached or the {{hydrogen is}} consumed by reaction with other chemical species. One possible reaction is combustion with oxygen. Such a reaction can be explosive, and from this possibility arises the safety concern...|$|R
40|$|Composite materials, used on many instruments, are a {{potential}} contamination source for sensitive sensors, especially for sensors or detectors cooled below - 80 C. It {{is a well}} known fact that composite materials absorb water during fabrication, integration, test, and launch activities and desorb this water under vacuum conditions. Water absorption {{can be divided into}} two types: shallow water and deep water. Shallow water is generally about 500 A thick on a clean material surface and is easily desorbed under vacuum conditions. Deep water {{is a function of the}} material and is absorbed into the bulk of the material. Deep water can outgas for weeks, months, or years, depending on the <b>vent</b> <b>path,</b> the amount of absorbed water, and the temperature of the material. Several operational strategies have been successfully employed on the Wide Field Planetary Camera. The operational strategies include ultradry gaseous nitrogen purge, dew point of less than - 80 C, and vacuum bake-out with verification of outgassing rates. The nitrogen purge is instituted during the fabrication phase and is continued through launch activities. Great care is taken to avoid extended periods of time that the material is exposed to the ambient environment (50 percent relative humidity). On-orbit operational strategies include heat-up and cool-down scenarios which allow the deep water to be sufficiently outgassed before cooling the sensors or detectors...|$|E
40|$|Analysis {{has been}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} utilization of fuel assembly venting in the reference design of the gas-cooled fast reactor under study {{as part of the}} larger research effort at MIT under Gen-IV NERI Project No. 05 - 044, "Optimized Competitive Supercritical-CO₂ Cycle GFR for Gen-IV Service. " The focus of this work is on selection and optimization of a fuel assembly configuration best suited for venting, assessment of the radionuclide release of such an assembly design, and identification of plant systems which must be altered in order to support fuel venting. The innovative tube-in-duct design of the reference GFR fuel assembly is particularly well suited to venting, allowing fission products to diffuse into a common header before being routed along a <b>vent</b> <b>path</b> and eventually being released to the primary coolant system. A set of equations were developed which model the transport of fission products from fuel to <b>vent</b> <b>path</b> to primary coolant inventory and then into the containment atmosphere, with emphasis on conservatism in calculations of coolant impurity levels. Using these equations in a computer code, the lengthy list of radioactive and chemically volatile fission products for study was reduced to only fifteen species of any great concern. Of these, 85 Kr and 137 Cs were considered conservative bounding cases on the behavior of the other nuclides. The chemistry of the fission products released to the coolant was explored. In particular, reactions between fission products and their surroundings were identified, and estimates of deposition of both compounds and free atoms on steel surfaces were made. Investigation of reactions between fission products and CO₂ revealed that the formation of stable oxides would lead to deposition of most volatile species within the fuel assembly's debris trap. (cont.) The radioactive volatiles which remain in the primary comprise only tritium, two isotopes of iodine, two isotopes of tellurium, and three isotopes of cesium. These species deposit on primary surfaces to a great enough degree to preclude hands-on primary system maintenance. In addition, techniques for removal of volatile and radioactive species from the primary coolant were identified, and a scheme for purification of the primary coolant volume was selected. The analysis confirms that primary coolant activity can be maintained at acceptable levels when purification of the primary coolant volume occurs once per hour. The response of the vent system to changes in primary system pressure was also investigated. In particular, the small periodic pressure transients known as breathing were studied, as were loss-of-coolant type scenarios. Both cases were investigated using hand calculations and computational techniques, and the radiological consequences of each were addressed. The analysis demonstrated the ability of the vented fuel assembly to quickly equalize pressure {{in the event of a}} sudden drop in operating pressure, and also showed the ability of a succession of plena to prevent the expulsion of much of the activity inventory of the plena during a breathing transient. Conversely, the use of a single plenum results in reduced activity release during a LOCA. After consideration of both results, a two-plenum approach, with a large lower annular plenum following a small upper axial plenum, was selected as the final design. by Stephanie A. McKee. Thesis (S.

40|$|A {{rocket engine}} igniter {{has been created}} that uses a {{pneumatically}} driven hammer that, by specialized geometry, is induced into an oscillatory state {{that can be used}} to either repeatedly impact a piezoelectric crystal with sufficient force to generate a spark capable of initiating combustion, or can be used with any other system capable of generating a spark from direct oscillatory motion. This innovation uses the energy of flowing gaseous propellant, which by means of pressure differentials and kinetic motion, causes a hammer object to oscillate. The concept works by mass flows being induced through orifices on both sides of a cylindrical tube with one or more vent paths. As the mass flow enters the chamber, the pressure differential is caused because the hammer object is supplied with flow on one side and the other side is opened with access to the <b>vent</b> <b>path.</b> The object then crosses the vent opening and begins to slow because the pressure differential across the ball reverses due to the geometry in the tube. Eventually, the object stops because of the increasing pressure differential on the object until all of the kinetic energy has been transferred to the gas via compression. This is the point where the object reverses direction because of the pressure differential. This behavior excites a piezoelectric crystal via direct impact from the hammer object. The hammer strikes a piezoelectric crystal, then reverses direction, and the resultant high voltage created from the crystal is transferred via an electrode to a spark gap in the ignition zone, thereby providing a spark to ignite the engine. Magnets, or other retention methods, might be employed to favorably position the hammer object prior to start, but are not necessary to maintain the oscillatory behavior. Various manifestations of the igniter have been developed and tested to improve device efficiency, and some improved designs are capable of operation at gas flow rates of a fraction of a gram per second (0. 001 lb/s) and pressure drops on the order of 30 to 50 kilopascal (a few psi). An analytical model has been created and tested in conjunction with a precisely calibrated reference model. The analytical model accurately captures the overall behavior of this innovation. The model is a simple "volume-orifice" concept, with each chamber considered a single temperature and pressure "node" connected to adjacent nodes, or to vent paths through flow control orifices. Mass and energy balances are applied to each node, with gas flow predicted using simple compressible flow equations...|$|E
40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{documents the}} calculations done {{to determine the}} relief capacity of the solenoid vacuum pumping line. The calculations were done by David Bell, a co-op student from the University of Wisconsin. The calculations are attached. The conclusion is that the vacuum pumping line has a venting capacity of 129 g/s warm helium or 298 g/s warm nitrogen. Both of these capacities are {{much larger than the}} expected operating mass flow rates of the liquid helium (5 to 15 g/s) or liquid nitrogen (2 or 3 g/s) circuits. The calculations assume the solenoid vacuum vessel is at 3 psig and the relief plate is set at 1. 5 psig. Additional calculations were done to prove that the venting capacity of the vacuum pumping line exceeded flowrates due to a failure mode. These calculations are attached. Since the system is not finalized, (pipe sizes not determined, components sized [...] .) the calculations were done by first picking reasonable line sizes based on known allowed pressure drops in the system and then doing a maximum delivery rate calculation if a line was completely severed in the vacuum space of the solenoid/control dewar. The numbers from these calculations say that failure mode flow rates are 80 g/s liquid helium or 80 g/s liquid nitrogen. Both these values are less than the capacity of the relief line. In the five months since the (12 / 92 Dave Bell) calculations were done, some changes occured to the relief path. The most notable is that the radiation shield is now considered to be 6. 625 -inch O. D. instead of 6. 00 -inch used in the venting calculation. This change would tend to lower the capacity numbers. Another change was that for about half the <b>venting</b> <b>path</b> the chimney vacuum shell size was increased to 10 -inch pipe. This change tends to increase the capacity numbers which were done assuming 8 -inch pipe. These changes taken together probably offset each other or make the capacity numbers better. In either case, since the margin of safety is large, the calculations have not been redone...|$|R

40|$|Remote drum venting was {{performed}} on a population of unvented high activity drums (HAD) {{in the range of}} 63 to 435 plutonium equivalent Curies (PEC). These 55 -gallon Transuranic (TRU) drums will eventually be shipped to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). As a part of this process, the development of a calculational model was required to predict the transient hydrogen concentration response of the head space and polyethylene liner (if present) within the 55 -gallon drum. The drum and liner were vented using a Remote Drum Venting System (RDVS) that provided a <b>vent</b> sampling <b>path</b> for measuring flammable hydrogen vapor concentrations and allow hydrogen to diffuse below lower flammability limit (LFL) concentrations. One key application of the model was to determine the transient behavior of hydrogen in the head space, within the liner, and the sensitivity to the number of holes made in the liner or number of filters. First-order differential mass transport equations were solved using Laplace transformations and numerically to verify the results. the Mathematica 6. 0 computing tool was also used as a validation tool and for examining larger than two chamber systems.
