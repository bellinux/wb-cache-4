Rebadged models have been offered for sale claiming to {{have dealt with the}} power supply issues.Unless you have a 240v version which is available by special order, then It’s wise to use a Variac (variable transformer) to drop the power to the required 220v for the UK, as some of the UK still receives 240V at the socket not the 230v it should.With <b>valve</b> <b>equipment</b> a 20 volt overload on the Mains input will result in about a 40 volt overload on the HT (High Tension) side. Use of correct input voltage is important. If in any doubt as to the voltage of your Yaqin, remove the cover from the power transformer, Yaqin typically stamps the primary voltage on the top.|$|E

Because emission amount is based on input air amount, so how to control the input air amount {{is the basis of}} the whole system. On the basis of traditional inlet manifold MVEM, we have considered the affection of PCV system, and we have simulated the actual input air process by getting improved module’s input air amount and inlet manifold pressure parameters. So the fuel-air ratio precision can be increased greatly. We also have prompted some improving directions about traditional inlet manifold.

40|$|The {{converter}} valve is {{the core}} equipment in the HVDC power transmission system, a+-nd its performance has a direct effect on the reliability, stability and efficiency of the whole power system. As the basic unit of HVDC converter valve, the thyristor level needs to be test routinely in order to grasp {{the state of the}} converter <b>valve</b> <b>equipment.</b> Therefore, it is urgent to develop a novel synthetic test system for the thyristor level with thyristor control unit (TCU). However, currently there is no specific test scheme for the thyristor level of HVDC converter valve. In this paper, the synthetic test principle, content and methods for the thyristor level with TCU are presented based on the analysis of the thyristor reverse recovery characteristic and the IEC technology standard. And a transient high-voltage pulse is applied to the thyristor level during its reverse recovery period in order to test the characteristics of thyristor level. Then, the synthetic test system for the thyristor level is applied to the converter valve test of ± 800 kV HVDC power transmission project, and the practical test result verifies the reasonability and validity of the proposed synthetic test system...|$|E

30|$|In 1999, Gruenhagen {{invented the}} use of mud as a medium that {{will be sent to}} the {{underground}} command, to complete the pressure pulse modulation in the ground, the pressure pulse in the underground by the pressure or flow sensor sensitive, by the microprocessor decoding and the command sent to the controller [3]. During drilling, a constant flow rate of mud is pumped from the mud pool with a main pump. Most of the mud into the mine, to maintain the mud circulation, bypass <b>valve</b> <b>equipment</b> controlled by the electronic controller. When the valve was opened and closed, a flow pulse was generated. The amplitude and time of such a pulse could be controlled. The speed of these pulses can be detected by suitable underground equipment, such as flow meters, pressure gauges, and turbines. Data transmission is based on binary modulation pulse. In 2005, Halliburton, as the representative of the downlink channel remote transmission system invented by Finke et al., provides improved equipment and method for remote command transmission. By the pressure pulse from the ground equipment, it sent instructions to the bottom hole assembly [4]. The utility model is composed of a ground transmitter which generates a pressure pulse signal, a control system, and an underground receiver which is used for receiving and decoding the pulse signal. When the bypass valve was opened and closed at work, a series of pressure pulse signals which could be received and decoded by the underground receiver could be generated. This method reduced the time spent in the downlink channel transmission without interrupting the drilling. If the upward and downward channel signals were transmitted at different frequencies, the bidirectional transmission could be realized. The remote transmission scheme and software program provided an innovative method for the filtering and decoding of downlink channel signals. The software program determined the time interval between the peak values of the pulse and decoded them into commands. The software program also included an error check that was completely received. The utility model was characterized in that the utility model related to a pressure pulse which was generated by the ground equipment to transmit the instruction to the down hole drill assembly without interrupting the drilling. The pressure pulse signal was detected using a down hole receiver, and the pressure pulse signal was decoded by a software program. It could also achieve a two-way communication between the ground equipment and the bottom hole assembly at a relatively fast transfer rate; so, this method was particularly practical.|$|E
