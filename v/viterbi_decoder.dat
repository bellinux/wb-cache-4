Usually, additional interleaving (on {{top of the}} time and frequency interleaving mentioned above) in between the two layers of coding is implemented. The choice for Reed-Solomon coding as the outer error correction code is based on the observation that the <b>Viterbi</b> <b>decoder</b> used for inner convolutional decoding produces short error bursts when there is a high concentration of errors, and Reed-Solomon codes are inherently well-suited to correcting bursts of errors.|$|E

Results show that,behaviors of SVAD-NTC performance increase as you increase the NTCs, but beyond 6 NTCs there is no significant change and SVAD-NTCs design drastically reduce the total residual error from 216, 878 of Reed Solomon to 23, 900...|$|R

First, {{we focus on}} ST code constructions for the short block-length case, i. e., when the block-length is equal to or {{slightly}} larger {{than the number of}} transmit antennas. We present constructions based on dense lattice packings and nested lattice (Voronoi) shaping. Our codes achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of quasi-static MIMO fading channels for any fading statistics, and perform very well also at practical, moderate values of signal to noise ratios (SNR). Then, we extend the construction to the case of large block lengths, by using trellis coset coding. We provide constructions of trellis coded modulation (TCM) schemes that are endowed with good packing and shaping properties. Both short-block and trellis constructions allow for a reduced complexity decoding algorithm based on minimum mean squared error generalized decision feedback equalizer (MMSE-GDFE) lattice decoding and a combination of this with a <b>Viterbi</b> TCM <b>decoder</b> for the TCM case.

Sphere decoder (SD) using depth-first tree searching and K-best algorithm are used for near optimum detector.

In this paper, we propose a suboptimal MIMO detector employing Viterbi algorithm instead of tree searching. This detector can keep the computational throughput constant and reduce the complexity because the sorting is not required. In the simulation, we analyze the advantage and the drawback of the proposed detector in the environment of IEEE 802. 11 n system.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 19 - 21, 1979 / Town and Country Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaThe use of {{convolutional}} codes with {{feedback decoding}} {{is the most}} common error-correction technique in simple communication systems. A drawback of conventional feedback decoding is the limitation to a class of self-orthogonal codes which, in general, are non-optimum. Based on distance properties of the utilized code and test-error pattern analysis, we propose generalized feedback decoding that does not have the above mentioned limitation. This is minimum distance decoding and can be applied to any convolutional code while still maintaining its simplicity. Therefore, it has the advantage of being easily adopted in the existing systems. We can use complicated <b>Viterbi</b> or sequential <b>decoder</b> in large terminals and, with the same code, use the proposed decoder in small terminals; otherwise, both large and small terminals must utilize the same type decoder.

We first analyze the ICI in frequency domain with a reduced set of parameters, and following this analysis, we derive an EM algorithm for maximum likelihood (ML) data detection. An ML-EM receiver for OFDM systems and a TURBO-EM receiver for BICM/OFDM systems are then developed to reduce computational complexity of the EM algorithm and to exploit temporal diversity, the main idea {{of which is to}} integrate the pro-posed EM algorithm with a groupwise ICI cancellation method. Compared with the ML-EM receiver, the TURBO-EM receiver further employs a soft-output <b>Viterbi</b> algorithm (SOVA) <b>decoder</b> to exchange information with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) EM detector through the turbo principle.

30|$|Owning to {{the high}} peak-to-average power ratio problem, the power {{efficiency}} of orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) systems is usually low. It deteriorates in millimeter wave systems in which the design of an efficient linear power amplifier is much more challenging. The linear-amplification-with-nonlinear-component (LINC) technique {{can serve as a}} remedy, decomposing the input signal into two constant-envelop component signals followed by high-efficient nonlinear amplifiers. However, the power combiner, a key component used to combine the amplified signals, is difficult to implement. Combinerless LINC systems employ two transmit antennas such that two component signals can be naturally combined at the receiver. Unfortunately, the performance of combinerless LINC-OFDM systems is seriously degraded if difference, even small, exists between the two channels. The maximum likelihood (ML) receiver can effectively solve the problem; however, its computational complexity is prohibitedly high. We propose a coded combinerless LINC-OFDM system, including a convolutional encoder and a list <b>Viterbi</b> algorithm (LVA) <b>decoder,</b> to solve the problem. The LVA can provide a small number of candidates for the ML detector, dramatically reducing the required computational complexity. We also utilize an enhanced zero-forcing equalizer such that the soft-demapping operation can be effectively conducted. Finally, we propose a simple iterative interference cancellation scheme to further enhance the performance. Simulations show that the proposed combinerless LINC-OFDM system can outperform the conventional OFDM while the consumed power is much lower.|$|R
