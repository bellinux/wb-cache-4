40|$|Abstract Introduction Vertical gaze palsy is a {{recognized}} manifestation of midbrain lesions. It rarely {{is a consequence}} of unilateral thalamic infarction. Case presentation We report the case of a 48 -year-old African-American woman who presented to our facility with vertical gaze palsy and evidence of left medial thalamic infarct on diffusion-weighted imaging without coexisting midbrain ischemia. The etiology of infarct was determined to be small vessel disease after extensive investigation. Conclusions This report suggests a possible role of the thalamus as a <b>vertical</b> gaze <b>control</b> <b>center.</b> Clinicoradiological studies are needed to further define the role of the thalamus in vertical gaze control. </p...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{visualizations}} of {{the three}} dimensional (3 D) convection patterns generated near an evaporating meniscus in horizontally oriented capillary tubes are presented. These patterns are caused due to the differential evaporation along the meniscus. In this study, transparent capillary tubes with refractive index close {{to that of the}} evaporating liquid were used to minimize refraction effects and obtain velocity vectors near the walls. Polystyrene fluorescent particles of 0. 5 lm diameter suspended in methanol were used to make the measure- ments in tubes of 75, 200 and 400 lm diameter. For the 75 lm tube, gravity was observed to have no effect on the flow patterns and an axisymmetric counter-rotating vortex pair was present along the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>center</b> planes, suggesting the presence of a toroidal vortex near the meniscus. With an increase in tube size, buoyancy effects became apparent as the axisymmetric pattern broke down. A counter-rotating symmetric vortex pair was observed in the horizontal center plane, whereas in the <b>vertical</b> <b>center</b> plane, a single vortex dominated the flow and pushed the secondary vortex to a corner. Particle streak and lPIV images were obtained in multiple horizontal planes and a <b>vertical</b> <b>center</b> plane to understand this 3 D flow behavior...|$|R

40|$|The {{strengths}} of interpersonal dyads {{formed by the}} attacker and defender in one-on-one situations are crucial for performance in team ball sports such as soccer. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze the kinematics of one-on-one defensive movements in soccer competitions, and determine the relationships between lower limb kinematics and the center of mass translation during cutting actions. Six defensive scenes in which a player was responding to an offender’s dribble attack were selected for analysis. To reconstruct the three-dimensional kinematics of the players, we used a photogrammetric model-based image-matching technique. The hip and knee kinematics were calculated from the matched skeleton model. In addition, the center of mass height was expressed as a ratio of each participant’s body height. The relationships between the center of mass height and the kinematics were determined by the Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient. The normalized center of mass height at initial contact was correlated with the <b>vertical</b> <b>center</b> of mass displacement (r = 0. 832, p = 0. 040) and hip flexion angle at initial contact (r = − 0. 823, p = 0. 044). This suggests that the lower center of mass at initial contact is an important factor to reduce the downwards <b>vertical</b> <b>center</b> of mass translation during defensive cutting actions, and that this is executed primarily through hip flexion. It is therefore recommended that players land with an adequately flexed hip at initial contact during one-on-one cutting actions to minimize the <b>vertical</b> <b>center</b> of mass excursion...|$|R

Three silicon plane mirrors (A, B, and C flats) were combined in pairs with different positional combinations (transmission reference A and detected B, A and C, and B and C) in the interferometer and used for calculation of the absolute line profile of each silicon plane mirror by the three-flat method [2]. The absolute line profile could be measured only along a <b>vertical</b> <b>center</b> line on the reference and detected flats. The B flat in the combination B and C was rotated around the <b>vertical</b> <b>center</b> line compared to the B flat in the combination A and B. The position of {{the center and the}} direction of the center line on the detected flat were adjusted to be the same as those on the reference flat within 1 pixel of the CCD camera (which has 640 × 480 pixels). One pixel corresponds to 107 μm on the flat.|$|R
