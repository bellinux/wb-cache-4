40|$|Vacuum {{preloading}} is {{a ground}} improvement technique in which effective stress in soil is increased by reducing pore-water pressure. To understand the pore-water pressure, effective stress changes and deformation mechanism of soft soil subjected to underwater vacuum preloading, theoretical analysis, centrifuge modelling and numerical modelling were carried out. Analytical solutions of average degree of radial consolidation of soft clay subjected to vacuum preloading were developed. Well resistance, smear effect, vacuum loss, large lateral deformation and variation of soil stiffness and permeability are considered. Centrifuge tests of clay {{with a single}} <b>vertical</b> <b>sand</b> <b>drain</b> and a <b>vertical</b> <b>sand</b> <b>drain</b> group at a spacing of 8 D (D is drain diameter) were carried out. Subsurface displacement was measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV) and photogrammetry. Coupled axis-symmetric and coupled three-dimensional finite-element analyses were carried out to model consolidation behaviour of soft clay subjected to underwater vacuum preloading with a vertical drain group. Numerical experiments were carried out to investigate the behaviour of soft clay subjected to underwater vacuum preloading, on-land vacuum preloading and underwater surcharge preloading under idealized boundary conditions. Both measured and computed rates of consolidation with a vertical drain group were greater than those with a single vertical drain. Measured surface settlement near a vertical drain was 80 % of that away from the vertical drain. Measured maximum inward lateral displacement between vertical drains in centrifuge tests was about 5 % surface settlement. At the centre of a vertical drain group, final lateral earth pressure coefficient {{at the end of}} underwater and on-land vacuum preloading is greater than lateral earth pressure coefficient at rest, while that in underwater surcharge preloading is less than lateral earth pressure coefficient at rest. Computed inward lateral displacement {{at the edge of a}} treated zone is about 27 % of surface settlement by underwater and on-land vacuum preloading. The magnitude of computed lateral displacement by underwater or on-land vacuum preloading is 16 % of that by underwater surcharge preloading. At a distance of 18. 5 m from the treated zone, the magnitude of computed lateral displacement by underwater and on-land vacuum preloading is 22 % of maximum surface settlement, while that by underwater surcharge preloading is 1 % of maximum surface settlement...|$|E

Unfortunately, the installation of <b>vertical</b> <b>sand</b> <b>drains</b> have become less economically viable due to the high costs and limited availability of good quality sand. Particle size distribution analyses done on samples of waste copper slag obtained from the Colombo dockyard revealed that its gradation was similar to that of sand, which meant that waste copper slag could potentially be used {{as a substitute}} for sand, provided that it did not adversely affect the hydraulic conductivity of the resulting mixture. In this study, constant head permeability tests were done on "sand-copper slag" mixes of varying proportions and it was shown that up to 50 % copper slag by weight could be added to sand without an appreciable loss in permeability. The performance of sand piles is dependent on strength and settlement characteristics of the sand. Hence, consolidation tests and direct shear tests were also carried out on the "sand-copper slag" mixes to explore how the mechanical properties of sand were affected by the copper slag...|$|R

If <b>vertical</b> <b>sand</b> <b>drains</b> are used, {{they can be}} installed at different diameters.

Design curves are developed for prefabricated vertical drains in this paper. The equivalent drain diameter is used as the independent variable and drain spacing becomes the dependent variable. Soil smear around the drain is considered but well resistance of the drain is neglected.

Coupled stress-flow analysis using the method of finite elements areperformed, with emphasis on predicting the behaviour of the seawall and the nearbyabutment for the access bridge. Elastoplastic and creep properties of the Quaternaryclays is considered in the analysis procedure in a consistent way, through the im-plementation of a plane-strain elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model. The predictedperformance emphasizes the importance of the long-term consolidation of the pleisto-cene clays, in terms of post-construction deformation, as compared with the behavi-our of the overlying soft alluvial clay that is treated partly with columns of denselycompacted sand (SCP) and more extensively with <b>vertical</b> <b>sand</b> <b>drains</b> (SD). It isshown that the vertical stress tends to concentrate into the SCP-treated region ad-joining the more compressible SD-treated region, and that such stress concentrationaccounts for the peak occurring in the profile of compression of the pleistoceneclays along the axis of the access bridge. It is also shown that the initially over-consolidated pleistocene clays undergo yielding in their upper part, along with thegradual dissipation of excess porewater pressures, and that the front of yielding pro-gresses downwards with time. Such delayed yielding is shown to be predominantwell after the end of construction and is accompanied by the delayed, laterally out-ward deformation of the pleistocene clays.

The present paper uses the differential quadrature method (DQM) for axisymmetric consolidation of unsaturated soils in a <b>sand</b> <b>drain</b> foundation. The radial seepage of <b>sand</b> <b>drain</b> foundation is considered based on the framework of Fredlund’s one-dimensional consolidation theory in unsaturated soils. With the use of Darcy’s law and Fick’s law, the polar governing equations of excess pore-air and pore-water pressures of axisymmetric consolidation are derived. By using DQM, the two governing equations are transformed into two sets of ordinary differential equations. Then the solutions of excess pore-water and pore-air pressures can be obtained by Rong-Kutta method. The DQM solution can be used to deal with the case of nonuniform initial pore-air and pore-water distributions.

The shallow subsurface of these low-lying areas consists mainly of very soft highly compressible organic soils or soft alluvial deposits. Due to the high flood levels above the existing ground surface in the low-lying areas, high embankments are needed to avoid flooding of the highway. As a result, geotechnical engineers are faced with a tremendous challenge of construction of high embankments over thick very soft highly compressible soil deposits. Due to shear failure and large settlement of the soft soil deposits under the embankment loading, these soft soil deposits must be improved before the placing of the embankment fill or during placing the fill. There are different types of treatment methods used in Sri Lanka such as preloading, preloading with <b>vertical</b> <b>drains,</b> <b>sand</b> columns, stone columns, piled embankment, vacuum consolidation etc. The actual method of treatment depends mainly on the thickness of the soft deposit, consolidation and shear strength properties of the soft deposit, height of the embankment etc. Therefore, it is essential that the properties of the soft soil are determined during the initial stage of the design to decide the type of the soft ground treatment method as well as during the design stage.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the performance of geogrid reinforced soil walls with panel facing using marginal backfill with and without chimney <b>sand</b> <b>drain</b> subjected to seepage. A series of centrifuge model tests were performed at 40 gravities using a 4. 5 m radius large beam centrifuge facility available at IIT Bombay. The results revealed that a geogrid reinforced soil wall with low stiffness geogrid and without any chimney drain experienced a catastrophic failure due to excess pore water pressure that developed in the reinforced and backfill zones at the onset of seepage. In comparison, a soil wall reinforced with stiff geogrid layers was found to perform effectively even at the onset of seepage. Provision of chimney <b>sand</b> <b>drain</b> effectively decreased pore water pressure not only at the wall toe but also at mid distance from toe of the wall and thereby resulted in enhancing the wall performance under the effect of seepage forces. However, a local piping failure was observed near the toe region of the wall. The observed centrifuge test results were further analysed by performing seepage and stability analyses to evaluate the effect of thickness of sand layer in a chimney drain. An increase in thickness of sand layer in chimney drain was found to improve the discharge values and thereby enhancing the factor of safety against piping near the toe region. Based on the analysis and interpretation of centrifuge test results, it can be concluded that marginal soil can be used as a backfill in reinforced soil walls provided, it has geogrid layers of adequate stiffness and/or proper chimney drain configuration.
