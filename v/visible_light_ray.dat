40|$|Seeing {{an object}} in a {{cluttered}} scene with severe occlusion is a significantly challenging task for many computer vision applications. Although camera array synthetic aperture imaging {{has proven to be}} an effective way for occluded object imaging, its imaging quality is often significantly decreased by the shadows of the foreground occluder. To overcome this problem, some recent research has been presented to label the foreground occluder via object segmentation or 3 D reconstruction. However, these methods usually fail in the case of complicated occluder or severe occlusion. In this paper, we present a novel optimal camera selection algorithm to handle the problem above. Firstly, in contrast to the traditional synthetic aperture photography methods, we formulate the occluded object imaging as a problem of <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> <b>ray</b> selection from the optimal camera view. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} to “mosaic” a high quality occluded object image via selecting multi-view optimal visible light rays from a camera array or a single moving camera. Secondly, a greedy optimization framework is presented to propagate the visibility information among various depth focus planes. Thirdly, a multiple label energy minimization formulation is designed in each plane to select the optimal camera view. The energy is estimated in the 3 D synthetic aperture image volume and integrates the multiple view intensity consistency, previous visibility property and camera view smoothness, which is minimized via graph cuts. Finally, we compare this approach with the traditional synthetic aperture imaging algorithms on UCSD light field datasets and our own datasets captured in indoor and outdoor environment, and extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a novel tricolor {{dot matrix}} display {{system in which}} all the LEDs are {{modulated}} and encoded with audio information is presented. The novelty is on the concurrent use of the tricolor LEDs for simultaneous visual message display and audio signal transmission in a free space optical link. The system is comprised of a tricolor LED dot matrix display panel with an interface circuit to a computer, an audio signal transmitter, and a receiver. The system further comprises an executive program that runs on the computer for the display control of characters, decorative pattern or messages on the display panel. The receiver, combined with a speaker, is located at some distance from the display system. The receiver is designed to demodulate the optically transmitted audio information and reproduce the messages with the speaker. For modulating emission of tricolor LEDs, an oscillator is used to vary the frequency of on/off periods of the LEDs. The frequency of flicker is high enough to be indistinguishable by human eye and hence display appears to be constantly illuminated. This is a new generation of tricolor LED dot matrix display where in addition to the usual function of LED display, they concurrently provide audio broadcasting through the <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> transmitted by the display panel or assembly. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

With more than 200 illustrations, the book discusses electromagnetic force and sychrotron radiation comprising all kinds of waves, including gamma rays, x-rays, UV <b>rays,</b> <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> <b>rays,</b> infrared, microwaves, and radio waves. It also covers topics of common interest, such as quasars, pulsars, the Big Bang theory, Olbers' paradox, black holes, Mars mission, and SETI.

It next discusses the Fourier series and transform in both continuous and discrete cases and analyzes the Dirichlet kernel and Gibbs phenomenon. The author shows how invertibility and periodicity of Fourier transforms are used in the development of signals and filters, addresses the general concept of communication systems, and explains the functioning of a GPS receiver. The author then covers the theory of Fourier optics, synchrotron light and x-ray diffraction, the mathematics of radioastronomy, and mathematical structures in poetry and music.

The traditional method of teaching CT principles involves classroom lectures, with demonstrations on a clinical system {{that can only be}} accessed during off-hours. The x-ray and ‘black-box’ nature of a clinical system, and the lag time between lectures and demonstrations severely limit the teaching efficiency. A scaled-down portable imaging system that does not use x-rays would be ideal for an interactive classroom or laboratory session. We therefore developed a system using <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> instead of x-rays, so that experiments can be conducted immediately and safely with no high-voltage or radiation hazards. Educators at the University of Western Ontario will collaborate with industry to manufacture the scanner ([URL] to meet educational objectives, such as those specified by the Commission on the Accreditation of Medical Physics Education Programs (CAMPEP).

25|$|Because neutrinos {{interact}} {{so little}} with matter, {{it is thought}} that a supernova's neutrino emissions carry information about the innermost regions of the explosion. Much of the <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> comes from the decay of radioactive elements produced by the supernova shock wave, and even light from the explosion itself is scattered by dense and turbulent gases, and thus delayed. The neutrino burst is expected to reach Earth before any electromagnetic waves, including <b>visible</b> <b>light,</b> gamma <b>rays</b> or radio waves. The exact time delay depends on the velocity of the shock wave and on the thickness of the outer layer of the star. For a Type II supernova, astronomers expect the neutrino flood to be released seconds after the stellar core collapse, while the first electromagnetic signal may emerge hours later, after the explosion shock wave has had time to reach the surface of the star. The Supernova Early Warning System project uses a network of neutrino detectors to monitor the sky for candidate supernova events; the neutrino signal will provide a useful advance warning of a star exploding in the Milky Way.|$|R
40|$|This project {{involves}} {{the design of}} a piece of apparatus, which uses Computed Tomography(CT) to form a cross-sectional image of a three-dimensional object. An alternate term for this imaging technique is Computer-Assisted Tomography (CAT). CAT Scans are often used by radiologists to examine a single cross-section or structure in a patient's body. In the X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum, the entire human body is nearly transparent. Although X-rays can pass through the body, it can not be considered perfectly transparent, since the X-rays are attenuated to various degrees by the bones, tissues, air spaces and other components of the body. This apparatus uses <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> to preform a CT Scan. The human body is opaque in the <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> range of the spectrum, therefore it cannot be analyzed with this system. However, the apparatus does model one mode of scanning which could be used on the human body with an X-ray source and detector. Instead of producing an image of a selected cross section of the human body,this apparatus will produce an image of a cross section of a sample object within a clear fluid. Both the sample and the fluid are sufficiently inopaque, such that the light beam from a helium-neon laser can pass through them. The sample is colored so that it absorbs some range of light frequencies and therefore reduces the intensity of the laser beam. In the scanning mode which was implemented, pencil beam "incremental" scanning, there is a single x-ray source and a single detector. The detector and the source move {{along the length of the}} sample in parallel in a direction perpendicular to the laser beam which passes through the sample to the detector. The projection data are collected periodically throughout this motion. This constitutes one set of parallel rays. The sample then rotates by a small amount (typically 1 °). By repetition of these two motions, data are collected for a large number (typically 180) sets of parallel rays. The raw analog data from the scan is converted to digital form and stored in a file on the computer. With appropriate processing this data could be used to form a graphic image of the cross-section of the sample on the computer screen...|$|R

Detection of the gravitational waves from these objects will open a new door of `gravitational wave astronomy'. Gravitational wave will be a probe to study the physics and astrophysics. To search these gravitational waves, large-scale laser interferometers will compose a global network of detectors. Advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo are upgrading from currents detectors.
