5000|$|Although <b>viroids</b> are {{composed}} of nucleic acid, they do not code for any protein. The <b>viroid's</b> replication mechanism uses RNA polymerase II, a host cell enzyme normally associated with synthesis of messenger RNA from DNA, which instead catalyzes [...] "rolling circle" [...] synthesis of new RNA using the <b>viroid's</b> RNA as a template. Some <b>viroids</b> are ribozymes, having catalytic properties which allow self-cleavage and ligation of unit-size genomes from larger replication intermediates.|$|R
40|$|Nucleic acid sequence-based {{amplification}} (NASBA) {{according to}} the standard protocol failed to amplify cRNA of <b>viroids,</b> probably because of their GC-rich and intramolecular base-paired structure. However, NASBA {{in the presence of}} inosine 5 '-triphosphate successfully amplified the cRNAs to <b>viroids</b> in total nucleic acid extracts from citrus plants. As sequence specificity of the cRNA to <b>viroids</b> was confirmed by northern analysis, the amplification and fidelity of cRNAs are sufficient for the sensitive and specific detection of <b>viroids...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Viroids,</b> subviral {{pathogens}} of plants, {{are composed}} of a single-stranded circular RNA of 246 – 399 nucle-otides. Within the 27 <b>viroids</b> sequenced, avocado sunblotch, peach latent mosaic and chrysanthemum chlorotic mottle <b>viroids</b> (ASBVd, PLMVd and CChMVd, respectively) can form hammerhead structures in both of their polarity strands. These ribozymes medi-ate self-cleavage of the oligomeric RNAs generated in the replication through a rolling circle mechanism, whose two other steps are catalyzed by an RNA poly-merase and an RNA ligase. ASBVd, and presumably PLMVd and CChMVd, replicate and accumulate in the chloroplast, whereas typical <b>viroids</b> replicate and accumulate in the nucleus. PLMVd and CChMVd do not adopt a rod-like or quasi rod-like secondary struc-ture as typical <b>viroids</b> do but have a highly branched conformation. A pathogenicity determinant has been mapped in a defined region of the CChMVd molecule...|$|R
50|$|The hop stunt <b>viroid</b> (abbreviated HSVd) is a <b>viroid</b> {{species that}} infects the common hop plant, citrus plants and grapevines, among others. It {{is a member}} of the Pospiviroidae family and the Hostuviroid genus.There are quite a few {{different}} sub-species of the hop stunt <b>viroid.</b>|$|E
50|$|The first {{recognized}} <b>viroid,</b> the {{pathogenic agent}} of the potato spindle tuber disease, was discovered, initially molecularly characterized, and named by Theodor Otto Diener, plant pathologist at the U.S Department of Agriculture's Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland, in 1971. This <b>viroid</b> is now called Potato spindle tuber <b>viroid,</b> abbreviated PSTVd.|$|E

50|$|<b>Viroids</b> are the {{smallest}} infectious pathogens known. They are solely {{composed of a}} short strand of circular, single-stranded RNA without protein coat. All known <b>viroids</b> are inhabitants of higher plants, in which most cause diseases, {{some of which are}} of slight to catastrophic economic importance.|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is {{a distant}} {{relative}} of plant <b>viroids</b> {{in the animal}} world. Similar to plant <b>viroids,</b> HDV replicates its circular RNA genome using a double rolling-circle mechanism. Nevertheless, the production of hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), which is indispensible for HDV replication, is a unique feature distinct from plant <b>viroids,</b> which do not encode any protein. Here the HDV RNA replication cycle is reviewed, with emphasis on the function of HDAg in modulating RNA replication {{and the nature of}} the enzyme involved...|$|R
40|$|<b>Viroids</b> are non-encapsidated, non-coding, circular, {{single-stranded}} RNAs (ssRNAs). They {{are classified}} into the families Pospiviroidae and Avsunviroidae, whose members replicate in the nucleus and chloroplast of plant cells, respectively. <b>Viroids</b> {{have a wide}} host range, including crop and ornamental plants, and can cause devastating diseases with significant economic losses. Thus, several <b>viroids</b> are world-wide, classified as quarantine pathogens and, hence, there is an urgent need {{for the development of}} robust antiviroid strategies. RNA silencing-based technologies seem to be a promising tool in this direction. Here, we review the recent advances concerning the complex interaction of <b>viroids</b> with the host’s RNA silencing machinery, evaluate past and present antiviroid approaches, and finally suggest alternative strategies that could potentially be employed in the future in order to achieve transgenic and non-transgenic viroid-free plants...|$|R
50|$|Coconut Cadang Cadang <b>Viroid</b> (CCCVd) can be {{confused}} with another <b>viroid</b> called Coconut Tinangaja <b>Viroid</b> (CTiVd). That is because both viroids have 64% of their sequence of nucleotides in common. They both affect coconut palms (monocots), and infected plants have similar symptoms: spots on the leaves reduced top, yellow palms and even death.|$|E
50|$|The amount (titre) of <b>viroid</b> {{particles}} {{present in}} avocado trees varies a great deal. Viroids levels can vary by 1000 times between branches {{on the same}} tree and by 10000 times between trees. Infected but symptomless trees have a higher concentration of <b>viroid</b> particles than those showing symptoms. Symptomless trees also represent a greater danger in terms of spread of the <b>viroid.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Guam, {{a similar}} <b>viroid</b> known as coconut tinangaja <b>viroid</b> (CTiVd) {{has been found}} that causes a similar disease named tinangaja disease. This <b>viroid</b> has 64% {{sequence}} homology with the cadang-cadang viroid.There are other related viroids with the CCCVd, which are found in Asia and the South Pacific. They have a high degree of homology but the pathogenicity is uncertain.|$|E

50|$|Peach latent mosaic <b>viroid</b> {{is a type}} {{species from}} the genus Pelamoviroid, which belongs to the family Avsunviroidae. This family is {{characterized}} as having chloroplastic viroids with hammerhead ribozymes. Peach latent mosaic <b>viroid</b> is a 336-351nt circular RNA which has a branched formation. This branched formation is stabilised by a pseudoknot between two kissing loops. Peach latent mosaic <b>viroid</b> was first described in the 1980s in Spain {{by a group of}} scientists.|$|E
50|$|There {{has long}} been {{uncertainty}} over how viroids induce symptoms in plants without encoding any protein products within their sequences. Evidence suggests that RNA silencing {{is involved in the}} process. First, changes to the <b>viroid</b> genome can dramatically alter its virulence. This reflects the fact that any siRNAs produced would have less complementary base pairing with target messenger RNA. Secondly, siRNAs corresponding to sequences from <b>viroid</b> genomes have been isolated from infected plants. Finally, transgenic expression of the noninfectious hpRNA of potato spindle tuber <b>viroid</b> develops all the corresponding viroid-like symptoms. This indicates that when viroids replicate via a double stranded intermediate RNA, they are targeted by a dicer enzyme and cleaved into siRNAs that are then loaded onto the RNA-induced silencing complex. The <b>viroid</b> siRNAs contain sequences capable of complementary base pairing with the plant's own messenger RNAs, and induction of degradation or inhibition of translation causes the classic <b>viroid</b> symptoms.|$|E
50|$|The Potato {{spindle tuber}} <b>viroid</b> ("PSTVd") {{was the first}} <b>viroid</b> to be identified. PSTVd is a small, {{circular}} RNA molecule {{closely related to the}} chrysanthemum stunt <b>viroid.</b> Present within the viroidal RNA is the Pospiviroid RY motif stem loop. The natural hosts are potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum). All potatoes and tomatoes are susceptible to PSTVd and there is no form of natural resistance. Natural infections have also been seen in avocados and infections in other solanaceous crops have been induced in the laboratory.|$|E
50|$|As cogently {{expressed}} by Flores et al.:“viruses (and <b>viroids)</b> share the most characteristic property of living beings: In an appropriate environment, {{they are able}} to generate copiesof themselves, in other words, they are endowed with autonomous replication (and evolution). It is in this framework where <b>viroids</b> represent the frontier of life (246 to 467nt), anaspect that should attract the attention of anybody interested in biology.”.|$|R
5000|$|In 1989, Diener {{proposed}} that, {{based on}} their characteristic properties, <b>viroids</b> are more plausible [...] "living relics" [...] of the RNA world than are introns or other RNAs then so considered. If so, <b>viroids</b> have attained potential significance beyond plant pathology to evolutionary biology, by representing the most plausible macromolecules known capable of explaining crucial intermediate steps {{in the evolution of}} life from inanimate matter (see: abiogenesis).|$|R

50|$|<b>Viroids</b> {{are mostly}} plant pathogens, which consist of short {{stretches}} (a few hundred nucleobases) of highly complementary, circular, single-stranded, and non-coding RNAs without a protein coat. Compared with other infectious plant pathogens, <b>viroids</b> are extremely small in size, ranging from 246 to 467 nucleobases; they thus consist {{of fewer than}} 10,000 atoms. In comparison, the genome of the smallest known viruses capable of causing an infection by themselves are around 2,000 nucleobases long.|$|R
