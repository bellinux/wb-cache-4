40|$|Supercritical CO 2 (scCO 2) was {{investigated}} {{for use in}} the processing of <b>vitrified</b> <b>bonded</b> abrasives. In this study, two novel technologies were developed; selective extraction of pore inducers from <b>vitrified</b> <b>bonded</b> abrasives and thin film deposition of lubricants into <b>vitrified</b> <b>bonded</b> abrasives from supercritical solutions. ^ Highly porous vitrified grinding wheels were produced by selective extraction of pore inducers with dense CO 2. This technology was developed {{as an alternative to the}} conventional thermal technique. Green grinding wheels were made with CO 2 soluble pore inducers which were subsequently subjected to scCO 2. The extraction rate was a function of temperature, flow rate, and flow direction. The vanishing kinematic viscosity of scCO 2, combined with the relatively large solubility of the pore inducers, led to strong natural convention currents. The system was modeled using a coupled set of equations for external mass transfer and internal diffusion, with an average absolute error of 3. 4 %. Grinding tests demonstrated the scCO 2 extracted wheels performed as well if not better then conventional pore induced wheels. ^ Supercritical CO 2 was used for the deposition of fine films within <b>vitrified</b> <b>bonded</b> grinding wheels. <b>Vitrified</b> <b>bonded</b> abrasives were placed in a solution of lubricant dissolved in scCO 2. Upon depressurization, the solution passed through the cloud point and the lubricant precipitated out of solution and was deposited within the pore matrix of the grinding wheel. The mass of material impregnated was only a function of concentration in solution, indicating the deposition was uniform and the thickness of the deposits was controllable. The impregnated grinding wheels were subjected to grinding tests and had superior performance compared to grinding wheel standards. ^ In order to investigate the phenomena governing the deposition within the wheel, a glass pore was developed to model the system. The effect of supersaturation {{was investigated}} by altering the rate of approach to the cloud point. Rapid expansion led to high supersaturations and micron to submicron particles deposited uniformly throughout the pore. Deposition by temperature quench led to both heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation.

40|$|Abstract: The {{performance}} of vitrified silicon carbide grinding wheels {{is dependent on}} the molten properties of their bonding systems. The erosion of silicon carbide during the manufacture of grinding wheels is enhanced by the action of high glass content <b>vitrified</b> <b>bonding</b> systems that reduces their wear resistance during the grinding process. Replacing the glass content of the bond with a clay that does not vitrify can improve their wear resistance. However, the harmful effects of quartz particles that are found in clay minerals need to be eliminated during the firing process before the grinding wheels are used to grind precision engineering components. A mathematical model describing the dissolution of quartz in refractory bonding systems was compared with experimental data using X-ray diffraction techniques. It was found that when grinding wheels were isothermally heat treated, the residual mass fraction of quartz was found to be a function of time. When compared with experimental data, the model was found to be accurate for short periods of heat treatment that are associated with vitrified silicon carbide firing cycles.

40|$|Nanoscale {{fabrication}} {{requires a}} substrate made from an engineering material {{to be truly}} flat so that “bottom-up” nanofabrication techniques such as lithographically induced self-assembly and soft lithography {{can be used to}} deposit nanofeatures. The coating of piezoelectric materials with sub-micron size diamond particles has enabled the production of truly flat substrates so that nanofeatures can be created on engineering materials using a new manufacturing process known as “piezoelectric nanogrinding”. The principle of the process relies on applying an electric current to the diamond coated piezoelectric material that causes the material to strain. When the diamond-coated piezoelectric material is placed in close proximity to the substrate, the diamonds remove extremely small fragments of the substrate when the electric current is applied to the material. The magnitude of the applied current controls the material removal rate. The process can be used to process biomedical materials especially in the production of nanoscale ducts and channels in micro-and nanofluidic devices. To achieve the generation of truly flat surfaces, the process must be executed within a specially constructed vibration dampening space frame. The chapter describes the principle of the process of nanogrinding using coated piezoelectric materials, and correlates the wear of diamonds with stresses induced into the diamonds when an electric current is applied to the piezoelectric in order to remove very small amounts of material. The removal of material can also be performed using a porous tool with abrasive materials embedded in them such as diamonds that increases the material removal rate as long as the porous tool is engineered {{in such a way that}} the loss of abrasive fragments is eliminated.

40|$|Grinding is a {{critical}} manufacturing process and is often the only alternative when producing precision components or when machining brittle materials such as ceramics. Characterizing and modeling the surface finish in the grinding process is a difficult task due to the stochastic nature of the size, shape and spatial distribution of abrasive grains {{that make up the}} surface of grinding wheels. Since the surface finish obtained in grinding is a direct function of the wheel surface topography, which is conditioned by a single point dressing process, understanding the effects of dressing parameters on the wheel topography is essential. Therefore, the main objectives of this thesis are: 1) to experimentally characterize the three-dimensional surface topography of a conventional grinding wheel including attributes such as the abrasive grain height distribution, grain geometry and spacing parameters and their respective statistical distributions, 2) {{to determine the effects of}} single point dressing conditions on the three-dimensional wheel surface topography parameters and their distributions, 3) to model and simulate the three-dimensional wheel surface topography, and 4) to experimentally validate the wheel topography model. In this research, new and existing characterization methods are used to characterize the wheel surface and the individual abrasive grains. The new techniques include the use of X-ray micro-tomography (μCT) to obtain a better understanding of the grinding wheel's internal micro-structure, and a focus variation based optical measurement method and scanning electron microscopy to characterize previously ignored attributes such as the number of sides and aspect ratio of individual grains. A seeded gel (SG) <b>vitrified</b> <b>bond</b> conventional grinding wheel is used in the study. A full factorial design of single point wheel dressing experiments is performed to investigate the effects infeed and lead dressing parameters on the grinding wheel surface topography. A custom wheel indexing apparatus is built to facilitate precision relocation of the grinding wheel surface to enable optical comparison of the pre- and post-dressing wheel surface topography to observe wheel surface generation mechanisms such as macro-fracture and grain dislodgement. Quantitative descriptions of how each dressing parameter affects the wheel surface characteristics are given in terms of the wheel surface roughness amplitude parameters (Sp, Ssk, Sku) and areal and volume parameters (Spk, Sk, Vmp, Vmp, Vvc, Smr 1) derived from the bearing area curve. A three-dimensional wheel topography simulation model that takes as input the abrasive grain height distribution and the statistical distributions for the various abrasive grain geometry parameters is developed and experimentally validated. The results of wheel characterization studies show that the actual abrasive grain height distribution in the SG wheel follows a beta distribution. The μCT work shows that the abrasives are polyhedral in shape, as opposed to the spherical or conical shapes commonly assumed in grinding literature. Grain spacing is found to follow a beta distribution while the number of sides of the grain and the grain aspect ratio are found to follow the gamma and the Weibull distribution, respectively. The results of the dressing study show that the lead dressing parameter has the strongest effect on wheel topography. Using statistical distributions for the key parameters (e. g. grain height, number of sides, grain spacing), a stochastic three-dimensional model is developed to simulate the wheel surface topography under different dressing conditions. The resulting model is shown to yield realistic results compared to existing models mainly due the fact that additional abrasive grain geometry parameters and more realistic assumptions of the different grain attributes are used in the model. It is shown that the model follows the overall wheel surface topography trends during dressing but has difficulty in accurately simulating some of the wheel characteristics under specific dressing conditions. The thesis then concludes with a summary of the main findings and possible future research avenues including extending the model to rotary dressing and simulation of wheel-workpiece interaction. M.
