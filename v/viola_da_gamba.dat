5|$|Several musical {{instruments}} have been found, including a trumpet, three violins and a <b>viola</b> <b>da</b> <b>gamba,</b> all expensive objects that probably belonged {{to either the}} officers or the trumpeters. One of the trumpeters on board {{was a member of}} the admiral's musical ensemble and it is assumed that one of the particularly fine, German-made instruments belonged to him. Another remnant of the officers' personal stores was discovered in 1997, consisting of a woven basket filled with tobacco and expensive imported foodstuffs and spices, including ginger, plums, grapes and cinnamon quills.|$|E
5|$|The cantata is {{structured}} {{in two parts}} of seven movements each, to be performed {{before and after the}} sermon. It is scored for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir SATB, trumpet (Tr), two oboes (Ob), oboe d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), <b>viola</b> <b>da</b> <b>gamba</b> (Vg) and basso continuo (Bc). The two parts of seven movements each are composed as the same arrangement of alternating recitatives and arias with a concluding chorale, only Part II is opened by a sinfonia instead of a chorus. The duration is given as 35 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The work is scored for vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir SATB, and an {{orchestra}} of two flauto traverso (Ft), two oboes (Ob), two oboes da caccia (Oc), two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins, viola (Va), and basso continuo. Bach added some instruments which were already old-fashioned {{at the time}} in arias for special effects, such as the archlute, the viola d'amore and the <b>viola</b> <b>da</b> <b>gamba</b> (Vg). Bach did not differentiate the vox Christi (voice of Christ), singing the words of Jesus, from the other bass recitatives and arias, nor the evangelist from the tenor arias.|$|E

5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{analysis}} the music scholar Jane Glover has divided Monteverdi's list of instruments into three main groups: strings, brass and continuo, with a few further items not easily classifiable. The strings grouping is formed from ten members of the violin family (viole da brazzo), two double basses (contrabassi de viola), and two small violins (violini piccoli alla francese). The viole da brazzo are in two five-part ensembles, each comprising two violins, two violas and a cello. The brass group contains four or five trombones (sackbuts), three trumpets and two cornetts. The continuo forces include two harpsichords (duoi gravicembani), a double harp (arpa doppia), two or three chitarroni, two pipe organs (organi di legno), three bass <b>viola</b> <b>da</b> <b>gamba,</b> and a regal or small reed organ. Outside of these groupings are two recorders (flautini alla vigesima secunda), and possibly one or more citterns—unlisted by Monteverdi, but included in instructions relating {{to the end of}} act 4.|$|E

25|$|In concerted {{playing in}} Bach's time the basso continuo, {{consisting}} of instruments such as organ, and/or <b>viola</b> <b>da</b> <b>gamba</b> and harpsichord, usually had {{the role of}} accompaniment: providing the harmonic and rhythmic foundation of a piece. From the late 1720s, Bach had the organ play concertante (i.e. as soloist) with the orchestra in instrumental cantata movements, a decade before Handel published his first organ concertos. Apart from the 5th Brandenburg Concerto and the Triple Concerto, which already had harpsichord soloists in the 1720s, Bach wrote and arranged his harpsichord concertos in the 1730s, and in his sonatas for <b>viola</b> <b>da</b> <b>gamba</b> and harpsichord neither instrument plays a continuo part: they are treated as equal soloists, way beyond the figured bass role. In this sense, Bach {{played a key role}} in the development of genres such as the keyboard concerto.|$|E

25|$|Pallis studied music under Arnold Dolmetsch, the {{distinguished}} reviver of early English music, composer, and performer, {{and was considered}} “one of Dolmetsch's most devoted protégés”.
