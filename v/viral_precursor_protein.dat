40|$|Virus-like {{particle}} (VLP) vaccines {{are emerging}} as an exciting {{platform for the}} delivery of antigenic modules to enable engineering of desirable immunological outcomes, both in therapeutic and prophylactic settings. The processing of these macromolecular assemblies raises new challenges not previously encountered for simpler protein therapeutics. Microbial expression of <b>viral</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> complexes (capsomeres) and their subsequent cell-free self-assembly represent a new and technologically interesting pathway to VLP vaccines, yet significant scientific and engineering challenges remain. Among these, the use of thrombin within the existing laboratory process must be eliminated, for regulatory, cost and product quality reasons. Here, the use of alternatives to thrombin is explored. It is shown that tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp) is {{a viable alternative to}} thrombin, and leads to higher-quality VLP product; as TEVp has no known human physiological or biochemical role, its bioprocessing acceptability is expected to be higher than for thrombin. The results presented here enhance the scale-up potential of microbial VLP processing, and suggest that TEVp may be a preferable enzyme for use in other bioprocess settings, including those related to the processing of less complex biologics...|$|E
40|$|International audienceChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted Alphavirus {{that causes}} in humans an acute {{infection}} characterized by polyarthralgia, fever, myalgia, and headache. Since 2005 this virus {{has been responsible}} for an epidemic outbreak of unprecedented magnitude. By analogy with other alphaviruses, it is thought that cellular proteases are able to process the <b>viral</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> E 3 E 2 to produce the receptor-binding E 2 protein that associates as a heterodimer with E 1. Destabilization of the heterodimer by exposure to low pH allows viral fusion and infection. We show that among a large panel of proprotein convertases, membranous furin but also PC 5 B can process E 3 E 2 from African CHIKV strains at the HRQRR(64) / ST site, whereas a CHIKV strain of Asian origin is cleaved at RRQRR(64) / SI by membranous and soluble furin, PC 5 A, PC 5 B, and PACE 4 but not by PC 7 or SKI- 1. Using fluorogenic model peptides and recombinant convertases, we observed that the Asian strain E 3 E 2 model peptide is cleaved most efficiently by furin and PC 5 A. This cleavage was also observed in CHIKV-infected cells and could be blocked by furin inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone. This inhibitor was compared with chloroquine for its ability to inhibit CHIKV spreading in myoblast cell cultures, a cell-type previously described as a natural target of this virus. Our results demonstrate the role of furin-like proteases in the processing of CHIKV particles and point out new approaches to inhibit this infection...|$|E
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is an enveloped RNA virus {{belonging to the}} lentivirus genus of retroviruses. Like other type-C retroviruses, HIV assembly and budding occur concurrently at the plasma membrane of infected cells. Consequently the formation of HIV virus particles requires that the key structural components of the virus, and the viral genomic RNA, are brought together at the cellular membrane where new particles are assembled. The formation of infectious HIV viral particles is driven principally by the HIV Gag poly-precursor protein via a complex series of steps requiring multiple viral-host interactions. During HIV assembly, Gag utilizes cellular machineries within the host cell, such as the endosomal sorting pathway to facilitate viral assembly and release, the requirement for which is conserved within the retrovirus family {{as well as many}} other enveloped virus families. The HIV Gag polyprotein, which encodes the major structural components of the virus, also interacts with a second <b>viral</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>protein,</b> GagPol, which encodes the viral enzymes and is responsible for the targeting of these proteins to the site of virion assembly via interactions with specific lipids within the plasma membrane. The interaction between Gag and GagPol also functions to facilitate the selection and packaging of viral genomic RNA and primer tRNAs, where Gag has the capacity to identify these specific RNA species from a large background population of cytoplasmic host cell RNAs, non-genomic spliced viral RNAs, and hundreds of other tRNA species. HIV assembly and budding are believed to take place at specific microdomains within the plasma membrane which are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. This results in virion particles with a unique lipid membrane composition which is critical for HIV infectivity. The overall objective of this chapter is to discuss how these various virion-associated components and their interactions coordinate the assembly, release, and propagation of HIV.

Previous studies have mapped a protease-coding region and six cleavage sites in <b>viral</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins.</b> However, how the FCV protease interacts with its substrates remains unknown. To gain {{insights into the}} interactions, we constructed a molecular model of the FCV protease bound with the octapeptide containing a cleavage site of the capsid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> by homology modeling and docking simulation. The complex model was used to screen for the substrate mimic from a chemical library by pharmacophore-based in silico screening. With this structure-based approach, we identified a compound that has physicochemical features and arrangement of the P 3 and P 4 sites of the substrate in the protease, is predicted to bind to FCV proteases in a mode {{similar to that of}} the authentic substrate, and has the ability to inhibit viral protease activity in vitro and in the cells, and to suppress viral replication in FCV-infected cells. The complex model was further subjected to molecular dynamics simulation to refine the enzyme-substrate interactions in solution. The simulation along with a variation study predicted that the authentic substrate and anti-FCV compound share a highly conserved binding site.

My project has been to study the mechanism involved in this process. This was done by transfecting COS- 7 cells with wild type and mutant HIV- 1 proviral DNA, and analyzing {{the effects of these}} mutations on this process. In the wild type virus, 60 % of viral low molecular weight RNA is tRNA$ rm sp{Lys},$ compared to 6 % of the tRNA in the cytoplasm, i. e, the packaging of tRNA$ rm sp{Lys}$ is selective.

Mutations which either remove the 5 $ sp prime$ portion of the RNA genome, including the primer binding site, or which reduce genomic RNA incorporation approximately 10 fold, have no effect upon select tRNA$ rm sp{Lys}$ incorporation, indicating that genomic RNA does not play a role in this process. On the other hand, a large deletion of RT sequences in Pr 160 $ rm sp{gag-pol}$ reduces tRNA$ rm sp{Lys 3 }$ incorporation to approximately 1 molecule/virion, i. e, inhibits select packaging of tRNA$ rm sp{Lys}. $ Initial evidence implicating Pr 160 $ rm sp{gag-pol}$ as being the <b>viral</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> carrying tRNA$ rm sp{Lys}$ into the virus is as follows: (1) Viral particles composed only of Pr 55 $ rm sp{gag}$ do not selectively package tRNA$ rm sp{Lys},$ while viral particles composed of both Pr 55 $ rm sp{gag}$ and Pr 160 $ rm sp{gag-pol}$ do.

40|$|Transcription {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) depends on {{the function of the}} virus-encoded regulatory protein Tat, which interacts with the specific Tat response (TAR) element present in the leader sequence of all HIV- 1 RNAs. In this study, we examined whether tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) can replace the requirement for a functional Tat protein. We found that TNF-alpha can induce expression of a latent, tat-defective virus and support its replication both in T cells and in primary mononuclear cells. Analysis of the transcriptional rate of the tat-defective HIV- 1 transcriptional unit indicates that TNF-alpha stimulates the initiation of transcription but, in contrast to Tat protein, does not significantly reduce transcriptional polarity. Interestingly, we found that the processing of <b>viral</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> is altered in the absence of Tat.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{interferon}} on the biochemical properties and the maturation process of intracellular viral particles {{isolated from the}} cytoplasmic fraction of NIH/ 3 T 3 cells chronically infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus was investigated. By labeling these virions with either [35 S]methionine or [3 H]glucosamine, we demonstrated that they contain the same viral proteins and glycoproteins found in extracellular virions. Interferon treatment was found to reduce the rate of intracellular virus assembly. This effect was not a consequence of an interferon inhibition of viral RNA synthesis or its translation or a consequence of an interference with the posttranslational cleavage processing of <b>viral</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins,</b> since all of these steps were not affected by interferon. However, the reduced rate of virus assembly {{could be attributed to}} the inhibition of viral protein glycosylation observed in interferon-treated cells.

40|$|The {{invasion}} {{strategy of}} many viruses involves {{the synthesis of}} viral gene products that mimic {{the functions of the}} cellular proteins and thus interfere with the key cellular processes. Here we show that adenovirus infection is accompanied by an increased ubiquitin-cleaving (deubiquitinating) activity in the host cells. Affinity chromatography on ubiquitin aldehyde (Ubal), which was designed to identify the deubiquitinating proteases, revealed the presence of adenovirus L 3 23 K proteinase (Avp) in the eluate from adenovirus-infected cells. This proteinase is known to be necessary for the processing of <b>viral</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> during virion maturation. We show here that in vivo Avp deubiquitinates a number of cellular proteins. Analysis of the substrate specificity of Avp in vitro demonstrated that the protein deubiquitination by this enzyme could be as efficient as proteolytic processing of viral proteins. The structural model of the Ubal-Avp interaction revealed some similarity between S 1 -S 4 substrate binding sites of Avp and ubiquitin hydrolases. These results may reflect the acquisition of an advantageous property by adenovirus and may indicate the importance of ubiquitin pathways in viral infection...|$|R

Cerulenin is a naturally occurring antibiotic, commonly used as an inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis. Cerulenin has been observed to inhibit production of Rous sarcoma virus and murine leukaemia virus by infected cells, possibly by interfering with proteolytic processing of <b>viral</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins.</b> We show here that cerulenin inhibits the action of the HIV- 1 proteinase in vitro, using 3 substrates: a synthetic heptapeptide (SQNYPIV) which corresponds to the sequence at the HIV- 1 gagp 17 p 24 junction, a bacterially expressed gag precursor, and purified 66 kDa reverse transcriptase. Inhibition of cleavage by HIV- 1 proteinase required preincubation with cerulenin. Cerulenin also inactivates endothiapepsin, a well-characterised fungal aspartyl proteinase, suggesting that the action of cerulenin is a function of the common active site structure of the retroviral and aspartic proteinases. Molecular modelling suggests that cerulenin possesses several of the necessary structural features of an inhibitor of aspartyl proteinases and retroviral proteinases. Although cerulenin itself is cytotoxic and inappropriate for clinical use, it may provide leads for the rational design of inhibitors of the HIV proteinase which could have application in the chemotherapy of AIDS...|$|R

The presence of this peptide only in <b>viral</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> containing the so-called leader (L) sequence strongly suggests that gPr 45 gag is an N-terminal fragment of larger glycosylated gag polyproteins, composed of L sequences in addition to p 15 and p 12.

In contrast, our results suggest that vpu is not glycosylated, even though the protein contains a potential glycosylation site. In vitro translation studies demonstrated that vpu is cotranslationally integrated into microsomal membranes, suggesting that vpu is an integral membrane protein. While vpu was found in significant quantities in virus-producing cells, the protein could not be detected in cell-free culture fluids and is therefore most likely not viron associated. Processing of <b>viral</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> was unaffected by the absence of vpu, and no differences were detected in the protein compositions of wild-type and mutant virions.

Analysis of the proteolytic activity in a crude system using <b>viral</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins,</b> as well as in a purified system with activated proteinases using a new chromophoric octapeptide substrate, yielded results consistent with Cys- 104 and His- 54 being two members of the active site.

Although Cys- 122 and Cys- 126 were also reactive cysteines, mutation of these residues did not affect enzyme activity. Replacement of the active-site Cys- 104 by serine converted the enzyme into a serine-like proteinase, sensitive to serine proteinase inhibitors. The absence of homology to other proteinases, particularly at the active-site cysteine, coupled with the requirement for activation by a substrate cleavage fragment, indicates that the adenovirus endoproteinase may represent a new subclass of cysteine proteinases...|$|R

Proof-of-principle studies indicate that BMS- 232632 blocks the cleavage of <b>viral</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> in HIV-infected cells, proving that it functions as an HIV Prt inhibitor. Comparative studies showed that BMS- 232632 is generally more potent than the five currently approved HIV- 1 Prt inhibitors. Furthermore, BMS- 232632 is highly selective for HIV- 1 Prt and exhibits cytotoxicity only at concentrations 6, 500 - to 23, 000 -fold higher than that required for anti-HIV activity. To assess the potential of this inhibitor when used {{in combination with other}} antiretrovirals, BMS- 232632 was evaluated for anti-HIV activity in two-drug combination studies.

Previous studies have shown that TBP is targeted by the poliovirus (PV) -encoded protease 3 Cpro to bring about shutoff of cellular RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription in PV-infected cells. The processing of the majority of <b>viral</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> by 3 Cpro involves cleavages at glutamine-glycine (Q-G) sites. We present evidence that suggests that the transcriptional inactivation of TBP by 3 Cpro involves cleavage at the glutamine 104 -serine 105 (Q 104 -S 105) site of TBP and not at the Q 18 -G 19 site as previously thought. The TBP Q 104 -S 105 cleavage by 3 Cpro is greatly influenced by the presence of an aliphatic amino acid at the P 4 position, a hallmark of 3 Cpro-mediated proteolysis. To examine the importance of host cell transcription shutoff in the PV life cycle, stable HeLa cell lines were created that express recombinant TBP resistant to cleavage by the viral proteases, called GG rTBP. Transcription shutoff was significantly impaired and delayed in GG rTBP cells upon infection with poliovirus compared with the cells that express wild-type recombinant TBP (wt rTBP). Infection of GG rTBP cells with poliovirus resulted in small plaques, significantly reduced viral RNA synthesis, and lower viral yields compared to the wt rTBP cell line.

Despite its importance, the molecular mechanism of nodaviral sgRNA 3 synthesis is still poorly understood. Here, we propose that sgRNA 3 of Wuhan nodavirus (WhNV) is internally initiated from a promoter on the negative template of genomic RNA 1. Serial deletion and mutation analyses further revealed that the core promoter of WhNV sgRNA 3 is between nucleotide positions − 22 and + 6 of its transcription start site. Besides, a stem-loop structure of WhNV sgRNA 3 was computationally predicted upstream of sgRNA 3 's transcription start site. Both the secondary structure and the primary sequence were determined to be required for promoter activity. Furthermore, our results show that the synthesis of WhNV sgRNA 3 is counterregulated by the replication of WhNV genomic RNA 2, which encodes a <b>viral</b> capsid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein.</b> And this sgRNA 3 synthesis is also able to trans-activate the replication of RNA 2.

The 20 N-terminal amino acid residues of histone H 3 are specifically cleaved off early during infection. Truncated histone H 3 remains chromatin associated. In addition, we showed that the histone H 3 -Pi transition is catalyzed by the FMDV 3 C protease.

We have reported (i) that activation of the Nrf 2 tran-scription factor and upregulation of antioxidative defenses occurs in astrocytes infected with ts 1 in vitro and (ii) that some ts 1 -infected astrocytes survive infection by mobilization of these pathways. Here, we show that treatment with a refined monosodium -luminol (Galavit; GVT) suppresses oxidative stress and Nrf 2 activa-tion in cultured ts 1 -infected astrocytes. GVT treatment also inhibits the development of spongiform enceph-alopathy and gliosis in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) in ts 1 -infected mice, preserves normal cytoarchitec-ture in the thymus, and delays paralysis, thymic atrophy, wasting, and death. GVT treatment of infected mice reduces ts 1 -induced oxidative stress, cell death, and pathogenesis in both the CNS and thymus of treate...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) requires the sequential activities of virus-encoded proteins during replication. The activities of several host cell proteins and machineries are also {{critical to the}} completion of virus assembly {{and the release of}} infectious virus particles from cells. One of these proteins, the double-stranded RNA-binding protein Staufen 1 (Stau 1), selectively associates with the HIV- 1 genomic RNA and the <b>viral</b> <b>precursor</b> Gag <b>protein,</b> pr 55 Gag. In this report, we tested whether Stau 1 modulates pr 55 Gag assembly using a new and specific pr 55 Gag oligomerization assay based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) in both live cells and extracts after cell fractionation. Our results show that both the overexpression and knockdown of Stau 1 increase the pr 55 Gag-pr 55 Gag BRET levels, suggesting a role for Stau 1 in regulating pr 55 Gag oligomerization during assembly. This effect of Stau 1 on pr 55 Gag oligomerization was observed only in membranes, a cellular compartment in which pr 55 Gag assembly primarily occurs. Consistently, expression of Stau 1 harboring a vSrc myristylation signal led to a 6. 5 -fold enrichment of Stau 1 in membranes and a corresponding enhancement in the Stau 1 -mediated effect on pr 55 Gag-pr 55 Gag BRET, demonstrating that Stau 1 acts on assembly when targeted to membranes. A role for Stau 1 in the formation of particles is further supported by the detection of membrane-associated detergent-resistant pr 55 Gag complexes and the increase of virus-like particle release when Stau 1 expression levels are modulated. Our results indicate that Stau 1 influences HIV- 1 assembly by modulating pr 55 Gag-pr 55 Gag interactions, as shown in a live cell interaction assay. This likely occurs when Stau 1 interacts with membrane-associated assembly intermediates...|$|R
40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type- 1 matrix (HIV- 1 MA) is best described as a multi-functional, structural protein. However, the multitude of functional activities ascribed to this viral component {{is not nearly as}} interesting as are its seemingly paradoxical and opposing roles during the viral life cycle. At the time of virus infection, HIV- 1 MA remains associated with the reverse transcription complex, in which viral nucleic acids are synthesized, and facilitates its translocation to the host cell nucleus (Bukrinsky, Sharova et al. 1992; Bukrinsky, Sharova et al. 1993). This activity of MA has been proposed to form the basis for the infection of non-dividing cells (Bukrinsky, Haggerty et al. 1993). An interaction between the C-terminally phosphorylated form of MA and HIV- 1 integrase, an integral component of the complex, was initially proposed to mediate this association (Gallay, Swingler et al. 1995; Gallay, Swingler et al. 1995). However, conditions which promote dissociation of integrase from the reverse transcription complex do not reduce MA association (Miller, Farnet et al. 1997). The possibility of a direct interaction between MA and the viral genome is discussed in Chapter III. The nucleophilic nature of HIV- 1 MA is paradoxical with its reported activity in targeting the <b>viral</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> to the cytoplasmic membrane (Krausslich and Welker 1996), during the particle production phase of the viral life cycle. Furthermore, MA when expressed in the absence of other viral proteins exhibits a cytoplasmic localization (Fouchier, Meyer et al. 1997); a result which does not support a nuclear translocation role for this protein. The work presented here resolves this seemingly controversial issue. We demonstrate that MA exhibits a strong nuclear export activity. This newly discovered activity is designed to effectively counteract the protein 2 ̆ 7 s innate nucleophilic nature, thus maintaining a cytoplasmic localization. The nuclear export function of MA is sensitive to changes within the conformation of the protein as C- and N-terminal deletions, as well as point mutations in the protein, abolish the activity. Furthermore, the export activity is mediated by the Crm 1 NES receptor (Fornerod, Ohno et al. 1997; Fukuda, Asano et al. 1997; Ossareh-Nazari, Bachelerie et al. 1997) despite the lack of a leucine-rich export signal within the matrix coding region. Therefore, the interaction between matrix protein and Crm 1 is most likely to be mediated by another, perhaps cellular, protein. Any changes in matrix structure may lead to the disruption of this protein-protein interaction. We discuss a model implicating a phosphorylation event in the inactivation of this nuclear export signal. An even more fascinating issue regards the role of this nuclear export activity, during the viral life cycle, and is detailed in Chapter II. In short, mutations in MA which impair its nuclear export activity result in nuclear accumulation of the precursor Gag polyprotein (Pr 55) and the nucleocapsid-associated viral genomic RNA. As a result, non-infectious virions deficient in genomic viral RNA are produced. Therefore, drugs designed to block this export activity can undermine the carefully orchestrated course of events during HIV replication and can shut down the growth of the virus...|$|R
40|$|The β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> is the <b>precursor</b> of {{the main}} {{component}} of senile plaques (the β-amyloid peptide or β/A 4) found in the brain of aged humans and, in higher amounts, in the brain of Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome subjects. Four different forms of β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> messenger RNAs have been described in humans and rodents: β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> 695, β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> 714, β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> 751 and β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> 770 messenger RNAs (numbers corresponding to the number of encoded amino acids). The two latter forms are characterized by containing in their sequence a region with high homology to the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. We have used oligonucleotide probes to study the distribution of the different messenger RNAs encoding each of the four β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins</b> by in situ hybridization histochemistry in human, rat and mouse brain. We found that β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> 695, β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> 714 and β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> 751 messenger RNAs were widely distributed in the human, rat and mouse brain and that their distribution was roughly similar in most brain areas in these three species. The distribution of β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> 770 messenger RNA was not so wide and differed among the three species studied. β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> 751 and 770 messenger RNAs were the only forms present at significant levels in rodent choroid plexus and meninges, while β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> messenger RNA isoforms containing and lacking the Kunitz domain were detected in the human choroid plexus. We also observed that the relative levels of β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> 751 and 770 messenger RNAs in the rat cerebral white matter {{as well as in the}} mouse and human striatum were higher than those of the β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> messenger RNAs lacking the Kunitz domain. While the most abundant β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> messenger RNAs in the brain of all three species under study were, in descending order, β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> 695 and β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> 751 messenger RNAs, the least abundant form was not the same for all species: in human it was β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> 714 messenger RNA and in rat and mouse brain it was β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> 770 messenger RNA. Our results show differences both inter- and intraspecies of the relative abundance and distribution of four β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> messenger RNAs in rat, mouse and human brain. The non-coincidence of the distribution of β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> messenger RNA isoforms suggests different physiological functions for the β-amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>proteins.</b> Interspecies differences should be considered when comparing results from animal and human studies.

40|$|We {{developed}} an {{in vitro translation}} extract from Krebs- 2 cells that translates the entire open reading frame of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) strain H 77 and properly processes the <b>viral</b> <b>protein</b> <b>precursors</b> when supplemented with canine microsomal membranes (CMMs). Translation of the C-terminal portion of the viral polyprotein in this system is documented by the synthesis of NS 5 B. Evidence for posttranslational modification of the viral proteins, the N-terminal glycosylation of E 1 and the E 2 precursor (E 2 -p 7), and phosphorylation of NS 5 A is presented. With the exception of NS 3, efficient generation of all virus-specific proteins is CMM dependent. A time course of the appearance of HCV products indicates that the viral polyprotein is cleaved cotranslationally. A competitive inhibitor of the NS 3 protease inhibited accumulation of NS 3, NS 4 B, NS 5 A, and NS 5 B, but not that of NS 2 or structural proteins. CMMs also stabilized HCV mRNA during translation. Finally, the formyl-[35 S]methionyl moiety of the initiator tRNAMet was incorporated exclusively into the core protein portion of the polyprotein, demonstrating that translation initiation in this system occurs with high fidelity...|$|R
40|$|Dysregulation of the {{proteolytic}} {{processing of}} amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> by c-secretase {{and the ensuing}} generation of amyloid-b {{is associated with the}} pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, the identification of amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> binding proteins involved in regulating processing of amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> by the c-secretase complex is essential for understanding the mechanisms underlying the molecular pathology of the disease. We identified calreticulin as novel amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> interaction partner that binds to the c-secretase cleavage site within amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> and showed that this Ca 2 +- and N-glycan-independent interaction is mediated by amino acids 330 – 344 in the C-terminal C-domain of calreticulin. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that calreticulin is not only associated with amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> but also with the c-secretase complex members presenilin and nicastrin. Calreticulin was detected at the cell surface by surface biotinylation of cells overexpressing amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> and was co-localized by immunostaining with amyloid <b>precursor</b> <b>protein</b> and presenilin at the cell surface of hippocampal neurons. The P-domain of calreticulin located between the N-terminal N-domain and the C-domain interacts with presenilin, the catalytic subunit of the c-secretase complex. The P- and C-domains also interact with nicastrin, another functionally important subunit of this complex.
