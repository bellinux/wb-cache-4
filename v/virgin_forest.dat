5|$|An {{hour after}} the {{previous}} event caused destruction in Upstate New York, a new tornado family began producing significant damage in the adjacent state of Connecticut. The first tornado, {{which may have been}} three separate tornadoes, started its path of destruction in Cornwall, leveling a <b>virgin</b> <b>forest</b> known as Cathedral Pines. At the nearby Mohawk Mountain Ski Area, every ski lift was destroyed, with some lift chairs found miles away. The tornado continued south-southeast through Milton, leveling hundreds more trees, and destroyed the village of Bantam before dissipating. Strong downburst winds continued to cause damage and level trees after this tornado lifted: it was during this period between tornadoes that a 12-year-old girl was killed by falling trees in Black Rock State Park.|$|E
5|$|As more <b>virgin</b> <b>forest</b> {{was lost}} to tavy, {{communities}} increasingly planted and cultivated permanent plots of land. By 600CE, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and begun clearing the forests of the central highlands. Rice was originally dry planted or cultivated in marshy lowland areas, which produced low yields. Irrigated rice paddies were adopted in the highlands around 1600, first in Betsileo country in the southern highlands, then later in the northern highlands of Imerina. By the time terraced paddies emerged in central Madagascar over the next century, the area's original forest cover had largely vanished. In its place were scattered villages ringed with nearby rice paddies and crop fields a day's walk away, surrounded by vast plains of sterile grasses.|$|E
5|$|Housing {{and social}} {{organization}} among the Mikea {{can vary from}} one individual or community to the next. Some Mikea remain in the forest their entire lives, while others live {{part of their lives}} in villages or towns. While living in the forest, groups of Mikea typically move seasonally between encampments nearest to critical resources. In the rainy season, they often live in groups of 30-50 people near tracts of <b>virgin</b> <b>forest</b> in proximity to their newly cleared and planted corn fields. The houses in this settlement are square with peaked roofs, as elsewhere in Madagascar, and are typically made of thatch and bark on a wooden pole frame. These houses are loosely clustered with generous space between each lodging. The rainy season encampment serves for three to five years as a base for forest foraging before resource depletion requires a move to a new location. Those working the corn fields may live in simple grass shelters alongside their crops until April or May, when they return to the bark houses. During the dry season from May to October, the encampment splits into smaller groups that relocate deeper into the forest to settle near babo tuber patches, with dwellings limited to brush shelters and thatch sunshades, and some individuals not living in shelters at all. In both types of settlements furniture is nearly non-existent and Mikea typically sleep in the sand or pits dug at the base of giant termite mounds.|$|E
40|$|What makes <b>virgin</b> <b>forests</b> better forests? Biodiversity {{evaluation}} {{depends on}} the value systems of the stakeholders involved. Indicators for conservation value, ecosystem functions, wilderness, uniqueness, or species richness may not correlate, or even correlate negatively. Based on arthropod data from a comparative study in two types of <b>virgin</b> <b>forests</b> in core areas of the Carpathian Biosphere Reserve in Ukraine and managed forests in Switzerland with matching tree species composition, several biodiversity aspects and their underlying value systems are presented and discussed. There {{were no significant differences}} in species richness between <b>virgin</b> and managed <b>forests.</b> Most arthropod groups tended to be more divers in managed forests, while saproxylic beetles, and fungi, millipedes and molluscs were more divers in <b>virgin</b> <b>forests.</b> The most obvious assets of <b>virgin</b> <b>forests</b> in terms of biodiversity values are wilderness and uniqueness. The conservation value, focussing on rare and threatened species, seems to be of lesser importance in Central European <b>virgin</b> <b>forests.</b> Other values of forest biodiversity such as species richness and ecosystem functions are unsuitable for valorising <b>virgin</b> <b>forests</b> in comparison to managed forests...|$|R

25|$|Until 1800 {{the region}} of São Pedro and its enclave was <b>virgin</b> <b>forest.</b> The first civilized people to set foot in Águas de São Pedro {{territory}} were, as in most municipalities in the São Paulo countryside, bandeirantes seeking precious stones, especially gold, opening many roads and routes in the dense forest. One of these routes, called Caminho do Picadão (Way of the Forest Trail), started in Itu, passed through Piracicaba and advanced towards the hinterlands of Araraquara. For years, many farms were established in the region, until in 1883, São Pedro was detached from Piracicaba and became politically independent.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} poverty of many cocoa farmers means that environmental consequences such as deforestation are given little significance. For decades, cocoa farmers have encroached on <b>virgin</b> <b>forest,</b> mostly after the felling of trees by logging companies. This trend has decreased as many governments and communities {{are beginning to}} protect their remaining forested zones. In general, the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides by cocoa farmers is limited. When cocoa bean prices are high, farmers may invest in their crops, leading to higher yields which, in turn tends to result in lower market prices and a renewed period of lower investment.|$|E

25|$|Soon after Dinesen {{arrived in}} Kenya, {{which at the}} time was part of British East Africa, she and Blixen married in Mombasa on January 14, 1914. After her marriage, she was known as Baroness Blixen, and used the title until 1929, when her ex-husband remarried. Initially, they planned to raise cattle on their farm, but were {{convinced}} that coffee would be more profitable. The Karen Coffee Company was established by Aage Westerholz, who chose the name after his daughter Karen, Blixen's cousin, rather than to create an association with Karen Blixen. The couple soon established their first farm, M'Bagathi, in the Great Lakes area, but quickly ran into difficulties caused by the outbreak of the First World War. Fighting between the Germans and the British in East Africa led to a shortage of workers and supplies. Nevertheless, in 1916, the Karen Coffee Company purchased a larger farm, M'Bogani, near the Ngong Hills to the north of Nairobi. It covered 6,000 acres of land, of which 600 were used for a coffee plantation. The remainder were used by the natives for grazing while 2,000 acres of <b>virgin</b> <b>forest</b> were left untouched.|$|E
