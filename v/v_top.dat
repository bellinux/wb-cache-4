40|$|International audienceSurface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) on {{a curved}} metal-dielectric {{interface}} are shown {{to experience a}} geometric potential <b>V</b> <b>top</b> like quantum particles confined on a curved surface. As opposed to electrons or photons constrained by a squeezing potential, no ambiguities arise {{in the definition of}} the geometric potential for SPPs. A general form of <b>V</b> <b>top</b> for SPPs on a generalized cylindrical surface is derived by a multiple-scale asymptotic analysis of vectorial Maxwell's equations for the case of a curvature radius larger than the SPP wavelength. G Della Valle et al., Geometric potential for plasmon polaritons on curved surfaces [...] . 2 Geometry {{plays a major role in}} defining the dynamical properties of quantum particles and classical waves confined on a curved space [1, 2]. For instance, it is well known that surface geometry influences the motion of a quantum particle constrained on a curved surface [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], like electrons in low-dimensional nanostructures [10, 11, 12]. A similar behavior occurs for optical waves squeezed on a curved thin dielectric guiding layer [13]. As in the 'classical ' (e. g. newtonian or ray-optics) limits the motion is ruled by the surface metric and the force-free trajectories are geodesics, in the full wave regime an additional frictional potential <b>V</b> <b>top,</b> referred to as the geometric potential, is found [3, 4, 5, 6]. Though <b>V</b> <b>top</b> vanishes in the classical limit (as it should), its dependence on the surface topology has been a matter of great controversies which have been especially discussed in the quantum mechanical context [4, 7, 8, 9]. An accepted approach, originally proposed by Jensen, Koppe and da Costa [5, 6], is to squeeze the quantum particle on the surface by a physical confining potential. This approach has been recently adopted for confined optical waves as well [13]. Even in this case some ambiguities remain due to the freedom in selecting the squeezing potential [9]. Such difficulties cast a shadow over the physical relevance of any geometric potential for three-dimensional particles or waves constrained on a surface, because the way they sense the surrounding space strongly depends on the squeezing potential. Some authors also argued that ideal squeezing procedures generally correspond to unrealistic restrictions [7]. In this Letter we show that a geometric potential, which does not suffer from any ambiguity, does exist at a curved metal-dielectric interface for surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), i. e. for coupled modes of plasmons and photons. As compared to electrons or photons squeezed on a surface, SPPs are intrinsically two-dimensional quasi particles and do not require any squeezing potential. SPPs have attracted special attention in recent years for their relevance in subwavelength optics and nanophotonics [14, 15]. In spite of the considerable efforts devoted to study SPPs in different curved geometries [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], including SPPs scattering and radiation at bends or interfaces [22, 23, 24, 25], the concept and properties of a geometric potential for SPPs has been overlooked. Here we consider SPPs on a generalized cylindrical surface [Fig. 1 (a) ] and derive, by a multiple scale asymptotic analysis of full vectorial Maxwell's equations, a general form of <b>V</b> <b>top.</b> The predictions of the asymptotic analysis, such as the appearance of bound states sustained by the geometric potential, are confirmed by full-vectorial numerical simulations in curved Ag-glass interfaces. Let us consider SPPs at optical frequency ω = 2 πc 0 /λ on a curved metal-dielectric interface defined by a generalized cylindrical surface and let us introduce a set of local curvilinear coordinates (σ, η, z) around the surface, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). If we normalize the spatial variables to the reduced wavelength λ = λ/(2 π) = 1 /k and indicate by u = (c 0 B σ, E η, E z) and v = (E σ, c 0 B η, c 0 B z) the mixed components of electric E and magnetic B fields, Maxwell's equations in the curvilinear coordinate system can be cast in the followin...|$|E

30|$|Establishing {{hydrocarbon}} {{plays in}} a basin involves ascertaining the presence and functionality of play requirements. These include an active charge system (source rocks and migration pathways), porous and permeable reservoir rocks, and regional top seal and trapping system. These faults are also possible conduits for the passage of generated hydrocarbons into the traps. Potential plays in the onshore West Baram Delta are believed to essentially be the Lower-to-Upper Miocene Cycles III and <b>V</b> <b>top</b> set sands and low fan deposits in possibly combination (structural and stratigraphic) traps or stratigraphic traps alone (Tan and Lamy 1990; Jong et al. 2017 a, b). Principal hydrocarbon plays in the Tinjar Province include the Oligo–Miocene (Cycles I/II) clastic plays, Oligo–Miocene limestone plays in the northern hemisphere and the easterly oriented Lambir Formation (Ismail and Abu Hassan 1999). The Oligocene–Lower Miocene Cycles I/II clastic (the Nyalau Formation) of the essentially onshore Tinjar province {{are believed to be}} important hydrocarbon reservoir plays in the province, while the Cycles III/IV clastics of Lambir are secondary reservoir plays. The intercalated shales within these clastic materials hold potential for dual roles, first as source rocks to charge overlying reservoir sands, and also as reservoir seal. Apart from the onshore Baram Delta, the Balingian onshore is the most explored province in the onshore Sarawak Basin. At least 18 boreholes (dominantly concentrated in the SW Balingian subprovince) have penetrated its subprovinces to test possible hydrocarbon plays (Table  1). Although several discoveries in form of shows were made, the interplay of economics and estimated STOIIP seem to have hampered their development, as Madon and Abolins (1999) had reliably reported that none of the discoveries was developed.|$|E

A new tensorial notation is developed to present the various constructs of noncommutative geometry. In particular, this notation is used to determine the spectral data of the standard model. The particle spectrum with all of its symmetries is derived, almost uniquely, under the assumption of irreducibility and of dimension 6 modulo 8 for the finite space. The reduction from the natural symmetry group SU(2) xSU(2) xSU(4) to U(1) xSU(2) xSU(3) is a consequence of {{the hypothesis that}} the two layers of space-time are finite distance apart but is non-dynamical. The square of the Dirac operator, and all geometrical invariants that appear in the calculation of the heat kernel expansion are evaluated. We re-derive the leading order terms in the spectral action. The geometrical action yields unification of all fundamental interactions including gravity at very high energies. We make the following predictions: (i) The number of fermions per family is 16. (ii) The symmetry group is U(1) xSU(2) xSU(3). (iii) There are quarks and leptons in the correct representations. (iv) There is a doublet Higgs that breaks the electroweak symmetry to U(1). (<b>v)</b> <b>Top</b> quark mass of 170 - 175 Gev. (v) There is a right-handed neutrino with a see-saw mechanism.

We prepare the ground for computing higher order corrections since the predicted mass of the Higgs field is quite sensitive to the higher order corrections.

ScienceDirect® is a {{registered}} trademark of Elsevier B. <b>V.</b> <b>Top</b> predators {{have been described as}} highly interactive keystone species. Their decline has been linked to secondary extinctions and their increase has been linked to ecological restoration. Several authors have recently argued that the dingo Canis lupus dingo is another example of a top predator that maintains mesopredators and generalist herbivores at low and stable numbers, thereby increasing biodiversity and productivity. Due to the sensitivity of many Australian species to introduced mesopredators and herbivores, the top predator hypothesis predicts that threatened species will not survive where dingoes are rare or absent. However, several threatened species have survived inside the Dingo Barrier Fence (DBF). We present a new view on the survival of the yellow-footed rock-wallaby Petrogale xanthopus xanthopus and the malleefowl Leipoa ocellata inside the DBF where the dingo is considered very rare, or in areas where the dingo {{is believed to have been}} eradicated several decades ago. We found that dingoes co-occurred with both threatened species. Dingoes were present at all wallaby colonies surveyed and occurred throughout their range. The most common predator detected in areas inhabited by the wallabies was in fact the dingo, and we found no significant difference between dingo abundance inside compared to outside the DBF. Malleefowl nests were found to be scent marked by dingoes at the three sites that we surveyed, despite these sites being close to human settlement and sheep farms, and in small and fragmented patches of wilderness. These findings provide further evidence for an association between the presence of dingoes and the survival of threatened species, which is in agreement with the top predator hypothesis. The results of this study challenges the current assumption that the presence and ecological consequence of dingoes in sheep country are negligible and we suggest that wildlife managers verify whether dingoes are present before predator control is initiated.

40|$|Avian frugivores across Southeast Asia, {{and in the}} Philippines in particular, {{are seriously}} {{threatened}} owing to massive loss of habitat and direct exploitation through hunting and the pet trade. Their declines may have dire consequences for wider ecological processes as many frugivores are also seed dispersers. Conservation programmes in the Philippines are crippled {{by a lack of}} knowledge on the status, abundance and ecology of frugivores which extend to other endemic species in the country. This PhD identified factors that influenced frugivore community composition as well as drivers of frugivore distribution across Luzon, the largest island in the Philippines. It also developed cost-effective methods for gathering baseline ecological data to inform conservation measures for frugivores and other little-known species over large geographical areas. This included a way of correcting for the bias caused by non-random transect placement in a study site which is often the case during bird surveys in the tropics. Twenty-five species of pigeons, parrots and hornbills were surveyed using distance sampling along nearly 500 km of line transects at 14 sites across the island of Luzon. I documented surprisingly few reliable disappearances of frugivores from individual forest patches – in fact this and other fieldwork since 2000 has increased the known extent of occurrence of several species. However, green racquet-tail Prioniturus luconensis may have suffered a real range contraction. More alarming was the absence of large parrots from most sites with apparently intact habitat surveyed. Even where present, large parrots exhibited lower densities than related species in similar habitat in Southeast Asia. For six species, including four of six parrots, the largest estimates of population in any reserve in Luzon numbered 100 cm) as compared with random paths (especially cut transects). Path types were similar in altitude, but differed in terms of tree girths, slope, canopy covers, and presence of crops. Hunter trails yielded lowest densities and encounter rates for nine of 12 species and lowest effective strip width for seven of 12 species. Highest densities and encounter rates were along random paths for seven of 12 species. Differences in density across trail types were driven by differences in encounter rates rather than differences in detectability. Density estimates calculated from surveys which used non-random transects should be upwardly corrected by on average 90 % (18 - 187 %). In fragmented forests where random placement of transects is not always possible, this method of correction will allow species density estimates from sampling along hunter trails and access roads to be adjusted. <b>v</b> <b>Top</b> on the list of research and conservation priorities arising from this PhD would be to map the remaining populations of the Luzon-endemic Green Racquet-tail, Luzon Racquet-tail and Flame-breasted Fruit-dove and to formulate conservation intervention measures for these threatened/near-threatened species taking into account habitat preferences and threats to the species. Forest and reserve management programmes and policies in the Philippines and elsewhere in the tropics would greatly benefit from empirical data on species occurrence and accurate estimates of population abundance using methods described in the study. Sound ecological research by local biologists/ecologists must be encouraged to further our understanding of species requirements, species tolerance to disturbance, and viability of populations, especially of the many unique and/or threatened species in the Philippines and the wider SE Asia region.
