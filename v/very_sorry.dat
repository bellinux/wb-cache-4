[...] This meant he was easily persuaded to sign official statements, including a denunciation of Andrei Sakharov in 1973; {{on the other hand}} he was willing to try to help constituents in his capacities as chairman of the Composers' Union and Deputy to the Supreme Soviet. Oleg Prokofiev commented that [...] "he tried to help so many people that... less and less attention was paid to his pleas."

500|$|Unlike his superior, Reinhard Scheer, Hipper {{never wrote}} {{a memoir of}} the war or his {{participation}} in the Imperial Navy. He briefly dabbled in conservative political movements in the 1920s but never committed to any. Franz von Hipper died on 25 May 1932; he was cremated and was buried {{in his hometown of}} Weilheim, according to his wishes. On hearing of Hipper's death, his old adversary David Beatty said, [...] "I am <b>very</b> <b>sorry.</b> One would like to express one's regrets for the passing of a gallant officer and a great sailor."

[...] Churchill wrote an anti-Jellicoe tract in his World Crisis, Volume III which in large measure shared Dewar's views on tactics and even some diagrams. [...] Although Dewar would later become a supporter of the Labour Party, after Churchill was passed over for a cabinet position in 1931 Dewar wrote to him on 16 November, [...] "I am <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> to see that you are not in the new Cabinet.

The Marquis de Gruignan attempted a counter-attack, but he was easily brushed aside by the triumphant Allies. After a final rally behind his camp's tents, shouting entreaties to stand and fight, Marshal Tallard was caught up in the rout and pushed towards Sonderheim. Surrounded by a squadron of Hessian troops, Tallard surrendered to Lieutenant-Colonel de Boinenburg, the Prince of Hesse-Kassel's aide-de-camp, and was sent under escort to Marlborough. The Duke welcomed the French commander – [...] "I am <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> that such a cruel misfortune should have fallen upon a soldier for whom I have the highest regard." [...] With salutes and courtesies, the Marshal was escorted to Marlborough's coach.|$|E

I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes.

500|$|A soldier {{under the}} command of Colonel Garnons Williams wrote an account of his {{commanding}} officer's death, which puts the date of his death as 27 September. Col Garnons Williams was in temporary command of the 12th Royal Fusiliers when on 25 September he led his battalion in an attack on German trenches. However, the flanks were exposed and on 27 September, Garnons Williams gave the order to retreat. He was at that moment shot in the head from a house nearby. The soldier who gave the account said: [...] "I was <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> for him, as we could not have had a better, braver officer. He was with us {{all the time in the}} front trench, and looked after us as well as he could; no man could have done better. Nobody could get back to him." [...] The following evening, the battalion was relieved, Garnons Williams being declared officially wounded and missing in action, unofficially reported killed.|$|E

When he was {{nineteen}} months old, Octavius became an older brother with the birth of his younger brother Prince Alfred. Octavius was three years of age when Alfred died on 20 August 1782, and he again became the youngest surviving child. Horace Walpole wrote to Sir Horace Mann that upon Prince Alfred's death, King George had declared [...] "I am <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> for Alfred; but had it been Octavius, I should have died too." [...] In 1820, historian Edward Holt would write of the prince's character, [...] "Though Prince Octavius had not passed his fifth year, he was considered very docile, and possessed good-nature in such an uncommon degree, that he was the delight of all about him." [...] Biographer John Watkins added Octavius was [...] "reckoned one of the finest of the royal progeny." ...|$|E

Streep began auditioning for film roles, and underwent an unsuccessful audition for the lead role in Dino De Laurentiis's King Kong. Laurentiis stated in Italian to his son: [...] "This is so ugly. Why did you bring me this". Unknown to Laurentiis, Streep understood Italian and she remarked, [...] "I'm <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> that I'm not as beautiful as I should be but, you know—this is it. This is what you get". She continued to work on Broadway, appearing in the 1976 double bill of Tennessee Williams' 27 Wagons Full of Cotton and Arthur Miller's A Memory of Two Mondays. For the former, she received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Play. Streep's other Broadway credits include Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard and the Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill musical Happy End, in which she had originally appeared off-Broadway at the Chelsea Theater Center. She received Drama Desk Award nominations for both productions.|$|E

It did not convert any of the nominations into awards. Allen Daviau, who was nominated as cinematographer, publicly complained, [...] "I can't second-guess the Academy, but I feel <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> that I get nominations and Steven doesn't. It's his vision that makes it all come together, and if Steven wasn't making these films, {{none of us would}} be here."

The nominations included production design, costume design, and adapted screenplay. Spielberg was honored by his work from the Directors Guild of America, while the American Society of Cinematographers honored Allen Daviau.

[...] McEwen, who had taken a hard-line on his checks in 1992, relented in the campaign. Martin Gottlieb wrote, [...] "McEwen says now that his problem {{was a form of}} excessive pride.

500|$|The Hallucination version {{had only}} a basic story concept, having dropped the {{previous}} scenario penned by Noboru Sugimura of Flagship. In 2012, [...] scenario writer Yasuhisa Kawamura said {{he was responsible for}} this version, as he wanted to make Biohazard 4 scarier [...] "and suggested using a particular scene from the film Lost Souls, where the main character [...] suddenly finds herself in a derelict building with a killer on the loose. An arranged version of this idea eventually turned into Hook Man. The idea went through several iterations as Mr. Sugimura and I carefully refined this world (which, I have to say, was very romantic). Leon infiltrates the castle of Spencer seeking the truth, while inside a laboratory located deep within, a young girl wakes up. Accompanied by a B.O.W. [...] dog, the two start to make their way up the castle. Unfortunately, there were many obstacles that needed to be overcome and the cost of development was deemed too expensive." [...] Kawamura added he was <b>very</b> <b>sorry</b> and [...] "even ashamed" [...] that Mikami had to step in and scrap this version. After this attempt, the last canceled revision featured classic zombies again. However, it was discontinued after few months, and before it was ever shown to the public, as the developers felt it was too formulaic.|$|E
500|$|After {{some months}} in London, Lambert was visited by Józef Boruwłaski, a [...] dwarf then in his seventies. Born in 1739 to a poor family in rural Pokuttya, Boruwłaski was {{generally}} considered to be the last of Europe's court dwarfs. [...] He was introduced to the Empress Maria Theresa in 1754, and after a short time residing with deposed Polish king Stanisław Leszczyński, he exhibited himself around Europe, thus becoming a wealthy man. At age60, he retired to Durham, where he became such a popular figure that the City of Durham paid him to live there and he became one of its most prominent citizens. [...] Boruwłaski had a superb memory, and recalled that Lambert, while still employed by Patrick's die casting works and before he grew fat, had paid to see him in Birmingham. Boruwłaski remarked [...] "I have seen this face twenty years before at Birmingham, but certainly it be another body". He had been told that Lambert's bulk was a hoax, and he therefore felt his leg to prove to himself that it was not. The two men compared their respective outfits, and calculated that one of Lambert's sleeves would provide enough cloth to make an entire coat for Boruwłaski. Lambert enquired after Boruwłaski's wife, Isalina Barbutan, whereupon the latter replied [...] "No, she is dead, and I am not <b>very</b> <b>sorry,</b> for when I affront her, she put me on the mantle-shelf for punishment." ...|$|E
