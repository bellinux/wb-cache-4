40|$|A {{new concept}} is {{presented}} for air-to-air missile which is dynamic attack zone after being launched in random wind field. This new concept {{can be used}} to obtain the 4 -dimensional (4 -D) information regarding the <b>dynamic</b> <b>envelope</b> of an air-to-air missile at any flight time aimed at different flight targets considering influences of random wind, in the situation of flight fighters cooperated with missiles fighting against each other. Based on an air-to-air missile model, some typical cases of dynamic attack zone after being launched in random wind field were numerically simulated. Compared with the simulation results of traditional <b>dynamic</b> <b>envelope,</b> the properties of dynamic attack zone after being launched are as follows. The 4 -D dynamic attack zone after being launched is inside traditional maximum <b>dynamic</b> <b>envelope,</b> but its forane boundary is usually not inside traditional no-escape dynamic envelope; Traditional dynamic attack zone can just be reliably used at launch time, while <b>dynamic</b> <b>envelope</b> after being launched can be reliably and accurately used during any flight antagonism time. Traditional envelope is a special case of <b>dynamic</b> <b>envelope</b> after being launched when the <b>dynamic</b> <b>envelope</b> is calculated at the launch time; the <b>dynamic</b> <b>envelope</b> after being launched can be influenced by the random wind field...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of the {{calculation}} of the longitudinal location of a wheel rail contact point on the wheelset’s motion in a <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamic</b> simulation. All current <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamic</b> software programs assume that the contact between wheel and rail takes place in the vertical plane through the wheelset’s rolling axis. However, when the yaw angle of the wheelset is nonzero, the contact point is situated up to 10 ?mm from that plane. This difference causes a difference in the yaw moment on the wheelset which is used in the <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamic</b> simulation. To such an end, an existing analytical method to determine the longitudinal method was validated using a numerical approach. Then <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamic</b> simulations with both the classic and the new contact location were performed, concluding that using a more accurate contact point location results in a smaller wheelset yaw angle in a <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamic</b> simulation, although the effect is small.

The measurement of <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamic</b> parameters are costly and usually with great errors. A method is proposed in terms of the recognition of <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamic</b> parameters based on the corning kinetics and corning geometry of the vehicle.

The method is derived from the vehicle geometric kinetics and is different from the tradition method of using velocity differences between every wheel to express the yaw rate. Vehicle sideslip is taken into account, indicating that the effect of tire sideslip on vehicle kinetics is considered, thus make it more accurate in estimating the kinematic parameters.

The created methodology was used for investigation of <b>vehicle</b> <b>dynamic</b> effects by running at speed up to 230 km/h in the year 2004 in terms of high speed tests of tilting-body unit class 680 CD.
