The date given represents the day: that forest was established as is, a predecessor forest with the same boundaries was established under a different name, or the earliest date of establishment of a forest that was combined in whole with another forest.|$|E
5|$|Reflections in {{more complex}} scenarios, such as {{found on a}} network of cables, can result in <b>very</b> <b>complicated</b> and long lasting {{waveforms}} on the cable. Even a simple overvoltage pulse entering a cable system as uncomplicated as the power wiring found in a typical private home can result in an oscillatory disturbance as the pulse is reflected to and fro from multiple circuit ends. These ring waves as they are known persist for far longer than the original pulse and their waveforms bears little obvious resemblance to the original disturbance, containing high frequency components {{in the tens of}} MHz range.|$|E

5|$|Wing {{areas are}} delimited and {{subdivided}} by fold-lines along which the wing can fold, and flexion-lines along which the wing can flex during flight. The fundamental {{distinction between the}} flexion-lines and the fold-lines is often blurred, as fold-lines may permit some flexibility or vice versa. Two constants that are found in nearly all insect wings are the claval (a flexion-line) and jugal folds (or fold line); forming variable and unsatisfactory boundaries. Wing foldings can <b>very</b> <b>complicated,</b> with transverse folding occurs in the hindwings of Dermaptera and Coleoptera, and in some insects the anal area can be folded like a fan.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was <b>very</b> <b>complicated</b> and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E

To an extent, this mismatch can be incorporated in the quantization noise discussed next. Since it is a multiplicative factor, its effect on the reconstruction result will be <b>very</b> <b>complicate</b> and is left for future study.|$|R

25|$|Some bifurcations {{can lead}} to <b>very</b> <b>complicated</b> {{structures}} in phase space. For example, the RuelleTakens scenario describes how a periodic orbit bifurcates into a torus and the torus into a strange attractor. In another example, Feigenbaum period-doubling describes how a stable periodic orbit goes {{through a series of}} period-doubling bifurcations.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the motion}} of the Moon in its orbit is <b>very</b> <b>complicated</b> and its period is not constant. The date and time of this actual {{observation}} depends on the exact geographical longitude as well as latitude, atmospheric conditions, the visual acuity of the observers, etc. Therefore, the beginning and lengths of months defined by observation cannot be accurately predicted.|$|E

Although {{this is a very}} simple system it has a <b>very</b> <b>complicate</b> dynamic. We try to reveal some properties of this dynamic with modern numerical methods. For this reason we approximate stable and unstable manifolds which connect the steady states to obtain a complete understanding of the topology in the phase space.

If material is changed to stainless steel from the titanium at the place close to cavity, the regulation control should be much more relaxed.

40|$|We have {{recently}} {{reported that the}} spin transfer torque switching current density is very sensitive to not only the junction sizes but also the exchange stiffness constants of the free layer according to the micromagnetic simulations. The results are <b>very</b> <b>complicate</b> and far from the macro-spin model because of the non-coherent spin switching processes. The dependence of the switching current density on the junction sizes and the exchange stiffness constants becomes systematic when we employ the non-collinear polarizer layer. It is found that the non-collinear polarizer layer enhances the coherency of the spin dynamics by breaking symmetric spin configurations. Comment: 5 figure...|$|R

This method {{results in a}} <b>very</b> <b>complicated</b> set of equations in multiple dimensions, which are costly to solve.

Detailed convergent analysis on the choices of the expansion parameters is presented in this paper.
