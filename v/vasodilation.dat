5|$|Studies to {{quantify}} this theory {{have shown that}} there is an overall decreased systemic vascular resistance in hepatorenal syndrome, but that the measured femoral and kidney fractions of cardiac output are respectively increased and reduced, suggesting that splanchnic <b>vasodilation</b> is implicated in the kidney failure. Many vasoactive chemicals have been hypothesized as being involved in mediating the systemic hemodynamic changes, including atrial natriuretic factor, prostacyclin, thromboxane A2, and endotoxin. In addition to this, it has been observed that the administration of medications to counteract splanchnic <b>vasodilation</b> (such as ornipressin, terlipressin, and octreotide) leads to improvement in glomerular filtration rate (which is a quantitative measure of kidney function) in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, providing further evidence that splanchnic <b>vasodilation</b> is a key feature of its pathogenesis.|$|E
5|$|Apical {{periodontitis}} is acute {{or chronic}} inflammation around {{the apex of}} a tooth caused by an immune response to bacteria within an infected pulp. It does not occur because of pulp necrosis, meaning that a tooth that tests as if it's alive (vital) may cause apical periodontitis, and a pulp which has become non-vital due to a sterile, non-infectious processes (such as trauma) may not cause any apical periodontitis. Bacterial cytotoxins reach the region around {{the roots of the}} tooth via the apical foramina and lateral canals, causing <b>vasodilation,</b> sensitization of nerves, osteolysis (bone resorption) and potentially abscess or cyst formation.|$|E
5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause <b>vasodilation</b> {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply blood to the vital organs, and the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E
5|$|Capillaries are {{organized}} into capillary beds in tissues; {{it is here}} that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called <b>vasodilation</b> bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.|$|E
5|$|Each {{species of}} {{pathogen}} has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human hosts. Some organisms, such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, can cause skin infections, pneumonia, meningitis and even overwhelming sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response producing shock, massive <b>vasodilation</b> and death. Yet these organisms are {{also part of}} the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease at all. Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as the Rickettsia, which are obligate intracellular parasites able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms. One species of Rickettsia causes typhus, while another causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Chlamydia, another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause pneumonia, or urinary tract infection and may be involved in coronary heart disease. Finally, some species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and Mycobacterium avium, are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people suffering from immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis.|$|E
25|$|Slight <b>vasodilation</b> is seen {{in heart}} failure. This effect is {{contrary}} to effects that {{should be seen as}} a result of increased intracellular calcium levels, but this occurs since digoxin improves hemodynamics, which leads to restored angiotensin levels and decreased sympathetic discharge, causing indirect <b>vasodilation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Epinephrine (adrenaline) {{reacts with}} both α- and β-adrenoreceptors, causing {{vasoconstriction}} and <b>vasodilation,</b> respectively. Although α receptors are less sensitive to epinephrine, when activated at pharmacologic doses, they override the <b>vasodilation</b> mediated by β-adrenoreceptors {{because there are}} more peripheral α1 receptors than β-adrenoreceptors. The result is that high levels of circulating epinephrine cause vasoconstriction. At lower levels of circulating epinephrine (physiologic epinephrine secretion), β-adrenoreceptor stimulation dominates since epinephrine has a higher affinity for the β2 adrenoreceptor than the α1 adrenoreceptor, producing <b>vasodilation</b> followed by decrease of peripheral vascular resistance.|$|E
25|$|Sildenafil protects cyclic {{guanosine}} monophosphate (cGMP) from degradation by cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum of the penis binds to guanylate cyclase receptors, which results in increased levels of cGMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation (<b>vasodilation)</b> of the intimal cushions of the helicine arteries. This smooth muscle relaxation leads to <b>vasodilation</b> and increased inflow of blood into the spongy tissue of the penis, causing an erection. Robert F. Furchgott, Ferid Murad, and Louis Ignarro won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1998 for their independent study of the metabolic pathway of nitric oxide in smooth muscle <b>vasodilation.</b>|$|E
25|$|This <b>vasodilation</b> {{does not}} {{decrease}} {{the volume of}} blood the heart pumps, but rather it decreases the force the heart muscle must exert to pump the same volume of blood. Nitroglycerin pills, taken sublingually (under the tongue), are used to prevent or treat acute chest pain. The nitroglycerin reacts with a sulfhydryl group (–SH) to produce nitric oxide, which eases the pain by causing <b>vasodilation.</b> There is a potential role {{for the use of}} nitric oxide in alleviating bladder contractile dysfunctions, and recent evidence suggests that nitrates may be beneficial for treatment of angina due to reduced myocardial oxygen consumption both by decreasing preload and afterload and by some direct <b>vasodilation</b> of coronary vessels.|$|E
25|$|Androgen might (indirectly) block {{melatonin}} receptors, {{possibly by}} mean of <b>vasodilation,</b> and cause cholinergic abnormalities in some cases of Kleine–Levin syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Cutaneous receptors in {{the skin}} not only respond to touch, pressure, {{temperature}} and vibration, but also respond to <b>vasodilation</b> {{in the skin}} such as blushing.|$|E
25|$|Stimulation of stretch {{sensors that}} sense {{dilation}} of various blood vessels {{may result in}} pain, for example headache caused by <b>vasodilation</b> of brain arteries.|$|E
25|$|Immediately after a {{blood vessel}} is breached, {{ruptured}} cell membranes release inflammatory factors like thromboxanes and prostaglandins {{that cause the}} vessel to spasm to prevent blood loss and to collect inflammatory cells and factors in the area. This vasoconstriction lasts five to ten minutes and is followed by <b>vasodilation,</b> a widening of blood vessels, which peaks at about 20 minutes post-wounding. <b>Vasodilation</b> is {{the end result of}} factors released by platelets and other cells. The main factor involved in causing <b>vasodilation</b> is histamine. Histamine also causes blood vessels to become porous, allowing the tissue to become edematous because proteins from the bloodstream leak into the extravascular space, which increases its osmolar load and draws water into the area. Increased porosity of blood vessels also facilitates the entry of inflammatory cells like leukocytes into the wound site from the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} {{inadequate}} tissue perfusion (blood delivery to tissues) in distributive shock {{is a lack}} of normal responsiveness of blood vessels to vasoconstrictive agents and direct <b>vasodilation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Endogenous {{sulfur dioxide}} in low {{concentrations}} causes endothelium-dependent <b>vasodilation.</b> In higher concentrations it causes endothelium-independent <b>vasodilation</b> {{and has a}} negative inotropic effect on cardiac output function, thus effectively lowering blood pressure and myocardial oxygen consumption. The vasodilating and bronchodilating effects of sulfur dioxide are mediated via ATP-dependent calcium channels and L-type ("dihydropyridine") calcium channels. Endogenous sulfur dioxide is also a potent antiinflammatory, antioxidant and cytoprotective agent. It lowers blood pressure and slows hypertensive remodeling of blood vessels, especially thickening of their intima. It also regulates lipid metabolism.|$|E
25|$|The global {{effects on}} the body include {{tachycardia}} (increased heart rate), <b>vasodilation</b> in skin (flushing), slower breathing, reduced appetite, and increased secretions and excretions such as perspiration and urination.|$|E
25|$|By {{acting on}} {{vascular}} smooth muscle, they reduce contraction {{of the arteries}} and cause an increase in arterial diameter, a phenomenon called <b>vasodilation</b> (CCBs do not work on venous smooth muscle).|$|E
25|$|This {{contributes}} to local inflammation in a joint, specifically the synovium with edema, <b>vasodilation</b> and entry of activated T-cells, mainly CD4 in microscopically nodular aggregates and CD8 in microscopically diffuse infiltrates.|$|E
25|$|Calcium {{is needed}} to {{maintain}} bone health and for several metabolic functions, including muscle function, vascular contraction and <b>vasodilation,</b> nerve transmission, intracellular signalling and hormonal secretion. Ninety-nine percent of the body's calcium is stored in the bones and teeth.|$|E
25|$|Acetylcholine in the serum exerts {{a direct}} effect on {{vascular}} tone by binding to muscarinic receptors present on vascular endothelium. These cells respond by increasing production of nitric oxide, which signals the surrounding smooth muscle to relax, leading to <b>vasodilation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nitric oxide is {{considered}} an antianginal drug: It causes <b>vasodilation,</b> which can help with ischemic pain, known as angina, by decreasing the cardiac workload. By dilating (expanding) the arteries, nitric oxide drugs lower arterial pressure and left ventricular filling pressure.|$|E
25|$|Other leukocytes {{to enter}} the area include helper T cells, which secrete cytokines to cause more T cells to divide and to {{increase}} inflammation and enhance <b>vasodilation</b> and vessel permeability. T cells also increase the activity of macrophages.|$|E
25|$|Practitioners of {{hydrotherapy}} {{may seek}} {{use it to}} produce <b>vasodilation</b> and vasoconstriction. These cause changes in blood flow and associated metabolic functions, via physiological mechanisms, including those of thermoregulation, that are these days fairly well understood, and which underpin the contemporary use of hydrotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Extravasation is {{regulated}} by the background cytokine environment produced by the inflammatory response, and is independent of specific cellular antigens. Cytokines released in the initial immune response induce <b>vasodilation</b> and lower the electrical charge along the vessel's surface. Blood flow is slowed, facilitating intermolecular binding.|$|E
25|$|Damage to {{endothelium}} is {{an early}} abnormality {{in the development of}} scleroderma, and this too seems to be due to collagen accumulation by fibroblasts, although direct alterations by cytokines, platelet adhesion and a type II hypersensitivity reaction have similarly been implicated. Increased endothelin and decreased <b>vasodilation</b> has been documented.|$|E
25|$|A {{prescription}} extended release niacin, Niaspan, has a {{film coating}} that delays {{release of the}} niacin, resulting in an absorption {{over a period of}} 8–12 hours. The extended release formulations generally reduce <b>vasodilation</b> and flushing side effects, but increase the risk of hepatotoxicity compared to the immediate release forms.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{supplements}} of nitric oxide, {{the response is}} short-lived because, as a normally produced internal physiologic control mechanism, increased concentrations lead to increased rates of clearance, which {{is the reason that}} the effectiveness of sustained use of nitroglycerin for <b>vasodilation</b> fades to none after hours to days.|$|E
25|$|The {{class of}} CCBs known as dihydropyridines mainly affect {{arterial}} vascular smooth muscle and {{lower blood pressure}} by causing <b>vasodilation.</b> The phenylalkylamine class of CCBs mainly affect {{the cells of the}} heart and have negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects. The benzothiazepine class of CCBs combine effects of the other two classes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} step, heme is {{converted}} to biliverdin by the enzyme heme oxygenase (HMOX). NADPH is used as the reducing agent, molecular oxygen enters the reaction, carbon monoxide (CO) is produced and the iron is released from the molecule as the ferrous ion (Fe2+). CO acts as a cellular messenger and functions in <b>vasodilation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many of the prostanoids are know {{to mediate}} local {{symptoms}} of inflammation: vasoconstriction or <b>vasodilation,</b> coagulation, pain, and fever. Inhibition of COX-1 and/or the inducible COX-2 isoforms, is {{the hallmark of}} NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), such as aspirin. Prostanoids also activate the PPARγ members of the steroid/thyroid family of nuclear hormone receptors, and directly influence gene transcription.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{stimulation}} of angiogenesis {{is not well}} characterized. There is {{a significant amount of}} controversy with regard to shear stress acting on capillaries to cause angiogenesis, although current knowledge suggests that increased muscle contractions may increase angiogenesis. This may be due to an increase in the production of nitric oxide during exercise. Nitric oxide results in <b>vasodilation</b> of blood vessels.|$|E
25|$|Nitric oxide is a {{compound}} produced by many {{cells of the}} body. It relaxes vascular smooth muscle by binding to the heme moiety of cytosolic guanylate cyclase, activating guanylate cyclase and increasing intracellular levels of cyclic-guanosine 3’,5’-monophosphate, which then leads to <b>vasodilation.</b> When inhaled, nitric oxide dilates the pulmonary vasculature and, because of efficient scavenging by hemoglobin, has minimal effect on the vasculature of the entire body.|$|E
25|$|Dihydropyridine (DHP) {{calcium channel}} {{blockers}} {{are derived from}} the molecule dihydropyridine and often used to reduce systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure. Sometimes when {{they are used to}} treat angina, the <b>vasodilation</b> and hypotension can lead to reflex tachycardia, which can be detrimental for patients with ischemic symptoms because of the resulting increase in myocardial oxygen demand. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can worsen proteinuria in patients with nephropathy.|$|E
25|$|Use is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} on nonselective β-blockers, because severe hypertension and even cerebral hemorrhage may result. Although {{it is commonly}} believed that administration of adrenaline may cause heart failure by constricting coronary arteries, {{this is not the}} case. Coronary arteries have only β2 receptors, which cause <b>vasodilation</b> in the presence of adrenaline. Even so, administering high-dose adrenaline has not been definitively proven to improve survival or neurologic outcomes in adult victims of cardiac arrest.|$|E
25|$|Sympathetic {{stimulation}} {{results in}} the release of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine binding to α-adrenergic receptors will cause an increase in intracellular calcium levels leading to more fluid vs. protein secretion. If norepinephrine binds β-adrenergic receptors, it will result in more protein or enzyme secretion vs. fluid secretion. Stimulation by norepinephrine initially decreases {{blood flow to the}} salivary glands due to constriction of blood vessels but this effect is overtaken by <b>vasodilation</b> caused by various local vasodilators.|$|E
25|$|Professor of anthropology, Akazawa Takeru of the International Research Center for Japanese Studies in Kyoto Japan, {{said that}} Mongoloid {{features}} are an {{adaptation to the}} cold of the Mammoth steppe. He mentions the Lewis waves of warm blood cyclical <b>vasodilation</b> and vasoconstriction of the peripheral capillaries in Mongoloids as an adaption to the cold. He lists the short limbs, short noses, flat faces, epicanthic fold and lower surface-to-mass ratio as further Mongoloid adaptations to cold.|$|E
