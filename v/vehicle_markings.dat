25|$|Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations: This body of {{regulations}} cover {{all aspects of}} large truck and bus operations in the United States: the commercial driver's license (CDL) program, oversight of companies that transport freight or passengers, transport of hazardous materials, conditions under which a vehicle or a driver may be disqualified, drug and alcohol testing, hours of service of drivers, use of mobile phones, <b>vehicle</b> <b>markings,</b> securing of cargo, and many others.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with state law, the Iowa State Sheriffs' and Deputies' Association establishes the uniform and vehicle standards for all 99 counties. As such, all uniforms and patrol vehicle graphics {{are the same}} {{for each of the}} 99 Sheriff's Offices throughout Iowa {{with the exception of the}} respective County's name appearing on their badges, uniform patches, and <b>vehicle</b> <b>markings.</b> Badge numbers for Sheriffs and Deputies consist of a prefix number, which represents the county number, followed by a one to three digit number, which represents the Sheriff's or Deputy's number within that specific office. The Sheriff's badge number in each county is always #1. So the Sheriff from Bremer County would have an ID number of 9-1 (9 is the county number for Bremer County and 1 is the number for the Sheriff).|$|E
25|$|Until recently, most sheriff's {{officers}} wore {{a standardized}} uniform (black pants and shirt with dark gray straw Stetson {{hat in the}} summer and a black felt Stetson hat in the winter with a black Class A jacket for the dress uniform and a black leather jacket for the winter) and all patrol vehicles were marked in the same manner (white with red stripes, etc.). Several counties have moved away from these practices. Patrol cars in these counties have different <b>vehicle</b> <b>markings,</b> and deputy sheriffs wear different uniforms. Some examples are Ulster County, which has dark gray uniforms similar to the New York State Police; and Warren County, whose deputy sheriffs wear tan shirts with dark brown pants. Dutchess County Deputy Sheriffs wear tactical Class B uniforms consisting of black shirts and black pants and a Class A uniform with light blue shirts with darker blue pants. In Suffolk County, the sheriff vehicles are black and white (similar to the police/sheriff vehicle scheme used in California). In New York City, deputy sheriffs wear a uniform very similar to sworn NYPD personnel. Ontario County Sheriff's deputies wear the traditional uniform; black pants, black shirt with brass buttons, and a black stetson.|$|E
50|$|Not every <b>vehicle</b> {{displays}} <b>markings,</b> {{but those}} involved in response and traffic generally do. This factor stems from guidelines of the Association of Chief Police Officers relating to police air operations and pursuit management.|$|R
5000|$|After {{a late-night}} fire run, Los Angeles County Station 10 Fire & Rescue man John Gage (Randolph Mantooth), {{gets into a}} {{discussion}} with his battalion chief (Art Balinger) about joining a new program called the paramedics. At first Gage turns down the offer {{because he does not}} want to become an [...] "ambulance attendant". But in a failed rescue, the victim dies on arrival at Rampart Hospital. Noting the word [...] "rescue" [...] on the <b>vehicles</b> <b>markings,</b> Gage snorts derisively: [...] "Rescue, hell. All we rescued was a corpse." [...] As a result, he reconsiders his earlier reluctance and talks to someone about joining the paramedics; it is at this point that he first meets Los Angeles Fireman and future partner Roy DeSoto (Kevin Tighe).|$|R

2500|$|Three parallel, up-standing {{vertical}} bars {{accompanied by}} a small six in the lower right corner. Although a very basic symbol, this symbol likely originates, {{for the use of}} Death in June, from the 1943 Kursk version of the insignia of the 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf. This symbol was used as <b>vehicle</b> <b>markings</b> on the vehicles of that unit. It may have been used to signify the three members of Death in June at the time.

2500|$|Passive visual {{warnings}} are {{the markings}} on the vehicle. Police <b>vehicle</b> <b>markings</b> usually {{make use of}} bright colors or strong contrast with the base color of the vehicle. Modern police vehicles in some countries have retroreflective markings which reflect light for better visibility at night. Other police vehicles may only have painted on or non-reflective markings. Most marked police vehicles in the United Kingdom and Sweden have reflective Battenburg markings on the sides, which are large blue and yellow rectangles. These markings are designed to have high contrast and be highly visible on the road, to deter crime and improve safety. [...] Another passive visual warning of police vehicles is simply the interceptor's silhouette. [...] This is easily observed in the United States, where the ubiquitous nature of the Ford Crown Victoria in police fleets has made the model synonymous with police vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{division}} was subsequently relieved by the U.S. 36th Infantry Division. The 12th Armored Division suffered over 1,700 battle casualties during {{the fighting in}} and around Herrlisheim. As a consequence, when African-American soldiers who were in non-combat positions were able to volunteer to become combat troops, Major General Roderick R. Allen {{was one of only}} ten division commanders who allowed them to join the combat ranks. [...] After recovering from the bruising experience at Herrlisheim, the 12th went over to the offensive and attacked south from Colmar, after being assigned to the French First Army under General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny. In a lightning drive, the 12th effected junction with French forces at Rouffach, on 5 February, sealing the Colmar Pocket and ending German resistance in the Vosges Mountains. Except for elements acting as a protective screen, the division withdrew to the St. Avold area for rest and rehabilitation. The {{division was}} attached to the Third Army under General George S. Patton, Jr., on 17 March 1945 through its crossing of the Rhine on 28 March. The soldiers were ordered to remove their identifying unit insignias and <b>vehicle</b> <b>markings</b> were painted over, disguising the fact that Patton had an additional tank division under his command. Thus the 12th was given the nickname the [...] "Mystery Division". The attack resumed on 18 March 1945.|$|E
50|$|In 1948 the Department {{adopted the}} {{distinctive}} blue and gray paint scheme for all vehicles. Later in 1952 reflective markings were adopted {{and used for}} all marked <b>vehicles.</b> Those same <b>markings</b> are still in use today.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 new {{markings}} were enforced {{were the}} blue stripe although still solid {{was replaced with}} a highly reflective one, and the rear horizontal line was replaced from a solid blue stripe to a blue-white diagonal line similar to the rear usually found on <b>vehicles</b> with Battenburg <b>markings.</b>|$|R
40|$|Prior to the Space Shuttle Program, space-borne {{vehicles}} {{launched into}} space were expended; consequently their part identifiers were applied using marking processes {{designed for use}} in ground operations. With the advent of reusable space transportation vehicles and retrievable satellites, NASA needed to rethink how part identification markings are applied to their space borne <b>vehicles.</b> <b>Markings</b> applied to reusable spacecraft need to survive the extreme environments encountered in space. To support this new requirement, NASA approached RVSI (now Siemens) to assist with a marking program to certify marking(s) for use in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). An experiment was designed to identify part identification methods and techniques that might survive the rigors of space. The experiment was to be designed to expose both human and machine-readable markings to LEO environments. These include, {{but are not limited}} to, vacuum, solar UV radiation, micrometeoroids and space debris, atomic oxygen (AO) and deep thermal cycles. Two specimen packages were assembled. The first package was incorporated into MISSE 1 and 2 (one year orbital experiments) and consisted of currently approved marking processes and number of newly developed Laser Additive marking techniques deemed safe for use in safety critical applications. The second package contained a series of more robust intrusive marking technique that utilized higher-powered laser markers. These specimens were incorporated in MISSE 3 and 4, which was scheduled to fly in orbit for three years. This report describes the results of the MISSE 1 and 2 marking experiments...|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to regular EMS, many jurisdictions also have non-emergency patient transport services operating. In many jurisdictions, these are companies {{who specialize in}} non-emergency patient transfers. [...] Such companies have their own vehicles, which are similar to ambulances and carry some similar patient care equipment. These services can relieve the workload on public EMS through the elimination of some, or most, of the non-emergency transfer volume, and some provide service {{to the public that}} is of the highest standard. In many cases, such services are small private businesses, using second-hand ambulances which have been retired from public EMS service, while others use vehicles expressly built for their purposes. There has, however, been some controversy, in some jurisdictions, with respect to the operating procedures of some (but not all) of these services. [...] In some cases, the vehicles are often made to look as much like EMS ambulances as possible, even retaining emergency lights and sirens (which they are forbidden by law to use), and incorporating the word [...] "paramedic" [...] (this term is not protected in Canada yet), variations on [...] "EMS" [...] (in some cases, [...] "event medical services") or spelling variations of [...] "ambulance", such as [...] "ambu-lans", or using the Star of Life logo on their <b>vehicle</b> <b>markings.</b> These services are not generally licensed, or required to meet any recognized standard. These services generally attempt to recruit staff who meet provincial EMS qualification standards, but are under no legal obligation to do so. Such services are not covered by provincial health insurance, operate on a fee-for-service basis, and are not considered to be a legitimate part of mainstream EMS.|$|E

5000|$|The current primary Louisiana State Police patrol {{vehicle is}} the Chevrolet Tahoe. The agency began a {{conversion}} to the Tahoe in 2012. Previously, the agency used the Ford Crown Victoria [...] "Police Interceptor." [...] This vehicle {{was the main}} patrol vehicle used by the agency from 1997 to 2011, when it replaced the Chevrolet Caprice in 1996, and when the Crown Victoria was discontinued in 2011. The <b>vehicle's</b> <b>markings</b> include [...] "State Trooper" [...] written on each front quarter panel, a state badge {{on the center of}} each front door, the words [...] "Louisiana State Police" [...] written above and below the door badge, and the words [...] "State Police" [...] written on the trunk. Note that the markings on the Tahoe include a slight variation to the previously used designs. In 2012 the coloring on the door badge has been redesigned. It changed from a light blue to a darker blue, with a state seal done differently as well. It is completely different from the prior one used since 1964 except in dimension. The red [...] "LSP" [...] lettering also now has a small dark blue border around each letter. An [...] "ACE" [...] insignia, consisting of a blue State of Louisiana with a red lighting bolt, is awarded to troopers who recover five or more stolen vehicles within a year. Since approximately 2001, a majority of the marked patrol vehicles utilized by this agency have been equipped with onboard video cameras. Other 'marked' patrol vehicles currently used include Harley-Davidson motorcycles, the Chevrolet Impala, the Chevrolet Camaro, the Chevrolet Suburban, Chevrolet Caprice, Ford Taurus, and the Dodge Durango. Several other unmarked vehicles in various makes and models are also used for various non-patrol purposes. Police vehicles currently being tested and considered for use include the Dodge Charger. In August 2010, nearly all marked Chevrolet Impala vehicles in inventory were taken out of service, with only a few still in service.|$|R
25|$|During {{the initial}} stages of the corps's founding, most of the {{vehicles}} therein were reconstructed from scrapped British vehicles, and served various purposes.

Landespolizei tactical vehicles were painted a lighter shade of green all over.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in the 1970s, police <b>vehicle</b> <b>markings</b> {{have become}} {{increasingly}} stylistic, with widespread use of computer-graphics and vinyl striping.
