5|$|Bakaara Market {{was created}} in late 1972 by the Barre administration. It served as an open market {{for the sale of}} goods and services, {{including}} produce and clothing. After the start of the civil war, the market was controlled by various militant groups, who used it as a base for their operations. Following Mogadishu's pacification in 2011, renovations resumed at the market. Shops were rehabilitated, selling everything from fruit and garments to building materials. As {{in the rest of the}} city, Barkaara Market's real estate <b>values</b> <b>have</b> also risen considerably. , the local Tabaarak firm was renting out a newly constructed warehouse at the market for $2,000 per month.|$|E
5|$|The {{exposure}} levels to free crystalline silica in the ash {{are commonly used}} to characterise the risk of silicosis in occupational studies (for {{people who work in}} mining, construction and other industries,) because it is classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Guideline <b>values</b> <b>have</b> been created for exposure, but with unclear rationale; UK guidelines for particulates in air (PM10) are 50µg/m3 and USA guidelines for exposure to crystalline silica are 50µg/m3.

5|$|Traditional <b>values</b> <b>have</b> {{endured the}} attempt by western {{institutions}} {{to impose a}} positive image of deviant behavior. For instance, {{in spite of the}} removal of homosexuality from the nomenclature of mental disorders, 62.5% of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in the Rostov Region view it as an illness, and up to three quarters view it as immoral behavior. The psychiatrists sustain the ban on gay parades and the use of veiled schemes to lay off openly lesbian and gay persons from schools, child care centers, and other public institutions. The chief psychiatrist of Russia Zurab Kekelidze in his 2013 interview to Dozhd says that a part of the cases of homosexuality is a mental disorder, he counters the remark that the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the list of mental disorders by stating that it is not true. Homosexuality, which is a mental disorder, was continuously defined as such by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia in 2005 when its president Savenko expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the Executive Committee of the American Psychiatric Association to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry due to political pressure from western NGOs and governments, referred the proposal to antipsychiatric actions, and stated that ideological, social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one. In 2014, Savenko changed his mind about homosexuality, and he along with Alexei Perekhov succumb to pressure and, in their joint paper criticized and referred the trend to consider homosexuality as a mental disorder to Soviet mentality.|$|E

25|$|In the environment, {{bacteria}} preferentially produce 5α-cholestan-3β-ol (5α-cholestanol) from cholesterol {{rather than}} the 5β isomer.

No cut-off <b>values</b> <b>have</b> been suggested for this marker and so it is used in a relative sense; the greater the ratio, the more reducing the environment. Reducing environments are frequently associated with areas experiencing high organic matter input; this may include sewage derived discharges. The relationship between reducing conditions and the potential source can be seen in a cross plot with a sewage indicator.|$|E
25|$|Many Korean Christians {{believe that}} their <b>values</b> <b>have</b> had a {{positive}} effect on various social relationships. Traditional Korean society was hierarchically arranged according to Confucian principles under the semi-divine emperor. Women had no social rights, children were totally subservient to their parents, and individuals had no rights except as defined by the overall social system. This structure was challenged by the Christian teaching that all human beings are created in the image of God and thus that every one of them is equal and has essential worth. According to Kim Han-sik, this concept also supported the idea of property being owned by individuals rather than by families (or by the heads of families).|$|E
