60|$|Wyllard, who had {{inspected}} the stores, fancied that a fortnight was the <b>very</b> <b>longest</b> {{that could be}} counted on, though they ate no more than would keep a modicum of strength in them. From their kind and quality he surmised {{that they had been}} intended for the officials in charge of the settlement.|$|R
5000|$|In 2017, {{the band}} gaps of {{confined}} linear carbon chains inside double-walled carbon nanotubes with lengths ranging from 36 up to 6000 carbon atoms were determined {{for the first}} time ranging from 2.26-1.84 eV, and accurately follow an inverse proportionalitywith length, up to the <b>very</b> <b>longest</b> (quasi-infinite) chains. Also,the band gap was observed to converge to 1.83 eV for infinite chains--carbyne.|$|R

5|$|Among the {{numerous}} radioactive isotopes of zirconium, 93Zr {{is among the}} most common. It is released as a product of 235U, mainly in nuclear plants and during nuclear weapons tests in the 1950s and 1960s. It has a <b>very</b> <b>long</b> half-life (1.53 million years), its decay emits only low energy radiations, and it is not considered as highly hazardous.|$|E
5|$|An article {{published}} in 1997 reported research of the mechanics of Apatosaurus tails by Nathan Myhrvold and paleontologist Philip J. Currie. Myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail, which in diplodocids like Apatosaurus was a <b>very</b> <b>long,</b> tapering structure resembling a bullwhip. This computer modeling suggested sauropods were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over 200 decibels, comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired.|$|E
5|$|An {{orangutan}} {{has a large}}, bulky body, a thick neck, <b>very</b> <b>long,</b> strong arms, short, bowed legs, and no tail. It {{is mostly}} covered with long, reddish-brown hair and grey-black skin. Sumatran orangutans have more sparse and lighter-coloured coats. The orangutan has a large head with a prominent mouth area. Though largely hairless, their faces can develop some hair in males, giving them a moustache.|$|E

5|$|Another myth {{surrounding}} this species {{is that it}} occasionally catches small monkeys and other large animals in its pitchers. Such tales have persisted for a <b>very</b> <b>long</b> time, but can probably be explained as rodents being mistaken for other species. It {{is interesting to note}} that one common name for Nepenthes plants is 'Monkey Cups'. The name refers to the fact that monkeys have been observed drinking rainwater from these plants.|$|E
5|$|As the {{atmosphere}} is transparent for radio waves, radio telescopes in space are of most use for <b>Very</b> <b>Long</b> Baseline Interferometry; doing simultaneous observations of a source with both a satellite and a ground-based telescope and by correlating their signals to simulate a radio telescope {{the size of the}} separation between the two telescopes. Observations can be of supernova remnants, masers, gravitational lenses, starburst galaxies, and many other things.|$|E
5|$|Basketball has a <b>very</b> <b>long</b> {{history in}} England, being {{introduced}} {{there by the}} YMCA almost immediately after it was invented (having been created by the Canadian Dr. James Naismith in 1891 in Massachusetts). World War I and II further spurred its popularity.|$|E

5|$|Carbon {{can form}} <b>very</b> <b>long</b> chains of {{interconnecting}} carbon–carbon bonds, a property {{that is called}} catenation. Carbon-carbon bonds are strong and stable. Through catenation, carbon forms a countless number of compounds. A tally of unique compounds shows that more contain carbon that those that do not. A similar claim {{can be made for}} hydrogen because most organic compounds also contain hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Due to Tool's {{incorporation}} {{of visual arts}} and <b>very</b> <b>long</b> and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock. The relationship between the band and today's music industry is ambivalent, at times marked by censorship, and the band's insistence on privacy.|$|E
5|$|From −125,000 till +125,000 {{there are}} only about ten 243-year series at both nodes {{regarding}} all the transits of Venus in this <b>very</b> <b>long</b> time-span, because both nodes of the orbit of Venus move back and forward in time as seen from the Earth.|$|E

5000|$|A {{piece of}} metal heated by a torch first becomes [...] "red hot" [...] as the <b>very</b> <b>longest</b> visible {{wavelengths}} appear red, then becomes more orange-red as the temperature is increased, and at very high temperatures would be described as [...] "white hot" [...] as shorter and shorter wavelengths come to predominate the black body emission spectrum. Before it had even reached the red hot temperature, the thermal emission was mainly at longer infrared wavelengths which are not visible; nevertheless that radiation could be felt as it warms one's nearby skin.|$|R

5|$|However, Napoleon did {{not rule}} France again for <b>very</b> <b>long,</b> {{suffering}} a decisive defeat {{at the hands of}} the armies of the Duke of Wellington and Field Marshal Blücher at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June. The Allies came to the consensus that Louis XVIII should be restored to the throne of France.|$|E
5|$|Jodrell Bank {{has been}} {{involved}} with <b>Very</b> <b>Long</b> Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) since the late 1960s; the Lovell telescope took part in the first transatlantic interferometer experiment in 1968, with other telescopes being those at Algonquin and Penticton in Canada. The Lovell Telescope and the Mark II telescopes are regularly used for VLBI with telescopes across Europe (the European VLBI Network), giving a resolution of around 0.001 arcseconds.|$|E
5|$|Long lustrous female hair is {{generally}} rated attractive by {{both men and}} women across cultures. The prevalence of trichophilia (hair partialism or fetishism) is 7% in the population, and <b>very</b> <b>long</b> hair is a common subject of devotion in this group.|$|E
