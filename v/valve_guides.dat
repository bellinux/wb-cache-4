50|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} which show that through the proper selection of the reamer and reaming process, <b>valves</b> <b>guides</b> can be quickly and efficiently reamed to a consistently repeatable size.|$|R
50|$|In most {{types of}} {{reciprocating}} engines, a <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> is provided for each poppet valve in the cylinder head. Along with the valve spring, it serves to positively locate the valve {{so that it}} may make proper contact with the valve seat. A <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> is a cylindrical piece of metal, pressed or integrally cast into the cylinder head, with the valve reciprocating inside it. Guides also serve to conduct heat from the combustion process out from the exhaust valve and into the cylinder head where it may be {{taken up by the}} cooling system. Bronze is commonly used, as is steel; a balance between stiffness and wear on the valve is essential to achieve a useful service life.|$|R

50|$|Introduced in 1997 (1998 model year), all Corollas for the North American market {{were now}} built in Fremont, California (by NUMMI) or Cambridge, Ontario (by TMMC). Unlike the Japanese counterparts, the North American Corolla {{at this time}} was only offered as a four-door compact sedan. A new all-aluminum 1ZZ-FE engine powered all Corollas, making this {{generation}} lighter than its predecessor. This new engine uses a timing chain instead of a timing belt. It also incorporated laser etched <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> directly in the block, rather than the old shrink to fit <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> in the predecessor Corolla motor (4A-FE & 7A-FE). This prevents oil burning and valve guide failure in the future.|$|E
50|$|The 1928 DeLuxe engine {{had higher}} compression, and hardened, {{polished}} steel <b>valve</b> <b>guides.</b> The front end {{was changed to}} leading link forks and a front brake was added. The wheels were also changed to drop center rims (may have happened mid year).|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} ways in which a valve seat may be {{improperly}} positioned or machined. These include incomplete seating during the press fitting-step, distortion of the nominally circular valve seat surfaces such they deviate unacceptably from perfect roundness or waviness, tilt of the machined surfaces relative to the <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> hole axis, deviation of the valve seat surfaces from concentricity with the <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> holes, and deviation of the machined conical section of the valve seat from the cone angle that is required to match the valve surface. Automated quality control of inserted and machined valve seats has traditionally been very difficult to achieve until the advent of digital holography which has enabled high-definition metrology for measuring all of these listed deviations.|$|R
50|$|The {{clearance}} {{between the}} inner {{diameter of the}} <b>valve</b> <b>guide</b> and the outer diameter of the poppet valve stem is critical for the proper performance of an engine. If there is too little clearance, the valve may stick as oil contaminants and thermal expansion become factors. If {{there is too much}} clearance, the valve may not seat properly and excessive oil consumption can occur.|$|R
2500|$|Valve gear {{was of the}} low-maintenance Baker type, with (of course) power reverse. A {{front-end}} throttle was installed, {{with the}} distinctive linkage running along the boiler on the engineer's side. [...] A mechanical lubricator, driven from the crosshead on the engineer's side, fed oil to the cylinders, <b>valves,</b> <b>guides</b> {{and other parts of}} the running gear. Many of the locomotives were fitted with a speedometer, which was attached to the engineerâ€™s side frontmost leading axle.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the valve design for these motors was the double <b>valve</b> <b>guides,</b> and the {{attachment}} of the forked rocker arm to a shoulder between the guides, to eliminate side forces on the valve stem and ensure maximum valve life under racing conditions.|$|E
50|$|Over time, {{the inner}} {{diameter}} of the valve guide and the outer {{diameter of the}} valve stem may become worn. In the 1980s, many U.S. production engine remanufacturers began reaming <b>valve</b> <b>guides,</b> rather than replacing them, {{as part of their}} remanufacturing process. They found that by reaming all the <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> in a head to one standard size (typically 0.008 in. diametrically oversized), and installing remanufactured engine valves having stems that are also oversized, a typical engine head can be remanufactured in much less time. Since the reaming process leaves the valve guide with a much better surface finish and shape than typical replacement guides, and since the oversize valves often have chrome plated stems, remanufacturers also discovered that valve train warranty issues are virtually eliminated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine is}} of rugged {{heavy-duty}} construction throughout. All wearing parts such as cylinder liners, bearings, <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> and inserts are precision parts and are readily replaceable, which adds to engine life {{and ease of}} repair. Large main bearing and crankpin journals assure long bearing life." ...|$|E
50|$|It {{seems to}} have been seen as a {{valuable}} safety <b>valve</b> and <b>guide</b> to the shape of a free market. Holden dealers even incorporated the statistics in their advertising.|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of a hole, usually round or oval, and a tapered plug, usually a disk shape {{on the end of}} a shaft also called a valve stem. The portion of the hole where the plug meets with it is referred to as the 'seat' or 'valve seat'. The shaft guides the plug portion by sliding through a <b>valve</b> <b>guide.</b> In exhaust applications a pressure differential helps to seal the valve and in intake valves a pressure differential helps open it. Poppet valves date from at least the 1770s, when James Watt used them on his steam engines.|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} lever combines these two motions with the resultant acting upon the valve stem (13), suitably restrained by the <b>valve</b> stem <b>guide</b> (10), {{which in turn}} acts upon the piston valve (14).|$|R
5000|$|Cylinder head. A {{cylinder}} head assembly is installed {{with a head}} gasket and torqued to specification. Complete {{cylinder head}}s include valves, valve springs, <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> (if applicable), valve seats (if applicable), valve locks, and valve keepers. Flathead engines include the valve train if it didn't come with the short block.|$|E
50|$|As <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> wear, {{their ability}} to {{positively}} locate the valve to the valve seat decreases. As the valves lose {{their ability to}} seal the combustion chamber properly, the engine can lose performance and start to burn oil, leaking {{from the top of}} the cylinder head into the intake and exhaust manifolds. Modern engines are fitted with valve stem oil seals which can be replaced if oil leakage occurs.|$|E
5000|$|An {{advanced}} {{feature of}} the new Meteor engine was an invention to reduce valve failure, which they decided was caused by lateral vibration. A special design of upper and lower <b>valve</b> <b>guides,</b> without a centre section, meant that the valves had no fulcrum and into the central section they fitted a forked rocker pressed onto a shouldered valve stem. This effectively eliminated the 'rocking' action of the conventional top-end rocker and Vincent top ends set a new performance standard.|$|E

5000|$|Piston-type: air {{compressors}} use this principle by pumping air into an air chamber {{through the use}} of the constant motion of pistons. They use one-way <b>valves</b> to <b>guide</b> air into a cylinder chamber, where the air is compressed.|$|R
5000|$|The engine {{components}} {{were designed for}} ease of access and maintenance. The <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> and valves could be removed without removing the engine from the motorcycle. [...] The cylinder heads were integral with the engine. The intake and exhaust manifolds were cast as one piece such that the exhaust would heat the fuel mixture to improve fuel atomization. The engine had a large external flywheel {{on the left side}} similar to that on the horizontal single-cylinder Moto Guzzi.|$|E
50|$|The Prizm's 1998 {{redesign}} {{coincided with}} the conversion of all remaining Geo models into Chevrolets. The most notable change was the new 1.8-liter engine, which was now all-aluminum, driven by a timing chain (instead of a belt), and making more power (with the same fuel economy) than the engines from the Geo years. The new all-aluminum 1ZZ-FE engine powered all Corollas, Sprinters, and Prizms, making this generation lighter than its predecessor. This new engine incorporated laser-etched <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> directly in the block, rather than the old shrink to fit <b>valve</b> <b>guides</b> in the previous Corolla motor (4A-FE & 7A-FE). This prevented oil burning and valve guide failure. The Prizm with the Corolla became the first cars in the compact class to offer optional side airbags. All 1998 Prizms without the LSi's optional handling package (containing a front stabilizer bar) were singled out by Consumer Reports for having sloppy emergency handling; Toyota addressed the problem for 1999 by making the handling package standard. For 2000, the engine gained variable valve timing for five extra horsepower (to 125). The last Prizm was built on December 13, 2001, resulting in a brief 2002 model year.|$|E
50|$|Early {{versions}} of the Speed Six engine suffered from poor valve train durability leading to many warranty claims against TVR. Subsequent third party development work has mitigated this issue by using revised material harnesses for the cam lobes, finger followers and <b>valve</b> <b>guides.</b> Softer valve springs and valves with thicker stems were also utilised. Engines that have had these modifications performed have much improved durability. Another third party development offers a redesigned cylinder head with cam and bucket valve actuation so eliminating the use of finger followers altogether.|$|E
