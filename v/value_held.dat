2500|$|Marxist (later, Marxian) {{economics}} descends from classical economics. It {{derives from}} the work of Karl Marx. The first volume of Marx's major work, Das Kapital, was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and the theory of surplus value which, he believed, explained the exploitation of labour by capital. • [...] The labour theory of <b>value</b> <b>held</b> that the value of an exchanged commodity was determined by the labour that went into its production and the theory of surplus value demonstrated how the workers only got paid a proportion of the value their work had created.|$|E
2500|$|Classical economists {{presented}} competing {{theories of}} those of Smith, termed the [...] "labour theory of value". Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith's labour theories, in part. The first volume of Karl Marx's major work, Capital, was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he {{considered to be the}} exploitation of labour by capital. The labour theory of <b>value</b> <b>held</b> that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern contention of neoclassical economics, that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.|$|E

5000|$|Normal-cardinality {{refers to}} columns with {{values that are}} {{somewhat}} uncommon. Normal-cardinality column values are typically names, street addresses, or vehicle types. An example of a data table column with normal-cardinality would be a CUSTOMER table with a column named LAST_NAME, containing the last names of customers. While some people have common last names, such as Smith, others have uncommon last names. Therefore, an examination {{of all of the}} <b>values</b> <b>held</b> in the LAST_NAME column would show [...] "clumps" [...] of names in some places (e.g. a lot of Smith's) surrounded on both sides by a long series of unique values. Since there is a variety of possible <b>values</b> <b>held</b> in this column, its cardinality type would be referred to as normal-cardinality.|$|R

40|$|The {{protection}} of Aboriginal cultural heritage sites {{is not consistent}} across Australian states.

It is also because {{it is not clear what}} <b>values</b> are <b>held</b> within the Australian community for protecting sites.

One major difference between stored-value cards and prepaid cards is that prepaid cards are usually issued {{in the name of}} the individual account holders, while stored value cards are usually anonymous.
