40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the stability (- 18 degrees C) of minced African catfish (MF) for 180 days. Microbiological aspects, lipid oxidation, and total <b>volatile</b> <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>bases</b> (TVB-N) of the MF were determined with and without washing. Washing of the MF caused an increase in moisture content, decrease in proteins, and leaching of the compounds responsible for lipid oxidation. The TVB-N remained stable during the storage period. The microbiological parameters of the MF remained within the legal limits. Thus, a 180 -days storage period does not affect the quality of MF and could be a good alternative for the exploitation of this species in Brazil...|$|R
40|$|Estimation {{of total}} <b>volatile</b> <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>bases</b> has been {{generally}} {{made use of}} in routine analysis for the chemical assessment {{of the degree of}} spoilage in fish samples. The measurement of this index of spoilage furnishes a reasonably accurate and rapid method for the determination of the keeping quality of cured fish products. In fact it haa been pointed out by Velankar (1952) that total volatile nitrogen gives a better index of spoilage than the trimethylamine content. Tarr and Ney (1949) also observed that the test for the amount of trimethylamine present is not likely to prove a very sensitive measurement of the bacterial spoilage of varieties of Pacific coast fishes. It is suggested that trimethylamine is a product during the early stages of spoilage (Collins, 1938; Hess, 1941) and that it may be lost indiscriminately during storage...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the physicochemical and microbiological stability of sausages produced from mechanically separated fish meat (MSM) obtained from Nile tilapia filleting residues. Different heat treatments (pasteurization or smoking) and packaging systems (conventional or vacuum) were used. The sausages were characterized for chemical composition, weight loss, water activity, instrumental texture and sensorial analysis. Additionally, microbiological analysis, instrumental color, pH, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N) were assessed during storage. No presence of Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp. or coagulase-positive Staphylococcus was detected; however, the psychrotrophic count in pasteurized sausages exceeded the limits allowed for consumption. pH and lipid oxidation speed (TBARS) values were reduced when vacuum packaging was used. <b>Volatile</b> <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>bases</b> remained virtually constant during the storage period, and higher values were observed in smoked products. Pasteurized sausages remain stable for 10 and 15 days in conventional and vacuum packages, respectively, and smoked sausages remain stable for 25 and 45 days in conventional and vacuum packages, respectively...|$|R

However, these wastes {{can be used for}} the extraction of minced fish (MF) which can be used in the preparation of sausages. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the quality of sausages prepared with 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 % of MF from Nile tilapia filleting waste during storage at 0 ± 0. 3 ºC. Alterations in the instrumental color (L*, a* and b*), lipid oxidation (TBARS), total <b>volatile</b> <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>bases</b> (TVB-N), pH, microbiological condition (pathogenic bacteria and aerobic psychrotrophic bacteria), and sensory attributes (color, odor, flavor, texture and overall acceptability) were evaluated for up to 40 days. The addition of MF to sausages increased TBARS values and decreases TVB-N, L*, a* and b* values. Acceptability of color attribute decreased with increasing MF; best flavor, texture and overall acceptability scores were registered for sausages containing 40 and 60 % MF; best odor was registered for 100 % MF. Pathogenic microorganisms were not detected, but decrease in pH and proliferation of aerobic psychrotrophic bacteria which, however, did not compromise sensory evaluation of sausages were registered throughout storage. Sausages prepared with MF from tilapia filleting waste have a shelf-life of 40 days when stored at 0 ± 0. 3 ºC, and the maximum recommended MF inclusion to maintain good sensory quality is 60 %...|$|R
