Currently, no radon mitigation measures are in place in the underground environment, and the continuing evolution of the facility ventilation systems has led to significant variations in early airborne radon concentrations. The average radon concentration measured near the primary <b>ventilation</b> <b>intake</b> for the 4850 -ft level (Yates shaft) is 391 Bq/m{sup 3 }, based on approximately 146 days of data. The corresponding average radon concentration near the other main <b>ventilation</b> <b>intake</b> for the 4850 -ft level (Ross shaft) is 440 Bq/m{sup 3 } based on approximately 350 days of data. Measurements have also been collected near the 1250 -ft level Ross shaft, with average radon concentrations at 180 Bq/m{sup 3 }. Secondary factors that may increase the baseline radon level underground include the presence of iron oxide and moisture, which are known to enhance radon emanation. The results of the current radon monitoring program will be used for the planning of future measurements and any potential optimization of ventilation parameters for the reduction of radon in relevant areas underground...|$|E

We aimed to measure energy and protein intakes {{of patients in}} acute respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation receiving standard hospital nutritional care. Methods Food and fluid intake forms were completed by nursing staff for all meals and mid meals for patients admitted with respiratory failure commencing on non-invasive <b>ventilation.</b> <b>Intake</b> was converted from quartiles of food consumed into energy and protein to enable comparison with estimated daily requirements using descriptive statistics. Multinomial stepwise regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with inadequate protein and energy intake. Results Over 283 total days of intake, 36 participants (67 % female, aged 65 ᠹ years) achieved on average 1434 ᠶ 27 kcal and 63 ᠲ 9 g protein daily. Overall, 28 patients (78 %, 95 % CI: 61 - 90 %) met less than 80 % of estimated energy requirements and 27 patients (75 %, 95 % CI: 58 - 88 %) met less than 80 % of estimated protein requirements. Being fed orally, longer time on non-invasive ventilation and higher BMI were associated with poorer intakes. Better nutritional status on admission and measuring intake closer to hospital discharge was associated with improved intakes. Conclusion Patients with acute respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation often had inadequate oral intake, particularly with increasing time on non-invasive ventilation, and earlier during their hospital admission. Development of protocols to optimise nutritional intake for these patients may improve outcomes and reduce regular readmission rates. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Tritium in air is {{monitored}} at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) with air breathing instruments based on ionization chambers. Stack emissions are continuously monitored from sample tubes which each connect to a Tritium bubble which differentially collects HTO and HT. A set of glass vials of glycol capture the HTO. The HT is oxidized with a palladium catalyst {{and the resultant}} HTO is captured in {{a second set of}} vials of glycol. The glycol is counted with a liquid scintillation counter. All calibrations are performed with tritium containing gas. The Radiation Instrumentation and Calibration (RIC) Team has constructed and maintains two closed loop gas handling systems based on femto TECH model U 24 tritium ion chamber monitors: a fixed system housed in a fume hood and a portable system mounted on two two wheeled hand trucks. The U 24 monitors are calibrated against tritium in nitrogen gas standards. They are used as standard transfer instruments to calibrate other ion chamber monitors with tritium in nitrogen, diluted with air. The gas handling systems include a circulation pump which permits a closed circulation loop to be established among the U 24 monitor and typically two to four other monitors of a given model during calibration. Fixed and portable monitors can be calibrated. The stack bubblers are calibrated in the field by: blending a known concentration of tritium in air within the known volume of the two portable carts, coupled into a common loop; releasing that gas mixture into a <b>ventilation</b> <b>intake</b> to the stack; collecting oxidized tritium in the bubbler; counting the glycol; and using the stack and bubbler flow rates, computing the bubbler`s efficiency.

40|$|The CREV System {{provides}} a radiologically controlled environment {{from which the}} unit can be safely operated following a Design Basis Accident (DBA). The control room emergency zone served by the CREV System consists of the main control room and the Train B Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment room. The safety related function of the CREV System consists of a single high efficiency air filtration train for emergency treatment of outside supply air. The filter train consists of an electric heater, a prefilter, a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, an activated charcoal adsorber section, a second HEPA filter, two 100 % capacity booster fans in parallel, the Train B air handling unit (excluding the refrigeration condensing unit), and the associated ductwork and dampers. The electric heater is used to limit the relative humidity of the air entering the filter train. Prefilters and HEPA filters remove particulate matter, which may be radioactive. The charcoal adsorbers provide a holdup period for gaseous iodine, allowing time for decay. The CREV System is a standby system, parts of which also operate during normal unit operations to maintain the control room emergency zone environment. Upon receipt of a reactor building ventilation system high-high radiation alarm (indicative of conditions {{that could result in}} radiation exposure to control room emergency zone personnel), operator action is required within 40 minutes to switch to the isolation/pressurization mode of operation and close the kitchen and locker room exhaust fan dampers to minimize infiltration of contaminated air into the control room emergency zone.

During our stay on board benzene has been loaded in three tanks and later on these tanks have been cleaned and ventilated during our measurements. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO), recognized that chronic exposure to very low concentrations of benzene vapors in air, of the order of a few parts per million, may cause leukaemia. According to Madl, benzene exposure on board of crude oil and chemical tankers do not pose a health risk to deck crewman. interpretation of the results will soon demonstrate if we can confirm Madl’s statement on board of this type of vessels.

An aspect ratio (AR) of 2. 7 and a Reynolds number of 5 x 10 6 with a one main vortex, were used. This study focused mainly on the vehicle-induced momentum source and PM 2. 5 concentrations were measured at 10 altitudes near the leeward wall in the street canyon, to provide high resolution measurements for model validation. The simulated PM 2. 5 concentrations agreed well with the measurements, (R= 0. 85). The concentration was higher at the lower part near the leeward wall than the upper part. Higher concentration was found near the roof level. A near-uniform vertical dispersion of PM 2. 5 near the windward wall was demonstrated; and the average concentrations were lower than found near the leeward wall. The intermittent escape of the PM 2. 5 above the canyon at the roof level occurred mainly at the centre and near windward wall areas.

In this study, a source (i. e. a patient who generates droplets) and a receiver (i. e. a susceptible object other than the source) are modeled in a mechanically ventilated room. The receiver's exposure to the droplet nuclei is analyzed under two orientations relative to the source. Two droplet nuclei, 0. 1 and 10 μm, with different emission velocities, are selected to represent large expiratory droplets which can still be inhaled into the human respiratory tracts.

Moreover, longitudinal measurements of both total urinary nitrogen (TUN) and resting energy expenditure (REE) are lacking. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate how much protein and energy are needed to equilibrate nitrogen and energy balances in ventilated critically ill children on the basis of daily measurements of TUN, REE and protein and energy intakes. Comparisons were made with the guidelines of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition and the Dietary Reference Intakes. Children with an expected duration of mechanical ventilation ≥ 72  h were prospectively recruited. TUN was measured by chemiluminescence, and REE was measured by indirect calorimetry. Generalised linear models for longitudinal data were used to study the relation between protein intake and nitrogen balance and to calculate the minimum intake of protein needed to achieve nitrogen equilibrium. A similar approach was used for energy. Results were compared to the recommended values. Based on 402 measurements performed in 74 children (median age: 21 months), the mean TUN was high at 0. 20 (95 % CI: 0. 20, 0. 22) g/kg/d and the REE was 55 (95 % CI: 54, 57) kcal/kg/d. Nitrogen and energy balances were achieved with 1. 5 (95 % CI: 1. 4, 1. 6) g/kg/d of protein and 58 (95 % CI: 53, 63) kcal/kg/d for the entire group, but there were differences among children of different ages.

50|$|If {{equipped}} with internal combustion or turbine engines, engine rooms employ some means of providing air {{for the operation}} of the engines and associated ventilation. If individuals are normally present in these rooms, additional ventilation should be available to keep engine room temperatures to acceptable limits.

This would require an unrestricted hull opening of {{the same size as the}} intake area of the engine itself, assuming the hull opening is in the engine room itself. Commonly, screens are placed over such openings and if this is done, airflow is reduced by approximately 50%, so the opening area is increased appropriately. The requirement for general ventilation and the requirement for sufficient combustion air are quite different. A typical arrangement might be to make the opening large enough to provide intake air plus 1000 Cubic Feet per Minute (CFM) for additional ventilation.

40|$|The aim of air {{treatment}} {{is to help}} prevent exposure to foreign substances {{in the air at}} the workplace. Measures include, on the one hand, the capture of substances at the point at which they occur or are emitted and, on the other, ventilation through removal or dilution of foreign substances in the air in work areas. These measures are complemented by the treatment of air intake (heating, refrigeration, humidifying, dehumidifying, filtering) and the purification of air expelled as well as the recovery or re-use of the heat. The most significant basis for calculating requirements for {{air treatment}} equipment and equipment components are the currents of air that are required for the capture of substances (capture air current) and for <b>ventilation</b> (air <b>intake</b> currents). The height of the air currents is dependent on a number of factors and must, as a rule, be calculated in each case. VDI guidelines 3929 and 2262 sheet 3 contain directions on calculating capture air currents. The most vital factor to be considered if ventilation is to be effective is the air conduction, in other words it must be determined how air intake is to be distributed throughout the room, taking into account the conditions prevailing within the room and technical factors relating to production. If thermals occur in a factory building or a work-shop, the air intake must be introduced near floor level so as not to interfere with these. There have been and still are many cases of air intake being introduced through the ceiling of the building. This type of air conduction is not, in general, suitable for ventilating factory buildings.

30|$|The adjoint {{method has}} long been {{considered}} as the tool of choice for gradient-based optimisation in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). It is {{the independence of the}} computational cost from the number of design variables that makes it particularly attractive for problems with large design spaces. Originally developed by Lions and Pironneau in the 70 ’s, the adjoint method has evolved towards a standard tool within the development processes of the aeronautical industries. Its uptake in the automotive industry, however, lags behind. The first systematic applications of adjoint methods in automotive CFD have interestingly not taken place in the classical shape design arena, but in a relatively young discipline of sensitivity-based optimisation: fluid dynamic topology optimisation. While being an established concept in structure mechanics for decades already, its transfer to fluid dynamics took place just ten years ago. We demonstrate that specifically for ducted flow applications, like airducts for cabin <b>ventilation</b> or engine <b>intake</b> ports, it constitutes a very powerful tool and has matured over the last years to a level that allows its systematic usage for various automotive applications. To drive adjoint-based shape optimisation to the same degree of maturity and robustness for car applications is the subject of ongoing research collaborations between academia and the car industry.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out {{on the model of}} an {{isolated}} supersonic air-intake to study the effect of natural ventilation of the internal boundary layer on the overall pressure distribution, total pressure recovery, intake buzz oscillations and surfaceflow patterns in the Mach number range of 2 to 3 at design and off-design conditions. The intake was stared in supercritical condition with benign back-pressure condition; the back-pressure was gradually increased using a butterfly valve driven by a PCcontrolled stepper motor. The tests {{were carried out}} at the 0. 3 m supersonic blowdown wind tunnel at the Experimental Aerodynamics Division, NAL, Bangalore. The results show that with ventilation, significant improvement in the total pressure recovery occurs at all back-pressure conditions, with the optimum vent gap of 1. 6 mm indicating improvement in the pressure recovery efficiency from about 60 % to 90 % at Mach 3; improvement was observed at Mach 2 also, though of reduced magnitude. Schlieren visualizations suggest a clear delay in the occurrence of critical condition of the <b>intake.</b> <b>Ventilation</b> created a stable oblique shock at the intake cowl lip, in contrast to the bow-wave without ventilation, indicating reduced spillage and improved pressure recovery of th e entry flow. Image analyses of video pictures suggest a limit-cycle oscillation of the oblique shock just past the critical region. Numerical simulation for some selected cases was carried out with and without ventilation using a CFD code FLUENT. Reasonable agreement with the experimental data was observed...|$|R
40|$|Commuters are {{regularly}} exposed to short-term peak concentration of traffic produced nanoparticles (i. e. particles < 300  nm in size). Studies indicate that these exposures pose {{adverse health effects}} (i. e. cardiovascular). This study aims to obtain particle number concentrations (PNCs) and distributions (PNDs) inside and outside a car cabin whilst driving on a road in Guildford, a typical UK town. Other objectives are to: (i) investigate the influences of particle transformation processes on particle number and size distributions in the cabin, (ii) correlate PNCs inside the cabin to those measured outside, and (iii) predict PNCs in the cabin based on those outside the cabin using a semi-empirical model. A fast response differential mobility spectrometer (DMS 50) was employed in conjunction with an automatic switching system to measure PNCs and PNDs in the 5 – 560  nm range at multiple locations {{inside and outside the}} cabin at 10  Hz sampling rate over 10  s sequential intervals. Two separate sets of measurements were made at: (i) four seats in the car cabin during ∼ 700  min of driving, and (ii) two points, one the driver seat and the other near the <b>ventilation</b> air <b>intake</b> outside the cabin, during ∼ 500  min of driving. Results of the four-point measurements indicated that average PNCs at all for locations were nearly identical (i. e. 3. 96, 3. 85, 3. 82 and 4. 00  ×  104  cm− 3). The modest difference (∼ 0. 1 %) revealed a well-mixed distribution of nanoparticles in the car cabin. Similar magnitude and shapes of PNDs at all four sampling locations suggested that transformation processes (e. g. nucleation, coagulation, condensation) have minimal effect on particles in the cabin. Two-point measurements indicated that on average, PNCs inside the cabin were about 72 % of those measured outside. Time scale analysis indicated that dilution was the fastest and dominant process in the cabin, governing the variations of PNCs in time. A semi-empirical model was proposed to predict PNCs inside the cabin as a function of those measured outside. Performance evaluation of the model against multiple statistical measures was within the recommended guidelines for atmospheric dispersion modelling. Trip average PNCs obtained using the model demonstrate a reasonably good correlation (i. e. R 2  =  0. 97) with measured values...|$|R
40|$|In {{critically}} ill children, optimal energy and protein intakes {{are associated with}} improved prognoses. However, their protein and energy needs have been determined {{on the basis of}} insufficient data. In clinical practice, resting energy expenditure (REE) is frequently estimated from prédictive équations, despite their probable lack of précision, instead of using indirect calorimetry measurements. Thus, the aims of this PhD thesis were twofold: to determine the energy and protein needs in ventilated {{critically ill}} children, and to evaluate available prédictive équations for estimating REE in this population. Our first study was conducted to investigate how much protein and energy are needed to equilibrate the nitrogen and energy balances of ventilated critically ill children on sedation and analgesia. From 402 daily measurements of total urinary nitrogen (TUN) and REE in 74 children, we found that TUN was elevated and REE was reduced during mechanical <b>ventilation.</b> Minimum <b>intakes</b> of 1. 5 g/kg/d of protein and 58 kcal/kg/d were required in children up to 4 years old, whereas older children needed more protein. Our second work aimed to determine, based on our indirect calorimetry measurements, the biases of 15 prédictive équations, including recent équations specifically developed for estimating REE in ventilated critically ill children. Only the six équations of Talbot, Schofield, Henry and Mehta had a bias < 10 % between 200 and 1000 kcal/d, but their précision was still unsatisfactory in young children. Following this work, we made a systematic review of the literature to document validation studies of prédictive équations in critically ill children. Of the 993 studies identified, 22 studies were included and involved 998 critically ill children and 2076 indirect calorimetry measurements. They assessed 21 prédictive équations, but only 6 équations were evaluated by at least three studies. The équation of Harris-Benedict clearly overestimated REE in a large majority of patients and should not be used in this population. The équations of Schofield and the tables of Talbot were the most accurate, but predicted REE within ± 15 % of measured energy expenditure in only 53 % of patients. Other analysed équations were either more imprecise or not assessed in a sufficient number of studies. In conclusion, this project precisely assessed the energy and protein needs of ventilated critically ill children aged 0 to 8 years and showed that most prédictive équations of REE are inaccurate, especially in the youngest children...|$|R
