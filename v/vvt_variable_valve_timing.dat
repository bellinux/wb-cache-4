5000|$|VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control, {{pronounced}} [...] "vee-tech") is {{a system}} developed by Honda to improve the volumetric efficiency of a four-stroke internal combustion engine, resulting in higher performance at high RPM, and lower fuel consumption at low RPM. The VTEC system uses two camshaft profiles and hydraulically selects between profiles. It was invented by Honda engineer Ikuo Kajitani. It is distinctly different from standard <b>VVT</b> (<b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing)</b> which advances the valve timing only and {{does not change the}} camshaft profile or valve lift in any way.|$|E

50|$|The <b>VVT</b> (<b>Variable</b> <b>Valve</b> <b>Timing)</b> {{engine was}} {{unveiled}} in September 2014 with its first application in the Proton Iriz. The VVT engine {{has a new}} block, new pistons and new valves, and incorporates variable valve timing (VVT). However, some technology in the new VVT family is shared with the old CamPro, but due to the various changes and modifications made to the CamPro family over the past decade, Proton {{has decided not to}} use the 'CamPro' nameplate after its 2014 revision. However, older models like the Exora, Prevé and Suprima S will continue to use the old 'CamPro' name until it is eventually retired in favour of the upcoming GDi engines.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, the RAV4 came in base Edge and {{upmarket}} Cruiser {{models in}} both three- and five-door configurations. The main differentiation {{between the two}} models was in appearance. Edge models came with unpainted grey bumpers and side cladding, mirrors, and door handles, and featured steel rims. Cruiser models gained body-coloured (painted) bumpers and moldings, mirrors, and door handles, alloy wheels, and ABS brakes. All models came equipped with a brand-new 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine featuring <b>VVT</b> (<b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing),</b> resulting in improved power and torque, as well as fuel consumption. Permanent all-wheel-drive was a feature. Options were ABS brakes (on the Edge), and air conditioning (on all models). The second generation RAV4 enjoyed success in Australia, where it became the best-selling SUV {{in the country in}} 2001, overtaking its rival, the Honda CR-V, for the first time.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the development of}} a fully continuous, hydraulics-based <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> system. This hydraulics based <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> system is capable of controlling an engine valves lift height and infinitely varying the engine valves lift profile. Along with full valve controllability during normal operation, the <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> system is capable of providing the same operation as a classic cam shaft under engine power loss conditions. This is possible due to the rotating hydraulic spool valves coupled to the engines crank shaft, which are used to actuate the engine poppet valves. The main focus of this thesis is to investigate, alter and implement a new iteration of the hydraulic <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> system on a standalone test bench to validate the systems operating principles. The test bench utilizes servo motors to act as an engines crank shaft which runs the rotating hydraulic spool valves and hydraulic pump. This serves as an intermediate step to full engine implementation of the <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> system. The research begins by analyzing the current mechanical spool valve and hydraulic cylinder design for any potential problems that may occur either during assembly or full operation. The basic system equations are presented to give a glimpse into the working principles of the rotary valves. The mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic subsystems are discussed in terms of what was considered during the design and implementation process. Then design changes that were performed on the rotary valve system to overcome any failures. Lastly the resulting data is presented from the current <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> design to verify proper system functionality...|$|R

50|$|The valves {{within an}} {{internal}} combustion engine are used to control {{the flow of the}} intake and exhaust gases {{into and out of the}} combustion chamber. The timing, duration and lift of these valve events has a significant impact on engine performance. Without <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> or <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> lift, the <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> must be the same for all engine speeds and conditions, therefore compromises are necessary. An engine equipped with a <b>variable</b> <b>valve</b> <b>timing</b> actuation system is freed from this constraint, allowing performance to be improved over the engine operating range.|$|R
