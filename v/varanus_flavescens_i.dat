50|$|<b>Varanus</b> <b>flavescens</b> has subcorneal teeth, {{scarcely}} compressed. Its snout {{is short}} and convex, measuring {{a little less than}} the distance from the anterior border of the orbit to the anterior border of the ear; canthus rostralis distinct. Its nostril an oblique slit, a little nearer {{to the end of the}} snout than to the orbit. Digits short, the length of the fourth toe, measured from its articulation with the tarsus to the base of the claw, not exceeding the length of the femur. The tail of the yellow monitor feebly compressed, keeled above. Scales of head small, subequal; the median series of supraocular scales slightly dilated transversely. Scales on upper surfaces moderate, oval, keeled. Abdominal scales smooth, in 65 to 75 transverse rows. Caudal scales keeled; the caudal keel with a very low, doubly toothed crest. Olive or yellowish brown above, with irregular darker markings which are generally confluent into broad cross bars; a blackish temporal streak; lower surfaces yellowish, with rather indistinct brown cross bars, which are most distinct on the throat. Young dark brown above, with yellow spots confluent into crossbars; lower surface yellow, with dark brown cross bars.==Population== The actual population or population trends is unknown. However, it is considered that the species has low population density even in its preferred habitat. Limited studies suggest that the species is decreasing, however more studies required to confirm actual trend of the species.|$|R

40|$|A {{potential}} microhabitat is {{very important}} for the survival and successful reproduction of any wildlife species. In this study we assessed the microhabitat characteristics of <b>Varanus</b> <b>flavescens</b> in the human altered ecosystems of Chalan beel area, Baraigram, Natore by flowing the Visual Encounter Survey method and by using several important material. A semi-aquatic microhabitat of canal and river was preferred by the species as compared to other identified microhabitats. The slow moving water of the river and canal was fresh and somewhat cloudy in character but stagnant water of the pond and beel (floodplain) was semitransparent having lots of phytoplankton and zooplankton. The soil was mostly silty clay. As the study species is cold blooded, the environmental variables like soil, air and water temperatures inside and outside of the microhabitat play major roles for their activity patterns. In order to regulate their body temperature, during a hot sunny day they were more active within the shady area of the microhabitats but at dawn and dusk they were more seen in the sunny areas where temperature was relatively higher. In winter months, the monitor lizards were almost inactive. During that time of the year they live inside the burrow to avoid the extreme cold and foggy weather but during heavy sunshine they come outside of the hole for thermoregulation purpose for a certain time. We noticed that extensive agricultural practice and the excessive use of insecticides may be having a detrimental effect on the microhabitat features important to this semiaquatic lizard. Still the study species is more seen in the human altered ecosystems of Bangladesh. So, to ensure their existence in our close proximity there is an urgent need to create consciousness of the people regarding this beneficial non-venomous species and their respective microhabitat...|$|R
25|$|Iris grow well in {{most any}} garden soil types {{providing}} they are well-drained. The earliest to bloom are species like I. junonia and I. reichenbachii, which flower {{as early as}} February and March in the Northern Hemisphere, followed by the dwarf forms of I. pumila, and then {{by most of the}} tall bearded varieties, such as the German Iris and its variety florentina, Sweet Iris, Hungarian Iris, Lemon-yellow Iris (<b>I.</b> <b>flavescens),</b> Iris sambucina, <b>I.</b> amoena, and their natural and horticultural hybrids such as those described under names like I. neglecta or I. squalens and best united under I. × lurida.|$|R
40|$|Photoperiodism {{involves}} the use of both absolute measures of day length and the direction in which day length is changing as a cue for regulating seasonal changes in physiology and behaviour so that birth and lactation coincide with optimal resource availability, increasing offspring survival. Induced ovulation and opportunistic breeding is often found in species that are predominantly solitary and territorial. In this study, the photoperiodic reproductive responses of male greater red musk shrews (Crocidura <b>flavescens</b> (<b>I.</b> Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1827)) were investigated in the laboratory. The presence of spermatozoa regardless of the light cycle, suggest that although the shrews are photoresponsive, they may be capable of breeding throughout the year. Significantly greater testicular volume and seminiferous tubule diameter following exposure to a short day-light cycle suggests that these animals may have breeding peaks that correspond to short days. The presence of epidermal spines on the penis indicates that the shrew is likely also an induced ovulator. Flexible breeding patterns combined with induced ovulation affords this solitary species the greatest chance of reproductive success. National Research Foundation (NRF; GUN 64756).

40|$|Polygala is {{the largest}} genus of Polygalaceae, {{comprising}} about 350 species (one third of the entire family), including trees, shrubs and herbs distributed throughout the world (1). In Italy, this genus is composed only of herbaceous plants, with {{a significant number of}} specific and subspecific taxa endemic to the country (2). Among them, there is Polygala flavescens DC., the only Italian species with yellow flowers, whose geographical distribution is ranging from Liguria to Basilicata, across Italian peninsula. Very recently, three subspecies were recognised within P. flavescens, based on qualitative morphological characters (3) : P. flavescens subsp. flavescens (covering most of the geographic range of the species), P. flavescens subsp. maremmana (Fiori) Arrigoni (with range limited to the coastal portion of Tuscany), and P. flavescens subsp. pisaurensis (Caldesi) Arrigoni (with range limited to the coastal portion of Emilia-Romagna and Marche). The latter taxon was considered as a distinct species, for a long time (4). In order to contribute to the systematics and correct taxonomic setting of these taxa, a chemotaxonomic study was carried out. To this aim, we selected five different populations: three of P. <b>flavescens</b> subsp. <b>flavescens</b> (<b>i.</b> e. the species with the largest range), collected in Tuscany (PFF-T), Molise (PFF-M) and Abruzzo (PFF-A); P. flavescens subsp. maremmana collected at Monte Argentario (PFM), and P. flavescens subsp. pisaurensis collected at Fano (PFP), i. e. the areas from which they were originally described (loci classici). Aerial parts were dried, defatted with n-hexane, and extracted at room temperature with methanol. Each MeOH extract was partitioned between n-BuOH and H 2 O and the n-BuOH soluble fraction was subjected to LC-PDA-ESIMS and LC-PDA-ESIMS/MS analyses, in order to compare the chromatographic profile and provide wider information concerning the secondary metabolites contents. A preliminary qualitative analysis showed that all plants displayed an identical flavonoid and oligosaccharide pattern, while the profile of saponins showed little differences among the five populations. Then, a more in-depth chemical study was carried out on the selected population PFF-T collected in the highest amount. PFF-T n-BuOH extract was so separated by Sephadex LH- 20 followed by CPC and RP-HPLC. Flavonoids and oligosaccharide esters, including some new compounds, were purified and fully characterized by spectroscopic techniques such as 1 D and 2 D-NMR, and mass spectrometry. Results were in agreements with those reported in the literature for other Polygala species, being flavonoids, oligosaccharides, and saponins widely distributed in the genus (5, 6). In addition, also the volatile profile of fresh flowers was compared among populations, by means of Head Space-Solid Phase Micro Extraction (HS-SPME) technique (7). The captured volatile organic compounds were then characterized by GC-MS and a Multivariate Statistical Analysis was carried out. According to the SPME emission pattern, the most similar ones resulted PFF-M and PFP that formed a cluster in the HCA dendrogram. Another cluster was provided by the three remaining ones, with PFF-A and PFM more similar each other than PFF-T. The PCA confirmed this behavior. The solitary placement of PFF-T is due to its high production of cis-α-ambrinol and the exclusive emission of caryophyllene oxide and dendrolasin...|$|R
