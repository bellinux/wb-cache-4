5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, American musical theater {{was a major}} source for popular songs, many of which {{influenced}} blues, jazz, country, and other extant styles of popular music. The center of development for this style was in New York City, where the Broadway theatres became among the most renowned venues in the city. Theatrical composers and lyricists like the brothers George and Ira Gershwin created a uniquely American theatrical style that used American <b>vernacular</b> <b>speech</b> and music. Musicals featured popular songs and fast-paced plots that often revolved around love and romance.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} loanwords for food dishes and their {{ingredients}} are Hokkien in origin, {{and are used}} throughout the Indonesian language and <b>vernacular</b> <b>speech</b> of large cities. Because they have {{become an integral part}} of the local language, many Indonesians and ethnic Chinese do not recognize their Hokkien origins. Some popular Indonesian dishes such as nasi goreng, lumpia, and bakpia can trace their origin to Chinese influence. Some food and ingredients are part of the daily diet of both the indigenous and ethnic Chinese populations as side dishes to accompany rice, the staple food of most of the country. Among ethnic Chinese families, both peranakan and totok, pork is generally preferred as meat; this is in contrast with traditional Indonesian cuisine, which in majority-Muslim areas avoids the meat. The consumption of pork has, however, decreased in recent years owing to a recognition of its contribution to health hazards such as high cholesterol levels and heart disease.|$|E

5000|$|Paradoxically, Inochentism {{had most}} impact among Romanian-speaking peasants, {{as noted by}} Popovschi: [...] "Even in cases where a village was {{inhabited}} by Romanians and foreigners ..., only the Romanians would adhere to Inochentism. In those Bessarabian counties were the population was of a different nationality, Inochentism found no adherents." [...] The replacement of Slavonic sermons with <b>vernacular</b> <b>speeches</b> gave the movement a boost and formed part of its culture. Ethnographer Dorin Lozovanu assessed that Inochentism itself was a grassroots form of Romanian cultural emancipation, offering a venue for Romanian speakers throughout southwestern Russian and Soviet lands. Lozovanu interviewed old Inochentists in Balta, who spoke the Moldavian dialect and refused to apply for Ukrainian citizenship.|$|R
25|$|The core of Eisa {{consists}} of nembutsu songs. The Ryūkyū-koku yuraiki (1713) attributes {{the introduction of}} nembutsu to Taichū (1552–1639), a Jōdo sect monk from Mutsu Province. According to the record, he translated Buddhist teaching into the <b>vernacular</b> <b>speech</b> and taught {{it to the people}} of Naha during the reign of Shō Nei. Other sources confirm that Taichū stayed in the capital region for three years in the early 1600s and converted the king and other high-ranking officials. Some researchers speculate that he introduced odori nembutsu or dancing nembutsu to Naha. However, Taichū's teaching did not prevail; it was barely carried on by his followers in Kakinohana, Naha.|$|E

2500|$|In some Alaskan Native communities, {{the spiritual}} people {{have used a}} {{distinctly}} archaic version of the community's normal language interlaced with special metaphors and speech styles. For example, [...] "the shadow is ripening" [...] means the healer is returning from his spiritual journey during a [...] "seance". Expert healers have been said to speak whole sentences differing from <b>vernacular</b> <b>speech.</b> The shamans among the Siberian Yupik peoples had a special language that used periphrastic substitutions for names of objects and phenomena; they used it for conversation with the [...] (spirits). These spirits were believed {{to have a special}} language with certain substitutes for ordinary words (“the one with a drum”: [...] "shaman"; “that with tusks”: [...] "walrus"). The Ungazighmiit (a Siberian Yupik people) had a special allegoric usage of some expressions.|$|E

Lexically, Islamic-Oriental loanwords are more frequent; phonetically: the phoneme /x/ (letter h) is reinstated in many words as a distinct feature of <b>vernacular</b> Bosniak <b>speech</b> and language tradition; also, there are some changes in grammar, morphology and orthography that reflect the Bosniak pre-World War I literary tradition, mainly that of the Bosniak renaissance {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century.|$|R
2500|$|Modern {{linguistics}} {{has come}} to call the resulting variety [...] "Standard Modern Greek" [...] to distinguish it from the pure original Demotic of earlier literature and traditional <b>vernacular</b> <b>speech.</b> Greek authors sometimes use the term [...] "Modern Greek Koiné" [...] (Νεοελληνική Κοινή Neoellinikí Koiní, literally 'Common Modern Greek'), reviving the term koiné that otherwise refers to the [...] "common" [...] form of post-classical Ancient Greek; according to these scholars, Modern Greek Koiné is the [...] "supra-dialect product of the composition of both the Demotic and Katharevousa." [...] Indeed, Standard Modern Greek has incorporated {{a large amount of}} vocabulary from the learned tradition, especially through the registers of academic discourse, politics, technology and religion; together with these, it has incorporated a number of morphological features associated with their inflectional paradigms, as well as some phonological features not originally found in pure Demotic.|$|E
2500|$|Bishops were at {{the head}} of the local church; but not {{explicitly}} within the cursus honorum, as appointment was by election from the local clergy and people. [...] Not surprisingly, the clergy tended to favour appointment of bishops from within the ranks of cathedral presbyters; but local lay choice often tended rather to outsiders, either a spectacular holy man, hermit or ascetic; or otherwise a senior civil servant or diplomat, who might have favourable contacts to exploit at court. [...] But most bishops came from the curial class, that is those holding the hereditary rank of decurion with the obligation to serve on the city council, as only persons of this class and above would be likely to have a full rhetorical education in Greek and Latin grammar; without which it was not possible for a boy raised with a knowledge only of Late Antique <b>vernacular</b> <b>speech</b> to express himself in approved classical linguistic forms.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{linguists}} {{believe that}} Old English received little influence {{from the local}} insular languages especially Common Brittonic (the language {{that may have been}} the majority language in Lowland Britain). Linguists such as Richard Coates have suggested there could not have been meaningful contact between the languages, which is reasonable argued from the small amount of loanwords. Recently a number of linguists have argued that many of the grammar changes observed in English were due to a Brythonic influence. John McWhorter suggests that the language changes seen later in English were always there in <b>vernacular</b> <b>speech</b> and this was not written, especially since those who did the writing were educated individuals that most likely spoke a standard form of Old English. The speech of an illiterate ceorl, on the other hand, can not be reconstructed. The progressive nature of this language acquisition, and the 'retrospective reworking' of kinship ties to the dominant group led, ultimately, to the [...] "myths which tied the entire society to immigration as an explanation of their origins in Britain".|$|E

Another popular stereotype from this era was the black who is scared of ghosts (and usually turns white out of fear). Children are often pickaninnies like Little Black Sambo and Golliwog.

5000|$|Such vowel {{reduction}} {{is one of}} the sources of distinction between a spoken language and its written counterpart. <b>Vernacular</b> and formal <b>speech</b> often have different levels of vowel reduction, and so the term [...] "vowel reduction" [...] is also applied to differences in a language variety with respect to, e.g., the language standard.|$|R

" "The volume offers a general introduction to the history of 'vernacular' and 'vulgar' dictionaries, including the lexicography of Cantonese; the sociopolitical and linguistic background to Hong Kong; and the specific problems of approach and methodology faced by the linguist as urban anthropologist in researching such issues. The Dictionary itself offers for the first time a survey of the commonest slang and colloquial phrases used in Hong Kong, including taboo language not hitherto included in any dictionary. The aim is to allow diverse groups of people interested in Hong Kong society and culture access to an authoritative guide to non-standard Cantonese. It is Cantonese-English, arranged alphabetically according to a widely-used transcription system. The Dictionary provides concise definitions and examples of usage where appropriate. A character list enables readers unfamiliar with Chinese transcription systems to use the text...|$|R
