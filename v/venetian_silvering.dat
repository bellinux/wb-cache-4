5000|$|The <b>Venetian</b> <b>silver</b> {{trade was}} greatly {{affected}} by the Bullion Famine. Normally, silver produced in mines in Central Europe and the Balkans flowed through Venetian ports, to be traded with merchants for Eastern goods. The <b>Venetian</b> export of <b>silver</b> to the East increased {{at a rate of}} over 20 tons per year in the 1420s. Apparently at this point, only Bosnian silver was able {{to make up for the}} scarcity of silver in Europe. In the 15th century, Venetian ships that went to Alexandria or the Black Sea ports for exchange often brought with them gold and silver coins and bullion worth approximately 100,000 ducats.|$|R
5000|$|The basilikon was {{introduced}} shortly before 1304 by Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282-1328), in direct {{imitation of the}} <b>Venetian</b> <b>silver</b> ducat or grosso, chiefly to pay the mercenaries of the Catalan Company. The Byzantine coin closely followed the iconography of the Venetian model, with a seated Christ on the obverse and the two standing figures of Andronikos II and his son and co-emperor Michael IX Palaiologos (r. 1294-1320) replacing St. Mark and the Doge of Venice on the reverse. The similarity was reinforced {{by the name of}} the new coin: the ducato, the [...] "coin of the doge", became the basilikon, the [...] "coin of the basileus", although the contemporary Greek sources usually call both doukaton.|$|R

5000|$|The stavraton was {{complemented by}} {{fractions}} of 1⁄2 and 1⁄8, both in silver. The half-stavraton initially weighed 4.4 grams and gradually declined to 3.7; the one-eighth, {{known as the}} doukatopoulon (Greek: δουκατόπουλον, [...] "little ducat", duchatelo in Italian sources) or aspron (...) weighed circa 1.1 grams. Quarter-stavrata were not minted, and the <b>silver</b> <b>Venetian</b> ducats (Greek: δουκάτον, doukaton) were used instead.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was said}} that the total amount looted from Constantinople was about 900,000 silver marks, or 600,000 troy pounds. [...] The <b>Venetians</b> {{received}} 150,000 <b>silver</b> marks that was their due and the Crusaders received 50,000 silver marks. A further 100,000 silver marks were divided evenly between the Crusaders and Venetians. The remaining 500,000 silver marks were secretly kept back by many Crusader knights. Meanwhile, Latin residents of Constantinople exacted their own retribution for the Massacre of the Latins of 1182.|$|R

In France, in April 2011, the Minister of Culture Frédéric Mitterrand awarded him the title of Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters. In Italy, in June 2011, President Giorgio Napolitano awarded him the title of Chevalier of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.|$|R
50|$|After the Fourth Crusade (1204) and {{the fall}} of Byzantium in the Hellenic area, Crete was given to Bonifacio, Marquess of Montferrat. He in turn chose {{to sell it to}} the <b>Venetians</b> for 100 <b>silver</b> marks. In 1252 the Venetians managed to subdue the Cretans but in 1263, their rivals of Genoa, with local support, seized the city under the {{leadership}} of Enrico Pescatore, count of Malta, and held it until 1285, when the Venetians returned. Chania was chosen as the seat of the Rector (Administrator General) of the region and flourished as a significant commercial centre of a fertile agricultural region.|$|R
50|$|The crusaders sacked Constantinople {{for three}} days, during which many ancient Greco-Roman and medieval Byzantine {{works of art}} were stolen or ruined. Many of the {{civilian}} population of the city were killed and their property looted. Despite the threat of excommunication, the crusaders destroyed, defiled and looted the city's churches and monasteries. It was said that the total amount looted from Constantinople was about 900,000 <b>silver</b> marks. The <b>Venetians</b> received 150,000 <b>silver</b> marks that was their due, while the crusaders received 50,000 silver marks. A further 100,000 silver marks were divided evenly up between the crusaders and Venetians. The remaining 500,000 silver marks were secretly kept back by many crusader knights.|$|R
25|$|The Fourth Crusade in {{agreement}} for funds attempted {{to help the}} deposed emperor Alexius IV regain his throne. After taking Constantinople, returning Alexius IV to the throne, the revolt against and death of Alexius IV, the Crusaders were left without payment. On 12 April 1204, the crusaders inflicted a severe sacking on Constantinople for three days, during which many ancient and medieval Roman and Greek works were either stolen or destroyed. Despite their oaths {{and the threat of}} excommunication, the Crusaders ruthlessly and systematically violated the city's holy sanctuaries, destroying, defiling, or stealing all they could lay hands on; nothing was spared. It was said that the total amount looted from Constantinople was about 900,000 <b>silver</b> marks. The <b>Venetians</b> received 150,000 <b>silver</b> marks that was their due, while the Crusaders received 50,000 silver marks. A further 100,000 silver marks were divided evenly up between the Crusaders and Venetians. The remaining 500,000 silver marks were secretly kept back by many Crusader knights.|$|R
50|$|Boniface of Montferrat, meanwhile, {{had left}} the fleet before it sailed from Venice, to visit his cousin Philip of Swabia. The reasons for his visit are a matter of debate; he may have {{realized}} the Venetians' plans and left to avoid excommunication, or he may have wanted {{to meet with the}} Byzantine prince Alexios IV Angelos, Philip's brother-in-law and the son of the recently deposed Byzantine emperor Isaac II Angelos. Alexios IV had recently fled to Philip in 1201 but it is unknown whether or not Boniface knew he was at Philip's court. There, Alexios IV offered to pay the entire debt owed to the <b>Venetians,</b> give 200,000 <b>silver</b> marks to the crusaders, 10,000 Byzantine professional troops for the Crusade, the maintenance of 500 knights in the Holy Land, the service of the Byzantine navy to transport the Crusader Army to Egypt, and the placement of the Eastern Orthodox Church under the authority of the Pope, if they would sail to Byzantium and topple the reigning emperor Alexios III Angelos, brother of Isaac II. This tempting offer, for an enterprise that was short on funds, reached the leaders of the Crusade on 1 January 1203 as they wintered at Zara. Doge Dandolo was a fierce supporter of the plan; however, in his earlier capacity as an ambassador to Byzantium and someone who knew the finer details of how Byzantine politics worked, it is likely he knew the promises were false and there was no hope of any Byzantine emperor raising the money promised, let alone raising the troops and giving the church to the Holy See. Count Boniface agreed and Alexios IV returned with the Marquess to rejoin the fleet at Corfu after it had sailed from Zara. Most {{of the rest of the}} crusade's leaders, encouraged by bribes from Dandolo, eventually accepted the plan as well. However, there were dissenters. Led by Reynold of Montmirail, those who refused to take part in the scheme to attack Constantinople sailed on to Syria. The remaining fleet of 60 war galleys, 100 horse transports, and 50 large transports (the entire fleet was manned by 10,000 Venetian oarsmen and marines) sailed in late April 1203. In addition, 300 siege engines were brought along on board the fleet. Hearing of their decision, the Pope hedged and issued an order against any more attacks on Christians unless they were actively hindering the Crusader cause, but he did not condemn the scheme outright.|$|R

Nadalje, na osnovi poznatih povijesnihdogađanja na tom prostoru, predlažu se vremenski isječci u kojima se moglo dogoditi deponiranjeove ostaveTurska Peć cave is {{situated}} above the hamlet of Zeljovići {{at the height}} of about 355 metres abovesea level, above present-day village of Sumpetar, Dugi Rat County (picture 1). In 1989 a smaller scaleresearch has been made in that object. The excavated material showed that this was a prehistoric sitethat had been occupied in early and late Neolithic. In the year of 2003 the Archaeological Museum in Split started with the systematic archaeologicalresearch in this cave, and held two campaigns (2003 and 2005). At first two coins, and later 107 coinswere found in {{the last days of the}} research of the first campaign, in the soil from the eastern profile ofthe Probe 1 (picture 5). Substantial devastations happened in 2004 in the cave, especially in the Probe 1 at the east side where in January 2005 the following 107 coins were found in the collapsed parts ofthe probe. So far we can state that a hoard exists in the Turska peć cave and it consist of 216 coins. 154 examples have been typologically analysed. The rest of the examples were so glued togetherthat they could not be separated. The hoard of Turska peć consists of the coins of the cities of Verona– 1 example, Venice – 8 examples and Split – 145 examples (graph 1). The earliest examples coming from this hoard (cat. no. 1 - 8) belong to the <b>Venetian</b> <b>silver</b> denarithat were minted in Venice at the period of Dukes Orio Malipiero (1178 – 1192) and Enrico Dandolo(1192 – 1205). Other examples of the coins belonging to these dukes come from the hoards fromČiovo, Trilj and Nerežišća. Next in time-scale is a silver denar of the city of Verona (cat. no. 9). These coins were mintedduring the rule of the emperor Friedrich II of Schwabia (1218 – 1250). Other examples of these coinswere preserved in the hoards from Trilj and Nerežišća. The largest number of remaining coins belongs to the ones minted in Split (cat. no. 10 - 154). Typological analysis is based upon the typology created by G. Stockert (graph 2). TYPE II, GROUP B: 98 examples (67 % of the total sum) of the remaining coins from Split belong to this group. Accordingto the reverse of the coins of this group, I have divided them into two variants. The first variantconsists of 66 examples (cat. no. 10 – 75). The second variant consists of 30 examples (cat. no. 76 – 107). Examples of the coins of B group were found in hoards on Čiovo, in Trilj and Nerežišća. TYPE II, GROUP C:This group is represented within our hoard with 9 examples (cat. no. 108 – 116), that is 6 % of the totalsum. Analogies have been preserved in the hoards from Čiovo and Nerežišća. TYPE II, GROUP D:Only 3 examples from our hoard belong to this group that is only 2 % out of total sum. It is interestingthat each example represents different variant within this group (cat. no. 117 – 119). As analogiesexamples from the hoards from Čiovo and Nerežišća should be mentioned. TYPE II, GROUP E:This group is represented by 3 examples from our hoard, or 2 % of the total sum (cat. no. 120 - 122). Similar examples have been found in the hoards from Čiovo and Nerežišća. TYPE II, GROUP F:This group is represented with 8 examples divided into two variants that make 6 % of the total sum(cat. no. 123 – 130). The analogous examples come from the hoards from Žažvić near Skradin andfrom Čiovo and Nerežišća. TYPE II, GROUP G:Group G is represented in our hoard with 24 examples divided into two variants, that makes 17 % ofthe total sum (cat. no. 131 – 154). The analogous examples to this group were found in the hoardsfrom Žažvić near Skradin, and from Čiovo and Nerežišća. Information about the earliest distribution and minting of the Split medieval coins of type I areconnected to the fist half of the 13 th century (1237 – 1247), according to the archives used by G. Novak in his book „The History of Split“. The archive documents from the same source confirm theminting of Split coins of type I also in the period from 1258 to 1266. According to the majority of the authors, coins of type II started to be minted by the end of the 13 th century. At the same time type I was still minted and used. Furthermore, the authors believethat the coins of type III and IV appeared in Split at the beginning of the 14 th century. None of theauthors states the opinion whether the type II coins were still minted in that period, but accordingto the hoards from Trilj and Nerežišća this type was certainly used as a legal tender. The examples ofthe coins of type I-II have been better preserved compared to the types III – IV. Therefore, I believethat coins of the type I-II was simultaneously minted with the types III-IV in Split in the beginning ofthe 14 th century. Split statute dates from that period (1312) and it states through numerous laws theusage of coins that were minted in Split. From 1327 to 1357 Split was under the Venetian rule. Most of the authors believe that coins oftype V were minted in that period. I believe that, because of the number of preserved coins of type V,at that period as far as Split denari are concerned, types I-II,V were most commonly used. Hoards fromTrilj and Nerežišća lead to that conclusion. Present-day situation leads to the belief that Split denariwere minted in Split at that time of Venetian government, and not only coins of type V. According to the records of the Great Council assembly for the 1357 – 1384 period, Split denariare mentioned again, therefore they were minted in Split. I believe this is also type II in question,but we also have to take into consideration types I, III – V. According to the aforementioned, coins oftype II were probably minted in Split as late as the second half of the 14 th century. This situation isconfirmed by hoards from Trilj and Nerežišća. The authors agree that the next money to be minted in Split was the one belonging to DukeHrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić who had minted several emissions of his coinage from 1403 to 1413. Theauthors do not state that any kind of coinage was minted between 1357 and 1403. Which coinswere used at that period as a legal tender? I am inclined to believe that those were the coins of typeI-V, especially type I-II and V that could have been minted in Split until the end of the 14 th and thebeginning of 15 th century. The existing archive material that mentions the same supports this. Duke Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić minted his coins in Split from 1403 to 1413 (types VI-VIII). I aminclined to believe that besides Hrvoje’s coins, the same coins of type I-V were minted, especially typeI-II and V. In the year of 1420 Split was under the Venetian rule. Most of the authors believe that Venicestarted minting types IX-X in Venice only in 1491. No one is asking question about which coinswere minted, or which were used until 1491. It is important to note that the county of Split askedVenice for permission to mint lower value coins (probably split denari) because of the shortage ofthe same coins. Venetian government had decided in 1491, 1497 and 1518 to allow minting of Splitcoins – bagatin in Split itself. So which coins of lower value were used in Split until 1491 and slowlydisappeared from circulation? The idea that it were Split denary of type I-V suggests itself. If they werenot minted in Split at that time, they were definitely used as a legal tender until 1491. According to the historic data the most probable scenario is that the depositing of the coinshappened because of some danger, most probably war. Time intervals in which depositing couldhave happened are as follows: 1252; 1287 - 1290; 1322 - 1327; 1387 - 1390; 1401 - 1402; 1411 - 1412; 1416 - 1420. We can conclude that our hoard from Turska peć was probably deposited in the ground between 1252 and 1491. The exact time when that happened we cannot say with certainty...|$|R

Na antičku vilu rusticu, koja je bila u privrednoj funkciji unutar porečkog agera, sjela je kasnoantička kula i dijelom iskoristila zidove ranije faze, a najočitiji ostaci kasnoantičkog doba su gljivasti otvor i crkva do kule. Srednjovjekovni dio se očituje u pronalascima pleterne ornamentike, stupića prozorskih otvora i ziđa. Radovima u 2008. godini definirani su prije otkriveni dijelovi zidova kule, a unutar jedne srednjovjekovne nadogradnje otkriven je sloj prve polovine 14. stoljeća, datiran mletačkom novcem i staklenim inventarom. Archaeological rescue {{excavations}} at the St Blek site engendered a {{new understanding}} of the previously defined construction complex, with three main stages of living. A tower was constructed in Late Antiquity atop a villa rustica from an earlier period of Antiquity in the Poreč ager. The tower partially used the walls from the earlier stage. The most obvious remains of Late Antiquity are a mushroom-shaped door and the church near the tower. The medieval portion is evident in finds of braidwork ornaments, pillars in window openings and the walls. In excavations conducted in 2008, the previously uncovered parts of the tower walls were defined. On the northern side of the northern wall, in the immediate vicinity of the eastern doors with a mushroom-shaped door, the remains of two stairs were discovered that led to the tower’s upper floors (Fig. 1). Along {{the northern part of the}} stairs, a part of the wall was preserved. It was made of the same yellowish mortar as the stairs, as well as dressed stone. This kind of mortar has not been identified on the walls of this structure, and the steps were built in a separate construction phase. It is precisely into these stairs that the pillar from the church was built. As the stairs commence precisely from the mushroom-shaped door, it is assumed that the door functioned at that time. Apart from defining the single wall sections that were not clear from before, in the room in the western side of the northern tower wall (Cuscito, Riavez 2008, 731, Plate 1. No. 5) a layer (Fig. 2) was found in which four <b>silver</b> <b>Venetian</b> coins from the second half of the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries were found. These are the denari (piccolo o denaro scodellato) of three doges: Lorenzo Tiepolo (1268 - 1275), Giovanni Dandolo (1280 - 1289), two pieces, and Pietro Gradenigo (1289 - 1311). In the same layer, the remains of several glass bottles were unearthed, mostly bottles and glasses that – based on their shapes – belong to the fourteenth century, and are probably of Venetian origin. The bottle’s necks were preserved with a discoid extension in the middle of the necks and with rims outward (Fig. 3). The bottoms are inverted in the shape of a cone, with ring-shaped rims (Fig. 4). The middles of the glass bottoms are conically imprinted. The walls of beakers are straight or spirally ribbed. Some are decorated by a blue thread on the edge. Such glasses are a standard product of the late thirteenth century and the entire fifteenth century (Lazar 2003, 81). Also interesting are the broad necks of vessels with a broadly and flatly inverted rim made of colourless glass, which may be defined as urological vessels (urinals). These vessels were used from the thirteenth to seventeenth centuries for medical purposes. The finds from this layer are the first genuine experience of fourteenth century life and economy at the site. The coins and glass suggest that a richer class lived in the tower, since in the fourteenth century glass was a luxury good. Thus, Stari Tar (Old Tar), functioned simultaneously with the Novi Tar (New Tar), and probably at this time the administrator of this part of the Poreč region lived in the Stari Tar tower...|$|R
