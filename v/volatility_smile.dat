Given a specific option, the strike is fixed, and different spots yield the moneyness of that option at different market prices; this is useful in option pricing and understanding the Black–Scholes formula. Conversely, given market data at a given point in time, the spot is fixed at the current market price, while different options have different strikes, and hence different moneyness; this is useful in constructing an implied volatility surface, or more simply plotting a <b>volatility</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E

We illustrate our idea in a jump-diffusion framework where both the diffusion and the jumps are decomposed into common and idiosyncratic components.

5000|$|Graphing implied volatilities against strike {{prices for}} a given expiry yields a skewed [...] "smile" [...] instead of the {{expected}} flat surface. The pattern differs across various markets. Equity options traded in American markets did not show a <b>volatility</b> <b>smile</b> before the Crash of 1987 but began showing one afterwards. It is believed that investor reassessments of the probabilities of fat-tail have led to higher prices for out-the-money options. This anomaly implies deficiencies in the standard Black-Scholes option pricing model which assumes constant volatility and log-normal distributions of underlying asset returns. Empirical asset returns distributions, however, tend to exhibit fat-tails (kurtosis) and skew. Modelling the <b>volatility</b> <b>smile</b> is an active area of research in quantitative finance, and better pricing models such as the stochastic volatility model partially address this issue.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate and model the characteristics of the prevailing <b>volatility</b> <b>smiles</b> and surfaces on the DAX- and ESX-index options markets. Continuing on the trend of Implied Volatility Functions, the Standardized Log-Moneyness model is introduced and fitted to historical data. The model replaces the constant volatility parameter of the Black & Scholes pricing model with a matrix of volatilities with respect to moneyness and maturity and is tested out-of-sample. Considering the dynamics, the results show support for the hypotheses put forward in this study, implying that the smile increases in magnitude when maturity and ATM volatility decreases and that there is a negative/positive correlation between a change in the underlying asset/time to maturity and implied ATM volatility. Further, the Standardized Log-Moneyness model indicates an improvement to pricing accuracy compared to previous Implied Volatility Function models, however indicating that the parameters of the models are to be re-estimated continuously for the models to fully capture the changing dynamics of the <b>volatility</b> <b>smiles...</b>|$|R

Using transaction data for exchange-traded EuroStoxx 50 options from 2000 to 2011 and DAX options from 1995 to 2011, we show that, on average, about 99 % of the intraday variation of implied volatility can be explained by moneyness and changes in the index level. Compared to the typical smile regression with moneyness alone, about 50 % of the remaining errors can be attributed to movements in the underlying index. We find that the intraday evolution of <b>volatility</b> <b>smiles</b> is generally not consistent with traders' rules of thumb such as the sticky strike or sticky delta rule. On average, the impact of index return on implied volatility is 1. 3 to 1. 5 times stronger than the sticky strike rule predicts.
