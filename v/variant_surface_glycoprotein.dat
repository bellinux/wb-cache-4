50|$|African trypanosomes are parasites {{that are}} able to escape the immune {{responses}} of its host animal through a range of mechanisms. Its most prevalent mechanism is its ability to evade recognition by antibodies through antigenic variation. This is achieved through the switching of its <b>variant</b> <b>surface</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> or VSG, a substance that coats the entire antigen. When this coat is recognized by an antibody, the parasite can be cleared. However, variation of this coat can lead to antibodies being unable to recognize and clear the antigen.

50|$|Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense {{relies on}} a {{different}} mechanism of resistance: the serum resistance associated protein (SRA). The SRA gene is a truncated version of the major and variable surface antigen of the parasite, the <b>variant</b> <b>surface</b> <b>glycoprotein.</b> It has a low sequence homology with the VSGc (<25%). SRA is an expression site associated gene in T. b. rhodesiense and is located upstream of the VSGs in the active telomeric expression site. The protein is largely localized to small cytoplasmic vesicles between the flagellar pocket and the nucleus. In T. b. rhodesiense the TLF is directed to SRA containing endosomes while some dispute remain on its presence in the lysosome. SRA binds to ApoL1 using a coiled-coiled interaction at the ApoL1 SRA interacting domain while within the trypanosome lysosome. This interaction prevents {{the release of the}} ApoL1 protein and the subsequent lysis of the lysosome and death of the parasite.|$|E
5000|$|The {{surface of}} the {{trypanosome}} is covered by a dense coat of ~5 x 106 molecules of <b>variant</b> <b>surface</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> (VSG). This coat enables an infecting T. brucei population to persistently evade the host's immune system, allowing chronic infection. VSG is highly immunogenic, and an immune response raised against a specific VSG coat rapidly kills trypanosomes expressing this variant. Antibody-mediated trypanosome killing can also be observed in vitro by a complement-mediated lysis assay. However, with each cell division {{there is a possibility}} that one or both of the progeny will switch expression to change the VSG that is being expressed. The frequency of VSG switching has been measured to be approximately 0.1% per division. [...] As T. brucei populations can peak at a size of 1011 within a host [...] this rapid rate of switching ensures that the parasite population is typically highly diverse. Because host immunity against a specific VSG does not develop immediately, some parasites will have switched to an antigenically-distinct VSG variant, and can go on to multiply and continue the infection. The clinical effect of this cycle is successive 'waves' of parasitemia (trypanosomes in the blood).|$|E

50|$|<b>Variant</b> <b>surface</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> (VSG) is a ~60kDa protein which densely packs {{the cell}} surface of {{protozoan}} parasites {{belonging to the}} genus Trypanosoma. They form a 12-15 nm surface coat and were first isolated from Trypanosoma brucei in 1975 by George Cross. VSG allows the trypanosomatid parasites to evade the mammalian host's immune system by extensive antigenic variation. VSG has no prescribed biochemical activity. The parasite has a large cellular repertoire of antigenically distinct VSGs (~1500 complete and partial (pseudogenes)) located in telomeric and subtelomeric arrays (on megabase chromosomes or minichromosomes). VSGs are expressed from a bloodstream expression site (BES, ES) in a polycistron by RNA polymerase I (recruited to a ribosomal-type promoter) with other ES-associated genes (ESAGs), of which transferrin receptor (Tfr: ESAG6, ESAG7) is one. Only one VSG gene is expressed at a time, as {{only one of the}} ~15 ES are active in a cell. VSG expression is 'switched' by homologous recombination of a silent basic copy gene from an array (directed by homology) into the active telomerically-located expression site. Interestingly, mosaic VSG genes can be created by homologous recombination of a partial VSG gene from an array. This partial gene may replace any portion of the residing VSG gene, creating a new mosaic VSG.|$|E
5000|$|Trypanosoma brucei, the {{organism}} that causes sleeping sickness, replicates extracellularly {{in the bloodstream}} of infected mammals. In later stages, the parasite crosses the blood brain barrier, resulting in a devastating and usually fatal outcome. As a result of replicating in the bloodstream, T. brucei parasites are subjected to numerous host defense mechanisms including soluble components {{of the immune system}} ( [...] i.e. complement), as well as cellular components of the innate and adaptive immune systems. In order to protect itself from host defenses, the parasite decorates itself with a dense, homogeneous coat (~10^7 molecules) of glycoprotein known as the <b>variant</b> <b>surface</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> (VSG). In the early stages of invasion, the dense protein coat is sufficient to protect the parasite from immune detection. However, the host eventually identifies the VSG as a foreign antigen and mounts an attack against the microbe. The T. brucei parasite has evolved an elegant mechanism to display a completely new coat of VSG antigen, rendering it once again invisible to the host’s immune system. The parasite’s genome has over 1,000 genes that code for different variants of the VSG protein. VSG genes {{can be found on the}} subtelomeric portion of large chromosomes, or on intermediate chromosomes. VSG genes also exist in arrays and many exist as pseudogenes. There is a hierarchy by which the VSG genes are activated. Telomeric VSGs are activated first, followed by array VSGs, and finally pseudogene VSGs. [...] Switching of VSG proteins occurs at a rate substantially higher than the background mutation rate of other genes in the parasite (suggesting that it is a regulated process). The process is partially dependent on homologous recombination of DNA, which is mediated in part by the interaction of the T. brucei BRCA2 gene with RAD51 (however, this is not the only responsible mechanism, as BRCA2 variants still display some VSG switching). [...] In addition to homologous recombination, transcriptional regulation also plays an important role in antigen switching. This is in contrast to other pathogens, where antigenic variation is typically mediated by DNA rearrangements or transcriptional regulation. The process by which VSG switching occurs has not been fully elucidated, but it is known that activation of VSGs requires recombination of the VSG genes into a VSG expression site (ES). The ES consists of a single vsg gene flanked by an upstream array of 70 base pair repeats and expression site associated genes (ESAGs). T. brucei expresses one VSG at any given time, and the active VSG can either be selected by activation of a previously silent ES, or by recombination of a VSG sequence into the active ES (see the figure [...] "Mechanisms of VSG Switching in T. brucei"). [...] Although the biological triggers that result in VSG switching are not fully known, mathematical modeling suggests that the ordered appearance of different VSG variants is controlled by at least two key parasite-derived factors: differential activation rates of parasite VSG and density-dependent parasite differentiation.|$|E
