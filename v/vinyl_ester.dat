Utilizing aircraft grade pre-impregnated balsa core material and Kevlar / fibreglass fabric, the hull and deck are laid up using <b>vinyl</b> <b>ester</b> resin for strength, blister resistance and light weight. The C 37 Plus series are built up with isophthalic (Hydrex®) gelcoat, C's exclusive Kevlar hybrid, E-Glass, pre-impregnated end-grain Baltek AL-600 balsa ( [...] balsa core in hull and [...] in deck) and Hydrex® resin.

40|$|Flavonoids are {{naturally}} occurring compounds that are consumed {{regularly in the}} diet. The property of flavonoids, which they are most commonly known for, is their antioxidant activity. Other potential pharmaceutical applications of flavonoids {{can be related to}} their enzyme inhibition, anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anti-cancer properties. Lipases have been used effectively in the production of flavonoid ester derivatives that have shown both increased antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. Enzymatic esterifications of flavonoids are performed in organic solvents that increase substrate solubility of complex organic molecules. For the esterification of compounds in non-aqueous reaction conditions, <b>vinyl</b> <b>esters</b> are often preferred as substrates compared to carboxylic acids (which can be involved in reversible reactions, due to the formation of the by-product, water). In this study a group of <b>vinyl</b> <b>esters</b> of tert-butoxycarbonylated amino acid derivatives were synthesized to study alongside a range of commercially available <b>vinyl</b> <b>esters.</b> The synthesis of ester derivatives of naringin using a range of hydrolytic enzymes has been studied. A range of small to medium sized commercially available <b>vinyl</b> <b>esters</b> (C 2 - C 10), as well as amino acid <b>vinyl</b> <b>esters</b> were selected for the biotransformations. For the esterification of naringin, small-scale reactions were carried out for 72 hrs and the reaction mixtures were analysed by HPLC. Lipases from the species Pseudomonas stutzeri, Candida antarctica and Alcaligenes spp. performed more than 80 % conversion of naringin with some of the selected acylating agents. Reactions carried out with P. stutzeri lipase were scaled up to isolate the product of the biotransformation. None of the screened enzymes were successful in the acylation of naringin with the amino acid <b>vinyl</b> <b>esters.</b> Assays were carried out to compare the antioxidant activity of naringin and the synthesized derivatives. Two of the acyl derivatives showed a greater antioxidant activity in the reduction of Cu 2 +, compared to naringin. Aminoglycosides are antibiotics that have anti-bacterial properties. As well as their anti-bacterial properties some have been employed for their ability to suppress stop codons, which is a useful property in reducing symptoms of some hereditary disorders. In the present work attempts were made to derivatise an aminoglycoside by acylating it with the amino acid <b>vinyl</b> <b>esters,</b> using hydrolytic enzymes.

30|$|The {{differences}} in conversion {{when the two}} acyl donors were used can be due to multiple reasons. <b>Vinyl</b> <b>esters</b> are often used to achieve high conversions in transesterification reactions, which is facilitated {{by the fact that}} the leaving group, vinyl alcohol, is not stable, but is spontaneously converted to acetaldehyde, thereby making the acylation reaction virtually irreversible [15]. Ethyl esters can be used in a similar way if the ethanol formed is evaporated [16], but this approach is less efficient than the use of <b>vinyl</b> <b>esters.</b> Furthermore, the double bound in the acrylate moiety often makes it less reactive in lipase-catalyzed conversions [17, 18].|$|R

However, appropriate derivatisation may alter both the chemical and physical properties and thereby allow further utilisation of polyphenols. Derivatisation of polyphenols was achieved by esterification and etherification of the phenol groups. Esterification was achieved by alcoholysis of acid chlorides and transesterification with <b>vinyl</b> <b>esters,</b> while etherification was achieved by the ring opening of propylene oxide. The polyphenols used were resorcinol, catechin, Pinus radiata bark tannin, and Schinopsis lorentzii tannin. The products were characterised using a range of techniques including NMR (1 H, 13 C and 2 D NMR in both the solution and solid state), ESI-MS, GPC, DSC, TGA, and rheology. The preparation of polyphenolic esters by alcoholysis provided model compounds to establish the key chemical, spectroscopic, and physical features. A range of simple polyphenol esters such as resorcinol dilaurate and catechin pentalaurate were prepared using lauroyl chloride. Furthermore, tannin lauroyl esters were prepared {{with varying degrees of}} substitution. A transesterification method was developed for the preparation of polyphenol esters. Ester interchange occurred effectively in the presence of base catalyst in aqueous solution or dimethyl sulfoxide with short or long chain <b>vinyl</b> <b>esters.</b> This included the first report of the base-catalysed transesterification of flavonoids by <b>vinyl</b> <b>esters</b> to give products such as catechin mono- and di-laurate. Transesterification occurred preferentially at the B-ring as shown by NMR spectroscopy. Subsequently, this transesterification procedure was used to prepare tannin esters. The chemical and physical properties of polyphenol esters were assessed using thermal, antioxidant, and UV/VIS light absorption analysis. Thermal analysis indicated melt/flow properties for some of the polyphenol esters. In some cases, the thermal stability was also shown to increase upon esterification. The antioxidant activity was shown to decrease upon transesterification of pine bark tannin with vinyl laurate, while the UV/VIS absorption was shown to increase. These properties may lend the products towards applications as polymer additives or pharmaceuticals. Polyphenol ethers were prepared by the Williamson ether synthesis and ring opening of propylene oxide. However, the Williamson ether synthesis, a common route to prepare ethers, proved unsuitable for flavonoids. Catechin and tannin hydroxypropyl ether derivatives of varying substitution were prepared by the ring-opening of propylene oxide in the presence of triethylamine. Upon hydroxypropylation the thermal properties of the polyphenol were altered.
