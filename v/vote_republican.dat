5|$|Houston is {{considered}} to be a politically divided city whose balance of power often sways between Republicans and Democrats. Much of the city's wealthier areas <b>vote</b> <b>Republican</b> while the city's working class and minority areas vote Democratic. According to the 2005 Houston Area Survey, 68percent of non-Hispanic whites in Harris County are declared or favor Republicans while 89 percent of non-Hispanic blacks in the area are declared or favor Democrats. About 62percent of Hispanics (of any race) in the area are declared or favor Democrats. The city has often been known to be the most politically diverse city in Texas, a state known for being generally conservative. As a result, the city is often a contested area in statewide elections. In 2009, Houston became the first US city with a population over 1 million citizens to elect a gay mayor, by electing Annise Parker.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{had formed}} a number of factions. The Radical Republicans sought voting and other civil rights for African Americans. They {{believed}} that the freedmen could be induced to <b>vote</b> <b>Republican</b> in gratitude for emancipation, and that black votes could keep the Republicans in power and Southern Democrats, including former rebels, out of influence. They believed that top Confederates should be punished. The Moderate Republicans sought to keep the Democrats out of power at a national level, and prevent former rebels from resuming power. They were not as enthusiastic {{about the idea of}} African-American suffrage as their Radical colleagues, either because of their own local political concerns, or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly. Northern Democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states. They did not support African-American suffrage, which might threaten Democratic control in the South.|$|E
25|$|Although {{his victory}} {{was not a}} {{landslide}} in the popular vote, Bush carried certain states that have not voted for a Republican since, such as Vermont, all of Maine, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Illinois, and California, while Michigan and Pennsylvania would not <b>vote</b> <b>Republican</b> again until 2016, as did Maine's 2nd congressional district. Meanwhile, New Mexico wouldn't <b>vote</b> <b>Republican</b> again until 2004, and Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Tennessee wouldn't <b>vote</b> <b>Republican</b> again until 2000. This election {{was the last time}} that a Republican was elected President without winning West Virginia. Neither his victory percentage (53.4%) nor his total electoral votes (426) have been surpassed in any subsequent presidential election. Barack Obama came closest in the former with 52.9% in 2008, and Bill Clinton closest in the latter with 379 electoral votes in 1996. Bush was the last candidate to receive an absolute majority of the popular vote until his son George W. Bush's 2004 election. This was the last election to date in which a Republican presidential nominee won a majority of Northern electoral votes.|$|E
5000|$|This was {{the last}} {{election}} in which Massachusetts <b>voted</b> <b>Republican</b> until 1980, the last in which Alabama and Mississippi voted Democrat until 1976, the last in which Connecticut, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, and West Virginia <b>voted</b> <b>Republican</b> until 1972, and the last in which Delaware, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, and New Mexico <b>voted</b> <b>Republican</b> until 1968.|$|R

In doing so he broke the second-last still-standing streak of <b>voting</b> <b>Republican</b> from that party’s first election in 1856, leaving Illinois’ Carroll County as the solitary county to have <b>voted</b> <b>Republican</b> at every presidential election since that party’s formation. (Carroll County would eventually have its streak broken by Barack Obama in 2008.) ...|$|R

25|$|Though the {{majority}} (60–70%) of the country's Jews identify as Democratic, Jews span the political spectrum, with those {{at higher levels}} of observance being {{far more likely to}} <b>vote</b> <b>Republican</b> than their less observant and secular counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Now that Italian Americans have assimilated {{and joined}} the ranks of the middle class, their {{politics}} have shifted. It is not unusual for Italian Americans in Boston, as elsewhere, to <b>vote</b> <b>Republican</b> or to run for office as Republicans; for example, Massachusetts governors Paul Cellucci and John Volpe were Republicans.|$|E
25|$|Mormons' {{political}} affiliations tend to vary geographically: {{while in}} Utah and Idaho {{the majority of}} members incline to <b>vote</b> <b>Republican,</b> in traditionally more Democratic U.S. regions such as New England and California, {{there is a tendency}} to have more Democratic members. Outside the United States, Mormons tend to follow national and geographical political trends.|$|E

25|$|In 1962, Swainson was {{defeated}} by Republican George W. Romney, {{the chairman of the}} American Motors Corporation, who had never before held elected office. The win was attributed in part to Romney's appeal to independent voters, {{as well as to the}} increasing influence of suburban Detroit voters, who, by 1962, were more likely to <b>vote</b> <b>Republican</b> than the heavily Democratic city.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, he {{represented}} Pennsylvania's 6th congressional district based in Reading and including Berks and Schuylkill counties.

25|$|Cuban Americans still tend to <b>vote</b> <b>Republican,</b> {{though there}} has been a {{noticeable}} change starting with the 2008 elections.

According to Bendixen's exit polls, 84% of Miami-Dade Cuban American voters 65 or older backed McCain, while 55% of those 29 or younger backed Obama, showing that the younger Cuban-American generation has become more liberal.|$|E

On October 7, 2003, Davis was recalled, with 55.4% of {{the voters}} supporting the recall (see results of the 2003 California recall). With a plurality of 48.6% of the <b>vote,</b> <b>Republican</b> Arnold Schwarzenegger {{was chosen as the}} new governor. Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante received 31.5% of the vote, and Republican state senator Tom McClintock received 13.5% of the vote.|$|E
25|$|A cloture vote {{succeeded in}} the Senate on November 4, 2013, with 61 voting in favor and 30 against, {{allowing}} the Senate {{to schedule a}} <b>vote.</b> <b>Republican</b> Senators Kelly Ayotte (NH), Susan Collins (ME), Orrin Hatch (UT), Dean Heller (NV), Mark Kirk (IL), Rob Portman (OH), and Pat Toomey (PA) voted for cloture, joining 52 of 53 Democratic senators and both independent senators. Senators Claire McCaskill (D-MO) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) supported the legislation, but were unable to attend the cloture vote.|$|E
25|$|A {{shift in}} the {{behavior}} of Oklahoma voters occurred, beginning in the 1960s. Registered Democrats began to more often <b>vote</b> <b>Republican,</b> due to dissatisfaction with the leftist progressive wing of the national party. After the 2004 Presidential Election, Republicans gained control of the House {{for the first time since}} 1921. In 2010, Republicans gained a large majority of 70 seats in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. In 2016, Republicans gained the largest majority in state history winning 75 of 101 seats.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of Harris County voters are white and {{have tended to}} <b>vote</b> <b>Republican</b> at the presidential level since the mid-20th century; Barack Obama was the first Democrat to win the county since Texas native Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Democratic strength {{is found in the}} city of Houston. Suburban areas such as Cypress, Spring, and Katy in the county's western and northern areas, tend to be strongly Republican. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the county by the largest margins for a Democrat since 1964.|$|E
25|$|Since 1996 {{the county}} has {{traditionally}} leaned Republican in national elections. Republican Congressmen have won every contest and averaged 67% of the <b>vote.</b> <b>Republican</b> Presidential candidates have averaged 55% of the vote, and the last Democratic presidential nominee to carry Orange County was Harry S. Truman in 1948. Republican Senatorial candidates typically garnered 56% of the county vote until the electorate swung in favor of Democratic candidates in 2008 and 2012 {{with an average of}} 57% of the vote, then back to Republican candidates in 2014 with 60% of the vote.|$|E
25|$|Like the Irish and Italian, the Jewish {{community}} has {{played an important}} role in recent New York City politics; Jewish voters traditionally vote in large numbers and have often supported politically liberal policies. As the proportion of liberal Conservative and Reform Jews decreases and that of conservative Russian and Orthodox Jews increases in the 21st Century the political interests of New York Jews are changing. The Russian immigrants have shown a tendency to <b>vote</b> <b>Republican</b> while the ultra-orthodox are social conservatives who have a pressing need for supportive social services. There is little support among either group for the liberal community institutions which have been built by the liberal Jewish community. A significant portion of the rapidly growing Hasidic community is pro-Israel and supports the Israeli Settlement Movement.|$|E

25|$|When Texas Governor Beauford H. Jester {{unexpectedly}} died {{in office}} July 11, 1949, then Lieutenant Governor Allan Shivers ascended to the governor's mansion. Shivers controlled {{the wing of}} the Texas Democratic Party that were Dixiecrats, or States' Rights, holdovers. An internal contest for the party played out, with Shivers intent on delivering the state of Texas to Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. Those who aligned themselves with Shivers were called Shivercrats. At the state convention, the Shivercrats controlled the party and influenced the Democrats to <b>vote</b> <b>Republican</b> for Eisenhower, rather than the Democratic party standard bearer Adlai Stevenson. Cunningham and Lillian Collier ran the Texas Women for Stevenson organization out of Austin. In 1953, Cunningham instituted the Texas Democratic Women's State Committee (TDSW), with a constitution that required individual member support for the federal level of the Democratic party. The organization drew the disenfranchised of the state Democrats, the minorities and liberals who were otherwise shut out by the Shivercrats. Ralph Yarborough {{was supported by the}} TDSW when he ran against Shivers in 1952 and 1954.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the major party {{realignment}} that began in the 1970s, central Austin became a stronghold of the Democratic Party, while the suburbs tend to <b>vote</b> <b>Republican.</b> A controversial turning point in the political history of the Austin area was the 2003 Texas redistricting. Before then, Austin had been entirely or almost entirely within the borders of a single congressional district–what was then the 10th District–for over a century. Opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan gerrymandering, and the plan was challenged in court by Democratic and minority activists; of note, the Supreme Court of the United States has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan. The plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003, and on June 28, 2006, the matter was largely settled when the Supreme Court, in a 7–2 decision, upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan {{with the exception of a}} Hispanic-majority district in southwest Texas. This affected Austin's districting, as U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett's district (U.S. Congressional District 25) was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced minority influence in the southwest district; it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern Travis County and several counties to its south and east.|$|E
500|$|Through {{the later}} {{years of the}} 1880s, Warren Harding built the Star. The city of Marion tended to <b>vote</b> <b>Republican</b> (as did Ohio), but Marion County was Democratic. Accordingly, Harding adopted a {{tempered}} editorial stance, declaring the daily Star nonpartisan and circulating a weekly edition that was moderate Republican. This policy attracted advertisers and put the town's Republican weekly out of business. According to his biographer, Andrew Sinclair: ...|$|E
