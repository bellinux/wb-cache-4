5000|$|There {{are other}} factors {{that are related to}} eye {{irritation}} as well. Three major factors that influence the most are indoor air pollution, contact lenses and gender differences. Field studies have found that the prevalence of objective eye signs is often significantly altered among office workers in comparisons with random samples of the general population. [...] These research results might indicate that indoor air pollution has {{played an important role in}} causing eye irritation. There are more and more people wearing contact lens now and dry eyes appear to be the most common complaint among contact lens wearers. [...] Although both contact lens wearers and spectacle wearers experience similar eye irritation symptoms, dryness, redness, and grittiness have been reported far more frequently among contact lens wearers and with greater severity than among spectacle wearers. Studies have shown that incidence of dry eyes increases with age, especially among women. [...] Tear film stability (e.g. break-up time) is significantly lower among women than among men. In addition, women have a higher blink frequency while reading. Several factors may contribute to gender differences. One is the use of eye make-up. Another reason could be that the women in the reported studies have done more <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> than the men, including lower grade work. A third often-quoted explanation is related to the age-dependent decrease of tear secretion, particularly among women after 40 years of age.|$|E

MethodsThirty-one young schoolchildren played computer game (<b>VDU</b> <b>work)</b> and paper game (non-VDU work) continuously for 2 h at 40 cm. Non-invasive tear break up time (NIBUT), blinking rate (BR) and palpebral aperture size (AS) were measured before and after <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> and non-VDU work. Reading for NIBUT, BR and AS were normalized by converting into log 10 unit. ResultsMANCOVA analysis shows that logNIBUT is significantly reduced after both nearwork (F 1, 49 = 58. 10, p 0. 01). Pairwise comparison shows that modes of nearwork produce significant different effect in post-task logBR (F 1, 53 = 7. 13, p= 0. 01) and logAS (F 1, 53 = 11. 00, p< 0. 01). <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> produces lower BR and larger AS while Non-VDU work {{does not change the}} BR but is associated to a smaller AS. ConclusionsSustained 2 -h <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> and non-VDU work produces significant reduction in NIBUT measurements. Modes of nearwork differently change the post-task BR and AS.

40|$|A {{review is}} {{presented}} of epidemiological peer-reviewed publications that relate the mechanical {{exposure of the}} arm in work with visual display units (VDU) to musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb. The twenty included studies were divided into those with (1 - 7) and without (8 - 21) use of physical examination {{in the definition of}} cases. The main conclusion of this review is the documentation of evidence for the <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> per se, none or insufficient lower arm support and non-neutral positions of the wrist as predictors of distal upper limb disorders (DULDs). These findings are based solely on studies that use physical examination or objective signs to define the DULDs, and the conclusions are not changed after inclusion of studies based only on self-reported symptoms. When the last category of studies is included as documentation in the review, the amount of <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> (and an exposuredose/ effect relationship) will also be documented as predictors. The referred studies indicated that not only the <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> per se, but also (and in particular) <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> for more than 20 hours per week combined with limited opportunity for rest breaks and without lower arm support is a predictor of DULDs.

40|$|Upper {{extremity}} musculoskeletal {{complaints and}} disorders are frequently reported among visual display units (VDU) workers. These complaints include cold forearms, hands or fingers. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this}} systematic review was to gain an insight into the relationship between objective and subjective temperature decrease and musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in the upper extremity in a <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> environment by (internal or external) cooling of the arm and hand. Two questions were formulated: (1) Is a <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> environment (temperature between 15 and 25 degrees C) associated with temperature decrease of the arm, hand or fingers in healthy subjects? (2) Is there a difference in arm, hand and finger temperature between patients with upper extremity MSDs and healthy subjects in a <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> environment? METHODS: Through a systematic literature search in six databases between 1989 and October 2005, 327 articles were retrieved and 17 included. RESULTS: Forearm, hand and finger temperature significantly decreases when the ambient temperature (between 15 and 25 degrees C) decreases. The skin temperature in the hand that uses a computer mouse {{is lower than the}} other hand in the same ambient temperature. At baseline, no objective temperature differences are found between patient groups and controls, whereas in patients with cold hand complaints, lower skin temperatures are found compared to controls. The association between temperature (changes) in the forearm, hand or fingers during <b>VDU</b> <b>work,</b> and MSDs in the upper extremity is not clear.

40|$|TNO and BMA Ergonomics are {{developing}} a so-called smart office chair. This chair is supposed to provide feedback on postures and movements during seated office work. The feedback should enable the user (i. e. the worker doing VDU tasks) to perform {{his or her work}} with less discomfort and in a more productive way. One part of this project is a study about the development of musculoskeletal discomfort during <b>VDU</b> <b>work,</b> sitting in various postures. Nineteen subjects did 2 types of <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> in a laboratory setting: call-centre and data-entry. They were instructed to work in a certain sitting posture for 30 minutes, without pauses. After that, they could relax for 30 minutes. Four sitting postures were imposed; the 5 th one was each individual’s freely chosen working posture: the reference posture. Every 3 minutes, local perceived discomfort (LPD) of 5 body regions was determined, by letting subjects rate their LPD on a 10 -point-scale. From that we calculated the relative LPD-dose, setting the dose of the ergonomic optimal posture to 100 %. LPD-doses were not significantly different between the 2 VDU-tasks. Different sitting postures did lead to significantly different LPD-doses; the lowest in the ergonomic optimal posture and the highest one in the ‘vulture’ posture. From the individual development of LPD during 30 minutes of <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> and a prior evaluation of the health risks of prolonged LPD, we can deduce the period of time a subject is allowed to work in a specific posture.

40|$|The regular use {{of visual}} display units (<b>VDUs)</b> at <b>work</b> {{has been shown}} to cause the {{development}} of a constellation of symptoms ranging from dry eyes to temporary myopia. European workers who use VDUs are now protected under detailed legislation enacted by the European Union (Directive 90 / 270 /EEC). The use of picture archiving and communications systems, which are almost ubiquitous in European countries, means that, as a profession, radiologists fall under the remit of this legislation. This paper aims to assess the impact that full implementation of this law would have on a radiologist's practice and to more broadly examine the issue of eye care as an occupational health issue in radiology. The authors conclude that eye care in the setting of regular VDU use among radiologists is an important quality control and occupational health issue. There is a clear legal basis requiring employers to provide regular eye examinations and reporting breaks. In the absence of leadership from employers on this issue individual radiologists have a responsibility to ensure that their work practices reflect the legal situation and minimise the effect of eye strain on their performance...|$|R
40|$|Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} (MSD) {{are common}} in individuals with computer based work. The currently known risk factors for these disorders is in the literature derived to physical, organizational and individual factors. A recent survey of three working groups at a company in Stockholm explored that more than 50 % of the employees had neck and shoulder problems. Aim: The study aims to create a better understanding for the current musculoskeletal problems at the company. Such an understanding is created by examining the physical, organizational and individual risk factors {{in the workplace and}} the result can provide a good basis for intervention proposals. Method: In order to answer the aim of the study the authors chosed to use both qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection through interviews and questionnaire survey. The interview and questionnaire was designed to create both a specific and comprehensive picture of the physical, organizational and individual risk factors having a bearing effect on the existing MSD problem. Result: Seven categories were compiled from interviews, which largely deals with the fact that high demands can lead to behaviors that may pose a significant risk for the occurrence of MSD. Behaviours such as taking fewer breaks and having a hard time letting go of work during breaks and free time. In addition it was found that workers believe that the ventilation is a major cause of the problem. A widespread dissatisfaction with ventilation, temperature and noise were also seen in the responses from the survey. A correlation analysis showed that an exposure of multiple physical risk factors correlate with the prevalence of MSD among workers. Conclusion: The result of this study exemplifies how the interaction between organizational and individual factors may cause MSD in the neck and shoulder. However, it seems that the workers themselves often relate the MSD problem to physical risk factors in the working environment such as poor ventilation. A dissatisfaction with physical factors in the work environment seems to have a moderate correlation with the prevalence of MSD among the workers.

Assessment of physical work load at visual display unit workstations Ergonomic applications and gender aspects Lena Karlqvist Arbete och Hälsa I 997 : 9. Local physical workload at visual display unit(VDU) workstations with different lay-out and computer input devices were studied among men and women. Word processing with keyboard only and a computer mouse were compared. "Mouse" operators worked longer time in stenuous working postures than "non mouse" operators and they corrected a longer text during the given time. The intra and intermethod reliability of a questionnaire for estimation of physical load in word-processing workwas tested. Self-reported duration of <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> and mouse use had a good intramethod reliability, and self-reports on location of key-board and mouse on the work table had a good intermethod reliability when compared with direct measurements. In a cross-sectional study female CAD-operators reported a higher prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms than their male colleagues despite the same education/training, workcontent and self-reported physical load. Location of the mouse outside an "optimal" area on the work table and/or long duration of mouse-use were associated with higher prevalence of upper limb symptoms. An experimental {{study was designed to}} determine posture, muscular load and perceived exertion with six different locations of the computer mouse on the work table. Amouse location on the worktable corresponding to a relaxed, neutral posture of the arm combined with arm support was preferred. Arm support also reduced muscle load in the neck/shoulder region. Comparison of text editing with a mouse and a track-ball showed that work with the track-ball entailed lower shoulder elevation and less shoulder muscle activity, but more wrist extension than work with the mouse. Gender differences in working techniques were observed in the experimental studies and should be subject to further analyses. Development, specification and evaluation of a work table, suitable for <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> with a non-keyboard computer input device, i. e. a mouse was carried out in collaboration with furniture manufactures, employees and employer. It was shown that the lay-out of a <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> table, suitable for workwith different input devices should make it possible to support the arms, to vary between sitting and standing postures and to prevent pronounced abduction and outward rotation of the shoulder.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore {{associations}} between physicalload, psychosocial and individual factors in visual display unit (<b>VDU)</b> <b>work.</b> Furthermore, {{the aim was to}} investigate whether perceived musculartension is a predictor of neck pain among VDU operators. The thesisis based upon five separate studies, two laboratory studies, two fieldstudies and one prospective cohort study. Several different methods were used to assess the physical load. Electromyography(EMG) was used to record muscle activity. Wrist postures andmovements were assessed by means of electrogoniometers. An instrumentedcomputer mouse was used to measure the forces applied to thecomputer mouse. Working technique was assessed with an observationprotocol. Perceived exertion, comfort, mental stress and perceivedmuscular tension were assessed with questionnaires. The results of this work are discussed in relation to a proposed model forVDU work and musculoskeletal symptoms. The first two studies (StudiesI and II) support an association between individual factors (workingtechnique and sex) and the physical load. In Study III we observed thatthe physical load increased as a result of mental stress and increasedproductivity. Besides an increase in muscle activity; increases in the forcesapplied to the computer mouse and increased repetitiveness of wristmovements were also observed. The results from the third study alsosupport an association between psychosocial factors and physical loadthrough increased physical demands. The fourth study (Study IV) supports an association between perceived muscular tension and physicalload and perceived muscular tension is hypothesized to be an early sign ofmusculoskeletal symptoms. In Study V an increased risk of developingneck pain was observed among subjects who perceived high musculartension, even when controlling for job strain, physical exposure and age. It is concluded that the physical load during <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> is affected bypsychosocial and individual factors as well as physical demands.

Frequent users of VDU had significantly more musculoskeletal problems in the neck and shoulder regions than infrequent users. Individual musculoskeletal complaints were associated with various risk factors including personal attributes, working posture, repetitive movements and work station design. Back, neck and shoulder problems were more related to unfavourable working postures, while arm, hand and wrist problems were more affected by repetitive movements.

40|$|Possible {{relations}} between prevalence of {{sick building syndrome}} (SBS) and environmental, occupational, and personal factors were studied in a random sample (0. 1 %) {{of the general population}} aged 20 - 65 in a three county region in middle Sweden. Childhood exposure to environmental tobacco smoke from smoking mothers and a childhood in urban areas was related to SBS symptoms. Current urban residency, fresh paint, and preschool children in the dwelling were also related to symptoms. Other residential factors such as age of building, type of building, degree of crowding, mechanical ventilation, or signs of moisture or mould growth were not related to symptoms. Other factors related to symptoms were history of atopy, allergy to nickel, proneness to infection, hyperreactivity, static electricity, work with video display units (<b>VDU),</b> <b>work</b> satisfaction, and climate of cooperation at work. Age, sex, marital state, education level, work stress, obesity, current or earlier smoking, regular physical exercise, or occupational exposure to chemicals did not correlate with symptoms. Women had a higher proportion of symptoms than men but these differences were not significant when adjusting for differences in allergy to nickel, hyperreactivity, and proneness to infection. Maternal smoking was related to a twofold increase of both atopy and allergy to nickel in the adult offspring. Eye symptoms were most common in administrative, managerial, and service work. Airway symptoms were most common in transport and communication work. Dermal symptoms were most common in professional and technical and related work. General symptoms were most common in service, health, hospital, and social work. The lowest prevalence of symptoms was found in agricultural, forestry, and sales work. Women and subjects allergic to nickel worked more often in occupations without exposure to chemicals, but no evidence was found for selection mechanisms causing sensitive persons to move from exposed to unexposed occupations. It was concluded that symptoms included in SBS are common in the general population, and of multifactorial origin related to both personal, occupational, and residential factors, and certain environmental exposures such as maternal smoking, the urban environment, <b>VDU</b> <b>work,</b> and volatile organic hydrocarbons from newly painted dwellings...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} work related and individual factors as predictors of insident neck pain among video display unit (VDU) workers, to assess the effects of an ergonomic intervention and education on musculoskeletal symptoms, and to study the repeatability and validity of an expert assessment method of VDU workstation ergonomics. A method to assess the risk factors for upper limb disorders was developed, and its validity and repeatability were studied. The annual incidence of neck pain was 34. 4 %. A poor physical work environment and placement of the keyboard were work-related factors increasing the risk of neck pain. Among the individual factors, female sex was a strong predictor. The randomized intervention study included questionnaire survey, a diary of discomfort, and ergonomic rating of the workstations. The subjects (n= 124) were allocated into three groups. The intensive and the education groups had less musculoskeletal discomfort than the control group at the 2 -month follow-up. After the intervention, the level of ergonomics was distinctly higher in the intensive ergonomic group than in the education or control group. Two experts in ergonomics analyzed and rated the ergonomics of workstations before and after intervention. The validity of the assessment method was rated against the technical measurements, assessment of tidiness and space, and work chair ergonomics. The intraclass correlation coefficient between ratings of the two experts was 0. 74. Changes in the location of the input devises and the screen, as well as the values of tidiness and space and work chair ergonomics showed a significant association with the ratings of both experts. The method to assess the loads imposed on the upper limbs was validated against the expert observations from the video, continuous recordings of myoelectric activity of forearm muscles, and wrist posture, measured with goniometers. Inter-observer repeatability and validity were good or moderate. Both intensive ergonomics approach and education in ergonomics have effects in reducing discomfort in <b>VDU</b> <b>work.</b> In attemps to improve the ergonomics of VDU workstation, the best result will be achieved with cooperative palaning in which both workers and pratitioners are actively invoved.

40|$|In {{order to}} avoid the {{disadvantages}} of purely subjective methods in a technical evaluation of daylight and artificial light systems, the Bartenbach LichtLabor developed new test methods which can determine objectively and quantitatively the visual or psycho-physiological stress connected with <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> [1], depending on different lighting conditions. Daylight and artificial lighting systems were tested with these methods and compared by using the performances achieved by the test subjects. Some highly significant differences in performance done under the individual lighting systems became apparent and demonstrated that the visual stress or the physical or physiological fatigue from an ergonomic viewpoint depends largely on the lighting conditions at the workplace. This holds true for daylight systems (glare protection, re-directing lamellae, clear window as a control condition) as well as for purely artificial lighting systems where especially the choice of color temperature of the light and the used control gear (conventional or electronic) determine the resulting performance. Optimized lighting also positively affects the productivity and economicy for the design of workplaces that take the human factor into account...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{assess the}} effect of a {{vertical}} height adjustment of the chair and visual display unit (VDU) on work-related upper quadrant musculoskeletal pain (WRUQMP) and sitting comfort in office workers. The upper quadrant refers to the occiput, cervical and upper thoracic spine, including the clavicles and scapulae. Methods: A single subject (N = 1) study, in which the subject serves as her own control, was conducted using the ABC design. An ergonomic workstation adjustment of VDU and chair height was compared to the subject’s usual workstation settings. Pain and sitting comfort was measured using visual analogue scales (VAS). The subject was assessed over three four-week phases as she performed her typical <b>VDU</b> <b>work.</b> The results were compiled and tabulated. Results: Both the mean and variance in pain intensity decreased after the workstation intervention. A deterioration in sitting comfort was noted. Conclusion: The vertical height adjustment of the chair and visual display unit may have contributed to a decrease in work-related upper quadrant musculoskeletal pain in this subject. This safe, economical workstation intervention may be a practical management option for the computer user suffering from work-related upper quadrant musculoskeletal pain. Further research into the measurement of comfort whilst sitting at a computer workstation is recommended. </p...|$|E

Both subjective and objective physical load measures were recorded during sitting with and without Back-Up, most of them during <b>VDU</b> <b>work.</b> The main result was that the posture of the upper back and neck/head was improved by the Back-Up. However, the knee straps induced unacceptable high pressure and increased significantly the discomfort in the legs. Based on these results the Back-Up was modified: the contact area between the strap and the knee was enlarged. This modified Back-Up was tested again for 13 variables with 10 new subjects. The knee pressure {{turned out to be}} acceptable and the discomfort was equal to sitting without the Back-Up. Based on this research the Back-Up is considered as a possible addition to more fundamental ergonomic improvements such as adjustable furniture and variation between sitting, standing and walking tasks, especially for improvement of the neck load. However, the Back-Up should not replace proper ergonomic workstation and work organization design or a backrest on the chair. Furthermore, the Back-Up should not be made obligatory, and it should be worn only for a part of the day, because it limits variation in postures...|$|E

Description of electromagnetic hypersensitivity The symptoms described by electromagnetic hypersensitive individuals include both symptoms from the skin and a more divergent symptomatology with items such as headache, tiredness, difficulty in concentration, memory problems and dizziness. To a varying degree also other symptoms such as eye discomforts are described. The symptoms are seldom specific, however, since they occur also in other groups of individuals. Due to this and to other reasons, there are currently no established criteria for a diagnosis of electromagnetic hypersensitivity. There are good reasons to separate individuals with skin problems during work with visual display units (VDUs) and electromagnetic hypersensitive individuals, where neurasthenic problems are more prevalent, and where the problems are attributed to several different Òelectrical" situations. The most common result of mild skin symptoms during <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> is that these disappear with time, not that they develop to more serious cases of electromagnetic hypersensitivity. Today, there are no clear distinctions between electromagnetic hypersensitive individuals and others concerning individual related factors, although some indications of such differences have appeared; among other things concerning gender, personality traits and certain dermatological findings. One possibility supported by some findings is that electromagnetic hypersensitive individuals could have an instability in the autonomic nervous system, but a definite verification of this is currently lacking. Skin problems during <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> are commonly occurring. The number of electromagnetic hypersensitive individuals having serious problems with major consequences is, on the other hand, most likely limited. A possible tendency for a decreasing number of new cases can be seen, but it must be emphasised that this evaluation is somewhat uncertain. Individuals with electromagnetic hypersensitivity often attribute the problems to proximity to VDUs or extensive <b>VDU</b> <b>work,</b> and proximity to fluorescent tubes. Electromagnetic hypersensitive individuals with neurasthenic symptoms, however, often have a wider attribution than only to VDU- and fluorescent tube situations. This wide range of attributed situations includes both a large variety of EMF sources and other factors such as sunlight. International comparisons indicate that both symptom and attributions differ between those countries where electromagnetic hypersensitive exists. External risk indicators and causal factors The appearance of skin symptoms is associated with the extent of <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> (and a similar relationship is often described by electromagnetic hypersensitive individuals). This work situation does, however, include a large number of different factors; physical and ergonomic as well as organisational and psycho-social. Some studies point to a role for thermal factors such as low relative humidity and/or high room temperature, and to work related stress factors for the appearance of skin problems during <b>VDU</b> <b>work.</b> Concerning EMF, it can be pointed out that <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> situations do not constitute a high exposure situation in terms of fields of net frequencies compared to situations close to heavy electrical equipments. For fields of higher frequencies or other measures of the field strength than the amplitude, such a general statement can not be given. Experimental and observational studies do currently not give any support for the hypothesis that low frequency fields similar to those encountered at <b>VDU</b> <b>work</b> places would lead to health problems for electromagnetic hypersensitive individuals. Concerning skin problems during <b>VDU</b> <b>work,</b> some findings weakly suggest a role for various electric fields, but no clear conclusion can be made at present. For fields of higher frequencies, research results are currently not sufficient for any conclusions. Studies of other groups than electromagnetic hypersensitive individuals have, however, indicated that some symptoms of neurasthenic nature (such as sleep problems and depressive symptoms) could be associated with the existence of extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields : but the relevant causal mechanism is unclear, both the possibility of a direct physical/physiological link and an association due to worry about the field can be considered. Concerning low frequency fields and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), some indications of associations have appeared in a few studies, but no conclusions can currently be made : these studies are too few and too uncertain. Interesting suggestions exist for a relationship between amplitude modulated light and symptoms among electromagnetic hypersensitive individuals. There are also some studies that indicate relationships between worry and health problems, but the interpretation of these latter relationships is unclear; both the possibility that worry leads to adverse health, and that adverse health creates worry are feasible interpretations of these findings. Taken together, {{there are a number of}} reasons to look at electromagnetic hypersensitivity as a condition with a multifactorial genesis, that in principle could include both physical, stress related and psychosomatic mechanisms. The possibility that different combinations of such mechanisms can cause electro-magnetic hypersensitivity must now be kept open. The results of various reported action programmes and follow-up studies suggest that improvements for a large part of the afflicted can be achieved. In those reports, it is, however, not possible to differentiate between the effects of different types of actions, making it difficult to draw conclusions about specific causal factors from these results. Whether action programmes directed towards reduction of electric and magnetic fields constitute an effective handling has not yet been evaluated in a systematic way : a common description of the effects of such actions is often Òbetter but not well". Also when concerning other treatments, there is a current lack of evaluations showing a specific effect of a certain treatment. In general, however, it should be pointed out that early handling, as is also the case in other medical conditions, is recommendable and probably coincides with a better prognoses. Kriteriegruppen för fysikaliska riskfaktorer tillsatte hösten 1995 en expertgrupp med uppdrag att utreda dels kunskapsläget avseende riskindikatorer och orsaks-faktorer för elöverkänslighet, dels huruvida exponering för elektro-magnetiska fält leder till elöverkänslighet eller liknande hälsoproblem. Vidare ingick i uppdraget att utreda möjligheten att vissa neurologiska sjukdomar kan bero på exponering för elektromagnetiska fält. Elöverkänslighet beskrivs i denna rapport som besvär och ohälsa som drabbar vissa individer i närhet av elektrisk utrustning. Konsekvenserna för individen varierar, men för en del leder tillståndet till allvarliga konsekvenser för arbete och livskvalitet. Dessa individers hälsoproblem utgör huvudmotivet för den aktuella utredningen : sammanställningen av forskningsresultat syftar ytterst till att förbättra möjlig-heten till adekvata och effektiva åtgärder. Beskrivning av elöverkänslighet De symtom som beskrivs av elöverkänsliga innefattar både symtom från huden och en mer divergent symtombild som huvudvärk, trötthet, koncentrations- och minnessvårigheter samt yrsel. I varierande omfattning beskrivs även andra symptom som ögonbesvär. Symtomen är dock sällan specifika, i det att de förekommer även i andra grupper. Av denna och andra anledningar finns idag inga vedertagna kriterier för diagnossättning elöverkänslighet. Det finns goda skäl att skilja på individer med hudbesvär vid bild-skärmsarbete och elöverkänsliga, där problem av neurovegetativ natur oftare förekommer, och besvären även tillskrivs olika "elektriska" situationer. Det vanligaste utfallet av lätta hudbesvär vid bildskärmsarbete tycks vara att dessa försvinner med tiden, inte att de utvecklas till svårare fall av elöverkänslighet. Man har idag inte någon klar bild av eventuella skillnader mellan elöverkäns-liga och andra vad gäller individbundna faktorer, även om vissa indikationer på sådana skillnader finns; bland annat avseende kön, personlighetsdrag och vissa dermatologiska fynd. En möjlighet som stöds av en del fynd är att elöver-käns-liga skulle uppvisa en instabilitet i det autonoma nerv-systemet, men säkra belägg för detta saknas f. n. Hudbesvär vid bildskärmsarbete är vanligt förekommande. Antalet elöver-känsliga individer med allvarliga problem i form av vittgående konsekvenser är å andra sidan sannolikt begränsat. Möjligen finns en tendens att tillströmningen av nya fall av elöverkänslighet minskar, men osäker-heten i denna bedömning måste påpekas. Individer med elöverkänslighet förknippar ofta problemen med närhet till bild-skärm eller omfattande bildskärmsarbete samt närhet till lysrör. Individer med elöverkänslighet där även neurovegetativa symtom förekommer uppvisar ofta en bredare attribuering än enbart närhet till bildskär-mar och lysrör. Denna bredd föreligger dels avseende vilka EMF-källor som avses, men också att även andra situationer än de nära EMF-källor ger upphov till hälsoproblem (t. ex. solljus). Internationella jämförelser indikerar att både symtombild och attribuering skiljer sig åt mellan olika länder där begreppet elöverkänslighet finns. Externa riskindikatorer och orsaksfaktorer Hudsymtom uppvisar ett samband med omfattningen av bildskärmsarbete (och motsvarande samband indikeras ofta av elöverkänsliga). Denna arbetssituation innefattar dock en rad olika faktorer; fysikaliska och ergonomiska liksom organisatoriska och psyko-sociala. Några studier pekar bl. a. på en roll för termiska faktorer som låg relativ luftfuktighet och/eller hög temperatur liksom för arbets-relaterade stressfaktorer när det gäller uppkomst av hudbesvär vid bildskärms-arbete. När det gäller elektromagnetiska fält kan det påpekas att bildskärms-situationer ej utgör någon hög exponering vad gäller nätfrekventa fält jämfört med situationer nära tung elektrisk utrustning. För fält av högre frekvenser eller andra mått på fältens styrka än amplituden kan en sådan generell bedömning inte göras. Experimentella och observationella studier ger för närvarande inte något stöd för hypotesen att lågfrekventa fält liknande de som förekommer vid bildskärms-arbetsplatser leder till besvär hos elöverkänsli-ga. När det gäller hudbesvär vid bildskärmsarbete finns några fynd som antyder en möjlig roll för olika elektriska fält, men någon klar slutsats kan f. n. inte dras. För fält av högre frekvenser är forsknings-resultaten f. n. ej tillräckliga för att några slutsatser ska kunna dras. Studier av andra grupper än elöverkänsliga har dock indikerat att vissa sym-tom av neurasten natur (som sömnsvårigheter och depressiva symtom) kan ha ett sam-band med existensen av extremt lågfrekventa magnetiska fält : men den relevanta orsaks-mekanismen är oklar : både möjligheten av en direkt fysikalisk/fysio-logisk koppling och ett samband baserat på oro för fält kan vara aktuella. Vad gäller lågfrekventa fält och neurologiska sjukdomar som Alzheimers sjukdom och ALS föreligger osäkra indikationer för samband i några studier, men inga konklusioner kan för närvarande göras : dessa studier är i dagsläget för få och för osäkra. Intressanta indikationer på ett samband mellan amplitud-modulerat ljus och symtom hos elöverkänsliga individer föreligger. Det finns även några studier som indikerar samband mellan oro för hälsorisker och hälsoproblem, men tolk-ningen av sådana samband är oklar, både möjligheten av att oro leder till ohälsa, och att ohälsa orsakar oro är möjliga. Sammantaget finns det flera skäl att se elöverkänslighet som ett tillstånd med multifaktoriell genes, som i princip skulle kunna innefatta både fysikaliska, stressrelaterade och psykosomatiska mekanismer. Möjligheten att olika kombinationer av sådana mekanismer är orsak till elöverkänslighet måste f. n. stå öppen. Resultaten av olika rapporterade åtgärdsprogram och uppföljningsstudier tyder på att en förbättring för en stor del av de drabbade kan ske. Man har dock i dessa rapporter inte kunnat särskilja effekter av olika typer av åtgärder, vilket gör det svårt att ur dessa resultat dra slutsatser om specifika orsaksfaktorer. Huruvida åtgärdsprogram som inriktats på elektriska och magnetiska fält utgör ett effektivt hanterande har ännu inte utvärderats systematiskt : en vanlig beskrivning av effekten av sådana åtgärder är ofta Òbättre men inte bra". Även när det gäller andra behandlingsåtgärder saknas idag utvärderingar som har påvisat en specifik effekt av en viss behandling. Allmänt bör dock påpekas att ett tidigt omhändertagande, på samma sätt som vid andra medicinska tillstånd, är önskvärt och sannolikt förenat med en bättre prognos...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Since the introduction of immersive virtual reality (VR) equipment, {{a number of studies}} have found that users can experience unpleasant side effects. A major focus of VR research and development has been on head-mounted display (HMD) based systems. Incorporation of an HMD provides the user with a sensation of immersion and presence in the virtual environment (VE), and it has been these systems that have attracted the most attention from both the media and human factors researchers over the last ten to fifteen years. Health and safety concerns associated with the use of this technology include symptoms experienced by users which resemble those of motion sickness (for example, disorientation, pallor, stomach awareness and nausea) and reports of visual discomfort, particularly eyestrain. The motion sickness-like symptoms have been referred to as virtual simulation sickness (VSS), and VSS is considered to be a form of visually-induced motion sickness. Susceptibility to motion sickness varies immensely, however females are generally regarded as being more susceptible than males to all forms of motion sickness, and it has been suggested that this heightened susceptibility in females could be attributed to the functioning of the female endocrine system. Changes to many of the body's systems have been reported to occur over the menstrual cycle, and it is reasonable to suggest that changes in susceptibility to nauseogenic visual stimuli may also occur. The first piece of research conducted in this thesis examined the influence of the menstrual cycle on susceptibility to VSS. 16 naturally cycling females were immersed in a nauseogenic YE on specific days (5, 12, 19 and 26) of their menstrual cycle, these days were chosen because they fall in line with peaks and troughs of ovarian hormone levels. The menstrual cycle phase of participants was confirmed by the measurement of salivary oestradiol and progesterone levels. The responses from the naturally cycling females (the experimental group) were compared to those from two control groups, consisting of 16 pre-menopausal females taking a combined monophasic oral contraceptive, and 16 men. Susceptibility to VSS did vary over the menstrual cycle, with susceptibility increasing on day 12, this was seen as both an increase in symptom severity and a decrease in symptom onset time. No consistent variation was seen in the females taking a combined monophasic oral contraceptive. In addition to susceptibility to VSS changing over the menstrual cycle, variations in reports of visual discomfort were also apparent, with visual discomfort also increasing on day 12. As no previous research has investigated the influence of the menstrual cycle on susceptibility to visual discomfort, two studies were conducted to determine whether such a relationship exists in other situations. The first was a laboratory based experiment whereby visual discomfort was induced by prolonged accommodative effort, and the second was a field study whereby reports of visual discomfort were examined in individuals performing intensive <b>VDU</b> <b>work.</b> Unlike the changes in visual discomfort seen over the menstrual cycle in females viewing a nauseogenic VE through an HMD, no changes in visual discomfort were found over the menstruaJ cycle when visual discomfort was induced by prolonged accommodative effort, or by intensive <b>VDU</b> <b>work.</b> It was concluded from this research that the previously seen changes in susceptibility to visual discomfort over the cycle, in females viewing a nauseogenic VE, were not a consequence of susceptibility to visual discomfort changing over the cycle. In the first experiment, susceptibility to VSS was seen to increase on day 12, as manifest by an increase in the severity of nausea reported on this day, and increases in general bodily discomfort. It is suggested that the change in visual discomfort reported over the cycle is a consequence of these general changes rather than having a specific ocular origin. This idea was supported in a fourth experiment which examined symptom reports collected from 88 participants immersed in a nauseogenic virtual environment at weekly intervals. A relationship was found between the severity of symptoms of VSS reported and the amount of visual discomfort reported...|$|E
