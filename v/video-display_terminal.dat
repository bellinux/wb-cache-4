500|$|High tech {{companies}} have {{located in the}} area since the 1930s, when International Radio Corporation introduced the first mass-produced AC/DC radio (the Kadette, in 1931) {{as well as the}} first pocket radio (the Kadette Jr., in 1933). The Argus camera company, originally a subsidiary of International Radio, manufactured cameras in Ann Arbor from 1936 to the 1960s. Current firms include Arbor Networks (provider of Internet traffic engineering and security systems), Arbortext (provider of XML-based publishing software), JSTOR (the digital scholarly journal archive), MediaSpan (provider of software and online services for the media industries), Truven Health Analytics, and ProQuest, which includes UMI. Ann Arbor Terminals manufactured a <b>video-display</b> <b>terminal</b> called the Ann Arbor Ambassador during the 1980s. Barracuda Networks, which provides networking, security, and storage products based on network appliances and cloud services, opened an engineering office in Ann Arbor in 2008 on Depot St. and recently announced it will move downtown to occupy the building previously used as the Borders headquarters. [...] Duo Security, a cloud-based access security provider protecting thousands of organizations worldwide through two-factor authentication, is headquartered in Ann Arbor.|$|E
50|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} <b>video-display</b> <b>terminals</b> (VDTs) {{in the mid-1970s}} ushered {{in the second phase}} of command-line systems. These cut latency further, because characters could be thrown on the phosphor dots of a screen more quickly than a printer head or carriage can move. They helped quell conservative resistance to interactive programming by cutting ink and paper consumables out of the cost picture, and were to the first TV generation of the late 1950s and 60s even more iconic and comfortable than teleprinters had been to the computer pioneers of the 1940s.|$|R
40|$|As PART of a {{long-range}} goal {{to develop a}} language-instruction program for Arabic, a project to achieve a computerized VERPS, Verb Exercise and Reference Program with Speech, has been developed. The goal {{of the project was}} to develop a system for utilizing high-quality computersynthesized speech for teaching Arabic verbs, and to use this speech system as part of a drill and reference program for these verbs. Work was done on the three aspects ofthe project: verb selection and recording ofbasic forms, construction of the drill and practice program, and development of computerized audio synthesis of verb forms given prefix, stem, and suffix information. VERPS can be used to generate the sounds and printed tokens (using a standard transcription, adapted for a computer terminal; see Appendix A) for a large numberofcommon verbs in Modern StandardArabic (MSA) from a relatively small data base. It {{can also be used to}} present interactive drill exercises for students, with exercises presented on <b>video-display</b> <b>terminals,</b> accompanied by high-quality computer-synthesized speech. In addition, VERPS is usable as a reference source for information on Arabic verbs, including pronunciation, for both students and researchers. Potential uses of the VERPS system are many; we list here the most obvious: 1. VERPS can be used by students to drill Arabic verb forms. 2. Using VERPS, an instructor easily will be able to assign virtually limitless kinds of Arabic verb drills for his students...|$|R
