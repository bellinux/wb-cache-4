5000|$|... #Caption: A {{close-up}} of a caliper's measurement scales. Assuming the caliper has no [...] "zero error" [...] (that is, it registers 0.00 mm when fully closed) the image shows {{a reading of}} 3.58 mm ± 0.02 mm. This is found by adding 3.00 mm (left red mark) read off from the fixed main (upper) scale to 0.58 mm (right red mark) obtained from the sliding vernier (lower) scale. The main scale reading {{is determined by the}} rightmost tick on the main scale that is {{to the left of the}} zero tick on the vernier scale. The <b>vernier</b> <b>reading</b> is found by locating the closest aligned lines between the two scales. The 0.02 mm inscription indicates the caliper's precision and is just the width that corresponds to the smallest interval on the vernier scale.|$|E
50|$|Travelling {{microscope}} {{consists of}} a cast iron base with machined-Vee-top surface and is fitted with three levelling screws. A matallic carriage, clamped to a spring-loaded bar slides with its attached vernier and reading lens along an inlaid strip of metal scale. The scale is divided in half millimeters. Fine adjustments are made {{by means of a}} micrometer screw for taking accurate reading. Both <b>vernier</b> <b>reading</b> to 0.01mm or 0.02mm. Microscope tube consists of 10x Eyepice and 15mm or 50mm or 75mm objectives. The Microscope, with its rack and pinion attachment is mounted on a vertical slide, which too, runs with an attached vernier along the vertical scale. The microscope is free to rotate n vertical plane. The vertical guide bar is coupled to the horizontal carriage of the microscope. for holding objects a horizontal stage made of a milki conolite sheet is provided in the base.|$|E
50|$|The modern <b>vernier</b> caliper, <b>reading</b> to {{thousandths}} of an inch, {{was invented}} by American Joseph R. Brown in 1851. It was the first practical tool for exact measurements that could be sold at a price within the reach of ordinary machinists.|$|R

50|$|There is a {{graduated}} ring on {{the lower}} plate which covered by the upper plate, except two openings at opposite points. Here there are verniers to read angles. On the upper plate is placed a needle box, having divisions for the north end the needle only of about 36 degrees, with a <b>vernier</b> to <b>read</b> the needle's variation. Upon this plate, is placed the solar apparatus. It consists of a latitude arc, declination arc, and an hour arc. There are also two levels, placed right angles with each other, together with other necessary fixtures.|$|R
50|$|Vernier {{calipers}} are rugged {{and have}} long lasting accuracy, are coolant proof, are {{not affected by}} magnetic fields, and are largely shock proof. They may have both centimeter and inch scales. However, vernier calipers require good eyesight or a magnifying glass to read and {{can be difficult to}} read from a distance or from awkward angles. It is relatively easy to misread the last digit. In production environments, <b>reading</b> <b>vernier</b> calipers all day long is error-prone and is annoying to the workers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduced}} the measure methods model {{and principles of}} Permeability in the ECK-; the uncertainty source for the measure results was analyzed in detail. Combined with the test and calibration works; the mathematical model was established; considering each uncertainty component which affected the measure results of rock permeability. The standard samples of cores; A 38 (length: 2. 495 cm;diameter: 2. 456 cm);was taken for example. The uncertainty of measure results {{was carried out by}} type A and B estimation; the relative uncertainty of the method was calculated. Through reasonable evaluated the components of uncertainty which including causing uncertainty by pressure changing; temperature changing; stability of the measure instruments and <b>vernier</b> caliper <b>reading</b> error. The uncertainty from stability of the measure instruments was detailedly analyzed by the line graph. By evaluating uncertainty of rock permeability in measure results; we find that the biggest influence on total standard uncertainty is the core size; so in the work the operator’s experimental skills should be paid great attention to...|$|R
