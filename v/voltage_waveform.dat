25|$|Conventionally, {{capacitors}} {{are treated}} as if they generate reactive power and inductors as if they consume it. If a capacitor and an inductor are placed in parallel, then the currents flowing through the capacitor and the inductor tend to cancel rather than add. This is the fundamental mechanism for controlling the power factor in electric power transmission; capacitors (or inductors) are inserted in a circuit to partially compensate for reactive power 'consumed' by the load. Purely capacitive circuits supply reactive power with the current waveform leading the <b>voltage</b> <b>waveform</b> by 90degrees, while purely inductive circuits absorb reactive power with the current waveform lagging the <b>voltage</b> <b>waveform</b> by 90degrees. The result {{of this is that}} capacitive and inductive circuit elements tend to cancel each other out.|$|E

[...] This arrangement {{is referred to as the}} Cascaded Two Level (CTL) converter. Functionally it is exactly equivalent to the conventional half-bridge MMC in every respect except for the harmonic performance, which is slightly inferior – although still claimed to be good enough to avoid the need for filtering in most instances.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the loss analysis of single-phase PFC converter with switching ripple current. To estimate the power circuit losses, we need input current and output <b>voltage</b> <b>waveforms.</b> It {{is difficult to}} find the input current and output <b>voltage</b> <b>waveforms</b> exactly, because the switching frequency of a few tens kHz are adopted and the circuit equation at every switching interval must be solved. In this paper, we propose a novel loss analysis method for single-phase PFC converter with switching ripple current. The input current waveform is divided into two parts of the average per switching cycle and the switching ripple, and each of them is approximately calculated from the equivalent circuit. The <b>voltage</b> <b>waveforms</b> are similarly calculated. Thus the approximate expression of each component loss is obtained by averaging the product of voltage and current. This calculated power loss is nearly equal to the measured value. As a result, this proposed method enables us to estimate the power loss without any experiments...|$|R

Interconnect models consume linear <b>voltage</b> <b>waveforms</b> produced by these cell models and produce <b>voltage</b> <b>waveforms</b> for consumption by downstream cell models. Further, the arbitrary waveforms produced by these interconnect models are linearized for consumption by cell models.

2500|$|Solid-state or {{semiconductor}} dimmers {{were introduced}} to solve some of these problems. [...] Semiconductor dimmers switch on at an adjustable time (phase angle) {{after the start of}} each alternating current half-cycle, thereby altering the <b>voltage</b> <b>waveform</b> applied to lamps and so changing its RMS effective value. Because they switch instead of absorbing part of the voltage supplied, there is very little wasted power. Dimming can be almost instantaneous and is easily controlled by remote electronics. [...] This development also made it possible to make dimmers small enough to be used in place (within the pattress) of normal domestic light switches.|$|E
2500|$|Distortion of the {{electric}} current by loads is measured in several ways. [...] Power factor is the ratio of resistive (or real) power to volt-amperes. [...] A capacitive load has a leading power factor, and an inductive load has a lagging power factor. A purely resistive load (such as a filament lamp, heater or kettle) exhibits a power factor of 1. Current harmonics are a measure of distortion of the wave form. [...] For example, electronic loads such as computer power supplies draw their current at the voltage peak to fill their internal storage elements. [...] This {{can lead to a}} significant voltage drop near the supply voltage peak which shows as a flattening of the <b>voltage</b> <b>waveform.</b> This flattening causes odd harmonics which are not permissible if they exceed specific limits, as they are not only wasteful, but may interfere with the operation of other equipment. Harmonic emissions are mandated by law in EU and other countries to fall within specified limits.|$|E
2500|$|Like the {{two-level}} converter and the six-pulse line-commutated converter, a MMC {{consists of}} six valves, each connecting one AC terminal to one DC terminal. [...] However, where each valve of the two-level converter is effectively a high-voltage controlled switch {{consisting of a}} large number of IGBTs connected in series, each valve of a MMC is a separate controllable voltage source in its own right. [...] Each MMC valve consists of a number of independent converter submodules, each containing its own storage capacitor. [...] In the most common form of the circuit, the half-bridge variant, each submodule contains two IGBTs connected in series across the capacitor, with the midpoint connection and one of the two capacitor terminals brought out as external connections. Depending on which of the two IGBTs in each submodule is turned on, the capacitor is either bypassed or connected into the circuit. [...] Each submodule therefore acts as an independent two-level converter generating a voltage of either 0 or Usm (where Usm is the submodule capacitor voltage). [...] With a suitable number of submodules connected in series, the valve can synthesize a stepped <b>voltage</b> <b>waveform</b> that approximates very closely to a sine-wave and contains very low levels of harmonic distortion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract–Dual {{two-level}} inverter topology is {{a simple}} structure able to produce multilevel output voltage wave-forms equivalent to a 3 -level inverter. Its modular structure consists of two standard two-level three-phase voltage source inverters (VSI) supplied by two dc supplies.
