50|$|Bipolar {{electrochemistry}} is {{a phenomenon}} in electrochemistry based on the polarization of conducting objects in electric fields. Indeed, this polarization generates a potential {{difference between the two}} extremities of the substrate that is equal to the electric field value multiplied {{by the size of the}} object. If this potential difference is important enough, then redox reactions can be generated at the extremities of the object, oxidations will occur at one extremity coupled simultaneously to reductions at the other extremity. In a simple experimental setup consisting of a platinum wire in a weighing boat containing a pH indicator solution, a 30 V <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> <b>two</b> electrodes will cause water reduction at one end of the wire (the cathode) and a pH increase (OH− formation) and water oxidation at the anodic end and a pH decrease. The poles of the bipolar electrode also align themselves with the applied electric field.|$|E
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the PRC 349 and UK RT 350 which are 12 Volt (nominal), The Manpack and Portable sets and their chargers were almost all nominally rated 24V DC (Direct Current) to match the British Army's choice of 24 Volts to power its vehicle systems. The Direct Current Charging Units (DCCU) was used to float charge (provide a top up charge while the set was in use) the manpack battery, while it was mounted in a vehicle, using a clip in kit for example. It could also provide a full charge cycle over 4.5 Hours from flat, switching itself out of circuit when complete. (A clip-in kit locked the radio in a convenient frame for rapid deployment when dismounting, and had the charger as part of the installation.) There were a few exceptions where 24 Volts was not used in vehicles, such as in the General Service (GS) Landrover where a 12v system was used for example. A 12 Volt DCCU was provided. The Clansman 24V 4Ah Nickel Cadmium Battery was prolific and for convenience an Alternating Current Charging Unit (ACCU) was provided for use in barracks where up to sixteen batteries could be charged simultaneously or singularly. All of these chargers worked the same, basically providing an appropriate charging current while sensing the battery temperature to detect when charging was complete, achieved by measuring the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> <b>two</b> sets of a series pair of silicon diodes in the battery itself, one series pair would sense the internal temperature of the cells the other series pair fitted close to the outer case of the battery to sense ambient temperature, the difference in temperature being used to determine the state of charge. One drawback of the Clansman 24V 4Ah NICAD is that failure of these diodes makes batteries unserviceable. Also due to partial charge cycles due to the 'memory effect' of the Nicad cells. A discharge process could have prevented such failures, but was not provided for in either the DC or ACCU. Specialists can rebuild the unserviceable Clansman NICAD battery.|$|E

The Seebeck Coefficient {{is a measure of}} an induced <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> <b>two</b> ends of a given material under a small temperature gradient. This temperature difference causes electric charge carriers in the material to move from the warmer end of the material to the colder end, causing a potential difference. A simple relationship is used to determine the Seebeck Coefficient, S=V/T, where V is the potential difference between two ends subject to a temperature difference; T. The ratio of our measured voltage to the temperature difference was positive indicating that the charge carriers in Bismuth are electrons. Our data shows an average experimental value of 62. 2 (ÂµV) /K which implies that the Seebeck Coefficient of Bismuth is - 62. 2 (ÂµV) /K which compares well with the accepted value of - 70 (ÂµV) /K...|$|E
40|$|We study {{effects of}} electron-electron {{interactions}} on the steady-state {{characteristics of a}} hexagonal molecular ring in a magnetic field, {{as a model for}} a benzene molecular junction. The system is driven out of equilibrium by applying a bias <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> <b>two</b> metallic leads. We employ a model Hamiltonian approach to evaluate the effects of on-site as well as nearest-neighbour density-density type interactions in a physically relevant parameter regime. Results for the steady-state current, charge density and magnetization in three different junction setups (para, meta and ortho) are presented. Our findings indicate that interactions beyond the mean-field level renormalize voltage thresholds as well as current plateaus. Electron-electron interactions lead to substantial charge redistribution as compared to the mean-field results. We identify a strong response of the circular current on the electronic structure of the metallic leads. Our results are obtained by steady-state Cluster Perturbation Theory, a systematically improvable approximation to study interacting molecular junctions out of equilibrium, even in magnetic fields. Within this framework general expressions for the current, charge density and magnetization in the steady-state are derived. The method is flexible and fast and can straight-forwardly be applied to effective models as obtained from ab-initio calculations. Comment: 13 pages, 8 figure...|$|E

40|$|<b>Voltages</b> <b>across</b> {{diametrically}} opposite contact pairs on {{the outer}} surface of superconducting Nb tubes are found to depend dramatically upon the spatial configuration of the voltage-measuring leads relative to {{the positions of the}} moving magnetic flux lines. Experiments have been conducted to study these voltages for different wall thicknesses and for a variety of arrangements of the leads when flux in the hole and the wall of the Nb tube is made to exit or enter, completely or partially, by applying heat at a narrow strip along its length. Using the critical-state concept, a model for the change of flux and the resulting electric fields in the Nb tube on application of a heat pulse is presented. The resulting time-dependent and time-integrated voltages are calculated in excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental results. These results show that the flux-flow <b>voltages</b> <b>across</b> <b>two</b> contact points on a superconductor arise from the generation of an induced electric field over a chosen path in the superconductor between the contact points and from a change of magnetic flux through the surface bounded by the measuring leads and the chosen path in the superconductor...|$|R

This method {{does not require}} mechanical load, auxiliary machines or identical motor of similar rating. It simulates the running conditions with normally available apparatus avoiding laborious computations. The induction motor is run on no load at rated <b>voltages</b> <b>across</b> <b>two</b> phases with third phase open. The third phase is connected to a variable inductance. The rated load currents in all the phases are obtained by adjusting the third phase external inductance and making a little difference in two voltages. The different components of losses in new method are nearly same as the losses during normal full load operation. Hence the rise above ambient temperature can be determined accurately. The experimental results on heat run tests with new method and with conventional method show an excellent agreement with each other, confirming {{the validity of the}} proposed method.
