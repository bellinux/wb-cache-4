50|$|<b>Reference</b> Datum:The <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> is a <b>reference</b> {{plane that}} allows accurate, and uniform, {{measurements}} to any {{point on the}} aircraft. The location of the <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> is established by the manufacturer and is defined in the aircraft flight manual. The horizontal <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> is an imaginary vertical plane or point, placed along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, from which all horizontal distances are measured for weight and balance purposes. There is no fixed rule for its location, {{and it may be}} located forward of the nose of the aircraft. For helicopters, it may be located at the rotor mast, the nose of the helicopter, or even at a point in space ahead of the helicopter. While the horizontal <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> can be anywhere the manufacturer chooses, most small training helicopters have the horizontal <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> 100 inches forward of the main rotor shaft centerline. This is to keep all the computed values positive. The lateral <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> is usually located {{at the center of the}} helicopter.|$|R
50|$|A <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> is a {{known and}} {{constant}} surface {{which is used}} to describe the location of unknown points on the Earth. Since <b>reference</b> <b>datums</b> can have different radii and different center points, a specific point on the Earth can have substantially different coordinates depending on the datum used to make the measurement. There are hundreds of locally developed <b>reference</b> <b>datums</b> around the world, usually referenced to some convenient local <b>reference</b> point. Contemporary <b>datums,</b> based on increasingly accurate measurements of the shape of the Earth, are intended to cover larger areas. The most common <b>reference</b> <b>Datums</b> in use in North America are NAD27, NAD83, and WGS 84.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThree {{methods to}} {{establish}} the vertical datum of the crustal motion are put forward and investigated.

The <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> of vertical motion of the crust that are established based on three different principles are analyzed and compared, viz. taking SLR vertical velocity fields as <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> of vertical motion of the crust; taking vertical velocity predicted by postglacial rebound ICE- 4 G geophysical model as reference datum; taking the vertical velocity constrained as zero which located nearby the low latitude belts of equator (− 10 °∼ 10 °) as <b>reference</b> <b>datum.</b> The result shows that there is a better consistency of those three methods in whole, and the <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> of vertical motion of the crust based on SLR vertical velocity has advantages like clear geophysical sense, easy implementation and application...|$|R

40|$|The {{reliability}} of <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> {{is very important}} to characterize engineering surfaces.

In order to verify the feasibility of the new method, computer simulation based on the synthetic sinusoidal waveforms is used and a case study is conducted. The results show that the robust ADRF filtering not only possesses the efficiency of Gaussian filtering under normal conditions, but also enhances the robustness of Gaussian filtering under the conditions of abnormal interferenc...|$|R
40|$|Tidal datum is a {{standard}} height defined by a certain phase of the tide. Tida datum is also the beginning for establishing privately owned land, state owned land, Territorial Sea, Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and high seas boundaries. A review of previous studies shows that technical aspect {{is one of the}} major problems in marine cadastre development because there is no <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> to implement marine administration for marine cadastre. Thus, technical aspect is needed to support marine cadastre development. Foundational to this, marine parcel is a part of space in marine administration which included air space, water column, seabed profile and subsea. It is also consisting vertical and horizontal and water tidal datum elements in marine area. The objectives of this study are to determine the tidal datum, Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) for Peninsular Malaysia and to analyse the stability of LAT as a datum for marine cadastre commencement. Tide datasets were processed using Total Tide Solution (TOTIS) software for computing the LAT as the <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> for marine cadastre. Tidal epoch is from year 1992 to year 2013. Based on the analysis, the range of stability value for LAT with respect to Mean Sea Level (MSL) is - 0. 002 metre to - 0. 500 metre. Therefore, LAT is potential to be used as a <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> for marine parcel commencement in Malaysia due to its stability and consistency as a lowest water level...|$|R

Design constraints for alignment of the sensor element into the camera housing typically include x,y,z, clocking, and parallelism specifications.

General algorithms for determining sensor chip alignment when datum features are inaccessible to the measurement system are described.

The algorithms are successfully implemented for ultraprecision, active manufacturing alignment, and postalignment measurement of IR imaging systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Levelling in {{surveying}} is {{the term}} stand for height difference determination between ground points. If a datum surface is defined for the observed points, the heights of these points (reduced levels) can be computed. In ordinary orthometric levelling Geoid surface is usually used as a datum. Levelling process {{can be carried out}} using different survey equipments and techniques. It may be precise; when precise optical or digital levels are used, or it may be ordinary; when using ordinary optical, automatic or digital levels. Moreover it can be carried out trigonometrically or barometrically. Now a day Global Positioning System (GPS) provides a quick modern technology to determine heights of points. But here, the datum surface is already defined with ellipsoidal surface. Therefore, different reduced levels can be expected compared with orthometric leveling. In this research work, difference in heights between numbers of points, in Khartoum State (Sudan), were carried out using both ordinary orthometric levelling (in which geoid is the <b>reference</b> <b>datum)</b> and GPS techniques (in which ellipsoid is the <b>reference</b> <b>datum).</b> Results obtained showed that the accuracy in levelling for GPS data in levelling for height differences is better than the accuracy of orthometric height determination. Therefore, GPS can be used in many engineering applications when variation in height is the main target. This result leads to ability of GPS to produce grid vector map at scale 1 : 5, 000 and smaller. Moreover, GPS data can be reduced to a new arbitrary datum so that contour maps at scale 1 : 5, 000 and smaller can be plotted...|$|R
