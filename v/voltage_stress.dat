50|$|Partial {{discharges}} {{within an}} insulating material are usually initiated within gas-filled voids within the dielectric. Because the dielectric constant of the void is {{considerably less than}} the surrounding dielectric, the electric field across the void is significantly higher than that across an equivalent distance of dielectric. If the <b>voltage</b> <b>stress</b> across the void is increased above the corona inception voltage (CIV) for the gas within the void, PD activity will start within the void.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Usually basic dc-dc boost {{converters}} {{are unable}} to provide high step up voltage gain due {{to the effect of}} power switches, rectifier diodes and equivalent series resistance of inductors and capacitors and the <b>voltage</b> <b>stresses</b> on the power switches are high. This paper proposes a simple transformerless dc-dc converters to achieve high step up voltage gain without an extremely high duty ratio. The structure of the proposed converters is very simple. This paper proposes three transformerless Dc-Dc converters with switched inductor technique, the duty ratio and the <b>voltage</b> <b>stresses</b> in the active switches of the proposed converters is compared with basic boost converter. The experimental results confirm that the <b>voltage</b> <b>stresses</b> in the active switches is reduced without an extremely high duty ratio in the proposed converters.

50|$|When a gas is {{subjected}} to high <b>voltage</b> <b>stress,</b> the electric field is often quite non-uniform near one, or both, of the high voltage electrodes making up a spark gap. Breakdown initially begins {{with the formation of}} corona discharges near the electrode with the highest electrical stress. If the electrical field is further increased, longer length cold discharges (called streamers or burst corona) sporadically form near the stressed electrode. Streamers are electron avalanches, each one typically lasting only a few nanoseconds. Streamers redistribute charge within the surrounding gas, temporarily forming regions of excess charge (space charges) in the regions surrounding the discharges.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} used test for the investigation of TDDB behavior is [...] "constant stress". Constant stress tests can be applied in form of constant <b>voltage</b> <b>stress</b> (CVS) or constant current stress. In the former, a voltage (that is often lower than the breakdown voltage of the oxide) {{is applied to the}} gate, while its leakage current is being monitored. The time it will take for the oxide to break under this constant applied voltage is called the time-to-failure. The test is then repeated several times to obtain a distribution of time-to-failure. These distributions are used to create reliability plots and to predict the TDDB behavior of oxide at other voltages.|$|E
50|$|During breakdown, {{branching}} tree or fern-like conductive channels rapidly {{form and}} propagate through the plastic, allowing the trapped charge to suddenly rush {{out in a}} miniature lightning-like flash and bang. Breakdown of a charged specimen may also be manually triggered by poking the plastic with a pointed conductive object to create a point of excessive <b>voltage</b> <b>stress.</b> During the discharge, the powerful electric sparks leave thousands of branching chains of fractures behind - creating a permanent Lichtenberg figure inside the specimen. Although the internal charge within the specimen is negative, the discharge is initiated from the positively charged exterior surfaces of the specimen, so that the resulting discharge creates a positive Lichtenberg figure. These objects are sometimes called electron trees, beam trees, or lightning trees.|$|E

5000|$|Writing logic [...] "1" [...] and [...] "0" [...] {{is done by}} {{charging}} and discharging the floating gate in an FJG cell. It is done through current flowing through the pn diode under different <b>voltage</b> <b>stress</b> conditions at different contact nodes. When charging the floating gate, the pn diode is reverse biased, causing large band bending at the floating gate/channel junction. Band-to-Band tunneling will occur under such condition causing electrons tunnel from the floating gate to the channel(Fig.3(a)). Discharging the floating gate is realized by forward biasing the pn diode and draining the charges out of the floating gate(Fig.3(b)). Both processes can be done within a few nano seconds, which enables ultra high speed operation.Fig. 4 illustrates the transient characterization of the read and write operations of an FJG device, wherein the write logic [...] "1" [...] and [...] "0" [...] operations take 5 ns including 1ns rising/falling edge of the signal pulse. It {{can be seen that}} the read logic [...] "1" [...] current is as high as 20μA after the write logic [...] "1" [...] operation while the read logic [...] "0" [...] current is less than 1μA after the write [...] "0" [...] operation.

5000|$|Piezoelectric {{transducers}} {{are used}} to provide ultrasonic energy in the ball bonding process. These transducers are known as bolt-clamped transducers or Langevin transducers. The consist of metal components and piezoelectric elements, all held together by a bolt. These transducers operate at their resonant frequency of lateral vibration to introduce lateral ultrasonic excitation to the capillary. Along the lateral direction of the transducer, there exists nodal points (large displacement) and antinodal points (no displacement). Piezoelectric elements expand and contract upon alternating voltage excitation (which {{will be at the}} resonance frequency), thereby exciting resonance vibration in the structure. Usually, a few elements are stacked in order to increase the electric field for an applied <b>voltage</b> (<b>stress</b> is generated proportional to electric field). In order to maximize the energy transfer from the piezoelectric element to the structure, they are placed at antinodes, which are high strain and high stress regions. At the same time, in order to minimize energy loss to the surroundings, the transducer is held at an antinode (no displacement). At {{the front end of the}} transducer a tapered horn is used to magnify the vibration. Different tapering profiles can be used to get the desired result, such as a linear taper or parabolic taper. The horn's taper reduces the cross-sectional area, causing a larger ultrasonic energy density, then leading to more displacement near the tip. The capillary is placed near the tip for this reason. Higher order bending modes are excited in the capillary, which are quite unideal. In order to mitigate this effect, the capillary clamping position is adjusted to an antinode of the capillary. Ideally, the capillary would be short, but this is not possible because the bond needs to be made in hard to reach areas.|$|E
