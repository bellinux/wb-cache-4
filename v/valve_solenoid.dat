50|$|In {{the final}} version of the GWR system, the {{locomotives}} were fitted with a solenoid-operated valve into the vacuum train pipe, maintained in the closed position by a battery. At each distant signal, a long ramp was placed between the rails. This ramp consisted of a straight metal blade set edge-on, almost parallel to the direction of travel (the blade was slightly offset from parallel so in its fixed position it would not wear a groove into the locomotives' contact shoes), mounted on a wooden support. As the locomotive passed over the ramp, a sprung contact shoe beneath the locomotive was lifted and the battery current holding closed the brake valve was broken. In the case of a clear signal, current from a battery energising the ramp (but at opposite polarity) passed to the locomotive through the contact and maintained the brake valve in the closed position, with the reversed-polarity current ringing a bell in the cab. When the signal was at 'danger', the ramp battery was disconnected and so could not replace the locomotive's battery current: the brake <b>valve</b> <b>solenoid</b> would then be released and a horn sounded in the cab. The driver was then expected to cancel the warning and apply the brakes under his own control.|$|E

5000|$|The main use of {{the unit}} is to flatten out {{deformed}} press belts whilst simultaneously stress-relieving the belt material. The small size and low weight makes the unit flexible to use and easy to bring into and operate in field situations. All of the equipment needed (excluding the carriage frame and the air compressor) can be packed into a box with dimensions of about: 350mm L * 350mm W * 320mm. Total weight including blaster, valve, air hose and miscellaneous components is around 25kg and the blasting machine itself weights only 9kg. One pair of universal channel (38mm * 76mm [...] ) must be provided on site - the length usually being 500mm longer than the belt width. The channels are welded together so that the blaster can easily run through the frame {{across the face of}} the belt. The total installation time, including the manufacture of the carriage frame, is limited to just a few hours after which the peening process can begin. On the inlet air hose an electric shut-off valve is mounted to protect the belt from over-blasting should the belt suddenly stop during the blasting operation. To be effective the <b>valve</b> <b>solenoid</b> must be connected / interlocked to the press machine's power supply (240 V). For best blasting results an air supply of 4200 litre per min is required at a pressure of 6 bar. A flexible air hose is supplied with the unit which is to be connected between the blasting unit and the local air supply. All local supply pipes should have a minimum bore diameter of 1". The recommended shot blasting medium is tungsten shot (beads) with diameter ranging from 0.2-0.4 mm having a hardness exceeding 40 HRC. The machine operates by drawing a quantity of tungsten shot {{from the bottom of the}} scroll case into the high velocity nozzles. The shot is blasted onto the surface of the belt and most of the shot bounces back into the scroll case. The air is vented through the filter socks and any shot carried with the air is filtered out and drops back into the scroll case.|$|E

40|$|A {{production}} common rail-type injector {{has been}} investigated via numerical simulation and experimentation. The functioning principle of the injector has been carefully analyzed so as to obtain a mathematical model of the device. A zero-dimensional approach {{has been used for}} modeling the injector, thus considering the variables as function of time only. The analysis of the hydraulic part of the injector resulted in the definition of an equivalent hydraulic scheme, on which basis both the equations of continuity in chambers and flow through nozzles were written. The connecting pipe between common rail and injector, as well as the injector internal line, were modeled according to a onedimensional approach. The moving mechanical components of the injector, such as needle, pressure rod, and control valve have been modeled using the mass-spring-damper scheme, thus obtaining the equation governing their motion. An electromagnetic model of the control <b>valve</b> <b>solenoid</b> has also been realized, in order to work out the attraction force on the anchor, generated by the electric current when flowing into its coil. The model obtained has been implemented using the MATLAB® toolbox SIMULINK®; the ordinary differential equations were solved by means of an implicit scheme of the second-order accuracy, suitable for problems with high level of stiffness, while the partial differential equations were integrated using the finite-difference Lax-Friedrichs method. The experimental investigation on the common-rail injection system was performed on a test bench at some standard test conditions. Electric current flowing through the injector coil, oil pressure in the common rail and at the injector inlet, injection rate, needle lift, and control valve lift were gauged and recorded during several injection phases. The mean reflux-flow rate and the mean quantity of fuel injected per stroke were also measured. Temperature and pressure of the feeding oil as well as pressure in the rail were continuously controlled during the experimental test. The numerical and experimental results were compared. Afterwards, the model was used to investigate the effect of control volume feeding and discharge holes and of their inlet fillet, as well as the effect of the control volume capacity, on the injector performance...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Incremental {{threshold}} loading (ITL) {{is a test}} of inspiratory muscle performance {{which is}} usually performed by breathing through a weighted inspiratory plunger, the load on the inspiratory muscles being increased by externally adding weights to the intake valve. This is not a true threshold device and may be inaccurate. This method was compared with a true threshold device consisting of a <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> which only opens to supply air at a predetermined negative mouth pressure. METHODS [...] Six naive, normal subjects (three men and three women) aged 22 - 24 years underwent three tests using each system. The inspiratory loads were increased every minute by equivalent amounts, - 10 cm H 2 O with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> and by 50 g with the weighted plunger, until the subjects could not inspire or sustain inspiration for a full minute. Six experienced subjects (four men and two women) aged 23 - 41 years were subsequently randomised to perform ITL with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve,</b> twice with the breathing pattern fixed and twice free. RESULTS [...] The <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> generated a more accurate mouth pressure response and was less variable at higher loads than the weighted plunger. The work performed (expressed as the pressure-time product) was less with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> but was more reproducible. ITL with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> was not influenced by controlling the breathing pattern of the subjects. CONCLUSIONS [...] The <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> has several features that make it superior to the weighted plunger as a device for ITL. It generates a more accurate mouth pressure response which is less variable at higher loads. Increases in load are smoother and quicker to introduce. ITL with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> is not influenced by varying breathing patterns and does not require any external regulation...|$|R
