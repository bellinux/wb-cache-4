50|$|Koi {{are very}} hardy. With proper care, they resist {{many of the}} parasites that affect more {{sensitive}} tropical fish species, such as Trichodina, Epistylis, and Ichthyophthirius multifiliis infections. Water pH is important for maintaining koi's health. Water changes help {{reduce the risk of}} diseases and keep koi not stressed. Two of the biggest health concerns among koi breeders are the koi herpes virus (KHV) and rhabdovirus carpio, which causes spring <b>viraemia</b> of carp (SVC). No treatment is known for either disease. Some koi farms in Israel use the KV3 vaccine, developed by Prof. M. Kotler from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and produced by Kovax, to immunise fish against KHV. Israel is currently the only country in the world to vaccinate koi against the KHV. The vaccine is injected into the fish when they are under one year old, and is accentuated by using an ultraviolet light. The vaccine has a 90% success rate and when immunized, the fish cannot succumb to a KHV outbreak and neither can the immunised koi pass KHV onto other fish in a pond. Only biosecurity measures such as prompt detection, isolation, and disinfection of tanks and equipment can prevent the spread of the disease and limit the loss of fish stock. In 2002, spring <b>viraemia</b> struck an ornamental koi farm in Kernersville, North Carolina, and required complete depopulation of the ponds and a lengthy quarantine period. For a while after this, some koi farmers in neighboring states stopped importing fish for fear of infecting their own stocks.|$|E
50|$|Cache Valley Virus is {{the most}} common Orthobunyaviruse in North America, and while {{isolated}} in 1956, was only linked to disease in Texas in 1987 during a large occurrence of aborted and malformed lambs in a sheep flock. The virus does not only infect sheep, however, as In 2002 a survey conducted in 22 states showed 28% of cattle expressed specific antibodies to CVV. Other serological surveys have also shown antibodies to CVV in domestic and wild ruminants, along with horses. Of wild ruminants, deer have a very high seroprevalence. With <b>viraemia</b> lasting 1 to 3 days, they are easily able to spread the virus to vectors including Culicoides midges and Aedes, Anopheles, Coquillettidia and Culiseta group mosquitoes. Therefore, deer tend to act as amplifying hosts to the virus.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{decrease}} <b>viraemia</b> {{levels in}} primary HIV infection {{by using a}} combination of zidovudine (ZDV) and L- 697, 661. DESIGN: Four primary HIV-infected patients were treated for 6 months with ZDV, 250 mg twice daily, in association with the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor L- 697, 661 500 mg three times daily. <b>Viraemia,</b> proviral DNA, CD 4 and CD 8 cell counts were measured serially during 18 months. RESULTS: <b>Viraemia</b> decreased to undetectable levels (< 200 RNA copies/ml) in two patients. A third patient had a marked decrease followed by a rebound during therapy; <b>viraemia</b> levels did not vary markedly in the fourth patient. A rebound in <b>viraemia</b> levels was observed within 15 days of discontinuation of therapy in the three responding patients. Proviral levels evolved in parallel with <b>viraemia</b> but were always detectable in all patients. In the three patients with an initial decrease of <b>viraemia,</b> CD 4 cell counts were within the normal range 2 months after initiation of therapy and did not markedly decrease after discontinuation of therapy. In the two patients with partial or no response of <b>viraemia,</b> mutations associated with low level of resistance to L- 697, 661 appeared during treatment. CONCLUSION: A marked decrease of <b>viraemia</b> can be achieved in some primary HIV-infected patients with combined therapy.

40|$|Laurence Meyera {{on behalf}} of the CASCADE CollaborationM Objectives: To {{identify}} factors associated with sustained undetectable <b>viraemia</b> after HIV- 1 seroconversion in treatment-naive patients, and to describe concomitant CD 4 cell count progression. Methods: Seroconverters enrolled in CASCADE were assumed to control <b>viraemia</b> if at least two consecutive viral load measurements were < 400 / 500 copies/ml without treatment. Factors associated with undetectable <b>viraemia</b> were identified through a logistic regression. A joint model was used to describe simultaneously the CD 4 cell count progression during and after that period and to identify factors associated with sustained undetectable <b>viraemia.</b> Results: Of 2176 seroconverters, 145 (6. 7 %) spontaneously controlled <b>viraemia.</b> Women were {{more likely than men to}} achieve undetectable <b>viraemia</b> [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 2. 12; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 49 – 3. 12] unlike patients who reported a symptomatic primary infection (adjusted OR, 0. 58; 95 % CI, 0. 36 – 0. 94). AIDS and death rates were significantly lower in patients achieving undetectable <b>viraemia</b> than in the others. The median period of undetectable <b>viraemia</b> was 11. 2 months; on average, CD 4 cell counts remained stable during that period, and decreased with a mean rate of 5 cells/ml per month thereafter. High CD 4 cell count at the beginning of undetectable <b>viraemia</b> and non-symptomatic primary infection favoured the preservation of undetectable <b>viraemia.</b> Conclusion: A small proportion of seroconverters appeared to be able to control HIV <b>viraemia</b> spontaneously, mostly those without seroconversion illness and within a few years following seroconversion; this is associated with the benefits of slower CD 4 cell count decline and improved long-term prognosis.

40|$|Introduction: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <b>viraemia</b> is {{associated}} with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and lymphoproliferative diseases. In HIV- 1 infection, persistent EBV <b>viraemia</b> is a common phenomenon. The underlying mechanism of these high EBV DNA loads has not been clarified. We studied EBV <b>viraemia</b> during primary HIV- 1 infection (PHI) to explore the mechanism of EBV <b>viraemia</b> in HIV- 1 infection. Methods: Patients with PHI, participating in Primo-SHM study, a clinical trial with three study arms: no treatment, 24 weeks of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and 60 weeks of cART, were sampled longitudinally during PHI and 24 and 48 weeks thereafter. EBV DNA was assayed by PCR on stored samples of lysed whole blood. Results: 39 patients were tested, in 22 of whom EBV DNA was detected at one or more time points. All patients tested positive for anti-VCA and anti-EBNA antibodies, most patients that had EBV <b>viraemia</b> did not receive cART or interrupted cART. The prevalence of EBV <b>viraemia</b> at baseline was 29 %, 18 % and 33 % for the untreated, 24 weeks cART and continuous cART groups. At week 48, these percentages were 38, 64 and 17 respectively (p &# 60;&#x 200 A; 0. 05). Individual concentrations of EBV DNA for the three groups are shown in Figure 1. Conclusion: Intermittent EBV <b>viraemia</b> is highly prevalent in patients with PHI. Assuming that patients with very early HIV- 1 infection are still immunocompetent, this indicates that EBV <b>viraemia</b> is not caused by immunodeficiency. Antiretroviral therapy started during PHI but not later during chronic HIV infection might reduce the prevalence of EBV <b>viraemia</b> in HIV- 1 infection...|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} polymerase {{chain reaction}} (PCR) assay for hepatitis C viral RNA (HCV-RNA) was used to monitor <b>viraemia</b> levels in six patients at multiple time points before, during, and after interferon therapy for chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH). Prior to therapy, serum HCV-RNA was detected in all patients at approximately 10 (4) - 10 (5) HCV genomes/ml. HCV <b>viraemia</b> became undetectable within 1 month of commencing interferon {{in three of the}} five patients whose alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels decreased to normal on therapy. In the remaining two responder patients, <b>viraemia</b> levels declined more slowly, becoming undetectable after a period of several months. Recurrence of <b>viraemia</b> during therapy was observed in two cases. The one patient whose serum ALT levels remained elevated throughout therapy showed no decline in <b>viraemia.</b> On stopping interferon after a 6 months course, HCV genome titres climbed rapidly in all patients, reaching higher levels than had been observed prior to therapy.

40|$|The {{magnitude}} {{and duration of}} dengue <b>viraemia</b> were studied in 153 patients with naturally acquired dengue infection in Jakarta, Indonesia. The duration of <b>viraemia</b> ranged from 2 to 12 days, but most patients had detectable circulating virus for 4 - 5 days. Accurate measurement of peak virus titres was not possible for many patients because of late admission to the hospital. Composite pictures of <b>viraemia</b> for each serotype, however, showed that many patients infected with dengue 1, 2, or 3 had circulating virus titres ranging from barely detectable to over 108 MID 50 per ml for 3 - 5 days. Virus titres in patients infected with dengue 4 were about 100 -fold lower. Dengue haemagglutination-inhibition antibody titres of 80 or less {{had little effect on}} <b>viraemia,</b> but antibody titres of 160 or greater were associated with a decrease in virus isolation rate and in virus titre. The duration and magnitude of <b>viraemia</b> did not vary significantly with the severity of the disease and was only slightly higher in patients classified as primary dengue infections than in those classified as secondary infections.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} whether early changes in <b>viraemia</b> {{in response to}} didanosine (ddI) predict death and occurrence of new AIDS-defining events. METHODS: Forty-three patients were followed during ddI treatment with sequential determinations of serum <b>viraemia,</b> mutations associated with drug resistance, CD 4 counts and clinical evaluation. Patients were stratified into two groups of equal size, responders and nonresponders, using the median of individual changes in <b>viraemia</b> 1 month after initiation of ddI therapy. RESULTS: After 1 month of ddI, mean <b>viraemia</b> decreased by 0. 35 log RNA copies/ml of serum (P < 0. 001) in the population. A significant difference in survival (median, 14 and 35 months in nonresponders and responders, respectively; log rank, P = 0. 004) and in the delay to the occurrence of new AIDS-defining events (median, 8 and 33 months in nonresponders and responders, respectively; log rank, P = 0. 018) was observed. After stratification for presence of AIDS before starting ddI, <b>viraemia</b> response at 1 month remained predictive of both overall and AIDS-defining event-free survival (log rank, P = 0. 0006 and P = 0. 01). After a similar stratification for initial CD 4, <b>viraemia</b> response still predicted overall survival (log rank, P = 0. 009), but its predictive value for AIDS-defining event-free survival did not reach statistical significance (P = 0. 12). High initial levels of HIV RNA, presence of mutation 215 or previous duration of zidovudine therapy were not predictive of survival. CONCLUSIONS: In patients treated with ddI, changes in <b>viraemia</b> at 1 month predict survival independently of initial AIDS diagnosis and initial CD 4 counts...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesGB virus C (GBV-C) {{infection}} {{is associated with}} delayed mortality in HIV-infected people in most, but not all, studies. Previous investigations {{of the effect of}} GBV-C <b>viraemia</b> on response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) were inconclusive. To determine the effect of GBV-C on ART, we retrospectively analysed plasma samples taken from patients in a prospective randomized clinical trial of ART in HIV-positive Brazilians. MethodsGBV-C <b>viraemia</b> was characterized by testing stored serum samples from 175 participants by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Subjects were randomized to receive indinavir (n= 59), zidovudine and lamivudine (n= 58), or zidovudine, lamivudine and indinavir (n= 58). the effect of GBV-C <b>viraemia</b> on the average change in HIV viral load and CD 4 count following initiation of therapy was evaluated in a multiple regression analysis. ResultsThe prevalence of GBV-C <b>viraemia</b> was similar to that observed in previous studies (24 %). HIV viral load decreased following ART to a significantly greater extent in patients with GBV-C <b>viraemia</b> (by 0. 48 log(10) HIV- 1 RNA copies/mL, P= 0. 009, adjusting for age, ART group, and baseline CD 4 count). Although {{there was no significant difference}} in change in CD 4 count between individuals with and without GBV-C <b>viraemia</b> overall, CD 4 counts were higher following 48 weeks of therapy in GBV-C viraemic individuals receiving the least potent ART regimen (zidovudine and lamivudine) compared with those without GBV-C infection. ConclusionsGBV-C <b>viraemia</b> is associated with an enhanced reduction of HIV viral load in response to ART. in this study of treatment-naive individuals during 48 weeks of follow up, patients with GBV-C <b>viraemia</b> had reductions in HIV viral load that were approximately 0. 5 log copies/mL greater than those found in patients without GBV-C <b>viraemia.</b> This is similar to reductions observed with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

40|$|Objective: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the <b>viraemia</b> pattern of common latent and persistent viruses is ubiquitous to immunodeficiency in general, and can therefore serve as surrogate marker of immunocompetence. Design: A cross-sectional case-control design was used. The elderly, HIV and blood donor cohorts were recruited from Kumasi Teaching Hospital, Ghana, and the autoimmune archived samples from Addenbrooke’s hospital, UK. Results: Common <b>viraemia</b> profiles were shared between HIV- 1 and age-related immunodeficiency. EBV had significant OR of reactivation in the elderly, and all stages of HIV, while CMV was only relevant to the elderly and AIDS patients. Detection in either cellular or plasma fraction was informative of reactivation of EBV only. Although no <b>viraemia</b> was detected for VZV, there was a significant increase in seroprevalence suggestive of reactivation in all HIV stages and in the elderly. B 19 V <b>viraemia</b> was specific to the elderly, while HBV (OBI) and GBV-C <b>viraemia</b> and indirect evidence of possible HHV- 8 reactivation (increased seroprevalence) were specific only to HIV. In the autoimmune cohorts there was a complete absence of <b>viraemia,</b> and no significant change in seroprevalence for any virus screened. Although below significance there was a trend of anti-VZV antibody loss in the ANCA-associated small vessel vasculitis, additionally past-exposure to GBV-C was only observed in Microscopic Polyangitis. Conclusions: While evidence for the hypothesis of generality of reactivation of persistent viruses was apparently unfounded, as GBV-C and HBV were specific for HIV and B 19 V specific for the elderly, there was however some evidence for a general reactivation profile (in Ghana) of the latent herpesviruses, with EBV and CMB showing significant reactivation (<b>viraemia)</b> and potential VZV reactivation suggested by increased seroprevalence.

40|$|The immune {{response}} against {{foot-and-mouth disease virus}} (FMDV) was studied in a murine model. In untreated control mice, the inoculation of 10, 000 suckling mouse 50 % lethal doses of Ol Campos FMDV i. p. {{was followed by a}} burst of <b>viraemia</b> that disappeared in less than 4 days, i. e. when the neutralizing antibodies (NAb) reached titres above one neutralizing unit. In mice treated with cyclophosphamide, the curves of <b>viraemia</b> and NAb were significantly delayed. Nu/nu mice injected with FMDV had curves of <b>viraemia</b> and NAb identical to those of their nu/t littermates. We then studied the secondary (memory) immune reaction in the same model. In order to investigate which preimmunized cells participate in the elimination of actively replicating FMDV, mice were irradiated, then infected with FMDV, and 24 hr later repopulated with cells obtained from either donor mice that had been previously immunized by infection with live virus, or non-infected controls. The transfer of control (non-immunized) lymphoid cells was unable to eliminate the <b>viraemia</b> in recipient animals at times significantly different from those observed with irradiated recipients receiving no cells, while repopulation of recipients with 10 (8) immune lymphoid cells (obtained from pooled thymus, blood, peritoneal exudate, spleen and lymph nodes of preinfected donor mice) led to undetectable titres of <b>viraemia</b> at Day 5 post-infection (p. i.). High doses of thymus cells were totally inactive, while a few as 10 (7) donor spleen cells were able to abort <b>viraemia</b> at 6 days p. i. When enriched preparations of B or T spleen cells were adoptively transferred, only B cells were able to abort <b>viraemia</b> in irradiated recipients. It is concluded that, in the murine model of FMDV infection, B cells are mainly responsible for primary response and short-term immunological memory.

HCV specific humoral and cellular immune responses {{in patients with}} and without <b>viraemia</b> were investigated. Methods-In vitro T helper (T-H) lymphocyte responses to structural and nonstructural HCV proteins were determined by means of proliferative response and cytokine production in 35 anti-HCV positive/HCV RNA negative patients and in 31 patients with chronic HCV infection and persistent <b>viraemia.</b> Humoral responses were determined by measuring Hcv specific antibody quantity and specificity. Results-A T-H response to two or HCV proteins was present in 18 of 35 patients with serological viral clearance compared with just one of 31 viraemic patients (p = 0. 00001). HCV specific interferon-gamma production was increased only in the former group. In contrast, the antibody levels were significantly lower and directed at fewer HCV antigens in patients with undetectable HCV RNA. Conclusions-Patients without <b>viraemia</b> after HCV infection frequently have strong T-H lymphocyte responses of the T(H) 1 type to multiple HCV antigens many years after the onset of infection, whereas antibody responses are less marked. These results suggest that control of HCV replication may depend on effective T-H lymphocyte activation...|$|E
