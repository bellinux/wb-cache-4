40|$|The {{study of}} {{vibrations}} in agriculture is perforated {{to assess the}} efficiency of machinery, lifetime of components, drivers' comfort, damage of crop during harvest and transport. An important source of vibrations is the soil. Owing to the stochastic character and visco-elastic behaviour of the soil, {{it is very difficult}} to create repeatable testing conditions. Experiments on <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> <b>rigs,</b> also called shakers, in combination with time waveform replication (TWR) can solve this problem. The objective of TWR is to determine the inputs to the shakers in order to obtain the same sensor readings as during the field experiments. The classical TWR method consists of an iterative procedure that can be time consuming. This paper presents a feedback approach, thereby reducing the number of iterations. As in general, several sensor signals need to be reproduced, a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) controller needs to be designed, which is often a time consuming and difficult process. A methodology based on static decoupling is introduced such that the MIMO controller design reduces to the synthesis of several single-input, single-output (SISO) controllers. Experiments on a tractor indicate that with the present procedure, compared to the classical TWR procedure, the number of iterations can be reduced and a better accuracy can be achieved.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the dynamic {{parameter}} {{identification of the}} novel fatigue-testing rig is presented. The applied identification method assumes a priori a simple dynamical model for which parameters are identified through free and forced <b>vibration</b> <b>tests.</b> The <b>rig</b> is comprised of two base excited oscillators providing the dynamic excitation for a fatigue sample and two pneumatic actuators preventing a loss of contact between the oscillators and the sample. The actuators introduce strong nonlinearities. All parameters of the system apart from the pneumatic actuators identified through the free <b>vibration</b> <b>tests</b> using the linear model were in a good agreement with those obtained by the frequency analysis. Two models, a linear and the nonlinear with Coulomb friction, were dynamically interrogated by a random excitation. It was shown that the stiffness coefficient a, increases linearly with the pressure in the pneumatic cylinders, and the viscous damping coefficient b increases quadratically with the air pressure in the pneumatic cylinders. The predicted responses for the linear and nonlinear models correlate well with the experimental data. JRC. F. 4 -Safety of future nuclear reactor...|$|R

The parametric distance is defined as the Euclidean distance between the vector of parameters of an unknown fault and the vector of parameters of known faults obtained from the learning stage. Since the vectors are defined in a hyperspace spanned by the parameters of the identified time-series model, the parametric distance is definitely metric.

40|$|A {{flexible}} shaft {{is prone to}} a number of vibration phenomena which occur at frequencies other than synchronous with rotational speed. Nonsynchronous vibrations from several sources were observed while running a <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> designed to simulate the operation of a supercritical power transmission shaft.

Advantages and limitations of existing methods are presented. Most of these methods give insufficient results when dealing either with significant variations of the rotational speed or with signals of relatively complex spectral characteristic. In order to overcome these obstacles, a new two-step method for instantaneous frequency estimation is proposed. The described method is based on principles of phase demodulation and joint time-frequency analysis, taking advantage of both of them. The paper presents the method and the algorithm for its implementation on {{the example of a}} simulated <b>vibration</b> signal.

40|$|The multivariable {{tracking}} accuracy on an automotive <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> {{can be improved}} by extending the current industrial off-line iterative feedforward procedure with a real-time multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) feedback controller. This paper shows that for the considered 4 x 4 application, the two most common approaches, namely full MIMO identification and mu-synthesis {{on one hand and}} decentralised control on the other hand fail to design a robust MIMO controller with acceptable performance. Therefore, a control design based on static decoupling is applied. This is a combination of (1) a transformation of the inputs and the outputs to decouple the system, and (2) independent single-input-single-output (SISO) controllers designed for the diagonal elements of the transformed system, using standard SISO identification and fl (infinity) -techniques. To optimise the closed-loop performance, a new decoupling algorithm is developed. The new presented algorithm outperforms the existing decoupling algorithms, yielding satisfactory multivariable closed-loop performance. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal of these tests is to replicate or track real operating conditions in lab environment typically on a multi-axis <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig.</b> The wave forms that have to be tracked are repeated sequentially for a certain number of cycles or until failure occurs. Existing techniques to replicate these sequences consist of fixed position controllers for the actuators with feedforward approaches; for instance {{the current state of the}} art Time Wave Replication (TWR) process. The TWR process consists of two phases Cuyper_ 2006 _ 1 : Identification of non-parametric frequency domain model and its inverse followed by off-line iterative learning control (ILC) phase. Although TWR is a slow off-line process for finding the appropriate drive signals, it allows to control systems with delays and non-minimum phase, which is typical for hydraulic test rigs. This research proposes an online technique that can also handle systems with delays and non-minimum phase by investigating a combined use of adaptive inverse control (AIC) and ILC.

40|$|In several {{applications}} like paper making machines, fans or wind turbines, {{rolling bearings}} are operated under external mechanical vibrations that cause near-surface fatigue. This hitherto unnoticed loading {{is illustrated by}} case examples. Smoothing of the machining structure reveals mixed friction. Material aging is shifted towards the surface despite almost indentation-free raceways. Two distinct types of residual stress depth profiles occur. The established micro friction model partitions the contact area into sections of different friction coefficients. Additional tangential load then shifts the equivalent stress either closer to or directly on the surface. Orange skin formation on the raceway by plastic deformation and spot-like dark etching regions in the outermost edge zone confirm nonuniform material loading in the contact area. Both types of residual stress profiles are reproduced on a self-developed <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> for grease or oil lubricated rolling bearings.

In this paper an already designed and constructed 6 degrees of freedom (dot) electro-hydraulic <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> is virtually redesigned, constructed and validated using the Stewart configuration as a basis. The former structure has fundamental faults, which prohibit an optimised performance. An important weakness lies in the use of Hook's joints, which are too weak for the exerted forces and introduce an eigenfrequency that lies in the excitation band of the simulator. The aim is to find the optimal angle between ground and cylinder a that provides minimum rotation, force and torque within the Hook's joints, satisfies a number of performance criteria, respects the symmetry of the construction, tries to minimise the asymmetry in the cylinder movement and provides a movement of the platform with high resolution. An inverse kinematics and a dynamic model are constructed. The result is a vibration simulator with great stability and performance. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

An extensive review, covering existing smart materials and their applications, has highlighted that smart materials and structures can be applied to large scale structures. Comprehensive experimental tests have been carried out in order to gain knowledge and data on the dynamic shear properties and behaviour of stiffness change of MRE and MRE cored adaptive sandwich beam structures depending on magnetic fields. Dynamic shear property tests with different curing stages have been enhanced to obtain various properties. The new developed forced <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> enabled forced vibration tests of MRE embedded sandwich beam with various aspects such as different magnetic field strength, various oscillations of force amplitudes, boundary conditions and damping effects under localised magnetic fields to be made. In parallel to these experimental investigations, a new theoretical model was developed by combining the magnetisation effects on iron particles in terms of the curing times. In addition, a new macro scale modelling approach for rubber like materials (nonlinear behaving materials) was made by adopting FEA analysis to obtain the optimum volume of pores and size of iron particles to enhance the performance of MREs. A higher order sandwich beam theory is extended to include damping properties of MRE. It has been demonstrated that a higher order sandwich beam theory appears to be the most versatile and accurate modelling method for a sandwich beam with an MRE core material. The results from higher order theory have been combined with a power flow analysis for the smart floating sandwich raft vibration isolation system.

40|$|The {{nature of}} digital {{hydraulic}} systems may cause pressure pulsation problems. For example, switched inertance hydraulic systems (SIHS), which {{are applied to}} adjust or control flow and pressure by a means that does not rely on dissipation of power, have noise problems due to the pulsed nature of the flow. An effective method to reduce the pulsation is important to improve system performance and increase efficiency. Although passive systems to reduce the noise {{have been shown to}} be effective in many situations, their attenuation frequency range is limited and they may be bulky. Furthermore, attenuation devices based on expansion chambers, accumulators or hoses are likely to be unsuitable for SIHS as they add compliance to the system and would impair the dynamic response. This thesis is concerned with issues relating to the development of an active noise canceller for attenuating the pressure pulsation which is caused primarily by pulsed flow from high-speed valves in SIHS. Active control methods are widely and successfully applied in the area of structureborne noise (SBN) and air-borne noise (ABN) cancellation. The idea is using the intentional superposition of waves to create a destructive interference pattern such that a reduction of the unwanted noise occurs. However, applications for fluid-borne noise (FBN) attenuation based on the ‘Active noise control (ANC) principle’ are rare due to the restriction of the hardware and experimental apparatus in previous researches. In this thesis, an adaptive controller has been developed for active control of pressure pulsation in hydraulic system. The principle of the adaptive LMS filter and details of the controller design are described and the implementation was carried out through simulation. The designed controller was applied on a <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> initially prior to the hydraulic testing in order to investigate its advantages and limitations in practice. Extensive testing on a switched inertance hydraulic rig proved that the controller, which used a piezoelectric valve with fast response and good bandwidth, is effective and that it has several advantages over previous methods, being effective for low frequency cancellation, with a quick response, and is robust and versatile. A novel method for the accurate measurement of unsteady flowrate in a pipe was proposed. This was applied and validated on a pipe, and was shown to give good results. This method solves the difficulty for measuring the unsteady flowrate currently by using easy-measured signals, such as pressures. It can be used widely for predicting the unsteady flowrate along the pipe. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} of the hand to tool-induced vibrations {{is associated with the}} occurrence of debilitating conditions such as vibration white finger. The primary aim of this work is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the effects of different aspects of exposure to finger transmitted vibration (FTV) related to operators using hand-held vibrating tools. To achieve this, firstly, a new method for measuring finger transmitted vibration was developed and assessed, including a tool <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> and measurement protocol. The effect on FTV measurement of using a small accelerometer attached to the back of the finger was investigated using 2 D finite element modelling. Comparisons were also made using a laser vibrometer. Analysis showed that the new test rig is capable of measuring FTV at frequencies ranging from 10 to 400 Hz, under different grip force levels, and that adding a small accelerometer mass (0. 3 grams) did not significantly affect measurements. A human participant study then carried out using the new rig. Various characteristic measurements were collected in tandem, including anthropometry, skin characterisation and behaviour under loading to investigate the effect of different factors on FTV. The results showed that FTV varied among individuals and the key finding was that exposure to vibration has a significant effect on finger temperature even for a short period of testing. Anti-vibration (AV) glove materials were investigated using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and tested using human participants. The results showed that the mechanical properties of AV materials change under real world industrial conditions such as excitation frequencies and temperature. Finally, a new artificial test-bed was developed to replicate the transmitted vibration of the index finger. Studies were conducted on a range of 5 test-beds, to allow comparison with the human measurements, including indentation, vibration transmissibility and FE modelling. FE modelling showed that the distribution of dynamic strain was found to be highest in the vasculature region of the finger, indicating that this could be one of the contributing factors of VWF. One of the finger test-bed was selected as best replicating the mechanical properties of the real finger. The artificial test-bed provided better consistency than human participants, for testing parameters, such as grip force, and can be used in future for testing AV gloves with no need for human subjects. ii Further investigations are suggested to be made to enhance the limitations of this project, including material analysis, testing protocol and finite element modelling.

40|$|The {{studies done}} in this thesis was {{connected}} to an early stage implementation of a new test method for ?nding aerodynamic properties of bridge deck sections at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Department of Structural Engineering. This method is based on wind tunnel measurements of cross sections using a forced vibration principle where the bridge motion is forced by a custom made test rig. The rig performing the forced vibration tests is the ?rst of its kind at NTNU, and can produce motion in three degrees of freedom (horizontal, vertical and rotational), both separately and simultaneously. The forced vibration method is gaining popularity as it introduces a variety of possibilities in terms of aerodynamic testing. The main goal of these studies {{was to develop a}} process of building bridge section models compatible with the forced <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> and suited for early stage testing of cross section design. Furthermore, it was an objective to do wind tunnel testing of the crafted section models, and to analyze the output from the testing in terms of data quality and aerodynamic properties. The objectives were pursued in a four stage process. Theory studies and a series of calculations and material tests led to the design of two bridge sections strong and sti? enough to withstand the wind tunnel loading. The building process was performed at the department lab where all the design solutions were implemented. A series of forced vibration test were performed in the wind tunnel at NTNU, Department of Energy and Process Engineering (EPT), and the outputs from the tests were post processed and analyzed. The work done resulted in a procedure of building models using the equipment available at the department and the materials found suitable. This includes a com- prehensive study of the individual material properties as well as the properties of the model as a whole. The possible designs of choice were thoroughly assessed, and this led to a choice of two section model concepts. A rectangular shaped section served as a reference model which was easy to build, while a Twin section became the main model of interest in this thesis. Aerodynamic properties of the models were extracted from data obtained by wind tunnel testing, and a quality assessment con- cerning the performance of the model was completed. Further, a comparing study of the results from the Twin section was performed with a similar bridge concept called Brusymfonien. The section models developed in this thesis were found compatible with the forced vibration rig for the purpose of extracting aerodynamic properties. However, further work is required to increase the accuracy and achieve more stable results. Most important in this matter was shown to be the overall sti?ness of the model...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel bearing <b>test</b> <b>rig.</b> The <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> allows multi-axial static and dynamic loading of a rolling element bearing. Different types and sizes of bearings can be mounted and loaded as if {{built into a}} real machine. The <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> {{will be used to}} analyse the effect of external dynamic loads on the lifetime of these bearings. The aim to apply a dynamic force on the bearing complicates the design considerably. As the measurements should not be influenced by the dynamics of the <b>test</b> <b>rig,</b> all components should be resonance free in the full range of excitation. Therefore, the <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> is developed using FEM software and validated using modal analyses.
