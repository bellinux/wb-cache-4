The YF-23 design was considered stealthier and faster, while the YF-22 was more maneuverable. The aviation press speculated that the YF-22 was also more adaptable to the U.S. Navy's Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), but by 1992, the Navy had abandoned NATF.|$|E

25|$|In {{integrated}} circuit design, physical design {{is a step}} in the standard design cycle which follows after the circuit design. At this step, circuit representations of the components (devices and interconnects) of the design are converted into geometric representations of shapes which, when manufactured in the corresponding layers of materials, will ensure the required functioning of the components. This geometric representation is called {{integrated circuit}} layout. This step is usually split into several sub-steps, which include both design and verification and <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> layout.|$|E

25|$|Antagonistic {{pleiotropy}} is a prevailing theory today, {{but this}} is largely by default, and not because the theory has been well verified. In fact, experimental biologists have looked for the genes that cause ageing, and since about 1990 the technology has been available to find them efficiently. Of the many ageing genes that have been reported, some seem to enhance fertility early in life, or to carry other benefits. But there are other ageing genes for which no such corresponding benefit has been identified. This is not what Williams predicted. This may {{be thought of as}} partial <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theory, but logically it cuts to the core premise: that genetic trade-offs are the root cause of ageing.|$|E
