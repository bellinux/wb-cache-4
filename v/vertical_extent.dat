Summing reflectivities in the Vertically Integrated Liquid or VIL, gives the liquid water content in the cloud.

VIL divided by the <b>vertical</b> <b>extent</b> of the storm, called VIL density, has a relationship with hail size, although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly accurate. Traditionally, hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research. Some algorithms include the height of the freezing level to estimate the melting of the hailstone and what would be left on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The halo ring appears {{brightest}} in forward-scattered light, {{in which}} it was extensively imaged by Galileo. While its surface brightness is much less than that of the main ring, its vertically (perpendicular to the ring plane) integrated photon flux is comparable due to its much larger thickness. Despite a claimed <b>vertical</b> <b>extent</b> of more than , the halo’s brightness is strongly concentrated towards the ring plane and follows a power law of the form z−0.6 to z−1.5, where z is altitude over the ring plane. The halo’s appearance in the back-scattered light, as observed by Keck and HST, is the same. However its total photon flux is several times lower than that of the main ring and is more strongly concentrated near the ring plane than in the forward-scattered light.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{structure}} of the SYNOP code, a maximum of three cloud symbols can be plotted for each reporting station that appears on the weather map. All cloud types are coded and transmitted by trained observers then plotted on maps as low, middle, or high-étage using special symbols for each major cloud type. Any cloud type with significant <b>vertical</b> <b>extent</b> that can occupy more than one étage is coded as low (cumulus and cumulonimbus) or middle (nimbostratus) depending on the altitude level or étage where it normally initially forms aside from any vertical growth that takes place. The symbol used on the map for each of these étages at a particular observation time is for the genus, species, variety, mutation, or cloud motion that is considered most important according to criteria set out by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). If these elements for any étage at the time of observation are deemed to be of equal importance, then the type which is predominant in amount is coded by the observer and plotted on the weather map using the appropriate symbol. Special weather maps in aviation show areas of icing and turbulence.|$|E
40|$|What is {{the natural}} {{reference}} frame for seeing large-scale spatial scenes in locomotor action space? Prior studies indicate an asymmetric angular expansion in perceived direction in large-scale environments: Angular elevation relative to the horizon is perceptually exaggerated {{by a factor of}} 1. 5, whereas azimuthal direction is exaggerated by a factor of about 1. 25. Here participants made angular and spatial judgments when upright or on their sides to dissociate egocentric from allocentric reference frames. In Experiment 1, it was found that body orientation did not affect the magnitude of the up-down exaggeration of direction, suggesting that the relevant orientation reference frame for this directional bias is allocentric rather than egocentric. In Experiment 2, the comparison of large-scale horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>extents</b> was somewhat affected by viewer orientation, but only to the extent necessitated by the classic (5 %) horizontal-vertical illusion (HVI) that is known to be retinotopic. Large-scale <b>vertical</b> <b>extents</b> continued to appear much larger than horizontal ground extents when observers lay sideways. When the visual world was reoriented in Experiment 3, the bias remained tied to the ground-based allocentric reference frame. The allocentric HVI is quantitatively consistent with differential angular exaggerations previously measured for elevation and azimuth in locomotor space.

The depth {{to the center}} of a magma chamber is most probably determined by the density structure of the lithosphere; this process is explained.

Attempts to grow further lead to dike propagation events which reduce the stresses below the critical values of rock failure. The tensile or compressive failure of the walls is discussed with respect to magma migration. The later growth of magma chambers is accomplished by lateral dike injection into the country rocks.

Smith noticed an easterly dip in the beds of rock- small near the surface (about three degrees) then greater after the Triassic rocks which led to him a testable hypothesis, which he termed the principle of faunal succession, and he began to determine if the relationships between the strata and their characteristics were consistent throughout the country.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to compare Wenner and dipole-dipole configurations in delineating an underground cavity at a site near the University of Malaya, Malaysia. A three-dimensional electrical resistivity imaging survey was carried out along seven parallel lines using Wenner and dipole-dipole arrays.

40|$|One {{important}} aspect of the pictorial representation of a scene is the depiction of object proportions.

However, because all of the 3 -D environments were large and all of the 2 -D displays were small, the question remains whether the observed magnitude differences were due solely to the dimensionality of the displays (2 -D versus 3 -D) or to the perceived distal size of the extents (small versus large). We investigated this question by comparing observers' judgments of vertical relative to horizontal extents on a large but 2 -D display compared to the large 3 -D and the small 2 -D displays used by Yang et al (1999). The results confirmed that the magnitude differences for vertical overestimation between display media are influenced more by the perceived distal object size rather than by the dimensionality of the display...|$|R

40|$|Global and {{regional}} climate changes due to black carbon Black carbon in soot {{is the dominant}} absorber of visible solar radiation in the atmosphere. Anthropogenic sources of black carbon, although distributed globally, are most concentrated in the tropics where solar irradiance is highest. Black carbon is often transported over long distances, mixing with other aerosols along the way. The aerosol mix can form transcontinental plumes of atmospheric brown clouds, with <b>vertical</b> <b>extents</b> of 3 to 5 km. Because of the combination of high absorption, a regional distribution roughly aligned with solar irradiance, {{and the capacity to}} form widespread atmospheric brown clouds in a mixture with other aerosols, emissions of black carbon are the second strongest contribution to current global warming, after carbon dioxide emissions. In the Himalayan region, solar heating from black carbon at high elevations may be just as important as carbon dioxide in the melting of snowpacks and glaciers. The interception of solar radiation by atmospheric brown clouds leads to dimming at the Earth’s surface with important implications for the hydrological cycle, and the deposition of black carbon darkens snow and ice surfaces, which can contribute to melting, in particular of Arctic sea ice...|$|R

To date, there are few instances of using inversion methods to characterize the distribution of gas hydrates in deepwater settings so there is great value to industry and academia in applying these techniques to image the distribution of known or suspected buried gas hydrate deposits. Employing inversion methods to characterize gas hydrate deposits, if successful in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, would (from the geohazards perspective) be a significant advance for the planning of deepwater exploration and development wells.
