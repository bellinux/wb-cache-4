5|$|Needled by {{repeated}} {{attacks from}} The Morning Chronicle on his supposed indecency, poor taste {{and lack of}} creativity, Etty determined to produce a work that would prove his detractors wrong. The result was The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the <b>Vicious</b> <b>and</b> Intemperate.|$|E
5|$|On the {{confines}} of the island feuds were <b>vicious,</b> <b>and</b> one surgeon went insane. Pirates were frequently seen off Ascension, keeping the garrison on edge. Nicolls was also busied by many infrastructure projects on the island, building roads, water tanks, a storehouse, and developing the gardens on Green Mountain. For these efforts, Nicolls had about sixty freed Africans sent to Ascension, and additionally asked for convicts.|$|E
5|$|Following the breakup, {{the former}} {{partners}} feuded {{for a while}} with Bagwell getting the better of Riggs. Riggs {{would go on to}} briefly feud with Raven, later joining The Flock, while Bagwell formed <b>Vicious</b> <b>and</b> Delicious with Scott Norton before suffering a severe neck injury that kept him out of action for a while. Bagwell later returned to WCW, teaming with Shane Douglas to win another tag team championship. After losing the championship, he formed another tag team, pairing with Lex Luger to form Totally Buffed.|$|E

5|$|The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the <b>Vicious</b> <b>and</b> Intemperate, {{also known}} as The Destroying Angel and Daemons Inflicting Divine Vengeance on the Wicked and Intemperate and The Destruction of the Temple of Vice, is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1832. Etty had become famous for nude paintings, and acquired a reputation for tastelessness, indecency {{and a lack of}} creativity. With The Destroying Angel he hoped to disprove his critics with an openly moral piece. The painting is 127.8cm by 101.9cm (50in by 40in) and depicts a classical temple under attack from a destroying angel and a group of daemons. Some of the human occupants are dead or unconscious, others flee in terror or struggle helplessly against the daemons.|$|E
5|$|After {{the ruler}} of the other {{dimensional}} realm Outworld, Shao Kahn, conquered the realm of Edenia and merged it with his own, he decided he would keep the former king's daughter Kitana alive and raise her as his own. Though she grew up knowing nothing of her origin, the emperor nonetheless feared that one day Kitana would discover her true parentage and turn against him, and so he ordered Shang Tsung to bring to life a more <b>vicious</b> <b>and</b> loyal version of Kitana that could take her place if necessary. This was done by fusing her essence with a Tarkatan warrior from Baraka's race. The process was not a complete success, however, as the hybrid clone was disfigured with the hideous mouth of the Tarkata. Instead of replacing Kitana, as originally planned, Mileena {{would be used to}} spy on her and to ensure her allegiance to him, and so Shao Kahn introduced Mileena to Kitana as her supposedly lost twin sister. The two thus grew up together as his daughters and elite personal assassins, although Mileena grew to harbor a great bitterness and jealousy towards Kitana, whom Kahn favored over her.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} several months, Sting feuded with Goldberg, Rick Steiner, <b>Vicious,</b> <b>and</b> Savage. Sting teamed with WCW World Heavyweight Champion Nash at the Bash at the Beach in July to take on <b>Vicious</b> <b>and</b> Savage of Team Madness. Savage pinned Nash and won the World title as a result. Hogan {{returned}} from injury on July 12 as a face to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Sting defeated Flair on the July 19 edition of Nitro to become the on-screen president of WCW. Later that night, Nash turned heel by attacking Hogan during a title defense against Vicious. Sting remained president for just one week and used his power to book a main event pitting Hogan and himself against Nash and Vicious. Sting vacated the presidency the following week because he only wanted Flair out of the position rather than wanting the power for himself. Along with Goldberg, Sting and Hogan feuded with Nash, <b>Vicious</b> <b>and</b> Rick Steiner for the next month.|$|E

25|$|Of little {{strategic}} value, {{the mountainous}} State of Scott {{was not the}} site of any fighting on a major scale during the Civil War, instead seeing mostly guerrilla warfare, bushwhacking, and skirmishing, which was often of a very <b>vicious</b> <b>and</b> violent nature.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} was between Sid <b>Vicious</b> <b>and</b> Scott Steiner for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The match started {{back and forth}} until they went outside the ring, and Midajah, who {{accompanied}} Steiner, attacked Vicious with a lead pipe. Steiner attacked Vicious with a steel chair, and gained the advantage, applying the Steiner Recliner. Vicious fought back after Midajah accidentally performed a diving crossbody to Steiner. Vicious performed a chokeslam, and applied the cobra clutch. Midajah distracted <b>Vicious,</b> <b>and</b> allowed Steiner to attack him with the lead pipe. Jarrett came out, and accidentally hit Steiner with his guitar. Steiner fought back with a low blow and a T-Bone suplex. Steiner made Vicious pass out with the Steiner Recliner to win the match, and retain the title.|$|E

25|$|A second notable {{hotel on}} the street, the Hotel Chelsea, was built between 1883 and 1885, with the first {{portions}} opening in 1884. It was New York's tallest building until 1902.

25|$|Guthrie {{represented}} Louisville at the Kentucky Constitutional Convention of 1849. The delegates chose him president over Whig Archibald Dixon.

The Kentucky Constitution of 1850 included protections for slave property, and stipulated that no amendments to the constitution could be proposed {{for a period of}} eight years.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, the United States has {{not been}} {{receptive}} {{to the idea that}} a dog, itself, can be criminally liable. A California court explained that, although the tendency to anthropomorphize animals is understandable, especially with beloved pets like dogs, the law does not recognize dogs as having the mental state that can incur criminal liability. That is, although dogs and other animals may have the capacity to commit <b>vicious</b> <b>and</b> violent acts, they do not possess the legal ability to commit crimes.|$|E
25|$|Depictions of rats {{in fiction}} are {{historically}} inaccurate and negative. The most common falsehood is the squeaking almost always heard in otherwise realistic portrayals (i.e. nonanthropomorphic). While the recordings {{may be of}} actual squeaking rats, the noise is uncommon – they may do so only if distressed, hurt, or annoyed. Normal vocalizations are very high-pitched, well outside the range of human hearing. Rats are also often cast in <b>vicious</b> <b>and</b> aggressive roles when in fact, their shyness helps keep them undiscovered for so long in an infested home.|$|E
