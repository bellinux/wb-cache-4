In 2012, the Irish Independent Newspaper credited him with having saved more than 6,500 {{people during the}} war.

Giovanni Ferrofino is credited with saving 10,000 Jews. Acting on secret orders from Pope Pius XII, Ferrofino obtained visas from the Portuguese Government and the Dominican Republic to secure their escape from Europe and sanctuary in the Americas. Pius provided funds to the Jewish refugees of Fiume saved by Giovanni Palatucci and to other rescue operations - to the French Capuchin Pierre-Marie Benoit of Marseille and others. When Archbishop Archbishop Giovanni Montini (later Pope Paul VI) was offered an award for his rescue work by Israel, {{he said he had}} only been acting on the orders of Pius XII.|$|E

2500|$|He wrote a {{dissertation}} {{focusing on}} the historian Arnold J. Toynbee and would return to that subject in his later years. In 1951, he [...] "signed up to become a parish priest in one of New York’s poorest neighborhoods—Washington Heights, on {{the northern tip of}} Manhattan, then a barrio of fresh-off-the-airplane Puerto Rican immigrants." [...] In 1956, at the age of 30, he was appointed as the <b>vice</b> <b>rector</b> of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, [...] "a position he managed to keep for several years before getting thrown out—Illich was just a little too loud in his criticism of the Vatican’s pronouncements on birth control and comparatively demure silence about the bomb."

2500|$|At times, various vice Rectors of the Josephinum (the apostolic {{delegate}} to the United States was the nominal rector) would feel under the gun {{to clamp down on}} the student's access to [...] "worldly literature." [...] One such episode occurred after a visit of Bishop Joseph Mark McShea of Allentown, PA that led to a new <b>vice</b> <b>Rector,</b> Ralph Thompson, and some strict new rules, among them a [...] "book policy" [...] that limited what students could read. [...] Beyond spiritual and classroom books, students had to have a permission slip signed by a professor for any book in their college rooms. [...] One college student went to see Fick and asked him to sign a slip for John Dos Passos' trilogy [...] "USA" [...] and with great sadness Fick told him that while he was greatly pleased that this student wanted to read such a great work of American literature in three volumes, he didn't want his signature on a permission slip for such an author given the repressive atmosphere then in place at the Josephinum. [...] Fick sadly told the student to wait until summer, buy the book and read it during the vacation period. [...] Former Fick students who appreciated Fick's love of literature can only imagine what it took out of him to thus deny a student who wanted to read a good book. [...] This experience in censorship and mild repression had a profound influence on some students who never forgot what a powerful institution can do to an individual's spirit and went on to fight various institutions throughout their lives remembering Fick's resignation to powers over which a young English teacher had little influence.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the perspectives of Ghanaian <b>rectors,</b> <b>vice</b> <b>rectors</b> and quality assurance officers’ on quality assurance, their origins and their quality assurance strategies. Underpinned by symbolic interactionism, a qualitative methodological approach via in-depth interviewing of twenty key informants and document {{analysis was used to}} establish how they defined their situations and addressed problematic situations in quality assurance. The findings revealed that respondents’ quality assurance perspectives had internal and external dimensions. Their internal quality assurance perspectives covered human resources, teaching and learning, and management whilst their external quality assurance perspective focused on institutional, national and global contexts. These embraced achieving institutional goals, delivering quality programmes, achieving national development, protecting national economic interest, equipping students with international competencies and enhancing mutual recognition of credentials globally. It emerged that, their perspectives on quality assurance originated from interactions with each other, from group life and reference groups. It was also discovered that their quality assurance strategies focused on staff and students but in different ways. The study concludes by generating substantive and formal propositions on quality assurance in polytechnics and public funded higher education institutions. A recommendation for further research into quality assurance perspectives of vice chancellors, pro-vice chancellors and quality assurance directors of Ghanaian universities is made. A similarly designed study be used to explore how quality assurance rhetoric of <b>rectors,</b> <b>vice</b> <b>rectors</b> and quality assurance officers’ matches the actual institutional experience.

50|$|During {{the early}} history of Cuba, the Catholic clergy seemed to have been the {{principal}} if not the only agents of education. In 1689, the College of San Ambrosio was founded in Havana for the purpose of preparing young men for the priesthood. As early as 1688, the city council of Havana petitioned the royal government to establish a university in that city, in order that young men desirous of pursuing higher studies might not be compelled to go to Europe to do so. After some years of preparation, the present University of Havana was founded in 1728. The <b>rectors,</b> <b>vice</b> <b>rectors,</b> counselors, and secretaries were all Dominicans.|$|R
