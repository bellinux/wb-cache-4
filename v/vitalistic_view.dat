5000|$|The {{founder of}} homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann, {{promoted}} an immaterial, <b>vitalistic</b> <b>view</b> of disease: [...] "...they are solely spirit-like (dynamic) derangements of the spirit-like power (the vital principle) that animates the human body." [...] The view of disease as a dynamic disturbance of the immaterial and dynamic vital force {{is taught in}} many homeopathic colleges and constitutes a fundamental principle for many contemporary practising homeopaths.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 18th and 19th centuries, {{mainstream}} medicine used methods like bloodletting and purging, and administered complex mixtures, such as Venice treacle, {{which was made}} from 64 substances including opium, myrrh, and viper's flesh. These treatments often worsened symptoms and sometimes proved fatal. Hahnemann rejected these practices - which had been extolled for centuries - as irrational and inadvisable;instead, he advocated the use of single drugs at lower doses and promoted an immaterial, <b>vitalistic</b> <b>view</b> of how living organisms function, believing that diseases have spiritual, {{as well as physical}} causes.|$|E
50|$|Nazor {{probably}} {{reached the}} highest scope in poems of so-called pagan phase, published in books of verse Lyrics (Lirika) (1910) and New Poems (Nove pjesme) (1913). Passionately ecstatic, these poems comprise symbols of life, its eternal fertility, pantheistic metamorphoses {{of nature and}} sensual affirmation of love; life prevails for life itself, so life is taken in its whole versatility. <b>Vitalistic</b> <b>view</b> of life and fascination by countryside - Cypress (Čempres), Dionysian Poems (Dionizijske pjesme), Cicada (Cvrčak) and Olive (Maslina), as well as contemplative experience and spiritualizing of natural appearances - Turris eburnea, Notturno, Forest Sleeps (Šuma spava), Trunk (Stablo) and Spider (Pauk), dominate in the heights of that phase, {{and these are the}} heights of Nazor's poetry at all. Poems Cicada, Olive, Notturno and Forest Sleeps belong {{to the top of the}} World poetry.|$|E
40|$|I focus {{first on}} what Hegel understands {{to be the}} {{conceptual}} structure or logical form of life. Then I examine he transition, through chemical processes, from the sphere of the inorganic to that of organic. I shall show that this transition is a logical one that hinges on conceptual inner necessity, not a natural one in which chemical processes actually give rise to living organisms at specific points in time. I claim that Hegel holds neither the <b>vitalistic</b> <b>view</b> that organic life 'emerges' from an essentially lifeless matter {{by means of the}} sudden appearance of a natural productive power of generation, nor the hylozoic view that nature in its temporal existence is everywhere really alive in all its parts...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Hans E. Kincks {{collection of}} schort stories, Flaggermus-vinger: eventyr vestfra (1899). It argues that Kinck {{can be linked}} to the philosophical paradigm and esthetical tradition of vitalism, and that vitalistic ideas are transported to his short stories. To highlight the vitalism in Kinkcs short stories, the thesis takes the basis of a particular literary image, the fiddle. The fiddle plays an important and interesting role in the short story collection. The work is based on close reading of three short stories:"Hvitsymre i utslaatten," "Felen i vilde skogen" and "Fele-Aasmun". Through the examination of the fiddle motif, we can approach an interest for the primitive life forces, as found in the life philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. We will also find a certain type of fiddle music that illustrates a <b>vitalistic</b> <b>view</b> of art. Through the examination of style, character description and thematic, the analyses seek to answer two questions: What {{is the role of the}} fiddle motif? How can we, through the fiddle motif, seize a vitalistic matter of thinking? Among other things the analyzes conclude that that the fiddle motif is used to convey an autonomous, primitive vitality. In Hvitsymre i utslaatten" is the fiddle used as a symbol on the vitalities. In Fele-Aasmun" and Felen i vilde skogen" the fiddle music itself is a declaration of vitality. Despite this, one cannot read Flaggermus-vinger as a idealization of a nietzscheanic vitalism, as the vitalistic worship of life is being questioned through the thematic. Kinck writes himself first and foremost onto the vitalistic field by displaying different sides of the vitality, and also by situating himself in an investigating and scrutinizing manner facing the vitalistic field...|$|E
