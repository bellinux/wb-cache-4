25|$|Generally, gating {{is thought}} to be {{mediated}} by additional structural domains which sense stimuli and in turn open the channel pore. These domains include the RCK domains of BK channels, and <b>voltage</b> <b>sensor</b> domains of voltage gated K+ channels. These domains are thought to respond to the stimuli by physically opening the intracellular gate of the pore domain, thereby allowing potassium ions to traverse the membrane. Some channels have multiple regulatory domains or accessory proteins, which can act to modulate the response to stimulus. While the mechanisms continue to be debated, there are known structures of a number of these regulatory domains, including RCK domains of prokayrotic and eukaryotic channels, pH gating domain of KcsA, cyclic nucleotide gating domains, and voltage gated potassium channels.|$|E
2500|$|KCNE1 slows KCNQ1 {{activation}} several-fold, {{and there}} are ongoing discussions about the precise mechanisms underlying this. [...] In a study in which KCNQ1 <b>voltage</b> <b>sensor</b> movement was monitored by site-directed fluorimetry and also by measuring the charge displacement associated with movement of charges within the S4 segment of the <b>voltage</b> <b>sensor</b> (gating current), [...] KCNE1 was found to slow S4 movement {{so much that the}} gating current was no longer measurable. Fluorimetry measurements indicated that KCNQ1-KCNE1 channel S4 movement was 30-fold slower than that of the well-studied Drosophila Shaker Kv channel. [...] Nakajo and Kubo found that KCNE1 either slowed KCNQ1 S4 movement upon membrane depolarization, or altered S4 equilibrium at a given membrane potential. The Kass lab deduced that while homomeric KCNQ1 channels can open after the movement of a single S4 segment, KCNQ1-KCNE1 channels can only open after all four S4 segments have been activated. [...] The intracellular C-terminal domain of KCNE1 is thought to sit on the KCNQ1 S4-S5 linker, a segment of KCNQ1 crucial for communicating S4 status to the pore and thus control activation.|$|E

2500|$|Potassium {{voltage-gated}} channel, Isk-related family, member 3 (KCNE3), {{also known}} as MinK-related peptide 2 (MiRP2) [...] is a protein that in humans is encoded by the KCNE3 gene. Specific amino acids within the transmembrane segment (V72) and extracellular domain (D54 and D55) of KCNE3 are important for its control of KCNQ1 voltage dependence. D54 and D55 interact electrostatically with R237 in the S4 segment of the KCNQ1 <b>voltage</b> <b>sensor,</b> helping to stabilize S4 in the activated state, which in turn locks open the channel unless the cell is held at a strongly hyperpolarizing (negative) membrane potential. The ability of KCNQ1-KCNE3 channels to remain open at weakly negative membrane potentials permits their activity in non-excitable, polarized epithelial cells {{such as those in}} the intestine.|$|E
2500|$|The α-subunit {{has four}} repeat domains, labeled I through IV, each {{containing}} six membrane-spanning segments, labeled S1 through S6. The highly conserved S4 segment {{acts as the}} channel's <b>voltage</b> <b>sensor.</b> The voltage sensitivity of this channel is due to positive amino acids located at every third position. When stimulated by a change in transmembrane voltage, this segment moves toward the extracellular side of the cell membrane, allowing the channel to become permeable to ions. The ions are conducted through a pore, {{which can be broken}} into two regions. The more external (i.e., more extracellular) portion of the pore is formed by the [...] "P-loops" [...] (the region between S5 and S6) of the four domains. This region is the most narrow part of the pore and is responsible for its ion selectivity. The inner portion (i.e., more cytoplasmic) of the pore is formed by the combined S5 and S6 segments of the four domains. The region linking domains III and IV is also important for channel function. This region plugs the channel after prolonged activation, inactivating it.|$|E
50|$|The <b>voltage</b> <b>sensor</b> domain {{contains}} four transmembrane helices, named S1 through S4. The S4 transmembrane helix {{contains a}} number of positively charged arginine and lysine amino acid residues. Voltage sensitivity in VSPs is generated primarily by these charges in the S4, {{in much the same}} way that voltage-gated ion channels are gated by voltage. When positive charge builds up on one side of a membrane containing such voltage sensors, it generates an electric force pressing the S4 in the opposite direction. Changes in membrane potential therefore move the S4 back and forth through the membrane, allowing the <b>voltage</b> <b>sensor</b> to act like a switch. Activation of the <b>voltage</b> <b>sensor</b> occurs at depolarized potentials, i.e.: when the membrane collects more positive charge on the inner leaflet. Conversely, deactivation of the <b>voltage</b> <b>sensor</b> takes place at hyperpolarized potentials, when the membrane collects more negative charge on the inner leaflet. Activation of the <b>voltage</b> <b>sensor</b> increases the activity of the phosphatase domain, while deactivation of the <b>voltage</b> <b>sensor</b> decreases phosphatase activity.|$|E

Hanatoxin and SGTx are tarantula toxins that inhibit activation of Kv channels by interacting with each of the four <b>voltage</b> <b>sensors.</b> In this study we set out to identify the active surface of these toxins by alanine-scanning SGTx and characterizing the interaction of each mutant with the Kv 2. 1 channel. Examination of the concentration dependence for inhibition identified 15 mutants with little effect on the concentration dependence for toxin inhibition of the Kv 2. 1 channel, and 11 mutants that display moderate to dramatic perturbations. Mapping of these results onto the structure of SGTx identifies one face of the toxin where mutations with pronounced perturbations cluster together, and a backside of the toxin where mutations are well tolerated. The active surface of SGTx contains a ring-like assembly of highly polar residues, with two basic residues that are particularly critical, concentrically arranged around a hydrophobic protrusion containing critical aliphatic and aromatic residues. These results identify the active surface of the toxin and reveal the types of side chains that are important for interacting with <b>voltage</b> <b>sensors...</b>|$|R
40|$|SummaryVoltage-gated ion {{channels}} {{respond to}} changes in membrane potential by movement of their <b>voltage</b> <b>sensors</b> across the electric field between cytoplasmic and extracellular solutions. The principal <b>voltage</b> <b>sensors</b> in these proteins are positively charged S 4 segments. The absolute magnitude of S 4 movement discriminates two competing classes of gating models. In one class, the movement is 25 Å. Here, using tethered charges attached to an S 4 segment, we provide evidence that the electric field falls across a distance of < 4 Å, supporting a model in which the relative movement between S 4 and the electric field is very small...|$|R
40|$|The voltage-sensing S 4 {{segments}} in the sodium channel undergo conformational rearrangements {{in response to}} changes in the electric field. However, it remains unclear whether these structures move independently or in a coordinated manner. Previously, site-directed fluorescence measurements were shown to track S 4 transitions {{in each of the four}} domains (Chanda, B., and F. Bezanilla. 2002. J. Gen. Physiol. 120 : 629 – 645). Here, using a similar technique, we provide direct evidence of coupling interactions between <b>voltage</b> <b>sensors</b> in the sodium channel. Pairwise interactions between S 4 s were evaluated by comparing site-specific conformational changes in the presence and absence of a gating perturbation in a distal domain. Reciprocity of effect, a fundamental property of thermodynamically coupled systems, was measured by generating converse mutants. The magnitude of a local gating perturbation induced by a remote S 4 mutation depends on the coupling strength and the relative equilibrium positions of the two <b>voltage</b> <b>sensors.</b> In general, our data indicates that the movement of all four <b>voltage</b> <b>sensors</b> in the sodium channel are coupled to a varying extent. Moreover, a gating perturbation in S 4 -DI has the largest effect on the activation of S 4 -DIV and vice versa, demonstrating an energetic linkage between S 4 -DI and S 4 -DIV. This result suggests a physical mechanism by which the activation and inactivation process may be coupled in voltage-gated sodium channels. In addition, we propose that cooperative interactions between <b>voltage</b> <b>sensors</b> may be the mechanistic basis for the fast activation kinetics of the sodium channel...|$|R

The macroscopic SR calcium release waveform, obtained from the spark latency histogram and the estimated open time of the channel or channels underlying a spark, exhibits an early peak and rapid marked decline during large depolarizations. For smaller depolarizations, the release waveform exhibits a smaller peak and a slower decline. However, the mean use time and mean amplitude of the individual sparks are quite similar at all test depolarizations and at all times during a given depolarization, indicating that the channel open times and conductances underlying sparks are essentially independent of voltage. Thus, the voltage dependence of SR Ca 2 + release is due to changes in the frequency and pattern of occurrence of individual, voltage-independent, discrete release events...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new technique}} for measuring the capacitor voltages in a modular multilevel converter using a reduced number of <b>voltage</b> <b>sensors.</b> With this technique, the minimum number of <b>voltage</b> <b>sensors</b> per arm is two.

A simple mathematical model is used to estimate all the SM capacitor voltages, and it is then updated whenever there is a new measurement available. An algorithm that enforces the periodic update of the voltage measurements is also presented. The proposed measuring technique highly reduces the number of voltage sensors; hence reducing the complexity and costs of the signal conditioning and data acquisition stages.

Spiroplasma melliferum, a bacterium related to the mycoplasmas, {{was used as a}} target cell. The data show that with respect to growth inhibition, cell deformation and plasma membrane depolarization, the highest efficient peptide remained natural Alm although the minimal inhibitory concentrations of its Leu analogs were within the same range as the parent molecule, except for Alm-dUL P 14 A. Thus, as for the pore-forming activity observed in artificial membranes and for the toxicity towards mammalian cells, proline- 14 proved to be a critical residue for the anti-bacterial activity of alamethicin. Regarding the sodium <b>voltage</b> <b>sensors,</b> their anti-bacterial efficiency was at least 10 times lower although they promoted spiroplasma cell agglutination. The anti-bacterial activities of the peptides were correlated with their pore-forming properties, especially with the apparent and mean number of monomers per conducting aggregate (〈N〉) when both peptide families were considered and, secondly, with mean open times (τo) within each family. This suggests that although they may form ‘raft-like’ structures, the mechanism underlying anti-bacterial activity of Alm and its active analogs, as well as the S 4 L 45 <b>voltage</b> <b>sensors</b> with the S. melliferum plasma membrane, is predominantly through pore-formation according to the ‘barrel-stave’ mechanism...|$|R
