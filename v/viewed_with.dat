5|$|At {{the end of}} the film, Arroway is {{put into}} a {{position}} that she had traditionally <b>viewed</b> <b>with</b> skepticism and contempt: that of believing something with complete certainty, despite being unable to prove it in the face of not only widespread incredulity and skepticism (which she admits that as a scientist she would normally share) but also evidence apparently to the contrary.|$|E
5|$|Boletus pisciodorus {{is similar}} in form to Tylopilus tabacinus. Unlike, T.tabacinus however, B.pisciodorus has spores that are hyaline in mass, and dark {{yellowish}} brown rather than hyaline when <b>viewed</b> <b>with</b> a light microscope. Further, B.pisciodorus has a fishy odor that is apparent in both fresh and dried specimens.|$|E

5|$|Overall Set was <b>viewed</b> <b>with</b> ambivalence, until {{during the}} first {{millennium}} BCE he {{came to be seen}} as a totally malevolent deity. This transformation was prompted more by his association with foreign lands than by the Osiris myth. Nevertheless, in these late times, the widespread temple rituals involving the ceremonial annihilation of Set were often connected with the myth.|$|E

5|$|The {{reliability}} of William Branham's primary source biographical material should be <b>viewed</b> <b>with</b> caution.

5|$|The spores {{are seen}} ochre-brown in mass, but pale yellow when <b>viewed</b> <b>with</b> a light microscope. They are {{fusiform}} (tapered at each end), sized 8–10.5 by 3–4.5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells of the}} hymenium) are four-spored.|$|E
5|$|With {{the rise}} of Afrikaner {{nationalism}} in South Africa during {{the early part of}} the 20th century, Scouting was <b>viewed</b> <b>with</b> suspicion by many Afrikaners because of its English roots, and rival Afrikaans organisations including the Voortrekkers were established. These had a strong social and political aim. Negotiations about an amalgamation of both movements in the years 1930 to 1936 were not successful.|$|E
5|$|Al-Qaeda under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's {{leadership}} launched coordinated {{explosions in}} three hotel lobbies in Amman on 9 November 2005, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured.

The attack {{is considered to}} be a rare event in the country, and Jordan's internal security was dramatically improved afterwards. No major terrorist attacks have occurred since then.

30|$|Four {{conditions}} {{that had been}} used in a previous study (Nasar et al. 1983) were considered as a priori conditions: (1) an open <b>view</b> <b>with</b> an unprotected observation point; (2) a closed <b>view</b> <b>with</b> an unprotected observation point; (3) an open <b>view</b> <b>with</b> a protected observation point; and (4) a closed <b>view</b> <b>with</b> a protected observation point. Additionally, all of the sites were selected to have a view of water elements (ponds) in the garden since it is known that water elements profoundly influence the visitors’ affective appraisals and are preferred to other landscape elements (Kaplan and Kaplan 1989; Kaplan et al. 1998).|$|R
5|$|Archer's visit precipitated {{a crisis}} in the colonial administration. It was felt he had been far too {{friendly}} to Abd al-Rahman, who was <b>viewed</b> <b>with</b> suspicion by many administrators. Archer was forced to resign, replaced by Sir John Maffey. Abd al-Rahman was placed under restriction on travel outside Omdurman and Khartoum and was told to instruct his supporters to halt their political and religious activities.|$|E
5|$|Collected in deposit, {{the spores}} of B. mirabilis are olive-brown. <b>Viewed</b> <b>with</b> a microscope, the spores are {{spindle-shaped}} to roughly elliptical, with smooth, thick walls, and have dimensions of 18–22 by 7–9µm. Overholts' 1940 publication on the species reported spore dimensions of 20–26 by 8–9µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, hyaline (translucent), 4-spored, and have dimensions of 31–36 by 7–11µm. Cystidia (sterile cells {{on the face}} of a gill) are thin-walled, and measure 60–90 by 10–18µm. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Cruise's casting caused {{controversy}} among German {{politicians and}} members of the von Stauffenberg family due to the actor's practice of Scientology, which is <b>viewed</b> <b>with</b> suspicion in Germany. Because of this, the filmmakers initially had difficulty setting up filming locations in Germany, but they were later given access to film in locations, including Berlin's historic Bendlerblock. German newspapers and filmmakers supported the film and its attempt to spread global awareness of von Stauffenberg's plot.|$|E

5|$|Eastern-Rite Catholicism was <b>viewed</b> <b>with</b> {{suspicion}} {{by several}} Latin-Rite bishops in the United States; some, such as Archbishop John Ireland of Saint Paul, Minnesota, were actually hostile, especially concerning {{the matter of}} married clergy. In 1891, Alexis Toth brought a group of 361 Eastern Catholics into Orthodoxy. From then {{until his death in}} 1909, Toth brought approximately 20,000 Eastern Catholics from 65 independent communities to Orthodoxy. By 1917, 163 Eastern-Rite Catholic parishes consisting of more than 100,000 faithful had been converted. For his efforts, Toth was glorified as a saint by the OCA in 1994.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are purple-brown to brown. <b>Viewed</b> <b>with</b> a microscopic, the spores appear purple, angular with lobes, and warted, with fine spines {{measuring}} 0.5–1.5µm long; the overall {{dimensions of the}} elliptic spores are 8–12 by 7–9µm. They contain one or two oil drops. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 70–100 by 9–12µm, and have sterigmata that are 2–4µm thick by 7–12µm long. The flesh stains deep blue when a drop of potassium hydroxide solution is applied. The fungus contains the pigment thelephoric acid.|$|E
5|$|Many bathhouses {{are open}} {{twenty-four hours a}} day, seven days a week. There is {{typically}} a single customer entrance and exit. After paying at the main entrance, the customer is buzzed through the main door. This system allows establishments to screen potential troublemakers; many bathhouses refuse entry {{to those who are}} visibly intoxicated, as well as known prostitutes. In some areas, particularly where homosexuality is illegal, considered immoral, or <b>viewed</b> <b>with</b> hostility, this is a necessary safety precaution.|$|E

5|$|Spores are thin-walled, smooth, and {{ellipsoidal}} or oval in shape. <b>Viewed</b> <b>with</b> a microscope, {{they appear}} translucent (hyaline), and stain red or blue with Melzer's reagent (in amyloid). Their dimensions are typically 7–10 by 5–7µm; the spores contain a single large oil droplet. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped, two- to four-spored, and 25–30 by 5–7µm. The presence of sterile cells called pleurocystidia (large cells {{found on the}} gill face in some mushrooms) is uncommon; specimens may contain few or abundant cheilocystidia (large sterile cells found on the gill edge) that are club-shaped, thin-walled and 39–87.5 by 8.5–16µm in size.|$|E
5|$|The ascospores {{produced}} by Polytolypa are , yellow to yellow-orange in color, with dimensions of 2.5–5 by 3–4μm. <b>Viewed</b> <b>with</b> a light microscope their surfaces {{appear to be}} smooth, but under scanning electron microscopy, they are revealed to be densely marked with punctures and small, hard, sharp projections. The structures that produce the ascospores are called asci. In Polytolypa they are numerous, spherical, and measure 9–10 by 12–13μm. Each ascus contains eight ascospores, which are released when the ascus dissolves away at maturity. The anamorph (asexual form of the fungus) resembles the genus Chrysosporium.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{reforming}} the Commonwealth gained traction from the mid-17th century; it was however <b>viewed</b> <b>with</b> suspicion {{not only by}} its magnates but also by neighboring countries, which had been content with {{the deterioration of the}} Commonwealth and abhorred the thought of a resurgent and democratic power on their borders. With the Commonwealth Army reduced to around 16,000, it was easy for its neighbors to intervene directly (The Imperial Russian Army numbered 300,000 troops overall; The Prussian Army and Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire, 200,000 each).|$|E
