5|$|The tufted tit-tyrant is a generalist feeder that eats insects. It is {{also known}} to eat seeds in rare circumstances. It is an active forager that hunts in pairs or, after the {{breeding}} season, small family groups. It has also been known to feed with mixed-species foraging flocks, although this behavior is abnormal. When this does occur, it is most frequently seen foraging with the thorn-tailed rayadito; flocks of thirty tufted tit-tyrants in these mixed-species foraging groups have been reported. Birds in pairs tend to feed leapfrog style and maintain constant <b>visual</b> <b>contact</b> with each other. This species feeds at all strata of its habitat from the understory to the canopy.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} {{distinct}} call types made by Sunda slow loris adults, {{which can be}} divided into two categories: contact and contact-seeking calls such as whistles and short keckers (a social play and attention-seeking call), and aggressive and defensive calls such as long keckers, screams, snarls and grunts. Because they rely on crypsis to avoid predators, they do not make alarm calls. Infants emits clicks and squeaks when disturbed. During estrus, females make whistle calls when in <b>visual</b> <b>contact</b> with a male. When exploring new environments and during handling, it makes ultrasonic vocalisations out of the human hearing range.|$|E
5|$|A precise search {{area was}} {{difficult}} to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably. An important variable was {{the length of time}} he remained in free fall before pulling his rip cord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all. Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected. The T-33 pilots never made <b>visual</b> <b>contact</b> with the 727 at all.|$|E

5|$|In early 1968, the Soviet Ministry of Defence {{decided to}} develop a {{specialised}} shturmovik armoured assault aircraft {{in order to provide}} close air support for the Soviet Ground Forces. The idea of creating a ground-support aircraft came about after analysing the experience of ground-attack (shturmovaya) aviation during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The Soviet fighter-bombers in service or under development at the time (Su-7, Su-17, MiG-21 and MiG-23) did not meet the requirements for close air support of the army. They lacked essential armour plating to protect the pilot and vital equipment from ground fire and missile hits, and their high flight speeds made it difficult for the pilot to maintain <b>visual</b> <b>contact</b> with a target. Having taken into account these problems, Pavel Sukhoi and a group of leading specialists in the Sukhoi Design Bureau started preliminary design work in a comparatively short period of time, with the assistance of leading institutes of the Ministry of the Aviation Industry and the Ministry of Defence.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Portia have hunting tactics as {{versatile}} and adaptable as a lion's. All members of Portia have instinctive tactics for their most common prey, but can improvise {{by trial and error}} against unfamiliar prey or in unfamiliar situations, and then remember the new approach. They can also make detours to find the best attack angle against dangerous prey, even when the best detour takes a Portia out of <b>visual</b> <b>contact</b> with the prey, and sometimes the planned route leads to abseiling down a silk thread and biting the prey from behind. Such detours may take up to an hour, and a Portia usually picks the best route even if it needs to walk past an incorrect route. If a Portia makes a mistake while hunting another spider, it may itself be killed.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 31 May Howe's fleet {{closed with}} the French, making {{full use of}} the {{advantage}} of the weather gage. By 17:00 the fleets were five miles (9km) apart, but at 19:00 Howe gave orders to keep his ships out of shot range but within easy sailing of the French. He did not want a repeat of the confusion of 29 May and preferred to delay any combat until he was assured of a full day in which to conduct it, in order that his signals not be obscured or misinterpreted. During the night the fleets remained in <b>visual</b> <b>contact,</b> and by first light on 1 June the British were just six miles (11km) from Villaret's fleet and organising in preparation to attack once more. Both fleets were now sailing in a western direction, Villaret still hoping to draw Howe away from the convoy.|$|E

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the reports given in the original classified teleprinter message and in the accounts of both Wimbledon and Perkins, the aircrews both stated that the radar contacts obtained were unimpressive and that no 'tail-chase', or action {{on the part of}} the target, occurred.

The first pilot, Chambers, commented that [...] "my feeling is that there was nothing there, it was some sort of mistake", while Ivan Logan, the second Venom's navigator, stated that [...] "all we saw was a blip which rather indicated a stationary target". At the time 23 Squadron decided that the radar contact had, if anything, been with a weather balloon.|$|R

40|$|Animals {{exploiting}} their familiar {{food items}} often avoid spatio-temporal aggregation with others by avoiding scents, less rewarding areas or <b>visual</b> <b>contacts,</b> thereby minimizing competition or interference when resources are replenished slowly in patches. When animals are searching or assessing available food sources, however, they {{may benefit from}} reducing sampling costs by following others at food sites. Therefore, animals may adjust their responses to others depending on their familiarity with foraging situations. Here, we conducted field experiments to test whether nectar-collecting bumble bees make this adjustment. We allowed free-foraging bees to choose between two inflorescences, one occupied by a conspecific bee and another unoccupied. When bees were presented with flowers of a familiar type, they avoided occupied inflorescences. In contrast, bees visited an occupied inflorescence when the flower type was unfamiliar. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report suggesting that animals adjust their responses to feeding conspecifics depending on their familiarity with food sources. Such behavioural flexibilities should allow foragers to both explore and exploit their environments efficiently...|$|R

40|$|Communication in a {{congress}} {{is often the}} first opportunity to present a study’s results. The exercise is difficult and {{the interest of the}} audience for what we have to say is far from being guaranteed. The objective {{of this article is to}} present a few principles of scientific oral communication. A good oral communication starts with an abstract presenting a clear question, correct methods and interesting results. Once the abstract is accepted, one needs to Target a Single and Absolute Objective of Communication (TSAOC), i. e. to choose what the public must remember (the most significant result and its major implication for the public), and prepare the presentation according to the TSAOC. We must plan one audio-visual support per minute of time allotted, and define the length and key elements of each section according to the familiarity of the audience with the issue discussed. The choice and development of audio-visual supports must guarantee an easy reading, wherever the listener is. Several rehearsals are necessary to check that the TSAOC is met and the allotted time respected. The control of conditions of communication covers familiarisation with the location of presentation (checking of the room, checking of the audio-visual material, meeting with the moderator), and the presentation itself (polite greeting, fast introduction of the subject, <b>visual</b> <b>contacts</b> with the public, moderater pointing, acceptance of anxiety as a natural phenomenon). Application of these principles guarantees the efficient transmission of results of studies to those who can use them...|$|R
