25|$|The {{main feature}} of modern non-solid (wet) {{tantalum}} electrolytic capacitors are their energy density {{compared with that}} of solid tantalum and wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors within the same temperature range. Due to their self-healing properties (the non-solid electrolyte can deliver oxygen to form new oxide layer in weak areas of the dielectric), the dielectric thickness can be formed with much lower safety margins and consequently with much thinner dielectric than for solid types, resulting in a higher CV value per <b>volume</b> <b>unit.</b> Additionally, wet tantalum capacitors are able to operate at voltages in excess of 100V up to 630V, have a relatively low ESR, and have the lowest leakage current of all electrolytic capacitors.|$|E

The sample of this study was the students of 8 th grade from any primary school in Eskisehir-Turkey. After the evaluation of this data, it was observed that the usage-proficiency of length, area, <b>volume</b> <b>units</b> was changed according to gender. It was found that there is a positive relation among the usage-proficiency of units and attitude toward science, academical successes for mathematics, and science...|$|R

5000|$|While the {{dimensions}} of the individual channels are small, a microprocess engineering device ("microstructured reactor") can contain manythousands of such channels, and the overall size of a microstructuredreactor can be on the scale of meters. The objective of micro processengineering is not primarily to miniaturize production plants,but to increase yields and selectivities of chemical reactions, thusreducing the cost of chemical production. This goal can be achieved byeither using chemical reactions that cannot be conducted in largervolumina, or by running chemical reactions at parameters (temperatures,pressures, concentrations) that are inaccessible in larger volumina dueto safety constraints.
