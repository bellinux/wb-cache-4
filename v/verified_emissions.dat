40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} how the publication of <b>verified</b> <b>emissions</b> in the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) affected stock prices of covered companies. Based on a unique sample of 368 listed companies located in 25 countries, the event study demonstrates that 2 out of 6 publication events over the period 2006 - 2011 resulted in statistically significant market responses. The two significant events were the first publication of <b>verified</b> <b>emissions</b> in the first phase, a pilot period that ran from 2005 to 2007, and the first publication in the second phase, coinciding with the Kyoto Protocol commitment period and comprising the years 2008 to 2012. These findings indicate that investors value particularly the information revealed at the first verification event of each EU ETS phase and that subsequent verification events are less informative. The cross-section analysis of abnormal returns surrounding the publication of verified emission does not yield consistent results. While {{the analysis of the}} first publication in the first phase provides insignificant results, we find a significant negative correlation between the market reaction and the level of unexpected <b>verified</b> <b>emissions</b> during the first publication in the second phase. This negative relationship is found to be significantly stronger for carbon-intensive firms. These different results suggest that investors’ perception towards emission allowances has changed {{between the first and second}} phase.

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) the European Union set a milestone in the use of innovative economic instruments. In 2003 the "Directive 2003 / 87 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96 / 61 /EC ” was adopted, which defines the benchmarks and criteria used to operate the emission trading system and identifies the framework governing national legislation. The EU ETS started in January 2005. Thus, since the beginning of 2005 the European Union regulates CO 2 emissions from heavy industries in the framework of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The system is limited to four industrial sectors (Energy activities, Production and processing of ferrous metals, Mineral industry, Other activities) and follows a cap and trade approach where allowances are allocated for free to installations based on their historic emissions. The Member States, which have to provide National Allocation Plans, are responsible for allocating emission allowances to sectors and installations. The EU provided guidelines for the allocation process, but leaves details on the allocation plans with Member States. National Allocation Plans, nevertheless, have to be approved by the European Commission.

40|$|As {{one of the}} {{offsetting}} instruments, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) allows industrialized countries to meet their compliance objectives by undertaking and financing project activities in developing countries with certified emissions reductions (CERs) in return.

Emissions offsets in this latter category are verified by official or independent agents but are not certified by regulatory authorities {{for use as a}} compliance instrument, and are commonly referred to as <b>verified</b> <b>emissions</b> reductions (VERs) which are not a standardized commodity.

40|$|This paper {{exploits}} {{a little}} used data resource within the central registry of the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) to analyze cross border flows of allowances for compliance purposes {{during the first}} trading period (2005 - 2007). The extent of cross border trading is small in the aggregate but remarkably frequent in matching allowance deficits and surpluses at the installation level throughout the EU. As such, these data provide evidence of the high and widespread market participation that is the precondition of efficient abatement in a capand-trade system. There is also remarkable little difference in the monetization of allowance surpluses between participants in the EU 15 {{and those in the}} East European New Member States.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an empirical-based {{study of the}} European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and its {{implications}} in terms of corporate environmental and financial performance. The novelty of this study includes the extended scope of the data coverage, as most previous studies have examined only the power sector. The use of <b>verified</b> <b>emissions</b> data of ETS-regulated firms as the environmental compliance measure and as the potential differentiating criteria that concern the valuation of EU ETS-exposed firms {{in the stock market}} is also an original aspect of this study. The study begins in Chapter 2 by introducing the background information on the emission trading system (ETS), which focuses on (i) the adoption of ETS as an environmental management instrument and (ii) the adoption of ETS by the European Union as one of its central climate policies. Chapter 3 surveys four databases that provide carbon emissions data {{in order to determine the}} most suitable source of the data to be used in the later empirical chapters. The first empirical chapter, which is also Chapter 4 of this thesis, investigates the determinants of the emissions compliance performance of the EU ETS-exposed firms through constructing the best possible performance ratio from <b>verified</b> <b>emissions</b> data and self-configuring models for a panel regression analysis. Chapter 5 examines the impacts on the EU ETS-exposed firms in terms of their equity valuation with customised portfolios and multi-factor market models. The research design takes into account the emissions allowance (EUA) price as an additional factor, as it has the most direct association with the EU ETS to control for the exposure. The final empirical Chapter 6 takes the investigation one step further, by specifically testing the degree of ETS exposure facing different sectors with sector-based portfolios and an extended multi-factor market model. The findings from the emissions performance ratio analysis show that the business model of firms significantly influences emissions compliance, as the capital intensity has a positive association with the increasing emissions-to-emissions cap ratio. Furthermore, different sectors show different degrees of sensitivity towards the determining factors. The production factor influences the performance ratio of the Utilities sector, but not the Energy or Materials sectors. The results show that the capital intensity has a more profound influence on the utilities sector than on the materials sector. With regard to the financial performance impact, ETS-exposed firms as aggregate portfolios experienced a substantial underperformance during the 2001 – 2004 period, but not in the operating period of 2005 – 2011. The results of the sector-based portfolios show again the differentiating effect of the EU ETS on sectors, as one sector is priced indifferently against its benchmark, three sectors see a constant underperformance, and three sectors have altered outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Tesis Doctoral leída en la Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid en 2011. Director de la Tesis: Pablo Martínez de AnguitaThe {{destruction}} of forests-principally in the tropics-emits {{massive amounts of}} carbon dioxide. Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) -a prime source of lowcost reductions of greenhouse gas emissions-in tropical forest nations could make a substantial contribution to addressing climate change. To date, large-scale forest protection efforts have been financed primarily by official development assistance, which are in most cases orders of magnitude lower than required. A better way-both {{in terms of economic}} efficiency and political plausibility-is to draw capital flows from the carbon market. Using the market as a source of funds can free billions in financial flows. However there is no place for these tons in existing carbon market policy frameworks. The goal of this dissertation is to shed light on the issues preventing "market-based REDD" from taking off, as well as to illustrate some potential solutions and paths forward. "Market-based REDD" would enable developing nations themselves to earn carbon credits for <b>verified</b> <b>emissions</b> reductions against an agreed national baseline and sell them in existing carbon markets. This would encourage emissions reductions in tropical forest nations while helping to manage the costs of compliance in countries that take on economy-wide caps. However, a prominent concern with market-based REDD has been that emissions reductions from forests will be so abundant as to "flood the carbon market". We use a multi-period partial equilibrium modeling approach {{to assess the impact of}} REDD tons in frameworks with long time horizons. We conclude that the long-term horizon, the progressive tightening of emission caps, and the possibility of banking enable a direct market-based funding mechanism to deliver financing at significant scale and absorb the maximum quantity of REDD credit tons, even in the near-term. Absent an overarching international agreement, a bilateral agreement between the EU and Brazil would make great strides towards halting the {{destruction of}} the Amazon Rainforest. The Brazilian plan to reduce deforestation by 80 % in 2020 sets the stage for a win-win situation for Brazil and the EU. If a portion of Brazils reductions, above a pre-determined reference level, were sold as carbon market credits, the EU would gain by reducing its compliance costs and could potentially increase its emissions reductions at no additional cost over the case without REDD. The EU would just need to create further certainty over future EU climate policy in order to enable greater emissions reductions over the near term for the purpose of banking credits for future use. A Brazilian economy-wide cap-and-trade system has the potential to tap on a broader mitigation potential in a cost-efficient fashion and to bolster the eligibility of REDD credits in the EU by linking the Brazilian cap-and-trade with the EU carbon markets. The Brazilian REDD crediting system could be easily integrated into the Brazilian cap and trade program through a point of regulation at the level of the Brazilian states, which could then establish so-called "nested" programs for crediting reductions within their jurisdiction in order to tap on private funding. Bilaterally linking the proposed climate protection efforts of the EU and Brazil through a future carbon market could not only multiply the effectiveness of each nations program and achieve greater combined climatic benefits, but also generate intangible and countless ancillary benefits associated with the conservation of the Amazon Rainforest.
