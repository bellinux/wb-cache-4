5000|$|A <b>Volume</b> <b>table</b> is a chart {{to aid in}} the {{estimation}} of standing timber volume. These tables are based on volume equations and use correlations between certain aspects of a tree to estimate the volume to a degree of certainty. The diameter at breast height (DBH) and the merchantable height are used to determine the total volume. Difficulties occur when estimating the form class of the tree in question. The Mesavage and Girard form classes used to classify the trees to decide which <b>volume</b> <b>table</b> should be used. These volume tables are also based on different log rules such a Scribner, Doyle, and International ¼” scale. In order to be effective, the proper form class must be selected as well as accurate DBH and height measurements.|$|E

In this note we describe the statistical analyses which were carried out and we discuss results and their potential application. The use of stand <b>volume</b> <b>tables</b> is suggested mainly when it is possible to adopt quick, effective procedures for the assessment of the unitary basal area: in particular, the major potential is for surveys based upon relascope estimation of basal area in correspondence of sample points positioned according to probabilistic sampling scheme...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} Pf {{forest resources}} {{is a complex}} task. A thorough and up-to-date inventory {{is an important part}} of forest management. Aerial photography is one of the import-ant tools used to facilitate the design of a forest inventory. Aerial photographs are used to determine acreages, to locate roads and sample plots, and to stratify the forest area if a stratified sampling design is to be used. Aerial photo-graphs can further be utilized in conjunction with aerial photo <b>volume</b> <b>tables</b> to conduct a combined photo-field cruise, thus reducing costs. However, aerial photo cruising is sometimes limited in practice, because insufficient aerial photo <b>volume</b> <b>tables</b> are available for specific species and for different geographic areas of the country. In this study six stand aerial photo <b>volume</b> <b>tables</b> were tested to determine their reliability to predict volume for three different timber types (even-aged Douglas-fir, even-aged ponderosa pine and all-aged ponderosa pine). These six tables represented four different species groups (Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, hardwoods and mixed conifers) arid four different geographic locations (Western Oregon an...|$|R

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of VSAM, OS/360 systems implemented an unusual hybrid file system. The system was designed to easily support removable disk packs, so the information relating to all files on one disk (volume in IBM terminology) is stored on that disk in a flat system file called the <b>Volume</b> <b>Table</b> of Contents (VTOC). The VTOC stores all metadata for the file. Later a hierarchical directory structure was imposed with {{the introduction}} of the System Catalog, which can optionally catalog files (datasets) on resident and removable volumes. The catalog only contains information to relate a dataset to a specific volume. If the user requests access to a dataset on an offline volume, and he has suitable privileges, the system will attempt to mount the required volume. Cataloged and non-cataloged datasets can still be accessed using information in the VTOC, bypassing the catalog, if the required volume id is provided to the OPEN request. Still later the VTOC was indexed to speed up access.|$|E

50|$|In the IBM {{mainframe}} storage architecture, <b>Volume</b> <b>Table</b> of Contents, or VTOC, is a {{data structure}} {{that provides a}} way of locating the data sets that reside on a particular disk volume. It is the functional equivalent of both the master boot record or GUID Partition Table on a desktop PC, and the root directory of a mass storage device (floppy, jump drive, hard disk, etc.) on a PC or minicomputer, e.g. / on Unix or Linux, C:\ on MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows. It lists the names of each data set on the volume as well as size, location, and permissions. Additionally, it contains an entry for every area of contiguous free space on the volume. The third record on the first track of the first cylinder of any volume of DASD (i.e. disk pack) {{is known as the}} volume label and must contain a pointer to the location of the VTOC. A VTOC is added to a disk when it is initialized using the Device Support Facilities utility program, ICKDSF. VTOC was originally designed for removable disk packs.|$|E
50|$|When {{floppy disk}} media was first {{available}} {{this type of}} file system was adequate due to the relatively small amount of data space available. CP/M machines featured a flat file system, where files could be {{assigned to one of}} 16 user areas and generic file operations narrowed to work on one instead of defaulting to work on all of them. These user areas were no more than special attributes associated with the files, that is, it was not necessary to define specific quota for each of these areas and files could be added to groups for as long as there was still free storage space on the disk. The early Apple Macintosh also featured a flat file system, the Macintosh File System. It was unusual in that the file management program (Macintosh Finder) created the illusion of a partially hierarchical filing system on top of EMFS. This structure required every file to have a unique name, even if it appeared to be in a separate folder. IBM DOS/360 and OS/360 store entries for all files on a disk pack (volume) in a directory on the pack called a <b>Volume</b> <b>Table</b> of Contents (VTOC).|$|E

40|$|<b>Volume</b> <b>tables</b> {{have been}} {{constructed}} for European larch (Larix decidua Mill.), Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi (Lamb.)

The application of the proposed tables is only for trees whose diameters (d. b. h.) are less than 22 cm over bark at 1. 3 m above ground level. They are particularly useful for estimating total tree volume of trees (excluding branches) of early thinnings and volume increment of small-sized trees in genetic improvement experiments.

A two-variable <b>volume</b> <b>table</b> which is expressed as {{the function of the}} basal area was adopted. The hardwoods were classified into two, the evergreen- and the deciduous-hardwoods, and on testing the significant difference between their volumes, it is recognized that the stem volumes do not show any significant difference but the other two show significant differences. Therefore, the evergreen-hardwood <b>volume</b> <b>table</b> can be separated from the deciduous-hardwood <b>volume</b> <b>table.</b> Comparing this <b>volume</b> <b>table</b> with the Kumamoto Regional Forestry Office 2 ̆ 7 s <b>volume</b> <b>table,</b> significant difference is recognized between the two. Therefore, when research is made into the volume of the underwood (hardwood) of the middle forest system, the Kumamoto Regional Office 2 ̆ 7 s <b>volume</b> <b>table</b> should not be used. The relation of the branch percentage to d. b. h. is shown as a hyperbola. This curve shows bad fitness for 10 cm d. b. h. and over, but good fitness for 8 cm d. b. h. and under.

40|$|Laser {{scanning}} is a recently-introduced {{remote sensing}} technology that shows high potentiality {{in the context}} of the forestry resources management. The research group of the University of Udine, within an INTERREG IIIA Phare/CBC Italy-Slovenia project, developed specific methods regarding the use of LiDAR data for forestry applications. A specific methodology which makes possible to obtain the position of the single trees and their relative heights has been implemented. On the basis of the height distributions, using stand height curves relation already available in the stand <b>volume</b> <b>tables,</b> a method to derive the volume values of each tree is proposed. The paper shows the first results obtained with the above method in terms of diameter and volume estimation on the basis of laser scanning data surveyed in different composed forestry plots. A comparison between laser-based and traditional methods-based data is also presented. Some of the consequences of this different way to use the stand <b>volume</b> <b>tables</b> were analyzed, and an experimental procedure is proposed that seems to guarantee a sufficient reliability of the results, and their historical continuity. Furthermore, the approach described may reduce the costs of the traditional dendrometric assessment, nowadays not sustainable in forest management...|$|R
