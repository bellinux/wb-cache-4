40|$|LecturePg. 59 - 66 In the past, large {{compressors}} in the {{petrochemical industry}} were mostly driven {{in one of}} two ways: by steam (or gas) turbines or by constant speed electrical motors. If the flow of the compressor had to be controlled, two ways were possible: to control its speed or to control its suction. If flow control was required, the steam (or gas) turbine was the right answer, since in-plant steam could be produced at a rather low cost (gas could be purchased for an equally low price). In the case of more continuous, even flow rates, the constant speed electric motor was a good alternative. For startup, the compressor was bypassed and, if a certain control was necessary, suction control was used without even looking at the power consumption. Highly increased fuel cost, especially for in-plant steam generation, has made commercially available electric power from large generating plants more attractive. On the other hand, for the same reason, energy conservation makes speed control much superior to suction control and last, but not least, the more diversified nature of feed stocks as well as more fluctuating production rates call more often for compressors to be controlled. The same is valid for other centrifugal machines such as boiler feed water pumps and pipeline loading pumps. Today, more and more compressors are driven by <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>devices</b> other than steam turbines. One way is to use purely electric drives, which are, however, still in the trial phase regarding large horsepower. Another, much more proven way is to use, in connection with a standard constant speed electric motor, a hydrodynamic, so-called, fluid coupling. The type of fluid coupling mostly used for this application is the one with integrated gears. This kind of machine, relatively new to the petrochemical community, has, however, proven its high reliability and availability in thousands of applications in the power generating industry, mostly with boiler feed pumps. Other applications have included installations in oil producing and shipping plants, on platforms offshore and onshore, and with pipeline and loading pumps. Successful compressor applications go back some 15 years, with numbers increasing over the last three to four years. These compressor applications go up to 10, 000 hp, with output speeds reaching 12, 000 rpm. Pump applications with many more years of case history exist up to 30, 000 hp, with designs available for 60, 000 hp. There are many more applications of the hydrodynamic principle in numerous other industries, in the form of fluid couplings and torque converters, as well as combined transmissions.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Energy Institute, 2012 Artan dünya nüfusu teknolojinin gelişimi ve sanayileşme yarışı, enerjiye olan bağımlılığı sürekli olarak artırmaktadır. Enerjiye olan talebin gün geçtikçe artması, enerji yatırımlarının yüksek maliyetleri ve yeni yatırımların ihtiyacı karşılayamaması sebeplerinden ötürü, mevcut sistemlerin iyileştirilmesi ile ilgili çalışmalar önem kazanmıştır. Özellikle devlet tarafından enerji verimliliği konusunda yapılan düzenlemeler, teşvik ve yasal zorunluluklar enerji verimliliği çalışmalarının artmasına yol açmaktadır. Enerji Verimliliği Kanunu, Binalarda Enerji Performans Yönetmeliği, Enerji Kaynakları ve Enerjinin Kullanımında Verimliliğin Artırılmasına Dair Yönetmelik ve Yenilenebilir Enerji Kanunu bu yasal düzenlemelere örnek verilebilir.

Energy {{is one of}} the {{significant}} inputs of economic and social development. In this aspect, energy plays an important role for the rasing of the living standards of a society. Sustainable development is possible through energy as well. As known, it appears that upper limits are approached in pump efficiencies and the potential improvements could not be more than a few points. The energy saved through efficiency improvements of pumping systems is related with proper selection, using of pump and the improvement of system design. The dependence on energy is increasing consistently due to the growing world population, development of new technologies and industrialization race. During the past several decades, studies for improving of existing systems has been a popular issue, regarding to increasing demand on energy, high cost and insufficiency of new energy investments. During the past several decades, environmental consciousness of the population has increased dramatically and mankind started to question his effects on the environment. In connection this issues, not just the society but also the customers started to question the environmental effects of the products they use. Increasingly every year, consumers demand low carbon foot print products, which lead manufacturers to produce items that does not harm the environment. As a result energy efficiency on circulation pumps starts to become obsolete and a new research and development processes has been developed. Today energy efficiency {{is one of the}} most important subjects for circulation pumps. High efficient pumps are started to use because of both legal regulations. In particular, the regulations made by the government about energy efficiency, such as incentives and legal obligations, led to increase energy efficiency efforts. Energy Efficiency Law, The Energy Performance of Buildings Regulation, Increasing Efficiency Regulation on Using Energy and Energy Resources and Renewable Energy Law are the examples of these efforts. All these regulations and increasing energy prices have the companies to come up new energy efficiency efforts. <b>Variable</b> <b>speed</b> drive systems have become a popular and widely used application on account of their energy saving features and simple usage in the market. Energy consumption and overall life cycle costs of equipment are reduced significantly, permitting operators to run the same production with much less energy. This becomes all the more topical in view of high energy prices and the unacceptability of the energy related emissions on the one hand, and the industrial requirements of fast growing economies. Pumping applications represent a significant opportunity for applying <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> drives in new, as well as retrofit installations. The majority of pumping applications need to be controlled. It is unlikely that a pump will run continuously at a maximum <b>speed.</b> <b>Variable</b> <b>speed</b> drives are crucial when limiting the life cycle costs of a pump station. The three main costs are energy, initial investment an maintenance. Many analyses show that energy consumption is the dominating element of the life cycle costs. The investment cost of the equipment needed (<b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> drives, motors and pumps) is relatively low when compared to the total life cycle costs. Maintenance is the third main cost component. Active control using a <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> drive works as a means of preventive maintenancei limiting maintenance costs in many ways. <b>Variable</b> <b>speed</b> control has several benefits in pumping applications. The most important is energy saving. Accurate control of the pump system is another benefit. The use of <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> drives in pumping applications with variable duty requirements provides the user with a variety of benefits, including potentially significant energy saving and improved reliability achieved by means of speed reduction and avoding part flow operation. Energy savings are primarily realized by running the equipment at high levels of efficiency and optimal operating speeds, matching the generated pump head to the exact system requirements without the use of energy consuming control valves. Running pumps at lower operating speeds and avoiding part flow operation also positively influences component life and between maintenance intervals. The primary mechanical challenge of any <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> drive application is the wide continuous operating speed range. During the past 10 years, the cost os <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>devices</b> have come down significantly due to the advances in technology, which allowed widespread applications of <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> pumps. An increased issue associated with the use of <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> pumps is to control and optimization of their operation. As a result, in terms of enhancing the operating efficiency, energy efficient control of the <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> pumps becomes an important issue. In today?s business environment, heating and cooling systems are looking for new strategies to enchase plant performance. An easy and often overlooked means to make a dramatic impact on these systems? performances is through maximazing pumping system efficiency. The assesment of technical and economical advantages gained by using <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> drives instead of throttling valves on circulation pumps, have been widely publicized in recent years. Circulation pumps are responsible for the circulation of hot and cold water in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. Older non controlled circulation pumps can be one of the most energy consuming electric devices in private household and commercial buildings. In this thesis, within the framework of the legislation and regulations, <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> circulation pumps are investigated for better energy efficiency. The parallel running <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> circulation pumps in closed loop systems are also investigated for better energy and system efficiency. Especially, this study is based on parallel running <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> circulation pumps. Parallel running of the circulation pumps is an important issue and it should be investigated carefully for energy efficient working. Under the same hydraulic conditions, for the same type of parallel running <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> circulation pumps, with the same speed ratio, the best overall energy efficiency is sought. System control algorithm which developed for the circulating pumps is also an important issue for evaluating energy efficiency. Pressure control algorithm is based on two methods such as constant and variable differential control. In this study, constant differential pressure algoritm was used during the experiments. Besides, in literature, it is known that variable differential pressure algorithm saves more energy. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R

The addition of renewable power to save fuel reduces engine load even further. This low load operation results in poor fuel efficiency and increased maintenance due to engine fouling, especially in cold ambient conditions. <b>Variable</b> <b>speed</b> operation of these diesel generator sets has been studied, in general, {{and as a}} solution to efficiency and fouling problems. <b>Variable</b> <b>speed</b> operation requires the addition of a supervisory controller and an electronic power converter to provide constant frequency power. ^ Conclusions are based on testing of diesel generators and thermodynamic and dynamic modeling. Tests included steady state tests of two diesel generators (5 kW and 15 kW systems) and tests of a prototype 5 kW <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> system. Heat release, combustion duration, and cylinder gas temperatures were derived from cylinder pressure data. System component design and the effects of component limitations on <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> operation are discussed. Once a <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> operating strategy is determined for a sample 15 kW system, test data are used to determine fuel savings and to estimate the potential for improvements in emissions, cold weather fouling, and engine wear. ^ Results show that <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> systems are most applicable where the peak power system capability is large compared to the average load. In existing, isolated power systems fuel savings could be as high as 40 % of annual fuel. A comparison of combustion conditions between constant <b>speed</b> and <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> operation of diesel generator sets shows that unburned hydrocarbon emissions from local overleaning, wall quenching, and bulk quenching of combustion should be reduced with <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> operation. Likewise, particulate emissions and low load, cold weather engine fouling should be reduced. The effects on other sources of unburned hydrocarbon emissions and on NOx emissions are ambiguous.

The analysis also discusses factors affecting <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> operation of diesel generator sets larger than those tested in this study. ...|$|R
30|$|The two {{calibrated}} crash prediction models {{described in}} the previous section were used to estimate the safety impacts of a candidate <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> limit control strategy. The focus on this application is the degree of consistency of the safety impacts obtained from the two calibrated safety models rather than on the <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> limit sign system itself. This is not to investigate which model has a better fit, rather to evaluate sensitivity of model calibration on the final safety benefits of a candidate <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> limit system.|$|R

40|$|Simply put, a <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> {{drive is}} a {{controller}} {{that allows a}} motor and its associated equipment to run at different speeds depending upon automated input from an industrial process. That in turn provides the ability to provide smoother operations, and most importantly, energy savings by slowing down machinery when a process {{does not have to}} run at full speed. Long a leading book on this technology, this new edition by industry authority David William Spitzer provides insights to improving the applications of <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> drives. Whether you have basic knowledge or advanced knowledge, you will find this book to be an extremely useful introduction to how <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> drivers work, how they are best applied, and what to do and what to avoid when employing them as part of an overall automated industrial enterprise, all with an eye on energy savings. Inside, you will find: A basic overview of electrical, hydraulic, and instrumentation principles of <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> drives. Coverage of the role that <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> drives can play in overall plant energy requirements and energy savings. Coverage of developments in variable frequency drives. Coverage of new manufacturing applications for <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> drives. Examples of real-world applications that help make the theory and knowledge more clear and understandable...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on I 2 C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) {{protocol}} interface between Master Bus protocol and slave. Here we are interfacing between micro-controller and DS 1307. I 2 C bus protocol sends 8 bit data from micro-controller to DS 1307. This module was designed in VHDL and simulated and synthesized using Xilinx ISE Design Suite 14. 2. I 2 C and optimized for area and power. This concept is widely applicable from any high <b>speed</b> <b>device</b> or low <b>speed</b> <b>device</b> to any low <b>speed</b> <b>device</b> or high <b>speed</b> <b>device.</b> This module acts as a slave for the DS 1307 at the same time acts like a master for the micro-controller device which can be considered as a slave.. It can be used to interface low speed peripherals like motherboard, embedded system, mobile phones, set top boxes, DVD, PDA’s or other electronic devices...|$|R
