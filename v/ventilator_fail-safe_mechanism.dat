Such {{operating systems}} need a <b>fail-safe</b> <b>mechanism</b> for protecting the systems from erroneous extension modules. However, the mechanism with the full capability of the protection has implied serious performance penalties. To address this problem, we propose a new <b>fail-safe</b> <b>mechanism</b> called multi-level protection.

For example, they can choose a higher level for an unstable module, but a lower one for a stable module.

40|$|A {{design for}} the <b>fail-safe</b> <b>mechanism</b> of a guide vane in a Francis-type hydro turbine is {{proposed}} and analyzed. The mechanism {{that is based on}} a shear pin as a sacrificial component was designed to remain simple. Unlike the requirements of conventional designs, a shear pin must be able to withstand static and dynamic loads but must fail under a certain overload that could damage a guide vane. An accurate load determination and selection of the shear pin material were demonstrated. The static load for various opening angles of the guide vane were calculated using the computational fluid dynamics Fluent and finite element method Ansys programs. Furthermore, simulations for overload and dynamic load due to the waterhammer phenomenon were also conducted. The results of load calculations were used to select an appropriate shear pin material. Quasi-static shear tests were performed for two shear pins of aluminum alloy Al 2024 subjected to different aging treatments (i. e. artificial and natural aging).

5000|$|However, this {{conclusion}} raised another {{question as to}} how Saulin {{managed to get the}} train moving again. A <b>fail-safe</b> <b>mechanism</b> on the cars locks the brakes in the on position if the valve is closed. The only way to start the train again is to re-open the valve or manually unlock each brake pad. SNCF policy requires to call for an engineer to examine the train (who would have probably found the closed valve). However, Saulin, anxious to continue the trip, enlisted the help of Boveé to work along opposite sides of the train unlocking each brake. Saulin believed the cause of the problem to be a common condition known as an [...] "air lock". When the emergency brake is activated, an [...] "air lock" [...] {{is the result of the}} compressed air filling up the brake pipes, clogging them and preventing the brakes from working. The brake pads lock as part of the <b>fail-safe</b> <b>mechanism</b> when an air lock occurs. To fix this problem, the trapped air must be bled out of the pipe to release the brakes. Nevertheless, Saulin had no idea of what he had done, and stated that the pressure gauge in his cab was marking the correct measure, which is why he thought all the braking systems were in working order. Unbeknownst to him, he had closed the main valve, isolating the front carriage from the rest of the train. Thus the gauge only showed the pressure of the first carriage's brakes.|$|R

We demonstrate that inactivation of Fbxw 7 in hematopoietic cells causes premature depletion of HSCs due to active cell cycling and p 53 -dependent apoptosis. Interestingly, Fbxw 7 deletion also confers a selective advantage to cells with suppressed p 53 function, eventually leading to development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Thus, Fbxw 7 functions as a <b>fail-safe</b> <b>mechanism</b> against both premature HSC loss and leukemogenesis...|$|R
