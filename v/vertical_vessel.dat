40|$|Abstract — During subsea lifting {{operations}} in harsh sea conditions, the involved crane system {{is subjected to}} extensive dynamic forces due to <b>vertical</b> <b>vessel</b> motion. Thus, active heave compensation systems {{can be used to}} compensate for <b>vertical</b> <b>vessel</b> motion and to reduce forces acting on the crane structure. Furthermore, such systems allow an exact positioning of the load on the seabed. However, active heave compensation systems always require knowledge about the vertical position of the crane depending on the ship’s heave, roll, and pitch motion. Hence, an attitude estimation method for ships during subsea lifting operations is proposed. To estimate the roll and pitch motion of a vessel with high accuracy, rotation rate sensors are fused with accelerometers using an Extended Kalman Filter. Since an exact knowledge of the yaw motion is not required to determine the crane’s vertical motion, the yaw angle is stabilized around zero with an additional virtual sensor signal.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{draining}} of a yield-stress fluid from a <b>vertical</b> <b>vessel</b> having a hole or a tube at its bottom. In {{order to understand}} the basic process we first study the problem with a Newtonian fluid and show that the flow characteristics can be very well described by assuming that the flow is analogous to that through a straight conduit of given length. For a yield-stress fluid draining through a hole the behaviour is different: the flow stops when the pressure drop across the orifice falls to a finite value which increases as the yield stress of the fluid increases or the hole radius R decreases. All the data collapse onto a master curve when plotted in terms of dimensionless numbers involving a characteristic length which is a function of R. We deduce an empirical model for the flow characteristics in such a case. When a length of tube is added after the hole we show that the characteristics of the flow are similar to those for flow through a straight conduit with an equivalent length equal to the tube length plus a fixed additional length...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{adaptive}} multiresolution {{scheme is}} {{proposed for the}} numerical solution of a s-patially two-dimensional model of sedimentation of suspensions of small solid particles dispersed in a viscous fluid. This model consists in {{a version of the}} Stokes equations for incompressible fluid flow coupled with a hyperbolic conservation law for the local solids concentration. We study the process in an inclined, rectangular closed vessel, a configuration that gives rise a well-known increase of settling rates (compared with a <b>vertical</b> <b>vessel)</b> known as the “Boycott effect”. Sharp fronts and discontinuities in the concentration field are typical features of sedimentation phenomena. This solution behavior calls for locally refined meshes to concentrate computational effort on zones of strong variation. The spatial discretization presented herein is naturally based on a finite volume (FV) formulation for the Stokes problem including a pressure stabilization technique, while a Godunov-type scheme endowed with a fully adaptive multiresolution (MR) technique is applied to capture the evolution of the concentration field, which in addition induces an important speed-up of CPU time and savings in memory requirements. Numerical simulations illustrate that the proposed scheme is robust and allows for substantial reductions in computational effort while the computations remain accurate and stable. Key words.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with a common class of problem involving two phase separation of a dispersed gas flow from a continuous liquid flow under extreme processing conditions. Relatively fine spherical bubbles of order 500 µm were generated {{in the presence of}} a surfactant under a high shear rate within a rectangular, multi-channeled, cuboidal downcomer. Liquid fluxes, as high as 176 cm/s through each channel of the downcomer, sheared bubbles from a sintered surface mounted flush to the channel wall before disengaging the downcomer flow into a <b>vertical</b> <b>vessel.</b> Both high feed fluxes, up to 15 cm/s, and high gas fluxes, up to 5. 5 cm/s, ensured a high gas holdup beneath the downcomer and the hindered rising of the bubbles. Enhanced bubble-liquid segregation was achieved using an arrangement of parallel inclined channels incorporated below the main vertical chamber. This novel device, referred to as the Reflux Flotation Cell, prevented the entrainment of bubbles to the underflow, and significantly reduced the liquid flux to overflow, even in the absence of a conventional froth zone. Extreme upward bubble surface fluxes of up to 600 s⁻¹ were achieved, while counter-current downward liquid fluxes reached 14. 4 cm/s, arguably four times the bubble terminal rise velocity. Hence successful phase separation was achieved while operating well beyond the so-called flooding condition arising from extreme levels of gas and feed fluxes. This hydrodynamic arrangement should find application in increasing surfactant extraction rates in foam fractionation and ion flotation, gas absorption, and even particulate flotation...|$|E
40|$|Gas-lift {{reactors}} are {{the simplest}} pneumatic reactors. Gas {{put into the}} reactor in lower part imparts flow of bubbles producing continuous circulating flow of liquid (or liquid-solid). Gas itself is leaving reactor through upper part of it passing gas separator zone. Three principal types of gas-lift reactors are known: bubble column (BC), internal-loop airlift (IALR) and external-loop airlift (EALR). If in first case reactor (BC) is just <b>vertical</b> <b>vessel</b> (mainly cylindrical one), both air lifts have a riser with co-current upflow gas and liquid and a downcomer with downflow of liquid phase with entrapped bubbles moving up in relation to liquid. That means that gas is put into the riser through a sparger (gas distributor device). Amount of gas retained in reactor defines in large extent intensity of transfer phenomena in reactor - hydraulics, mass transfer, heat transfer. Its value is expressed by gas hold-up that is main parameter of gas-lift reactor performance. Basically, gas hold-up is function of flow rate of gas put into the reactor and of flow rate of gas going out from the reactor. The last one in turn depends considerably on type and dimensions of reactor, properties of gas and liquid phase. The most of authors studied gas hold-up in all reactor types at room pressure.

40|$|We have numerically {{investigated}} the axisymmetric motion of a finite-sized nearly occluding air bubble through a shear-thinning Casson fluid flowing in blood vessels of circular cross section. The numerical solution entails solving a two-layer fluid model - a cell-free layer and a non-Newtonian core {{together with the}} gas bubble. This problem is {{of interest to the}} field of rheology and for gas embolism studies in health sciences. The numerical method is based on a modified front-tracking method. The viscosity expression in the Casson model for blood (bulk fluid) includes the hematocrit [the volume fraction of red blood cells (RBCs) ] as an explicit parameter. Three different flow Reynolds numbers, Reapp=ΡlUmaxd/µapp, in the neighborhood of 0. 2, 2, and 200 are investigated. Here, Ρl is the density of blood, Umax is the centerline velocity of the inlet Casson profile, d is the diameter of the vessel, and µapp is the apparent viscosity of whole blood. Three different hematocrits have also been considered: 0. 45, 0. 4, and 0. 335. The vessel sizes considered correspond to small arteries, and small and large arterioles in normal humans. The degree of bubble occlusion is characterized by the ratio of bubble to vessel radius (aspect ratio), λ, in the range 0. 9 ≤ λ≤ 1. 05.

Calcination was defined and the evolution in the development of today's alumina calcination plants was reviewed. The whole processes (unit configuration and operation, equipment capabilities, energy consumption and efficiency, product quality, etc [...] ,) were described. Operational difficulties and successive improvements were also analysed. In these units, the major component of the equipment is the furnace (rotary kiln or stationary furnace) wherein the water of constitution of precalcined alumina crystals is expelled at high temperature (900 to 1200 °C). Overall aluminium trihydrate dehydroxylation is expressed by the following theoretical chemical reaction: Al 2 O 3, 3 H 2 O → AI 2 O 3 + 3 H 2 O(v) Special attention was given to five commercial stationary calciner furnaces which were detained and compared.

40|$|Accident {{conditions}} involving significant {{core degradation}} are termed severe accidents /IAEA: NS-G- 2. 15 /. Despite the low {{probability of occurrence}} of such events, the investigation of severe accident scenarios {{is an important part}} of the nuclear safety research. Considering a hypothetical core melt down scenario in a VVER- 1000 light water reactor, the early in-vessel phase focusing on the thermal-hydraulic phenomena, and the late in-vessel phase focusing on the melt relocation into the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) lower head, are investigated. The objective of this work is the assessment of severe accident management procedures for VVER- 1000 reactors, i. e. the estimation of the maximum period of time available for taking appropriate measures and particular decisions by the plant personnel. During high pressure severe accident sequences it is of prime importance to depressurize the primary circuit in order to allow for effective injection from the emergency core cooling systems and to avoid reactor pressure vessel failure at high pressure that could cause direct containment heating and subsequent challenge to the containment structure. Therefore different accident management measures were investigated for the in-vessel phase of a hypothetical station blackout accident using the severe accident code ASTEC, the mechanistic code ATHLET and the multi-purpose code system ANSYS. The analyses performed on the PHEBUS ISP- 46 experiment, as well as simulations of small break loss of coolant accident and station blackout scenarios were used to contribute to the validation and improvement of the integral severe accident code ASTEC. Investigations on the applicability and the effectiveness of accident management procedures in the preventive domain, as well as detailed analyses on the thermal-hydraulic phenomena during the early in-vessel phase of a station blackout accident have been performed with the mechanistic code ATHLET. The results of the simulations show, that the effectiveness of the procedures strongly depends on the ability of the passive safety systems to inject as much water as possible into the reactor coolant system. The results on the early in-vessel phase have shown potentially delayed RPV failure by depressurization of the primary side, as slowing the core damage gives more time and different possibilities for operator interventions to recover systems and to mitigate or terminate the accident. The ANSYS model for the description of the molten pool behaviour in the RPV lower plenum has been extended by a model considering a stratified molten pool configuration. Two different pool configurations were analysed: homogeneous and segregated. The possible failure modes of the RPV and the time to failure were investigated to assess the possible loadings on the containment. The main treated issues are: the temperature field within the corium pool and the RPV and the structure-mechanical behaviour of the vessel wall. The results of the ASTEC calculations of the melt pool configuration were applied as initial conditions for the ANSYS simulations, allowing a more detailed and more accurate modelling of the thermal and mechanical behaviour of the core melt and the RPV wall. Moreover, for the late in-vessel phase, retention of the corium in the RPV was investigated presuming external cooling of the vessel wall as mitigative severe accident management measure. The study was based on the finite element computer code ANSYS. The highest thermomechanical loads are observed in the transition zone between the elliptical and the <b>vertical</b> <b>vessel</b> wall for homogeneous pool and in the vertical part of the vessel wall, which is in contact with the molten metal in case of sub-oxidized pool. Assuming external flooding will retain the corium within the RPV.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) For {{the first}} time the use of {{multiple}} parallel inclined channels is investigated to enhance the segregation rate between bubble and liquid mixtures. This study has evolved from recent advances made in solid-liquid gravity separation studies using a device known as the Reflux Classifier. This system consists of a number of closely spaced parallel inclined channels, set to an angle of inclination of 70 ° to the horizontal, that are positioned above a vertical fluidization chamber. The channels act to increase the effective sedimentation area of the system, thus allowing enhanced solid-liquid segregation and solid classification when fluidizing from below a bed of solid particles. The aim of this work was to examine the processing advantage afforded to flotation processes by enhancing bubble-liquid segregation. The study firstly examines the effect of the inclined channels in enhancing liquid rejection in foam of relatively high bubble volume fraction. A series of foam fractionation experiments were conducted using the standard configuration of the Reflux Classifier, with the inclined channels located above the <b>vertical</b> <b>vessel.</b> Drift flux theory was used to describe the performance of the conventional vertical system in terms of surfactant recovery, volume reduction and enrichment. The theory demonstrated a highly constrained hydrodynamic process that is predominately one-dimensional and limited to two practical control parameters: the selection of the bubble size and gas flux employed. A further degree of freedom in the drainage of the interstitial liquid held in the foam was introduced by the inclined channels, thus permitting “drier” foam to leave the system. Experiments showed the inclined channels delivered up to a 4 fold increase in enrichment over foam flowing in the vertical direction. By increasing the residence time in the system, a 21 fold improvement in enrichment was obtained. Under certain conditions the flow rate of foam through the individual channels was found to fluctuate and transition between no flow and excessive flow. The fluctuation in flow was found to be dampened using a compressible-inflatable capacitor. The processing advantage given to foam fractionation by the inclined channels became negligible, in terms of the volume reduction and enrichment achieved, when using high gas fluxes. However, in terms of the liquid flux leaving the inclined channels, enhanced bubble-liquid segregation remained evident. Thus {{the second part of the}} thesis is concerned with operations involving lower bubble volume fractions, with a focus on bubble retention in bubbly-liquid flows rather than liquid rejection from dry, high bubble volume fraction foam. Here, an inverted fluidized bed approach was used by inverting the Reflux Classifier and applying a downwards flow of fluidization water to produce a bubble-liquid mixture. The inclined channels beneath the fluidized bed of bubbles acted to segregate the bubbles from the downwards flow of liquid, thus preventing their loss to the underflow. A concentrated bubbly zone, essentially a spherical wet foam, above the inclined channels exhibited very high permeability, permitting very high and uniform fluidization water fluxes, an order of magnitude greater than wash water fluxes used in conventional froth flotation. Fine silica particles were used to model hydraulic entrainment of hydrophilic gangue material in the froth flotation process. More than 99 % of the silica was rejected from froth product using extreme fluidization water fluxes, and gas fluxes beyond the flooding condition. Furthermore, bubble surface fluxes, S b, as high as 140 s - 1 were obtained using very fine bubbles of order 350 μm. By comparison conventional flotation systems are constrained to an optimum bubble diameter of about 1 mm and a S b generally below 60 s - 1 in order to avoid the flooding condition (Yianatos and Henríquez, 2007, Wace et al., 1968). An interesting theoretical conundrum was revealed when considering the placement of the fluidization water boundary condition. The conundrum was examined using drift flux theory. When the wash water was added at the free-surface the process is said to be flux curve constrained when using relatively high gas fluxes. In this case the wash water is transferred directly to the overflow with little or no benefit to the process. At lower gases fluxes, the process becomes flux curve unconstrained and a portion of the wash water is transferred down through the froth. However, when wash water is injected an infinitesimal level below the free-surface, at any level in the froth, the added water is transferred downwards. Fluidization water distributed in the inverted Reflux Classifier, referred to the Reflux Flotation Cell (RFC), is shown to conform to the latter theoretical solution...|$|E
