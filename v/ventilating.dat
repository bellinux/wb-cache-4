5|$|In the sub-basement {{were the}} Sprague screw {{machines}} for the electric elevators, the fire pumps, the house pumps, the ice plant, {{and the six}} Babcock & Wilcox waler tube boilers. The elevator system, which served the house from subbasement to roof, was electric, taking its power from the generating plant within the building. There were 18 elevators. The machinery was located in the sub-basement. The boilers aggregated about 3,000 horse power, the electric generators taking 2,200 horse-power of the total energy. The elevators were run by it, as were the 15,000 incandescent lamps, branching from 7,500 outlets. The system of heating and <b>ventilating</b> the public rooms was that of forced draught by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub-basement that forced the fresh air between steam-coils, where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms. This heat was further augmented by direct radiators placed behind screens in the recesses of the windows and elsewhere.|$|E

This paper studies the influence of different running modes of <b>ventilated</b> window on indoor PM 2. 5 and CO 2 concentration and the overall energy consumption.

25|$|Controlling {{water vapor}} in air {{is a key}} concern in the heating, <b>ventilating,</b> and {{air-conditioning}} (HVAC) industry. Thermal comfort depends on the moist air conditions.

This practice delivers several benefits as well as problems.|$|E

40|$|The {{issues of}} {{increasing}} the energy efficiency of buildings and reducing their operating costs are very important today. Researches on this subject show that application of <b>ventilated</b> facades improves energy efficiency of buildings an average by 30 %.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model of subtropical mode water is presented, based on <b>ventilated</b> thermocline theory and on numerical solutions of a planetary geostrophic basin model. In <b>ventilated</b> thermocline theory, the western pool is a region bounded {{on the east}} by subsurface streamlines that outcrop at {{the western edge of}} the interior, and in which additional dynamical assumptions are necessary to complete the solution. Solutions for the western pool were originally obtained under the assumption that the potential vorticity of the subsurface layer was homogenized. In the present theory, it is instead assumed that all of the water in the pool region is <b>ventilated</b> and, therefore, that all the Sverdrup transport is carried in the uppermost, outcropping layer. The result is the formation of a deep, vertically homogeneous, fluid layer in the northwest corner of the subtropical gyre that extends from the surface to the base of the <b>ventilated</b> thermocline. This <b>ventilated</b> pool is an analog of the observed subtropical mode waters. The pool also has the interesting properties that it determines its own boundaries and affects the global potential vorticity–pressure relationship. When there are multiple outcropping layers, <b>ventilated</b> pool fluid is subducted to form a set of nested annuli in <b>ventilated,</b> subsurface layers, which are the deepest subducted layers in the <b>ventilated</b> thermocline. 1...|$|R

25|$|The way windcatchers work is {{that the}} moving air masses (wind, breeze, etc.) {{at the top of}} windcatchers create a {{pressure}} gradient between the top of the windcatcher and its base, inside, {{at the bottom of the}} shaft. This pressure gradient sucks out rising hot air from inside the shaft while the colder dense air remains. The superb heat-resistant material of the walls of the ab anbar further create an insulating effect that tends to lower the temperature inside an ab anbar, similar to a cave. The <b>ventilating</b> effect of the windcatchers prevent any stagnant air and hence any dew or humidity from forming inside, and the overall effect is pure, clean, cold water all year round.|$|E
