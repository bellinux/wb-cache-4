40|$|One of {{the most}} common goals in {{manufacturing}} is to improve the quality and accuracy of the parts being fabricated without reducing productivity. Aiming at this goal, many different manufacturing processes have been developed. Among them, machining {{plays a major role in}} increasing product accuracy. As an important machining process, grinding is a vital step that can produce both fine finish and dimensional accuracy for applications in which the workpiece material is either hard or brittle. Currently, the ball screw is the most frequently used setup for grinding machine tool <b>feed</b> <b>drive.</b> However, the existence of transmission components induces wear, high friction, backlash, and also lower system stiffness; therefore, applications of conventional <b>feed</b> <b>drives</b> for high speed and high accuracy machining are very limited. As a promising technology, a linear motor <b>feed</b> <b>drive</b> discards the transmission system; therefore, it eliminates transmission induced error, such as backlash and pitch error, and avoids stiffness reduction as well. As a result, a linear motor drive can achieve both high speed and high accuracy performance. A linear motor <b>feed</b> <b>drive</b> will be subject to external disturbances such as friction, force ripple and machining force. Due to the lack of a transmission unit, the tracking behavior of a linear motor <b>feed</b> <b>drive</b> is prone to be affected by external disturbances and model parameter variations. Thus, in order to deliver high performance, a controller should be capable of achieving high accuracy in the presence of external disturbance and parameter uncertainty. This dissertation proposes a general robust motion control framework for the CNC design of a linear motor <b>feed</b> <b>drive</b> to achieve high speed/high precision as well as low speed/high precision. An application to the linear motor <b>feed</b> <b>drives</b> in grinding machines was carried out.

In order to be competitive, it is necessary to reduce the system downtime by applying sensorless automated condition monitoring (SACM). An effective and low-cost condition monitoring can be realized by avoiding additional sensors. The principal purpose is to accomplish an early recognition brought about by deviations of the normal action of a machine tool. Merely taking a look at the apparent conditions of the components does not meet the requirements. The <b>feed</b> <b>drive</b> examined is based on the typical mechanical structures in the machine tool. This thesis provides an outline on SACM-algorithms based only on signals which are available in position-controlled <b>feed</b> <b>drives</b> such as position, speed and motor current. The cause-and-effect principle is used to link phenomena in the available signals with defective changes in the mechanics. The theoretical considerations and derivations that are shown, are used for the interpretation and analysis of experiments which were performed. Phenomena in the drive signals were caused by intentionally provoking various damages. A causal connection between phenomena and damage is demonstrated by these experiments. This interconnection is in turn examined and substantiated by the cause-and-effect principle. It was achieved to set up a generally accepted categorization of the causes of the phenomena in the form damage process and damage types. The damage types can be classified by their effects and phenomena in drive signals. They are divided into periodical and non-periodical damages. Due to the analyses made, it is possible to hold as a principle: The condition of the <b>feed</b> <b>drive</b> can be determined and explained by the spectral composition of the transmitted power. There is a direct correlation between a deteriorating condition of the <b>feed</b> <b>drive</b> and increasing vibrations.
