25|$|The {{most common}} type of optical glass is crown glass, which has an index of {{refraction}} of about 1.52. An optimal single-layer coating would have to be made of a material with an index of about 1.23. Unfortunately, there are no solid materials with such a low refractive index. The closest materials with good physical properties for a coating are magnesium fluoride, MgF2 (with an index of 1.38), and fluoropolymers (which can have indices as low as 1.30, but are more difficult to apply). MgF2 on a crown glass surface gives a reflectance of about 1%, compared to 4% for bare glass. MgF2 coatings perform much better on higher-index glasses, especially those with index of refraction close to 1.9. MgF2 coatings are commonly used because they are cheap, and when they are designed for a wavelength {{in the middle of the}} <b>visible</b> <b>band,</b> they give reasonably good anti-reflection over the entire band. Researchers have produced films of mesoporous silica nanoparticles with refractive indices as low as 1.12, which function as antireflection coatings.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} concerts for {{the duration}} of the tour were also met with high praise from critics: [...] Merecedes J. Howze of New Pittsburgh Courier praised the [...] "consistent" [...] show in Cincinnati, stating [...] "The duo has proven numerous times that their union, professionally and personally, is unstoppable." [...] Howze concluded that the show was definitely a [...] "couples concert" [...] meant to be [...] "enjoy" [...] with a love partner. CityBeats Jac Kern, who attended the same show praised the duo for performing hard while fully using both of the two stages and interacting with the crowd. However he also felt that intimate moments between the couple on stage were [...] "possibly staged". The production of the tour was stated to be both large and minimal by The Boston Globe writer James Read who commented that only a few performers could manage to pull off a production of On The Run's scale. He continued his review, [...] "Nor is there much to behold beyond its stars: no long catwalks, elaborate sets, or even a <b>visible</b> <b>band.</b> With Beyoncé and Jay-Z, two natural-born entertainers, you do not need much more." [...] Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press reported that the set list of the show emulated a conversation told through songs; he noted that despite the concert being a collaborative tour, [...] "it was the performers' emotional solo material that made their presence as a collaborative duo strong and resilient". The first Canadian show of the tour was again well received by critics. Graham Slaughter of the Toronto Star concluded in his review, [...] "If there's anything to be learned from the On the Run tour, it's that tight timing, a dynamic storyline and legendary talent make a 42-song concert not just enjoyable, but rather unforgettable. Performers be warned: the bar on dual concerts has forever been raised." [...] Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times who attended the first of two shows in Pasadena, California, also gave a positive review noting that the concert showcased how a marriage should work with the spouses [...] "balancing out each other's weaknesses with individual strengths" [...] on stage. Ali went on praising the stage interactions between the pair such as kissing and toggling and concluded, [...] "Whether it was a carefully orchestrated act or not, they are a great team." ...|$|E

I lay four months in the coldest season {{of the year in}} a haystack in my father’s garden, and a whole February in the open fields not far from Camragen, and this I did without the least prejudice from the night air; one night, when lying in the fields near to the Carrick-Miln, I was all covered with snow in the morning. Many nights have I lain with pleasure in the churchyard of Old Daily, and made a grave my pillow; frequently have I resorted to the old walls about the glen, near to Camragen, and there sweetly rested.’ The <b>visible</b> <b>band</b> of God protected and directed him. Dragoons were turned aside from the bramble-bush where he lay hidden. Miracles were performed for his behoof. ‘I got a horse and a woman to carry the child, and came to the same mountain, where I wandered by the mist before; it is commonly known by the name of Kellsrhins: when we came to go up the mountain, there came on a great rain, which we thought was the occasion of the child’s weeping, and she wept so bitterly, that all we could do could not divert her from it, so that she was ready to burst. When we got {{to the top of the}} mountain, where the Lord had been formerly kind to my soul in prayer, I looked round me for a stone, and espying one, I went and brought it. When the woman with me saw me set down the stone, she smiled, and asked what I was going to do with it. I told her I was going to set it up as my Ebenezer, because hitherto, and in that place, the Lord had formerly helped, and I hoped would yet help. The rain still continuing, the child weeping bitterly, I went to prayer, and no sooner did I cry to God, but the child gave over weeping, and when we got up from prayer, the rain was pouring down on every side, but in the way where we were to go there fell not one drop; the place not rained on was as big as an ordinary avenue.’ And so great a saint was the natural butt of Satan’s persecutions. ‘I retired to the fields for secret prayer about mid-night. When I went to pray I was much straitened, and could not get one request, but “Lord pity,” “Lord help”; this I came over frequently; at length the terror of Satan fell on me in a high degree, and all I could say even then was—“Lord help.” I continued in the duty for some time, notwithstanding of this terror. At length I got up to my feet, and the terror still increased; then the enemy took me by the arm-pits, and seemed to lift me up by my arms. I saw a loch just before me, and I concluded he designed to throw me there by force; and had he got leave to do so, it might have brought a great reproach upon religion. {7a} But it was otherwise ordered, and the cause of piety escaped that danger. {7b} ...|$|E

30|$|To {{decrease}} both information redundancy and {{the number}} of layers used for the unsupervised classification (Frankovich, 1999), two image transformations were used; principal components analysis (PCA) and tasseled cap (TC) transformation.

Two PCAs were applied separately to Landsat TM/ETM+; (i) on the <b>visible</b> <b>bands</b> 1, 2 and 3 and (ii) on the mid-infrared bands 5 and 7, since they are highly correlated. The infra-red band 4 was left untouched as it is less correlated to either the <b>visible</b> <b>bands</b> or the mid-infra-red band. This reduced the number of layers from six to three.|$|R
40|$|Lyzenga’s {{method is}} used widely for {{radiative}} transfer analysis {{because of its}} simplicity of application to cases of shallow-water coral reef ecosystems with limited information of water properties. WorldView- 2 imagery has been used previously to study bottom-type identification in shallow-water coral reef habitats. However, {{this is the first}} time WorldView- 2 imagery has been applied to bottom-type identification using Lyzenga’s method. This research applied both of Lyzenga’s methods: the original from 1981 and the one from 2006 with improved noise correction that uses the near-infrared (NIR) band. The objectives of this study are to examine whether the utilization of NIR bands in the correction of atmospheric and sea-surface scattering improves the accuracy of bottom classification, and whether increasing the number of <b>visible</b> <b>bands</b> also improves accuracy. Firstly, it has been determined that the improved 2006 correction method, which uses NIR bands, is only more accurate than the original 1981 correction method in the case of three <b>visible</b> <b>bands.</b> When applying six bands, the accuracy of the 1981 correction method is better than that of the 2006 correction method. Secondly, the increased number of <b>visible</b> <b>bands,</b> when applied to Lyzenga’s empirical radiative transfer model, improves the accuracy of bottom classification significantly...|$|R

50|$|The {{dominant}} frequency (or color) {{range of the}} emitted radiation shifts to higher frequencies as {{the temperature of the}} emitter increases.
