5|$|In Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī's (973–1048) Shadows, {{non-uniform}} {{motion is}} described {{as the result of}} acceleration. Ibn-Sina's theory of mayl tried to relate the <b>velocity</b> <b>and</b> weight of a moving object, a precursor of the concept of momentum. Aristotle's theory of motion stated that a constant force produces a uniform motion; Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī (c. 1080 – 1164/5) disagreed, arguing that <b>velocity</b> <b>and</b> acceleration are two different things, and that force is proportional to acceleration, not to velocity.|$|E
5|$|All three text-based games {{require the}} player {{to control a}} rocket {{attempting}} {{to land on the}} moon by entering instructions to the rocket in a turn-based system in response to the textual summary of its current position and velocity relative to the ground. In the original Lunar, players controlled only the amount of vertical thrust to apply, based on their current vertical <b>velocity</b> <b>and</b> remaining fuel, with each round representing one second of travel time. Rocket added a simple text-based graphical display of the distance from the ground in each round, while LEM added horizontal <b>velocity</b> <b>and</b> the ability to apply thrust at an angle. In 1970 and 1971, DEC employee and editor of the newsletter David H. Ahl converted two early mainframe games, Lunar and Hamurabi, from the FOCAL language to BASIC, partially as a demonstration of the language on the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. Their popularity led him to start printing BASIC games in the DEC newsletter, both his own and reader submissions.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} is {{a method}} of operating a robot in successive sampling intervals to perform a task, the robot having joints and joint actuators with actuator control loops, by decomposing the task into behavior forces, accelerations, <b>velocities</b> <b>and</b> positions of plural behaviors to be exhibited by the robot simultaneously, computing actuator accelerations of the joint actuators for the current sampling interval from both behavior forces, accelerations <b>velocities</b> <b>and</b> positions of the current sampling interval <b>and</b> actuator <b>velocities</b> <b>and</b> positions of the previous sampling interval, computing actuator <b>velocities</b> <b>and</b> positions of the joint actuators for the current sampling interval from the actuator <b>velocities</b> <b>and</b> positions of the previous sampling interval, and, finally, controlling the actuators {{in accordance with the}} actuator accelerations, <b>velocities</b> <b>and</b> positions of the current sampling interval.

30|$|We {{also find}} the {{correlation}} between the effect of K and that of φ k on elastic properties, which impact elastic properties of shale simultaneously. Due to low <b>velocities</b> <b>and</b> density, the increase in K decreases <b>velocities</b> <b>and</b> density, and the presence of φ k enhances such impacts (as shown in Fig.  1). For K <  0.05, the effect of φ k on the elastic properties is not obvious; for K >  0.05, the increase in φ k significantly decreases <b>velocities</b> <b>and</b> density of shales.|$|R
30|$|The pore-fluid {{pressure}} and confining pressure have influences on <b>velocities</b> <b>and</b> conductivity {{in the opposite}} directions. When the confining pressure was kept constant, velocities decreased but conductivity increased with increasing pore-fluid pressure. The increase in pore-fluid pressure must open pores to decrease <b>velocities</b> <b>and</b> increase conductivity.|$|R

There is a {{substantial}} asymmetry between leading and trailing hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3 times brighter than the trailing one.

5|$|A steepening of the {{subduction}} zone during the Late Miocene {{has been linked}} to an increase in volcanic activity and its westward migration, but {{it is unlikely that the}} pattern of activity in the southern Puna next to the Toro fault zone can be explained through this alone.

5|$|Kennedy {{defeated}} Funaki {{once again}} in his SmackDown! debut on August 25, 2005. Kennedy also created an ongoing mini-feud with SmackDown! ring announcer Tony Chimel, based on Kennedy believing that Chimel's announcing was not done well enough or with sufficient respect, and therefore performing his own introductions or forcing Chimel to introduce him again. Kennedy's self-ring introductions before the match became one of his trademarks. While working on both <b>Velocity</b> <b>and</b> SmackDown!, he was also still working in OVW. Kennedy made his pay-per-view debut at SmackDown!'s No Mercy, defeating Hardcore Holly and injuring Holly's ribs during the match.|$|E
5|$|Kepler {{began by}} {{exploring}} regular polygons and regular solids, including the figures {{that would come}} to be known as Kepler's solids. From there, he extended his harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies—and in the case of astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls. In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between orbital <b>velocity</b> <b>and</b> orbital distance from the Sun. Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler—with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories—treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the figures}} used in the {{calculation}} of the bomb's trajectory were based on fixed values, and were entered before the mission started. In particular, the terminal velocity {{was based on the}} type of bomb being dropped and did not change during the mission. This was used to calculate how steep the path of the bomb would be when dropped from high altitudes; at lower altitudes and airspeeds, the bomb did not reach terminal <b>velocity</b> <b>and</b> followed a more parabolic path. Other measures were only entered as the aircraft approached the target.|$|E
5|$|The Kolberg class {{represented}} {{the first major}} improvement in combat power for German light cruisers, both qualitatively and quantitatively. They were armed with the longer-barrel 10.5 cm SK L/45 gun, which had a higher muzzle <b>velocity</b> <b>and</b> thus greater range than the earlier L/40 weapon. In addition, they carried an extra pair of guns, which strengthened their broadside. This was on a displacement of over a thousand tons greater than the preceding Dresden class. All four ships were also powered by turbines, which granted them {{a significant increase in}} speed over the earlier vessels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The inverse {{dynamic model}} allows {{to compute the}} torques {{for each of the}} degrees of freedom of a robot knowing the positions, <b>velocities</b> <b>and</b> accelerations. In contrast, direct dynamic model is used to {{calculate}} the positions, <b>velocities</b> <b>and</b> accelerations knowing the torques for each of the degrees of freedom. Most of the times is difficult to obtain the direct dynamic model analytically because it is given by solution of the differential equations for each variable.
