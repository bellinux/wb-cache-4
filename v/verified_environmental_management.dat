40|$|Arguments that <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> can {{positively}} {{relate to}} the operational performance of companies have been spreading the literature since the 1990 s. This approach became known as "green and competitive" or "Win-Win Scenario", where both the environment and companies would benefit from the adoption of green management practices. However, there is a theoretical and empirical gap on this topic, it lacks empirical evidence to validate or refute these arguments to the Brazilian reality. Therefore, this research aims to empirically <b>verify</b> whether the <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> positively influences the operational performance of companies in the Brazilian automotive industry, focusing on the segment of automotive parts and components. Methodologically, we carried out a survey of 75 firms. The {{data were analyzed using}} Structural Equation Modeling, a multivariate analysis of secondgeneration. The main results indicate that the adoption of <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> practices relates positively with the operational performance. But this operational performance is weakly explained by the research framework. This fact indicates that others organizational variables could be influencing the firm's operational performance.

The hypothesized relationships {{of this model}} are tested with data collected from 309 international manufacturing firms (IMSS IV) by using AMOS. The findings suggest that prior lean manufacturing experiences are positively related to <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> practices. <b>Environmental</b> <b>management</b> practices alone are negatively related to market and financial performance. However, improved environmental performance substantially reduces {{the negative impact of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> practices on market and financial performance. The paper provides empirical evidences with large sample size that <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> practices become an important mediating variable to resolve the conflicts between lean manufacturing and environmental performance.

40|$|Although {{environmental}} sustainability {{has emerged as}} an important organizational capability {{to protect the environment}} and sustain businesses, there is little knowledge on how it is developed. This is of particular importance when <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> no longer relies solely on an individual firm's efforts, but on its supply chain partners as well. Building on dynamic capabilities theory, environmental information integration (EII) is defined as the organizational capacity of sharing information on <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> with supply chain partners to facilitate coordination of <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> practices. This study examines how EII contributes to <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> capabilities in terms of corporate environmental innovativeness and adaptability. The research model is empirically tested using data collected from 230 firms. The findings show that supplier EII is insufficient in improving <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> capabilities. Internal EII contributes to corporate environmental adaptability, while customer EII engenders both corporate environmental innovativeness and adaptability. This study suggests that strategic values of EII go beyond the sharing of <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> information between supply chain partners, simultaneously contributing to the <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> capabilities of firms. This study contributes substantially to <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> research by providing empirical evidence on the specific dimensions of EII in supply chains that contribute to <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> capabilities and business values.

40|$|To check rapidly deteriorating <b>environmental</b> conditions, many <b>management</b> {{tools are}} being used by {{different}} industries. In order to address environmental issues the corporate sector has seen a drastic increase {{in the use of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> systems. There is strong need to check how these <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> systems are rendering <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> services. Research shows that <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> systems are mistakenly expected to prescribe technical and environmental objectives. Without describing what goals an organization must achieve, they lay out a system for <b>management</b> of numerous <b>environmental</b> obligations. Hence <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> systems are not strategic; they tend to reactively fix issues contingent upon their occurrence and may miss opportunities to avoid problems before they occur. Further, <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> itself is seen in isolation of a socio-ecological context, which makes <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> lose ground and operate in a virtual vacuum. Mostly <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> is identified as an ’agenda’ which runs counter to the overall development of an organization. Provided, <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> systems can be integrated with basic principles of sustainable development these management systems can be utilized as a launching pad to move organizations towards sustainability. Built to render the administrative services only through a mechanism of self regulation and continuous improvement, these management systems can be used to deliver sustainable product planning. The present study illustrates the possibilities for integration of sustainability objectives into <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> systems. In our effort to integrate sustainability in environment management systems extensive literature reviews, interviews and a case study (Hammarplast AB) have been used. For the analysis of the current reality, a framework for strategic sustainable development and methods incorporating “backcasting from principles of sustainability” – i. e. templates for sustainable product development and strategic life cycle management – has been used.

This portfolio {{presents the results of}} a project that examined the development of <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> in a large multi-national corporation over a four year period. The aim of the project was to "institutionalise" <b>environmental</b> <b>management,</b> in other words to ensure that <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> was considered part of normal business practice and not a well intentioned afterthought. This was achieved through an in-depth case study using action research methods to facilitate and record organisational change simultaneously. The research demonstrated that previous accounts of <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> in industry have failed to provide an adequate analysis of the changes required to institutionalise <b>environmental</b> <b>management.</b> This is shown to be partly attributable to the dominance of the quantitative, outsider-based research methods. The research makes three principal contributions to knowledge: Identifying and describing four different levels of change required for the institutionalisation of <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> in a comprehensive study Identifying factors affecting the institutionalisation of <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> in an industrial setting Demonstrating the usefulness and validity of insider-based methodologies for <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> research. In this Portfolio it is argued that the institutionalisation of <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> requires change at multiple levels and that the observation and further clarification of these levels can be achieved through insider-based research methods. At a practictioner level, it is recommended that industrial managers reconsider their strategies for achieving the institutionalisation of <b>environmental</b> <b>management.</b> In particular, company-wide employee awareness programmes and/or policy driven management systems only go part way towards achieving an institutionalised approach. An approach,in line with existing organisational roles, culture and objectives is recommended. Further, as <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> becomes considered as part of normal business practice, it is recommended that researchers identify the boundaries between <b>environmental</b> and other <b>management</b> research to reflect industrial practice...|$|R
