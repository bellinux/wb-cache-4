40|$|This {{engineering}} note provides {{background information}} regarding the control dewar secondary <b>vacuum</b> <b>container.</b> The secondary <b>vacuum</b> <b>container</b> has it's origin with the CDP control dewar design. The name secondary <b>vacuum</b> <b>container</b> replaced the CDP term 'Watt can' which was named after Bob Watt (SLAC), a PAC/DOE review committee member who participated {{in a review of}} CDP and recommended a secondary vacuum enclosure. One of the most fragile parts of the control dewar design is the ceramic electrical feed throughs located in the secondary <b>vacuum</b> <b>container.</b> The secondary <b>vacuum</b> <b>container</b> is provided to guard against potential leaks in these ceramic insulating feed throughs. The secondary <b>vacuum</b> <b>container</b> has a pumping line separate from the main solenoid/control dewar insulating vacuum. This pumping line is connected to the inlet of the turbo pump for initial pumpdown. Under normal operation the container is isolated. Should a feedthrough develop a small leak, alternate pumping arrangements for the secondary <b>vacuum</b> <b>container</b> could be arranged. The pressure in the secondary <b>vacuum</b> <b>container</b> should be kept in a range that the breakdown voltage is kept at a maximum. The breakdown voltage is known to be a function of pressure and is described by a Paschen curve. I cannot find a copy of the curve at this time, but from what I remember, the breakdown voltage is a minimum somewhere around 10 - 3 torr. Ideally the pressure in the secondary vacuum can should be kept very low, around 10 E- 6 or 10 E- 7 torr for maximum breakdown voltage.

Based {{on the average}} concentrations of (1. 92 ± 0. 12) ppm U and (10. 1 ± 1. 22) ppm Th measured on 4 rock samples from the Callovo-Oxfordian formation, a 4 He production rate of (5. 2 ± 0. 4) x 10 - 13 cm 3 STP/g rock. y is calculated (STP = Standard Temperature and Pressure; T = 0 °C, p = 1 atm = 1. 013 x 105 Pa). Multiplied {{with an average age}} of 165 million years of the sediments the total amount of in-situ produced helium can be calculated. Comparison of this value with measured He-concentrations in rocks shows that more than 96 % of the helium has been lost from the solid phase and was transferred to the porewater. For an average grain density of 2. 66 g/cm 3 of rock and an average water-content porosity of 0. 15 cm 3 water/cm 3 rock the helium accumulation rate in porewater is (7. 5 ± 0. 6) x 10 - 12 cm 3 STP 4 He/cm 3 water. y.

500|$|Sugarcane {{refers to}} any of several species, or their hybrids, of giant grasses in the genus Saccharum [...] in the family Poaceae. They have been {{cultivated}} in tropical climates in South Asia and Southeast Asia since ancient times for the sucrose that is found in their stems. A great expansion in sugarcane production {{took place in the}} 18th century with the establishment of slave plantations in the Americas. The use of slavery meant that {{this was the first time}} that sugar became cheap enough for most people, who previously had to rely on honey to sweeten foods. It requires a frost-free climate with sufficient rainfall during the growing season to make full use of the plant's great growth potential. The crop is harvested mechanically or by hand, chopped into lengths and conveyed rapidly to the processing plant (commonly known as a sugar mill). Here, it is either milled and the juice extracted with water or extracted by diffusion. The juice is then clarified with lime and heated to destroy enzymes. The resulting thin syrup is concentrated in a series of evaporators, after which further water is removed by evaporation in <b>vacuum</b> <b>containers.</b> The resulting supersaturated solution is seeded with sugar crystals and the sugar crystallizes out and is separated from the fluid and dried. Molasses is a by-product of the process and the fiber from the stems, known as bagasse, is burned to provide energy for the sugar extraction process. The crystals of raw sugar have a sticky brown coating and either can be used as they are or can be bleached by sulfur dioxide or can be treated in a carbonatation process to produce a whiter product. [...] About [...] of irrigation water is needed for every one kilogram of sugar produced.|$|R
50|$|A vacuum is {{initially}} created by connecting a closed <b>container</b> to a <b>vacuum</b> pump.

Getters are especially important in sealed systems, such as vacuum tubes, including cathode ray tubes (CRTs), and vacuum insulated panels, which must maintain a vacuum {{for a long time}}. This is because the inner surfaces of the container release absorbed gases {{for a long time after}} the vacuum is established. The getter continually removes this residual gas as it is produced. Even in systems which are continually evacuated by a vacuum pump, getters are also used to remove residual gas, often to achieve a higher vacuum than the pump could achieve alone. Although it weighs almost nothing and has no moving parts, a getter is itself a vacuum pump.|$|R

A longer attenuation length is needed in order to construct a telescope with a large detection area.
