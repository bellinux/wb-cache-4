However, such printing is accompanied by new challenges. The presence of gels, black specks and other contaminations in these films does not allow the surrounding area to print, thus resulting in print void. The occurrence of this defect in a considerable amount or size on the area of interest leads to the rejection of printed stock that involves wastage of inks, solvents and time. The research involves the investigation of the effect of gravure process variables on the minimization of print voids in Shrink PVC film. The gravure process variables viz. <b>viscosity,</b> <b>pressure,</b> speed and hardness were identified for the indirect laser cylinder.
