50|$|The Hot Zone has {{received}} criticism for sensationalizing {{the effects of}} Ebola virus. In their memoir Level 4: <b>Virus</b> <b>Hunters</b> of the CDC, former CDC scientists Joseph B. McCormick and Susan Fisher-Hoch lambaste Preston for claiming that Ebola dissolves organs, stating that although it causes great blood loss in tissues the organs remain structurally intact. McCormick and Fisher-Hoch also dispute Preston's version of the CDC's actions in the Reston virus incident.|$|R

Although primates and other species may be intermediates, evidence suggests people primarily get the <b>virus</b> from bats. <b>Hunters</b> usually shoot, net, scavenge or catapult their prey, and butcher the bats without gloves, getting bites or scratches and coming in contact with their blood.|$|R

40|$|Wild boars {{can carry}} the {{hepatitis}} E <b>virus</b> (HEV). For <b>hunters,</b> {{direct contact with}} wild boars during field dressing for producing game meat therefore poses an increased infection risk. A study coordinated by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and conducted in close cooperation with the competent authorities of an administrative district, the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, and the Robert Koch-Institute investigated the distribution of HEV and HEV-specific antibodies in hunters of that administrative district and also in wild boars within the relevant hunting territories. In addition, the study succeeded in identifying the risk and protective factors of HEV transmission to hunters. Analysis of the collected data showed that the detection rate for HEV-specific antibodies for hunters who often wear gloves when eviscerating animals is 88 % lower than for those hunters who disembowelled hunted game without gloves. This means that wearing gloves when eviscerating and carving up wild boars is an effective protection measure to prevent transmission of HEV.

40|$|Abstract The {{design of}} ‘hunter’ viruses aimed at {{destroying}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) infected cells is an active area of research that has produced promising results in vitro. Hunters are designed to target exposed viral envelope proteins in the membranes of infected cells, but {{there is evidence that}} the hunter may also target envelope proteins of free HIV, inducing virus-virus fusion. In order to predict the effects of this fusion on therapy outcomes and determine whether fusion ability is advantageous for <b>hunter</b> <b>virus</b> design, we have constructed a model to account for the possibility of hunter-HIV fusion. The study was based on a target cell-limited model of HIV infection and it examined the hunter therapeutic effect on recovering the HIV main target cells, the activated CD 4 + T lymphocytes. These cells assist in setting up an immune response to opportunistic infections. The study analyzed the hunter dual mechanisms to control infection and because of diverse estimates for viral production and clearance of HIV, simulations were examined at rates spanning an order of magnitude. Results indicate that without hunter-HIV fusion ability, hunters that kill HIV-infected cells lead to a substantial recovery of healthy cell population at both low and high HIV turnover rates. When hunter-HIV fusion is included, cell recovery was particularly enhanced at lower HIV turnover rates. This study shows that the fusion ability, in addition to hunter infection ability, could be a favorable attribute for improving the efficacy of hunter-viral therapy. These results provide support for the potential use of engineered viruses to control HIV and other viral infections. </p...|$|R
