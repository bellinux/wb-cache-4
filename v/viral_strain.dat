40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} based on genetic distances among <b>viral</b> <b>strains</b> to infer about risk exposures and location of transmission at population level. METHODS: We re-analysed 133 viral sequences obtained during a cross-sectional survey of 4020 subjects living in a hepatitis C virus (HCV) endemic area in 2002. A permutation {{test was used to}} analyze the correlation between matrices of genetic distances in the NS 5 b region of all pairwise combinations of the 133 <b>viral</b> <b>strains</b> and exposure status (jointly exposed or not) to several potential HCV risk factors. RESULTS: Compared to subjects who did not share the same characteristics or iatrogenic exposures, the median Kimura genetic distances of <b>viral</b> <b>strains</b> were significantly smaller between brothers and sisters (0. 031 versus 0. 102, P< 0. 001), mother and child (0. 044 versus 0. 102, P< 0. 001), father and child (0. 045 versus 0. 102, P< 0. 001), or subjects exposed to periodontal treatment (0. 084 versus 0. 102, P =  0. 02). Conversely, <b>viral</b> <b>strains</b> were more divergent between subjects exposed to blood transfusions (0. 216 versus 0. 102, P =  0. 04) or tooth filling or extraction (0. 108, versus 0. 097, P =  0. 05), suggesting acquisition of the virus outside of the village. CONCLUSION: This method provided insights on where infection took place (household, village) for several socio-demographic characteristics or iatrogenic procedures, information of great relevance for targeting prevention interventions. This method may have interesting applications for virologists and epidemiologists studying transmission networks in health-care facilities or among intravenous drug users...|$|R
40|$|Our study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} the distribution, persistence and interchange of <b>viral</b> <b>strains</b> among {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC), plasma and saliva of primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection subjects.

To survey the <b>viral</b> <b>strains,</b> genotyping assays for the natural polymorphisms in two latent EBV genes, EBNA 2 and LMP 1, were performed and consisted of real-time PCR on EBNA 2 to distinguish type 1 and 2 viruses, fluorescent-based 30 -bp typing assay on LMP 1 to distinguish deletion and wild type LMP 1, and fluorescent-based heteroduplex tracking assays on both EBNA 2 and LMP 1 to distinguish defined polymorphic variants.

40|$|Post-traumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder {{that can occur}} after exposure to extreme traumatic experience such as war trauma, and is accompanied by fear, helplessness or horror. Exposure to trauma can result in immune dysregulation and influence susceptibility to infectious disease as well as vaccine efficacy. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the relation of psychological stress and the immune response to influenza vaccination in combat-related PTSD patients (n = 28). Detection of anti-viral antibody titre was performed by inhibition of haemagglutination assay. Ex vivo tetramer staining of CD 8 + T lymphocytes was used to monitor T cells specific for human leucocyte antigen (HLA) -A* 0201 -restricted influenza A haemagglutinin antigens before and after vaccination. Twenty patients showed a fourfold antibody titre increase to one or both influenza A <b>viral</b> <b>strains,</b> and 18 of them showed the same response for both influenza B <b>viral</b> <b>strains.</b> Ten of 15 healthy controls showed a fourfold rise in antibody titre to both influenza A <b>viral</b> <b>strains</b> and eight of them showed the same response for both influenza B <b>viral</b> <b>strains.</b> HLA-A* 0201 + PTSD patients (n = 10) showed a significant increase of influenza-specific CD 8 T cells after vaccination. Although those PTSD patients had a lower number of influenza-specific CD 8 + T cells before vaccination compared to HLA-A* 0201 + healthy controls (n = 6), there was no difference in influenza A antibody titre between PTSD patients and control subjects before vaccination. The generated humoral and cellular immune response in PTSD patients argues against the hypothesis that combat-related PTSD in war veterans might affect protection following influenza vaccination...|$|R

50|$|PVY {{infection}} of potato plants {{results in a}} variety of symptoms depending on the <b>viral</b> <b>strain.</b> The mildest of these symptoms is production loss, but the most detrimental is 'potato tuber necrotic ringspot disease' (PTNRD).

50|$|A {{burst of}} {{research}} on viruses of E. histolytica stems {{from a series of}} papers published by Diamond et al. from 1972 to 1979. In 1972, they hypothesized two separate polyhedral and filamentous <b>viral</b> <b>strains</b> within E. histolytica that caused cell lysis. Perhaps the most novel observation was that two kinds of <b>viral</b> <b>strains</b> existed, and that within one type of amoeba (strain HB-301) the polyhedral strain had no detrimental effect but led to cell lysis in another (strain HK-9). Although Mattern et al. attempted to explore the possibility that these protozoal viruses could function like bacteriophages, they found no significant changes in Entamoeba histolytica virulence when infected by viruses. However, no newer published research has been conducted on this species since.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{intravenous}} drug user {{was found to be}} dually infected with two genetically and phylogenetically distinct human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) subtype B strains (designated groups I and II). Viral isolation revealed a simultaneous copassaging of two strains in PBMC. The culture of <b>viral</b> <b>strains</b> on monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages preferentially segregated the two <b>viral</b> <b>strains.</b> The group I strain utilized CXCR 4 and group II used CCR 5 coreceptor for entry. Sequencing of > 100 clones from uncultured PBMC consistently showed the predominance of group II virus in vivo. Importantly, the group II virus alone could not productively infect PBMC, but when used together with group I virus for infection, the group II virus regained its high replication potential and predominance in cultured PBMC. These data are the first to provide direct evidence in favor of molecular and biological interaction between two infecting strains in a coinfected patient and show their differential pathogenic effects, tropism, and modes of entry. In addition, our data provide the first evidence for synergism between these two strains. Cumulatively, these data emphasize that in order to clearly interpret coreceptor usage, biological segregation of <b>viral</b> <b>strains</b> from primary isolates in vitro may be imperative...|$|R

Feline Enteric Coronavirus is shed in the feces and can be passed on to other cats; however, it must undergo a mutation in order to lead to FIP.

This multifactorial nature is what accounts, in part, for the disparity between viral prevalence and disease incidence. This form is only found in macrophages and is therefore not shed and not contagious.|$|E

50|$|Vaccines {{created through}} reverse {{genetics}} methods {{are known as}} attenuated vaccines, named because they contain weakened (attenuated) live viruses. Attenuated vaccines are created by combining genes from a novel or current virus strain with previously attenuated viruses of the same species.

40|$|Acquisition of {{more than}} one strain of human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) has been reported to occur both during and after primary infection, but the risks and repercussions of dual and superinfection are incompletely understood. In this study, we evaluated a longitudinal cohort of chronically HIV-infected men who were sexual partners to determine if individuals acquired their partners' <b>viral</b> <b>strains.</b> Our cohort of HIV-positive men consisted of 8 couples that identified themselves as long-term sexual partners. Viral sequences were isolated from each subject and analyzed using phylogenetic methods. In addition, strain-specific PCR allowed us to search for partners' viruses present at low levels. Finally, we used computational algorithms to evaluate for recombination between partners' <b>viral</b> <b>strains.</b> All couples had at least one factor associated with increased risk for acquisition of new HIV strains during the study, including detectable plasma viral load, sexually transmitted infections, and unprotected sex. One subject was dually HIV- 1 infected, but neither strain corresponded to that of his partner. Three couples' sequences formed monophyletic clusters at the entry visit, with phylogenetic analysis suggesting that one member of the couple had acquired an HIV strain from his identified partner or that both had acquired it from the same source outside their partnership. The 5 remaining couples initially displayed no evidence of dual infection, using phylogenetic analysis and strain-specific PCR. However, in 1 of these couples, further analysis revealed recombinant <b>viral</b> <b>strains</b> with segments of viral genomes in one subject that may have derived from the enrolled partner. Thus, chronically HIV- 1 infected individuals may become superinfected with additional HIV strains from their seroconcordant sexual partners. In some cases, HIV- 1 superinfection may become apparent when recombinant <b>viral</b> <b>strains</b> are detected...|$|R
