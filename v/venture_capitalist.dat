However, under both schemes, experienced <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists</b> save on management support. This paper shows that offering <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists</b> a choice between these two schemes can lead to a positive self-selection.

40|$|Cross-border {{venture capital}} {{investing}} {{has increased dramatically}} {{over the last two}} decades. Previous research has shown that foreign <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists</b> tend to partner with local <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists</b> as a strategy for offsetting information asymmetries and liabilities of foreignness. This paper examines the choice of co-investors by foreign <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists</b> investing in the Chinese market. We find that foreign investors are more likely to choose Chinese investors in later investment rounds and in more mature portfolio firms. More experienced foreign venture capital firms are less likely to co-invest with Chinese <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists.</b> Also, having a Chinese office made foreign <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists</b> less likely to co-invest. In seed-stage investments, when risks are the greatest, foreign firms are least likely to co-invest with Chinese <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists,</b> while at the later stage, when risks are presumably the lowest is when they are most likely to co-invest. During this period, the propensity to co-invest with Chinese <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists</b> increased significantly in every stage except the seed stage. ...|$|R

The behavior of independent and corporate <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists</b> is more similar to that of US funds whereas bank-dependent and public ven- ture capitalists typically are bridge investors rather than true <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists.</b> Our findings may be interesting for policy makers, for companies that seek capital and for <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists</b> who look for syndication partners.

40|$|In this paper, I {{review the}} {{existing}} literature in order to elucidate the investment processes of <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists</b> from the pre-investment stage to the post-investment stage, {{with a focus on}} <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists</b> who invest in new technology based firms. Additionally, I discuss factors associated with growth stages and factors associated with technology separately, with regard to the function of these <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists.</b> With respect to investment processes of <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists,</b> Manigart et at al. claimed that the post-investment activities of <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists</b> will influence the rate of required return in pre-investment valuations. Bygrave and Timmons discussed the function of <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists</b> that revolves around the growth stages, and stated that <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists</b> that invest in early stage ventures must have, in addition to the astute ability to select promising portfolio firms, the ability to support and add value to the portfolio firms after investment. With respect to <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists</b> that invest in new technology based firms, Pfirrmann et al identified 3 types of risk; i. e. business risk, innovation risks and financial risks. Baum and Silverman maintain that <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists</b> investing in new technology based firms are likely to consistently combine both scouting for excellent technology as well as being able to coach by imparting management skills. With the rise of the developing nations, and the escalation of global economic competition, the commercialization and industrialization of new technologies such as biotechnology and nanotechnology is promising for the revitalization of the economies of Japan and other industrialized nations. The creation of ventures based on these new technologies is one of the important options for commercialization and industrialization, and it is desirable that during this creation process, <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists</b> not simply parasite high-tech entrepreneurs, but instead provide value to them and exercise originality...|$|R

By surveying the population of European and US philanthropic <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists,</b> results suggest that they originate and select deals similarly to traditional <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists.</b> However, they also adopt different deal origination criteria which are not traditionally used by <b>venture</b> <b>capitalists,</b> such as, incubation and direct creation of an organization {{in the event of}} not finding a suitable one.

40|$|Life science {{technologies}} {{are some of}} the most comprehensive and difficult to evaluate as investment opportunities. If <b>Venture</b> <b>Capitalists</b> can only invest in a specific number of portfolio investments, it is crucial that the investment opportunities chosen are those that are also the most likely to succeed. Investor perception risks due to lack of qualification, technology comprehension, information asymmetry or overconfidence, are factors that may limit <b>Venture</b> <b>Capitalists</b> from choosing investments that create wealth. To date, little research has been dedicated into the understanding of risk perception and technology comprehension among <b>Venture</b> <b>Capitalists</b> who specialize in life science investment opportunities. This study included a literature review as well as nineteen (19) semi-formal interviews with <b>Venture</b> <b>Capitalists</b> located on the West Coast of Canada and United States. Results show that interviewed <b>Venture</b> <b>Capitalists</b> are, overall, qualified in making life science investment decisions. However, results also showed that there are trends towards Venture Capital adverse selection and overconfidence during investment selection, particularly with respect to personal performance. Results further showed that adverse selection may occur simply as a way of reducing risk, particularly information asymmetry risk. In these instances it appears that opportunity selection is geared towards selection of known and trusted management rather than actual investment opportunity. Differences between West Coast Canadian and United States <b>Venture</b> <b>Capitalists</b> were also found. These differences specifically included the degree to which selection risks are taken, where interviews Canadian <b>Venture</b> <b>Capitalists</b> appeared to be more ethical and cautious investors, and interviewed United States <b>Venture</b> <b>Capitalists</b> were concerned with creating wealth out of innovative technologies in a wide variety of geographical locations.
