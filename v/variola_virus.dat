5|$|Smallpox {{is caused}} by {{infection}} with <b>variola</b> <b>virus,</b> which belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus, the family Poxviridae and subfamily chordopoxvirinae.|$|E
5|$|Four orthopoxviruses cause {{infection}} in humans: variola, vaccinia, cowpox, and monkeypox. <b>Variola</b> <b>virus</b> infects only humans in nature, although primates {{and other animals}} have been infected in a laboratory setting. Vaccinia, cowpox, and monkeypox viruses can infect both humans and other animals in nature.|$|E
5|$|Definitive {{laboratory}} {{identification of}} <b>variola</b> <b>virus</b> involves growing the virus on chorioallantoic membrane (part of a chicken embryo) and examining the resulting pock lesions under defined temperature conditions. Strains may {{be characterized by}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) analysis. Serologic tests and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), which measure variola virus-specific immunoglobulin and antigen have also been developed to assist in the diagnosis of infection.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{complete}} {{genetic map}} of the <b>variola</b> major <b>virus</b> strain India- 1967 is built basing on the sequence data. The suggested map is compared with the maps of the sequenced genomic regions of Copenhagen and Western Reserve strains of vaccinia virus and Harvey strain of <b>variola</b> major <b>virus.</b> The principle differences revealed in the genomic organization of these viruses are discussed...|$|R
50|$|A Bayesian {{study of}} Orthopox genomes {{suggests}} that the unclassified Yoka poxvirus diverged from the lineage {{that gave rise to}} the orthopoxviruses ~90,000 years ago. The orthopox viruses diverged from the other pox viruses about 10,000 yeara ago. Camelpox, taterapox and <b>variola</b> <b>viruses</b> arose 3,500 years ago and horsepox virus ~3,000. These viruses may have arise in these viruses first emerged in the region of the Horn of Africa.|$|R
5|$|There {{were two}} {{clinical}} forms of smallpox. Variola major was the severe and most common form, {{with a more}} extensive rash and higher fever. Variola minor was a less common presentation, and a much less severe disease, with historical death rates of 1 percent or less. Subclinical (asymptomatic) infections with <b>variola</b> <b>virus</b> were noted but were not common. In addition, a form called variola sine eruptione (smallpox without rash) was seen generally in vaccinated persons. This form was marked by a fever that occurred after the usual incubation period and could be confirmed only by antibody studies or, rarely, by virus isolation.|$|E
5|$|The overall case-fatality {{rate for}} ordinary-type {{smallpox}} is about 30 percent, but varies by pock distribution: ordinary type-confluent is fatal about 50–75 {{percent of the}} time, ordinary-type semi-confluent about 25–50 percent of the time, {{in cases where the}} rash is discrete the case-fatality rate is less than 10 percent. The overall fatality rate for children younger than 1 year of age is 40–50 percent. Hemorrhagic and flat types have the highest fatality rates. The fatality rate for flat-type is 90 percent or greater and nearly 100 percent is observed in cases of hemorrhagic smallpox. The case-fatality rate for variola minor is 1 percent or less. There is no evidence of chronic or recurrent infection with <b>variola</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Transmission occurs through {{inhalation}} {{of airborne}} <b>variola</b> <b>virus,</b> usually droplets expressed from the oral, nasal, or pharyngeal mucosa of an infected person. It {{is transmitted from}} one person to another primarily through prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person, usually within a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m), but can also be spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated objects (fomites) such as bedding or clothing. Rarely, smallpox has been spread by virus carried in the air in enclosed settings such as buildings, buses, and trains. The virus can cross the placenta, but the incidence of congenital smallpox is relatively low.|$|E
50|$|Four genera of poxviruses may infect humans: orthopoxvirus, parapoxvirus, yatapoxvirus, molluscipoxvirus.Orthopox: {{smallpox}} <b>virus</b> (<b>variola),</b> vaccinia <b>virus,</b> cowpox virus, monkeypox virus;Parapox: orf virus, pseudocowpox, {{bovine papular stomatitis}} virus;Yatapox: tanapox virus, yaba monkey tumor virus;Molluscipox: {{molluscum contagiosum}} virus (MCV).The most common are vaccinia (seen on Indian subcontinent) and molluscum contagiosum, but monkeypox infections are rising (seen in west and central African rainforest countries).|$|R
40|$|Poxviruses encode {{multiple}} {{proteins that}} {{enable them to}} evade host responses. Among these are serine protease inhibitors (serpins). One of the earliest serpins described, cowpox virus crmA, acts to inhibit inflammation and apoptosis. crmA homo-logous serpins, known as SPI- 2, are conserved in rabbitpox, vaccinia and <b>variola</b> <b>viruses.</b> Here, we describe the characterization of ectromelia virus (EV) SPI- 2. EV SPI- 2 encodes a protein of approxi-mately 38 kDa showing S 94 % identity with other poxviral homologues. Conservative changes in amino acid sequence were found within the reactive site loop and the serpin backbone. Like crmA, transient expression of SPI- 2 protected cells from tumour necrosis factor-mediated apoptosis an...|$|R
40|$|White pock {{variants}} of cowpox virus give papular lesions on intradermal inoculation of rabbits, without the necrosis and haemorrhage that {{are produced by}} wild type cowpox viruses. Rondle & Dumbell (1962) have shown that white pock {{variants of}} cowpox virus fail to produce a specific, precipitating antigen which they called 'd' substance. In this paper it is shown that 'd' is demonstrable in soluble antigen preparations of rabbitpox virus and of neurovirulent strains of vaccinia virus but not in soluble antigens of <b>variola</b> <b>viruses.</b> Two series of recombinant viruses prepared by Dumbell & Bedson (1964) from variola and cowpox and from <b>variola</b> and rabbitpox <b>viruses</b> were tested {{for the production of}} 'd' substance. These results were compared with the previously recorded effects of these recombinants when inoculated intradermally in rabbits. It is concluded that functional genes determining the production of 'd' and of rabbit skin pathogenicity are closely linked on the pox virus genome, but that there is insufficient evidence to say that the two functions are interdependent...|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} procedure used {{to prevent}} smallpox was inoculation (known as variolation after the introduction of smallpox vaccine to avoid possible confusion), which likely occurred in India, Africa, and China well before the practice arrived in Europe. However, the idea that inoculation originated in India has been challenged, as few of the ancient Sanskrit medical texts described the process of inoculation. Accounts of inoculation against smallpox in China can be found {{as early as the}} late 10th century, and the procedure was widely practiced by the 16th century, during the Ming dynasty. If successful, inoculation produced lasting immunity to smallpox. However, because the person was infected with <b>variola</b> <b>virus,</b> a severe infection could result, and the person could transmit smallpox to others. Variolation had a 0.5–2 percent mortality rate, considerably less than the 20–30 percent mortality rate of the disease. Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers.|$|E
25|$|Publication of the Inquiry and the {{subsequent}} energetic promulgation by Jenner {{of the idea of}} vaccination with a virus other than <b>variola</b> <b>virus</b> constituted a watershed in the control of smallpox for which he, more than anyone else deserves the credit.|$|E
25|$|After Henderson left WHO in 1976 or 1977, Arita went on {{to direct}} the unit. Under his {{leadership}} an outbreak of variola minor in the Horn of Africa during the Ethiopian–Somali war was successfully contained, and the final case of naturally transmitted smallpox occurred in October 1977. He administered {{the process by which}} smallpox was formally certified by WHO as having been eradicated globally in May 1980. After certification, he managed the implementation of the certifying commission's recommendations. He continued to direct the unit's international surveillance activities. He was also involved in formulating policies on issues including ongoing vaccination and laboratory stocks of <b>variola</b> <b>virus,</b> and in archiving WHO's data on the eradication programme. In 1999, he was one of several scientists to argue for the destruction of the remaining stocks of <b>variola</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|E
40|$|The growth characteristics, {{including}} ceiling temperatures for growth, {{of three}} strains of monkeypox virus were studied on chick chorioallantoic membrane, growth and plaque formation were studied in RK 13 cells, and growth was studied in rabbit dermis. The three strains {{could not be}} distinguished by these tests but could be differentiated from variola, vaccinia, and cowpox viruses. Haemagglutination-inhibition tests with homologous and heterologous antisera also showed that the monkeypox strains were indistinguishable, although they could be differentiated from vaccinia and cowpox, but not from <b>variola,</b> <b>viruses.</b> Similar results were obtained in neutralization tests. It is suggested that the monkeypox strains constitute a homogeneous poxvirus entity. The strains can be differentiated from other poxviruses by their cultural characteristics but serologically they are {{more closely related to}} variola than to vaccinia or cowpox viruses...|$|R
40|$|In view {{of earlier}} work which {{suggested}} that certain derivatives of isatin β-thiosemicarbazone {{might be of}} possible clinical use in smallpox infections, several such derivatives have been tested for antiviral effect in infant mice inoculated intracerebrally with up to 103 LD 50 (up to 106. 5 pock-forming units) of the Harvey strain of <b>variola</b> major <b>virus...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{spread of}} {{infectious}} agents {{through the mail}} has concerned public health officials for 5 centuries. The dissemination of anthrax spores in the US mail in 2001 was a recent example. In 1901, two medical journals reported outbreaks of smallpox presumably introduced by letters contaminated with <b>variola</b> <b>viruses.</b> The stability and infectivity of the smallpox virus are reviewed from both a historical (anecdotal) perspective and modern virologic studies. Bubonic plague was the contagious disease that led to quarantines {{as early as the}} 14 th century in port cities in southern Europe. Later, smallpox, cholera, typhus, and yellow fever were recognized as also warranting quarantine measures. Initially, attempts were made to decontaminate all goods imported from pestilential areas, particularly mail. Disinfection of mail was largely abandoned in the early 20 th century with newer knowledge about the spread and stability of these 5 infectious agents...|$|R
25|$|Vaccinia {{virus is}} closely related to <b>variola</b> <b>virus,</b> which is known to cause the {{smallpox}} disease. The vaccinia virus {{has been shown to be}} able to bind to sulfatide through the L5 and A27 membrane proteins on the virus. It has been demonstrated in mouse models that sulfatide prevents the attachment of vaccinia virus to the cell’s surface, while also preventing death in mouse models that are typically lethal. This suggests that sulfatide may be one receptor for the vaccinia virus.|$|E

Many viral agents have been studied and/or weaponized, {{including some of the}} Bunyaviridae (especially Rift Valley fever virus), Ebolavirus, many of the Flaviviridae (especially Japanese encephalitis virus), Machupo virus, Marburg virus, <b>Variola</b> <b>virus,</b> and Yellow fever virus.

25|$|Smallpox is a {{contagious}} disease {{caused by the}} <b>variola</b> <b>virus.</b> The disease killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans per year during the closing years of the 18th century. During the 20th century, {{it is estimated that}} smallpox was responsible for 300–500 million deaths. As recently as the early 1950s, an estimated 50 million cases of smallpox occurred in the world each year. After successful vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the WHO certified the eradication of smallpox in December 1979. To this day, smallpox is the only human infectious disease to have been completely eradicated, and one of two infectious viruses ever to be eradicated.|$|E
40|$|Proteins harbor domains {{or short}} linear motifs, which {{facilitate}} their functions and interactions. Finding functional motifs in protein sequences could predict the putative cellular roles or characteristics of hypothetical proteins. In this study, we present Shetti-Motif, {{which is an}} interactive tool to (i) map UniProt and PROSITE flat files, (ii) search for multiple pre-defined consensus patterns or experimentally validated functional motifs in large datasets protein sequences (proteome-wide), (iii) search for motifs containing repeated residues (low-complexity regions, e. g., Leu-, SR-, PEST-rich motifs, etc.). As proof of principle, using this comparative proteomics pipeline, eleven proteomes encoded by member of Poxviridae family were searched against about 100 experimentally validated functional motifs. The closely related viruses and viruses infect the same host cells (e. g. vaccinia and <b>variola</b> <b>viruses)</b> show similar motif-containing proteins profile. The motifs encoded by these viruses are correlated, which explains why poxviruses are able to interact with wide range of host cells. In conclusion, this in silico analysis is useful to establish a dataset(s) or potential proteins for further investigation or compare between species...|$|R
40|$|Clinical and {{pathologic}} {{studies of}} patients with smallpox suggest that conductive hearing loss is a frequent complication of smallpox {{and that it is}} due to otitis media. A possible experimental model for this hearing loss has been developed by study of the pathogenesis of acute vaccinia virus infections of hamster middle ears. Infant hamsters developed severe necrotic otitis media, and vaccinia viral antigen was demo onstrated by fluorescent antibody staining in large confluent areas of epithelial cells lining the middle ear. Juvenile hamsters developed a patchy, less severe infection of the middle ear, most of which was present along the tympanic membrane and mid-dle ear ossicles. Adult hamsters did not develop middle ear infection. These findings support the argument that <b>variola</b> (smallpox) <b>virus</b> can cause otitis media in humans and that viral infection of the middle ear may be the cause of hearing loss. Infection with <b>variola</b> (smallpox) <b>virus</b> results in considerable mortality and morbidity, and hearing loss is common in survivors [I, 2].

25|$|Biosafety-level-4 {{laboratories}} {{are used}} for diagnostic work and research on easily transmitted pathogens which can cause fatal disease. These include a number of viruses known to cause viral hemorrhagic fever such as Marburg virus, Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Other pathogens handled at BSL-4 include Hendra virus, Nipah virus, and some Flaviviruses. Additionally, poorly characterized pathogens which appear closely related to dangerous pathogens are often handled at this level until sufficient data are obtained either to confirm continued work at this level, or {{to work with them}} at a lower level. This level is also used for work with <b>Variola</b> <b>virus,</b> the causative agent of smallpox, though this work can only be done at the World Health Organization approved facilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, U.S.A., as well as the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology in Koltsovo, Russia.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{inoculation}} {{is often}} used interchangeably with vaccination. However, some argue that the terms are not synonymous. Dr Byron Plant explains: [...] "Vaccination is the more commonly used term, which actually consists of a 'safe' injection of a sample taken from a cow suffering from cowpox... Inoculation, a practice probably {{as old as the}} disease itself, is the injection of the <b>variola</b> <b>virus</b> taken from a pustule or scab of a smallpox sufferer into the superficial layers of the skin, commonly on the upper arm of the subject.

40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of a special study to determine whether variola-like “whitepox” viruses could arise as white pock variants of monkeypox virus after {{one or a few}} mutations.

40|$|AbstractAlastrim <b>variola</b> minor <b>virus,</b> {{which causes}} mild smallpox, was first {{recognized}} in Florida and South America {{in the late}} 19 th century. Genome linear double-stranded DNA sequences (186, 986 bp) of the alastrim virus Garcia- 1966, a laboratory reference strain from an outbreak associated with 0. 8 % case fatalities in Brazil in 1966, were determined except for a 530 -bp fragment of hairpin-loop sequences at each terminus. The DNA sequences (EMBL Accession No. Y 16780) showed 206 potential open reading frames for proteins containing ≥ 60 amino acids. The amino acid sequences of the putative proteins were compared with those reported for vaccinia virus strain Copenhagen and the Asian variola major strains India- 1967 and Bangladesh- 1975. About one-third of the alastrim viral proteins were 100 % identical to correlates in the variola major strains and the remainder were ≥ 95 % identical. Compared with <b>variola</b> major <b>virus</b> DNA, alastrim virus DNA has additional segments of 898 and 627 bp, respectively, within {{the left and right}} terminal regions.

2500|$|Two {{forms of}} the disease of {{smallpox}} were recognised, now known {{to be due to}} two strains of the <b>Variola</b> <b>virus.</b> [...] Those contracting Variola minor had a greatly reduced risk of death – 1–2% – compared to those contracting Variola major with 30% mortality. [...] Infection via inhaled viral particles in droplets spread the infection more widely than the deliberate infection through a small skin wound. [...] The smaller, localised infection is adequate to stimulate the immune system to produce specific immunity to the virus, while requiring more generations of the virus to reach levels of infection likely to kill the patient. [...] The rising immunity terminates the infection. [...] So the twofold effect is to ensure the less fatal form of the disease is the one caught, and to give the immune system [...] the best start possible in combating it.|$|E

40|$|NF-κB {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements that coordinate stress-induced, immune, and inflammatory responses. Myxoma virus, a member of the Poxviridae family responsible for rabbit myxomatosis, codes for several factors that help its survival in the host. In this study, we focused on the product of the M 150 R gene. We show that the protein has nine ankyrin repeats (ANKs), with the eighth having a close similarity with the nuclear localization signal-containing ANK of I-κBα, which regulates NF-κB activity by sequestering it in the cytosol. Because the viral protein is targeted to the nucleus, it was named MNF, for myxoma nuclear factor. This localization was lost when the eighth ANK was removed. In tumor necrosis factor alpha-treated cells, MNF and NF-κB colocalized as dotted spots in the nucleus. In vivo experiments with a knockout virus showed that MNF is a critical virulence factor, with its deletion generating an almost apathogenic virus. Detailed histological examinations revealed an increase in the inflammatory process in the absence of MNF, consistent with the interference of MNF with the NF-κB-induced proinflammatory pathway. Because MNF has homologs in other poxviruses, such as vaccinia, cowpox, and <b>variola</b> <b>viruses,</b> this protein is probably part of a key mechanism that contributes to the immunogenic and pathogenic properties of these viruses...|$|R
40|$|Immunization with {{vaccinia virus}} results in {{long-lasting}} protection against smallpox {{and is an}} approach that has been successfully used to eliminate natural smallpox infections worldwide. Today, vaccinia virus is very important {{not only as a}} vaccine virus to protect human against smallpox, but also as an expression vector for immunization against other infectious diseases, such as HIV and cancer. In this article, we identify three new vaccinia human CD 8 + T-cell epitopes conserved among vaccinia and <b>variola</b> <b>viruses</b> restricted by HLA-A 2, HLA-B 7, or HLA-B* 3502, which belongs to the HLA-B 7 supertype.

40|$|T cells play an {{essential}} role in the process of recovery from primary infection of mice with ectromelia virus, a poxvirus related to vaccinia and <b>variola</b> <b>viruses</b> (1 - 4), but the precise mechanisms involved and the participation of different effector T-cell subsets and ancillary cells remain to be fully elucidated. Massive liver necrosis is the major cause of death (1 - 3). Recovery therefore depends upon control of virus replication and spread in progressing lesions of the liver parenchyma and upon control of infection in other tissues, such as spleen, which may contribute to the cell-associated viremia (1) which in turn may initiate new liver lesions. A number of potential mechanisms of recovery could be supplied by effector T cells. First, cytotoxic T cells could kill virus-infected cells before they support virus replication, thus halting virus spread; this is feasible since ectromelia-infected cells display antigenic changes recognized by cytotoxic T cells long before progeny virus is assembled (5). Second, recognition of foci of infection by effector T cells leads to recruitment (2, 3, 6) and activation (7) of mononuclear phagocytes which destroy virus-infected material (3). Third, effector T cells may secrete interferon at sites of infection, thus protecting othe...|$|R
