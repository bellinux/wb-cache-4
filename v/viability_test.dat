40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} a commercial-level field-portable lens-free cell analyzer called the NaviCell (No-stain and Automated Versatile Innovative cell analyzer) capable of automatically analyzing cell count and viability without employing an optical microscope and reagents. Based on the lens-free shadow imaging technique, the NaviCell (162 × 135 × 138 mm 3 and 1. 02 kg) {{has the advantage}} of providing analysis results with improved standard deviation between measurement results, owing to its large field of view. Importantly, the cell counting and <b>viability</b> <b>testing</b> can be analyzed without the use of any reagent, thereby simplifying the measurement procedure and reducing potential errors during sample preparation. In this study, the performance of the NaviCell for cell counting and <b>viability</b> <b>testing</b> was demonstrated using 13 and six cell lines, respectively. Based on the results of the hemocytometer (de facto standard), the error rate (ER) and coefficient of variation (CV) of the NaviCell are approximately 3. 27 and 2. 16 times better than the commercial cell counter, respectively. The cell <b>viability</b> <b>testing</b> of the NaviCell also showed an ER and CV performance improvement of 5. 09 and 1. 8 times, respectively, demonstrating sufficient potential in the field of cell analysis...|$|R
50|$|A {{fluorescein}} diacetate (FDA) biochemical <b>viability</b> <b>test</b> {{for several}} species of conifer seed, including white spruce, estimates the proportion of live seed (viability) in a seedlot, and hence the percentage germination of a seedlot. The accuracy of predicting percentage germination was within +/- 5 for most seedlots. White spruce seed can be tested for viability by an indirect method, such as the fluorescein diacetate (FDA) test or ‘Ultra-sound'; or by the direct growth method of ‘germination'. Samples of white spruce seed inspected by Toumey and Stevens (1928) varied in viability from 50% to 100%, but averaged 93%. Rafn (1915) reported 97% viability for white spruce seed.|$|E

40|$|Genebank {{managers}} conduct <b>viability</b> <b>tests</b> on stored seeds so {{they can}} replace lots that have viability near a critical threshold, such as 50 or 85 % germination. Currently, these tests are typically scheduled at uniform intervals; testing every 5 years is common. A manager needs to balance {{the cost of an}} additional test against the possibility of losing a seed lot due to late retesting. We developed a data-informed method to schedule <b>viability</b> <b>tests</b> for a collection of 2, 833 maize seed lots with 3 to 7 completed <b>viability</b> <b>tests</b> per lot. Given these historical data reporting on seed viability at arbitrary times, we fit a hierarchical Bayesian seed-viability model with random seed lot specific coefficients. The posterior distribution of the predicted time to cross below a critical threshold was estimated for each seed lot. We recommend a predicted quantile as a retest time, chosen to balance the importance of catching quickly decaying lots against the cost of premature tests. The method can be used with any seed-viability model; we focused on two, the Avrami viability curve and a quadratic curve that accounts for seed after-ripening. After fitting both models, we found that the quadratic curve gave more plausible predictions than did the Avrami curve. Also, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and a follow-up test demonstrated that a 0. 05 quantile yields reasonable predictions...|$|R

40|$|A reform <b>viability</b> <b>test</b> of Van Heerden is {{utilised}} {{to assess}} the viability of implementing case management to address perceived delay experienced in the South African civil procedural regime. The reform <b>viability</b> <b>test</b> holds {{that in order for}} any attempt at reform to be successful, a reform-ethos, being the ideal to which reforms strives, must be identified and said identified reform-ethos must be in line with the reform-need experience by a civil procedural regime. The three elements of the reform <b>viability</b> <b>test</b> of: (i) the reform-need (demarcated in this study to the need to address delay); (ii) the reform-ethos (identified herein as the implicit constitutional right to access to justice) and (iii) the reform options to address delay (the options explored herein being judicial resource approach, delay reductive innovations and case management) are evaluated. The last-mentioned option is investigated with reference to examples of both comprehensive case management regimes (as are evident in English civil procedure and the Federal Court of Australia) and selective case management regimes (as are evident in certain Australian states and territories).

40|$|Objective: The {{viability}} assessment in hydatid cyst {{is important for}} both in vitro and in vivo studies, and also in drug experiments. Several vital and avital stains as neutral red, methylene blue, eosin, Papanicolao, Giemsa, Ziehl-Neelsen, toluidine blue and trypan blue {{have been used to}} assess viability of protoscoleces in fertile cysts. Of them, eosin is the most widely preferred stain. Various concentrations of eosin have been used in the dying procedures. In this study, it was aimed to determine the ideal concentration of eosin for assessing protoscolex fertility. Method: Protoscoleces were treated with eosin concentrations: 0. 05 %, 0. 1 %, 1 %, 3 %, and 5 %. A total of 500 protoscoleces were examined by eosin staining techniques with 0., 5., 15., 30. and 60. -minute intervals. Results: Ideal concentrations of eosin which will be used for <b>viability</b> <b>test</b> to determine the motile flame cells and contractile protoscolex were found as 0. 1 % and 1 %. In <b>viability</b> <b>test</b> of protoscolex, above the 1 % concentration of eosin caused difficulty in the decision of viability because of the darker background. On the otherhand, at lower concentrations of eosin less than 0. 1 %, despite no flame cells motility and protoscolex contractility, dead protoscolex would be misidentified as “ alive”. Conclusion: Eosin is a dye which is cheap, less toxic, easily prepared and available at anywhere. Because of those properties, it is prefered for the <b>viability</b> <b>test</b> of protoscolex and is recommended to use between 0. 1 % and 1 % concentrations for the ideal staining to viability determination...|$|E

For the viability assay, three different concentrations of RE solubles (0.5, 1 and 5  mM) in DMEM+FBS (A 549, SW 837) and RPMI+FBS (MCF 7) were used. The initial number of cells seeded in the 96 -well plates was ~[*] 5 [*]×[*] 104 cells/well.
