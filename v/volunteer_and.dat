5|$|The Dutch Navy {{would need}} a {{significant}} manpower expansion of 2,800 sailors to crew all of the proposed battleships. The Commission {{believed that it was}} unlikely that sufficient Dutch citizens would <b>volunteer,</b> <b>and</b> that as a result Indonesian sailors should be recruited and trained for service in the NEI. Strong segregation between white and Indonesian sailors was to be maintained to the maximum extent practical for unit efficiency.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Ripken, {{along with}} Andre Agassi, Muhammad Ali, Lance Armstrong, Warrick Dunn, Mia Hamm, Jeff Gordon, Tony Hawk, Andrea Jaeger, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Mario Lemieux, and Alonzo Mourning founded , a {{charitable}} organization, which helps professional athletes {{get involved in}} charitable causes and inspires millions of non-athletes to <b>volunteer</b> <b>and</b> support the community.

30|$|The September Supplements {{include a}} series of {{questions}} regarding (formal) <b>volunteering</b> activities <b>and</b> choices. As a caveat, employing formal, rather than informal volunteering, will, if anything, understate the relationship between <b>volunteering</b> <b>and</b> immigration due to the lower correlation between formal <b>volunteering</b> <b>and</b> social cohesion (Tong 2010; Letki 2008), so that measured relationships between <b>volunteering</b> <b>and</b> immigration may actually be even stronger than found in the current analysis.|$|R

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis titled "Pro-Social Behaviour of <b>Volunteers</b> addresses <b>volunteering</b> <b>and</b> <b>volunteers,</b> <b>and</b> compares {{differences in}} pro-social behaviour of <b>volunteers</b> <b>and</b> the common population. The research verified two hypotheses: 1. Volunteers show {{a higher level}} of pro-social tendencies and behaviour than people without any volunteering experience. 2. Long-term volunteers show {{a higher level of}} pro-social behaviour and tendencies than people having short-term volunteering experience. Both the hypotheses have been confirmed...|$|R
5|$|The Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that {{reformed}} {{the auxiliary}} {{forces of the}} British Army by transferring existing <b>Volunteer</b> <b>and</b> Yeomanry units into a new Territorial Force (TF); and disbanding the Militia {{to form a new}} Special Reserve of the Regular Army. This reorganisation formed {{a major part of the}} Haldane Reforms, named after the creator of the Act, Richard Haldane.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) orders Darryl to hire {{replacements}} for the warehouse staff, but Darryl is wallowing in his depression and neglects to {{even look at}} the applications. With an order due out for one of Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) most important clients, Andy asks for volunteers to step in {{for the day and}} make sure that the order is shipped out. Jim, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) take over the process, (however, in a talking-head interview, Kevin states that he will deliberately do a poor job because he did not <b>volunteer</b> <b>and</b> was merely suggested for the job because of his large size), but {{do not know how to}} use the heavy-lifting equipment and balk at the notion of carrying all the heavy boxes by hand. Upon Kevin's suggestion, they create an oil luge to slide the boxes across the floor resulting in a lot of damaged inventory. They retool Kevin's idea throughout the day, resulting in still more damaged inventory, and Phyllis ultimately loses the client.|$|E
5|$|In October 1939, {{conscription}} {{was introduced}} to keep the Militia at strength as its members volunteered for the AIF. From January 1940, all unmarried men turning 21 were required to report to be examined for potential service. While a substantial proportion of these men were granted exemptions on medical grounds or because they would suffer financial hardship if forced to enter the military, the remainder were liable for three months training followed by ongoing reserve service. A side effect of this arrangement {{was the creation of}} two different armies with different conditions of service, one the part-volunteer part-conscript Militia and the other the all-volunteer AIF. This situation resulted in administrative and structural problems that existed throughout the war, as well as a sometimes bitter professional rivalry between the men of the two forces. Later, provision was made to allow Militia units to transfer to the AIF if sufficient numbers of personnel volunteered to serve under AIF terms of service. This required 65 percent of a unit's war establishment—or 75 percent of its actual strength—to <b>volunteer</b> <b>and</b> allowed whole battalions {{to become part of the}} AIF.|$|E

5|$|In late 2008, Aamer Ahmed Khan of the BBC Urdu {{website and}} his colleagues {{came up with a}} novel way of {{covering}} the Taliban's growing influence in Swat. They decided to ask a schoolgirl to blog anonymously about her life there. Their correspondent in Peshawar, Abdul Hai Kakar, had been in touch with a local school teacher, Ziauddin Yousafzai, but could not find any students willing to do so, as it was considered too dangerous by their families. Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11-year-old Malala. At the time, Taliban militants led by Maulana Fazlullah were taking over the Swat Valley, banning television, music, girls' education, and women from going shopping. Bodies of beheaded policemen were being displayed in town squares. At first, a girl named Aisha from her father's school agreed to write a diary, but then the girl's parents stopped her from doing it because they feared Taliban reprisals. The only alternative was Yousafzai, four years younger than the original <b>volunteer,</b> <b>and</b> in seventh grade at the time. Editors at the BBC unanimously agreed.|$|E
5|$|Texas A {{provides}} {{many opportunities}} for students to participate in <b>volunteer</b> <b>and</b> service activities. Students at Texas A originated The Big Event, the largest one-day student-run service project in the nation. The annual event began in 1983 after the Texas A Student Government Association passed a resolution encouraging students to show their gratitude to the community by giving of their time. From its beginnings of sixindividual students wanting to contribute back to the local community, The Big Event has expanded to allow over twenty-two thousand students to participate in over 2500jobs, such as raking leaves, painting houses, and trimming trees. The concept for The Big Event has spread throughout the nation, and as of 2015, 110 schools across the nation participate each year including 1middle school, 2high schools, and 68universities. The 2008 Big Event attracted 10,600 students who worked a record number of 1,000 jobs.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, on {{receiving}} her diploma, de Bourgoing {{joined the}} Société de Secours aux Blessés Militaires (SSBM), forerunner of the French Red Cross, as a <b>volunteer</b> <b>and</b> began {{working at the}} Beaujon Hospital in Paris. As {{a result of her}} competence and the understanding she showed both patients and doctors, she was appointed president of the SSBM. In 1907, she sailed for Morocco with the French expeditionary force under General Antoine Marius Benoît Drude. As head of a team of SSBM volunteers, she established an infirmary in Casablanca, treating the wounded in the conflicts between the French and Moroccans. As conditions were difficult in Morocco, it was decided the wounded and seriously ill should be transported to Oran in Algeria where {{it would be easier to}} provide proper treatment. It was in October 1907 while she and two of her nurses were accompanying the wounded on a French naval crossing to Oran, that she first met General Hubert Lyautey, who was division commander there. After spending fifteen months in North Africa, she returned to France, only to leave shortly afterwards for the Italian port Messina in December where she and her nursing team helped care for the 80,000 victims of the 1908 earthquake. As a result of their exemplary services, they were decorated by Princess Hélène of Orléans.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examines}} {{the relevance of}} two theoretical approaches, socio-structural resources theory and the functional analysis of behaviour theory, to understand volunteer behaviour of older adults. The aims {{of this study were}} to ascertain whether volunteering is associated with greater wellbeing in older Australians; to identify whether <b>volunteers</b> <b>and</b> non-volunteers differ in their socio-structural resources; to explore older adults&# 039; motivations for <b>volunteering,</b> <b>and</b> to investigate the relationship between motivation and connectedness, incorporating perceived appreciation and respect by the organisation and the community. For this purpose, 140 individuals (91 female and 49 males) aged 55 years and over participated in the study. Of this number 85 were <b>volunteers</b> <b>and</b> 55 were non-volunteers. Contrary to our prediction, wellbeing did not differ between <b>volunteers</b> <b>and</b> non-volunteers. The relationship status was the only socio-structural variable found to differ between <b>volunteers</b> <b>and</b> non-volunteers, with <b>volunteers</b> more likely to be single than in an intimate relationship. As predicted, the most important motivation for volunteering was to express personal values while the least important motivation was to gain career-related experience. Also as predicted, a positive relationship was noted between the value motive for <b>volunteering</b> <b>and</b> connectedness. The implications of understanding motives for volunteering for the recruitment and retention of older adults are discussed...|$|R
