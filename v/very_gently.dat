5|$|Zion National Park {{includes}} an elevated plateau {{that consists of}} sedimentary formations that dip <b>very</b> <b>gently</b> to the east. This means that the oldest strata are exposed along the Virgin River in the Zion Canyon part of the park, and the youngest are exposed in the Kolob Canyons section. The plateau is bounded on the east by the Sevier Fault Zone, and on the west by the Hurricane Fault Zone. Weathering and erosion along north-trending faults and fractures influence the formation of landscape features, such as canyons, in this region.|$|E
5|$|Heavily {{built and}} {{characteristically}} smooth, the pectoral fin disc of the short-tail stingray has a rather angular, rhomboid shape and is slightly wider than long. The leading {{margins of the}} disc are <b>very</b> <b>gently</b> convex, and converge on a blunt, broadly triangular snout. The eyes are small and immediately followed by much larger spiracles. The widely spaced nostrils are long and narrow; between them is a short, skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a fringed posterior margin. The modestly sized mouth has an evenly arched lower jaw, prominent grooves at the corners, and 5–7 papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor. Additional, tiny papillae are scattered on the nasal curtain and outside the lower jaw. The teeth are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces; each tooth is small and blunt, with a roughly diamond-shaped base. There are 45–55 tooth rows in either jaw. The pelvic fins are somewhat large and rounded at the tips.|$|E
6000|$|The {{letter was}} <b>very</b> dignified, <b>gently</b> reproachful, for Daisy had {{undoubtedly}} committed certain peccadilloes, {{although she was}} going to be a baronet's wife; but still it was completely forgiving, and Mrs Griffith signed herself, 'Your loving and forgiving mother, whose heart you nearly broke.' ...|$|R

25|$|The {{church is}} located at the {{southwest}} corner of the intersection a few blocks north of downtown Albany. The terrain slopes <b>very</b> <b>gently</b> towards the Hudson River 1,000ft (300 m) to the east, and more sharply upwards to the southwest and northwest, reflecting the ravine that gave the nearby Sheridan Hollow neighborhood its name. Open space begins to break up the urban fabric here, in contrast to the denser development of downtown.|$|E
25|$|Once the yerba mate has settled, {{the mate}} is {{carefully}} {{brought to a}} near-sideways angle, with the opening tilted just slightly upward of the base. The mate is then shaken <b>very</b> <b>gently</b> with a side-to-side motion. This further settles the yerba mate inside the gourd so that the finest particles move toward the opening and the yerba is layered along one side. The largest stems and other bits create a partition between the empty space {{on one side of}} the gourd and the lopsided pile of yerba on the other.|$|E
25|$|<b>Very</b> <b>gently</b> {{massaging}} {{the area}} and applying heat may encourage blood flow and relieve pain according to the gate control theory of pain, although causing additional pain may indicate the massage is exacerbating the injury. As for most injuries, these techniques should not be applied until {{at least three days}} following the initial damage to ensure all internal bleeding has stopped, because although increasing blood flow will allow more healing factors into {{the area and}} encourage drainage, if the injury is still bleeding this will allow more blood to seep out of the wound and cause the bruise to become worse.|$|E

25|$|This {{species is}} {{particularly}} revered {{in the traditional}} religion of the Igbo people of southeastern Nigeria. It is considered symbolic of the earth, being an animal that travels {{so close to the}} ground. Even among many Christian Igbos, these pythons are treated with great care whenever they happen to wander into a village or onto someone's property; they are allowed to roam freely or are <b>very</b> <b>gently</b> picked up and placed out in a forest or field away from any homes. If one is accidentally killed, many communities in Igboland still build a coffin for the snake's remains and give it a short funeral.|$|E
25|$|Screening the fibre {{involves}} using a mesh {{made from}} non-corroding and inert material, such as aluminium, which is stretched {{in a wooden}} frame {{similar to that of}} a window. The size of the paper is governed {{by the size of the}} frame. This tool is then completely submerged in the solution vertically and drawn out horizontally to ensure a uniform coating of the wire mesh. Excess water is then removed and the wet mat of fibre laid on top of a damp cloth. The process is repeated for the required number of sheets. This stack of wet mats is then pressed in a hydraulic press <b>very</b> <b>gently</b> to ensure the fibre does not squeeze out. The fairly damp fibre is then dried using a variety of methods, such as vacuum drying or simply air drying. Sometimes, the individual sheet is rolled to flatten, harden, and refine the surface. Finally, the paper is then cut to the desired shape or the standard shape (A4, letter, legal, etc.) and packed.|$|E

40|$|We present {{longitudinal}} and dipole wakefield {{simulations of}} TESLA and NLC collimator designs using a newly de-veloped numerical algorithm, one {{that allows for}} the accurate calculation of the combination of very short bunches and <b>very</b> long, <b>gently</b> tapered structures. We demonstrate that the new algorithm is superior to the standard method of such calculations. For small taper angles our results agree with analytical formulas of Yokoya. In addition, we optimize the TESLA TTF 2 ”step+taper ” collimator design, and compare with collimator test measurements carried out at SLAC...|$|R

500|$|We {{have found}} these fish {{when they were}} {{too small to be}} worth cooking in the usual way, {{excellent}} when quite simply baked in the following manner, the flesh being remarkably sweet and tender, much more so than it becomes by frying or broiling. After they have been cleaned, dry them in a cloth, season the insides slightly with fine salt, dredge a little flour on the fish, and stick a few very small bits of butter on them, but only just sufficient to prevent their becoming dry in the oven; lay them singly on a flat dish, and bake them <b>very</b> <b>gently</b> from fourteen to sixteen minutes. Serve them with the same sauce as baked soles.|$|E
500|$|Britten {{was at the}} RCM from 1930 to 1933, {{studying}} composition with Ireland {{and piano}} with Arthur Benjamin. He won the Sullivan Prize for composition, the Cobbett Prize for chamber music, and was twice winner of the Ernest Farrar Prize for composition. Despite these honours, he was not greatly impressed by the establishment: he found his fellow-students [...] "amateurish and folksy" [...] and the staff [...] "inclined to suspect technical brilliance of being superficial and insincere". Another Ireland pupil, the composer Humphrey Searle, said that Ireland could be [...] "an inspiring teacher to those on his own wavelength"; Britten was not, and learned little from him. He continued to study privately with Bridge, although he later praised Ireland for [...] "nurs me <b>very</b> <b>gently</b> through a very, very difficult musical adolescence".|$|E
500|$|... "From the Ages" [...] was {{recorded}} for the band's live album Live at Roadburn {{five years before}} and, being very long, was described by Rubalcaba as [...] "a bastard to play [...] ". The band wanted to record it in as few takes as possible {{in spite of its}} length, which they addressed by recording the song in Pro Tools as they expected it could be up to forty minutes long; in the past they used analog tape which only allowed for about twenty minutes of music but, according to Rubalcaba, yielded the best recording quality. Earthless rehearsed [...] "From the Ages" [...] for three days before recording it in about three takes. In the last five minutes of the song, the band <b>very</b> <b>gently</b> ease into the end, to avoid having to end the song abruptly. Although he had said the same of [...] "Violence of the Red Sea" [...] with respect to the album itself in a previous interview, Rubalcaba later described [...] "From the Ages" [...] as the most organized, planned song the band had yet ever recorded, let alone recorded for this album. He described the mixture of influences in the song as [...] "A supreme psycho-delic buffet served up with all the sour Kraut, all the freshest sushi Japan has to offer & what not". Rubalcaba reiterated the [...] "pre-historic, caveman, dry & mysterious wasteland feel" [...] that inspired the title. The song expanded constantly during rehearsals and evolved after its debut on Live at Roadburn.|$|E

2500|$|Being {{a shield}} volcano, Olympus Mons has a <b>very</b> <b>gently</b> sloping profile. The average slope on the volcano's flanks is only 5°. Slopes are highest {{near the middle}} part of the flanks and grow {{shallower}} toward the base, giving the flanks a concave upward profile. The shape of Olympus Mons is distinctly asymmetrical. Its flanks are shallower and extend farther from the summit in the northwestern direction than they do to the southeast. The volcano's shape and profile have been likened to a [...] "circus tent" [...] held up by a single pole that is shifted off center.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the cradle}} cap is not severe, it could simply be combed out gently after bathing. The {{softened}} scales {{can then be}} brushed away with a soft brush, comb or cloth, but if not done <b>very</b> <b>gently,</b> this could worsen the condition and bring about temporary hair loss. [...] Applying petroleum jelly (e.g., Vaseline) liberally overnight is another popular treatment. [...] The softened scales either fall off during the night, or can be brushed off in the morning. [...] Making a paste from sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and leaving it on the affected area for 10 minutes can also help lift the scales. There have been no studies done on these treatments.|$|E
60|$|After that Sir Gawaine {{laid him}} down to sleep, and he slept <b>very</b> peacefully and <b>gently</b> and without any anxiety whatsoever. And when the morning had come he bestirred himself and {{presently}} there came to him those two esquires and aided him to arise. And they brought new rich garments for him to wear, and they brought him food wherewith to refresh himself, and after that they brought him a suit of splendid armor, polished like a mirror and inlaid with various singular devices in gold.|$|R
60|$|She {{laid her}} hand on his. It was warm, felt strong, {{although}} so motionless and helpless. George was so vigorous, so alive, and strong-willed; it seemed impossible that life might be going to play him false. She recalled the unflinching look of his steel-bright eyes, his deep, queerly vibrating voice, which had no trace of self-consciousness or pretence. She slipped {{her hand on}} to his heart, and began <b>very</b> slowly, <b>gently</b> rubbing it. He, as doctor, and she, as nurse, had both seen so much of death these last two years! Yet it seemed suddenly {{as if she had}} never seen death, and that the young faces she had seen, empty and white, in the hospital wards, had just been a show. Death would appear to her for the first time, if this face which she loved were to be drained for ever of light and colour and movement and meaning.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Very</b> {{carefully}} and <b>gently</b> Mowgli lifted the bodies aside, and raised Akela to his feet, both arms round him, and the Lone Wolf drew a long breath, {{and began the}} Death Song that {{a leader of the}} Pack should sing when he dies. It gathered strength as he went on, lifting and lifting, and ringing far across the river, till it came to the last [...] "Good hunting!" [...] and Akela shook himself clear of Mowgli for an instant, and, leaping into the air, fell backward dead upon his last and most terrible kill.|$|R
2500|$|The {{surrounding}} countryside is fertile {{agricultural land}} producing grains and providing grazing for cattle. [...] Topographically {{the region is}} composed of <b>very</b> <b>gently</b> rolling terrain quite suitable for agriculture. [...] In the 18th century the estate would have amounted to approximately 190 square kilometres. [...] While there were numerous smaller residences on the estate from the 18th century on, in the 19th and 20th century more development has taken place closer to Monboddo House {{in the form of}} several single family residences. [...] The estate has a peaceful setting being several kilometers from the nearest dual carriageway, the A90. [...] Sound levels were measured at the estate to be in the range of 48 to 53 dBA.|$|E

2500|$|The Mekong River flows southward {{from the}} Cambodia-Laos border {{to a point}} south of Kratié (town), where it turns west for about [...] and then turns {{southwest}} towards Phnom Penh. Extensive rapids run north of Kratie city. From Kampong Cham Province the gradient slopes <b>very</b> <b>gently,</b> and inundation of areas along the river occurs at flood stage. From June through November—through breaks in the natural levees that have built up along its course. At Phnom Penh four major water courses meet at a point called the Chattomukh (Four Faces). The Mekong River flows in from the northeast and the Tonle Sap river emanates from the Tonle Sap—flows in from the northwest. They divide into two parallel channels, the Mekong River proper and the Bassac River, and flow independently through the delta areas of Cambodia and Vietnam to the South China Sea.|$|E
