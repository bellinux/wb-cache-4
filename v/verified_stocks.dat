40|$|Abstract Background The {{voluntary}} {{carbon market}} is a new and growing market that is increasingly important to consider in managing forestland. Monitoring, reporting, and <b>verifying</b> carbon <b>stocks</b> and fluxes at a project level is the single largest direct cost of a forest carbon offset project. There are now many methods for estimating forest stocks with high accuracy that use both Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and high-resolution optical remote sensing data. However, many of these methods are not appropriate for use under existing carbon offset standards and most have not been field tested. Results This paper presents a pixel-based forest stratification method that uses both ALS and optical remote sensing data to optimally partition the variability across an ~ 10, 000 ha forest ownership in Mendocino County, CA, USA. This new stratification approach improved {{the accuracy of the}} forest inventory, reduced the cost of field-based inventory, and provides a powerful tool for future management planning. This approach also details a method of determining the optimum pixel size to best partition a forest. Conclusions The use of ALS and optical remote sensing data can help reduce the cost of field inventory and can help to locate areas that need the most intensive inventory effort. This pixel-based stratification method may provide a cost-effective approach to reducing inventory costs over larger areas when the remote sensing data acquisition costs can be kept low on a per acre basis. </p...|$|R

This research attempts to identify an international market where a) useful investor overreaction exists, and b) relatively strong currency performance adds further returns. From a list of 17 potential stock exchanges in developed and semi-developed markets, 2 bourses were selected for detailed evaluation –namely the Hong Kong and Frankfurt Stock Exchanges. Twelve years of historical data were used {{to determine the extent of}} out-performance possible. Advances on previous research include the use of filtering techniques to exclude high risk shares, the quantification of volatility when investing in “loser” portfolios, and the determination of risk adjusted out-performance. While significant, risk-adjusted out-performance was <b>verified</b> in the <b>Stock</b> Exchange of Hong Kong, no significant overreaction was found on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Juvenile {{coho salmon}} (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and steelhead trout (Salmo gairdneri) of {{different}} stocks and three transferrin genotypes (AA, AC, and CC), all reared in identical or similar environments, were experimentally {{infected with the}} causative agent of bacterial kidney disease (BKD) or Vibrio anguillarum. Mortality due to the pathogens was compared among stocks within a species and among transferrin genotypes within a stock {{to determine if there}} was a genetic basis for resistance to disease among stocks and transferrin genotypes. Differences in resistance to BKD among coho salmon stocks have a genetic basis. Stock susceptibility to vibriosis is strongly influenced by environmental factors. Coho salmon or steelhead trout of one stock may be resistant to one disease but susceptible to another. The importance of transferrin genotype of coho salmon in resistance to BKD is stock-specific; in those stocks which showed differential resistance of genotypes the AA was the most susceptible. No differences in resistance to vibriosis among transferrin genotypes were observed. To further <b>verify</b> that <b>stock</b> differences, both genetic and environmental, did exist, vertebral and lateral series scale numbers were compared among four steelhead trout stocks (Alsea, Siletz, Rogue, and North Santiam) reared in a common environment and at the hatchery of their origin. The four stocks are genetically different from each other with respect to vertebral and scale number in almost all cases. Differences between steelhead trout of the same stock reared at two localities were significant for vertebral but not scale number. Not all meristic differences between hatchery-reared stocks were significant...|$|R
40|$|A trading halt is {{a measure}} {{conducted}} by a securities exchange {{in order to reduce}} information imbalances between market participants, thus enabling a higher level of market efficiency. A market is said to be efficient when new information concerning a company is instantly reflected in its stock price, implying that abnormal stock returns cannot be systematically achieved in an efficient market. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the occurrence of abnormal stock returns following trading halts on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. The study is based on a sample of 64 trading halts executed between January 2003 and February 2008. Historical daily prices for stocks subject to trading halts during the period have been gathered from the Datastream Advance database, while information on date and time of trading halts have been collected from the Stockholm Stock Exchange website. For analysis of abnormal returns, an event study has been carried out using the market model for estimation of expected returns. Furthermore, statistical t-tests have been used in order to evaluate the significance of abnormal returns found in the study. Results indicate that no significant abnormal returns can be <b>verified</b> for <b>stocks</b> subject to initially positive post-event price reaction. Meanwhile, significant abnormal returns occur for stocks subject to negative initial post-event price reaction, consistent with results found by Kryzanowski (1979). Additionally, results indicate that trading halt duration has little impact on the amount of abnormal returns following a halt. We conclude that although significant abnormal returns are indicated for individual days within the event window for a specific part of the sample, not enough evidence has been found in the study to confirm the existence of systematic market inefficiency on the Stockholm Stock Exchange...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the pricing and hedging of an index option where one {{constituents}} stock plays an overly dominant role in the index. Under a Geometric Brownian Motion assumption we compare {{the distribution of the}} relative value of the index if the dominant stock is modeled separately {{from the rest of the}} index, or not. The former is equivalent to the relative index value being distributed as the sum of two lognormal random variables and the latter is distributed as a single lognormal random variable. Since these are not equal in distribution, we compare the two models. The validity of this theoretical result is <b>verified</b> against empirical <b>stock</b> market data. We look at two main models representing these cases: first, we use numerical methods to solve the two-dimensional problem directly; second, we make simplifying assumptions to reduce the two-dimensional Black-Scholes problem to a one-dimensional Black-Scholes problem that can be solved analytically. Since the terminal conditions of an option are usually non-smooth the numerical methods are verified by comparison to a Monte Carlo simulated solution. Attributes of the models that we compare are the relative option price differences and expected hedging profits. We compare the models for various volatilities, dominance levels, correlations and risk free rates. This work is significant in options trading because when a stock becomes dominant in its index the distribution of the returns changes. Even if the effect is small, given the millions of dollars exposed to index option trades, it has a material impact...|$|R

For that, this study used, after the elimination of atypical observations, and using the data from 343 companies, in wich 122 are owned by Novo Mer-cado (NM) list, 17 to Nivel 2 (N 2), 37 to Nivel 1 (N 1) and 167 that were not owned by any govern-ance special segment (Grupo Tradicional – GT). To statistic operationalization, there were used hypoth-esis tests (t test and ANOVA) to verify if there were substantial differences between the ownership dispersion averages of especial corporate governance and the traditional segments averages from BM&FBOVESPA. The percentual of stocks belonged to stockholders with less than 5 % of stocks from each species were used as proxy of dispersion degree.

40|$|Precise {{determination}} {{of changes in}} organic carbon (OC) stocks is prerequisite to understand the role of soils in the global cycling of carbon and to <b>verify</b> changes in <b>stocks</b> due to management. A large dataset was collected to form base to repeated soil inventories at 12 CarboEurope sites under different climate and land-use, and with different soil types. Concentration of OC, bulk density (BD), and fine earth fraction were determined to 60 cm depth at 100 sampling points per site. We investigated (1) time needed to detect changes in soil OC, assuming future re-sampling of 100 cores; (2) the contribution of different sources of uncertainties to OC stocks; (3) the effect of OC stock calculation on mass rather than volume base for change detection; and (4) the potential use of pedotransfer functions (PTF) for estimating BD in repeated inventories. The period of time needed for soil OC stocks to change strongly enough to be detectable depends on the spatial variability of soil properties, the depth increment considered, {{and the rate of}} change. Cropland sites, having small spatial variability, had lower minimum detectable differences (MDD) with 100 sampling points (105 &plusmn; 28 kg C m− 2 for the upper 10 cm of the soil) than the grassland (206 &plusmn; 64 kg C m− 2 ) and forest (246 &plusmn; 64 kg C m− 2 ) sites. Expected general trends in soil OC indicate that changes could be detectable after 2 – 15 years with 100 samples if changes occurred in the upper 10 cm of stone-poor soils. Error propagation analyses showed that in undisturbed soils with low stone contents, OC concentrations contributed most to OC stock variability while BD and fine earth fraction were more important in upper soil layers of croplands and in stone rich soils. Though the calculation of OC stocks based on equivalent soil masses slightly decreases the chance to detect changes with time at most sites except for the croplands, it is still recommended to account for changing bulk densities with time. Application of PTF for the estimation of bulk densities caused considerable underestimation of total variances of OC stocks if the error associated with the PTF was not accounted for, which rarely is done in soil inventories. Direct measurement of all relevant parameters approximately every 10 years is recommended for repeated soil OC inventories...|$|R
