40|$|ABSTRACT: A sulfide:quinone {{oxidoreductase}} (SQR) {{was isolated}} from the membranes of the hyperthermoa-cidophilic archaeon Acidianus ambivalens, and its X-ray structure, the first reported for an SQR, was determined to 2. 6 A ̊ resolution. This enzymewas functionally and structurally characterized andwas shown to have two redox active sites: a covalently bound FAD and an adjacent pair of cysteine residues. Most interestingly, the X-ray structure revealed {{the presence of a}} chain of three sulfur atoms bridging those two cysteine residues. The possible implications of this observation in the catalytic mechanism for sulfide oxidation are discussed, and the role of SQR in the sulfur dependent bioenergetics of A. ambivalens, linked to oxygen reduction, is addressed. Hydrogen sulfide was discovered by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1777 (1). It is considered a <b>very</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> for aerobic organisms hampering oxygen transport and inhibiting oxygen reduction by heme:copper oxygen reductases, thus preventing energy production by oxidative phosphorylation.

40|$|Dams for {{leachate}} store <b>very</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> {{that contain}} {{a large amount}} of organic material and, probably, heavy metals; they therefore constitute an important threat to the environment. Existing models of environmental risk assessment for landfills do not take into consideration the specific risk that leachate dams may represent for the environment. In this paper a methodology to improve the environmental safety is presented according to the parameters used in their construction and management. In order to do that, the following characteristics of the dam must be known: (1) geotechnical stability, (2) erosion of downstream slope, (3) type of sealing of the dam, (4) overtopping probability, (5) volume of leachate stored inside the dam and (6) pollution load of leachate. Once these parameters have been calculated, they are transformed by means of rating curves into homogeneous units, so as to make it possible to operate between them. From the study and analysis of these parameters an environmental risk index for a dam for leachate can be calculated. If the environmental risk index exceeds an established value then it involves a dam for leachate with high environmental risk, therefore preventive measures in its design, construction and management would be necessary. © 2008 Elsevier B.

An effective and economical solution to reduce ammonia-N in poultry manure wastewater is needed. The objective {{of this research was}} to determine the kinetic parameter for ammonia-N removal by using soil mixed culture (SMC). Ammonia-N was removed through nitrification process. Monod Model was used to represent nitrification process using SMC. Two types of SMC were utilized in this study namely, peat soil mixed culture (PS) and poultry farm soil mixed culture (PFS). There were two kinetic parameters determined from this study; maximum nitrification rate, k (h - 1) and saturation constant, KN(mg/l). k value was representing the time taken for the ammonia-N to be reduced and K representing the reduced ammonia-N concentration. Kinetic parameters were determined using Linear Regression Method. k and KN values were calculated for both the PS and PFS. The kinetic constants for nitrification were determined as k= 1. 23 h- 1 and KN= 67. 61 mg/l for PS and k= 1. 09 h and KN= 68. 454 mg/l for PFS. The values of k and K were representing the maximum reduction of ammonia-N concentration and the time taken for the process respectively. The kinetic constants could be applied as design parameter in scale-up process. PFS showed better performance in reducing the ammonia-N concentration compared to PS. It was founded that PFS removed ammonia-N at higher rate compared to PS.

30|$|Some of the {{erroneous}} {{assumptions and}} misconceptions {{of the respondents}} must be regarded as dangerous as they thwart a decent safety behavior. This {{is especially true for}} persons who assumed that products manufactured in the European Union, products without hazard pictograms, natural pharmaceuticals, natural personal care products, homeopathic products or products with an eco-label would be free of harmful substances. There seems to be a lack of awareness of chemical risks even in motivated informed consumers. This results in a subjective feeling of security, which is actually pseudo safety due to insufficient understanding. Given that three out of four respondents postulate that consumers take over the responsibility for minimizing harmful substances in consumer products, this result is rather alarming. It remains unclear how end-users should bear responsibility and reduce the risk posed by harmful substances {{as long as they do}} not have the knowledge to make sufficiently informed choices. Avoidance is the favored risk reduction strategy chosen by the majority of the study participants (see answers b and c in Fig.  3), which is a useful general strategy for consumers. Reading the description and instructions on the packaging (see Fig.  3 answers d and e) is only helpful if this leads to the recommended safety behavior. Reading alone does not reduce risk. Also small doses of <b>very</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> can lead to severe deleterious effects. Disposal of the product after use according to instructions (see Fig.  3 answer a) is certainly a good way of reducing environmental exposure, but this is not sufficient for products which are discharged via the waste water after use such as washing and cleaning agents, rinse off personal care products or products directly discharged into the environment such as pesticides.|$|R

In the present study, Activated carbons were prepared from biomass by chemical activation, using Na 2 CO 3 as a chemical agent for our research work preparation of activated carbon from biomass i. e. peanut shell. The effects of different parameters, such as chemical/biomass ratio, activation time and activation temperature, weight loss, proximate analysis, TGA, FTIR and iodine number of the produced activated carbons will be studied.

40|$|The rising mercury levels {{found in}} many Scandinavian rivers and lakes {{and its effect on}} the aquatic biota and their food chains is still not fully {{explored}} and likely underestimated. Since the Industrialisation in the 20 th century, mercury (Hg) is a indispensable metal for today’s economy resulting in great atmospheric inputs and Hg distribution over the whole planet. If Hg reaches an aquatic ecosystem, a certain fraction methylates into methylmercury (MeHg). MeHg is a <b>very</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> and might bioaccumulate and biomagnify in aquatic food chains, meaning increasing Hg concentrations in biomass at higher trophic levels. The amount of Hg that is uptaken and stored by fish can be influenced by different water-temperatures and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) input. In order to understand the effects of both factors regarding the Hg uptake in fish, this study investigates the Hg concentration in fish that were raised in different treated water pools. The experimental set-up consisted of pools that were either cold and without additional DOC, cold with additional DOC, warm without additional DOC and warm with additional DOC. I found that Hg uptake in fish increased in pools with colder temperature and additional DOC input. However, changes in water-temperature might enhance as well as diminish Hg bioaccumulation, depending on the environmental circumstances like aquatic biota or water chemistry. Furthermore the experiment showed a varying Hg uptake in fish over the sampling time from July, September and Octobre 2013. This outcome demonstrates that increasing Hg levels in fish depend on the time that is given to store and bioaccumulate this substance. Hence, the results confirm the hypotheses of increasing Hg uptake in fish due to additional DOC input and colder water-temperature. This study also highlights the importance of further and more extensive research on the aquatic mercury cycle and especially the different environmental factors affecting the Hg uptake in fish. ...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. Aquatic {{toxicology}} is {{the qualitative}} and quantitative study of toxic effects of pollutants on aquatic organisms. The main goal in toxicity testing is to predict, {{in combination with other}} environmental factors, with known accuracy, a concentration of a specific toxicant that will not harm a system and to make this prediction in a responsible and cost effective manner. There are a variety of unique toxicity tests, with fish being {{one of the most popular}} organisms to work with, due to being the best-understood organism in the aquatic environment and its commercial importance. Zinc, copper and cadmium are three biologically important heavy metals that are commonly used in various industries. Low concentrations zinc and copper are essential micronutrients for both plants and animals, but in higher concentrations they become toxic to the environment and its biota. Cadmium has a chemical structure similar to that of zinc and is often found in association with it, but it is a <b>very</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>substance.</b> The effects of zinc, copper and cadmium on the free-embryo life stage (yolk sac phase) of Oreochromis mossambicus were examined, for evaluation as a possible ¡§early life stage¡¨ fish lethality assessment. ¡§Fish early life stage tests¡¨ are considered to be relatively quick, comparable and inexpensive screening tools for testing effluents and chemicals. The yolk-sac stage is considered the most sensitive life stage in fish. O. mossambicus free-embryos feed endogenously and are indigenous to southern Africa and are therefore a good choice for lethality testing. The effects of the same metals on randomly selected Culicidae (mosquito) larvae were also tested. The reason for randomly selected larvae was to determine the possibility of doing toxicity testing without a species-specific culture. Mosquitoes are very common and well known due to being vectors of various human diseases. Recommendations towards future studies, to determine the usefulness of both O. mossambicus embryos and Culicidae larvae as biological indicator organisms, were also looked at. Prof. G. J. Stey...|$|E

But results are not always satisfactory for porosity and microstructure reasons. The contribution of laser cladding is also studied. This allows the formation of denser coatings. In fact, both processes appear to be very complementary. Thus, it is interesting to compare the environmental and technical results obtained with these two technologies. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} propose coatings, with a justified environmental behaviour, carried out by thermal spray processes (APS and HVOF) and laser cladding (with a diode laser) which could replace hard chromium coatings in order to resist wear and/or corrosion. The originality of this step lies in the optimization of the coating processes, in order to offer transferable alternatives to industrial production. To take into account the environmental properties of these coatings from the point of view of materials and processes, Life Cycle Assessment of the surface coating processes was established, which constitutes the genuine characteristic of the study. The ecodesign of surface coatings has not been reported in detail in the current literature. Thus two types of materials, stainless steel and self-fluxing NiCrBSi alloy, were chosen to be the coatings on a steel substrate. Then, chemical characterization (corrosion in salt spray test) was carried out in order to determine the alternative potential of dry coatings, especially NiCrBSi coatings, compared to electrolytic hard chromium plating...|$|R

There are several toxic proteins that could potentially be used in bioterrorism or biocrime.

A galactose affinity method was developed for the enrichment and subsequent analysis of ricin, abrin and botulinum neurotoxin. The method’s applicability was confirmed during a forensic investigation into illegal toxin preparations. Additionally, the investigations generated new information on the structural properties of ricin that will facilitate the forensic matching of samples to sources. Details of botulinum neurotoxin’s sophisticated intoxication mechanisms were determined by using a broad analytical approach to study the importance and heterogeneity of SV 2 C glycosylation.
