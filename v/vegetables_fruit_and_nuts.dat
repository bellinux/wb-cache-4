To assess the association between adherence to the MDP and the incidence of clinical depression. Prospective study that uses a validated 136 -item food frequency questionnaire to assess adherence to the MDP. The MDP score positively weighted the consumption of <b>vegetables,</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>nuts,</b> cereal, legumes, and fish; the monounsaturated- to saturated-fatty-acids ratio; and moderate alcohol consumption, whereas meat or meat products and whole-fat dairy were negatively weighted. A dynamic cohort of university graduates (Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra/University of Navarra Follow-up [SUN] Project). A total of 10 094 initially healthy Spanish participants from the SUN Project participated in the study. Recruitment began on December 21, 1999, and is ongoing. Participants were classified as having incident depression if they were free of depression and antidepressant medication at baseline and reported a physician-made diagnosis of clinical depression and/or antidepressant medication use during follow-up. After a median follow-up of 4. 4 years, 480 new cases of depression were identified. The multiple adjusted hazard ratios (95 % confidence intervals) of depression for the 4 upper successive categories of adherence to the MDP (taking the category of lowest adherence as reference) were 0. 74 (0. 57 - 0. 98), 0. 66 (0. 50 - 0. 86), 0. 49 (0. 36 - 0. 67), and 0. 58 (0. 44 - 0. 77) (P for trend <. 001). Inverse dose-response relationships were found for fruit and nuts, the monounsaturated- to saturated-fatty-acids ratio, and legumes. Our results suggest a potential protective role of the MDP with regard to the prevention of depressive disorders; additional longitudinal studies and trials are needed to confirm these findings.

40|$|CTA has {{supported}} the translation into English of The cultivated plants of the Tropics and Subtropics by Sigmund Rehm and Gustav Espig. This is both a reference handbook for those working in this field and a text book for students of agriculture and related subjects. Originally published in German in 1984, it describes over 1, 000 cultivated crops. An introduction {{to each of the}} main plant groups looks at the economics, production trends, nutritional value and uses of the group. The major crops are then discussed in more detail and information provided on production figures and distribution, breeding of cultivars, ecophysiology, cultivation, pests and diseases, and harvesting and processing. Much of the information on individual species. and on the less widely-grown cross. is presented in clear tables which include columns for specific points of interest. Food crops are divided into main groups; cereals, root and tuber crops, sugar, oil <b>vegetables,</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>nuts.</b> There is a section on beverages and stimulants, which includes tobacco, and sections on spices, medicinal plants, essential oils, fibre plants, elastomers, dyes and tanning materials etc. Fodder grasses and fodder legumes are also included, as are crops which are used for ancillary purposes such as wind-breaks and soil stabilizers. The book is illustrated throughout with clear black-and-white line drawings. Numbered references relate to an extensive list of recent publications which give the reader the opportunity to find further information on specific crops or subject areas.

Our comments are focused on clarifying the guidelines as they relate to analysis and mitigation of agricultural resources. California is the countryâs largest agricultural state, producing the majority of the countryâs <b>vegetables,</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> leading in the production of dairy products. Our $ 43 billion (2012) agricultural economy is dependent upon a productive agricultural land base. However, inconsistent implementation of CEQA on projects that convert agricultural resources to non-agricultural uses threatens to undermine this land base. California loses between 30, 000 and 50, 000 acres of agricultural land per year 1. Our experience at the local level suggests that for many projects that convert agricultural land to non-agricultural uses that mitigation is either not required or inadequately addresses the loss of agricultural resources. Only nine counties out of the 58 California counties have farmland mitigation policies 2. Eight cities have farmland mitigation policies. All require 1 : 1 or higher mitigation ratios. But for many of the remaining counties and cities without farmland mitigation policies it is still the Wild West when it comes to CEQA review and mitigation of agricultural resources. The consequence is permanent loss of agricultural land, a resource we cannot reproduce. A revision of the CEQA guidelines can provide certainty for landowners and developers alike and clarity on the issue...|$|R

Until the last few years, most of the sales were to a number of produce brokers who sold the produce for Phil in the wholesale market on a commission basis. Believing he could get better prices by selling direct to retailers, two years ago Phil started a local delivery route to small grocery stores wishing to sell organic produce. The delivery route has enjoyed success, but now requires significant additional investment of both time and money {{if it is to be}} maintained and expanded. Phil Foster must now decide if expanding the local delivery route will be worth the investment cost and effort. Through situation analysis, this case study examines Phil's decision-making options. case study, farm financial management, marketing, organic, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R
