40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{high-resolution}} imaging of vineyards, obtained by unmanned aerial vehicle recognitions, has provided new opportunities to obtain valuable information for precision farming applications. While available semi-automatic image processing algorithms {{are now able to}} detect parcels and extract vine rows from aerial images, the identification of single plant inside the rows is a problem still unaddressed. This study presents a new methodology for the segmentation of vine rows in virtual shapes, each representing a real plant. From the virtual shapes, an extensive set of features is discussed, extracted and coupled to a statistical classifier, to evaluate its performance in missing plant detection within a <b>vineyard</b> <b>parcel.</b> Passing from continuous images to a discrete set of individual plants results in a crucial simplification of the statistical investigation of the problem...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} determining factors and a method to predict the existence of gully erosion in <b>vineyard</b> <b>parcels.</b> The Alt Penedès-Anoia region (Catalonia, NE Spain), mainly dedicated to the cropping of vineyards for high quality wine production, {{was selected as the}} case study area. Single factors related to the existence of gully erosion were determined by means of statistical tests (Student’s t-test and chi-square). The existence of gully erosion was predicted by means of a multivariate procedure. A stepwise selection of variables (relief, soil, land use/management characteristics) was performed, which allowed the identification of factors that present a significant relationship with the existence of gully erosion. The selected factors, slope degree and planar slope form, were considered as independent variables in a logistic regression of binary response. The model computes the probability that gullies exist in given <b>vineyard</b> <b>parcels,</b> and it can be implemented in a raster-based geographical information system (GIS). The assessment of the model in 52 parcels, different from the training data set, yielded an overall accuracy of 84. 6 %. The predictive model can be applied for areas with similar conditions, but the modelling approach can be applied in other different areas. # 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the past}} few years a number of {{examples}} of remote sensing data applied for viticulture {{have been reported in the}} literature. Although most cases are based on airborne data, there are some examples where satellite images have been used for mapping and monitoring vineyards, mostly in places where the vineyard areas are extensive. A practical evaluation of the applicability of satellite remote sensing data to a test site with small <b>vineyard</b> <b>parcels</b> was carried out using SPOTand Chris Proba images. The typical results possible under these conditions are presented and themain limitations are briefly discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the {{structural}} changes development of vineyard type of cultural agriculture landscape in Čajkov cadastre. In landscape space out of built up rural settlement Čajkov the vineyards create a specific landscape segment which covers 6 % of the whole cadastre area. Two time development periods are compared, i. e. 1896 s and 2010 s, or 2011 s with emphasis to land use form changes and area size changes of <b>vineyard</b> <b>parcels.</b> The result shows that vineyards represent more than 100 hundred years continuity of historical valuable cultural landscape which was not influenced by agricultural collectivisation processes within the second part of the 20 th century. The second part of the paper is aimed to assess cultural value of the vineyards by using 9 different criteria such as: age of vineyards, area plots and mosaic structures, archaic vine technology, anthropogenic relief, old vineyard’s buildings and sacral architectural elements, old large and rare fruit trees, traditional and local vine sorts, archaeological locality and finds. Assessed vineyards landscape of Čajkov cadastre is unique, has well preserved historical continuity in landscape structure and a high cultural and historic value...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this article, {{we develop}} a novel method for the {{detection}} of <b>vineyard</b> <b>parcels</b> in agricultural landscapes based on very high resolution (VHR) optical remote sensing images. Our objective is to perform texture-based image retrieval and supervised classification algorithms. To do that, the local textural and structural features inside each image are taken into account to measure its similarity to other images. In fact, VHR images usually involve a variety of local textures and structures that may verify a weak stationarity hypothesis. Hence, an approach only based on characteristic points, not on all pixels of the image, is supposed to be relevant. This work proposes to construct the local extrema-based descriptor (LED) by using the local maximum and local minimum pixels extracted from the image. The LED descriptor is formed based on the radiometric, geometric and gradient features from these local extrema. We first exploit the proposed LED descriptor for the retrieval task to evaluate its performance on texture discrimination. Then, it is embedded into a supervised classification framework to detect vine parcels using VHR satellite images. Experiments performed on VHR panchromatic PLEIADES image data prove the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, an enhancement of about 7 % in retrieval rate is achieved. For the detection task, about 90 % of vineyards are correctly detected...|$|R

40|$|Vineyard {{is among}} the crops the most heavily treated with pesticides. In {{the context of the}} new EU policy for the {{protection}} of water resources, vineyard area will account as one of the major contributor to water contamination. Grass buffer strips have recently been developed as a solution for reducing pesticide transfer by surface runoff from <b>vineyard</b> <b>parcels</b> to adjacent streams. Although pesticide interception by grass strips has generally been proven effective, {{little is known about the}} fate of intercepted pesticides. In order to tackle this question we worked since several years at the scale of a small watershed located in the Beaujolais vineyard (France). The ability of the soil microflora to degrade diuron, an herbicide belonging to phenyl-urea family, was addressed by radiorespirometric analyses showing that the grass buffer strip could develop efficient degrading ability if regularly exposed to the contaminant 1. Interestingly, we revealed the presence of bacterial populations able to rapidly mineralize this herbicide in the grass buffer strips. We also showed that their genetic potential (puhA and puhB genes) could be transferred by erosion to the sediment of the river adjacent to the grass buffer strip 2. With the aim to promote natural attenuation of pesticides in the grass buffer strip, bioaugmentation experiments with diuron-degrading bacterial populations are ongoing. All these data seem to indicate that the development of a second generation of engineered grass buffer strip acting as an ‘in field bioreactor’ favoring pesticide biodegradation could represent an interesting tool to protect water resources in the vineyard area...|$|R

40|$|Capsule’’: Soil particle-size {{composition}} {{can be used}} {{to assess}} distribution of copper in soils. The intensive use for over 100 years of copper sulfate (Bordeaux mixture) to fight against mildew in vineyard soils has led to an important, widespread accumulation of Cu (100 to 1500 mg Cu kgÿ 1 soil). In Champagne vineyards, organic amendments are used currently to increase soil fertility and to limit soil erosion. Organic amendments may have a direct eect on the retention of Cu in the soil. To assess the influence of the organic management on the fate of Cu in calcareous Champagne vineyard soils, we studied Cu distribution (1) in the soil profile and (2) among primary soil particles, in <b>vineyard</b> <b>parcels</b> with dierent amendments. Amendments were oak-bark, vine-shoots and urban compost. The results were compared with the amount and the distribution of Cu in an unamended calcareous soil. Physical soil fractionations were carried out to separate soil primary particles according to their size and density. Cu has a heterogeneous distribution among soil particle fractions. Two fractions were mainly responsible for Cu retention in soils: the organic debris larger than 50 mm or coarse particulate organic matter (POM) issued from the organic amendments, and the clay-sized fraction < 2 mm. The POM contained up to 2000 mg Cu kgÿ 1 fraction and the clay fraction con-tained up to 500 mg Cu kgÿ 1 fraction. The clay-sized fraction was responsible for almost 40 % of the total amount of Cu in the four parcels. POM was predominantly responsible for the dierences in Cu contents between the unamended and the three amended parcels. Our results attested that methods of soil particle-size fractionation can be successfully used to assess the distribution o...|$|R

During the 1950s and 1960s, the San Bernardino area became a popular stop during road trips. This resulted in more shops opening up to serve the needs of travelers, and more people establishing permanent residences around the Muscoy area.
