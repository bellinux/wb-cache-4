5|$|Antioxidants, such as {{vitamins}} C and E, {{have been}} proposed {{to protect against the}} disease, but results of studies have been contradictory and no positive effect has been proven.

There have been preliminary indications that the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium channel blockers may be protective. A 2010 meta-analysis found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (apart from aspirin), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson's disease.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{classification}} by Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, Oryzomys antillarum {{is one of}} eight species in the genus Oryzomys, which occurs from the eastern United States (O.palustris) into northwestern South America (O.gorgasi).

Oryzomys previously included many other species, which were progressively removed in <b>various</b> <b>studies</b> culminating in the 2006 paper by Weksler and colleagues, which excluded more than forty species from the genus.

5|$|Another {{prominent}} early anthropologist, Thomas Wingate Todd, {{was primarily}} responsible {{for the creation of}} the first large collection of human skeletons in 1912.

Todd's contributions to the field of anthropology remain in use in the modern era and include <b>various</b> <b>studies</b> regarding suture closures on the skull and timing of teeth eruption in the mandible. Todd also developed age estimates based on physical characteristics of the pubic symphysis. Though the standards have been updated, these estimates are still used by forensic anthropologists to narrow down an age range of skeletonized remains. These early pioneers legitimized the field of anthropology, {{but it was not until}} the 1940s, with the help of Todd's student, Wilton M. Krogman, that forensic anthropology gained recognition as a legitimate subdiscipline.|$|E

5|$|<b>Various</b> <b>studies</b> have {{investigated}} the use of anticoagulation to suppress blood clot formation in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Before these trials had been conducted, {{there had been a}} concern that small areas of hemorrhage in the brain would bleed further as a result of treatment; the studies showed that this concern was unfounded. Clinical practice guidelines now recommend heparin or low molecular weight heparin in the initial treatment, followed by warfarin, provided there are no other bleeding risks that would make these treatments unsuitable. Some experts discourage the use of anticoagulation if there is extensive hemorrhage; in that case, they recommend repeating the imaging after 7–10days. If the hemorrhage has decreased in size, anticoagulants are started, while no anticoagulants are given if there is no reduction.|$|E

5|$|<b>Various</b> <b>studies</b> have {{suggested}} that several individuals would gather eggs in a single nest, and arrange them {{so they could be}} protected by one individual, possibly a male. In 2010 David J. Varricchio and colleagues found that the relatively large clutch-size of oviraptorids and troodontids is most similar to those of modern archosaurs (birds and crocodilians, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs) that practice polygamous mating and extensive male parental care (as seen in paleognaths such as ostriches and emus). This reproductive system pre-dates the origin of birds and would therefore be the ancestral condition for modern birds, with biparental care (where both parents participate) being a later development. Many oviraptorosaurs are known to have had pygostyles on the end of their tails, which suggests the presence of feather-fans; these could have been used for intraspecific communication such as courtship rituals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Various</b> <b>studies</b> of {{the tower}} took place from the late 18th century onwards. The {{antiquarian}} Francis Grose noted in 1783 that the tower was then called the Old Jail, recording a local tradition that the abbey had used the basement as a dungeon, and the upper storeys as a prison for lesser offences. During this period, the tower was used for drying and stowing hops, probably in advance of their being taken to local kilns. The artist J. M. W. Turner visited and sketched the tower around 1791. A group of French antiquarians visited in 1840, and commented on the considerable age of the building. Around 1863, {{a hole in the}} west wall, left by the attempted destruction of the stair turret, was filled with a new entrance way.|$|E

Corresponding figures for nasopharyngeal swabbing and vaccinations were 28 % and 12 %, respectively. Within the reported age group, increasing age was related with higher discomfort levels. In a majority of cases for all study procedures, the perceived levels of discomfort met the parents' expectations. ...|$|R
