5000|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of blow flies in the family Calliphoridae, Pollenia rudis does not play {{a large role in}} the medico-criminal subfield of forensic entomology. While most blow flies are attracted to rotting or decomposing matter, P. rudis is solely parasitic on earthworms and is unable to complete larval development on carrion. This unique characteristic makes it uncommon to see this particular blowfly near forensic investigations.However, the urban subfield of forensic entomology has been closely monitoring P. rudis because of its tendency to infest buildings and its status as a potential disease vector. Urban entomology, which deals with the insects that affect man and his immediate environment, is responsible for investigating economic issues and civil proceedings involving arthropods. There have been several economically hampering cases of P. rudis infestation around the world. For example, in New Zealand an entire city’s water reservoir tank was drained due to high levels of fecal coliform bacteria produced by mass amounts of cluster flies residing in the tank. Due to cases like these, scientists have investigated the association of Pollenia rudis and its disease <b>vector</b> <b>capability.</b> In 1973, a massive infestation of cluster flies in a German Hospital triggered an investigation of the relationship between P. rudis and bacteria pathogen transmission. Careful examination of the flies revealed P. rudis is only capable of transmitting bacteria that causes opportunistic infections. These results indicate that “mass infestations of cluster flies occurring in sensitive areas, especially in hospitals, may cause a low, but not neglectable health threat due to mechanical transmission of bacterial pathogens.” ...|$|E

Its life cycle, host plants, spatial distribution, infection and <b>vector</b> <b>capability</b> {{have been investigated}} in vine-growing areas of Piedmont, NW Italy. The spatial distribution of adults in vineyards was studied by applying interpolation methods to trap capture data. Insects were subject to molecular analyses to verify phytoplasma presence and identity. DNA extraction and PCR were made to detect 16 SrV phytoplasmas. Transmission experiments were set up, using different sources for phytoplasma acquisition, and two plant species and an artificial diet for inoculation. Whole mount in situ hybridization was made to detect phytoplasmas in the salivary glands of adults. In the vineyard agro-ecosystem, 19 plant species (11 families), mainly broadleaf trees and shrubs, were recognized as host plants of the insect. Adults were more abundant on putative host plants than on grapevines, with a clear clustering {{at the edges of}} vineyards, and without a massive intrusion into the vineyard from outside. 16 SrV phytoplasmas were detected only in adults captured with yellow sticky traps (20 out of 188 tested).

40|$|The continual {{development}} of sophisticated transport simulation algorithms allows increasingly accurate {{description of the}} effect of the passage of particles through matter. This modelling capability finds applications in a large spectrum of fields from medicine to astrophysics, and of course HEP. These new capabilities however come at the cost of a greater computational intensity of the new models, which has the effect of increasing the demands of computing resources. This is particularly true for HEP, where the demand for more simulation are driven by the need of both more accuracy and more precision, i. e. better models and more events. Usually HEP has relied on the "Moore's law" evolution, but since almost ten years the increase in clock speed has withered and computing capacity {{comes in the form of}} hardware architectures of many-core or accelerated processors. To harness these opportunities we need to adapt our code to concurrent programming models taking advantages of both SIMD and SIMT architectures. The Geant Vector Prototype (GeantV) has been designed both to exploit the <b>vector</b> <b>capability</b> of main stream CPUs and to take advantage of Coprocessors including NVidia's GPU and Intel Xeon Phi. The characteristics of each of those architectures are very different in term of the vectorization depth, parallelization needed to achieve optimal performance or memory access latency and speed. Between each platforms the number of individual tasks to be processed ?at once? for efficient use of the hardware varies sometimes by an order of magnitude. The granularity of the code executed may also need to be dynamically adjusted. An additional challenge is to avoid the code duplication often inherent to supporting heterogeneous platforms. We will present the challenges, solutions and resulting performance of running an end to end detector simulation concurrently on a main stream CPU and a coprocessor and detail the broker implementation bridging the disparity between the two architectures. The impacts of task decomposition, vectorization, efficient sampling techniques and data look-up using track level parallelism will be also evaluated on vector and massively parallel architectures. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{computational}} {{and experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the effects of multiple injection ports in a two-dimensional, convergentdivergent nozzle, for fluidic thrust vectoring. The concept of multiple injection ports was conceived to enhance the thrust <b>vectoring</b> <b>capability</b> of a convergentdivergent nozzle over that of a single injection port without increasing the secondary mass flow rate requirements. The experimental study was conducted at static conditions in the Jet Exit Test Facility of the 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel Complex at NASA Langley Research Center. Internal nozzle performance was obtained at nozzle pressure ratios up to 10 with secondary nozzle pressure ratios up to 1 for five configurations. The computational study was conducted using the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics code PAB 3 D with two-equation turbulence closure and linear Reynolds stress modeling. Internal nozzle performance was predicted for nozzle pressure ratios up to 10 with a secondary nozzle pressure ratio of 0. 7 for two configurations. Results from the experimental study indicate a benefit to multiple injection ports in a convergentdivergent nozzle. In general, increasing the number of injection ports from one to two increased the pitch thrust <b>vectoring</b> <b>capability</b> without any thrust performance penalties at nozzle pressure ratios less than 4 with high secondary pressure ratios.
