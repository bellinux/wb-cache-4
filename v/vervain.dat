The silex was the stone used for the fetial sacrifice, housed in the Temple of Iuppiter Feretrius, as was their sceptre. Sacred herbs (sagmina), sometimes identified as <b>vervain,</b> {{had to be taken}} from the nearby citadel (arx) for their ritual use.|$|E

2500|$|People {{also took}} steps {{specifically}} to ward-off or appease the aos sí. Food was left or milk poured at the doorstep or places {{associated with the}} aos sí, such as 'fairy trees', as an offering. In Ireland, cattle would be brought to 'fairy forts', where {{a small amount of}} their blood would be collected. The owners would then pour it into the earth with prayers for the herd's safety. Sometimes the blood would be left to dry and then be burnt. It was thought that dairy products were especially at risk from harmful spirits. To protect farm produce and encourage fertility, farmers would lead a procession around the boundaries of their farm. They would [...] "carry with them seeds of grain, implements of husbandry, the first well water, and the herb <b>vervain</b> (or rowan as a substitute). The procession generally stopped at the four cardinal points of the compass, beginning in the east, and rituals were performed {{in each of the four}} directions".|$|E

60|$|The <b>Vervains</b> were as lost {{to him as}} if Europe were {{in another}} planet. How should he find them there? Besides, he was poor; he had no money to get back with, if {{he had wanted to}} return.|$|R
2500|$|The mask-makers {{were called}} skeuopoios or [...] "maker of the properties," [...] thus {{suggesting}} that their role encompassed multiple duties and tasks. The masks {{were most likely}} made out of light weight, organic materials like stiffened linen, leather, wood, or cork, with the wig consisting of human or animal hair. Due to the visual restrictions imposed by these masks, it was imperative that the actors hear in order to orient and balance themselves. Thus, {{it is believed that}} the ears were covered by substantial amounts of hair and not the helmet-mask itself. The mouth opening was relatively small, preventing the mouth to be seen during performances. <b>Vervain</b> and Wiles posit that this small size discourages the idea that the mask functioned as a megaphone, as originally presented in the 1960s. Greek mask-maker, Thanos Vovolis, suggests that the mask serves as a resonator for the head, thus enhancing vocal acoustics and altering its quality. This leads to increased energy and presence, allowing for the more complete metamorphosis of the actor into his character.|$|E

50|$|Verbena bonariensis is {{a member}} of the South American <b>vervains,</b> which are {{polyploid}} and have more than 14 chromosomes.

60|$|He {{put on his}} hat {{and coat}} and strolled vaguely forth, and {{in an hour or}} two came by a {{roundabout}} course to the gondola station nearest his own house. There he stopped, and after an absent contemplation of the boats, from which the gondoliers were clamoring for his custom, he stepped into one and ordered the man to row him to a gate on a small canal opposite. The gate opened, at his ringing, into the garden of the <b>Vervains.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all. I don't think I could explain," [...] said Ferris with {{a certain}} air of regretting to have gone so far in comment on the Vervains. He added recklessly, [...] "Don't you see that Mrs. <b>Vervain</b> {{sometimes}} does and says things that embarrass her daughter, and that Miss <b>Vervain</b> seems to try to restrain her?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. <b>Vervain</b> came in {{smiling and}} cordial, {{apparently}} better and not worse for yesterday's misadventures.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. <b>Vervain</b> put on {{her glasses}} and peered down at the two with good- natured curiosity.|$|E
60|$|He {{returned}} at midnight, {{and lighting}} his candle {{took up the}} card and read it once more. He could not tell whether to be glad or sorry that {{he had failed to}} see the <b>Vervains</b> again. He took it for granted that Don Ippolito was to follow; he would not ask himself what motive had hastened their going. The reasons were all that he should never more look upon the woman so hatefully lost to him, but a strong instinct of his heart struggled against them.|$|R
6000|$|He {{thought at}} first that he might perhaps {{overtake}} the <b>Vervains</b> before they sailed for America, but he remembered that they had left Venice six weeks before. It seemed impossible that he could wait, but when he landed in New York, he was tormented in his impatience by a strange reluctance and hesitation. A fantastic light fell upon his plans; a sense of its wildness enfeebled his purpose. What {{was he going to}} do? Had he come four thousand miles to tell Florida that Don Ippolito was dead? Or was he going to say, [...] "I have heard that you love me, but I don't believe it: is it true?" ...|$|R
60|$|A soreness {{that had}} been lifted from his heart, came back; he walked home {{disappointed}} and defeated, he hardly knew why or in what. He did not laugh now to think how she had asked him that morning to forget her coming to him for help; he was outraged {{that he should have}} been repaid in this sort, and the rebuff with which his sympathy had just been met was vulgar; there was no other name for it but vulgarity. Yet he could not relate this quality to the face of the young girl as he constantly beheld it in his homeward walk. It did not defy him or repulse him; it looked up at him wistfully as from the gondola that morning. Nevertheless he hardened his heart. The <b>Vervains</b> should see him next when they had sent for him. After all, one is not so very old at twenty-six.|$|R
60|$|This letter {{reminded}} Mrs. <b>Vervain</b> {{that they}} had not seen Mr. Ferris for three days, and she sent to ask him to dinner. But he returned an excuse, and he was not to be had to breakfast the next morning for the asking. He was in open rebellion. Mrs. <b>Vervain</b> had herself rowed to the consular landing, and sent up her gondolier with another invitation to dinner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't think so," [...] {{returned}} Mrs. <b>Vervain.</b> [...] "She told me {{this morning}} that she'd made Don Ippolito promise {{to speak to you}} about it; but he didn't mention having done so, and--I hated, don't you know, to ask him.... In fact, Florida had told me beforehand that I mustn't. She said he must be left entirely to himself in that matter, and"--Mrs. <b>Vervain</b> looked suggestively at Ferris.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. <b>Vervain</b> sentimentalized their {{departure}} a little, but her daughter made {{no comment on}} the scene they were leaving.|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, besides, he {{was bound to}} Don Ippolito, {{who had come to}} him as the nearest friend of both, and confided in him. He remembered with a tardy, poignant {{intelligence}} how in their first talk of the <b>Vervains</b> Don Ippolito had taken pains to inform himself that Ferris was not in love with Florida. Could he be less manly and generous than this poor priest, and violate the sanctity of his confidence? Ferris groaned aloud. No, contrive it as he would, call it by what fair name he chose, he could not commit this treachery. It was the more impossible to him because, in this agony of doubt as to what he should do, he now at least read big own heart clearly, and had no longer a doubt what was in it. He pitied her for the pain she must suffer. He saw how her simple goodness, her blind sympathy with Don Ippolito, and only this, must have led the priest to the mistaken pass at which he stood. But Ferris felt that the whole affair had been fatally carried beyond his reach; he could do nothing now but wait and endure. There are cases in which a man must not protect the woman he loves. This was one.|$|R
60|$|Ferris {{filled his}} pipe {{and went out}} on his balcony again, and stood {{watching}} the gondola in its course toward the address he had given, and smoking thoughtfully. It was really the same girl who had given poor Don Ippolito that cruel slap in the face, yesterday. But that seemed no more out of reason than her sudden, generous, exaggerated remorse both were {{of a piece with}} her coming to him for help now, holding him at a distance, flinging herself upon his sympathy, and then trying to snub him, and breaking down in the effort. It was all of a piece, and the piece was bad; yes, she had an ugly temper; and yet she had magnanimous traits too. These contradictions, which in his reverie he felt rather than formulated, made him smile, as he stood on his balcony bathed by the morning air and sunlight, in fresh, strong ignorance of the whole mystery of women's nerves. These caprices even charmed him. He reflected that he had gone on doing the <b>Vervains</b> one favor after another in spite of Florida's childish petulancies; and he resolved that he would not stop now; her whims should be nothing to him, as they had been nothing, hitherto. It is flattering to a man to be indispensable to a woman so long as he is not obliged to it; Miss Vervain's dependent relation to himself in this visit gave her a grace in Ferris's eyes which she had wanted before.|$|R
60|$|The spring, {{which in}} Venice {{comes in the}} {{softening}} air and the perpetual azure of the heavens, was renewed to their senses in all its miraculous loveliness. The garden of the <b>Vervains</b> had indeed confessed it in opulence of leaf and bloom, but there it seemed somehow only like a novel effect of the artifice which {{had been able to}} create a garden in that city of stone and sea. Here a vernal world suddenly opened before them, with wide-stretching fields of green under a dome of perfect blue; against its walls only the soft curves of far-off hills were traced, and near at hand the tender forms of full-foliaged trees. The long garland of vines that festoons all Italy seemed to begin in the neighboring orchards; the meadows waved their tall grasses in the sun, and broke in poppies as the sea-waves break in iridescent spray; the well-grown maize shook its gleaming blades in the light; the poplars marched in stately procession {{on either side of the}} straight, white road to Padua, till they vanished in the long perspective. The blossoms had fallen from the trees many weeks before, but the air was full of the vague sweetness of the perfect spring, which here and there gathered and defined itself as the spicy odor of the grass cut on the shore of the canal, and drying in the mellow heat of the sun.|$|R
60|$|Before Mrs. <b>Vervain</b> could frame a protest, or lay hold of him, {{he bowed}} and hurried {{out of the}} land-gate.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. <b>Vervain</b> fitted on her glasses, {{but even}} then felt uncertainly about for the empty vase {{on the table before}} her.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is the matter?" [...] asked Mrs. <b>Vervain,</b> {{putting up}} her glasses, and trying with graceful {{futility}} {{to focus the}} melodrama.|$|E
40|$|Drought is {{a common}} {{occurrence}} for South Dakota beef producers. The variation in weed control that ranchers need to manage for is the intensity and duration of the rainfall shortages. The common problem however, {{is what happens when}} grass and forbs become stressed and the changes to the vegetation that occurs. Stresses or disturbances that cause the grasses to slow growth and open up bare areas can include several situations; over grazing, flooding, wild fires, severe hail, growing season freeze, soil disturbances (prairie dogs or pocket gophers), and drought. Weeds are very opportunistic and competitive and will readily invade bare areas of ground that are created by these conditions. Once established weeds will aggressively compete for light, nutrients, moisture and space. This will allow for quick weed establishment and when more favorable conditions occur, weeds will spread to new areas and weed densities will increase. Weeds can be divided into three growth categories; 1. Annuals, 2. Biennials, and 3. Perennials. Within these groups they can further be categorized as cool season or warm season plants or as a broadleaf, grass or sedge plants. The plants we tend to be more concerned with during or following drought are the broadleaf weeds. The broadleaf weeds that cause the biggest problems are those introduced or invasive plants that have gotten a foothold here. In South Dakota the invasive weeds of major emphasis for grasslands include Canada thistle, leafy spurge, hoary cress, the knapweeds, biennial thistles (musk, plumeless, bull and scotch), the toadflaxes, field bindweed, absinth wormwood and common mullein. All of these and others are on South Dakota’s state wide and locally noxious lists. They are considered regulated pests in the state. Another group of plants that can take advantage of drought and become a problem in range settings is some native forbs like the <b>vervains,</b> common sunflower, horseweed or marestail, golden rod family, perennial ragweed and cudweed sagewort. In normal conditions these plants are not considered invasive. They can have good forage value at certain growth stages. This can reduce grazing pressure on desirable grass species recovering form drought...|$|R
6000|$|... "Consular service? With all my heart," [...] {{answered}} Ferris, {{thinking for}} {{the third or fourth}} time how very young Miss <b>Vervain</b> was.|$|E
60|$|In {{the mean}} {{time he saw}} her gondola stop, turn round, {{and come back to}} the canal that bordered the <b>Vervain</b> garden.|$|E
60|$|Ferris rose to go. Mrs. <b>Vervain</b> {{wondered}} {{again in}} the same words why Don Ippolito had not been near them all day.|$|E
