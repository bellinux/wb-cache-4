40|$|Abstract { A 4 th-order Butterworth lowpass continuous-time lter, {{based on}} transconductance-C integrators, for {{applications}} in the <b>videofrequency</b> range is presented. Fabricated in a standard 0. 8 m CMOS technology (MOSIS HPCMOS 26 G), the circuit occupies an area of 0. 59 mm 2, including the automatic tuning circuitry, and dissipates 40 mW from a single 5 V supply. A simple transconductor is utilized, which provides good linearity and high-speed properties. Experimental results of a 10 -MHz, 60 -dB dynamic-range, lowpass lter are given. I...|$|E
