During informal discussions following the 1975 state election, Millhouse {{had been offered}} the deputy leadership in a merged party, and Cameron {{a leading role in}} the upper house, but following the poor showing at the federal election and the deteriorating financial state of the LM, the offer was reduced and the posts that had been offered to Millhouse and Cameron were no longer available. However, Hall was still able to negotiate for the LM President and Treasurer to be given positions on a new executive. He also agreed to forego any further senate bids. An agreement was put in place to protect Boundy from being ousted at a pre-selection of the new party, but this was broken at the next election. The LM was also given an equal <b>voting</b> <b>share</b> on pre-selection committees for three urban lower house seats.|$|E

25|$|Co-ownership co-ops are {{generally}} older apartment buildings, incorporated before the Ontario Condominium Act, 1973 came into existence, where shareholders each own one <b>voting</b> <b>share</b> in the corporation {{that owns the}} building and have a registered right to occupy individual units as described on their share certificate. Most {{of these types of}} co-ops date from the thirties, forties and fifties and are located in the City of Toronto. They are similar to condominiums, in that units may be bought and sold by private sale or on the open market. Until relatively recently, these units tended to be bought by older people with home equity who could buy the unit outright, as it was difficult to get a mortgage against these units. However, a number of Ontario credit unions are now offering limited financing, provided that that individual co-op corporations meet their fiscal standards, making these units affordable housing options for younger buyers. Incoming owners must be approved by the building's Board of Directors, and agree to abide by building by-laws and Occupancy Agreements.|$|E
500|$|In his {{capacity}} as UGG general counsel, Brownlee {{was responsible for}} its restructuring. [...] Its bylaws provided that only farmers could buy shares directly from the company, but placed no limitation on who could buy them from other shareholders. [...] This {{had the effect of}} limiting capital inflow, since few farmers could afford to buy shares during the depression, and transferring control of the company to non-farmers, who were purchasing shares from impoverished farmers. [...] Brownlee's solution was to create two classes of share: an investment share with a par value of $20, and a <b>voting</b> <b>share</b> with a par value of $5. [...] The former could be held by any person, to a maximum of 250 shares per person, while the latter could be held only by farmers, to a maximum of 25 shares per person.|$|E

40|$|Three vote-share {{equations}} {{are estimated}} and analyzed in this paper, one for presidential elections, one for on-term House elections, {{and one for}} midterm House elections. The sample period is 1916 – 2006. Considering the three equations together allows one to test whether the same economic variables affect each and to examine various serial correlation and coattail possibilities. The resulting three equation model can then be analyzed dynamically, which is done in Section 4. The main conclusions are brie y: 1) There is strong evidence that the economy affects all three <b>vote</b> <b>shares</b> and in remarkably similar ways. 2) There {{is no evidence of}} any presidential coattail effects on the on-term House elections. The presidential <b>vote</b> <b>share</b> and the on-term House <b>vote</b> <b>share</b> are highly positively correlated, but this is because they are affected by some of the same variables. 3) There is positive serial correlation in the House vote in that the previous mid-term House <b>vote</b> <b>share</b> positively affects the on-term House <b>vote</b> <b>share</b> and the previous on-term House <b>vote</b> <b>share</b> positively affects the mid-term House <b>vote</b> <b>share.</b> 4) The presidential <b>vote</b> <b>share</b> has a negative effect on the next mid-term House <b>vote</b> <b>share.</b> The most likely explanation for this is a balance argument, where voters are reluctant to let one party become too dominant.

2500|$|Having {{received}} minimal publicity in {{the previous}} elections, which contributed to the low <b>voting</b> <b>share</b> that the party received, the Libertarian Party gained significant exposure and media attention in the lead-up to the 2012 Libertarian National Convention and the 2012 presidential election, starting with former two term New Mexico governor Gary Johnson's announcement of his presidential run with the Libertarian Party. Using the publicity gained from the announcement, Johnson praised the Libertarian Party and championed their beliefs through interviews and public statements, which were often profane and harshly critical of both the Democratic and Republican parties. [...] Johnson won the nomination at the 2012 Libertarian National Convention running to be more fiscally Conservative than Republican nominee Mitt Romney and more socially liberal than Democratic President Barack Obama. [...] Johnsons's campaign for the presidency focused mostly on keeping the publicity gained by the Libertarian Party and gaining support from independents and dissenting Democratic and Republican voters, often echoing resentment towards the two parties. [...] This included a court challenge against the Commission on Presidential Debates by Johnson that sought to include him in the official presidential election debates.|$|E

Second, the advertising spending of both incumbents and challengers had a significant effect on <b>vote</b> <b>shares,</b> but the effects were greater for challengers than for incumbents.

60|$|We {{may very}} {{conveniently}} divide {{the expansion of}} Rome into four stages. The first stage began after the sack of Rome by the Goths in 390 B.C. and went on {{until the end of}} the First Punic War (240 B.C.). We may call this stage the stage of the Assimilative Republic. It was perhaps the finest, most characteristic stage in Roman history. The age-long dissensions of patrician and plebeian were drawing to it close, the Etruscan threat had come to an end, no one was very rich yet nor very poor, and most men were public-spirited. It was a republic like the republic of the South African Boers before 1900 or like the northern states of the American union between 1800 and 1850; a free-farmers republic. At the outset of this stage Rome was a little state scarcely twenty miles square. She fought the sturdy but kindred states about her, and sought not their destruction but coalescence. Her centuries of civil dissension had trained her people in compromise and concessions. Some of the defeated cities became altogether Roman with a <b>voting</b> <b>share</b> in the government, some became self-governing with the right to trade and marry in Rome; garrisons full of citizens were set up at strategic points and colonies of varied privileges founded among the freshly conquered people. Great roads were made. The rapid Latinization of all Italy was the inevitable consequence of such a policy. In 89 B.C. all the free inhabitants of Italy became citizens of the city of Rome. Formally the whole Roman Empire became at last an extended city. In 212 A.D. every free man in the entire extent of the empire was given citizenship; the right, if he could get there, to vote in the town meeting in Rome.|$|E
