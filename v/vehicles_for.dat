5|$|After the {{original}} {{contract with the}} state was terminated, a new agreement {{for the production of}} 650 vehicles to be delivered between 1948 and 1952 was reached. The state helped production with a significant prepayment of 132 million marks. According to the contract, 150 vehicles were scheduled to be built in 1948. The company reached this target and made a further 11 <b>vehicles</b> <b>for</b> private use. 92 were sold under the name of Sisu S-22 or S-22K and 69 were badged as Vanaja V-48. 101 M2 Half-Tracks were sold.

The company also sold 211 M2 Half-Tracks, allowing it to declare its first profit of 1.208 million marks, which was helped by a devaluation of the Finnish mark.|$|E

The study took into account the manufacturer's suggested retail price, taxes, credits, destination charge, electric charging station, fuel cost, maintenance cost, and additional cost due to the use of a gasoline vehicle for trips beyond the range of the Leaf.|$|E

By midnight on June 9 nearly every freeway and major road in the city was under several feet of water, forcing hundreds of motorists to abandon their <b>vehicles</b> <b>for</b> higher ground. Eighteen-wheeled trucks were filmed floating down major freeways and highways, swept along by floodwaters.|$|E

5|$|The {{changes were}} met with {{critical}} reception in the province. Many students are now required to pay higher sports fees to cover higher transportation costs. Some schools {{do not have access}} to approved vehicles because the Education Act prohibits schools and school districts from owning vehicles.

These require money to buy new vehicles and the required insurance, which often requires schools to conduct extra fundraising.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} of varying coloration either rapidly {{or with the}} changing seasons has military applications. Active camouflage could in theory make use of both dynamic colour change and counterillumination. Simple techniques such as changing uniforms and repainting <b>vehicles</b> <b>for</b> winter have been in use since the Second World War. In 2011, BAE Systems announced their Adaptiv infrared camouflage technology. It uses about 1000 hexagonal panels to cover the sides of a tank. The Peltier plate panels are heated and cooled to match either the vehicle's surroundings (crypsis), or an object such as a car (mimesis), when viewed in infrared.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game takes place underwater. Some pools are inhabited by piranhas that can kill Lara within seconds, while others have streams with currents that can pull her in a fixed direction, preventing the player from being able to swim back or grab onto a ledge. Furthermore, the water in the Antarctica levels is too cold for Lara to swim through {{for more than a few}} seconds. The player can also wade through quicksand, but at the risk of drowning Lara. Some levels require the player to use <b>vehicles.</b> <b>For</b> example, the kayak helps Lara fight her way down rapids in the Madubu Gorge level, while an underwater propeller unit allows her to explore deep water areas in the Lud's Gate level. Other vehicles include a quad bike, a boat, and minecarts. Flares may be used to explore darkened areas. Ammunition, flares, and health recovery items are dispersed among the levels to help players increase their resources. The game also features a tutorial level where the player can practice Lara's moves and combat abilities.|$|E
5|$|After a {{succession}} of counterattacks, {{toward the end of}} August the Libyans finally drove the 400 Chadian soldiers out of the town.

To highlight the victory, Gaddafi flew foreign journalists to the region, so the news of his victory could reach the headlines.|$|E
