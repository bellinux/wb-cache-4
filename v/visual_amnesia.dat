5000|$|In 1883 Jean-Martin Charcot {{encountered}} {{a patient who}} was most likely suffering from posterior cerebral artery thrombosis (not confirmed with autopsy) and {{lost the ability to}} consciously reproduce images from his dreams while awake. While this patient still reported dreams of words, the inability to recall any imagery, termed visual irreminiscence, became the center of Charcot's case study. [...] His resulting contribution to the formulation of the syndrome lies on the lack of ability to re-visualize dream imagery and does not imply their complete absence, but a general state of <b>visual</b> <b>amnesia.</b>|$|E
40|$|WearCam', a {{wearable}} {{multimedia system}} with video processing capability and wireless Internet connection, {{has recently been}} proposed(Mann 1994 b). In this paper, WearCam {{is presented as a}} prosthetic device. In particular, two example applications: the `personal visual assistant'; and the `visual memory prosthetic ' are described. The `personal visual assistant ' embodies a spatial visual filter(Mann 1994 a) that reconfigures the human visual system, providing a coordinate transformation (remapping of spatial coordinates). Such coordinate transformations, it is hoped, might someday be of use to the partially sighted. The `visual memory prosthetic(?) ' embodies a temporal visual filter that provides computerinduced flashbacks (possibly together with annotation). These `flashbacks' currently help the author overcome <b>visual</b> <b>amnesia.</b> It is hoped that, with further research, the apparatus and approach might someday lead to perceptual intelligence that we can wear, and be of great benefit to [...] ...|$|E

40|$|A {{patient had}} a slowly {{developing}} amnesic syndrome that remained substantially unchanged {{during the two}} and a half years of observation. Intellectual skills were excellent and there was no language, perception, praxis, or calculation deficit. The memory impairment involved verbal and visual learning, sparing spatial learning and, to a large extent, retrograde memory. Magnetic resonance imaging was normal, but PET showed a hypometabolism of the left temporal mesial region and thalamus. This case extends the spectrum of monosymptomatic cognitive disorders, previously reported in the area of language, praxis, and <b>visual</b> recognition, to <b>amnesia...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a form of}} amnesia, which we have called <b>visual</b> memory-deficit <b>amnesia,</b> that is caused by damage to areas of the visual system that store visual information. Because it {{is caused by a}} deficit in access to stored visual material and not by an impaired ability to encode or retrieve new material, it has the otherwise infrequent properties of a more severe retrograde than anterograde amnesia with no temporal gradient in the retrograde amnesia. Of the 11 cases of long-term visual memory loss found in the literature, all had amnesia extending beyond a loss of visual memory, often including a near total loss of pretraumatic episodic memory. Of the 6 cases in which both the severity of retrograde and anterograde amnesia and the temporal gradient of the retrograde amnesia were noted, 4 had a more severe retrograde amnesia with no temporal gradient and 2 had a less severe retrograde amnesia with a temporal gradient...|$|R
40|$|Book synopsis: Witness {{presents}} a new {{body of work}} in the field by an international cast of scholars who engage with a complex set of questions concerning notions of witnessing and attestation in twentieth- and twenty-first century Western culture. Providing insight into this vital yet relatively unexplored concept –and the wide range of media and subject areas to which it lends itself – the volume not only establishes links with existing, currently canonical contributions to witness literature – from Primo Levi through Victor Klemperer to Imre Kertész – but also goes on to provide a set of analyses of exemplary and very recent literary works in that area. Furthermore, Witness extends and changes the previous scholarly tendency to focus strongly on historical evidence and the witness’s vocalization of true remembrance so as to include difficult theoretical and interpretative questions posed by studies today of traumatic experience, <b>amnesia,</b> <b>visual</b> culture, new media, and technology. The book includes contributions from the acclaimed Romanian-German author Herta Müller, Nobel laureate of literature 2009, and Cathy Caruth, the internationally recognized scholar in trauma studies...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Fifty-eight {{patients}} with a unilateral infarction in the superficial area supplied by aposterior cerebral artery were followed (mean: 39 - 6 months). Thirteen (22. 4 %) developed corticalblindness associated with a delayed contralateral occipital infarction. Advanced age, general vascular risk, a history of strokes, Sylvian border-zone extension of the initial infarct, and an absence of improvement of initial visual field defects were strongly associated with spread to the other side. The lack of visual field improvement most accurately predicted {{a high risk of}} corticalblindness. A careful follow-up and controlled medical therapy is particularly indicated in thesepatients. Cortical blindness is defined as the partial or complete loss of vision from bilateral occipital infarction often associated with disorientation, <b>amnesia,</b> <b>visual</b> fabu-lations, and denial of blindness. 1 - 3 We examined the question why infarcts in the areas of the posterior cerebral arteries occur bilaterally in some patients and remain unilateral in others. Patients and methods We studied 58 cases of infarction in the superficial area of a posterior cerebral artery (31 left, 27 right, 39 male, 19 female, average age 59 years). Two patients showed alexi...|$|R
