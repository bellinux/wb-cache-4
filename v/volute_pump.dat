In this paper, a special slope volute was proposed to reduce vibration level of centrifugal pump. The goal of this paper was to analyze vibration characteristics of slope <b>volute</b> <b>pump</b> and provide a new method to reduce vibration energy in centrifugal pump. Experiments were carried out to obtain vibration signals at different flow rates of slope <b>volute</b> <b>pump,</b> which were compared with conventional spiral <b>volute</b> <b>pump.</b> Results show that vibration level is closely related to flow structure interior pump. At low flow rates, especially, vibration energy increases rapidly with the onset of rotating stall. Rotor-stator interaction mechanism changes when adopting slope volute. In slope <b>volute</b> <b>pump,</b> the peaks in power spectra correspond to different harmonics of fBPF at three measuring directions; however, in spiral <b>volute</b> <b>pump,</b> the predominant components always correspond to 2 fBPF. From comparison of vibration level in different frequency bands, it is found that vibration level of slope <b>volute</b> <b>pump</b> is smaller than conventional spiral <b>volute</b> <b>pump.</b> So vibration energy of centrifugal pump can be reduced effectively using slope volute...|$|E

Blade-to-blade radial and tangential velocity profiles at the impeller exit are presented and compared to data for a similar single <b>volute</b> <b>pump.</b> Flow rates ranged from 40 % of design flow to the design point. The blade-to-blade profiles were more uniform than for the single <b>volute</b> <b>pump.</b> Also, the average circumferential variations for the double <b>volute</b> <b>pump</b> were more symmetric than for the single <b>volute</b> <b>pump.</b> For the double volute geometry measurements indicate that radial inward flow (recirculation) was only present for flow rates below 60 % of design flow, compared to 80 % of design flow for the single <b>volute</b> <b>pump.</b> Velocity data was also used to determine volute losses, slip factor, and momentum contributions to the impeller radial forces. Volute losses were quantified and shown to increase for flow rates below 80 % of design flow and were approximately 10 % of the developed head at 40 % flow. The efficiency in the double volute compared to the single volute shows decreased performance for flows above 55 % of design flow, which is attributed to increased boundary layer friction; at low flow rates increased performance is ascribed to better control over the recirculation regions. Slip factors were symmetric around the volute but were lower than for a single <b>volute</b> <b>pump.</b> Finally, momentum contributions to the total impeller radial load were shown to be maximum at the design point, contributing 40 % of the force developed by the pressure distribution; the significance diminished at lower flow rates and the contribution was negligible at 40 % of the design flow...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The low lying {{parts of}} Holland are {{vulnerable}} to flooding and are therefore heavily protected by dykes and several pumping stations. These however cause serious obstacles to migratory fish. Pumping stations can be lethal barriers for fish migration. Currently a lot of pump manufacturers are developing new fish friendly pumps. To fit these new pumps in existing pumping stations, usually civil adjustments are required at considerable costs. A more cost effective alternative would be to perform a fish friendly upgrade of the existing pumps. During the last 3 years Flowserve conducted excessive research to increase their knowledge on fish friendly pump design. This research project led to a comprehensive calculation method to predict survivability rates of fish passing pumps. With this knowledge Flowserve has developed a very cost effective retrofit program to upgrade existing pumping stations equiped with fish unfriendly concrete <b>volute</b> <b>pumps</b> that have open axial flow screw impellers, also known as BVOP pumps.

A numerical algorithm was developed to calculate the two-dimensional flow through a centrifugal <b>volute</b> <b>pump,</b> {{taking into account the}} width variation of the volute in the axial direction and the vortex wakes downstream of the impeller blades by a linearized vortex distribution. The pressure field was obtained from the unsteady Bernoulli equation, with the entire configuration of the pump being included in the calculations. For that purpose the computational domain was split into a region containing the rotor and one containing the stationary parts, each region being treated in a different co-ordinate system. The corresponding finite element grids are matched by an interface consisting of connect elements which move with time. The method is applied to a laboratory centrifugal pump set up at the Von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics, which made an experimental validation possible. The total head of the pump and the velocity and pressure fields were computed and analysed for various mass flows. The agreement with the experimental data was satisfactory. The deviation was largest at low mass flow, the maximum deviation in the velocity around the impeller being 10 per cent. The overall behaviour of the pump could be well predicted.

The present experimental results are obtained using the magnetic bearing test rig that was designed to measure the forces and moments that result from the hydrodynamic interactions in a centrifugal pump under various operating conditions. The comparison is presented between the results for the single stage pump obtained by the traditional methods and those derived from magnetic bearing reactions. The results are given for the full range of flowrates from shutoff to runout and a Reynolds number effect is also examined for semiopen impellers. The information obtained will be used to design new industrial pumps...|$|E

The casting process design principle, process parameters, points of attention, and the simulation parameters were introduced. Huazhu CAE was used to simulate the casting process. The STL document used in Huazhu CAE was converted from the 3 D moulding of the casting process using the Solidwork software. The simulation results and practical production showed that the casting process can reduce shrinkage defects of the casting...|$|R

40|$|Pressure {{pulsations}} may be troublesome {{during the}} operation and performance of centrifugal pumps. Such pressure pulsations have traditionally been investigated experimentally but numerical analysis techniques allow these effects to be explored. The multi-block, structured grid CFD code TASCflow {{has been used to}} investigate the time variation of pressure within a complete double entry, double <b>volute</b> centrifugal <b>pump.</b> This investigation has taken the form of a parametric study covering four geometric parameters, namely the cutwater gap, vane arrangement, snubber gap and the sidewall clearance. Taguchi methods allowed the number of transient analyses to be limited to a total of 27. Three flow rates were investigated and the pulsations were extracted at 15 different locations covering important pump regions. Taguchi post-processing analysis tools were used to rank the relative importance of the four geometric parameters at each location for each flow rate. The cutwater gap and vane arrangement were found to exert the greatest influence across the various monitored locations and the flow range. A rationalisation process aimed at increased component life and reduced noise/vibration through reductions in pressure pulsations has produced geometric recommendations, which should be useful to designers...|$|R
