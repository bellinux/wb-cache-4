30|$|A {{return to}} timber {{as a major}} {{building}} material is especially attractive since each cubic meter of wood can store half tonne of carbon [67]. Can we make buildings that work like trees and cities like forests? New cities will exploit new materials that will deliver greater functionality. For example nano-materials already offer opportunities for advances in sensors [68] and smart polymers [69]. However, {{it is just as}} important that future cities are constructed from materials that are completely recyclable and sustainable [70]. Where <b>virgin</b> <b>feedstock</b> is required it must be taken from renewable sources, which in many instances will be biomass-based [71]. For health and safety reasons manufacturing processes are currently located at distances from major conurbations. In the future processes are required that are low hazard and can be integrated into cities, close to workers homes. The newly emergent disciplines of Green Chemistry and Green Engineering are addressing the development of future manufacturing industry [72].|$|E
40|$|Waste biomass as a {{mean for}} global carbon dioxide {{emissions}} mitigation remains under-utilized. This is mainly due to the low calorific value of <b>virgin</b> <b>feedstock,</b> characterized generally with high moisture content. Aqueous processing, namely hydrothermal liquefaction in subcritical water conditions, has been demonstrated experimentally to thermally densify solid lignocellulose into liquid fuels without the pre-requisite and energy consuming drying step. This study presents a techno-economic evaluation of an integrated hydrothermal liquefaction system with downstream {{combined heat and power}} production from forest residues. The utilization of the liquefaction by-products and waste heat from the elevated processing conditions, coupled with the chemical upgrading of the feedstock enables the poly-generation of biocrude, electricity and district heat. The plant thermal efficiency increases by 3. 5 to 4. 6 % compared to the conventional direct combustion case. The economic assessment showed that the minimum selling price of biocrude, based on present co-products market prices, hinders commercialization and ranges between 138 EUR to 178 EUR per MWh. A sensitivity analysis and detailed discussion on the techno-economic assessment results are presented for the different process integration and market case scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Issue: Fiber {{composite}} panelboard mills {{were originally}} designed and constructed to use <b>virgin</b> wood <b>feedstocks</b> as a raw material. Some of the virgin wood fiber {{used for the}} panelboard mills are from low value roundwood. This wood fiber is too small, an undesirable species or too defective for solid wood manufacturing. The remaining <b>virgin</b> <b>feedstocks</b> are typically derived from the residual chips produced by primary wood products manufacturers (sawmills and plywood plants) that use round logs for their raw material. The virgin wood fiber is generally free of non-wood contaminants and relatively uniform in specie, geometry, color, and moisture content. Millions of tons a year of such residuals are generated. The feedstocks produced from wood waste for the panelboard mills are more complex. They frequently contain various quantities of non-wood contaminants, consist {{of a number of}} different species (softwood and hardwood varieties), lack uniform geometry, include weathered wood colors, and might vary significantly in moisture content (green wood to kiln dried). These complex characteristics are a challenge for the panelboard industry because their production systems were not originally designed to account for these feedstock variations. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends the implementation of certain processing techniques at panelboard plants when substituting waste wood derived feedstocks for a portion of the raw materia...|$|R
40|$|Issue: Pulp {{and paper}} {{industry}} were originally designed and constructed to use <b>virgin</b> wood <b>feedstocks</b> as a raw material. Some of the virgin wood fiber {{used for the}} {{pulp and paper industry}} is from lower value roundwood logs that are chipped for pulping. The other major source is from the residuals from sawmill, veneer, and lumber plants. These solid wood production plants produce millions of tons a year of residual barks, chips, and sawdust that they cannot use but can be used for pulping. This wood fiber is too small, or too defective for solid wood manufacturing. The remaining <b>virgin</b> <b>feedstocks</b> are typically derived from the residual chips produced by primary wood products manufacturers (sawmills and plywood plants) that rely on the round log for their raw material. The virgin wood fiber is generally free of non-wood contaminants and relatively uniform in specie, geometry, color, and moisture content. The feedstocks produced from wood waste for the pulp and paper industry are more complex.

40|$|The {{environmental}} burden of collecting recoverables from households is generally omitted from life-cycle analyses comparing the environmental outcome of using secondary material from post-consumer waste (PCW) with <b>virgin</b> <b>feedstock.</b> However, this burden can be considerable, {{depending upon the}} characteristics of the collection methods employed. Given that the basic objective of recycling is to secure environmental benefits, it is vital that the burden of collection through both bring/dropoff and kerbside schemes is taken into account if a valid assessment of the environmental balance resulting from PCW recycling is to be made. This paper presents survey data comparing the burden of collection for different types of recycling provision. It describes the site and spatial characteristics determining the amount of transport dedicated to collection at bring/drop-off sites. Predictor variables are identified as measures of these characteristics, and the survey data compared with them. A regression model to assess energy use at bring/drop-off sites with varying characteristics is then developed. The potential uses of the techniques presented include the evaluation of the {{environmental burden}}s of recycling provision at the waste collection authority and regional level, allowing more informed choices {{to be made in the}} development of recycling provision from an environmental standpoint. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{recycling}} {{for recovery}} and reuse {{of material and}} energy resources undoubtedly provides a substantial alternative supply of raw materials and reduces the dependence on <b>virgin</b> <b>feedstock.</b> The main objective {{of this study was}} to assess the potential of dry municipal solid waste recycling in Mashhad city, Iran. Several questionnaires were prepared and distributed among various branches of the municipality, related organizations and people. The total amount of solid waste generated in Mashhad in 2008 was 594 800 tons with per capita solid waste generation rate of 0. 609 kg person 1 day 1. Environmental educational programmes via mass media and direct education of civilians were implemented to publicize the advantages and necessity of recycling. The amount of recycled dry solid waste was increased from 2. 42 % of total dry solid waste (2588. 36 ton year 1) in 1999 to 7. 22 % (10 165 ton year 1) in 2008. The most important fractions of recycled dry solid waste in Mashhad included paper and board (51. 33 %), stale bread (14. 59 %), glass (9. 73 %), ferrous metals (9. 73 %), plastic (9. 73 %), polyethylene terephthalate (2. 62 %) and non-ferrous metals (0. 97 %). It can be concluded that unfortunately the potential of dry solid waste recycling in Mashhad has not been considered properly and there is a great effort to be made in order to achieve the desired conditions of recycling...|$|E

At the position of micrometer-scaled prebreakdown sites, which correlate with recombination active defects found along grain boundaries, micro-x-ray fluorescence mappings revealed the presence of Fe precipitate colonies. These measurements represent direct evidence that transition metal clusters lead to decreased breakdown voltage and cause soft diode breakdown...|$|R
40|$|Polyethylene {{encapsulation}} is a {{waste treatment}} technology developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory using thermoplastic polymers to safely and effectively solidify hazardous, radioactive and mixed wastes for disposal. Over 13 years of development and demonstration with surrogate wastes as well as actual waste streams on both bench and full scale have shown {{this to be a}} viable and robust technology with wide application. Process development efforts have previously focused on the use of <b>virgin</b> polymer <b>feedstocks.</b> In order to potentially improve process economics and serve to lessen the municipal waste burden, recycled polymers were investigated for use as encapsulating agents. Recycled plastics included low-density polyethylene, linear low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene and polypropylene, and were used as a direct substitute for or blended together with virgin resin. Impacts on processing and final waste form performance were examined...|$|R
