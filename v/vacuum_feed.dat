Flow rate, however, could only increase the permeate if it was increased from 37. 5 to 50 ml/s.

The objective of this thesis was to investigate the impact of an increased vacuum distillation tower bottoms feed fraction on the reactor fluid dynamics (e. g., bed and freeboard phase holdups, bubble characteristics and local fluidization behaviour). Industrial conditions were simulated in a high pressure gas-liquid-solid fluidization system based on dimensional and geometric similitude. Considering important geometric characteristics and matching dimensionless groups, base-case conditions resulted in an ebullated bed of nitrogen, 0. 5 wt. % aqueous ethanol, and aluminum cylinders (average lengths and diameters of 7. 5 and 3. 2 mm, respectively) operating at 6. 5 MPa and a gas-to-liquid superficial velocity ratio of 0. 78. The proposed scale-down method resulted in high gas holdup conditions similar to industrial measurements. The use of the Sauter mean diameter to account for particle size and shape at the simulation conditions was investigated by comparing glass spheres with diameters of 4 and 1. 5 mm to aluminum cylinders with equivalent volume-to-surface area ratios. Local bubble characteristics, including gas holdups, bubble rise velocities, and chord lengths, were then investigated under various operating conditions using a monofibre optical probe. Overall fluid dynamics were studied when increasing the liquid viscosity and varying the gas and liquid superficial velocities due to their relevance for industrial ebullated bed hydroprocessors.

Compared to vacuum pervaporation, on which many researchers have focused, sweep gas pervaporation has received little attention. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse opportunities for integrating and optimising both process layouts for the treatment of wastewater. The focus was on hollow fibre modules. Two module configurations of hollow fibre modules were considered: (1) shell-side and (2) tube-side feed flow. An advanced simulation program based on a phenomenological/semi-empirical model was used. The influence of (1) process parameters such as permeate pressure and the size of the sweep stream per module, and of (2) module design parameters such as void fraction or module configuration was determined for two model substances pyridine and phenol. Based on the simulations, guidelines for the optimisation of pervaporation are presented. These include the observation that for <b>vacuum</b> pervaporation shell-side <b>feed</b> flow is superior, whilst for sweep gas pervaporation tube-side feed flow should be selected. In the former case and for a given feed rate per module, the void fraction within the module should be selected as low as possible to reduce the effect of concentration polarisation. This approach is, however, limited by the pressure resistance of packed fibres causing an increasing pressure gradient on the feed side. For hydrophobic pervaporation of wastewater, sweep gas pervaporation should be combined with a moderate vacuum (of around 0. 1 bar) to improve the pervaporation performance; the performance at atmospheric pressure for the conditions selected leads to excessive membrane areas. Similar to vacuum pervaporation the void fraction should be selected as high as possible for tube-side feed flow, and as low as possible for shell-side feed flow...|$|R
