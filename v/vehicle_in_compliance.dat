What is the probability that MRSA is applied by the patient on contact surfaces <b>in</b> ambulance <b>vehicles</b> <b>in</b> <b>compliance</b> with an infection control concept and what are risk contact surfaces <b>in</b> the ambulance <b>vehicle?</b> We studied defined contact surfaces in 30 ambulances after transport of a MRSA positive patients. In the control group 15 ambulances were examined after transport with unknown MRSA status. The sampling was carried out before the final disinfection, genotyping of MRSA strains were carried out within the Euregio MRSA-net project. In three transports with known MRSA status of the patient we found on four contact surfaces <b>in</b> the <b>vehicles</b> a nosocomial MRSA strain with the same genotype of previously transported patient. In the control group, we detected an incidental finding of a nosocomial MRSA strain on the disinfectant dispenser. The risk areas identified were all close to the patient and all hand-related areas of the staff. All sampling was carried out before the final disinfection. In 10 % MRSA is transmitted from patient to near patient and all hand contact surfaces <b>in</b> the ambulance <b>vehicle.</b> A targeted disinfection, as well as an infection control concept are sufficient to eliminate MRSA transmission on contact surfaces <b>in</b> the ambulance <b>vehicle...</b>|$|R
50|$|Mitsubishi MCA {{stands for}} Mitsubishi Clean Air, a moniker used in Japan to {{identify}} vehicles built with emission control technology. The term {{was first introduced}} in Japan, with later introductions internationally. The technology first appeared in January 1973 on the Mitsubishi 4G32A gasoline-powered inline four cylinder engine installed <b>in</b> all Mitsubishi <b>vehicles</b> using the 4G32 engine, and the Saturn-6 6G34 six-cylinder gasoline-powered engine installed in the Mitsubishi Debonair.

50|$|While the 13B {{produced}} {{more power than}} the Red series motors that powered the equivalent Holdens, the lack of torque meant performance was restrained with a 166 km/h top speed, poor acceleration and terrible fuel consumption. Contemporary reports suggest 9 mpg (26 L per 100 km). The <b>vehicle</b> was not <b>in</b> <b>compliance</b> with Japanese regulations concerning engine displacement and exterior dimensions, and was classed in the mid-size car segment, while the engine displacement placed it in the lower annual road tax brackets. If the car was recognized as being for business use as an executive company car, the road tax bill was very minimal.|$|R
50|$|Holden in Australia {{launched}} the XC series Combo in September 2002. It offered the 1.6 litre Z16SE engine, upgraded to 1.4 litre Z14XEP specification in December 2004 for the MY05 update.

50|$|NAPS {{stands for}} Nissan Anti Pollution System a moniker used in Japan to {{identify}} vehicles built with emission control technology. The technology was installed {{so that their}} <b>vehicles</b> would be <b>in</b> <b>compliance</b> with Japanese Government emission regulations passed in 1968. The term was first introduced in Japan, with an externally mounted badge on the trunk of vehicles equipped. Nissan's implementation began with the Y44E V8 engine installed in the Nissan President along with all vehicles installed with the Nissan L engine and the Nissan A engine in 1975. The initial introduction of Nissan's technology was the installation of an exhaust gas recirculation valve, followed {{with the addition of}} a catalytic converter and an air pump that added oxygen into the exhaust to promote higher temperatures in the catalytic converter, thus cleaning the exhaust further.|$|R
50|$|Toyota TTC {{stands for}} Toyota Total Clean System, a moniker used in Japan to {{identify}} vehicles built with emission control technology. The technology was installed {{so that their}} <b>vehicles</b> would be <b>in</b> <b>compliance</b> with Japanese Government emission regulations passed in 1968. The term was first introduced in Japan, with an externally mounted badge on the trunk of vehicles equipped. The technology first appeared in January 1975 on the Toyota Crown, the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Carina, the Toyota Corolla, and the Toyota Sprinter. There were three different versions initially introduced, called TTC-C for Catalyst, installing a catalytic converter, TTC-V for Vortex, installing an exhaust gas recirculation valve, and TTC-L which used a lean burn method. As Toyota's technology evolved the three systems were eventually incorporated together in future models.|$|R

50|$|The Volkswagen Golf Mk3 is a {{small family}} car, the third {{generation}} of the Volkswagen Golf and the successor to the Volkswagen Golf Mk2. It was launched in mainland Europe in August 1991, in the United Kingdom in February 1992, and in North America {{in the spring of}} 1994. The delay in North America was due to Volkswagen's decision to supply U.S. and Canadian dealerships with Mk3 Golfs (and A3 Jettas) from the VW plant in Puebla, Mexico. Quality control problems led Volkswagen of America to reject Golfs and Jettas from Mexico; shortly thereafter labor unrest at the plant delayed production there even further. The third-generation Golf and Jetta first appeared in North America as 1993 models in the San Diego, California area and in Canada, then in the autumn in the rest of North America as 1994 models. The Mk3 Cabrio replaced the Volkswagen Cabriolet, which continued the original Golf until 1993, although the original Golf, sold as Rabbit in the United States and Canada ceased sales in 1984. The Mk3 Cabrio continued until the 2002 model year, when Volkswagen replaced it with a convertible version of the Volkswagen New Beetle. The Mk3 was sold in Japan alongside the Polo, where both <b>vehicles</b> were <b>in</b> <b>compliance</b> with Japanese Government dimension regulations that encouraged sales. A 1993 UK advert featured the Bluebells song Young At Heart which resulted in a 4-week spell at Number 1 thanks to the popularity of it.|$|R

50|$|On 17 October 2006, Mitsubishi {{launched}} {{the second generation}} model, dropping the Airtrek in Japan in favour of adopting the global name. It features a new DOHC 2.4 L 16-valve MIVEC engine; INVECS-III continuously variable transmission (CVT), Mitsubishi's AWC system which features electronically controlled four wheel drive and stability control, on a stretched Mitsubishi GS platform. The North American version, powered by a newly designed 6B31 3.0 L V6 SOHC MIVEC was shown in April 2006 at the New York Auto Show prior to its release in October the same year. Due to {{the availability of a}} V6 engine, Mitsubishi returned to offering a shorter version of this vehicle, and reintroduced the Mitsubishi RVR 17 February 2010. The usage of a four-cylinder engine under 2.0 liters offers Japanese buyers a <b>vehicle</b> that was <b>in</b> <b>compliance</b> with Japanese regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement, which has tax advantages, giving buyers the ability to purchase a vehicle capable of seating seven people without paying the tax penalty of a larger engine.|$|R

40|$|For {{better or}} worse, {{we live in}} a society {{dominated}} by the automobile; Americans are notoriously dependent on automobiles for access to goods and services, for social and economic development, and for sustenance. In disaster situations, transportation can be critical to individual and household recovery efforts, particularly for those in areas with no public transportation or where public transportation has been disrupted. FEMA’s statutory mandate charges the agency with “alleviat[ing] the suffering and damage,” and unsurprisingly, this mandate encompasses disruptions to local transportation systems; the agency’s statutes and regulations authorize FEMA to provide financial aid for transportation needs, including repair or replacement of disaster–damaged personal vehicles. But to be eligible, FEMA requires proof of an applicant’s auto accident liability insurance—despite the fact that such insurance would not have covered the damaged vehicle. The only plausible policy reason given for this rule is that FEMA will not provide aid for <b>vehicles</b> not <b>in</b> <b>compliance</b> with state law. However, state mandatory insurance laws exist to reduce the numbers of uninsured motorists, a goal with little, if any, discernible relationship to FEMA’s mission of disaster relief. Moreover, most uninsured vehicles are owned by low-income households, and the postdisaster punitive effect on uninsured disaster survivors could violate FEMA’s antidiscrimination provisions, which include protections on the basis of economic status. What is more, auto insurance mandates are of dubious efficacy—raising more questions about the eligibility requirement. This Article examines and critiques the FEMA auto insurance mandate in light of the agency’s mission and history, and the mandate to alleviate disaster-related economic harms to low-income families. Further, this Article considers both the policy arguments and the potential for successful challenges to the policy through litigation or agency procedures...|$|R
40|$|The Advance Warning System (AWS), {{developed}} by the Nebraska Department of Roads (NDOR) {{has proven to be}} effective at improving traffic safety at isolated signalized intersections. However, the effectiveness of the system has not been analyzed at signalized intersections operating in a coordinated mode. This project analyzed AWS on arterials where the signals operate in a coordinated mode. The test bed consisted of nine sites, which are located at five successive coordinated signalized intersections on Highway 281 in Grand Island, Nebraska. A non-intrusive data collection system was used to collect a continuous traffic stream of data up to 1200 ft upstream of the stop-line at a given intersection. The analysis showed that with the AWS, the dilemma zone entrapment rate was, on average, 81 % smaller than what would have been expected if the AWS was not installed. The accelerating/decelerating analysis showed that 94 % of the average acceleration/deceleration rates were within the comfortable range, 69. 7 % of the vehicles slowed down after the start of the AWS signal, and 92. 1 % of vehicles slowed down after the start of amber. The red-light running analysis showed that the percentage of red-light running occurrence ranged from 0. 9 % to 2. 0 %, with an average of 1. 5 % and a standard deviation of 0. 4 %. These results indicated that most of the <b>vehicles</b> were <b>in</b> <b>compliance.</b> The simulation-based conflict analysis showed that, on average, there was a 55 %, 12 %, and 51 % reduction in rear-end, lane-change, and crossing conflicts, respectively, for all nine sites, when the AWS system was applied. The overall results suggested that the AWS was effective at alerting drivers to the impending end of the green signal, which resulted in a reduction of conflicts and a safer corridor...|$|R

30|$|Thus, {{attributing}} differences <b>in</b> <b>compliance</b> among {{companies to}} differences <b>in</b> the <b>compliance</b> program companies have is difficult, as individual {{elements of the}} <b>compliance</b> program differ <b>in</b> their design. But, variation <b>in</b> <b>compliance</b> among companies is also due to the demographic composition of the company’s staff, its prevailing ethical culture, and size (O’Fallon and Butterfield 2005). Further, it is attributable situational elements, e.g., the temptation involved (Schwartz 2001), a fact which might account for differences among business units and functions within a company but also among companies from different economic sectors. All this {{makes it difficult to}} compare compliance levels among companies in a way, which would allow attributing differences <b>in</b> <b>compliance</b> to differences <b>in</b> <b>compliance</b> programs.
