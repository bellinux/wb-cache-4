5|$|Dixon is {{accepted}} into the lacrosse team after trying out, but gets into a fight with team member George Evans (Kellan Lutz). Annie tells Dixon of her invitation to Naomi's party, and how she saw Ethan cheating on Naomi. The next day at school, Annie finds out that Silver made a <b>video</b> <b>blog</b> about her, depicting her as a bitchy farmer. Annie confronts Silver, who felt insulted by Annie's decision {{to hang out with}} Naomi. When Silver is reprimanded by her half-sister, Kelly, she realizes that she shouldn't reprimand Annie for what happened between her and Naomi in the past. Elsewhere, Ethan is forced by his team members to lie that Dixon started the fight during, and he is subsequently kicked off the team. Annie argues with Ethan because of his lying, and asks what happened to the Ethan that she met two years ago. In class, Naomi reads an exact copy of Annie's paper. Afterward, when Annie confronts Naomi, she apologizes by giving Annie an $800 dress. Annie decides to watch the school play rehearsals, and Silver apologizes for the video by asking the drama teacher to let Annie sing with the chorus for the play. Much to Adrianna's dismay, Annie is allowed to be in the play. Naomi again gets into trouble when Harry discovers that she cheated, and forces her to write the paper in his office. Ethan has a fight with George and tells the truth, resulting in Dixon being allowed to play on the team. Dixon tells Annie that he feels horrible, as he sent a text message to Naomi telling her that Ethan is cheating on her.|$|E

30|$|This {{case study}} {{provides}} a valuable insight into students’ perceptions of <b>video</b> <b>blogging.</b> Analysing the data using aspects of Kearney’s framework for student-generated digital storytelling (Kearney, 2011) revealed important insights {{that can be}} used to enhance subsequent iterations of the <b>video</b> <b>blogging</b> activity, most notably the need to help students both appreciate the value of critically reflecting on their own <b>video</b> <b>blogs</b> and learn how to go about this. The findings support the conclusions of Blomberg et al. (2014) regarding the importance of using learner-generated video as part of a broader instructional strategy if the benefits to student learning are to be maximised. The data analysis also indicated that <b>video</b> <b>blogging</b> has the potential to support an authentic, student-centred pedagogy, although further research would aim to clarify how best to articulate the benefits of <b>video</b> <b>blogging</b> for their professional development.|$|R

30|$|Although the {{generalisability}} of {{this research}} is limited, the findings identify several benefits of using learner-generated video to achieve a more student-centred pedagogy. Further research would aim to explore ways of helping students think more critically about the value of <b>video</b> <b>blogging</b> in order to approach the creation of <b>video</b> <b>blogs</b> from a more informed perspective. There is also potential to develop a model for the use of learner-generated <b>video</b> <b>blogs</b> to support critical reflection in disciplines beyond teacher education, and this would be of value in helping educators leverage the full potential of learner-generated video as student-centred instructional practice.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{benefits}} and challenges of using <b>video</b> <b>blogging</b> to support reflection and assessment in acting and performance training. A video platform called Acclaim was integrated into the university’s virtual learning environment (Blackboard), enabling students to record and share their performances in an online setting. A key feature of the platform was the ability to add time-based comments on a video, {{making it possible for}} tutors and students to discuss and critique specific moments of each performance. Students were also required to record and upload regular <b>video</b> <b>blogs</b> during which they would reflect on their progress. At {{the end of the first}} year, a survey was designed to evaluate students’ experiences of the <b>video</b> <b>blogging</b> activity. The findings indicate mixed results: while many students viewed <b>video</b> <b>blogging</b> as a useful learning activity, they also identified a number of challenges that hampered its effectiveness. From this study we conclude that while <b>video</b> <b>blogging</b> presents several notable advantages for the facilitation of performance-based courses, the technology needs to be carefully introduced as part of a broader instructional strategy to maximise the potential benefits for student learning and engagement.|$|R

As part of his [...] "Brotherhood 2.0" [...] project, author John Green featured Oobi in an installment of his <b>video</b> <b>blog</b> series Vlogbrothers. In a humorous sketch, the show's title character demonstrated how to write a book proposal alongside a sock puppet.

Although the ear is mailed to forensics and proven to be real, police quickly discover that Willow and Holden placed an online advertisement seeking actors to play kidnapper roles; they soon identify actor Reggie Luckman (Pedro Pascal) {{as one of the}} kidnappers in the WeepingWillow17 videos. Yet another vlog is released, this time with Holden escaping his bonds and shooting one of the kidnappers, before being shot himself by Reggie. Police come to the scene and find Holden alive, along with the dead body of one of the supposed kidnappers named Todd (Trevor Oswalt). Holden insisted the on-camera shooting was fake, and that Reggie shot Todd over a dispute over money after the video was filmed. Holden says the kidnapping videos started as a hoax, but that Reggie has now actually kidnapped Willow.|$|E
500|$|In 2009 Peggy ran as an {{independent}} candidate in the local council elections against Archie's wishes. Writers wanted a storyline that allowed Peggy {{to stand up for}} her beliefs, and felt that running for local government would allow her to speak passionately about the community. After a scene showed Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) asking Peggy, [...] "Where would Tony Blair have been without Alastair Campbell?", Campbell responded by giving advice to Peggy in a <b>video</b> <b>blog.</b> A response from Peggy was then recorded, thanking Campbell for his input. Peggy pulled out of the election at Archie's request ahead of their wedding, however the storyline set up a later episode in which Boris Johnson, Mayor of London made a guest appearance in EastEnders. On 1 October 2009, Johnson appeared in the show as himself, visiting Walford and The Queen Victoria and conversing with Peggy. Johnson commented on his appearance: [...] "It was, of course, a tremendous honour to step inside that most venerable of London landmarks, The Queen Vic, and share a scene with another of the capital's icons, the fabulous Barbara Windsor." [...] Executive producer Diederick Santer stated: [...] "We couldn't let the visit pass without the Mayor entering London's most famous pub, The Queen Vic, and meeting its formidable and politically active landlady Peggy Mitchell." [...] The episode was watched by 8 million viewers, winning EastEnders a 38% audience share in the timeslot.|$|E

30|$|The data {{revealed}} that students rarely {{took the time}} to re-watch the videos they themselves had uploaded (an average score of 1.81 for question 6). Indeed, the data indicated that <b>video</b> <b>blogging</b> did not motivate students to learn more about their subject (question 9, mean average 2.16) and was instead perceived rather as just another task to be completed. This finding was strengthened by the responses to the question regarding whether <b>video</b> <b>blogging</b> was a poor use of their time (mean average of 3.10). As critical reflection is only possible through revisiting and rethinking about one’s own practice, the findings suggest that students require more support to help them reflect effectively on their learning. Students were generally neutral about the pedagogical benefits of <b>video</b> <b>blogging,</b> with most of the key questions on testing its value of <b>video</b> <b>blogging</b> returning scores of between 2.42 and 2.60.|$|R

30|$|The strongest {{opinion was}} on the ease-of-use of Acclaim as a {{platform}} for <b>video</b> <b>blogging.</b> While the survey demonstrated the highest mean value (3.95) and a relatively small deviation (1.00) in opinion, we think the survey is limited in having follow up questions about video annotation tools in particular, and newer technologies in general. Indeed, the second strongest opinion in the survey was that students were very comfortable in working with new technologies (question 3, mean 3.71). Students who scored 2 and lower on question 3 reported lower levels of satisfaction with the <b>video</b> <b>blogging</b> exercises, suggesting that the more comfortable the students were with new technologies, the more positively they responded to <b>video</b> <b>blogging</b> activities.|$|R
