5|$|Norton Internet Security 2000, {{released}} January 10, 2000, was Symantec's {{first foray}} beyond <b>virus</b> <b>protection</b> and content control filters. Its release followed an alliance between Internet provider Excite@Home and antivirus vendor McAfee.com to provide Internet subscribers with McAfee's new firewall software, McAfee Personal Firewall. Version 2000s firewall, based on AtGuard from WRQ, filters traffic at the packet level. It can block ActiveX controls and Java applets. Other functionalities include cookie removal, and banner ad blocking. ZDNet found the ad blocker removed graphics {{that were not}} ads, breaking pages. Adjusting the settings fixed the problem, however the process was complicated. ZDNet noted {{the lack of information}} presented concerning attacks the firewall blocked. Norton LiveUpdate downloads and installs program updates.|$|E

25|$|Network {{firewalls}} prevent unknown {{programs and}} processes from accessing the system. However, {{they are not}} antivirus systems and make no attempt to identify or remove anything. They may protect against infection from outside the protected computer or network, and limit the activity of any malicious software which is present by blocking incoming or outgoing requests on certain TCP/IP ports. A firewall is designed to deal with broader system threats that come from network connections into the system and is not an alternative to a <b>virus</b> <b>protection</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Research from {{security}} company Trend Micro lists premium service {{abuse as}} {{the most common type}} of Android malware, where text messages are sent from infected phones to premium-rate telephone numbers without the consent or even knowledge of the user. Other malware displays unwanted and intrusive advertisements on the device, or sends personal information to unauthorised third parties. Security threats on Android are reportedly growing exponentially; however, Google engineers have argued that the malware and virus threat on Android is being exaggerated by security companies for commercial reasons, and have accused the security industry of playing on fears to sell <b>virus</b> <b>protection</b> software to users. Google maintains that dangerous malware is actually extremely rare, and a survey conducted by F-Secure showed that only 0.5% of Android malware reported had come from the Google Play store.|$|E
25|$|Children and {{adolescents}} often use the Internet (including social media) in ways which risk their privacy: {{a cause for}} growing concern among parents. Young people also may not realise that all their information and browsing can and may be tracked while visiting a particular site, {{and that it is}} up to them to protect their own privacy. They must be informed about all these risks. For example, on Twitter, threats include shortened links that lead one to potentially harmful places. In their e-mail inbox, threats include email scams and attachments that get them to install malware and disclose personal information. On Torrent sites, threats include malware hiding in video, music, and software downloads. Even when using a smartphone, threats include geolocation, meaning that one's phone can detect where they are and post it online for all to see. Users can protect themselves by updating <b>virus</b> <b>protection,</b> using security settings, downloading patches, installing a firewall, screening e-mail, shutting down spyware, controlling cookies, using encryption, fending off browser hijackers, and blocking pop-ups.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlthough the {{interaction}} between phages and bacteria has already been well described, it only recently emerged that human viruses also interact with bacteria in the mammalian gut. We studied whether this interaction could occur in tap water and thus confer enteric <b>viruses</b> <b>protection</b> against temperature and the classical disinfection treatments used in drinking water production. We demonstrated that the addition of lipopolysaccharide or peptidoglycan of bacterial origin to enterovirus provides thermal protection through stabilization of the viral capsid. This interaction plays a role when viruses are exposed to disinfection that targets the capsid, but less so when the virus genome is directly targeted. The interaction seems to be serotype-specific, suggesting that the capsid protein sequence could be important. The protection is linked to a direct association between viral particles and bacterial compounds as observed by microscopy. These results show that bacterial compounds present in the environment can affect virus inactivation...|$|R

500|$|Microsoft Security Essentials {{does not}} run on Windows 8 and later, {{which has its}} own {{security}} subsystem, Windows Defender. On 13 September 2011, at the Build conference in Anaheim, California, Microsoft unveiled the developer preview of Windows 8, which had a security component capable of preventing an infected USB flash memory from compromising the system during the boot process. On 15 September, Windows 8 developer's blog confirmed that Windows Defender in Windows 8 would take over the role of <b>virus</b> <b>protection.</b> In an included video, Jason Garms of Microsoft showed how Windows Defender is registered with Action Center as an AV and spyware protection tool, and how it blocks drive-by malware.

40|$|The nonstructural protein 1 (NS 1) of {{influenza}} A virus (IAV) enables {{the virus to}} disarm the host cell type 1 IFN defense system. Mutation or deletion of the NS 1 gene leads to attenuation of the virus and enhances host antiviral response making such live-attenuated influenza viruses attractive vaccine candidates. Sublingual (SL) immunization with live influenza virus {{has been found to}} be safe and effective for inducing protective immune responses in mucosal and systemic compartments. Here we demonstrate that SL immunization with NS 1 deleted IAV (DeltaNS 1 H 1 N 1 or DeltaNS 1 H 5 N 1) induced protection against challenge with homologous as well as heterosubtypic influenza <b>viruses.</b> <b>Protection</b> was comparable with that induced by intranasal (IN) immunization and was associated with high levels of virus-specific antibodies (Abs).

40|$|In {{order to}} protect the {{groundwater}} wells in shallow unconfined aquifers against contamination with <b>viruses</b> <b>protection</b> zones a travel time of 1 to 2 years (206 - 418 m) is needed by which a probability of infection of 10 - 4 per person per year will not be exceeded at the 95 %-certainty level. This implies that the current guideline of 60 days travel time for protection of groundwater wells in The Netherlands provides insufficient protection. This was concluded in this study where contamination of groundwater with viruses from a leaking sewer was simulated for a selection of shallow unconfined aquifers. The size of the protection zone is mainly determined by virus inactivation and attachment of viuses to soil. Sofar, it is unclear to what extent the presence of an unsaturated zone and the presence of attachment sites for viruses in the soil may contribute to the protection of groundwater wells. A smaller protection zone may be acceptable, if it can be shown or a reasonable case can be made that the well has properties leading to a reduced probability of virus contamination...|$|R

40|$|Antibodies play {{a central}} role in {{prophylaxis}} against many infectious agents. While neutralization is a primary function of antibodies, the Fc- and complement-dependent activities of these multifunctional proteins may also be critical in their ability to provide <b>protection</b> against most <b>viruses.</b> <b>Protection</b> against viral pathogens in vivo is complex, and while virus neutralization [...] the ability of antibody to inactivate virus infectivity, often measured in vitro [...] is important, it is often only a partial contributor in protection. The rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) remains the "gold standard" assay to measure rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies. In addition to neutralization, the rabies-specific antigen-binding activity of antibodies may be measured through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), as well as other available methods. For any disease, in selecting the appropriate assay(s) to use to assess antibody titers, assay validation and how they are interpreted are important considerations-but for a fatal disease like rabies, they are of paramount importance. The innate limitations of a one-dimensional laboratory test for rabies antibody measurement, as well as the validation of the method of choice, must be carefully considered in the selection of an assay method and for the interpretation of results that might be construed as a surrogate of protection...|$|R
