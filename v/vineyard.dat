40|$|Flavescence dorée (FD) is {{a severe}} Grape Yellows Disease of European <b>vineyards</b> whose phytoplasma causal agent is {{transmitted}} from grapevine to grapevine by the leafhopper Scaphoideus titanus Ball. Grapevines untreated with insecticides are considered potential sources of infectious vectors for treated <b>vineyards.</b> Research was carried out: (i) to study the spatial distribution of grapevines affected by FD, (ii) to compare the S. titanus population levels between treated and untreated <b>vineyards</b> and (iii) to verify if there are decreasing gradients of S. titanus adult captures in treated <b>vineyards</b> from contiguous untreated grapevines. In two <b>vineyards</b> with potential external sources of infected S. titanus populations in the near vicinity, a significant decreasing gradient of grapevines affected by FD was observed. In two other <b>vineyards</b> without untreated grapevines potential sources of infectious S. titanus in surrounding areas, an edge effect was not observed. The <b>vineyards</b> untreated with insecticides, both cultivated and abandoned, showed much higher population levels of S. titanus than treated <b>vineyards.</b> In <b>vineyards</b> treated against the vector, a decreasing gradient of S. titanus adult captures was observed from contiguous untreated grapevines. This occurrence shows that the vector moves from untreated grapevines to treated <b>vineyards.</b> So, if adult vectors moving from untreated grapevines are infected by FD phytoplasmas, they can represent a real risk for the surrounding <b>vineyards</b> treated with insecticides. Therefore, the strategy for effective FD control needs to also include: (i) insecticide treatments effective against S. titanus in all the grapegrowing areas with <b>vineyards</b> affected by FD and (ii) the eradication of abandoned <b>vineyards</b> and American grapevines growing wild in spontaneous vegetation...|$|R
