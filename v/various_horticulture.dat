40|$|Thesis (MTech (Horticulture)) [...] Peninsula Technikon, 2004 The term "horticultural therapy" is {{unfamiliar}} to most South Africans. However {{it is well}} accepted in South Africa that horticulture {{plays an important role}} in human well being both physically and psychological. It is generally believed that people who engage in gardening tend to benefit. The research study investigates whether plant related activities integrated into rehabilitation programme, actually benefit participants. It shows how patients at a chosen healthcare institution respond upon exposure to <b>various</b> <b>horticulture</b> activities in order to identify activities appropriate for the inclusion and design in a horticultural therapy programme. The study identifies factors necessary for the design of a business plan for a horticulturist engaging in a horticultural therapy programme under local conditions. The methodology adopted was mainly quantitative. The study is also descriptive in nature. It seeks to develop a model from a range of activities that would best meet the needs of specific groups subjects, through the careful and deliberate observation and evaluation of patients as they engage with the activities. The measuring instruments have been designed for experimentation research purpose. It involved setting up an experiment (patients engaged in a designed horticulture activity) and collecting the data. Information regarding the participant response to designed activities was also gathered on the basis of observations and interviews. The population consisted of patients admitted at a public (State) psychiatric institution in the Western Cape. The sample consisted of 12 patients, four patients from each of the following categories: Forensics, Intellectually Challenged, and Psychiatric. The designed activities consisted of 10 activities, and were centered around the following activities: Growing of herbs, learning to take cuttings, planting cuttings, planting seeds for outdoor garden, preparing a garden site, vegetable gardening, weeding, watering, and planting flowering annuals. The first objective of the study was to determine whether the response of different categories of patients to specific horticulture activities differ, in order to select the appropriate activity for each category. Forensic patients responded positively to all ten activities and recorded a high level (70 %) of task accomplishment. Intellectually challenged patients had a medium level (46 % to 69 %) of task accomplishment for the majority of the activities. Psychiatric patients had a high level (70 %) for 50 percent of the activities and a medium level (46 % to 69 %) of task accomplishment for the remainder of the activities. The second objective of the study was to evaluate the degree of effect of the different horticulture activities on each category of patients, in order to determine the relative importance of each activity in the programme in meeting the patients needs. The general findings are that the various categories responded differently to the subsections as shown in the results. Individual patients within the categories also differed in their response to various activities. The results of the study indicate that certain horticultural activities have an impact on patient's deficiencies and encourage their specific needs in the areas of a vocational/educational, interpersonal/social, and responsibility/development The study identified factors necessary for the design of a business plan for a horticulturist to engage in a horticultural therapy programme under local conditions. The business plan provides an outline to develop, market, and implement a horticultural therapy service. The business plan helps identify important ramifications of setting up a business and practicing as a contract worker. The research process has highlighted valuable aspects, which may be easily incorporated into a future horticulture therapy programme. It has shown that certain plant related activities, when successfully integrated into a rehabilitation programme, will benefit participants. The findings and recommendations provide guidelines for the formulation of a structured horticultural therapy programme. It encourages the concept of utilizing gardening in a structured/organized manner to benefit the well being of individuals. TABEISA, SANTA...|$|E

40|$|Sustainable {{landscape}} design focuses on long-lived plants that thrive in their growing conditions. Too often, gardeners are wow’d by the visual aesthetics {{of a plant}} and neglect {{to take into account}} its optimal growing requirements – and whether the site they are selecting for meets those requirements. The Plant Elements of Design plant selection program supports the {{landscape design}} process by providing a tool for selecting plants based on matching their characteristics to the site. This program is useful as a reference for <b>various</b> audiences including <b>horticulture</b> students and educators, landscape designers and architects, Master Gardeners, home gardeners, nurseries and garden centers, and landscape contractors, managers, and maintenance firms. This free, online database is populated with 2745 woody and herbaceous plants including over 5000 downloadable images. Plants can be chosen using 19 different plant characteristic and 350 site categories such as plant type, size, soil type, light requirements, texture, seasonal interest, design use and landscape use. All perennial plants in the database are considered hardy in USDA zone 4 with adjoining zones indicated. Users can print plant data sheets including images, and select and export selected plants to a. csv file for use as a plant key, project management, and landscape planning. The Plant Elements of Design was developed over 15 years and currently information provided for each plant is based on the knowledge and experience of University of Minnesota specialists, experienced gardening educators, and industry professionals...|$|R
50|$|Villa Bologna {{remains the}} {{residence}} of the de Traffords, the latest generation of the descendants of Fabrizio Grech, the man who built it. Like all other such estates, it has faced varying fortunes over the centuries. Shortly {{after the death of}} Lady Strickland, the woman who transformed the fortunes of the estate in the interwar period, the political and economic turmoil of the decolonisation period in Maltese history hit the villa and the family fortunes hard. More recently, the family is reviving the villa by turning it into a working estate. The gardens are now wholly accessible to the public and the villa may be booked for corporate and private events of all sorts. As with all such properties, the villa is a popular venue for filming. The family’s interest in gardening has not wavered since the days of Lady Strickland. <b>Various</b> ventures of <b>horticulture</b> are taking place, with methods of gardening and farming that are as natural as possible. The produce of the villa is on sale to the public from the grounds of the property. The house itself, and the collections, are not yet available to the public since much restoration has to be carried out before they are made thus available. However, the World War II shelter is freely accessible for anyone taking the garden tour. As always, the family is a dedicated sponsor of philanthropic events, and the villa hosts many such events throughout the year.|$|R
40|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 17 th century, floricultures as well as garden plants prospered in Edo as the {{pleasure}} of urban common people. Especially, one of the largest and most remarkable horticulture centers in the world was formed around Sugamo, Komagome and Somei villages in the northern periphery of Edo. Although the origin of the center’s formation was based on the gardening of daimyos and noble families, a prominent group of commercial farmers and gardeners became floriculture specialists for Edo’s ordinary residents. <b>Various</b> kinds of <b>horticulture</b> were developed such as garden plants, bonsai（ dwarf potted tree） and cultivation of morning glory and chrysanthemum. The origin of chrysanthemum species is assumed to be in China, however, the significant varieties have been developed in Japan, and a kind of chrysanthemum culture flourished throughout the Edo period. Additionally, a series of cultivation technology, including empirical scientific observations and chrysanthemum works and figure making were developed by the above mentioned entreprenant gardeners. Many practical guidebooks and manuals on floriculture, including Kadan-Chikinsho （花壇地錦抄），were published from the end of 17 th to 19 th century for many varieties of chrysanthemum. The objective of this paper is to analyze the diffusing process of chrysanthemum cultivation and people’s entertainment, and the spatial differentiation, from the viewpoint of urban expansion process of Edo （renamed Tokyo after 1867 ） as well as farmer’s commercial behavior, by reinterpreting historical documents and old local area maps. After Japan opened its country in 1858, some European “plant hunters” accompanied by official personnel started collecting plant seeds, nurseries of rare and beautiful flowers or trees such as azalea in Japan. Their aim was to bring them back to their sponsor’s countries safely to transplant. Their method of collecting growing plants was to buy them from gardeners or farmers around Edo/Tokyo or Yokohama, where a foreign settlement was located, rather than to explore wild species by themselves. The main reason of this was that all foreigners were strictly restricted to travel around in Japan. Robert Fortune （ 1812 - 1880 ）, a renowned English plant hunter who had mainly travelled inland China in search for useful plants like tea or rare and beautiful flowers which fit in cool climate of the UK, was a good example. The author also focuses on the network among plant hunters, gardeners and suburban farmers around Tokyo...|$|R
