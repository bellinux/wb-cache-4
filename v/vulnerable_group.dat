Because the street children in India have unique vulnerabilities – the amount of time they spend on the street, their livelihood depending on the street, and their lack of protection and care from adults – they are a subgroup of the Indian population that deserve specific attention {{in order to ensure that}} their needs are known. As the most <b>vulnerable</b> <b>group</b> of children in India according to UNICEF, they need to be understood as much as possible.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{response}} by Robert van Voren, Pekhterev {{in his article}} condescendingly argues that the Serbsky Institute was not so bad place and that Nekipelov exaggerates and slanders it, but Pekhterev, by doing so, misses the main point: living conditions in the Serbsky Institute were not bad, those who passed through psychiatric examination there were {{in a certain sense}} [...] "on holiday" [...] in comparison with the living conditions of the Gulag; and all the same, everyone was aware that the Serbsky Institute was more than the [...] "gates of hell" [...] from where people were sent to specialized psychiatric hospitals in Chernyakhovsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Kazan, Blagoveshchensk, and that is not all. Their life was transformed to unimaginable horror with daily tortures by forced administration of drugs, beatings and other forms of punishment. Many went crazy, could not endure what was happening to them, some even died during the [...] "treatment" [...] (for example, a miner from Donetsk Alexey Nikitin). Many books and memoirs are written about the life in the psychiatric Gulag and every time when reading them a shiver seizes us. The Soviet psychiatric terror in its brutality and targeting the mentally ill as the most <b>vulnerable</b> <b>group</b> of society had nothing on the Nazi euthanasia programs. The punishment by placement in a mental hospital was as effective as imprisonment in Mordovian concentration camps in breaking persons psychologically and physically. The recent history of the USSR should be given a wide publicity to immunize society against possible repetitions of the Soviet practice of political abuse of psychiatry. The issue remains highly relevant.|$|E

Identification of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups</b> {{in water}} {{resource}} conflicts {{is to improve}} the identification of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups</b> in the allocation of water rights and water markets water rights system. There are two difficulties: one is how to determine the weight of evaluation indexes; another is how to effectively deal with the subjectivity of the evaluation process and the low resolution. Therefore, this paper proposes “Information Entropy Based Fuzzy Pattern Recognition Model for Identification of <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>Groups</b> in Water Resource Conflicts (EFPQ- VRWC) ” according to the fuzzy pattern recognition based on the combination of the maximum entropy principle and genetic algorithms. And identifying <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups</b> of Daling River Basin in Liaoning Province, it illustrates the method of application value. And evaluation results have continuity, comparability and versatility so that can accurately reflect the level of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups</b> in water resource conflicts...|$|R
40|$|Ivanova et al {{explored}} how <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups</b> {{and principles}} of human rights are incorporated into national sexual and reproductive health (SRH) policies in 4 countries. They adapted the EquiFrame of Amin and colleagues of 2011, to SRH <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups</b> which we believe could now be used for analysis of national SRH polices beyond those 4 countries. Although we fully agree with the authors’ two main findings that <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups</b> and human rights’ principles are not sufficiently integrated in SRH policies nor granted the possibility {{to participate in the}} process of development in those four countries, we do believe that these shortcomings are not limited to those countries only nor to the identified <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups</b> either. We are convinced that the issue of SRH as such is still framed within a very limited logic for all with <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups</b> being perceived as an extra threat or an extra burden...|$|R
40|$|My {{graduation}} {{thesis is}} engaged in <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups</b> and human rights in Afghanistan. I defined women, children, handicapped and migrants as <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups.</b> First of all I tried to describe contemporary situation and status of these <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups</b> in Afghanistan. I tried to refer to all aspects of their vulnerability. In the next part I analyzed the roots of their vulnerability in detail. I concerned on environmental conditions, historic evolution, cultural background, economic development and development and stability of the state. In conclusion I tried to put forward a concept of solution, which should improve the situation of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups</b> and human rights in Afghanistan. The main actor of my analysis is a state, which {{from my point of}} view is the most important element of the development in Afghanistan. The important part of these questions is a collision of Western and Muslim culture or Afghan culture. This fact means a new very complicated dimension of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups</b> and human rights in Afghanistan...|$|R

[...] According to The Daily Telegraphs analysis, the speech contained a warning to David Cameron [...] "that a 'slack' attitude to immigration {{will result in the}} Coalition repeating the mistakes made under Labour, when the vast majority of new jobs generated before the recession were taken by immigrants". Duncan Smith believes that some companies are using immigration as [...] "an excuse to import labour to take up posts which could be filled by people already in Britain". He says Britain needs an immigration system that gives the unemployed [...] "a level playing field". [...] "If we do not get this right then we risk leaving more British citizens out of work, and the most <b>vulnerable</b> <b>group</b> who will be the most affected are young people," [...] he said.|$|E

As a result, water resource conflicts have become prominent problems in water resources management of China. The water resource conflicts are caused by such factors as inadequate water quantity, poor water quality and improper timing of water usage. This study firstly points out that neglecting to protect {{the interests of the}} <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups</b> often aggravates water resource conflicts. Then, the characteristics of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups</b> in water resource conflicts and their harm to the society are illustrated and the current research on <b>vulnerable</b> <b>groups</b> in various fields is briefly reviewed.
