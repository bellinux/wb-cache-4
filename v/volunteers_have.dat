40|$|Researchers have {{examined}} whether societal developments such as educational expansion, secularization, and {{changes on the}} job market affect levels of volunteering. We extend this research by studying the distribution of volunteering or possible {{changes in the way}} volunteering is determined.

Furthermore, the relationship between church attendance and <b>volunteering</b> <b>has</b> become stronger; although <b>volunteering</b> <b>has</b> gone down in general, churchgoers increase their volunteering for religious organizations on average. The role of education has also changed: the differences between the lower and higher educated in their participation in <b>volunteer</b> work <b>have</b> virtually disappeared. The determinants of the time invested in <b>volunteering</b> <b>have</b> changed less and turn out to be entirely different from the determinants of participation.
