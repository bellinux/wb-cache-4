6000|$|In {{order to}} have a {{complete}} description of the motion, we must specify how the body alters its position with time i.e. for every point on the trajectory it must be stated at what time the body is situated there.

If we take our stand on the ground of classical mechanics, we can satisfy this requirement for our illustration in the following manner. We imagine two clocks of identical construction the man at the railway-carriage window is holding one of them, and the man on the footpath the other. Each of the observers determines the position on his own reference-body occupied by the stone at each tick of the clock he is holding in his hand.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the relation between the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> flow <b>propagation</b> and left ventricular relaxation by using color M-mode Doppler echocardiography to analyze flow propagation in the left ventricle. Background. Noninvasive attempts to identify alterations in left ventricular relaxation have been hampered because both the relaxation rate and left atrial filling pressure are the determinants <b>of</b> peak early <b>velocity</b> and filling rate. Methods. Color M-mode velocity data were transferred to a microcomputer and compared with conventional pulsed Doppler data to assess the ability of color M-mode echocardiography to analyze velocity field properties. The <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> flow <b>propagation</b> was measured as the slope of the flow wave front during early filling in normal subjects (n = 29) and in patients with disease that alters relaxation (dilated cardiomyopathy [n = 31], ischemic cardiomyopathy [n = 8], hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [n = 5], systemic hypertension [n = 22] and aortic valve disease [n = 25]). In nine patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy, echocardiographic and left heart catheterization data were obtained at baseline and during intracoronary dobutamine infusion. Results. Color M-mode and pulsed Doppler echocardiographic data were highly correlated (n = 217, r = 0. 94, p < 0. 0001, velocity range 0. 2 to 1. 5 m/s). The <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> flow <b>propagation</b> was lower in patients than in normal subjects (0. 46 ± 0. 15 vs. 0. 84 ± 0. 11 m/s, p < 0. 0001). The decrease was significant in all disease forms with or without left ventricular dilation. The <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> flow <b>propagation</b> was related to peak early velocity in normal subjects (p < 0. 001) but not in patients. It varied inversely with the isovolumetric relaxation time constant during dobutamine infusion and the two variables were highly correlated (p < 0. 0001). Conclusions. The <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> flow <b>propagation</b> during early filling seems to be highly dependent on the left ventricular relaxation rate and could be an important tool in studying diastolic function...|$|R

Compared to the W groups, M rats presented higher (p< 0. 05) CSD amplitudes and <b>velocities</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation.</b> In both nutritional conditions, AA-treatment significantly increased CSD amplitudes and propagation velocities (p< 0. 05), as compared to non-treated (‘naïve’; Nv) and saline-treated (Sal) controls.
