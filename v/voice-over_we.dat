500|$|Before {{production}} began, {{the production}} team sought out Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, or Korean vocal talents. Tia Carrere {{was an early}} candidate to voice the title character, and Lea Salonga, {{who had been the}} singing voice of Princess Jasmine in Aladdin, was also cast as Mulan's speaking voice, but the directors did not find her attempt at a deeper speaking voice when Mulan impersonated Ping convincing, so Ming-Na Wen was brought in to speak the role. Salonga returned to provide the singing voice. Wen herself landed the role after the filmmakers listened to her narration at the beginning of The Joy Luck Club. Coats reflected on her decision, stating [...] "When we heard Ming-Na doing that <b>voice-over,</b> <b>we</b> knew we had our Mulan. She has a very likable and lovely voice, and those are the qualities we were looking for." [...] For the role of Mushu, Disney was aiming for top Hollywood talent in the vein of Robin Williams's performance as the Genie, and approached Eddie Murphy, who at first balked during recording in the Disney studios, and asked to record the voice in his basement at his Bubble Hill mansion in Englewood, New Jersey. For the speaking voice of Captain Li Shang, B. D. Wong was hired, although his singing voice, for the song [...] "I'll Make a Man Out of You", was performed by Donny Osmond, who had originally auditioned as the speaking voice of the title character in Hercules. Osmond's casting originated from a suggestion from the casting director, and throughout recording, Osmond studied Wong's dialogue tapes, and aimed to match his inflections and personality. Osmond commented that his sons decided that he had finally [...] "made it" [...] in show business when he was in a Disney film. Likewise for the role of Grandmother Fa, June Foray provided for the speaking voice, and Marni Nixon supplied the singing voice.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>voice-over</b> <b>we</b> {{learn that}} Lieutenant Commander Ivanova is {{temporarily}} {{in command of}} Babylon 5 and that Jeffrey Sinclair, the Commander of Babylon 5, had been recalled to Earth 8 days earlier. The events from the last episode of season one are recounted.|$|E
5000|$|Stage Fright {{garnered}} some {{adverse publicity}} upon its initial release {{due to the}} [...] "lying flashback" [...] seen {{near the beginning of}} the film. However, some film critics, including those of Cahiers du cinéma, see the flashback as simply being an illustration of one person's version of the events: the events as recounted by the character whose <b>voice-over</b> <b>we</b> hear, which was presumably Hitchcock's intention.|$|E
40|$|Letter to Jane (1972), a 52 -minute {{essay in}} the form of a film {{centered}} on a single photograph, has been criticized to be a statement of the male dominance over the female figure. This paper evaluates this critique by analyzing the interactions of gender with image and sound throughout the film based on three prominent theories. Through Laura Mulvey’s theory of “the gaze ” we find that Letter to Jane presents an active female character and passive male figures, contrary to the traditional gender roles that Mulvey argues are present in Hollywood cinema. Based on Mary Ann Doane’s theory of the <b>voice-over</b> commentary <b>we</b> understand that the presence of the two male narrators in the film takes away the authority and dominance of the masculine voice. It can be realized that Letter to Jane uses Bertolt Brecht’s “alienation effect”, which creates a distance between the events and the spectators of the film. From these three theories, it can be concluded that Letter to Jane asks the audience to consciously make an evaluation of the gender roles rather than accept the traditional dominant male figure and passive female figure...|$|R
5000|$|John Godson, who was {{directing}} {{the news that}} night remembered, When Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon's surface, the whole BBC control room, with the canteen ladies and security guards standing beside the vision control desk, exploded into cheering and clapping. To us {{it had been a}} similar type of relief as it must have been to Armstrong, his crew and Ground Control. Up to now, nothing had gone wrong. I vividly recall we had Armstrong's 'One small step' spiel with very little distortion, considering he was in full lunar gear. I mean, it was easily comprehensible though, shall we say, slightly garbled. It was quite difficult to make any visual sense out of the first pictures from the lunar surface, as I recollect. But under those circumstances we would have had James Burke describe, <b>voice-over,</b> what <b>we</b> were trying to assimilate with our eyes. I was there to direct the situation - to decide when voice-over explanations were required, to be ready to take actions if the picture circuits failed. In fact, it resulted in quite a calm overnight operation with, if I remember correctly, not a single major panic situation other than numerous sound comprehension problems.|$|R
5000|$|And one of {{the most}} {{powerful}} visual sleights of hand in Closet Land itself is when, to torturer Alan Rickmans <b>voice-over,</b> <b>we</b> see shots of [...] "innocent" [...] children reconfigured with the uncropped image to show a child greeting Hitler, one at a Ku Klux Klan rally and a young gun-toting terrorist. By sheer serendipity, my initial encounter with Bharadwajs work illustrates one of her major thematic interests: things arent always what they seem to be.|$|E
50|$|As Legs boards a {{truck that}} stopped, Maddie watches it {{disappear}} {{down the road}} and walks over to climb the bridge (in the same way that Legs did, thus conquering her fear of heights. In a <b>voice-over,</b> <b>we</b> hear that Maddie got back together with Ethan, graduated high school, gotten accepted into art school, and traveled half way around the world, stopping at airports and bus stops along the way. She has not seen Legs again, but she meets the others once in a while and they get together to reminisce about the past.|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} scene, through a <b>voice-over,</b> <b>we</b> learn {{the fate of}} all the friends from Westwood High. Pirate never got to travel the country. Having been drafted, he is killed in Vietnam. Stick, on the other hand, goes to Vietnam and serves with distinction, earning a Bronze Star. Calvin {{graduated}} from Princeton {{and went on to}} become a U.S. Senator. Tracy has led a very unfulfilling life, full of failed marriages and problems with addiction. Finnegan goes on to be one of the most popular professors at U.C.L.A. Although Mary Beth had promised to never forget them, and that they would always be friends, she never saw any of them again, save for Sunshine. Mary Beth did attend Berkeley and is godmother to Sunshine's son, Pirate.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{research}} has shown that pairs of stimuli which are congruent and assumed to 'go together' are recalled more effectively than an item presented in isolation. Will this multisensory memory benefit occur when stimuli are richer and longer, in an ecological setting? In the present study, we focused on an everyday situation of audio-visual learning and manipulated the relationship between audio guide tracks and viewed portraits in the galleries of the Tate Britain. By varying the gender and narrative style of the <b>voice-over,</b> <b>we</b> examined how the perceived congruency and assumed unity of the audio guide track with painted portraits affected subsequent recall. We show that tracks perceived as best matching the viewed portraits led to greater recall of both sensory and linguistic content. We provide the first evidence that manipulating crossmodal congruence and unity assumptions can effectively impact memory in a multisensory ecological setting, {{even in the absence of}} precise temporal alignment between sensory cues...|$|E
40|$|The new defined {{degrees in}} our {{university}} follow {{the recommendations of}} the European Higher Education Area (Bologna Declaration). Among these recommendations, our teaching work should be focused on student work and learning student process. That is why our proposal is devoted to achieve a more active classes supported by the continuous work of the students. We propose our students to solve certain exercises and once they have thought them, we show the resolution in video format (along with a PDF file). The whole activity is performed in our complementary virtual course that uses Moodle platform. We believe that the resolution in this format is well received by this generation of students who are immersed since childhood in new IT technologies. The use of this material can be understood in several ways, we have chosen the one in which the resolution is made in a LATEX format and the use of CAMTASIA allows animating the resolution by means of a <b>voice-over.</b> <b>We</b> also propose the holding of examinations via Internet that take place outside faculty timetable, at home. These are quizzes that evaluate the progress of knowledge on a continuous learning (about a review every 3 weeks). These tests are performed through Moddle, helping us in various aspects of teaching. The most straightforward purpose is as an evaluation tool, but they can also be used as a learning tool. In the last case the questions need to be completed with more information to guide the student to reach the correct answer. At any case, we consider these tools a good way to motivate the student and {{to improve the quality of}} the learning of our students. Preprin...|$|E
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to evaluate “what has been lost” in the simultaneous interpretation and transcription processes of selected Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) testimonies. The testimonies under consideration are those of two of the widows of the Cradock Four who were murdered by the South African Security Branch in 1985 for their work in mobilising resistance to apartheid. The widows testified in Xhosa at the East London Human Rights Violation hearings in 1996 and their testimonies were simultaneously interpreted into English {{on the day of the}} hearing. Using audiovisual copies of the testimonies on which one can hear the original soundtrack, as well as the English <b>voice-over,</b> <b>we</b> transcribed the testimonies in the source language (e. g. Xhosa). We then translated these into English and compared our translation with the official English versions which are published on the TRC website. Our analysis revealed that a significant number of meanings were lost under the pressures of simultaneous interpretation. These meanings related predominantly to the ‘emotional’ content: for example, to aspects of narrative style expressed through gesture, intonation, repetition and the use of direct speech, particularly the verbatim quotes of the police in Afrikaans. We also noted that an understanding of the culture of the testifier was essential to understanding the testimony and that researchers who did not have access to the testimony in the source language and the cultural codes of the testifier would be significantly compromised when trying to understand the testimonies. In addition, we noted the loss of a number of factual meanings as a result of inaccuracies and omissions both during the interpretation and transcription process. We argued that these losses and omissions detracted primarily from what the TRC referred to as the ‘narrative truth’ or subjective meanings of the testimonies, and, in some cases, the ‘factual truth’. We undertook {{this research}} because we are concerned that many researchers only have access to the official TRC record. This record, in our view, is in some cases compromised as the processes of simultaneous interpretation and transcription inevitably led to some loss of meaning due to the pressures and constraints under which the interpreters were working...|$|E
