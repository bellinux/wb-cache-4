5|$|HIV is {{different}} in structure from other retroviruses. It is roughly spherical with a diameter of about 120nm, around 60times smaller than a red blood cell. It is composed of two copies of positive single-stranded RNA that codes for the virus's nine genes enclosed by a conical capsid composed of 2,000 copies of the viral protein p24. The single-stranded RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7, and enzymes needed {{for the development of}} the <b>virion</b> such as reverse transcriptase, proteases, ribonuclease and integrase. A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring the integrity of the <b>virion</b> particle.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of the polyene antibiotic filipin with membrane-bound cholesterol in vesicular stomatitis (VS), influenza, and Rauscher leukemia <b>virions</b> was studied. Exposure of <b>virions</b> to filipin resulted {{in a series of}} depressions and ridges in the envelope of VS <b>virions,</b> with a periodicity of 15 to 20 nm perpendicular to the long axis of the particle; similar morphological alterations were observed in negatively stained preparations, in thin-sectioned <b>virions,</b> and in protease-treated <b>virions</b> that lack surface glycoproteins. This morphological effect was specific for filipin, since the envelopes of VS <b>virions</b> that had been treated with another polyene antibiotic, amphotericin B, exhibited markedly different morphology. Morphological alterations induced by filipin in influenza and Rauscher leukemia <b>virions</b> differed from those seen in VS <b>virions.</b> The infectivity of filipin-treated VS <b>virions</b> was reduced up to 500 -fold, whereas influenza <b>virions</b> were resistant to filipin treatment. Incorporation of filipin into the <b>virions</b> was demonstrated, and no release of either lipids or proteins from <b>virions</b> was detected after filipin treatment. A stoichiometry of approximately 1 mol of bound filipin per mol of cholesterol was found in both intact and protease-treated VS <b>virions.</b> The equilibrium dissociation constant for filipin-cholesterol interaction was approximately 74 -fold larger in intact than in protease-treated VS <b>virions.</b> The initial rate of association of filipin with cholesterol in intact <b>virions</b> was slower than that in protease-treated particles. The fluidity of lipids in VS viral membranes, as probed by a stearic acid derivative spin label, was markedly reduced when either intact or protease-treated <b>virions</b> were treated with filipin...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The in vivo {{distribution}} of turkey herpesvirus (HVT) and morphological changes {{induced by the}} virus in the visceral organs, blood cells, gonads, and brains of turkeys naturally infected with HVT were examined at the ultrastructural level. Widespread {{distribution of}} the <b>virions</b> was found in neural, visceral, and lymphatic tissues. Notable cytoplasmic changes were marked destruction of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosomes. Nuclear changes included presence of inclusion bodies, clumping and margination of the chromatin, and hypertrophy of the nucleoli. Naked and enveloped <b>virions</b> were seen both in the cytoplasm and nuclei. Cytoplas-mic <b>virions</b> were more numerous than nuclear <b>virions.</b> Enveloped <b>virions</b> were of two forms, suggesting different routes of viral envelopment. There was evidence of blood-borne <b>virions</b> in leukocytes in transit through different tissues, and <b>virions</b> were seen in synaptic vesicles within organs suggesting another possible route of infection. Herpes <b>virions</b> in the spleen and intestine were often found in lysosome-like bodies. In leuko-cytes, vacuoles containing many enveloped <b>virions</b> and myelin figures characteristic of cellular degeneration were often seen. Some cells containing <b>virions</b> had pinocytotic vesicles believed to aid in entry of <b>virions</b> into cells. It was evident that the turkey herpesvirus was capable of infecting numerous tissues often resulting in mild degenerative changes within the cells...|$|R

5|$|At {{least six}} of the twelve {{proteins}} encoded by the rotavirus genome bind RNA. The role of these proteins play in rotavirus replication is not entirely understood; their functions {{are thought to be}} related to RNA synthesis and packaging in the <b>virion,</b> mRNA transport to the site of genome replication, and mRNA translation and regulation of gene expression.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus uses two key {{mechanisms}} {{to evade the}} immune system. First, {{it is capable of}} surviving the highly acidic conditions of the stomach, allowing the virus to infect the host and spread throughout the body via the lymphatic system. Second, because it can replicate very quickly, the virus overwhelms the host organs before an immune response can be mounted. If detail is given at the attachment phase; poliovirus with canyons on the <b>virion</b> surface have virus attachment sites located in pockets at the canyon bases. The canyons are too narrow for access by antibodies, so the virus attachment sites are protected from the host’s immune surveillance, while the remainder of the <b>virion</b> surface can mutate to avoid the host’s immune response.|$|E

40|$|Defective {{influenza}} <b>virions</b> undergo {{gradual changes}} during passage of undiluted material: {{the amount of}} RNA in <b>virions</b> diminishes, the equimolarity of the RNA segments is lost and the interfering activity of defective <b>virions</b> decreases. Defective <b>virions</b> of early passages have a small deficiency in genetic material and at a high m. o. i, induce the synthesis of the complete set of virus-specific proteins.

40|$|<b>Virions</b> {{produced}} by {{cells in the}} presence of actinomycin D (Act D <b>virions)</b> contain reverse transcriptase but are deficient in 70 S genomic RNA. To assess the role of genomic RNA in encapsidation of a functional reverse transcriptase and to study the interaction of the enzyme and its template in the cores of intact <b>virions,</b> the reverse transcriptase enzymes of normal and Act D <b>virions</b> were compared. The enzymes were indistinguishable by column chromatography, sedimentation velocity, or template/primer preferences. In addition, these enzymes showed equal sensitivity to inactivation by antibodies directed against Rauscher murine leukemia virus DNA polymerase. The enzymes from Act D and normal <b>virions</b> had similar thermal decay rates and were both protected against heat denaturation by natural and synthetic template/primers. By these criteria, the DNA polymerase molecules synthesized and assembled into <b>virions</b> in the absence of genomic RNA are identical to those packaged under normal conditions. Additional studies designed to measure protection of reverse transcriptase by genomic RNA were carried out by comparing the thermal lability of the enzyme in intact Act D and normal <b>virions.</b> The thermal decay rate of reverse transcriptase in Act D <b>virions</b> was identical to that in control <b>virions.</b> In contrast to the lability of the virion-associated enzyme, however, genomic RNA in control <b>virions</b> was stable to heat treatment...|$|R
5|$|The {{proteasome}} is {{also involved}} in Intracellular antibody-mediated proteolysis of antibody-bound virions. In this neutralisation pathway, TRIM21 (a protein of the tripartite motif family) binds with immunoglobulin G to direct the <b>virion</b> to the proteasome where it is degraded.|$|E
5|$|There are six viral {{proteins}} (VPs) {{that form}} the virus particle (<b>virion).</b> These structural proteins are called VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, VP6 and VP7.

5|$|VP3 {{is part of}} {{the inner}} core of the <b>virion</b> and is an enzyme called guanylyl transferase.

50|$|The <b>virions</b> {{of certain}} viruses {{sometimes}} exhibit pleomorphism, {{in the sense}} that their appearances can vary.

40|$|Herpes simplex virus (HSV) nucleocapsids acquire an {{envelope}} by budding through the inner nuclear membrane, {{but it is}} uncertain whether this envelope is retained during virus maturation and egress or whether mature progeny <b>virions</b> are derived by deenvelopment at the outer nuclear membrane followed by reenvelopment in a cytoplasmic compartment. To resolve this issue, we used immunogold electron microscopy to examine the distribution of glycoprotein D (gD) in cells infected with HSV- 1 encoding a wild-type gD or a gD which is retrieved to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In cells infected with wild-type HSV- 1, extracellular <b>virions</b> and <b>virions</b> in the perinuclear space bound approximately equal amounts of gD antibody. In cells infected with HSV- 1 encoding an ER-retrieved gD, {{the inner and outer}} nuclear membranes were heavily gold labeled, as were perinuclear enveloped <b>virions.</b> Extracellular <b>virions</b> exhibited very little gold decoration (10 - to 30 -fold less than perinuclear <b>virions).</b> We conclude that the envelope of perinuclear <b>virions</b> must be lost during maturation and egress and that mature progeny <b>virions</b> must acquire {{an envelope}} from a post-ER cytoplasmic compartment. We noted also that gD appears to be excluded from the plasma membrane in cells infected with wild-type virus...|$|R
5|$|A virus particle, {{also known}} as a <b>virion,</b> {{consists}} of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a capsid. The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers can either be icosahedral (20-sided), helical or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of lipid (fat) called an envelope.|$|E
5|$|The term {{viral tropism}} {{refers to the}} cell types a virus infects. HIV can infect a variety of immune cells such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and microglial cells.

5|$|VP4 is on {{the surface}} of the <b>virion</b> that {{protrudes}} as a spike. It binds to molecules {{on the surface of}} cells called receptors and drives the entry of the virus into the cell.

VP4 determines how virulent the virus is and it determines the P-type of the virus.|$|E
40|$|Preparations of Amsacta moorei entomopox <b>virions</b> were {{obtained}} from virus-containing inclusions (VCI) by using a carbonate-thioglycolate solution (pH 10. 7 – 11. 5). The <b>virions</b> possessed a uniform coat (“halo”) surrounding the viral envelope and exhibited an RNA polymerase activity. The “halo” could be removed by prolonged exposure to the carbonate-thioglycolate solution. <b>Virions</b> obtained by this treatment, however, possessed low infectivity and no detectable RNA polymerase activity. Removal of the “halo” by trypsin resulted in <b>virions</b> which possessed RNA polymerase activity and relatively high infectivity. Preparations of particles with and without the “halo” were similar in percent DNA, protein per OD 260, number of particles per OD 260, and RNA polymerase activity. Particles without the “halo,” however, were less dense (1. 262 g/cm 3) in CsCl than those with the “halo” (1. 282 g/cm 3) and 15 – 45 times more infective. Parallel studies of “nonhaloed” Amsacta <b>virions</b> (trypsin-treated) and vaccinia <b>virions</b> showed that both viruses contained similar amounts of protein per OD 260, but Amsacta <b>virions</b> contained only 36 % of the DNA found in vaccinia...|$|R
40|$|The {{wild-type}} (WT) isolate of soil-borne wheat mosaic {{virus has}} {{two species of}} rodshaped <b>virions</b> 281 nm and 138 nm in length, which are designated as <b>virions</b> 1 ∙ 0 L and 0 ∙ 5 L, respectively. We reported previously that <b>virions</b> shorter than 0 ∙ 5 L arose in assay plants inoculated with separated and recombined 1 ∙ 0 L RNA and 0 ∙ 5 L RNA and suggested that these short <b>virions</b> were caused by deletion mutation of 0 ∙ 5 L RNA. We now report that these short <b>virions</b> arose {{after a period of}} several months in wheat plants that had been inoculated manually with unpurified WT isolate, and also when plants infected naturally in fields infested by the fungal vector, Polymyxa graminis, were grown at 17 °C. The sizes and relative proportions of <b>virions</b> shorter than 0 ∙ 5 L varied both from plant to plant and in the same plant sampled at different times.

40|$|In the {{prevailing}} model of HIV- 1 trans-infection, dendritic cells (DCs) capture and internalize intact <b>virions</b> and transfer these <b>virions</b> to interacting T cells at the virological synapse. Here, {{we show that}} HIV- 1 <b>virions</b> transmitted in trans from in vitro derived DCs to T cells principally originate {{from the surface of}} DCs. Selective neutralization of surface-bound <b>virions</b> abrogated trans-infection by monocyte-derived DCs and CD 34 -derived Langerhans cells. Under conditions mimicking antigen recognition by the interacting T cells, most transferred <b>virions</b> still derived from the cell surface, although a few were transferred from an internal compartment.

5|$|RNA {{interference}} is {{an important}} innate defence against viruses. Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). When such a virus infects a cell, it releases its RNA molecule or molecules, which immediately bind to a protein complex called a dicer that cuts the RNA into smaller pieces. A biochemical pathway – the RISC complex, is activated, which ensures cell survival by degrading the viral mRNA. Rotaviruses have evolved to avoid this defence mechanism by not uncoating fully inside the cell, and releasing newly produced mRNA through pores in the particle's inner capsid. Their genomic dsRNA remains protected inside {{the core of the}} <b>virion.</b>|$|E
5|$|This complex {{scenario}} {{leads to}} the generation of many variants of HIV in a single infected patient {{in the course of}} one day. This variability is compounded when a single cell is simultaneously infected by two or more different strains of HIV. When simultaneous infection occurs, the genome of progeny virions may be composed of RNA strands from two different strains. This hybrid <b>virion</b> then infects a new cell where it undergoes replication. As this happens, the reverse transcriptase, by jumping {{back and forth between the}} two different RNA templates, will generate a newly synthesized retroviral DNA sequence that is a recombinant between the two parental genomes. This recombination is most obvious when it occurs between subtypes.|$|E
5|$|Viral genomes are circular, {{as in the}} polyomaviruses, or linear, as in the adenoviruses. The type of {{nucleic acid}} is {{irrelevant}} {{to the shape of}} the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid. However, all segments are not required {{to be in the same}} <b>virion</b> for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by brome mosaic virus and several other plant viruses.|$|E
40|$|The {{neutralization}} of type 1 poliovirus by {{monoclonal antibody}} 35 - 1 f 4 was studied.

40|$|La Crosse (LAC) <b>virions</b> were cryopreserved by rapid {{freezing}} in a {{thin layer}} of vitreous ice. The vitrified-hydrated LAC <b>virions</b> were subsequently imaged at - 170 degrees C in a transmission electron microscope equipped with a low-temperature specimen holder.

Images of vitrified-hydrated LAC <b>virions</b> clearly revealed surface spikes as well as bilayer structure. Size measurements of the vitrified-hydrated LAC <b>virions</b> showed heterogeneity, with diameters ranging from 75 to 115 nm. Regardless of the particle size, the spike was about 10 nm long, and the bilayer was about 4 nm thick.

5|$|The poxviruses are large, complex {{viruses that}} have an unusual morphology. The viral genome is {{associated}} with proteins within a central disc structure known as a nucleoid.

The whole <b>virion</b> is slightly pleiomorphic, ranging from ovoid to brick shape. Mimivirus {{is one of the largest}} characterised viruses, with a capsid diameter of 400nm. Protein filaments measuring 100nm project from the surface. The capsid appears hexagonal under an electron microscope, therefore the capsid is probably icosahedral. In 2011, researchers discovered the largest then known virus in samples of water collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Las Cruces, Chile. Provisionally named Megavirus chilensis, it can be seen with a basic optical microscope. In 2013, the Pandoravirus genus was discovered in Chile and Australia, and has genomes about twice as large as Megavirus and Mimivirus.|$|E
5|$|While not {{inside an}} {{infected}} cell {{or in the}} process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles. These viral particles, also known as virions, consist of two or three parts: (i) the genetic material made from either DNA or RNA, long molecules that carry genetic information; (ii) a protein coat, called the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an envelope of lipids that surrounds the protein coat when they are outside a cell. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms for some virus species to more complex structures for others.

25|$|The {{glycoprotein}} {{shell of}} the mature DENV <b>virion</b> consists of 180 copies each of the E protein and M protein. The immature <b>virion</b> starts out with the E and prM proteins forming 90 heterodimers that give a spiky exterior to the viral particle. This immature viral particle buds into the endoplasmic reticulum and eventually travels via the secretory pathway to the Golgi apparatus. As the <b>virion</b> passes through the trans-Golgi Network (TGN) it is exposed to low pH. This acidic environment causes a conformational change in the E protein which disassociates it from the prM protein and causes it to form E homodimers. These homodimers lie flat against the viral surface giving the maturing <b>virion</b> a smooth appearance. During this maturation pr peptide is cleaved from the M peptide by the host protease, furin. The M protein then acts as a transmembrane protein under the E-protein {{shell of the}} mature <b>virion.</b> The pr peptide stays associated with the E protein until the viral particle is released into the extracellular environment. This pr peptide acts like a cap, covering the hydrophobic fusion loop of the E protein until the viral particle has exited the cell.|$|E
40|$|Two {{modes of}} {{assembly}} of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) {{were observed in}} cultured mouse embryo fïbroblasts, generating two morphologically different types of viral particles: monocapsid <b>virions</b> and multicapsid <b>virions.</b> The assembly of nucleocapsids {{appeared to be the}} same for both types of morphogenesis. Three successive stages of intranuclear capsid formation could be distinguished: capsids with electron-lucent cores, coreless capsids, and capsids with dense cores. Some of the capsids were enveloped at the inner nuclear membrane to form monocapsid <b>virions,</b> which were first detectable in the perinuclear cisterna. Other capsids left the nucleus via nuclear pores and usually entered cytoplasmic capsid aggregates that received an envelope by budding into extended cytoplasmic vacuoles, thereby forming multicapsid <b>virions.</b> Since the formation of multicapsid <b>virions</b> is not restricted to cell culture conditions and also occurs in vivo in immunosuppressed mice, multicapsid <b>virions</b> {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of cytomegalovirus infection. ...|$|R

The virus produced by SQ-A cells induces erythroleukemia associated with anemia in adult mice but has little activity when assayed on XC cells. It was characterized to determine what factors influence its leukemogenic potential. As compared to the attenuated virus from cultures of 5 - 86 and G- 2 cells, the subunits of the RNA from the <b>virions</b> of SQ-A cells are the same size, and the amount of reverse transcriptase activity and RNase H present in the purified <b>virions</b> of the three lines are similar.

Antiserum against purified <b>virions</b> and antiserum against the C-terminus of the putative coat protein-encoding region of ORF III detected the same virus-specific proteins, {{indicating that the}} CoYMV coat protein is encoded in ORF III. In addition to the two major forms of the coat protein (37 and 39 kDa), several high molecular weight virus-specific proteins were detected when <b>virions</b> were isolated without chloroform treatment. These proteins are possible ORF III polyprotein processing intermediates and might be associated with “immature” <b>virions</b> which are eliminated by chloroform treatment. As predicted by the genomic sequence, a 20 -kDa virus-specific protein was detected by an antiserum raised against the C-terminus of the putative ORF I protein. Results of filtration experiments suggest that the ORF I protein is equally associated with <b>virions</b> and with plant component(s). The association between the ORF I protein and the <b>virions</b> was further confirmed using immunosorbent electron microscopy and immunogold labeling. The ORF I protein was not detected in virus preparations treated with chloroform, and colocalized with <b>virions</b> containing immature coat protein on sucrose–cesium sulfate density gradients, suggesting that it is associated with immature <b>virions.</b> An antiserum raised against the putative ORF II gene product detected a 15 -kDa virus-specific protein whose association with the <b>virions</b> was unaffected by chloroform treatment.
