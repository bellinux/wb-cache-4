Regarding to plant varietal protection, an information used to describe agronomic characteristics of a given plant variety should follow Mendelian rules and not be affected by environments. DNA fingerprints of 33 Thai recommended rice varieties were conducted by using 32 DNA markers.

Inter cluster distance was least between cluster II and cluster III and cluster I and VI, indicating less divergence in these four clusters. Maximum inter cluster distance was noticed between the cluster V and cluster VI, cluster IV and cluster VI, cluster II and cluster VI and cluster I and cluster V, indicating more divergence of cluster V and this cluster had five genotypes viz.,C - 2291, ICP 7234, ICP 12225, AL 1741, ICP 2391. Accessions of cluster V were more divergent with maximum intra cluster distance followed by cluster I. The crossing between cluster V which is having high cluster mean value for seed yield per plant and number of pods per plant and cluster II which is having lowest mean for days to 50 percent flowering is expected to yield high yielding early pigeopea varieties.

40|$|Several {{alternative}} options {{have been}} used for <b>varietal</b> <b>identification.</b> However most of the traditional methods have inherent uncertainty levels and estimates often have wide confidence intervals. In an attempt to circumvent traditional survey-based measurement errors in <b>varietal</b> <b>identification,</b> DNA-based <b>varietal</b> <b>identification</b> has been implemented in the Cassava Monitoring Survey (CMS) of Nigeria — a large adoption study involving 2500 cassava farming households. The DNA fingerprinting technique offers a reliable method to accurately identify varieties grown by farmers and increases accuracy and credibility in the interpretation of adoption rates and associated economic and policy analyses. Unlike phenotype-based methods, DNA is not affected by environmental conditions or plant growth stage and is more abundant than morphological descriptors. However, undertaking a credible DNA-based <b>varietal</b> <b>identification</b> is not a trivial matter because of the logistical challenges involving sample collection and tracking by a large team of field enumerators.

Initially, 92 SSR markers were genotyped in 20 Brazilian cotton cultivars. Of this total, 38 loci were polymorphic, two of which were amplified by one primer pair; {{the mean number of}} alleles per locus was 2. 2. The values of polymorphic information content (PIC) and discrimination power (DP) were, on average, 0. 374 and 0. 433, respectively. The mean genetic distance was 0. 397 (minimum of 0. 092 and maximum of 0. 641). A panel of 96 varieties originating from different regions of the world was assessed by 21 polymorphic loci derived from 17 selected primer pairs. Among these varieties, the mean genetic distance was 0. 387 (minimum of 0 and maximum of 0. 786).

Study results also alluded to the heterogeneity of farmer varieties, whose naming appears to be a function of a few traits. The study suggests that optimisation of on-farm conservation strategy for this germplasm should primarily focus on high diversity areas and perhaps recognise those traits envisaged to be of importance by farmers for <b>varietal</b> <b>identification...</b>|$|E
40|$|Assessment {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} and molecular characterization among elite rice varieties of Bangladesh {{is very important}} for germplasm management, <b>varietal</b> <b>identification</b> and DNA fingerprinting. Thirty-four microsatellite markers were studied across 21 types of rice to characterize and discriminate among different varieties. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 11, with an average of 4. 18 alleles across 34 loci. A total of 57 rare alleles were detected at 24 loci, where-as 42 unique alleles were detected at 20 loci. The results revealed that 14 rice varieties produced unique alleles, which could be used for identification, molecular characterization and DNA fingerprinting of these varieties. Polymorphic information content (PIC) values ranged from 0. 157 to 0. 838, with an average of 0. 488, which revealed that much variation was present among the studied varieties. The PIC values revealed that RM 401 might be the best marker for identification and diversity estimation of rice varieties, followed by RM 566, RM 3428, RM 463, and RM 8094 markers. The UPGM...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to verify the applicability of microsatellite (SSR) markers in High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis for the identification of the olive cultivars used in the "Terra di Bari" PDO extra virgin olive oil. A panel of nine cultivars, widespread in Apulia region, was tested with seventeen SSR primer pairs and the PCR products were at first analysed with a Genetic Analyzer automatic sequencer. An identification key was obtained for the nine cultivars, which showed an unambiguous discrimination among the varieties constituting the "Terra di Bari" PDO extra virgin olive oil: Cima di Bitonto, Coratina, and Ogliarola. Subsequently, an SSR based method was set up with the DCA 18 marker, coupled with HRM analysis for the distinction of the Terra di Bari olive oil from non-Terra di Bari olive oil using different mixtures. Thus, this analysis enabled the distinction and identification of the PDO mixtures. Hence, this assay provided a flexible, cost-effective, and closed-tube microsatellite genotyping method, well suited to <b>varietal</b> <b>identification</b> and authentication analysis in olive oil...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate ryegrass seedling characteristics that, by themselves, or combined with presently known characters, could improve <b>varietal</b> <b>identification</b> tests. Thirteen characters were studied on 30 varieties of Lolium multiflorum Lam., L. perenne L., L. rigidum Gaud, and L. hybridum Hausskn., including leaf size and area, epidermal characteristics, structural elements, and leaf blade vernation. Mean differences among species occurred in the following characteristics: Lolium multiflorum. and L. perenne: leaf width, leaf length, leaf area, minor and major vascular bundles, lower and upper sclerenchyma fiber groups, hair density, number of vascular bundles, and leaf blade vernation, Lolium multiflorum and L. hybridum; leaf width, leaf length, leaf area and leaf vernation. Lolium perenne and L. hybridum: leaf width, leaf length, leaf area, and total of sclerenchyma fiber groups, and leaf vernation. Lolium perenne and L. rigidum: leaf width, leaf length, leaf area, and leaf vernation. Lolium multiflorum and L. rigidum: leaf blade vernation. Lolium hybridum and L. rigidum: leaf blade vernation. Tetraploids and diploids were significantly different on the average, within their respective species, as follows: Lolium multiflorum: leaf width, leaf length, leaf area, stomata density. Lolium perenne: leaf width, leaf length, leaf area, stomata density. Lolium hybridum: stomata density, and number of major vascular bundles. Some significant differences among varieties within species and ploidy levels were observed in the following characteristics: Lolium multiflorum tetraploids: leaf width, leaf length, leaf area, minor vascular bundles. Lolium multiflorum diploids: leaf width, leaf length, leaf area, minor vascular bundles, total vascular bundles. Lolium perenne tetraploids: leaf area. Lolium perenne diploids: leaf length, leaf area, minor vascular bundles. Although varietal means differed for many of the characters, individual plants could not be identified on the basis of a single character. An illustration was prepared to show how a combination of morphological characters might be used in <b>varietal</b> <b>identification.</b> With a table of varietal means for nine characters, only two (Jolanda and Tetrone [...] both tetraploids of L. multiflorum) of the 30 varieties studied were indistinguishable. The leaf blade vernation of Wimmera (L. rigidum) and. Tetrelite (L. hybridum) appeared to be intermediate between that of L. multiflorum and L. perenne. The vernation was folded from the midrib, like in L. perenne, while the edges of the leaf were inrolled and overlapping, somewhat like L. multiflorum. This type of vernation is being called semi-rolled, to conveniently distinguish from "rolled" and "folded"...|$|E
30|$|To be {{attractive}} to the breeding and genetics communities, low-resolution SNP-detection assays must be inexpensive, high-throughput, accurate and require little technical investment. Low-resolution assays are generally custom-designed for a particular population, and {{may be used to}} rapidly assay hundreds or thousands of individuals within a short time window. Genotyping platforms such as the Illumina BeadXpress Reader provide rapid, low-cost 96 or 384 -plex SNP genotyping for a variety of applications, including primary QTL analysis, NIL development and backcross conversion, <b>varietal</b> <b>identification,</b> quality control in the market or as part of germplasm management, to ensure outcrossing or inbreeding in a hybrid rice program, or to fine map a target region in a gene-discovery program. Likewise, the 1, 536 -SNP GoldenGate assay is ideally suited for genomic selection in a breeding program. At this level of resolution, the assay is likely to detect polymorphism across a range of individuals with varying levels of relatedness. It can be used on a large number of individuals over many years if it is well designed and able to capture the essential components of variation in the breeders’ gene pool.|$|E
