5000|$|Neutral {{is usually}} very near to earth potential, usually being earthed {{either at the}} {{distribution}} board or at the substation.

5000|$|A {{four-wire}} system with symmetrical voltages between phase and neutral is obtained when the <b>neutral</b> is connected <b>to</b> the [...] "common star point" [...] of all supply windings.

2500|$|In Europe, Asia, Africa {{and most}} other locations, single phase is common for {{residential}} and small commercial customers. Single phase distribution is less-expensive, because one set of transformers in a substation normally serve a large area with relatively high voltages (usually 230 V) and no local transformers. These have a simple metering equation: Watts = volts x amps, with volts measured from the <b>neutral</b> <b>to</b> the phase wire. In the United States, Canada, and parts of Central and South America similar customers are normally served by three-wire single phase. [...] Three-wire single-phase requires local transformers, as few as one per ten residences, but provides lower, safer voltages at the socket (usually 120 V), and provides two <b>voltages</b> <b>to</b> customers: <b>neutral</b> <b>to</b> phase (usually 120 V), and phase to phase (usually 240 V). [...] Additionally, three-wire customers normally have <b>neutral</b> wired <b>to</b> the zero side of the generator's windings, which gives earthing {{that can be easily}} measured to be safe. These meters have a metering equation of Watts = 0.5 x volts x (amps of phase A - amps of phase B), with volts measured between the phase wires.|$|R
50|$|Stray voltage is {{any case}} of {{undesirable}} elevated electrical potential, but more precise terminology gives {{an indication of}} the source of the <b>voltage.</b> <b>Neutral</b> <b>to</b> earth <b>voltage</b> (NEV) specifically refers to a difference in potential between a locally grounded object and the grounded return conductor, or neutral, of an electrical system. The neutral is theoretically at 0 V potential, as any grounded object, but current flows on the <b>neutral</b> back <b>to</b> the source, somewhat elevating the neutral voltage. NEV is the product of current flowing on the neutral and the finite, non-zero impedance of the neutral conductor between a given point and its source, often a distant substation. NEV differs from accidentally energized objects because it is an unavoidable result of normal system operation, not an accident or a fault in materials or design.|$|R
2500|$|Electrical sockets {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide three electrical {{connections to the}} supply conductors. These are termed neutral, line and earth. [...] Both neutral and line carry current and are defined as live parts. Neutral is usually at or very near to earth potential, being earthed either at the substation or at the service entrance (neutral-to-earth bonding is not permitted in the distribution board/consumer unit). Line (commonly, but technically incorrectly, called live) carries the full supply <b>voltage</b> relative <b>to</b> the <b>neutral.</b> The [...] protective earth connection allows the exposed metal parts of the appliance {{to be connected to}} earth, providing protection to the user should those exposed parts inadvertently come into contact with any live parts within the appliance. [...] Historically, two-pin sockets without earth were used in Britain, but their use is now restricted to sockets specifically designated for shavers and toothbrushes.|$|R
25|$|Electrical sockets {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide either {{two or three}} electrical connections to the supply conductors. Two-pin sockets normally provide neutral and line connections, both of which carry current and are defined as live parts.

Line (also known as phase or hot, and commonly, but technically incorrectly, as live) carries the full supply <b>voltage</b> relative <b>to</b> the <b>neutral</b> (and <b>to</b> earth). Three-pin sockets provide, in addition, a protective earth connection for exposed metal parts of an appliance. If internal insulation should fail, a short-circuit to the earthed exposed metal parts will hold them at a low potential, and should operate fuses or circuit breakers to isolate the faulty appliance from the supply. Depending on the supply system, some sockets may have two line connections, each at significant <b>voltage</b> <b>to</b> earth and without a neutral pin; for example, a split phase system may have 240V between line connections each at 120V with respect to earth ground; but a single-phase receptacle connected to a three-phase system may have, for example, 208V between contacts and only 120V between each contact and earth ground.|$|R

40|$|Power {{quality is}} related with any {{problems}} from supply voltage, current or frequency deviation {{which can cause}} device failure or performance dropping. In recent years, both electric utility and customer very concern about power quality changing because of some reasons such as more load devices are more sensitive to it than past time. Therefore, there is demand of power quality monitoring system which encouraged by the need of improving system power quality performance. This final project is purposed to arrange monitoring system that consists of resistive voltage dividers, clamp-on current transformers, data acquisition devices (DAQ) SCXI and monitoring program which is designed by using graphical programming language LabVIEW 8. 6. Parameters which are used as monitoring basis are 3 phase <b>voltage</b> signals <b>to</b> <b>neutral</b> (Van, Vbn, Vcn), <b>neutral</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>to</b> ground (Vng), 3 phase current signals and neutral current (Ia, Ib, Ic, In). Monitoring {{can be carried out}} based on either real signal or simulation signal which can be used for power quality study. Monitoring results can be compared with power quality standard to detect deviation. Afterwards it is can be saved in different formats. Measurement result testing was undertaken by comparing measurement result of monitoring system with power quality analyzer Analyst 3 Q which is used as reference. Testing result shows that measurement results with small error are voltage, current, frequency, phase angle cos phi, active power, apparent power, voltage unbalance factor and low order harmonics measurement whereas measurement results with high error are reactive power and high order harmonics. These errors are caused by some factors such as current transformers phase angle shift and the existence of Low Pass Filter in analog module input. Testing of other program functions, which are data saver and recorder, event detector, alarm and report generator, showed quite good result.
