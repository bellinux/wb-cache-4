50|$|Viewership {{of early}} NBC {{broadcasts}} was tightly restricted to those {{authorized by the}} company, whose installed set base eventually reached about 200. Technical standards for television broadcasting were in flux as well. Between the time experimental transmissions began in 1935 {{and the beginning of}} commercial television service in 1941, picture definition increased from 343 to 441 lines, and finally (in 1941) to the 525-line standard used for analog television from the start of full commercial service until the end of analog broadcasts in mid-2009. The sound signal also was changed from AM to FM, and the spacing of sound and <b>vision</b> <b>carriers</b> was also changed several times. Shortly after NBC began a semi-regular television transmission schedule in 1938, DuMont Laboratories announced TV sets for sale to the public, a move that RCA was saving for the opening of the World's Fair on April 30, 1939, the day that regularly scheduled television programming was to begin in New York on NBC with much fanfare. In response, NBC ceased all TV broadcasting for several weeks until RCA sets went on sale and regular NBC telecasts commenced the day the fair opened.|$|R

50|$|Because {{of the low}} {{signal-to-noise}} ratio, as with amateur-radio practice, EME signals can generally only {{be detected}} using narrow-band receiving systems. This means that the only aspect of the TV signal that could be detected is the field scan modulation (AM <b>vision</b> <b>carrier).</b> FM broadcast signals also feature wide frequency modulation, hence EME reception is generally not possible. There are no published records of VHF/UHF EME amateur radio contacts using FM.|$|E
50|$|The above {{description}} {{assumes that}} the waveform of the transmitter being exploited possesses a usable radar ambiguity function and hence cross-correlation yields a useful result. Some broadcast signals, such as analogue television, contain a structure in the time domain that yields a highly ambiguous or inaccurate result when cross-correlated. In this case, the processing described above is ineffective. If the signal contains a continuous wave (CW) component, however, such as a strong carrier tone, then {{it is possible to}} detect and track targets in an alternative way. Over time, moving targets will impose a changing Doppler shift and direction of arrival on the CW tone that is characteristic of the location, speed and heading of the target. It is therefore possible to use a non-linear estimator to estimate the state of the target from the time history of the Doppler and bearing measurements. Work has been published that has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach for tracking aircraft using the <b>vision</b> <b>carrier</b> of analogue television signals. However, track initiation is slow and difficult, and so the use of narrow band signals is probably best considered as an adjunct to the use of illuminators with better ambiguity surfaces.|$|E

An analytical model of ABA-stacked trilayer graphene nanoribbon carrier statistics as a fundamental parameter of field effect transistor (FET) in corporation with a numerical solution is presented in the degenerate and non-degenerate limits. The simulated results {{based on the}} presented model indicate that the model can be approximated by degenerate and non-degenerate approximations in some numbers of normalised Fermi energy. Analytical model specifies that carrier concentration in degenerate limit is strongly independent of normalised Fermi energy; however, in the non-degenerate limit, it is a strong function of normalised Fermi energy. The proposed model is then compared with other types of graphene. As a result, the developed model can assist in comprehending experiments involving trilayer graphene nanoribbon FET-based devices...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWhen an undulating surface {{bearing a}} painted texture is {{illuminated}} the resulting shading pattern produces in-phase modulations {{of the mean}} luminance (LM) and luminance amplitude (AM) of the texture. Experimentally, in-phase combinations of LM and AM (LM+AM) are seen as undulating surfaces whereas anti-phase combinations (LM−AM) are more ambiguous; being seen as undulating when presented alone but as flat when presented in a plaid with LM+AM. AM is a second-order cue and its influence on shape-from-shading can be explained with a bottom-up layer decomposition model containing second-order mechanisms. However, the role of second-order vision in layer decomposition has not been established. If second-order vision is involved in layer decomposition then the perceptual differences between LM+AM and LM−AM should depend on {{the properties of the}} carrier texture {{in a way that is}} consistent with the known properties of second-order vision. Here we find a preference for carrier frequencies 3 octaves above the modulation frequency and take this as an indication that second-order (filter-rectify-filter) mechanisms are involved in processing our LM/AM mixes. We introduce a modified model which takes into account the selectivity of second-order <b>vision</b> for <b>carrier</b> frequency...|$|R
50|$|To send a {{television}} picture in colour across a radio link requires {{at least a}} camera, a transmitter, a receiver, a suitable antenna (aerial) and a monitor (TV). The camera provides the picture and the transmitter sends the picture. The transmitter must produce adequate power at microwave frequencies. The receiver must be sensitive at the frequency in use and decode the vision and sound signals. Things that {{can be added to}} these basic “blocks” are: multiple cameras, vision captions and effects. The expansion of {{a television}} system is almost boundless, a fully equipped ATV studio (and some amateurs do have these) can come later. In the UK all bands from 70 cm upwards are available for ATV. In the 23 cm band and above the standard mode of transmission for ATV is frequency modulation of the <b>vision</b> <b>carrier</b> with a 6 MHz FM audio sub-carrier. The UK ATV calling and talkback frequency is 144.75 MHz FM. Listen or put out a “CQ ATV” call to make initial contact. A licence issued by your national authority is required to operate a television transmitting station, licence conditions will vary in different counties — in the UK this is administered by OFCOM.|$|E

Thus even an unusually crisp [...] "standard" [...] definition (or slightly soft 405-line) image only needed half, or even one-quarter the vision bandwidth of the 819-line system to give a [...] "balanced" [...] appearance, despite their lower overall resolution still seeming perfectly clear on the more affordable small-screen receivers often used in the pre-color era. With the usual additions of sound carrier and vestigial sideband the result was a combined signal that demanded approximately two to three times the bandwidth of more moderately specified standards, even when colour was added to them (as the color subcarrier resides within the luma signal space).|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Visual {{discrimination}} skills, like discrimination {{of motion}} and colour, improve throughout adolescence in normal trichromats. Some adult carriers of red-green colour vision deficiencies exhibit reduced colour discrimination, but {{little is known}} about colour discrimination abilities in young carriers. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the colour discrimination abilities of young obligatory carriers. Methods: 100 normal trichromatic females (aged 18. 28 (± 7. 11) years) and 30 obligatory carriers of red-green colour vision deficiencies (8 protan carriers and 22 deutan carriers, aged 32. 07 (± 15. 5) years) were tested with a battery of colour vision tests comprising Ishihara (24 pl. ed.), Hardy-Rand-Rittler 4 thed. (HRR 2002), Neitz Test of Color Vision (NTCV), Cambridge Colour Test (CCT), Farnsworth- 100 -Hue Test (FM 100 -Hue), HMC anomaloscope (both Rayleigh and Moreland matches) and Medmont C- 100. The results are presented for four different age groups (9 - 12, 18 - 29, 30 - 39 and 40 +). Results: Carriers aged 9 - 12 years failed the pseudoisochromatic (PIC) tests more often than their normal trichromatic peers. These tests were failed by 80 % of deutan carriers and 50 % of protan carriers, but only 20 % of normal trichromats in the same age group. These figures decreased to 75 %, 20 % and 12 %, respectively, in the 30 - 39 year age group. Colour discrimination, as assessed by the FM 100 -Hue test, improved with age for both groups, but the carriers’ performance was, on average, poorer than that of normal trichromats. Variability in the FM 100 -Hue error scores was significantly greater for the 9 - 12 year age group, compared to the three older age groups, both for normal trichromats and for carriers. Protan carriers required, on average, more red and deutan carriers required more green, compared to normal trichromatic females, when tested on the Rayleigh match and the Medmont C- 100 tests. However, the Medmont C- 100 failed to identify protan and deutan carriers amongst the normal trichromats and the null-point settings of all three groups overlapped considerably. Conclusion: The results imply that some young female carriers may have exacerbated problems with colour discrimination due to the combined effects of being a carrier and having an immature visual system. The improvement in colour discrimination with age seen in normal trichromats is also evident in carriers of red-green colour <b>vision</b> deficiencies. Deutan <b>carriers</b> scored significantly worse on the colour vision tests used, which shows that they have poorer colour <b>vision</b> than protan <b>carriers.</b> The results from the Rayleigh anomaloscope and the Medmont C- 100 tests imply that it may be possible to classify known obligate carriers as either protan or deutan carriers...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} if asymptomatic carriers from a previously identified large pedigree of the Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) 11778 mtDNA mutation have colour vision deficits. Methods: As {{part of a}} comprehensive analysis of over 200 members of a large Brazilian LHON pedigree spanning seven generations, colour vision tests were obtained from 91 members. Colour vision was tested one eye at a time using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 (FM- 100) hue colour vision test. the test was administered under uniform conditions, taking into account: ambient light levels, daylight colour temperature of 6700 kelvin, and neutral uniform background. Tests were scored using the FM- 100 MS-Excel computer scoring program. Defects were determined and categorised as tritan, deutan, or protan. Categorisation of each dyschromatopsia was based on review of demonstrated axis computer generated plots and age adjusted error scores which coincided with Verriest 95 % confidence intervals. Only the axis with the greatest magnitude error score was used to classify the defect. 55 of the 91 test subjects were LHON mtDNA 11778 J haplotype mutation carriers, proved by mtDNA analysis. the remaining 36 subjects were age matched non-blood relatives (off pedigree), who served as controls. Results: 27 of 55 carriers (49. 10 %) were shown to have colour vision defects in one or both eyes. 13 of the 27 (48 %) abnormal tests in the carrier group were tritan defects and the remaining 14 (52 %) were deutan defects. Nine of the 27 (33 %) abnormals in the carrier group were identified as having bilateral defects. Six of these were deutan, and the remaining three were tritan dyschromatopsias. Only six of the 36 (16. 66 %) age matched controls were found to have any type of dyschromatopsia. Five (83. 3 %) of these were deutan defects. the remaining one was a tritan defect. {{the difference between the two}} groups using alpha chi (2) test with one degree of freedom was statistically significant with a p value less that 0. 001. Conclusions: Until now, LHON has always been characterised by a sudden, devastating <b>vision</b> loss. Asymptomatic <b>carriers,</b> those without <b>vision</b> loss, were considered unaffected by the disease. It now appears that asymptomatic carriers of the LHON mutation are affected by colour vision defects and may manifest other subtle, yet chronic, changes.

40|$|Arent Passer is {{an artist}} who was {{discovered}} for art history by Sten Karling in 1938, and who since that time has merited ever greater attention. Both Helmi Üprus and Krista Kodres have written about Passer. The author has also touched {{on the subject of}} Passer in his previous writings, this primarily in connection with the House of the Black Heads in Tallinn, Passer’s  position as a stonemason and town architect, and his workshop located in Tallinn’s Kalamaja suburb. In this article, a closer examination is made of Tallinn’s opus magnum of the Renaissance era – the sepulchral monument of Pontus de la Gardie – several aspects of which still provoke questions, despite the repeated attention it has already received. First of all, the article focuses on the topic of death and its various interpretations during the spiritual and cultural period of transition from the Middle Ages to the modern era, in the course of which various religious and cultural impulses did not succeed each other, but existed simultaneously. This provides an opportunity to read the monument by using the death cult and its  Augustinian tradition as a point of departure along with the reform-minded changes of the modern era, thereby linking the verbal and pictorial programmes with two different representations of death – in the eternal and temporal field of <b>vision.</b> The primary <b>carrier</b> of the monument’s  ideological message is the spirit of the Renaissance, which invests {{in the role of the}} individual and his genius, with the focus of attention in this case being one of the greatest heroes of the era – Pontus de la Gardie and his famous victories on the battlefield. Along with an emphasis on the denial of the body, deformation and decomposition typical of the Late Middle Ages, as well as the freeing and salvation of the soul, the visual rhetoric of the monument addresses the humanist era man and his humane nature, which is displayed on the monument by a dominant imagery based on the classics of Antiquity. A sign of the latter is the composition based on  architectural order and the allegories Spes and Fides, which is utilised in the cenotaph designed to be an altar-like triptych. Similarly the dominant emblems of victory on the sarcophagus originate from a widespread and updated field of art, the geography of which stretches from Italy to  Burgundy, Flanders, Antwerp and finally Tallinn. Arent Passer was the first emissary in the Baltics of the Mannerism that developed as a late phase ofthe Renaissance, and the origins, and most probably also early years, of which are associated with the style and workshop of Cornelis Floris and the masters that grew out of it – from Willem Boy to Philip Brandin, who fulfilled large-scale commissions in various royal courts. The patron of both the Gustav Vasa and Pontus de la Gardie monuments was Johann III, King of Sweden, which provides an opportunity to seek and discover connections in the developed circle related to the artist’s style, choice of motifs and approach to ornamentation. At his most outstanding, Passer attains the level of his distinguished compatriots. Whereas the Passer name alludes most probably to the Passchen family that set out from Antwerp, the most distinguished member of which was Henri de Paschen, the builder of the Royal Exchange in London. After arriving in Tallinn, Arent Passer spent more than forty industrious years there. During his time in the former Hanseatic town imbued with the traditions of the past, his work loses its initial brilliance, the three-dimensional plastic approach in sculpture is taken over by bas-reliefs and flat surfaces, and one can increasingly speak of Passer as being tied to the town through his responsibilities as the builder of the town’s fortifications and the head of his workshop. While living in Tallinn, Passer was indisputably not only an authority figure, but also the sole executor of the most important commissions. Conserving his Netherlandish roots, Passer’s workshop repeats the same models through the years, which, in the case of the numerous architectural details that decorate the town (for example, the biforate windows at Rüütli 14), allow us to speak more about a so-called “Passer style” than of the style of an individual artist. His comfortable position as an entrepreneur and elder of the Canute Guild was the reason that Passer rejected an attractive offer to move to Stockholm and return to the paths of his youth, where the design and execution of sepulchral monuments had become one of the main themes of religious devotion in the new age. Where, as we know, there was no lack of highly qualified masters. It is not impossible that, like the Gustav Vasa monument in Uppsala, the Pontus de la Gardie monument in Tallinn was also completed in the Netherlands. The precondition for the next study of Passer is a comparison of the monument’s style and technique with that of an artistically ambitious circle of stonemasons, whose workshops were located somewhere between Antwerp, Maline, Hague and Danzig, where talent and experience abounded. Rising above the slavish imitation of architectural graphics that was widespread at the time, Passer {{is an artist}} whose genius deserves not only to be recorded, but to be studied further...|$|R
