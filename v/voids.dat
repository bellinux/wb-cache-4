5|$|The {{detailed}} {{design for the}} project was completed during summer 2006 and construction began in January 2007. The first task was to build a stable access road, but the moor was covered in a layer of peat with a low load-bearing capacity. The whole area had also been subjected to extensive coal mining during the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{so there was a}} potential for subsidence. To address these problems, the mining <b>voids</b> were grouted and a floating road was constructed, using a complex system of geotextiles and geogrids to prevent the road from sinking. This was achieved by laying a crushed-gravel base, reinforced with polyester and polypropylene grids, to bridge any potential mine <b>voids</b> and ensure that the weak shear strength of the subsoil was exceeded by the base course material.|$|E

5|$|The funding {{produced}} by the Battleship Texas Commission was {{not up to the}} task of maintaining the ship. Consequently, years of neglect resulted in cracks and gaps in coated surfaces, water intrusion, and steel deterioration. Paint in interior spaces began to crack, then flake, exposing metal surfaces underneath, which began to rust. At the same time, pipes open to the sea ultimately failed, flooding various <b>voids</b> and bunkers.|$|E
5|$|After initial cutting, {{the diamond}} is shaped in {{numerous}} stages of polishing. Unlike cutting, {{which is a}} responsible but quick operation, polishing removes material by gradual erosion and is extremely time consuming. The associated technique is well developed; it is considered as a routine and can be performed by technicians. After polishing, the diamond is reexamined for possible flaws, either remaining or induced by the process. Those flaws are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques, such as repolishing, crack filling, or clever arrangement of the stone in the jewelry. Remaining non-diamond inclusions are removed through laser drilling and filling of the <b>voids</b> produced.|$|E
5|$|Several {{options were}} {{implemented}} {{to increase the}} bridge's lifespan.

5|$|The {{properties}} of thorium vary widely {{depending on the}} degree of impurities in the sample. The major impurity is usually thorium dioxide (ThO2); even the purest thorium specimens usually contain about a tenth of a percent of the dioxide. Experimental measurements of its density give values between 11.5and11.66g/cm3: these are slightly lower than the theoretically expected value of 11.7g/cm3 calculated from thorium's lattice parameters, perhaps due to microscopic <b>voids</b> forming in the metal when it is cast. These values lie between those of its neighbours actinium (10.1g/cm3) and protactinium (15.4g/cm3), part of a trend across the early actinides.|$|E
5|$|This highly {{hypothetical}} {{picture of}} the flux tube exchange was partly confirmed by the Galileo spacecraft, which detected regions of sharply reduced plasma density and increased field strength in the inner magnetosphere. These <b>voids</b> may correspond to the almost empty flux tubes arriving from the outer magnetosphere. In the middle magnetosphere, Galileo detected so-called injection events, which occur when hot plasma from the outer magnetosphere impacts the magnetodisk, leading to increased flux of energetic particles and a strengthened magnetic field. No mechanism is yet known to explain the transport of cold plasma outward.|$|E
5|$|Enter the <b>Voids</b> {{post-production}} process lasted {{more than}} a year. Work on the digital effects was led by Pierre Buffin of BUF Compagnie. Every scene in the film includes computer-generated imagery (CGI)—even the flashback scenes, where the backdrops were digitally altered. Studio scenes, helicopter shots, and CGI were forged together in the hovering sequences with the intention that the viewer should be unable to determine which is which. For shots from high altitudes, the team started with helicopter footage from video, and then created computer models of the neighbourhoods with textures from photographs. Neon lights, reflections, and dark areas were consistently accentuated. Flickers were created through a mixture of motion blur, chromatic aberration, and focus effects. For scenes seen as through a fisheye lens, the team recreated the sets digitally and progressively increased the environments' reflection values along with the lens effect.|$|E

5|$|Estimates put {{the average}} energy {{density of the}} Universe at the {{equivalent}} of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters. The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast <b>voids</b> that have much lower density, {{at least in terms}} of visible matter. Unlike the matter and dark matter, the dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Leggetts Creek sometimes exceeds its total maximum daily load, especially during low flow conditions and the summer months. There are some mine drainage issues on the creek between Rockwell Avenue and Charles Street. It experiences some flow loss to underground mine <b>voids.</b> In 1978, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (now known as the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection) estimated that the creek lost 20 to 30 percent of its flow to mines during dry weather. However, the creek is large enough that this does not cause aquatic habitat to be lost. The Chinchilla sewage treatment plant discharges into the creek {{in the vicinity of}} Leggetts Gap. In its lower reaches, the creek is impacted by past mining, urban development, and debris. Stormwater also flows into the Lackawanna River via the creek and it is affected by fine sediment. There is one stormwater detention facility in the watershed, at Leggett's Creek Estates.|$|E
5|$|The analog {{technique}} {{is a complex}} way of making a forecast, requiring the forecaster to remember a previous weather event {{that is expected to}} be mimicked by an upcoming event. What makes it a difficult technique to use is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event in the future. Some call this type of forecasting pattern recognition. It remains a useful method of observing rainfall over data <b>voids</b> such as oceans, as well as the forecasting of precipitation amounts and distribution in the future. A similar {{technique is}} used in medium range forecasting, which is known as teleconnections, when systems in other locations are used to help pin down the location of another system within the surrounding regime. An example of teleconnections are by using El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related phenomena.|$|E

5|$|The {{precious}} metals {{silver and gold}} were not common in the Eastern Ranges, while copper was mined in Gachantivá, Moniquirá and in {{the mountains to the}} south of the Bogotá savanna at Sumapaz. The process of elaborating the fine filigree figures took place by creating a mold of obsidian, shale or clay, filling the open space with bee wax, obtained through trade with the neighbouring indigenous peoples from the Llanos Orientales to the east of the Altiplano; the Achagua, Tegua and Guayupe. The bee wax occupied the <b>voids</b> of the mold and the mold was heated by fires. The bee wax would melt, leaving an open space where the tumbaga or sometimes gold was poured into, a process called lost-wax casting. Using this method, modern tunjos are still fabricated in the centre of Bogotá.|$|E
5|$|Twin helical strands {{form the}} DNA backbone. Another double helix {{may be found}} tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These <b>voids</b> are {{adjacent}} to the base pairs and may provide a binding site. As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22Å wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12Å wide. The width of the major groove means that {{the edges of the}} bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove. As a result, proteins such as transcription factors that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contact with the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove. This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell (see below), but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{invasiveness}} {{and exposure}} to radiation in <b>voiding</b> cystourethrography led {{to the introduction of}} alternative methods of diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux, including contrast enhanced <b>voiding</b> urosonography.

This study is aimed at assessing agreement between contrast enhanced <b>voiding</b> urosonography with second-generation ultrasound contrast agents and <b>voiding</b> cystourethrography. Methods: From April 2013 to May 2014, 83 children (37 female and 46 male), mean age 3. 5 years, age range from 1 month to 17. 5 years, underwent prospective simultaneous assessment by contrast enhanced <b>voiding</b> urosonography and <b>voiding</b> cystourethrography, with a total of 166 uretero-renal units evaluated. Results: The sensitivity of <b>voiding</b> cystourethrography and contrast enhanced <b>voiding</b> urosonography were comparable, amounting to 88 %, however, neither reached 100 % for the entire studied population. The negative predictive value of <b>voiding</b> urosonography and <b>voiding</b> cystourethrography was 97 %, and {{there was no difference between}} both methods.
