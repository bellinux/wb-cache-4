As accessibility declines, water becomes a critical factor defining the price of land. Pricing rural land generally includes several factors.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the differential cost of rural land due to the availability of water, by considering at different methods that are used to value rural properties in Mexico: valuation of physical mass appraisal, comparable method, profits productivity method, and income capitalization method.

40|$|Environmental {{research}} has been increasing due to growing diverse environmental concerns regarding sustainability, climate change, natural resource depletion, waste management, and air and noise pollution. Economic valuation of environmental research can assist in guiding research planning and expenditure. Yet environmental research is difficult to evaluate due to the dominance of non-market benefits and difficulties identifying tangible outputs and outcomes from research. This paper attempts to apply an existing valuation framework to an empirical case study to examine the difficulties and limitations of economic valuations of environmental research. In the empirical case study environmental research and other technical and managerial inputs were used to develop a policy output. Policy implementation will result in environmental outcomes with subsequent economic benefits. The primary {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore the complexities and limitations of valuing environmental research, in particular the counterfactual and uncertainty. Section 2 outlines the generic framework for valuing environmental research. Section 3 describes the <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> <b>used</b> in this empirical analysis. Section 4 provides background to the case study and applies the chosen method to value the environmental research. The limitations encountered during the assessment are highlighted in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes with final comments regarding economic valuations of environmental research.

40|$|Objective: Cost-utility {{analysis}} {{is widely used}} in high-income countries to inform decisions on efficient health care resource allocation. Cost-utility analysis uses the quality-adjusted life-year as the outcome measure of health. High-income countries have undertaken health state valuation (HSV) studies to determine country specific utility weights to facilitate valuation of health-related quality of life. Despite an evident need, however, the extent of HSVs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is unclear. Methods: The literature was searched systematically by using four databases and additional Web searches to identify HSV studies carried out in LMICs. The Preferred Reporting System for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) strategy was followed to ensure systematic selection of the articles. Results: The review identified 17 HSV studies from LMICs. Twelve studies were undertaken in upper middle-income countries, while lower middle- and low-income countries contributed three and two studies, respectively. There were 7 generic HSV and 10 disease-specific HSV studies.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} effects that {{different}} economic instruments to reward carbon sequestration services might have on forest management, especially on the optimal rotation period. Three different carbon crediting schemes are considered, {{which are based on}} different accounting rules. The schemes are different with respect to the question whether and how to account for carbon emissions. The forest <b>valuation</b> <b>method</b> <b>used</b> for calculation is based on the land expectation value (LEV), which was adjusted for the value of carbon sequestration services. Changes in the LEV and optimal rotation are expected to be induced by the amount and interactions of carbon and timber prices, harvesting and regeneration costs, and interest rates. The optimal economic rotation period is calculated for single stands as well as for whole forest enterprises (fully regulated "normal" forests). Crediting the carbon sequestration of single stands [...] starting from the time of regeneration [...] is comparable to rewarding afforestation projects. When crediting forest enterprises with existing timber and carbon stocks, additional carbon sequestration compared to a reference is rewarded. The findings reveal that, depending on the carbon price level, the optimal rotation period is increased in all considered crediting schemes, but with different intensity. If wood removals have to be accounted as carbon emissions this has the most significant effect on the optimal rotation period for forest stands and enterprises. In this case the increase of the optimal rotation period by rising carbon prices is boosted additionally by rising interest rates. Different thinning regimes, however, have only little impact on the time of maximum LEV under carbon crediting schemes.
