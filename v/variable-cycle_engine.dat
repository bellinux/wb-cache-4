50|$|Engine {{development}} for sixth generation fighters is already underway {{to be more}} efficient in making jets faster and giving them a longer range. While current engines operate best at a single point in the flight envelope, newer engines could vary their bypass ratios for optimum efficiency at any speed or altitude. That would give an aircraft a much greater range, faster acceleration, and greater subsonic cruise efficiency. A <b>variable-cycle</b> <b>engine</b> could configure itself {{to act like a}} turbojet at supersonic speeds, while performing like a high-bypass turbofan for efficient cruising at slower speeds; the ability to supercruise may not be a critical requirement, but it will likely be able to with the engine type. One critical component is the adaptive fan to allow the engine to vary its bypass ratio depending on altitude and speed with a third stream of air to increase or decrease the bypass ratio. A low-bypass configuration would be used for take offs and supersonic flight, and a high-bypass configuration would have high propulsive efficiency for cruising. The U.S. Navy and Air Force have different sixth generation fighter development programs, but both services are working together on engine development. The Air Force is aiming for a Milestone A decision by 2018, with a production version to be ready possibly by 2021. Companies involved with next-generation engine development include General Electric and Pratt & Whitney.|$|E

The prospects for advanced technology suggest that a high lift-to-drag-ratio configuration incorporating advanced materials and control concepts and utilizing a <b>variable-cycle</b> <b>engine</b> or perhaps an advanced dry turbojet, will yield an advanced supersonic transport which is economically viable and socially acceptable. Hydrogen fuel offers great promise for future supersonic aircraft, however, the formidable problems {{associated with the use of}} such fuel probably precludes its use on any near term second-generation supersonic transport.

40|$|Study of {{two-dimensional}} and axisymmetric supersonic mixed-compression inlet {{systems has}} shown that the geometry of both systems can be varied to provide adequate transonic airflow to satisfy the airflow demand of most jet engines. Collapsing geometry systems for both types of inlet systems provide a generous amount of transonic airflow for any design Mach number inlet system. However, the mechanical practicality of collapsing centerbodies for axisymmetric inlet systems is doubtful. Therefore, translating centerbody axisymmetric inlets with auxiliary airflow systems to augment the transonic airflow capability are an attractive alternative. Estimates show that the capture mass-flow ratio at Mach number 1. 0 can be increased approximately 0. 20 for a very short axisymmetric inlet system designed for Mach number 2. 37. With this increase in mass-flow ratio, even <b>variable-cycle</b> <b>engine</b> transonic airflow demand can be matched without oversizing the inlet at the design Mach number...|$|E
40|$|NASA-SCAR (AST) {{program was}} {{initiated}} in 1972 at the direct {{request of the}} Executive Office of the White House and Congress following termination of the U. S. SST program. The purpose of SCR was to conduct a focused research and technology program on those technology programs which contributed to the SST termination and, also, to provide an expanded data base for future civil and military supersonic transport aircraft. Funding for the Supersonic Cruise Research (SCR) Program was initiated in fiscal year 1973 and terminated in fiscal year 1981. The program was implemented through contracts and grants with industry, universities, and by in-house investigations at the NASA/OAST centers. The studies included system studies and five disciplines: propulsion, stratospheric emissions impact, materials and structures, aerodynamic performance, and stability and control. The NASA/Lewis <b>Variable-Cycle</b> <b>Engine</b> (VCE) Component Program was initiated in 1976 to augment the SCR program {{in the area of}} propulsion.

40|$|NASA and the U. S. {{aerospace}} industry have been assessing the economic viability and environmental acceptability of a second-generation supersonic civil transport, or High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT). Development of a propulsion system that satisfies strict airport noise regulations and provides {{high levels of}} cruise and transonic performance with adequate takeoff performance, at an acceptable weight, {{is critical to the}} success of any HSCT program. The principal objectives were to: 1. Develop a preliminary design of an innovative 2 -D exhaust nozzle with the goal of meeting FAR 36 Stage III noise levels and providing high levels of cruise performance with a high specific thrust for Mach 2. 4 HSCT with a range of 5000 nmi and a payload of 51, 900 lbm, 2. Employ advanced acoustic and aerodynamic codes during preliminary design, 3. Develop a comprehensive acoustic and aerodynamic database through scale-model testing of low-noise, high-performance, 2 -D nozzle configurations, based on the preliminary design, and 4.

40|$|This year, {{the senior}} level Aerospace Design class at Case Western Reserve University {{developed}} a conceptual {{design of a}} supersonic business transport. Due to the growing trade between Asia and the United States, a transpacific range has been chosen for the aircraft. A Mach number of 2. 2 was chosen too because it provides reasonable block times and allows {{the use of a}} large range of materials without a need for active cooling. A payload of 2500 lbs. has been assumed corresponding to a complement of nine (passengers and crew) plus some light cargo. With these general requirements set, the class was broken down into three groups. The aerodynamics of the aircraft were the responsibility of the first group. The second developed the propulsion system. The efforts of both the aerodynamics and propulsion groups were monitored and reviewed for weight considerations and structural feasibility by the third group. Integration of the design required considerable interaction between the groups in the final stages. The fuselage length of the final conceptual design was 107. 0 ft. while the diameter of the fuselage was 7. 6 ft. The delta wing design consisted of an aspect ratio of 1. 9 with a wing span of 47. 75 ft and midcord length of 61. 0 ft.

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{internal}} combustion engine with distinct advantages over conventional piston-engines and gas turbines in small power ranges is presented. The engine has analogies with piston engine operation, but like gas turbines it has dedicated spaces and devices for compression, burning and expansion. The engine operates on a modified limited-pressure thermodynamic cycle. The core of the engine is a nutating non-rotating disk, with the center of its hub mounted {{in the middle of}} a Z-shaped shaft. The two ends of the shaft rotate, while the disk nutates. The motion of the disk circumference prescribes a portion of a sphere. In the single-disk configuration a portion of the surface area of the disk is used for intake and compression, a portion is used to seal against a center casing, and the remaining portion is used for expansion and exhaust. The compressed air is admitted to an external accumulator, and then into an external combustion chamber before it is admitted to the power side of the disk. The external combustion chamber enables the engine to operate on a variable compression ratio cycle. Variations in cycle temperature ratio and compression ratio during normal operation enable the engine to effectively become a <b>variable-cycle</b> <b>engine,</b> allowing significant flexibility for optimizing efficiency or power output. The thermal efficiency is similar to that of medium sized diesel engines. For the same engine volume and weight this engine produces approximately twice the power of a two-stroke engine and four times the power of a four-stroke engine. The computed sea-level engine performance at design and off-design conditions in the 2 to 500 Â kW power range is presented.

40|$|A systems {{analysis}} was performed with experimental jet noise data, engine/aircraft performance codes and aircraft noise prediction codes to assess takeoff noise levels and mission range for conceptual supersonic commercial aircraft. A parametric study was done to identify viable engine cycles that meet NASAs N+ 2 goals for noise and performance. Model scale data from offset jets was used as input to the aircraft noise prediction code to determine the expected sound levels for the lateral certification point where jet noise dominates over all other noise sources. The noise predictions {{were used to determine}} the optimal orientation of the offset nozzles to minimize the noise at the lateral microphone location. An alternative takeoff procedure called programmed lapse rate was evaluated for noise reduction benefits. Results show {{there are two types of}} engines that provide acceptable range performance; one is a standard mixed-flow turbofan with a single-stage fan, and the other is a three-stream <b>variable-cycle</b> <b>engine</b> with a multi-stage fan. The engine with a single-stage fan has a lower specific thrust and is 8 to 10 EPNdB quieter for takeoff. Offset nozzles reduce the noise directed toward the thicker side of the outer flow stream, but have less benefit as the core nozzle pressure ratio is reduced and the bypass-to-core area ratio increases. At the systems level for a three-engine N+ 2 aircraft with full throttle takeoff, there is a 1. 4 EPNdB margin to Chapter 3 noise regulations predicted for the lateral certification point (assuming jet noise dominates). With a 10 reduction in thrust just after takeoff rotation, the margin increases to 5. 5 EPNdB. Margins to Chapter 4 and Chapter 14 levels will depend on the cumulative split between the three certification points, but it appears that low specific thrust engines with a 10 reduction in thrust (programmed lapse rate) can come close to meeting Chapter 14 noise levels. Further noise reduction is possible with additional reduction in takeoff thrust using programmed lapse rate, but studies are needed to investigate the practical limits for safety and takeoff regulations...|$|E
40|$|The {{nutating}} {{engine is}} {{a new type of}} internal combustion engine with distinct advantages over conventional piston engines and gas turbines in small power ranges. The engine's unique arrangement flexibility allows several alternative disk and shaft configurations, each selected for a different application. Variations in cycle temperature ratio and compression ratio during normal operation enable the engine to effectively become a <b>variable-cycle</b> <b>engine,</b> allowing significant flexibility for maximum efficiency or power or other optimizing function for on-ground stationary or for airborne applications. In its basic configuration the core of the engine is a nutating nonrotating disk, with the center of its hub mounted {{in the middle of a}} Z-shaped shaft. The two ends of the shaft rotate, while the disk "nutates," performs a wobbling motion without rotating around its axis. The motion of the disk circumference prescribes a portion of a sphere. A portion of the area of the disk is used for intake and compression, a portion is used to seal against a center casing, and the remaining portion is used for expansion and exhaust. The compressed air is admitted to an external accumulator and then into an external combustion chamber before it is admitted to the power side of the disk. A companion paper examines the performance potential of the one-disk engine. This paper examines alternative engine configurations. The external combustion chamber enables the engine to operate on a variable compression ratio cycle. In addition, separate disks of unequal size are used for intake and expansion, resulting in distinct and significant power efficiency, fuel flexibility, and arrangement advantages over conventional piston engines, over gas turbines, and over the basic nutating-engine configuration. The performance of these arrangements is examined for: on-ground power, on-ground efficiency, (auxiliary power, automotive); and for small and light airframe applications for flight Mach numbers from 0 to 1 and altitudes from 0 to 20 km. This publication is the original presentation of the performance potential of several alternative configurations of the basic engine, such as multidisk arrangements, combustion and exhaust disks of different size, and variable-compression ratio (variable cycle) configurations...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in the development of intelligent engine technology with advanced active component control. The computer engine models used in these control studies are component-level models (CLM), models that link individual component models of state space and nonlinear algebraic equations, written in a computer language such as Fortran. The difficulty faced in performing control studies on Fortran-based models is that Fortran is not supported with control design and analysis tools, so there is no means for implementing real-time control. It is desirable to have a simulation environment that is straightforward, has modular graphical components, and allows easy access to health, control, and engine parameters through a graphical user interface. Such a tool should also provide the ability to convert a control design into real-time code, helping to make it an extremely powerful tool in control and diagnostic system development. Simulation time management is shown: Mach number versus time, power level angle versus time, altitude versus time, ambient temperature change versus time, afterburner fuel flow versus time, controller and actuator dynamics, collect initial conditions, CAD output, and component-level model: CLM sensor, CAD input, and model output. The Controls and Dynamics Technologies Branch at the NASA Glenn Research Center has developed and demonstrated a flexible, generic turbofan engine simulation platform that can meet these objectives, known as the Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (MAPSS). MAPSS is a Simulink-based implementation of a Fortran-based, modern high pressure ratio, dual-spool, low-bypass, military-type <b>variable-cycle</b> <b>engine</b> with a digital controller. Simulink (The Mathworks, Natick, MA) is a computer-aided control design and simulation package allows the graphical representation of dynamic systems in a block diagram form. MAPSS is a nonlinear, non-real-time system composed of controller and actuator dynamics (CAD) and component-level model (CLM) modules. The controller in the CAD module emulates the functionality of a digital controller, which has a typical update rate of 50 Hz. The CLM module simulates the dynamics of the engine components and uses an update rate of 2500 Hz, which is needed to iterate to balance mass and energy among system components. The actuators in the CAD module use the same sampling rate as those in the CLM. Two graphs of normalized spool speed versus time in seconds and one graph of normalized average metal temperature versus time in seconds is shown. MAPSS was validated via open-loop and closed-loop comparisons with the Fortran simulation. The preceding plots show the normalized results of a closed-loop comparison looking at three states of the model: low-pressure spool speed, high-pressure spool speed, and the average metal temperature measured from the combustor to the high-pressure turbine. In steady state, the error between the simulations is less than 1 percent. During a transient, the difference between the simulations is due to a correction in MAPSS that prevents the gas flow in the bypass duct inlet from flowing forward instead of toward the aft end, which occurs in the Fortran simulation. A comparison between MAPSS and the Fortran model of the bypass duct inlet flow for power lever angles greater than 35 degrees is shown...|$|E
