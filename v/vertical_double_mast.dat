40|$|We study level mixing in {{the single}} {{particle}} energy spectrum {{of one of the}} constituent quantum dots in a <b>vertical</b> <b>double</b> quantum dot by performing magneto-resonant-tunneling spectroscopy. The device used in this study differs from previous <b>vertical</b> <b>double</b> quantum dot devices in that the single side gate is now split into four separate gates. Because of the presence of natural perturbations caused by anharmonicity and anistrophy, applying different combinations of voltages to these gates allows us to alter the effective potential landscape of the two dots and hence influence the level mixing. We present here preliminary results from one three level crossing and one four level crossings high up in the energy spectrum of one of the probed quantum dots, and demonstrate that we are able to change significantly the energy dispersions with magnetic field {{in the vicinity of the}} crossing regions.

40|$|Structural {{details are}} {{reported}} for a novel right-handed polynucleotide double helix stabilized by vertical base stacking and hydrogen bonding. The primary {{difference between this}} duplex and the familiar Watson-Crick horizontally stabilized polynucleotide complex arises in the glycosyl rotation of the heterocyclic bases {{with respect to the}} sugar-phate backbone. In the <b>vertical</b> <b>double</b> helix the bases adopt a fairly unusual (although not sterically impossible) high-anti conformation, while in the horizontal models deduced from x-ray analyses the bases occur in the favored anti arrangement. The base pairing scheme in both duplexes is the standard Watson-Crick type. The <b>vertical</b> <b>double</b> helix is demonstrated to be a plausible model for the unusual complex formation observed between complementary synthetic polycyclonucleotides (the bases of which are fixed by a chemical linkage in the high-anti orientation) and also a potential alternative ordered structure available to naturally occurring nucleic acid systems that can adopt both anti and high-anti glycosyl arrangements...|$|R
