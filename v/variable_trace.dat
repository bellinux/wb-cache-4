40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an in-depth}} study of weak syllable omissions from polysyllabic words, a phenomenon seen in three quite different English-speaking populations: {{young children with}} normally developing language, older children with specific language impairment (SLI), and adults with types of non-fluent aphasia. The omissions result in forms such as nana for banana, or raffe for giraffe. I first review the main theoretical accounts of weak syllable omissions, which implicate input (perception), production, or grammar (phonology). After concluding that perceptual accounts are inadequate, I propose four studies based on production and grammar accounts of omissions by the populations of interest. Specifically, the studies ask two questions: Are syllables truly deleted? And what is the mechanism behind syllable omissions? Three hypotheses address these questions. The Structure Reduction Hypothesis states that syllables are truly deleted, whereas the Generic Trace and <b>Variable</b> <b>Trace</b> Hypotheses hold that omitted syllables leave a measurable trace. On the Generic Trace Hypothesis, the trace is of generic length, independent of the subsyllabic information, while on the <b>Variable</b> <b>Trace</b> Hypothesis, variation in subsyllabic length affects the trace. In three experiments, children with normal language and SLI were asked to repeat sentences that included words with strong-weak stress patterns and weak-strong-weak patterns, which children reduced to strong-weak outputs. Acoustic analyses of the non-reduced and reduced outputs revealed that children left an acoustic trace in the latter, {{in the form of}} durational lengthening. Lengthening did not vary based on the subsyllabic content of the omitted syllable, supporting the Generic Trace Hypothesis. In addition, the child studies and a word repetition study of adults with aphasia revealed certain phonological factors bearing on the rates of syllable omissions. Based on the four studies, I propose a preliminary model of weak syllable omission that contains factors triggering omissions, multiple paths from the phonology to the phonetic realization, and a developmental continuum of strategies used by children to reach the adult target. In concluding, I suggest that instrumental acoustic analyses are a crucial component to any study addressing variation in children's productions, and I suggest implications of the research for current discussions of the phonetics-phonology interface...|$|E

The d 18 O values of garnet (4. 7 – 6. 8 ‰), determined by laser fluorination on clean mineral separates, extend beyond the range for mantle peridotites. All low MgO eclogites have reconstructed trace element patterns that are depleted in Ba, Th, U, and light rare earth element (LREE), with jadeite-rich samples having more <b>variable</b> <b>trace</b> element patterns than jadeite-poor samples. These observations, coupled with low SiO 2 contents, and Nb-rich but LREE-depleted reconstructed whole rock compositions, suggest the low MgO eclogites are remnants of altered oceanic crust that was partially melted during subduction. Partial melting of a mafic protolith at high pressure (leaving a garnet-bearing residue) is the preferred model to explain the origin of Archean tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) suites, which make up large portions of the crust in Archean cratons. We therefore suggest that the Koidu low MgO eclogites may be residues from Archean continental crust formation. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd 1...|$|E
40|$|Two petrographically {{different}} syenite suites can {{be distinguished}} in the mostly Archean Ntem Complex of Cameroon: a suite of two-pyroxene syenites and a suite of clinopyroxene syenites. The syenites occur as discrete intrusions surrounded by Archean gneisses. Based on structural relationships the syenites are of late to post-orogenic origin. The Pb–Pb zircon evaporation ages indicate that the syenites intruded at ca. 2. 3 Ga and thus postdate significantly the Archean episode of crust formation and differentiation that generated the surrounding gneiss terrane. The isotope signatures and the trace elements provide unambiguous evidence that the two syenite suites are of crustal origin. The syenite suites do not show simple chemical trends, have highly <b>variable</b> <b>trace</b> element contents and display only a small variation in their major element contents, particularly in their SiO 2 contents. The isotope characteristics, including 143 Nd/ 144 Nd, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and common Pb, point to a heterogeneous source or multiple sources for the syenites.

The major element composition of the investigated lavas is mainly controlled by fractional crystallization of olivine, clinopyroxene, Fe^Ti oxides and apatite; feldspar fractionation is restricted to the most evolved lavas. Na 2 O and SiO 2 variations within uncon-taminated, primitive lavas as well as variably fractionated {{heavy rare earth element}} ratios suggest a formation by variable degrees of partial melting of different garnet peridotite sources triggered, probably, by changes in mantle temperature. The isotopic range as well as the <b>variable</b> <b>trace</b> element enrichment observed in the lavas imply derivation from both a volatile- and incompatible element-enriched asthenosphere and from a plume component. In addition, some lavas have been affected by crustal contamination. This effect is most prominent in evolved lavas older than 35 Ma, which assimi-lated 30 ^ 40 % of crustal material. In general, the periodicity of volcanism in conjunction with temporal changes in lava composition and melting regime suggest that the Syrian volcanism was triggered by a pulsing mantle plume located underneath northwestern Arabia.

40|$|The Myggbukta {{caldera complex}} and {{a swarm of}} basic dykes {{constitute}} the latest Tertiary magmatism in the Hold with Hope region, East Greenland. The Sr and Nd isotope ratios of these rocks show coherent variations which extend to high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and low 143 Nd/ 144 Nd values and require a contribution from continental lithosphere. Broad correlations with major element differentiation indices suggest that the continental component was incorporated during magmatic differentiation thereby favouring a crustal contamination process. Trace element concentrations are strongly correlated with isotopic compositions but display ranges for many incompatible elements which extend beyond likely crustal contaminant compositions. This is readily modelled by AFC processes in which the dominant cause of trace element enrichment is the concentration effect of fractional crystallisation rather than {{the composition of the}} contaminant. The simplest such models still require unrealistically high degrees of fractional crystallisation to explain the ten-fold enrichment of some trace elements. This can be overcome if the primary magmas entering the crust already had highly <b>variable</b> <b>trace</b> element compositions. Such variability is readily achieved if melts from different parts of the melting column escape without thorough homogenization. An AFC model which incorporates variability in parental magma composition is then able to simulate the range of compositions observed at Hold with Hope.

Trace element normalized patterns of Ms-bearing amphibolites are enriched in light rare earth elements (LREE) and large-ion lithophile elements (LILE) and evidence <b>variable</b> <b>trace</b> element transfer from the Proto-Caribbean subducting slab to the mantle wedge. Ms-bearing trondhjemites show LREE enrichment and HREE depletion and have geochemical features similar to adakites, including SiO 2 > 56 wt. %, high Na 2 O contents (5. 5 - 9. 0 wt. %) and high Sr/Y (16 - 644). We consider that the trondhjemites represent primary and natural melts formed by deep partial melting of the subducting slab which did not significantly react with the mantle wedge before intrusion in the subduction channel. The Ms-bearing trondhjemites show different geochemical and petrological signatures compared with the Ms-free tonalites-trondhjemites from Sierra del Convent, that are interpreted as primary slab melts. These differences {{support the idea that}} partial melting processes in the Sierra del Convento subduction channel were triggered by the infiltration of fluids derived from three distinct subducted sources: sediments, altered mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB), and serpentinites.

Clinopyroxenes from the xenoliths display <b>variable</b> <b>trace</b> element enrichment/depletion patterns compared with the pattern of average primitive mantle. Enrichment in LREE and Sr coupled with depletion of Nb, Ti and Zr in xenoliths from both areas are attributed to asthenospheric metasomatic fluids affecting the lithospheric mantle. Metasomatism is apparent in the sieve textures and glassy drops in clinopyroxenes, by glassy patches with associated primary carbonates in Paraguayan xenoliths. Trace element geochemistry and thermobarometric data indicate lack of interaction between xenoliths and host lavas, due to their rapid ascent. Sr and Nd isotope signatures of the Andean and Paraguayan xenoliths and host volcanic rocks plot mainly into the field of depleted mantle and show some compositional overlap. The Andean samples indicate a generally slightly more depleted mantle lithosphere.

40|$|In {{the near}} future a {{decision}} will be made {{as to whether or}} not Yucca Mountain, 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada is a suitable site for a permanent, underground, high level nuclear waste repository. A major factor in determining the suitability of Yucca Mountain as a repository is the potential for the site to be flooded by water during the regulatory lifetime. The current study was undertaken to examine the past fluid history at the site, to gain a better understanding of the possibility of flooding in the near geologic future. To estimate the past fluid flux into the repository horizon, research has focused on secondary minerals that precipitated in open space in lithophysal cavities, fractures, and breccias in the host Miocene tuffs. U. S. Geological Survey researchers concluded that secondary minerals formed from descending surficial meteoric fluids in a vadose environment. State of Nevada scientists observed 2 -phase fluid inclusions with homogenization temperatures of 35 to 85 °C in secondary minerals and concluded that these minerals formed in the phreatic environment from upwelling hydrothermal fluids. They further concluded that upwelling hydrothermal fluids repeatedly invaded the site, have invaded the site in the recent geologic past, and could do so again making Yucca Mountain an unsafe site for high level nuclear waste storage. These studies did not constrain the timing of incursion of the fluids with elevated temperatures or the extent of this fluid flux across the site. This report provides the geologic context for subsequent fluid inclusion and geochronological studies (Wilson et al., 2002) that identified the temperature and extent of the fluid incursion and placed absolute temporal constraints on the fluid history at Yucca Mountain. Here we describe a detailed paragenetic study that determined the depositional history of secondary minerals at Yucca Mountain. One hundred and fifty-five samples of secondary minerals were collected from lithophysal cavities, fractures, and breccias at Yucca Mountain. Extensive petrography, paragenetic studies, and microprobe mapping indicate that early secondary minerals were heterogeneously distributed across the site and consist of variable amounts of calcite, opal, chalcedony, fluorite, and quartz.

40|$|To better {{assess the}} {{potential}} role of pyroxenites in basalt generation at mid-ocean ridges, we performed partial melting experiments on two natural websterites and one clinopyroxenite representative of worldwide pyroxenites. The experiments were conducted at 1 and 1. 5 GPa in a piston-cylinder apparatus; the microdike technique {{was used to}} separate the liquid from the solid phases and to obtain reliable glass analyses even at low degrees of melting. Contrasted melting behaviors were observed depending on the phase proportions at the solidus, especially the abundance of orthopyroxene. (1) If orthopyroxene is abundant, the main melting reaction {{is similar to the}} melting reaction in peridotites (clinopyroxene + orthopyroxene +/- spinel = liquid + olivine), and the liquids are similar to peridotite-derived melts for most major elements. (2) In the absence of orthopyroxene, the main melting reaction is clinopyroxene + spinel = liquid + olivine, yielding liquids that are strongly depleted in SiO 2 in comparison to peridotite-derived melts. This low-SiO 2 content can be associated with a high FeO content, a combination usually ascribed to a high average pressure of melting (of a peridotitic source). Because of their higher melt productivities and lower solidus temperatures, 5 wt. % of pyroxenites in a heterogeneous mantle may contribute up to 40 wt. % of the total melt production. (1) In some cases, pyroxenite-derived melts differ strongly from peridotite partial melts, leading to a distinct pyroxenite signature in the average melt (lower alkali and TiO 2 contents, lower SiO 2, higher FeO and/or lower Mg#). The classical criteria used to select primitive mantle-derived magmas (melt inclusions hosted into high Mg# olivine or MORB glasses with Mg# >= 67) or to track down enriched mantle sources (MORB glasses with high incompatible element contents) must be considered with caution, otherwise melts carrying a pyroxenite signature may be eliminated. (2) In general, however, the major-element signature of pyroxenites should be hardly detectable in the average melt because of the similarity of most pyroxenite-derived melts with peridotite partial melts. This similarity may explain why MORB have relatively uniform major-element compositions, but may have <b>variable</b> <b>trace</b> element and/or isotopic compositions...|$|E
