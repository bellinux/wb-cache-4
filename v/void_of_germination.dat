Also <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> seeds and seedling recruitment have been adapting to climate change. During the last 150 years the current global warming is changing the germinalibity of seeds, the timing <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> the rate <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> and the seedling recruitment. This bachelor thesis summarizes results of studies on how climate change effects the <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> plants and the seedling recruitment. This work also presents methods used for studying these questions. Studies often focus on germinalibity, the rate <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> and the timing <b>of</b> <b>germination.</b> Some <b>of</b> the species are profiting from these changes and we can observe faster germination and better germinalibity.

In order to evaluate the effects of cold stress in the period <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> and seedling and recovery percent of rice cultivars, two independent tests were performed in 2006 - 2007 in Rice Research Institution at Amol city. An experiment was conducted by split split plots within a randomized block design (CRD) with 54 caring composition, 3 replications and 6 cultivars were used. In this study, main plots were temperature, sub plots were length of stress and sub sub plots were cultivars. The levels of temperature including 10 oc (intense stress), 14 0 C (critical temperature) and 32 0 C (improving temperature, control) and levels of stress time 12, 24, 48 hours and cultivars of local Tarom, Domsiya, Hybrid, Nemat, Gerde, Unda were selected two by two based on quality of product and then performed in unit area and finally resistance against cold respectively. On the period <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> with decreasing temperature from 32 0 C to 14 0 C and from 14 0 C to 10 0 C, total decrease studied indices with exception of percentage of damage to seed are meaningful and similar reaction in recovery section <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> is obvious. In the period of seedling, we can see a meaningful decrease in significant level 1 % about of decreasing temperature of total stress, percentage of damage to seedling, vigour of seedling. By increasing temperature in the period <b>of</b> stress <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> there is a meaningful increase level 1 % of total studied features with the exception of damage of seed. In the period <b>of</b> recovery <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> there is a meaningful increase in significant level 1 % of total studied features with the exception of damage to seed. In the period <b>of</b> stress <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> there is a meaningful decrease at total features with the exception of sensitive to stress, percentage of damage to seedling and vigour of seedling and aceous recovery are similar in the period of seedling. By decreasing time of stress in the period <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> there is a meaningful decrease by percent of damage total features with exception <b>of</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> percentage <b>of</b> <b>germination.</b> In the period <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> recovery, there is a meaningful increase in length if radicle, length of stem, percentage <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> and rate <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> and other features have meaningful decrease. In the period of seedling recovery, by decreasing time of stress, length of shoot, length of radicle, weight of wet, dry root and other features have meaningful increase. The effects of cultivar in total tests and stages, was significant level 1 %. The results show that, feature <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> and length <b>of</b> stem and percentage of damage to seed in different cultivars are various. In the period of recovery, percentage <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> and percentage <b>of</b> damage to seeds, had correct criteria for selecting cultivars sensitive to cold stress.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic, spore-forming {{bacterium}} that is {{the most}} common cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea in developed countries. Control of C. difficile is challenging because the spores are resistant to killing by alcohol-based hand hygiene products, antimicrobial soaps, and most disinfectants. Although initiation <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> has been shown to increase susceptibility of spores of other bacterial species to radiation and heat, it was not known if triggering <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> could be a useful strategy to increase susceptibility of C. difficile spores to radiation or other stressors. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we demonstrated that exposure of dormant C. difficile spores to a germination solution containing amino acids, minerals, and taurocholic acid resulted in initiation <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> in room air. <b>Germination</b> <b>of</b> spores in room air resulted in significantly enhanced killing by ultraviolet-C (UV-C) radiation and heat. On surfaces in hospital rooms, application <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> solution resulted in enhanced eradication of spores by UV-C administered by an automated room decontamination device. Initiation <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> under anaerobic, but not aerobic, conditions resulted in increased susceptibility to killing by ethanol, suggesting that exposure to oxygen might prevent spores from progressing fully to outgrowth. Stimulation <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> also resulted in reduced survival of spores on surfaces in room air, possibly due to increased susceptibility to stressors such as oxygen and desiccation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data demonstrate that stimulation <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> could represent a novel method to enhance killing of spores by UV-C, and suggest the possible application of this strategy as a means to enhance killing by other agents...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} chemical and physical factors on the rate and extent <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> Clostridium difficile spores. METHODS AND RESULTS: <b>Germination</b> <b>of</b> C. difficile spores following exposure to chemical and physical germinants was measured by loss of either heat or ethanol resistance. Sodium taurocholate and chenodeoxycholate initiated germination together with thioglycollate medium at concentrations of 0. 1 - 100 mmol l(- 1) and 10 - 100 mmol l(- 1) respectively. Glycine (0. 2 % w/v) was a co-factor required for germination with sodium taurocholate. There {{was no significant difference}} in the rate <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> C. difficile spores in aerobic and anaerobic conditions (P > 0. 05) however, the initial rate <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> was significantly increased at 37 degrees C compared to 20 degrees C (P < 0. 05). The optimum pH range for germination was 6. 5 - 7. 5, with a decreased rate and extent <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> occurring at pH 5. 5 and 8. 5. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that sodium taurocholate and chenodeoxycholate initiate <b>germination</b> <b>of</b> C. difficile spores and is concentration dependant.

During this period of growth, the AChE protein accounts for 4 – 10 % of the total proteins in the root tissue...|$|R
40|$|<b>Germination</b> and {{outgrowth}} <b>of</b> ascospores of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 4579 {{require both}} methionine and adenine, whereas leucine is only required for outgrowth. The methionine requirement may be satisfied by S-adenosylmethionine, but this sulfonium compound will not substitute for adenine. Between 30 and 70 min of protein synthesis is initially {{required for the}} completion <b>of</b> <b>germination</b> in strain 4579. The inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase by trifluoromethionine prevents both germination and protein synthesis. During the initial stages <b>of</b> <b>germination,</b> the S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, and transfer ribonucleic acid methyltransferases increased significantly, indicating that polyamines and/or the methylation of transfer ribonucleic acid are required for the initiation <b>of</b> <b>germination...</b>|$|R
