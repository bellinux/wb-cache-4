40|$|Introduction: Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) is the modality {{of the first}} choice for evaluation of vertebral compression/collapse. Many MRI qualitative features help to differentiate benign from malignant collapse. We conducted this study {{to look for a}} quantitative difference in chemical shift values in benign and malignant collapse using dual-echo gradient echo in-phase/out-phase imaging. Materials and Methods: MRI examinations of a total of 38 patients were retrospectively included in the study who had vertebral compression/collapse with marrow edema in which final diagnosis was available at the time of imaging/follow-up. Signal intensity value in the region of abnormal marrow signal and adjacent normal vertebra was measured on in phase/out phase images. Signal intensity ratio (SIR) was measured by dividing signal intensity value on opposite phase images to that on in phase images. SIR was compared in normal vertebrae and benign and malignant <b>vertebral</b> <b>collapse.</b> Results: There were 21 males and 17 females with mean age of 52. 4 years (range 28 – 76 years). Out of total 38 patients, 18 were of benign <b>vertebral</b> <b>collapse</b> and 20 of malignant <b>vertebral</b> <b>collapse.</b> SIR in normal vertebrae was 0. 30 ± 0. 14, 0. 67 ± 0. 18 in benign <b>vertebral</b> <b>collapse,</b> and 1. 20 ± 0. 27 in malignant <b>vertebral</b> <b>collapse</b> with significant difference in SIR of normal vertebrae versus benign collapse (P < 0. 01) and in benign collapse versus malignant collapse (P < 0. 01). Assuming a cutoff of < 0. 95 for benign collapse and ≥ 0. 95 for malignant collapse, chemical shift imaging had a sensitivity of 90 % and specificity of 94. 4 %.

40|$|Study Design: A {{retrospective}} study. Purpose: To categorize the MR {{appearance of}} ischemic <b>vertebral</b> <b>collapse</b> and to correlate surgical and histologic findings. Overview of Literature: X-ray and MRI findings of delayed posttraumatic <b>vertebral</b> <b>collapse</b> shows several patterns. Histopathologic signs of osteonecrosis were present only in minor portion of cases sampled for biopsy of delayed post-traumatic <b>vertebral</b> <b>collapse</b> in the literature. Methods: Twenty-one patients (22 vertebral bodies), with surgically and histopathologically proven ischemic <b>vertebral</b> <b>collapse</b> were included. The patients were examined with a 1. 5 T MR imager. Spin echo T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images were obtained in axial and sagittal planes. Two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists, who reached consensus, evaluated the MR images. Then, MR-pathology correlations were made. Results: Four different MR patterns were identified. Fluid patterns, {{were seen in}} 14 % (3 / 22) of the affected vertebral bodies, and were characterized by hypo-intense signals on T 1 -weighted images, and hyper-intense signals, similar to water, on T 2 -weighted images. Extensive bone necrosis was predominant. Compression pattern, the most common pattern, found in 41 % (9 / 22 vertebral bodies), was characterized by a marked decrease of anterior column height. Bone necrosis, granulation tissue, marrow fibrosis, and reactive new bone formation were found in relatively equal proportion. Granulation pattern, seen in 27 % (6 / 22 vertebral bodies), was characterized by hypo-intense signals on T 1 -weighted images, and intermediate signals on T 2 -weighted images. Extensive granulation tissue was predominant. Mixed patterns were present in 18 % (4 / 22), of the vertebral bodies.

40|$|Previous {{reports have}} {{emphasized}} the importance of neural decompression through either an anterior or posterior approach when reconstruction surgery is performed for neurological deficits following <b>vertebral</b> <b>collapse</b> in the osteoporotic thoracolumbar spine. However, the contribution of these decompression procedures to neurological recovery has not been fully established. In the present study, we investigated 14 consecutive patients who had incomplete neurological deficits following <b>vertebral</b> <b>collapse</b> in the osteoporotic thoracolumbar spine and underwent posterior instrumented fusion without neural decompression. They were radiographically and neurologically assessed during an average follow-up period of 25  months. The mean local kyphosis angle was 14. 6 ° at flexion and 4. 1 ° at extension preoperatively, indicating marked instability at the collapsed vertebrae. The mean spinal canal occupation by bone fragments was 21 %. After surgery, solid bony fusion was obtained in all patients. The mean local kyphosis angle became 5. 8 ° immediately after surgery and 9. 9 ° at the final follow-up. There was no implant dislodgement, and no additional surgery was required. In all patients, back pain was relieved, and neurological improvement was obtained by at least one modified Frankel grade. The present series demonstrate that the posterior instrumented fusion without neural decompression for incomplete neurological deficits following <b>vertebral</b> <b>collapse</b> in the osteoporotic thoracolumbar spine can provide neurological improvement and relief of back pain without major complications.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundVertebral {{collapse}} is {{a common}} problem due to benign bone marrow lesions, trauma or malignant process. The diagnosis is often correctly predicted from characteristic imaging appearance. Some vertebral collapses have atypical imaging appearance that may cause diagnostic confusion. AimTo evaluate {{the value of the}} ADC obtained in DW-MR sequences for the differentiation between benign and malignant bone marrow lesions. PatientsSixty patients were included in this study, referred from Neurosurgery and Radiotherapy Departments and proved to have vertebral compression based on conventional MR imaging. ResultsThe ADC value resulted in statistically significant characterization between (osteoporotic and post-traumatic collapse) and (malignant <b>vertebral</b> <b>collapse)</b> (P 0. 05). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPD of DWI and ADC values in differentiating benign from malignant <b>vertebral</b> <b>collapse</b> were 100 %, 83. 3 %, 60 % and 100 % respectively.

40|$|Although {{spontaneous}} remission occurs {{in patients with}} idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis (IJO), permanent bone deformities may occur. The effects of long-term pamidronate treatment on clinical findings, bone mineral status, and fracture rate were evaluated. Nine patients (age 9. 8 ± 1. 1 years, 7 males) with IJO were randomized to intravenous pamidronate (0. 8 ± 0. 1 mg/kg per day for 3 days; cycles per year 2. 0 ± 0. 1; duration 7. 3 ± 1. 1 years; n = 5) or no treatment (n = 4). Fracture rate, phalangeal quantitative ultrasound, and lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry at entry and during follow-up (range 6. 3 - 9. 4 years) were assessed. Bone pain improved in treated patients. Difficulty walking continued for 3 - 5 years in untreated patients, and <b>vertebral</b> <b>collapses</b> occurred in three of them. During follow-up, phalangeal amplitude-dependent speed of sound (AD-SoS), bone transmission time (BTT), and lumbar BMDarea and BMDvolume progressively increased in treated patients (P < 0. 05 -P < 0. 0001). In untreated patients AD-SoS and BTT decreased during the first 2 - 4 years of follow-up (P < 0. 05 -P < 0. 01); lumbar BMDarea increased after 6 years (P < 0. 001) whereas BTT and lumbar BMDvolume increased after 7 years of follow-up (P < 0. 05 and P < 0. 001, respectively).

30|$|Vertebral haemangiomas are {{the most}} common benign {{vertebral}} neoplasm, having been found in 11  % of spines at autopsy [1]. They are usually primarily within the vertebral body, less commonly involving the pedicles or posterior elements. They are most frequently located in the lower thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. Multiple haemangiomas occur in roughly one-third of cases. Haemangiomas are more common in women, with peak occurrence in the fourth to sixth decades of life. Although typically small and slow-growing, an aggressive radiologic growth pattern may be evident, with features that include bone expansion, extension into posterior elements, extraosseous extension, disturbance of local blood flow and compression fractures. Aggressive haemangiomas can result in local or radicular pain secondary to <b>vertebral</b> body <b>collapse</b> or encroachment into the spinal canal and cord compression from extradural haemorrhage or soft-tissue extension [2]. Paradoxically, symptomatic haemangiomas may show no radiologic signs of aggression, and aggressive haemangiomas may be asymptomatic [3].
