40|$|Abstract—Hot-electron {{injection}} {{is widely}} used for accurate programming of on-chip floating-gate voltage and current references. The conventional programming approach involves adapting the duration and magnitude of the injectionpulsesbasedonapredictive model which is estimated by using measured data. However, varying the pulse-widths or amplitudes introduces nonlinearity in the injection process which complicates the modeling, calibration and programming procedure. In this paper, we propose a linear hot-electron injection technique which significantly simplifies the programming procedure, and can achieve programming accuracy greater than 13 -b which {{is limited by the}} thermal noise from the injection process. The procedure employs an active feedback circuit which ensures that all the nonlinear factors affecting the hot-electron injection process are held constant, thus achieving a stable and controllable injection rate. Measured results using an array of floating-gate voltage reference prototyped in a 0. 5 - mstandard CMOS process demonstrate that the injection rates can be controlled from 0. 1 to 4. 1 V for the programmable <b>voltage</b> <b>range.</b> <b>Using</b> 50 -ms injection pulses, we show that the average injection rate can be adapted from 6. 9 to 250 V.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{penetration of}} distributed generation (DG) sources in low-voltage grid feeders causes problems concerning voltage regulation. The penetration of DG {{sources such as}} photovoltaics (PVs) in the distribution system can significantly impact the power flow and voltage conditions on the customer side.

This study aimed to {{examine the effect of}} 50 % inhaled Xenon on background amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) activity in sedated healthy newborn pigs. Methods Five healthy newborn pigs, receiving intravenous fentanyl sedation, were ventilated for 24 h with 50 %Xenon, 30 %O 2 and 20 %N 2 at normothermia. The upper and lower voltage-range of the aEEG was continuously monitored together with cardiovascular parameters throughout a 1 h baseline period with fentanyl sedation only, followed by 24 h of Xenon administration. Results The median (IQR) upper and lower aEEG voltage during 1 h baseline was 48. 0 μV (46. 0 – 50. 0) and 25. 0 μV (23. 0 – 26. 0), respectively. The median (IQR) aEEG upper and lower <b>voltage</b> <b>ranges</b> were significantly depressed to 21. 5 μV (20. 0 – 26. 5) and 12. 0 μV (12. 0 – 16. 5) from 10 min after the onset of 50 % Xenon administration (p = 0. 002).

As for other brain structures implicated in learning, the principal neurons of the anterior cortical nucleus (ACo) exhibit intrinsic subthreshold membrane potential oscillations in the h-frequency range. Here we show that nearly 50 % of ACo layer II neurons also display electrical resonance, consisting of selective responsiveness to stimuli of a preferential frequency (2 – 6 Hz). Their impedance profile resembles an electrical band-pass filter with a peak at the preferred frequency, {{in contrast to the}} low-pass filter properties of other neurons.

40|$|Memory {{architectures}} {{are subject}} to the same scaling trend towards higher performance, low power consumption and lower cost as well as all other electronic circuits. Moore’s law seems like a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, ultimate physical limitations prevent the continued miniaturisation of today’s memory devices. Redoxbased resistive switching memories (ReRAM) are according to the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) the most likely replacement for today’s systems. In experiments with Ag/GeSx-based electrochemical metallisation memory cells (ECM) first promising properties with regard to possible applications in high-density memories and logic architectures were demonstrated. In this thesis about germanium sulphide-based ECM memory cells a wide range of topics is covered from the basic thin film preparation to studies of the fundamental material properties and the switching kinetics up to practical logic and memory applications. A dedicated cluster tool for sophisticated sample preparation was developed and put into operation. In this tool germanium sulphide GeSx and silver Ag were deposited in situ by RF sputter deposition as a solid electrolyte and as an active electrode material, respectively. The deposition of GeSx by sputter deposition provides the ability to adjust the stoichiometry through the process pressure. In the context of materials investigations the existence of an electromotive force (EMF) was proven in addition to the preferred charge transfer from the electrode material Ag towards the germanium component of the electrolyte. It must be assumed that conducting filaments in this type of memory cell consist of a silver-rich Ag-GeSx phase. The electrical characterisation brought new findings in the field of SET and RESET switching kinetics, that could be classified in comparison with an existing simulation model. A clear non-linear behaviour of the SET-time at small SETvoltages could be attributed to a nucleation limited process. For the first time also the RESET kinetics was studied in detail and a limitation by the electron transfer or through the ion migration was identified, depending on the <b>voltage</b> <b>range</b> <b>used.</b> The possibility of a polarity-independent RESET in ECM memory cells was also demonstrated. Relevant with respect to future applications were experiments on the physical origin and the ability to suppress the continuous dissolution of the Ag electrode into the electrolyte. When interconnecting two Ag-GeSx memory cells as a Complementary Resistive Switch (CRS) ultra fast response times could be observed in the range of 20 ns. It was also possible to demonstrate alternative readout methods with this device.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Voltage {{calibration}} {{methods used}} with X-ray tubes are either electrical procedures requiring direct electrical connection or ionization techniques which require no electrical {{connection to the}} generating system. One major restriction {{on the use of}} electrical methods for measuring the voltage applied to X-ray tubes is that special electrical adaptors are required to bring the conductors out of the grounded tube housing or high-voltage cables. X-ray installations are not normally equipped with these special adaptors and in most cases the use of the X-ray tube would be restricted by the presence of the external high-voltage adaptor. High voltage measuring methods which do not require electrical connection to the X-ray generating system employ direct or indirect ionization techniques to measure the applied voltage. The K-edge calibration method, used in this project, is a direct ionization method based upon the detection of the K-series fluorescent radiation from various secondary radiators. The two main advantages of this method are accuracy and the elimination of electrical connections to the X-ray generating system. Published information on this method lacked data in the region extending from 40 kV to 67 kV. The lack of calibration data in this <b>voltage</b> <b>range</b> was due to the unavailability of secondary radiator elements of suitable purity. Certain rare earth elements were used to provide calibration measurements within this <b>voltage</b> <b>range.</b> The oxides of cerium, samarium, gadolinium, holmium and ytterbium were used and calibration data was obtained at 40. 43 kV, 46. 85 kV, 50. 23 kV, 55. 61 kV, and 61. 31 kV, respectively. The K-edge calibrations for tin (29. 2 kV) and tantalum (67. 5 kV) were used to provide an experimental base line. These data, combined with previous reference values, permit the use of the K-edge ionization calibration method throughout the entire <b>voltage</b> <b>range</b> commonly <b>used</b> in diagnostic X-ray procedures. Reproducible results can be obtained using this kilovoltage calibration method if certain variables are rigidly controlled. The geometrical arrangement of all the equipment must remain constant throughout the entire period of time during which the measurements are taken at the K-edge. Changes in geometry alter the amount of scattered radiation and the effective thickness of the secondary radiator. The oxide secondary radiator must not be subjected to mechanical shock or vibration after final positioning in the beam and its moisture content must be held constant throughout the entire measurement period. Changes in any of these parameters result in errors in the ionization chamber readings. The accuracy and wide <b>voltage</b> <b>range</b> make the K-edge ionization method of X-ray tube kilovoltage measurement a reliable procedure for use in X-ray physics. Most other kilovoltage measuring methods encounter problems at high tube currents and short exposure times. The ionization method is restricted only by the intensity limits of the ionization chambers and if these are selected properly then this method may be used at tube currents and exposure times where most other methods fail...|$|R
