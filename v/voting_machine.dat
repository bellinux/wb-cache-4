25|$|Since the 2010 elections, {{the voters}} have to shade the oval that was {{indicated}} before the candidate's name, and a <b>voting</b> <b>machine</b> manufactured by Smartmatic automatically counts each ballot {{as it is}} fed into it. The results are then printed as the election return and sent electronically to the city or municipal Board of Canvassers.|$|E
25|$|At {{the behest}} of Rep. Tom Feeney, in September 2000, {{he was asked to}} write a program for a {{touchscreen}} <b>voting</b> <b>machine</b> that would make it possible to change the results of an election undetectably. Curtis assumed initially that this effort was aimed at detecting Democratic fraud, but later learned that it was intended to benefit the Republican Party.|$|E
25|$|As in the 2004 {{election}}, {{this election}} was also conducted completely using electronic <b>voting</b> <b>machines</b> (EVMs), with 1,368,430 <b>voting</b> <b>machines</b> deployed across the country.|$|R
50|$|Responses {{to these}} {{requirements}} varied by state, but a widespread effect {{has been the}} purchasing of electronic <b>voting</b> <b>machines,</b> including DRE <b>voting</b> <b>machines.</b> There are criticisms of the reliability and security of these machines.|$|R

25|$|A {{recipient}} of two Purple Hearts while an infantry squad {{leader in the}} Vietnam War, Hagel returned home to start careers in business and politics. He co-founded Vanguard Cellular, {{the primary source of}} his personal wealth, and {{served as president of the}} McCarthy Group, an investment banking firm, and CEO of American Information Systems Inc., a computerized <b>voting</b> <b>machine</b> manufacturer. A member of the Republican Party, Hagel was first elected to the United States Senate in 1996. He was reelected in 2002, but did not run in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Although he was {{pressured}} {{by some to}} run for Governor of Virginia, where he had lived for 20 years, in 1992 Hagel moved back to Nebraska {{to become president of}} the McCarthy Group, LLC, an investment banking firm. He also served as a Chairman and was CEO of American Information Systems Inc. (AIS), later known as Election Systems & Software, a computerized <b>voting</b> <b>machine</b> manufacturer jointly owned by McCarthy Group, LLC and the Omaha World-Herald company. On March 15, 1995, Hagel resigned from the board of AIS as he intended to run for office. Michael McCarthy, the parent company's founder, was Hagel's campaign treasurer. Until at least 2003, he retained between $1 million and $5 million in stock in Election Systems & Software's parent company, the McCarthy Group.|$|E
25|$|Secretary Land led {{the charge}} to {{consolidate}} Michigan’s elections, which saved money, reduced confusion, and helped eliminate ‘stealth elections’. Staying ahead of the work required by the Help America Vote Act, Land also selected a single style <b>voting</b> <b>machine</b> to be implemented statewide with funding from the federal government. In 2005, Land's office announced an effort to use the Help America Vote Act to reduce potential voter fraud by removing names of voters who had died, moved out of Michigan, or changed their names. A New York Times investigation found that 33,000 people {{were removed from the}} rolls, while Land's office said 11,000 voters were removed. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took Michigan to court over the removal of voter names. The New York Times pointed out that “the problems were not unique to Michigan, and that states with Republican and Democratic election officials had struggled to interpret new federal laws, such as the Help America Vote Act.” In October 2008, a federal judge ruled that the national Voting Rights Act had been violated and six states, including Michigan, were ordered to stop removing names from voter rolls. A spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s office told the Detroit Free Press that, “If you're eligible to vote, {{you will be able to}} cast a vote on Election Day". Furthermore, Land spearheaded several outreach initiatives that increased voter participation, including touring all university campuses to offer registration opportunities, which caused unprecedented voter turnout rates in 2004, 2006, and 2008.|$|E

[...] Additionally, <b>voting</b> <b>machine</b> redistribution has been closely studied with the hope of alleviating long waits in problem areas. [...] Redistribution is based on past turnout, new registrations, any recent purges under the National Voter Registration Act, and the number of ballot issues in the district.

500|$|Brunner {{has spoken}} out against {{election}} officials taking voting machines {{home with them}} in the days before an election. [...] Such actions could allow hacking even though it makes transport and delivery to the eventual polling place simpler. [...] Some elections officials say they feel the system is better if elections officials keep an eye on machines the days before the elections. [...] Brunner says poll workers have sometimes cast ballots on machines in their homes. [...] She issued the following directive on the matter: [...] "We want Ohio’s voters {{and the rest of the}} nation to see that we have prepared a transparent process of transporting voting equipment, ballots and supplies. That begins with security practices at boards of elections and polling places, documented chain of custody, and now procedures to make secure <b>voting</b> <b>machine</b> delivery."
