40|$|OBJECTIVE: Mutations in genes {{encoding}} succinate dehydrogenase and its anchoring subunits (SDH genes) are at {{the origin}} of hereditary head and neck paraganglioma (PGL) and a subset of apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma. METHODS: We describe a family including three patients harbouring bilateral head and neck PGL diagnosed before 25 years of age. Multiple hypervascular hepatic lesions were subsequently discovered in two of them. In both, liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of PGL. In addition, in one patient, MRI disclosed multiple target-like lesions of the spine, highly suggestive of metastatic PGL. Family history was compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance with possible maternal imprinting. RESULTS: Combined single-strand conformation polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis followed by sequencing did not show any mutation of the coding parts of SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, RET or <b>VHL</b> <b>genes.</b> Screening of copy number alterations and loss of heterozygosity in the three affected family members showed no deletion or amplification of the SDH, RET and <b>VHL</b> <b>genes.</b> Furthermore, succinate dehydrogenase activity measured in a liver PGL sample was not significantly decreased in the affected patient as compared with controls, underscoring {{the exclusion of the}} SDH genes. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first reported family of hereditary head and neck PGL with metastatic dissemination in the liver and the spine. A large body of evidence supports the absence of mutations in SDH, RET and <b>VHL</b> <b>genes,</b> which suggests the existence of a yet unknown gene at the origin of this particular form of familial PGL...|$|R

We show in a rigorous experimental assessment that our approach is capable of detecting variants with frequencies as low as 1 / 10, 000 alleles. In selected genomic loci of the TP 53 and <b>VHL</b> <b>genes</b> isolated from matched tumour and normal samples of four renal cell carcinoma patients, we detect 24 variants at allele frequencies ranging from 0. 0002 to 0. 34.

50|$|In {{the normal}} cell with active VHL protein, HIF alpha is {{regulated}} by hydroxylation {{in the presence}} of oxygen. When iron, 2-oxoglutarate and oxygen are present, HIF is inactivated by HIF hydroxylases. Hydroxylation of HIF creates a binding site for pVHL (the protein transcript of the <b>VHL</b> <b>gene).</b> pVHL directs the polyubiquitylation of HIF1A, ensuring that this protein will be degraded by the proteasome. In hypoxic conditions, HIF1A subunits accumulate and bind to HIFB. This heterodimer of HIF is a transcription factor that activates genes that encode for proteins such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and erythropoietin, proteins that are both involved in angiogenesis. Cells with abnormal pVHL are unable to disrupt the formation of these dimers, and therefore behave like they are hypoxic even in oxygenated environments.|$|E
50|$|The VHL protein (pVHL) is {{involved}} in the regulation of a protein known as hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α). This is a subunit of a heterodimeric transcription factor that at normal cellular oxygen levels is highly regulated. In normal physiological conditions, pVHL recognizes and binds to HIF1α only when oxygen is present due to the post translational hydroxylation of 2 proline residues within the HIF1α protein. pVHL is an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates HIF1α and causes its degradation by the proteasome. In low oxygen conditions or in cases of VHL disease where the <b>VHL</b> <b>gene</b> is mutated, pVHL does not bind to HIF1α. This allows the subunit to dimerise with HIF1β and activate the transcription of a number of genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor B, erythropoietin and genes involved in glucose uptake and metabolism.

50|$|The first {{discovery}} of methylation in a CpG island of a {{tumor suppressor gene}} in humans {{was that of the}} Retinoblastoma (Rb) gene in 1989. This was just a few years after the first oncogene mutation was discovered in a human primary tumor. The {{discovery of}} the methylation-associated inactivation of the Von Hippel-Lindau (<b>VHL)</b> <b>gene</b> revived the idea of the hypermethylation of the CpG island promoter being a mechanism to inactivate genes in cancer. Cancer epigenetic silencing in its current state was born in the labs of Baylin and Jones, where it was proven that CpG island hypermethylation was a common inactivation mechanism of the tumor suppressor gene p16INK4a. The introduction of methylation-specific PCR and sodium bisulfite modification added tools to the belt of cancer epigenetics research, and the list of candidate genes with aberrant methylation of their CpG islands has been growing since. Initially, the presence of alterations in the profile of DNA methylation in cancer was seen as a global hypomethylation of the genome that would lead to massive overexpression of oncogenes with a normally hypermethylated CpG island. Lately, this is considered as an incomplete scenario, despite the idea of the genome of the cancer cell undergoing a reduction of its 5-methylcytosine content when compared to its parent normal cell being correct. In normal tissues, the vast majority of CpG islands are completely unmethylated with some exceptions. The association of transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes with hypermethylation is the foundation upon which this subset of cancer epigenetics stands.|$|E

In CCRCC, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis studies have reported genetic differences between paired P and metastatic (M) tumors. We thus sequenced the <b>VHL</b> <b>gene</b> in paired tumor specimens from 10 patients to determine a possible clonal relationship between the P tumor and M lesion(s) in patients with CCRCC. Using paraffin embedded specimens, genomic DNA from microdissected samples (> 80 % tumor) of paired P tumor and M lesions from all 10 patients, as well as in normal tissue from 6 of these cases, was analyzed. The DNA was used for PCR-based amplification of each of the 3 exons of the <b>VHL</b> <b>gene.</b> Sequences derived from amplified samples were compared to the wild-type <b>VHL</b> <b>gene</b> sequence (GeneBank Accession No. AF 010238).

With a median follow-up of 34 months (range, 2 - 127 months), the median time to progression (TTP) and median overall survival (OS) for the entire group of patients were 5. 8 and 26. 7 months, respectively. In patients with and without <b>VHL</b> <b>gene</b> alterations, the median TTP was 5. 5 and 6. 9 months, respectively (p = 0. 15) and the median overall survival time was 22. 0 and 34. 5 months, respectively (p = 0. 98).

To investigate the role of somatic <b>VHL</b> <b>gene</b> mutations in non-famitial RCC, we analysed 99 primary RCC for <b>VHL</b> <b>gene</b> mutations by SSCP and heteroduplex analysis.

Recent studies suggest a "second hit" mechanism resulting in amplification of mutant RET. Somatic <b>VHL</b> <b>gene</b> alterations are implicated in the pathogenesis of MEN 2 pheochromocytomas. We hypothesized that somatic <b>VHL</b> <b>gene</b> alterations are also important in the pathogenesis of MEN 2 -associated MTC. Methods We analyzed 6 MTCs and 1 C-cell hyperplasia (CCH) specimen from 7 patients with MEN 2 A and RET germline {{mutations in}} codons 609, 618, 620, or 634, using microdissection, microsatellite analysis, phosphorimage densitometry, and VHL mutation analysis. Results First, we searched for allelic imbalance between mutant and wild-type RET by using the polymorphic markers D 10 S 677, D 10 S 1239, and RET on thyroid tissue from these patients. Evidence for RET amplification by this technique could be demonstrated in 3 of 6 MTCs. We then performed LOH analysis using D 3 S 1038 and D 3 S 1110 which map to the <b>VHL</b> <b>gene</b> locus at 3 p 25 / 26. <b>VHL</b> <b>gene</b> deletion was present in 3 MTCs. These 3 MTCs also had an allelic imbalance between mutant and wild-type RET. Mutation analysis of the <b>VHL</b> <b>gene</b> showed a somatic frameshift mutation in 1 MTC that also demonstrated LOH at 3 p 25 / 26. In the 2 other MTCs with allelic imbalance of RET and somatic <b>VHL</b> <b>gene</b> deletion, no somatic VHL mutation could be detected. The CCH specimen did neither reveal RET imbalance nor somatic <b>VHL</b> <b>gene</b> alterations.

We further demonstrate that normoxic stabilization of HIF 1 α alone, while capable of mimicking some aspects of VHL loss, is not sufficient to reproduce tumorigenesis, indicating {{that it is not the}} critical oncogenic substrate of VHL...|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} {{responses that}} allow a cell {{to survive and}} adapt to hypoxic stress (low oxygen) are largely conserved. The Hypoxia-Inducible Factor transcription factors (HIFs) are the primary transcription factors mediating responses to hypoxic stress. HIFs are composed of alpha and beta subunits. HIF-α is only stable in hypoxic conditions. The pathway for oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF-α includes a prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD) and the VHL E 3 ligase. The Drosophila homlogs of HIF-α, HIF-β, PHD, and VHL are encoded by the similar, tango, fatiga/Hph, and <b>Vhl</b> <b>genes,</b> respectively. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} similar has roles in Drosophila tracheal development as well as border cell migration. Here I have used the development of germ cells in Drosophila as a tool to study the effects of low oxygen stress, and to explore the potential roles of hypoxic response genes in germ cell development. Utilizing low oxygen culture conditions and loss-of-function mutants I have observed that Drosophila embryogenesis is sensitive to oxygen tension and the zygotic loss of Drosophila HIF- 1 α is not sufficient to induce primordial germ cell defects. Further examination of the complete loss-of-function of other Drosophila HIF components, such as fatiga, could reveal whether it is the HIF hypoxic response pathway or a HIF independent hypoxia induced pathway that mediates Drosophila primordial germ cell development in wild-type embryos exposed to hypoxic conditions...|$|R
