500|$|... "Haunted" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Beyoncé and New York-based musician Boots, who was relatively unknown before {{the release of}} Beyoncé (2013). He was signed to Roc Nation, about six {{months prior to the}} album's release and produced 85% of Beyoncé also having writing credits on four of its tracks. During an interview with Pitchfork Media, Boots revealed that [...] "Haunted" [...] was the first song written by him which Beyoncé heard; it was originally titled [...] "I'm Onto You" [...] at that time. Beyoncé liked the song upon hearing it, leaving Boots confused as he felt the song was only showcasing his sad vocals, with a piano recorded on his iPhone as a <b>voice</b> <b>memo.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... "For me, {{there will}} be days when I write a little poem in a little book, or make a little <b>voice</b> <b>memo</b> in my iPhone. For me, I need to be sitting at an {{instrument}} and be overwhelmed. I've tried {{to look back and}} see if a song just came out of a sunny day. [...] "Oh, today I'm going to write a song." [...] That's never been the case for me. It's always whether I'm just overwhelmed with some emotion. Whether it be I'm happy, I'm sad, I've fallen in love, I've fallen out of love. I'm lonely, I'm scared. Whatever it be that day. If I'm like a volcano and I'm about to explode, I better run to an instrument because it's about to come out. For me, I don't really go back. I probably should. I have a bajillion pieces of songs. But I seem to just write in one sitting. There's very few occasions where I've gone back and worked on songs later. Normally, I sit down, the song comes out and I'm done." ...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{proposes a}} smartphone-camera-based system to assist {{visually}} impaired users in recalling their memories related to important locations, called spots, that they visited. The memories are recorded as <b>voice</b> <b>memos,</b> {{which can be}} played back when the users return to the spots. Spot-to-spot correspondence is determined by image matching based on the scale invariant feature transform. The main contribution of the proposed system is to allow visually impaired users to associate arbitrary <b>voice</b> <b>memos</b> with arbitrary spots. The users do not need any special devices or systems except smartphones and {{do not need to}} remember the spots where the <b>voice</b> <b>memos</b> were recorded. In addition, the proposed system can identify spots in environments that are inaccessible to the global positioning system. The proposed system has been evaluated by two experiments: image matching tests and a user study. The experimental results suggested the effectiveness of the system to help visually impaired individuals, including blind individuals, recall information about regularly-visited spots...|$|R

50|$|Developers had criticized Apple for not {{creating}} a {{software development kit}} (SDK) for software developers to create new iPod games.

Interestingly, running Linux on an iPod retains the music playing functionality of the device, while adding features {{such as the ability}} to create <b>voice</b> <b>memos</b> through the headphones.|$|R
