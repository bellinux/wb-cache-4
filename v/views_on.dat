40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{examines}} a Swedish environmental organization, Naturskyddsföreningen, and its <b>view</b> <b>on</b> nature.

The organizations environmental ethics is also defined {{in order to determine}} what <b>view</b> <b>on</b> nature that is presented and what effect this might have on sustainable development. The results show that the organization holds a <b>view</b> <b>on</b> nature that establishes human beings as superior to nature. Though as superiors, humans have a responsibility to care for the forest when using it for human purposes. The organizations <b>view</b> <b>on</b> nature also corresponds with the hegemonic view that is established around the concept of sustainable development.
