2500|$|Chapman, {{working with}} Tony Rudd and Peter Wright, pioneered the first Formula One use of [...] "ground effect", where a low {{pressure}} was created under the car {{by use of}} <b>venturis,</b> generating suction (downforce) which held it securely to the road whilst cornering. Early designs utilized sliding [...] "skirts" [...] which made contact with the ground to keep the {{area of low pressure}} isolated.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Venturis</b> Belt, {{a planned}} <b>Venturis</b> project {{consisting}} {{a series of}} completely-automated vacation bungalows in Earths orbit, could not be built due to the Human Oversight Accord causing <b>Venturis</b> to lobby heavily in its repeal. Ultimately failing in their efforts, its CEO Sergio Venturi consults with its Corporate Strategic AI JUNO about how to gain support to overturn the decision. The AI concludes that the destruction of an orbital station by [...] "accident" [...] would be their best option, with the Tacoma selected as the target. Consequently, ODIN was ordered by <b>Venturis</b> to stage the accident, intentionally decompressing the oxygen tanks & disabling communications. Rescue attempts were also cancelled by <b>Venturis,</b> ensuring {{the loss of the}} entire crew.|$|E
50|$|<b>Venturis</b> {{are used}} in {{industrial}} applications and in scientific laboratories for measuring the flow rate of liquids.|$|E
50|$|Figure 3 shows liquid {{injected}} at the venturi throat. Since it is sprayed at or {{just before}} the throat, it does not actually coat the throat surface. These throats are susceptible to solids buildup when the throat is dry. They are also susceptible to abrasion by dust particles. These <b>venturis</b> are best used when the inlet stream is cool and moist. These <b>venturis</b> {{are referred to as}} having a non-wetted approach.|$|E
50|$|Ejector <b>venturis</b> {{have a short}} gas-liquid contact {{time because}} the exhaust gas {{velocities}} through the vessel are very high. This short contact time limits the absorption efficiency of the system. Although ejector <b>venturis</b> are not used primarily for gas removal, they can be effective if the gas is very soluble or if a very reactive scrubbing reagent is used. In these instances, removal efficiencies of as high as 95% can be achieved 1977.|$|E
50|$|<b>Venturis</b> {{can be used}} {{to collect}} both {{particulate}} and gaseous pollutants, but they are more effective in removing particles than gaseous pollutants.|$|E
50|$|<b>Venturis</b> {{are also}} used to control fly ash and sulfur dioxide {{emissions}} from industrial and utility boilers.The operating characteristics of venturi scrubbers are listed in Table 1.|$|E
50|$|The house {{which is}} {{actually}} named ‘White Noise’ is inspired from Robert <b>Venturis</b> Term ‘Billboard Façade’. It is actually a most subtle and sophisticated design for a first work, in which post-modernism co-habits seamlessly with minimalism.|$|E
5000|$|To {{maximize}} {{the absorption of}} gases, <b>venturis</b> are designed to operate at {{a different set of}} conditions from those used to collect particles. The gas velocities are lower and the liquid-to-gas ratios are higher for absorption.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} open {{design and the}} fact that they do not require a fan, ejector <b>venturis</b> are capable of {{handling}} a wide range of corrosive and/or sticky particles. However, they are not very effective in removing submicrometer particles. They have an advantage in being able to handle small, medium and large exhaust flows. They can be used singly or in multiple stages of two or more in series, depending on the specific application.Multiple-stage systems have been used where extremely high collection efficiency of particles or gaseous pollutants was necessary. Multiple-stage systems provide increased gas-liquid contact time, thus increasing absorption efficiency.Table 1 lists the operating parameters for ejector <b>venturis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>venturis</b> at {{the station}} do not have bronze throat-liners, unlike those at other Chicago-area pumping stations, {{but this is not}} {{reported}} to be a problem (B. Whalin, USDA-ARS Water Conservation Laboratory, written communication, October 11, 2000).|$|E
5000|$|Particle removal {{efficiency}} increases with increasing pressure drop {{because of increased}} turbulence due to high gas velocity in the throat. <b>Venturis</b> can be operated with pressure drops ranging from 12 to 250 cm (5 to 100 in) of water.|$|E
50|$|The RVF's {{carburettors}} {{were changed}} to a semi-flatslide design and smaller diameter <b>venturis</b> (30 mm against the NC30's 32 mm) but claimed to be better flowing. The velocity stacks were also {{changed to a}}llow a straighter flow into the engine cylinders.|$|E
5000|$|Simple <b>venturis</b> have fixed throat {{areas and}} {{cannot be used}} {{over a wide range}} of gas flow rates. Manufacturers have {{developed}} other modifications to the basic venturi design to maintain scrubber efficiency by changing the throat area for varying inlet gas rates.|$|E
50|$|Ejector <b>venturis</b> are {{effective}} in removing particles larger than 1.0 µm in diameter. These scrubbers are not used on submicrometer-sized particles unless the particles are condensable 1977. Particle collection occurs primarily by impaction as the exhaust gas (from the process) passes through the spray.|$|E
50|$|Gas {{is mixed}} with air in venturi tubes or simply 'venturis'. <b>Venturis</b> can be {{permanently}} attached to the burner or removable. At {{the other end of}} the venturi is the gas valve, which is connected to the control knob on the front of the grill.|$|E
50|$|They are {{the most}} widely used {{scrubbers}} because their open construction enables them to remove most particles without plugging or scalding. <b>Venturis</b> {{can also be used to}} absorb pollutant gases; however, they are not as efficient for this as are packed or plate towers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Venturis</b> are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used scrubber for particle collection and are capable of achieving the highest particle collection efficiency of any wet scrubbing system. As the inlet stream enters the throat, its velocity increases greatly, atomizing and turbulently mixing with any liquid present.|$|E
5000|$|A {{few months}} after {{publishing}} this book, the RIBA Institute in London discussed the new candidates for the RIBA Gold Medal in 2012. An actual question was: [...] "Should the <b>Venturis</b> be given this year's RIBA Gold Medal?" [...] Surprisingly enough, the RIBA-committee did not award the <b>Venturis</b> with their postmodernist view, and instead, gave Herman Hertzberger the prize for his structuralist architecture and theoretical contributions. The times had changed and a shift in emphasis had occurred. The comment of the former RIBA president Jack Pringle was: [...] "The Royal Gold Medal, Britain's most prestigious award, should go to an architect that has taken us forward, not backwards." [...] Today, postmodern architecture can be compared, to some degree with the architectural movement, Traditionalismus, in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Finally, in March 1982, an 80 hp (59 kW) {{version of}} the CVH engine became {{available}} (High Output option H.O.). It had higher (9.0:1) compression, a dual-inlet air cleaner, lower-restriction exhaust, a bifurcated 4 into 2 into 1 exhaust manifold, larger carburetor <b>venturis,</b> and a higher-lift camshaft.|$|E

It had a large circulation, underwent 13 editions until 1551 and exerted a strong effect on Renaissance astronomy.|$|E
5000|$|Venturi {{scrubbers}} {{have been}} designed to collect particles at very high collection efficiencies, sometimes exceeding 99%. The ability of <b>venturis</b> to handle large inlet volumes at high temperatures makes them very attractive to many industries; consequently, they are used to reduce particulate emissions in a number of industrial applications.|$|E
5000|$|The Quadrajet is a [...] "spread bore" [...] carburetor; {{the primary}} <b>venturis</b> are {{much smaller than}} the {{secondary}} <b>venturis.</b> By comparison, a [...] "square bore" [...] carburetor has primary and secondary <b>venturis</b> of similar size. Most Quadrajets were capable of 750 ft3 L/min (cfm) maximum, but some rare Buick and Pontiac models were capable of 800 ft3 L/min for use on high performance engines, and most 1984-1987 pickup trucks were also equipped with the 800-cfm carb. Most Quadrajets use a vacuum operated piston to move the primary metering rods to control the air-fuel ratio, allowing the mixture to be lean under low load conditions and rich during high load conditions. A less-common version uses a linkage driven off the primary throttle shaft to mechanically move the power piston. [...] "E" [...] (electronic control module controlled) series of Quadrajets use a computer controlled mixture control solenoid that responds to electronic signals from the throttle position and oxygen sensors via the computer, ideal for precise fuel metering and allowing additional fuel under load. The solenoid-controlled metering rods allow the fuel mixture to be very close to optimum, then the solenoid is pulse width modulated at about 6 Hz to fine-tune the air fuel ratio under closed loop conditions. The electronic versions have a throttle position sensor that is mounted inside the carburetor body, actuated by the accelerator pump lever.|$|E
5000|$|The player-character Amyitjyoti (Amy) Ferrier is {{assigned}} by <b>Venturis</b> {{to enter the}} abandoned Tacoma station, retrieve AI data from each of its sections and retrieve the physical processing module of ODIN, the stations AI. As Amy explores the station, {{she is able to}} piece together events on the station using its AR system.|$|E
5000|$|The high inlet gas {{velocities}} in a {{venturi scrubber}} {{result in a}} very short contact time between the liquid and gas phases. This short contact time limits gas absorption. However, because <b>venturis</b> have a relatively open design compared to other scrubbers, they are very useful for simultaneous gaseous and particulate pollutant removal, especially when: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Venturis</b> with round throats (Figures 2 and 3) {{can handle}} inlet flows {{as large as}} 88,000 m³/h (40,000 cfm) (Brady and Legatski 1977). At inlet flow rates greater than this, {{achieving}} uniform liquid distribution is difficult, unless additional weirs or baffles are used.To handle large inlet flows, scrubbers designed with long, narrow, rectangular throats (Figure 4) have been used.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>venturis</b> {{normally}} {{operate with}} pressure drops {{in the range}} of 50 to 150 cm (20 to 60 in) of water. At these pressure drops, the gas velocity in the throat section is usually between 30 and 120 m/s (100 to 400 ft/s), or approximately 270 mph at the high end. These high pressure drops result in high operating costs.|$|E
50|$|This was {{a weapon}} {{that could be}} fired from the shoulder, giving {{unrestricted}} traverse or elevation {{within the limits of}} the human frame, or mounted on a simple tripod.A portion of the propelling charge bled through holes in the cartridge wall and into a space around the breech and then backwards through four <b>venturis.</b> This counter blast backwards cancelled out the recoil.|$|E
5000|$|The early F11s {{were not}} as {{attractive}} or sophisticated as today - the clew of the genoa was 16" [...] above the gunwale — the mainsail hung from one full length top batten, with some short leech battens, all battens were made of cane, and the <b>venturis,</b> which were tube and box type with corks, would today be regarded as museum pieces.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most basic}} {{carbureted}} engines, such as single cylinder Briggs & Stratton lawn-mower engines, feature a single small throttle plate over a basic carburetor {{with a single}} venturi. The throttle is either open or closed (although {{there is always a}} small hole or other bypass to allow a small amount of air to flow through so the engine can idle when the throttle is closed), or some intermediate position. Since air velocity is crucial to the functioning of a carburetor, to keep average air velocity up, larger engines require more complex carburetors with multiple small <b>venturis,</b> typically two or four (these <b>venturis</b> are commonly called [...] "barrels). A typical [...] "2-barrel" [...] carburetor uses a single oval or rectangular throttle plate, and works similarly to a single venturi carburetor, but with two small openings instead of one. A 4-venturi carburetor has two pairs of <b>venturis,</b> each pair regulated by a single oval or rectangular throttle plate. Under normal operation, only one throttle plate (the [...] "primary") opens when the accelerator pedal is pressed, allowing more air into the engine, but keeping overall airflow velocity through the carburetor high (thus improving efficiency). The [...] "secondary" [...] throttle is operated either mechanically when the primary plate is opened past a certain amount, or via engine vacuum, influenced by the position of the accelerator pedal and engine load, allowing for greater air flow into the engine at high RPM and load and better efficiency at low RPM's. Multiple 2-venturi or 4-venturi carburetors can be used simultaneously in situations where maximum engine power is of priority.|$|E
50|$|By 1944 the Americans {{were using}} M1 Bazooka anti tank rocket {{launchers}} in the Pacific Theater against the Japanese. In response, the Japanese began {{development of the}} Type 4 Rocket Launcher. Unlike the US rocket that used fins to stabilize it in flight, the Japanese rocket had angled <b>venturis</b> in the base to spin the rocket for stability, similar to the 20 cm (8”) HE rocket.|$|E

5000|$|Liquid can be {{injected}} at the converging section {{or at the}} throat. Figure 2 shows liquid injected at the converging section. Thus, {{the liquid}} coats the venturi throat making it very effective for handling hot, dry inlet gas that contains dust.

5000|$|Price's cabin {{pressure}} regulator was {{the heart of}} the pressurization system. Its inlet valve regulated the flow of ventilating air to the cabin; its discharge valve opened as directed to maintain the required pressure. The valves' operations were controlled by a [...] "black box", a maze of valves, <b>venturis,</b> and pleated metal bellows. Incoming air was drawn thru slits on the wing leading edge; discharged air exited below the empennage.|$|E
