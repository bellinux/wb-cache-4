While she did not agree with the legal analysis of the Auditor General, the Speaker, Margaret Wilson, recommended that legislation be passed to retrospectively <b>validate</b> <b>expenditure,</b> that parties should pay back their overspending, not as a legal obligation, but {{in order to maintain the}} confidence of the public, that the administrative processes of Parliamentary Services should be reviewed, and that legislation be developed to clarify the law on expenditure.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{methods of}} estimating the physical activity, and energy expenditure during various activities in three unique environments using a low cost sensor platform, the GT 3 X ActiGraph accelerometer. The environments {{in this study}} included; simulated and real world horse riding, search and rescue operations, and ultra-endurance cycle racing. GT 3 X ActiGraphs were deployed in each environment to measure the associated energy expenditure of specific activities. Where possible other <b>validated</b> energy <b>expenditure</b> estimation sensors were deployed in parallel with the GT 3 X ActiGraphs. However, {{due to the nature}} and duration of deployment in the environments, this was not always possible. In these cases assumptions were made based on the activity, the subject anthropometrics and the intensity of the motions observed in order to better estimate the energy expended. Specific events were defined for each environment and the energy demands of these events were further investigated with the GT 3 X ActiGraphs. These included; the differences between simulated and outdoor horse riding at similar energy expenditure rates; the differences between sleeping environments on physical activity and sleep indices in search and rescue operators; and an analysis of the energy expended during cycling and rest periods during an ultra-endurance cycling race using proprietary and researcher developed algorithms. However, the data presented from the propitiatory software may not be capable of estimating the physical activity expended during various activities certain environments as external factors may first need to be filtered out. This calls for a combined physiological and computer science approach to be taken in further research with these sensors...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Horticulture, Washington State UniversityThe Washington State University Apple Breeding Program {{just passed}} its 20 th anniversary, {{released}} its third new variety and moved under new direction with breeder Kate Evans. The major program {{goal is to}} release a portfolio of new and improved cultivars suited to production in central Washington. Improved cultivars should have exceptional storability, to compliment the state’s unrivaled long term cold storage facilities, while engendering an exceptional consumer experience. Apple breeding is a long and expensive process and therefore exploring how well the program meets its goal—releasing the best new cultivars—can <b>validate</b> the <b>expenditures</b> of the program while also potentially finding methods that would improve discovery rate and cost efficiency. The three main subprojects and conclusions are as follows: 1) Quantify moldy core susceptibility in currently available germplasm to inform crossing decisions and discover predisposing characteristics to inform culling decisions. Factors that predispose selections for moldy core were confirmed and appear heritable. 2) Quantify fire blight resistance in wild relative Malus sieversii to further inform crossing decisions and provide data for future association mapping. Multiple M. sieversii accessions {{were found to be}} resistant and will be used in 2016 as parents. 3) Analyze the cost structure of the current breeding program and the accuracy of trait evaluations in the replicated data collection phase of the program to explore the most efficient design structure for identifying elite selections. An alternative design that would allow more selections to be evaluated in that phase was proposed and is under consideration for the 2016 planting.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{arises from}} a real life problem that a third party solution partner of health care insurance companies in Turkey faces. The company develops Electronic Claim Processing System (ECPS) that private health care insurance companies utilize in order to check and <b>validate</b> whether an <b>expenditure</b> (i. e., claims) of their customers abides {{by the rules of}} the contracts between the insurance companies and the customers as well as the insurance companies and the health care service providers. As part of their business, the company also trains and assists the health care service providers regarding to the ECPS and the regulation of the insurance companies. Every year their training staffs visit 400 + health care service providers in Istanbul and {{in order to reduce the}} total travelling cost and balance the workload among them is a problem that they face. A decision support system that utilizes fuzzy zoning as a solution for the planning problem that the company faces is being developed. In this paper the fuzzy zoning algorithm utilized for this purpose will be presented and its performance will be evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Background Overweight {{and obesity}} in {{childhood}} {{is associated with}} physical, psychological and social consequences. Physical inactivity is {{regarded as one of}} the main factors that have contributed to the increase in childhood obesity through out the world. Overweight and obesity as well as physical activity level are shown to track from childhood to adolescence and adulthood, thereby influencing not only the current health status but also long-term health. The general purpose of this thesis was to evaluate the effect of a 2 -year family-based lifestyle intervention on physical activity and metabolic health among children with overweight and obesity. Methods Children with overweight or obesity living in northern Sweden were recruited to the study. In total 105 children, mean age 10. 5 years (SD± 1. 09), were randomized into either an intervention or a control group. The intervention group was offered as a 2 -year family-based lifestyle intervention; the 1 st year consisted of 14 group sessions and during the 2 nd year the intervention was web-based. The control group did not participate in any intervention sessions, but performed all measurements. Physical activity was measured in all children using SenseWear Pro 2 Armband (SWA) during 4 consecutive days before, in the middle and after the intervention, data regarding anthropometrics and blood values were collected in the same periods. Twenty-two of the children wore SWA during 14 days before the intervention in order to <b>validate</b> energy <b>expenditure</b> (EE) estimated by SWA against EE measured with double labelled water. Results The SWA, together with software version 5. 1, proved to be a valid device to accurately estimate EE at group level of overweight and obese children. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups neither before nor after the intervention regarding physical activity and screen-time. All children significantly decreased their time being active ≥ 3 METs during the study period. After the study period, significantly fewer in the control group achieved the national physical activity recommendation, and they had significantly increased their screen-time. However, these changes were not seen within the intervention group. The intervention group had a significantly lower apolipoprotein B/A 1 compared to the control group at 1 -year measurement; no other significant differences were found regarding metabolic markers. No statistical difference was found between the groups regarding body mass index after the 2 -year study period. Conclusion Even though a comprehensive program, the 2 -year family-based lifestyle intervention had limited effects on physical activity and metabolic health in overweight and obese children. SWA is a device that can be used in future studies to measure energy expenditure among free-living overweight or obese children. SELF...|$|R
