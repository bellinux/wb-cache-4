5000|$|Recycling as an {{alternative}} to the use of landfills and recycled paper is one of the less complicated procedures in the recycling industry. Although there is not a landfill crisis at this point in time, it is commonly believed that measures should to be taken in order to lower the negative impacts of landfills, for many hazardous elements are produced and spread because of this enclosure of trash. Most recycled paper is priced higher than freshly made paper, and this tends to plays a deciding factor for the consumer. Because most of the recycled pulp is purchased in an open market, <b>virgin</b> <b>paper</b> is produced cheaper with the pulp that was made by the specific paper mill. <b>Virgin</b> <b>paper</b> contains no recycled content and is made directly from the pulp of trees or cotton. Materials recovered after the initial paper manufacturing process are considered recycled paper. Because that original standard was so vague, some “recycled papers” contained only mill scraps that would have been included in <b>virgin</b> <b>paper</b> anyway. [...] Standards have recently been set to prevent companies from making it seem like they were selling recycled paper. The collection and recycling industries have fixated on the scraps of paper that is thrown away by customers daily in order to increase the amount of recycled paper. [...] Different paper mills are structured for different types of paper, and most “recovered office paper can be sent to a deinking mill”. A deinking mill serves as a step in the recycling paper process. This type of mill detaches the ink from the paper fibers, along with any other excess materials which are also removed from the remaining paper. In the deinking mill, after all of the unwanted coatings of paper are stripped, the refurbished paper is sent to the paper machine. The old scraps are now constructed into new paper at the paper machine. Many papers mills have recycled business papers by transforming the old business papers into beneficial letters and envelopes. The production process for recycled paper is more costly than the well-developed paper mills that create paper with the use of trees. This process in making recycled paper is also much more time-consuming. However, recycling paper has a multitude of benefits from an environmental perspective. [...] “For all the state-of-the-art technology now incorporated into modern paper mills, the industry's underlying structure is still based upon a worldview that was transformative in the 19th-century but is out-of-date as the 21st century approaches”.|$|E

50|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{has found}} that {{recycling}} causes 35% less water pollution and 74% less air pollution than making <b>virgin</b> <b>paper.</b> Pulp mills can be sources of both air and water pollution, {{especially if they are}} producing bleached pulp. Modern mills produce considerably less pollution than those of a few decades ago. Recycling paper decreases the demand for virgin pulp, thus reducing the overall amount of air and water pollution associated with paper manufacture. Recycled pulp can be bleached with the same chemicals used to bleach virgin pulp, but hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydrosulfite are the most common bleaching agents. Recycled pulp, or paper made from it, is known as PCF (process chlorine free) if no chlorine-containing compounds were used in the recycling process. However, recycling mills may have polluting by-products like sludge. De-inking at Cross Pointe's Miami, Ohio mill results in sludge weighing 22% of the weight of wastepaper recycled.|$|E

Textile dust fibre, a waste generated from textile mechanical recycling has the prospect to be utilised as secondary raw material for producing novel material: textile paper suitable for packaging and other applications. A comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of carrier bags made from one ton of <b>virgin</b> <b>paper,</b> recycled paper and novel textile paper (~ 22584 paper bags with grammage of 100 g/m 2 and same dimensions for all 3 types of bags) showed that textile paper bag is more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint. The largest environmental contributors were energy consumed in the pulping and paper making processes, followed by the use of adhesives and printing ink in the conversion process of paper to papercarrier bags. A comparative Techno-economic Assessment (TEA) was carried out for the operating cost of producing the three selected carrier bag types. The analysis conveyed that textile paper bags are more economically attractive, mainly due to the partial substitution of paper fibre with low-cost textile dust fibre. Furthermore, a simple tool was developed with an attempt to assess and compare materials suitability for the circular economy considering life cycle thinking and business perspectives. Assessment of textile paper using the Circular material assessment tool indicated that there is still scope for improvement on the following circularity characteristics of circular material: scarcity of raw material, local supply of resources, clean and non-toxic resources. Textile paper material scored high in the following circularity characteristics: secondary raw material, industrial symbiosis, recycling, {{resource efficiency}} in manufacturing and use. In the final step, the textile paper bag was eco-designed through the combined and iterative LCA and TEA approach with the aim to achieve improved scores as a circular material. In order to understand the overall sustainability advantages and trade-offs, further research is recommended on different textile dust fibre grades as well as textile paper performance based on mechanical properties.

However, the transfer of undesirable compounds can occur during the shelf-life of the product. In particular, cardboard packaging represents {{an important source of}} food contamination with mineral oil, when recycled fibers or mineral oil based printing inks are used. In this work MOSH (mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons), MOAH (mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons), POSH (polyolefin oligomeric saturated hydrocarbons), and DIPN (diisopropyl naphtalenes) migration from packaging to dry foods has been monitored up to 1 year, focusing on the influence of food packaging material, fat content of the food, time and storage condition. Furthermore, contribution of hot melt adhesives used to close boxes to the total contamination was also evaluated. Semolina and egg pasta, of the same small size, were packed in plastic film bags and in recycled and virgin paperboard boxes and stored under two different conditions at ambient temperature. Same samples were stored on shelves to simulate the real common storage conditions, while others were wrapped in aluminum in order to force the migration only towards pasta, excluding any external influence. The mineral oil migration from a transport box consisting of corrugated board, through the primary packaging, was also evaluated. Migration behavior was studied measuring both the mineral oil amount lost by the packaging (calculated as the difference between pre- and post-contact contamination) and the mineral oil amount migrated in pasta samples after the exposure (subtracted from the pasta contamination at time zero). Diffusion of migrated mineral oil inside the product was also monitored by applying selective extraction methods (for semolina pasta). A POSH contamination was evident in pasta samples stored in plastic film. Very low contamination levels (< 0. 6 mg/kg of MOSH) were found in pasta sample packaged in <b>virgin</b> <b>paper.</b> An important contribution due to the use of hot melt adhesives was evidenced. Higher contamination levels (about 5 and 12 mg/kg of MOSH for semolina and egg pasta, respectively) were found in pasta packaged in recycled paperboard for 1 year.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of xerography wastepaper recycling by estimating the solubility parameter of toner {{to select a}} suitable de-inking agent has been accomplished in aqueous media. The major de-inking agents {{used in this study}} were composed of combinations of a suitable organic solvent and a surfactant. This research focused on the addition of water insoluble solvents, with their solubility parameters closely proximate to the polymeric binders in toner, to assist its initial dissolution. Subsequently, the addition of surfactant to the mixture promotes the formation of an emulsion. The ink could then be easily washed away from the pulp aqueous slurry. The most suitable de-inking agent has been identified to be the mixture of naphthalene (20 %), isoamyl acetate (80 %) and surfactant. At 20 degrees C, styrene-acrylate copolymer binder in the toner was emulsified in the pulp aqueous slurry to form a stable emulsion with a particle size of 527 nm. After repeated water washings of the pulp, the ink specks on the paper were washed away as a water emulsion and the speck of the recycled paper was lowered from 5760 ppm to less than 10 ppm. In the meantime, the brightness of the final de-inked pulp was improved from 80 % GE to 85 % GE, which is almost identical to the brightness of <b>virgin</b> unprinted <b>paper</b> (86 % GE).
