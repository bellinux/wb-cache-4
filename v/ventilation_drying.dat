40|$|A common rain control {{strategy}} to help minimize moisture damage is the rain screen wall system. This approach requires a rainscreen, a drainage plane, flashing, weep holes, and a drainage gap. Although {{this approach to}} rain control is becoming the most common, and is sometimes even mandated by codes and standards, very {{little research has been}} undertaken to define the minimum or optimal gap size required for either drainage or <b>ventilation</b> <b>drying.</b> A test method and experimental program were developed to investigate the gap size required to ensure drainage, and the role of small gaps on <b>ventilation</b> <b>drying.</b> Because of the importance of small geometrical details, full-scale wall systems were tested. The experimental method was able to gravimetrically determine the amount of drainage, storage and drying during and after a simulated wetting event. The test apparatus and method developed were shown to provide repeatable results over multiple tests as well as in an independent laboratory. The experiments to date have conclusively shown that even small gaps (less than 1 mm) can drain more water than would normally be found in a drainage gap. It was also found that in some cases small gaps will store less water than a large drainage gap. It was also found that <b>ventilation</b> <b>drying</b> can play a role in very small gaps of approximately 1 mm, at a pressure difference of only 1 Pa. More research is required to further analyze optimal ventilation gap sizes and compare the laboratory results to hygrothermal modeling...|$|E
40|$|The air {{exchange}} in rainscreen walls {{is expected to}} provide <b>ventilation</b> <b>drying</b> if excess moisture is absorbed in the wall construction. In an earlier paper, we presented a cavity airflow model and measurement based estimations of air change rates (ACH) in south-facing experimental walls. Here, {{focus is on the}} <b>ventilation</b> <b>drying</b> process and its practical implications. ACH in the experimental walls were calculated and converted into drying rates at different stages in the drying process. Furthermore, changes in the drying rates due to changes in the cavity design and in the outdoor climate were investigated. The significance of the drying rates was demonstrated in a case study. Findings showed that the cavity design is of major importance for the drying rate if the material adjacent to the cavity is wet over its entire extension. For such extreme cases, a light facade colour, vented horizontal battens and, in particular, a small cavity depth, are adverse factors for the drying rate. As the drying process proceeds and the moisture transport from the material to the cavity air becomes dependent on vapour diffusion, the drying rates for different cavity designs tend to be evened out. If the resistance to vapour flow in the material reaches high levels, a favourable outdoor climate is significantly more important than the cavity design to promote drying. Also for the case where the material adjacent to the cavity initially is only locally wet, findings showed that the cavity design is of minor importance for the drying time. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|High {{temperature}} and high relative humidity adversely affect {{the quality of}} seeds, and are features of tropical climate. Seed drying and storage are being used increasingly in developing countries to improve seed storage and quality. This study was undertaken to evaluate a range of seed drying methods and storage conditions with the view to selecting an appropriate method(s) for use in tropical countries. Pea (Pisum sativum L.) seeds at three initial seed moisture content (m. c.) of 23. 8, 18. 0 and 14. 5 % were dried to 10 % seed m. c. before storage. The performances of four different drying methods: artificial dryer (Kiwi Mini) set at 30 °C or 45 °C, natural sun drying, and in-bin natural <b>ventilation</b> <b>drying</b> were evaluated. Natural sun drying, and in-bin natural <b>ventilation</b> <b>drying</b> were conducted from March to May, 1997, when mean {{temperature and}} relative humidity during sunny days were 17 °C and 60 % respectively. The dried seeds were stored under two conditions: open storage at 20. 5 ° 0 and 55 % relative humidity (r. h.), and closed storage at 25 °C and 90 % r. h. for 20, 40, and 60 days. Time and energy consumed for drying by the different methods were determined to compare the drying efficiency when combined with quality of the seed. Deterioration of the seed due to storage conditions and drying methods used was determined by assessing their effects on seed germination, abnormal seedlings, dead seed, hollow heart percentages, and conductivity. Seed samples dried by the Kiwi Mini dryer set at 45 °C took 7 hours and those set at 30 °C took 17 hours. It took 54 hours with natural in-bin <b>ventilation</b> <b>drying,</b> while sun drying took 37 hours. However, energy consumed when drying seeds at 30 °C was 17 kWh, which was more than twice that at 45 °C. Seed germination was not significantly different between drying methods, but averaged only 75 % because of sprouting damage of the crop prior to harvest. Germinations after open and closed storage for 20 days did not differ, although some differences appeared after 40 days of storage. However, open and closed storage for 60 days significantly reduced seed germination to 54 and 33 % respectively. Because seeds are heat-sensitive, drying air temperature and drying rate are particularly important to avoid internal seed breakage, cracking and splitting, fungal growth, and loss of germination and vigour. Selected studies have shown that seed can be dried at high temperature for a short time, followed by tempering to re-distribute moisture and temperature inside the seed, thus reducing the percentage of cracking. Thus, a second experiment was conducted with maize (Zea mays L) to study the impact on seed viability of high temperature drying followed by tempering. Maize at 28. 5 % initial seed m. c. was dried at 60 °C for short periods of 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25 minutes, followed by tempering for 45 minutes at either 30 °C or 21 °C. This cycle was repeated until maize seeds were dried to 13. 0 % m. c [...] The percentage of cracked seeds, germination immediately after drying, and after an accelerated ageing test, did not differ between 30 °C and 21 °C tempering. Drying exposure times of up to 10 minutes per cycle at 60 °C caused vertical cracks in up to 50 % of seeds, but seed germination remained over 90 % and seed vigour was also maintained. The percentage of seeds with stress cracks due to high temperature drying (5 - 25 minute cycles) at 60 °C followed by tempering had polynomial relationships with seed germination and vigour. Seeds dried at the same temperature without tempering had their germination reduced from 99 to 20 %...|$|E

40|$|Residential {{buildings}} are now better engineered to manage rainwater following the leaking building problem in New Zealand. The next {{challenge is to}} improve the weathertightness of medium-rise buildings which often use joint details widely applied on low-rise buildings but are subject to higher wind pressures and surface runoff rates. This study begins to address this challenge by measuring the water leakage performance limits of the following common flashings with static and dynamic rain and wind loads to see how their performance might be improved: (a) Horizontal H and Z jointers between direct fixed sheet claddings; (b) The window head flashing in a cavity wall; (c) A horizontal apron flashing at the junction between a roof and wall. At this stage, water penetration resistances have been measured but the data has not yet been discussed in the context of wind pressures and rain loads on mid-rise buildings. All of the joints were found to resist water leakage to pressures equivalent to the hydrostatic head of the upstand, so long as there were no air leakage paths through the joint. When vents were added, or openings were present that might arise due to construction tolerances, then the onset pressure for leakage was found to fall by as much as 50 %. Vents, of course, are essential for <b>ventilation</b> <b>drying</b> in rainscreen walls and even with vents present, the onset of leakage was at generally at least twice the 50 Pa wet wall test pressure applied in New Zealand. Opportunities were found to improve the way vented joints deal with runoff by enlarging the gap between the cladding and flashing. This prevented the outer joint volume from filling with water and occluding the vents. The apron flashing was found to cope better than a window head joint with runoff, because of the larger 35 mm vertical gap between the cladding and apron...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} develop a high {{efficient}} drying system for agricultural products, some fundamental experiments for generating air at normal temperature and under lower humidity were performed. Considerations were paid about a practical combination of solid absorbent and heat pump dehumidifying methods. The efficiency of absorption and the moisture absorption for each method were investigated under practical applications. The results obtained can be summarized as follows : 1. In case of air ventilation with high humidity, the efficiency of absorption of desiccant silica gel decreased rapidly at more than 35 % (d. b.) moisture content. 2. Judging from the analysis of absorption water of desiccant silica gel, relationship between limit absorption time T (h) and thickness of sedimentary layer Xn (n : tray number) was shown as follows. T= 0. 75 + 0. 725 Xn 3. Change of absorption water of desiccant silica gel was obserbed at various sorts of the thickness of sedimentary layer (Fig. 7). The efficiency of absorption was investigated under practical applications. 4. A break point was estimated from air condition through desiccant silica gel. Average moisture content of desiccant silica gel was about 27. 5 % (d. b.) at the break point. Relationship between the break point time T (h) and ratio of silica gel weight M (kg) to air flow G (kg/h) was shown as follows. T= 0. 558 + 115. 87 (M/G) 5. Calorific value of absorbent of desiccant silica gel was measured at absorption process. The value of dried silica gel 1 kg was estimated at 450 kcal within the break point time. 6. In order to investigate the drying efficiency fitness for refreshement of desiccant silica gel, heat <b>ventilation</b> <b>drying</b> {{was carried out by}} using high moisture content silica gel. Relationship between refreshment time T (h) and M/G was shown as follows. T= 0. 475 (M/G) ^ 7. The performance of heat pump dehumidifying was investigated. In case of using air with high temperature and humidity under practical applications, removal moisture in the air could be estimated 1. 6 ～ 2. 0 kg/h by 1 kw compressor power in heat pump dehumidifier. 8. As heat pump dehumidifying efficiency changed with absolute and/or relative humidity, it was considered to be suitable for heat pump dehumidifier to have moisture removed from the high temperature and humidity air. ...|$|E

The current paper presents the modelling and subsequent validation of the drying process inside the dryer, to come out with a design tool for the CDSCD.

40|$|Wastes {{resulting}} from the nuclear electricity production have to be isolated from the biosphere {{for a very long}} period of time. For this purpose, deep underground repository in weak permeable geological layers is considered as a reliable solution for the nuclear waste storage. It is however well established that during excavation, the underground drilling process engenders cracks and eventually fractures [1] that deteriorate the hydro-mechanical properties of the surrounding host material in the so-called Excavation Damaged Zone (EDZ). The EDZ behaviour is a major issue because it may constitute a preferential flow path for radionuclide migration. Consequently, the characterisation of the material transport properties and of the transfer kinetics that occur around galleries still need to be investigated. The EDZ properties may be also affected by host rock-gallery air interactions. <b>Ventilation</b> induced <b>drying</b> may also provoke additional cracking, which potentially alters the transport properties of the damaged zone.

Multi-annual {{monitoring of}} water stable isotopes, air temperature, relative humidity, drip rates and PCO 2 in surface, soil and cave air gives detailed insight into dripwater isotopes, temperature and ventilation dynamics in Mawmluh Cave, NE India. Water isotopes vary seasonally {{in response to}} monsoonal rainfall. Most negative values are observed during late Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), with a less than one-month lag between ISM rainfall and drip response. Two dry season and two less-well distinguishable wet season dynamic ventilation regimes are identified in Mawmluh Cave. Cave air temperatures higher than surface air result in chimney <b>ventilation</b> during <b>dry</b> season nights. Dry season days show reduced ventilation due to cool cave air relative to surface air and cold-air lake development.

The objective of this study was to carry out an energy and carbon analysis of different power generation routes using wood fuel from short rotation coppice. Three scenarios of wood fuel production were considered, based on the level of intensification of cultivation practices, in terms of machinery and materials input. Local and regional transportation were distinguished, as well as natural convection or forced <b>ventilation</b> for <b>drying.</b> We also studied three conversion systems: local peak electricity generation, local cogeneration of heat and power (CHP), and centralised power generation by wood and coal pulverisation cofiring. The energy and carbon balances of different wood-energy routes were estimated by calculating direct and indirect energy and carbon costs of all their components (fuel, materials and machinery). Energy ratios of 22, 23 and 26 after storage and drying at the farm were obtained respectively for the different scenarios. An average of 1. 7 kg of carbon (kgC) is released per GJ of wood energy produced. Crop maintenance, and chemical fertilisation, account for 40 % of total energy costs and 25 % of total carbon costs of wood fuel production. Final avoided carbon emissions by fossil fuel substitution reach 6. 3 to 8. 8 tC ha(- 1) yr(- 1) with CHP, 3. 8 to 5. 4 with peak power production and 3. 3 to 4. 6 with centralised cofiring.

Five sensor arrays were located in three different places of the storage-drying facility to control the flow of air over the grain, one of them to control the inflow of air, and another one to control the condition of air outside the barn. Special equipment was made for preheating air by means of the sun and/or by firewood burned in the furnace to ensure the desirable temperature and moisture.

While the physics describing the thermal and moisture transport in the presence of air convection is understood, the pressure dynamics is still somewhat qualitatively known. With the addition of new literature data and available field generated monitored data, a simplified model for the wall air cavity ventilation was developed. The scientific approach followed initially included the benchmarking of multi-dimensional advanced hygrothermal model with laboratory and field data.

Ventilation {{is one of the}} means of controlling indoor humidity in buildings. Its effectiveness depends on the supply air moisture level and the <b>ventilation</b> rate. The <b>drier</b> the supply air is, the higher its capacity to remove indoor humidity. In a marine climate where the outdoor air is relatively moist, higher ventilation rate is required to achieve the same level of indoor humidity in a cold and dry climate. In this study, the potential benefit of interior gypsum finishing in lowering indoor humidity peaks, through the moisture buffering process, and thereby reducing ventilation rates are investigated. A field experimental study is conducted using two identical test facilities at the Whole Building Performance Research Laboratory in Burnaby, British Columbia to test this hypothesis in a marine climate. Initial benchmarking of the recently commissioned test buildings was undertaken to ensur...|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{solar drying}} {{requires}} that the drying rate, {{as a function of}} the environment and the control, is quantitatively known. A solar drying installation for waste-water sludge in Füssen, Germany, designed by Thermo-System ® and the University of Hohenheim, has been used to collect data for the establishment of a drying-rate function. In this solar dryer, wet sludge is uniformly spread over a concrete floor under a greenhouse-like transparent cover. The sludge is intermittently mixed by means of a autonomous robot (electric mole®), while the air under the cover is ventilated (horizontally) and mixed (vertically) by electric fans. Data of evaporation rate, environmental conditions and control operations were collected over three drying cycles. Evaporation rate via sludge sampling and via vapour balance across the structure compared favourably, justifying the use of the hourly vapour-balance data to develop linear regression and non-linear neural network (NN) models to predict the evaporation rate. The most important predictors of evaporation turn out to be (1) outdoor solar radiation (2) outdoor air temperature, and (3) the <b>ventilation</b> flux. The <b>dry</b> solids content of the sludge is next in importance, but could not be quantified with confidence over the domain, for lack of sufficient data. Air-mixing is an order of magnitude less effective than ventilation. The experimental design did not include different rates of sludge mixing...|$|R
40|$|Liquid {{water in}} low sloped roofs almost always causes problems. Roofs are {{designed}} only {{to control the}} migration of vapor, if at all. Small amounts of water leakage/penetration, may cause mold growth or catastrophic corrosion in current roofs systems. In a recent paper by the authors the effect of exterior surface emissive and absorptive properties {{was found to have}} a significant effect on the moisture performance of a roof that had a leak. Depending on the surface characteristics, roof systems can be designed to effectively manage water penetration, but at an energy cost. In the roofs system examined previously, air leakage was not included. In the present study, the authors reinvestigated the effect of water penetration and the influence of air leakage on the hygrothermal performance of a few selected roofs. The drying potential of a groove ventilated roof is examined. The performance concept is based on the fact that warming up of air in the groove increases it's ability to transport moisture to the outside. Solar radiation raises the temperature of air in the grooves and on average, during a sunny summer day 0. 5 L of water can be ventilated out of the roof per 1 m width of the roof. In this paper, one climatic condition was investigated; a hot and humid Climate representative of Houston, TX. The specific questions that the paper addresses are: What are the vapor and liquid control dynamic involved in the moisture migration of a roof in Houston TX? and how does airflow influence the performance of a roof that is initially wet ? A state-of-the-art numerical model was used to address these issues. Results showed that the drying potential depends on the ventilation rates. The roof system with <b>ventilation</b> grooves <b>dried</b> out faster from the initially wet stage than the roof without the ventilation grooves. The total increase in heat loss of the roof was found to be between 0 - 5 % depending on the thickness of the insulation. The ventilation can cool down the temperature of the roof in the middle of a hot and sunny day thus reducing the heat load to the inside...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The present work {{deals with}} axial flow fans that are {{primarily}} used for providing the required airflow for heat and mass transfer {{operations in the}} various industrial equipment and processes. It {{can be used for}} cooling, <b>ventilation</b> or for <b>drying</b> purposes. These include cooling towers for air-conditioning and ventilation, humidifiers in textile mills, air heat exchangers for various chemical processes, ventilation and exhaust as in mining industry. In consideration of all these application various efforts in the past have been done to evaluate the performance of axial flow fans. In the present work computational investigation of axial flow fan with Forward and Backward Skewed blade profile carried out using CFD software FLUENT 6. 3 and the results are compared with the experimental results from literature. The CFD analysis is done by modeling the axial fan in GAMBIT 2. 2 and using Standard k-є model with the Standard wall function for modeling turbulence. The analysis is carried out with blade stagger angle of 25 o, Skewed angle of 8. 3 o and at 1440 rpm and 1800 rpm. The aim is to analyze fan with these two types of profiles and compare the static pressure, flow rate, flow coefficient and pressure coefficient generated by fan and hence finding the efficiency of an axial flow fan. After carrying out computational investigation it is found that computational results holds good agreement with the experimental results taken from the literature...|$|R
40|$|Temperatures and {{relative}} humidities in ventilated and unventilated attics. Measurements and calculations in attics with loose fill insulation of mineral wool and cellulose fibre In well-insulated houses with a ventilated attic {{there is a}} risk for condensation and high RH during the winter. One way to lower the RH and thereby decrease the risk of damage by mildew and rot is to decrease the outdoor air ventilation of the attic. This is possible only in cases where the roof has no air leakage from the inside. This means that the ceiling must be airtight and that there always is an underpreassure compared to the attic. Measurements have been made in a test roof space employing six different forms of structures. Two structures, one with mineral wool insulation, the other with cellulose fibre insulation, are ventilated with fans to a degree of 2 ach, two structures are naturally ventilated and two are not ventilated at all. The study shows that low <b>ventilation</b> gives a <b>drier</b> climate in the attic and that lower ventilation rate gives smaller differences in RH during day and night. There is only a slight difference in performance of the attics with cellulose fiber insulations compared to those with mineral wool insulation. Four researchers have made calculations of temperature and RH outgoing from outdoor climate and data of materials and constructions of the six structures. In some cases the agreement with measured results was very good, in other cases not so good...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to Chicago, Evanston {{has had to}} take drastic measures to deal with epidemic. Evanston officials ordered closing of all schools, churches, theaters, and places of public gathering. Children under 16 ordered to remain home. Citizens ordered to not gather even in small groups. • Clarence T. Roome, Commissioner of the health board, reported {{that in the last}} 36 hours there have been 200 new cases of the flu and 6 deaths. These numbers are much larger than those reported for the past 12 days. • Authorities in Chicago have concluded that similar measures are not necessary in the city. However, they urge the public to continue to take precautions, avoiding the sick, refraining from coughing or sneezing in public, wearing proper clothing, and isolating those who show signs of sickness. • Chicago authorities believe good weather is responsible for bringing spread of flu to a standstill; worry about bad weather reversing trend. • “We don’t wish to close the schools, believing a better check and watch can be kept on the children. In the same way, the ‘movie’ theaters are educating the public by displaying slides advising precautions. If the people will be vigilant and careful, we will win the fight here without resort to measures that would paralyze public activity. But we must have that popular co-operation. ”• Red Cross has made another “urgent” call for volunteer nurses. • In last 48 hours in Chicago, there have been 1, 628 new cases of flu and 21 deaths; 323 new cases of pneumonia and 93 deaths. This is an increase from last report. • Dr. Robertson reports that more men than women are dying from pneumonia. The numbers are equal for deaths from flu. A majority of victims (of flu? death from such?) are between 30 and 40. Many victims are between 5 and 10 years of age. • Robertson called for the stop of “dry sweeping” of elevated street cars. Also, asked police to warn principles of parochial schools about dangers associated with poor <b>ventilation</b> and <b>dry</b> sweeping. • On North Shore, Wilmette and Evanston have still not reached their peak according to Dr. Drake. • Camp Grant reports that it has enough nurses and that conditions are improving.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of tropical cyclone intensity to <b>ventilation</b> of cooler, <b>drier</b> {{air into the}} inner core is examined using an axisymmetric tropical cyclone model with parameterized ventilation. Sufficiently strong ventilation induces cooling of the upper-level warm core, {{a shift in the}} secondary circulation radially outward, and a decrease in the simulated intensity. Increasing the strength of the ventilation and placing the ventilation at middle to lower levels results in a greater decrease in the quasi-steady intensity, whereas upper-level ventilation has little effect on the intensity. For strong ventilation, an oscillatory intensity regime materializes and is tied to transient convective bursts and strong downdrafts into the boundary layer. The {{sensitivity of}} tropical cyclone intensity to ventilation can be viewed {{in the context of the}} mechanical efficiency of the inner core or a modified thermal wind relation. In the former, ventilation decreases the mechanical efficiency, as the generation of available potential energy is wasted by entropy mixing above the boundary layer. In the latter, ventilation weakens the eyewall entropy front, resulting in a decrease in the intensity by thermal wind arguments. The experiments also support the existence of a threshold ventilation beyond which a tropical cyclone cannot be maintained. Downdrafts overwhelm surface fluxes, leading to a precipitous drop in intensity and a severe degradation of structure in such a scenario. For a given amount of ventilation below the threshold, there exists a minimum initial intensity necessary for intensification to the quasi-steady intensity. National Science Foundation (U. S.) (Grant ATM- 0850639...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{modelling}} {{benchmark exercise}} from the DECOVALEX- 2011 project is presented. The benchmark {{is based on}} the performance and results of a laboratory drying test and of the ventilation experiment (VE) carried out in the Mont Terri Underground Rock Laboratory (URL). Both tests involve Opalinus clay. The work aims at the identification, understanding and quantification of mechanisms taking place during the ventilation of a gallery in argillaceous host rocks on one hand and at investigating the capacity of different codes and individuals to reproduce these processes on the other hand. The 4 -year in situ VE took place in a 1. 3 m diameter unlined tunnel and included two resaturation–desaturation cycles. The test area was equipped with over one hundred sensors (including the global water mass balance of the system, relative humidity (RH), water content, liquid pressure, relative displacement and concentration of some chemical species) to monitor the rock behaviour during <b>ventilation.</b> The laboratory <b>drying</b> experiment, carried out before the VE, was designed to mimic the in situ conditions. The work was organized in a progressive manner in terms of complexity of the computations to be performed, geared towards the full hydro-mechano-chemical (HMC) understanding of the VE, the final objective. The main results from the modelling work reported herein are that the response of the host rock to ventilation in argillaceous rocks is mainly governed by hydraulic processes (advective Darcy flow and non-advective vapour diffusion) and that the hydro-mechanical (TM) back coupling is weak. A ventilation experiment may thus be regarded as a large scale-long time pump test and it is used to determine the hydraulic conductivity of the rock mass...|$|R
40|$|The membrane-bound metalloproteinase, neutral endopeptidase (NEP), is a {{degrading}} enzyme of both bronchoconstrictor and bronchodilator peptides {{within the}} airways. To examine {{the role of}} NEP in exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in asthmatic subjects, we used inhaled thiorphan, a NEP inhibitor, as pretreatment to a 6 -min standardized exercise challenge. Thirteen clinically stable asthmatic subjects participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study that was performed on 2 days separated by 48 h. Thiorphan was administered by two inhalations of 0. 5 ml containing 1. 25 mg/ml. Subsequently, exercise was performed on a bicycle ergometer at 40 - 50 % of predicted maximal voluntary <b>ventilation</b> while inhaling <b>dry</b> air (20 degrees C, relative humidity 6 %). The airway response to exercise was measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) every 3 min, up to 30 min postexercise challenge, and was expressed both as the maximal percent fall in FEV 1 from baseline and as the area under the time-response curve (AUC) (0 - 30 min). The acute effects of both pretreatments on baseline FEV 1 were not different (P > 0. 2), neither was there any difference in maximal percent fall in FEV 1 between thiorphan and placebo (P > 0. 7). However, compared with placebo, thiorphan reduced the AUC by, on average, 26 % [AUC (0 - 30 min, +/-SE) : 213. 6 +/- 47. 7 (thiorphan) and 288. 6 +/- 46. 0 %fall. h (placebo); P = 0. 047]. These data indicate that NEP inhibition by thiorphan reduces EIB during the recovery period. This suggests that bronchodilator NEP substrates, such as vasoactive intestinal polypeptide or atrial natriuretic peptide, modulate EIB in patients with asthm...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to design and test a system capable of dehumidifying air in a {{greenhouse}} when a thermal screen is in use. Dehumidification is required to reduce the risk of fungal diseases and prevent physiological disorders. The most common procedure used to remove moisture from a greenhouse fitted with a thermal screen is to open slightly the thermal screen. This causes an exchange between the relatively dry air above the screen and the humid air below the screen. However, this procedure is difficult to control and it can cause horizontal temperature differences in the greenhouse, which negatively effect crop production. In the dehumidification system proposed here, outside air is exchanged at low level with greenhouse air. This <b>ventilation</b> with cool <b>dry</b> outside air is mechanically controlled using an air distribution system. The dry air is injected near the greenhouse floor thereby forcing humid air to pass through the thermal screen. The excess air in the greenhouse then flows out through leaks in the cover. The airflow required by the system throughout the year, being dependent on the evaporation of the crop and the outside conditions, was determined using a greenhouse-climate simulation model. The model was validated using climate data from the commercial greenhouse where the system was installed. The dimensions of the system were calculated from the results of the model and a control strategy was suggested. The model calculations showed that using outside air for vapour removal is more energy efficient than using air from above the thermal screen. The distribution of climate in the greenhouse using the conventional and proposed methods of vapour removal was investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The system was tested in a commercial greenhouse and compared to a conventional system at the same location. The performance of the system, as determined by the dynamic simulation model, proved to be efficient and the climate proved to be more homogenous, as was predicted by the CFD calculation...|$|R
