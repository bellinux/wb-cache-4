5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, <b>vinyl</b> <b>bromide</b> can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.|$|E

50|$|In {{cross-coupling}} reactions, typically vinyl iodides react {{faster and}} under more mild conditions than vinyl chloride and <b>vinyl</b> <b>bromide.</b> The order of reactivity {{is based on}} the strength of carbon-halogen bond. C-I bond is the weakest of the halogens, the bond dissociation energies of C-I is 57.6kcal/mol, while fluoride, chloride and bromide are 115, 83.7, 72.1 kcal/mol respectively. As a result of having weaker bond, vinyl iodide does not polymerize as easily as its vinyl halide counterparts, but rather decompose and release iodide.It is generally believed that vinyl iodide cannot survive common reduction conditions, which reduces the vinyl iodide to an olefin or unsaturated alkane. However, there is evidence in literature, in which a propargyl alcohol's alkyne was reduced in presence of a vinyl iodide using hydrogen over Pd/CaCO3 or Crabtree's catalyst.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAn {{efficient}} and straightforward copper-catalyzed method allowing vinylation of N- or O-nucleophiles with di- or trisubstituted <b>vinyl</b> <b>bromides</b> is reported. The procedure is applicable {{to a broad}} range of substrates since N-vinylation of mono-, di- and triazoles as well as O-vinylation of phenol derivatives can be performed by the mean of catalytic amounts of copper iodide and inexpensive nitrogen ligands 3 or 8. In the case of more hindered <b>vinyl</b> <b>bromides,</b> the use of the original bidentate chelator 8 was shown to be more efficient to promote the coupling reactions than our key tetradentate ligand 3. Corresponding N-(1 -alkenyl) -azoles and alkenyl aryl ethers are obtained in high yields and selectivities in very mild temperature conditions (35 - 110 °C for N-vinylation reactions and 50 - 80 °C for O-vinylation reactions). Moreover, to our knowledge, this method is the first example of a copper-catalyzed vinylation of various azoles. Finally, this protocol, practical at the scale of the laboratory and easily adaptable to an industrial scale, is very competitive compared to the whole of existing methods allowing the syntheses of such compounds...|$|R

5000|$|The total {{synthesis}} of Aflatoxin B2 is a multistep sequence {{that begins with}} a 2+3cycloaddition between the quinone 1 and the 2,3-Dihydrofuran. This reaction is catalyzed by a CBS catalyst and is enantioselective. The next step is the orthoformylation of reaction product 2 in a Duff reaction. The hydroxyl group in 3 is esterified with triflic anhydride which adds a triflate protecting group. This step enables a Grignard reaction of the aldehyde group in 4 with methylmagnesiumbromide to the alcohol 5 which is then oxidized with the Dess-Martin periodinane to the ketone 6. A Baeyer-Villiger oxidation converts the ketone to an ester (7) and a reduction with Raney nickel converts the ester into an alcohol and removes the triflic acid group.

5000|$|The {{synthesis}} of pyrethrin I involves the esterification of (+)-trans-chrysanthemic acid with (S)-(Z)-pyrethrolone. One synthetic method {{for each of}} these is shown in the images below. Sobti and Dev of the Malti-Chem Research Centre in Nadesari, vadodara, India published this method for chrysanthemic acid in 1974. The starting material for the synthesis uses commercially available (+)-3α, 4α-epoxycarane (1). A lactone is eventually formed and the ring is opened by the use of a Grignard reagent to give (+)-trans-chrysanthemic acid.
