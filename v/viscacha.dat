5|$|More {{than ten}} species of mammals have been {{observed}} in the park, several of them endangered, including the colocolo, the Andean mountain cat, the spectacled bear, the taruca deer, the vicuña, the white-tailed deer, the puma, the northern <b>viscacha,</b> the long-tailed weasel, the hog-nosed skunk and the Andean fox.|$|E
5|$|L. ahuacaense was {{the fourth}} species of the genus Lagidium to be described, after L.peruanum, L.viscacia, and L.wolffsohni of the central and {{southern}} Andes, although more species may eventually be recognized within L.peruanum and L.viscacia, and L.wolffsohni is poorly differentiated from L.viscacia. Together with the plains <b>viscacha</b> (Lagostomus maximus) and the chinchillas (Chinchilla), Lagidium forms the rodent family Chinchillidae. Within Lagidium, L.ahuacaense differs by at least 7.9% from all other species in DNA sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. A cladistic analysis placed the Ecuadorian species as the sister group to all other Lagidium species, but support for this placement was not strong. Morphometric analysis also confirmed the Ecuadorian population is different from other Lagidium species.|$|E
500|$|Lagidium ahuacaense is a rodent in the {{mountain}} <b>viscacha</b> genus (Lagidium) that occurs in southern Ecuador. First observed in 2005 and formally described in 2009, it occurs more than [...] north of the nearest previously known population of mountain viscachas in central Peru. Only a single population is known, found on rocky habitats on Cerro El Ahuaca, an isolated granite mountain in southern Ecuador, and as few as several dozen individuals remain. The species is threatened by fires and grazing cattle, and the discoverers recommended its conservation status be assessed as critically endangered.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{threatened}} by fires, used to maintain crop fields in the vicinity, which frequently {{get out of control}} and destroy part of the <b>viscacha's</b> habitat on the Cerro, and by competition for food with grazing cattle. However, the species is unknown to the local people and is not hunted. In view of its small range and population, Ledesma and colleagues recommended the species be assessed as critically endangered under the IUCN Red List criteria and recommended immediate conservation action to protect the Cerro El Ahuaca population and further research into its biology.|$|R
2500|$|The red <b>viscacha</b> rat (Tympanoctomys barrerae) has {{a record}} C-value among mammals—9.2 pg. Although tetrapoidy was first {{proposed}} to be a reason for its high genome size and diploid chromosome number, Svartman et al. showed that the high genome size {{was due to the}} enormous amplification of heterochromatin. Although one single copy [...] gene was found to be duplicated in its genome, data on absence of large genome segment duplications (single paints of most Octodon degu probes) and repetitive DNA hybridization evidence rules against tetraploidy. The study of heterochromatin composition, repeated DNA amount and its distribution on chromosomes of octodontids is absolutely necessary to define exactly what heterochromatin fraction is responsible for the large genomes of the red <b>viscacha</b> rat.|$|E
2500|$|An octodontid rodent of Argentina's harsh desert regions, {{known as}} the plains <b>viscacha</b> rat (Tympanoctomys barrerae) has been {{reported}} as an exception to this 'rule'. However, careful analysis using chromosome paints shows {{that there are only}} two copies of each chromosome in T. barrerae, not the four expected if it were truly a tetraploid. This rodent is not a rat, but kin to guinea pigs and chinchillas. Its [...] "new" [...] diploid [...] number is 102 and so its cells are roughly twice normal size. Its closest living relation is Octomys mimax, the Andean Viscacha-Rat of the same family, whose 2n = 56. It was therefore surmised that an Octomys-like ancestor produced tetraploid (i.e., 2n = 4x = 112) offspring that were, by virtue of their doubled chromosomes, reproductively isolated from their parents.|$|E

5000|$|The golden <b>viscacha</b> rat or golden vizcacha rat (Pipanacoctomys aureus) is {{the single}} species of the genus Pipanacoctomys of the rodent family Octodontidae.

This octodontid and its sister-species, the plains <b>viscacha</b> rat (Tympanoctomys barrerae) (2n = 102), may have arisen from the diploid mountain <b>viscacha</b> rat (Octomys mimax), (2x = 2n = 56) {{as a result of}} the doubling and subsequent loss of some chromosomes.

50|$|Six {{different}} species of carnivores live in the Andes Mountain range. Three of these species are cats, the Andean cat, the pampas cat, and the puma. The puma is a large predator, while the Andean and Pampas Cat are medium-sized predators. These two medium-sized predators are very much alike. They both hunt within the same territory. They hunt the same prey, the mountain <b>viscacha</b> (Lagidium viscacia). The <b>viscacha</b> makes up 93.9% of the biomass consumed in the Andean cat's diet while the Pampas Cat depends on it for 74.8% of its biomass consumption. Both of these cats depend on a specific prey {{to make up a}} large portion of their dietary needs. In some areas, the mountain <b>viscacha</b> will make up 53% of the Andean cat's prey items. This is because the other prey items are so significantly smaller that even though the Andean cat will successfully hunt, kill, and eat a mountain <b>viscacha</b> half the time, the mountain <b>viscacha</b> is so much larger than the other food items, it makes up more substance. They also hunt frequently during the same periods. During one study, both the Andean cat and the Pampas Cat were seen most frequently during moonless nights; the second most sightings of these cats were during full moons. These two cats both hunt the same prey, making it more difficult for them to find food, essentially creating a race to find the prey before the other does.|$|E
