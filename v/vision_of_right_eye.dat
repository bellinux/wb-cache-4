40|$|Abstract. Acanthamoeba is an {{uncommon}} cause of keratitis {{but one of}} the most severe because of the prolonged and painful course of the disease and poor visual outcome. Although contact lens use is the principal risk factor, about 10 % of cases occur following trauma and exposure to contaminated soil or water. Two cases of Acanthamoeba keratitis involving women contact lens wearers have previously been reported in Malaysia but this is the first time, a non contact lens related Acanthamoeba keratitis is reported. The case involved a 28 year old Indonesian male construction worker who had a trauma <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> during work. His eye was struck by sand and dust particles after which he quickly washed with water from an open tank at the construction site. He experienced pain, redness, glaring and blurring <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> three days later. The diagnosis was missed at initial presentation but culture of the corneal scraping had proven Acanthamoeba as the aetiological agent.

REPORT OF CASE The patient, a 21 -year-old white woman, had been in good health until December, 1952, when she suddenly developed blurred <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the left eye.

The left central cornea was thinned and there was neither an anterior chamber flare nor new corneal vessels. This corneal condition required a corneal allograft, performed quickly because of the potential risk of perforation. Histopathological study of the corneal button showed a central corneal thinning with an increase in epithelial thickness. The corneal stroma was disorganized, with irregular collagen bundles. No inflammatory cells could be observed, however. All the histopathological changes observed were those of a corneal scar...|$|R

A 75 -year-old woman with a history of limbal malignant melanoma presented with loss <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> in <b>right</b> <b>eye.</b> Corneal examination showed a patchy melanotic pigmentation with a central haze. Topical mitomycin-C improved visual acuity and corneal haze. However, the pigmented lesions persisted, and they were removed with alcohol corneal epitheliectomy. Histopathological examination demonstrated primary acquired melanosis without atypia. The lesions were successfully removed, and there were no recurrences during the follow-up period of 36 months. The association of conjunctival and corneal melanosis without atypia is a rare condition. In addition, co-existence of central corneal haze and melanosis may decrease visual acuity. Topical mitomycin-C and alcohol corneal epitheliectomy can be useful treatments in this condition...|$|R

Fundus examination of both eye showed multiple hard exudates at macula with a plaque involving the foveal center in <b>right</b> <b>eye.</b> OCT and FFA confirmed the findings seen clinically. Patient was advised regular follow up and on 3 months follow up his clinical picture was same. Ours is the first case report where patient had significant visual loss secondary to hard exudate plaque at center of fovea and ischemic fovea in <b>right</b> <b>eye.</b> Presence <b>of</b> hard exudates at any stage of therapy of hepatitis C could be {{an indicator of the}} severity of retinopathy with possible indication for stopping the drug...|$|R
40|$|Granulocytic sarcoma or chloroma, {{a manifestation}} of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rare cause of {{childhood}} proptosis. A 14 -year-old boy presented with progressively increasing unilateral proptosis and swelling of lower eyelid and face on the right side. Contrast enhanced computed tomographic images revealed enhancing infiltrates occupying the right orbit, maxillary antrum, and infratemporal fossa. Incisional biopsy from the orbital swelling and the bone marrow aspirate showing leukemic blast cells confirmed the diagnosis of AML. The peripheral smear was normal initially, but high total leukocytic count with immature blast cells was evident after 1 -month of presentation. Chemotherapy brought about the remission of the disease. However, the delay in diagnosis because of negative peripheral blood smear examination and inconclusive fine-needle aspiration biopsy led to the loss <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> in <b>right</b> <b>eye.</b> Diagnosis <b>of</b> such {{case can be made}} by a combination of good clinical examination and relevant investigations. This case of maxillo-orbital granulocytic sarcoma is reported because of its rarity and to emphasize the clinical and cyto-histological features and problems concerning differential diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{a case of}} tamoxifen toxicity superimposed on central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR). We review the role of estrogen {{and the effect of}} tamoxifen on ocular tissues. Observations: A 32 -year-old Hispanic female with infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast (T 2 N 1 M 0, triple-positive), status post chemotherapy and bilateral mastectomy, presented with complaint of a floater and decreased central <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> (OD). Symptoms began three weeks after initiating tamoxifen and five months after the last cycle of chemotherapy and dexamethasone. Visual acuity (VA) was 20 / 30 OD at presentation. Clinical examination and multimodal imaging revealed subretinal fluid (SRF) and pigment epithelial detachment (PED) suggestive of CSCR. After one month of monitoring, VA improved to 20 / 20; there was SRF resolution, small PED, and focal ellipsoid zone (EZ) band loss. Two weeks later, after undergoing surgery and starting a topical steroid, she returned with count fingers (CF) VA and large SRF OD. Steroid cessation improved SRF after one month, but VA was unchanged. Tamoxifen was discontinued, and VA improved to 20 / 100 with near-complete resolution of SRF at three weeks, and significant reduction in choroidal thickness at two months. At final follow-up, VA was 20 / 200, and there was focal EZ band loss sub-foveally, minimal SRF, and small PED. Conclusions and Importance: Treatment with tamoxifen may lead to ocular toxicity and can complicate the recovery course of patients affected with CSCR. Variations in levels of the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α) and treatment with tamoxifen (ER-α partial agonist) may lead to loss of the protective effect of estrogen in the retinal pigment epithelial cells in premenopausal women. Furthermore, tamoxifen toxicity can lead to focal photoreceptor loss. Treatment in these cases should be coordinated together with the oncologist...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Non-arteritic {{anterior}} ischemic {{optic neuropathy}} (NA-AION) is typically a disorder of patients 50 {{years and older}} predisposed to the vascular and structural optic disc risk factors. We present an interesting case of sequential development of NA-AION in a 45 -year-old patient with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis. Methods: Observational case report. Results: A 45 -year-old female on hemodialysis for chronic renal failure complained of sequential acute onset sudden painless gross diminution <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> in <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> followed by the left eye. At presentation, fundus examination revealed secondary optic atrophy and a pallid disc edema with few hemorrhage in the <b>right</b> and left <b>eye,</b> respectively. Ambulatory blood pressure recorded nocturnal dips of diastolic blood pressure. Fundus fluorescein angiography showed hypoperfusion of the left optic disc, confirming the diagnosis of NA-AION. She was treated with oral steroids, but with no improvement. Conclusion: Both treating nephrologist and ophthalmologist {{should be aware of}} this uncommon but potentially blinding complication, to permit its early recognition and prevent the occurrence in the fellow eye. Also, care should be taken to prevent and treat any hypotensive episodes during and following dialysis therapy in such high-risk patients...|$|R
