500|$|Henry Nock (1741–1804) was a British {{inventor}} and engineer of the Napoleonic period, {{best known}} as a gunsmith. [...] Nock produced many innovative weapons including the screwless lock and the seven-barrelled <b>volley</b> <b>gun,</b> although he did not invent the latter despite it commonly being known as the Nock gun. [...] He was a major supplier to the military during the Napoleonic wars. [...] His high quality duelling pistols and double-barrelled shotguns were much sought after and it is largely through Nock that the latter became the weapon of choice for hunters.|$|E
500|$|James Wilson came to Nock in 1779 to {{make the}} prototypes for his <b>volley</b> <b>gun</b> design. [...] Nock won the {{subsequent}} competitive bid {{for the production of}} the gun. [...] The weapon is consequently commonly referred to as the Nock gun. [...] Nock also produced some volley guns and volley pistols for the civilian market but in very small numbers. [...] This included a set of these weapons for the Royal Household which is still in the Queen's collection today. [...] This set is not standard production. [...] It has, for instance, silver mounts by Mark Bock, a London silversmith.|$|E
50|$|The {{weapon was}} {{probably}} never built, and was passed over {{in favor of}} <b>volley</b> <b>guns</b> like the Billinghurst Requa Battery.|$|R
50|$|The Montigny mitrailleuse was {{designed}} to defend narrow defensive positions such as the moats of fortresses. The Belgian army initially purchased Fafschamps <b>volley</b> <b>guns.</b> Only later did they acquire Montigny mitrailleuses.|$|R
50|$|In Poland, cannons {{with as many}} {{as seven}} barrels were in use in the 16th century. These were similar to the <b>volley</b> <b>guns</b> and organ battery of the 19th century, but in a larger caliber.|$|R
500|$|The name of Nock {{is perhaps}} best known today for the multi-barrelled Nock gun due to it being {{featured}} in several films. [...] These include uses of this <b>volley</b> <b>gun</b> by the characters Patrick Harper in Sharpe and Jim Bowie in The Alamo. Nock was the manufacturer, but not the inventor, of this weapon. Despite its portrayal in film, this weapon was not very practical as a hand weapon due its very severe recoil, often causing injuries, and {{the time needed to}} reload the seven barrels. [...] It was necessary to abandon the rifling of the early prototypes and reduce the charge to keep this problem manageable. Intended as a naval weapon fired from the rigging to repel boarders on the deck, it was retired by the Royal Navy in 1804. [...] Nock also produced some experimental rotating multi-barrelled guns to fire one barrel at a time.|$|E
2500|$|A mitrailleuse ( [...] ; from French mitraille, [...] "grapeshot") {{is a type}} of <b>volley</b> <b>gun</b> with {{multiple}} barrels of rifle calibre that can fire either multiple rounds at once or several rounds in rapid succession. The earliest true mitrailleuse was invented in 1851 by Belgian Army Captain Fafschamps, 10 years before the advent of the Gatling gun. It was followed by the Belgian Montigny mitrailleuse in 1863. Then the French 25 barrel [...] "Canon à Balles", better known as the Reffye mitrailleuse, was adopted in great secrecy in 1866. It became the first rapid-firing weapon deployed as standard equipment by any army in a major conflict when it was used during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. A steel block containing twenty-five 13mm (.51 calibre) centre-fire cartridges was locked against the breech before firing. With the rotation of a crank, the 25 rounds were discharged in rapid succession. The sustainable firing rate of the Reffye mitrailleuse was 100 rounds per minute. The maximum effective range of the Reffye mitrailleuse was about 2000 yards; a distance which placed their batteries beyond the reach of Prussian Dreyse needle rifle fire. Reffye mitrailleuses were deployed in six gun batteries and were manned by artillery personnel. They were not infantry support weapons but rather a form of special artillery.|$|E
2500|$|The first [...] "mitrailleuse" [...] was a {{manually}} fired 50-barrel <b>volley</b> <b>gun</b> {{originally developed}} in Belgium in 1851 by the Belgian Army Captain Fafschamps, {{who made a}} rough prototype and drawings of his invention. The system was improved during the 1850s by Louis Christophe and the Belgian engineer Joseph Montigny, with {{the completion of the}} 37-barrel Montigny mitrailleuse in 1863. [...] From 1859, Joseph Montigny proposed his design to Napoleon III, which {{led to the development of}} the French Reffye mitrailleuse, designed by Jean-Baptiste Verchère de Reffye with the collaboration of Montigny, and which was adopted by the French Army in 1865. Initially kept under wraps as a secret weapon, it was widely used in battle by French artillery during the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71). Smaller numbers of other designs, including the Gatling gun, were also purchased by the French government during the latter part of that conflict. [...] The Reffye model had initially been built in small numbers and in secrecy: only about 200 were available at the beginning of the conflict. [...] This also kept regular French field artillery in a neglected position in the eyes of French emperor Napoleon III, with dire consequences during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} and mid-19th century, a number of rapid-firing weapons {{appeared}} which offered multi-shot fire, mostly <b>volley</b> <b>guns.</b> <b>Volley</b> <b>guns</b> (such as the Mitrailleuse) and double barreled pistols relied on duplicating {{all parts of the}} gun, though the Nock gun used the otherwise-undesirable [...] "chain fire" [...] phenomenon (where multiple chambers are ignited at once) to propagate a spark from a single flintlock mechanism to multiple barrels. Pepperbox pistols also did away with needing multiple hammers but used multiple manually operated barrels. Revolvers further reduced this to only needing a pre-prepared cylinder and linked advancing the cylinder to cocking the hammer. However, these were still manually operated.|$|R
50|$|Multiple barrel {{firearms}} {{date back}} to the 14th century, when the first <b>volley</b> <b>guns</b> were developed. Originally a primitive attempt of rapid fire before the introduction of belt-feed/magazines and automatic weapons, the application of multiple barrels to modern automatic weapons such as the M134 Minigun have effective performance on the battlefield.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} designs of {{electronically}} fired explosive-propulsion projectile weapons and non-explosive projectile weapons {{were developed by}} Metal Storm Limited which had some similarities to 18th-century <b>volley</b> <b>guns,</b> particularly in that they use many barrels which can be fired all at once or in sequence such as the Nordenfelt gun. These designs met with little commercial interest and Metal Storm Limited entered administration in 2012.|$|R

5000|$|While {{technical}} {{use of the}} term [...] "machine gun" [...] has varied, the modern definition used by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute of America is [...] "A fully automatic firearm that loads, fires and ejects continuously when the trigger is held to the rear until the ammunition is exhausted or pressure on the trigger is released." [...] This definition excludes most early manually operated repeating arms such as <b>volley</b> <b>guns</b> and the Gatling gun.|$|R
50|$|Not {{long after}} the very {{beginning}} of firearms, inventors began experimenting with multi-barreled weapons in the quest for the ability to fire more than one shot before needing to reload. Not surprisingly, all types of firearms were included in their efforts, from <b>volley</b> <b>guns</b> to analogously devised handguns. Before anyone had developed a practical capability for delivering multiple loads to one barrel in quick succession (which is how repeating fire is usually accomplished today), gunsmiths were aggregating multiple loaded barrels into one place.|$|R
2500|$|Its {{failure to}} have much effect in the field led to a belief that rapid-fire weapons were useless. United States Army General William Babcock Hazen, who {{observed}} the war, commented that [...] "The French mitrailleuse had {{failed to live up}} to expectations. [...] The Germans hold it in great contempt, and it will hardly become a permanent military arm." [...] Strictly speaking, manually operated <b>volley</b> <b>guns</b> such as the Reffye mitrailleuse were a technological dead-end, and they were soon replaced by fully automatic machine guns.|$|R

50|$|The Empire has an {{artillery}} school at Nuln that supplies the gunners and engineers to operate their artillery. The {{majority of the}} artillery are Cannon and Mortars. The Empire also uses experimental artillery {{in the form of}} the Helblaster <b>Volley</b> <b>Gun,</b> a carriage mounting several barrels similar to a repeating Handgun but on a larger scale, as well as the Helstorm Rocket Battery. Both of these are available in plastic kits. When used in games, the Helblaster <b>Volley</b> <b>Gun</b> and the Helstorm Rocket Battery are extremely unreliable, but are potently devastating and capable of wiping out ranks of the enemy with good dice rolls (or blowing up in your face with bad rolls).|$|E
50|$|Loading {{systems in}} early manual machine guns were often from a hopper of loose (un-linked) cartridges. Manual-operated <b>volley</b> <b>guns</b> usually {{had to be}} reloaded {{manually}} all at once (each barrel reloaded by hand, or {{with a set of}} cartridges affixed to a plate that was inserted into the weapon). With hoppers, the rounds could often be added while the weapon was firing. This gradually changed to belt-fed types. Belts were either held in the open by the person, or in a bag or box. Some modern vehicle machine guns used linkless feed systems however.|$|R
2500|$|The Prussians {{and foreign}} {{observers}} were not {{impressed by the}} performance of the mitrailleuse. In the case of the Prussians, their views were undoubtedly colored by propaganda. They had very few machine <b>guns</b> or <b>volley</b> <b>guns</b> of their own and, not least for reasons of maintaining morale {{in the face of a}} new weapon technology, they scorned the effectiveness of the mitrailleuse. They nonetheless saw the weapon as a threat and Prussian artillery always made it a priority to engage and destroy mitrailleuse batteries. The weapon's characteristic [...] "snarling rasp" [...] does appear to have made some impression—the Prussian troops called the mitrailleuse the [...] "Höllenmaschine" [...] ("Hell Machine, Infernal Machine") ...|$|R
50|$|As {{the siege}} {{continued}} Akbar placed even bigger cannons and high velocity mortars {{on the two}} rocky outcrops facing Ranthambore Fort. Akbar also ordered his men to begin constructing sabats, or covered ways, {{in order to allow}} the army to move nearer to the enemy. Within weeks the sabats allow Akbar's men to gain control of territories just underneath the steep slope of Ranthambore Fort. The Mughals built prefabricated walls to protect their gains around the fort and then placed highly accurate narrow barreled long-cannons that were about 20-25 ft in length. The long-cannons and <b>Volley</b> <b>guns</b> that were effectively utilized during the siege were known to have been designed by the prestigious inventor Fathullah Shirazi.|$|R
50|$|A <b>volley</b> <b>gun</b> is a {{gun with}} several barrels for firing {{a number of}} shots, either {{simultaneously}} or in succession. They differ from modern machine guns in that they lack automatic loading and automatic fire and are limited {{by the number of}} barrels bundled together.|$|E
50|$|The <b>volley</b> <b>gun</b> {{consisted}} of seven barrels welded together, with small vents drilled through {{from the central}} barrel to the other six barrels clustered around it. The central barrel screwed onto a hollow spigot which formed the chamber and {{was connected to the}} vent.|$|E
50|$|In June 1835, Giuseppe Marco Fieschi used a home-made, 25-barrel <b>volley</b> <b>gun</b> {{to attempt}} the {{assassination}} of King Louis Philippe I in Paris. He fired the weapon from a third floor window while the king and his entourage were passing in the street below. Although 18 people were killed, the king only received a minor wound. The gun barrels had been sold as scrap by a government arsenal after being labeled as defective and four of them burst when fired. Fieschi was badly injured and was quickly captured. He and two others involved in the plot were condemned to death and guillotined in 1836. His <b>volley</b> <b>gun,</b> known as the Machine infernale, is preserved at the Museum of French History.|$|E

50|$|After {{the failed}} {{infantry}} assaults, Gilmore decided to attack Fort Wagner by regular approaches using saps and parallels. On July 19, 1863, the first parallel was dug near the pre-existing Federal lines. Saps were driven forward {{and a second}} parallel was established by July 23. The second parallel contained batteries directed against both Fort Wagner and Fort Sumter. The Atlantic Ocean flank of the second parallel was anchored by “Surf Battery” built below the high tide line. The “Surf Battery” was armed with field howitzers and Requa <b>volley</b> <b>guns</b> (proto-machine guns capable of firing 175 rounds per minute) to defend the Federal trenches from Confederates sorties up the beach. Coehorn, 8-inch, and 10-inch mortars were used by the Federal troops as their trenches approached Fort Wagner and field artillery {{was placed in the}} trenches to defend against possible Confederate sorties.|$|R
50|$|Bowie did not brandish a seven-barrelled <b>volley</b> Nock <b>gun,</b> {{nor was he}} {{wounded in}} the leg during the final assault, nor did his wife die {{during the time of}} the siege; he fell ill due to typhoid fever and was barely awake during the final attack, and Bowie's wife died two and a half years before the battle was fought.|$|R
50|$|The Ribauldequin was {{a medieval}} {{version of the}} <b>volley</b> <b>gun.</b> It had its barrels set up in parallel. This early version was first {{employed}} during the Hundred Years' War by the army of Edward III of England, in 1339. Later on, the late Swiss army employed it.|$|E

5000|$|The Montigny mitrailleuse was {{an early}} type of crank-operated machine-gun {{developed}} by the Belgian gun works of Joseph Montigny between 1859 and 1870.

60|$|After {{one great}} <b>volley</b> of <b>guns</b> against the bastille, we, looking down into our {{boulevard}} of the Pierrefonds Gate, saw the portcullis raised, the drawbridge lowered, {{and a great}} array of men-at-arms carrying ladders rush out, and charge upon the bastille. Then, through the smoke and fire, they strove to scale the works, and for the space of half an hour all was roar of guns; but at length our men came back, leaving many slain, and the running libbards grinned on the flag of England.|$|R
60|$|They {{were not}} {{immediately}} {{in the rear}} of Mr. Hardy, but rather to the left. As Mr. Hardy and his sons turned to fly, a number of Indians sprang upon their feet from among the grass, and discharged a <b>volley</b> of <b>guns</b> and arrows at them. Fortunately the distance was considerable. One of their arrows, however, struck Mr. Hardy's horse in the shoulder, while another stuck in the rider's arm. Another went through the calf of Hubert's leg, and stuck in the flap of the saddle.|$|R
60|$|As {{the rest}} of the blacks leapt to their feet, a <b>volley</b> from {{nineteen}} <b>guns</b> was poured into them--followed by seven or eight more, as most of the settlers were armed with double-barrelled guns; a few buckshot being dropped into each barrel, over the bullets. Then came the sharp cracks of the pistols, as the whites rushed down to the assault.|$|R
