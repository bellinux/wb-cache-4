40|$|In 1995, a National Health Insurance Law (NHIL) {{was enacted}} in Israel. It {{specified}} a mandatory package {{of services to}} be provided by the four competing private non-profit sickness funds, and secured the financing of that provision. This review discusses the main issues associated with financing of - and the sickness funds' expenditure on - the package of services and analyzes the trends during {{the first decade of}} the implementation of the NHIL. The main findings indicate that between 1995 and 2005 the "real value" of the budget of the package of services has eroded by more than a third, most of it being due to the under-updating with regard to technological advances. The steep rise in the co-payment paid by users of health services and in <b>voluntary</b> <b>supplementary</b> health insurance ownership which is offered by the sickness funds partially financed that erosion. The growth of private spending on health, including on <b>voluntary</b> <b>supplementary</b> insurance, took place in all population groups and in the lowest income-quintile in particular. Indices of the progressivity of the financing of the package of services indicate that the burden of financing has been slightly regressive. In spite of the increase in the share of the regressive private expenditure between 1997 and 2003, overall, the finance became less regressive due to the health tax becoming less regressive. In conclusion, the introduction of the Israeli NHIL was a promising social achievement, but, during its first decade and facing tight national budgets and receiving lower national priority, subsequent regulation eroded the real value of its benefits, and its principles of solidarity and equity in finance. After 10 years of experience, the system might need refreshment and policy amendments that will correspond to its original aspirations. ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{countries}} are considering {{the option of}} reducing the share of mandatory health insurance (MHI) and to increasingly rely on <b>voluntary</b> (<b>supplementary)</b> health insurance (VHI) schemes to cover health care expenditures. It is well-known that competitive markets for VHI tend to risk-rated premiums. After discussing the determinants of riskrating in competitive VHI markets, we provide empirical evidence of the potential reduction of (risk-) solidarity caused by the transfer of benefits from MHI to VHI coverage. For this purpose, we simulate several scenarios in which benefits covered by MHI are transferred to competitive markets for VHI. We use a dataset issued by the largest insurer in the Netherlands, in order to calculate the potential premium range for VHI resulting from this transfer. Our findings show that, by adding risk-factors, the minimum VHI premium decreases while the maximum increases. Moreover, we observe that risk-rating primarily affects the maximum premium. The reduction of solid arity is especially substantial for benefits such as medical devices and drugs. Finally we discuss some options to maintain a socially acceptable level of solidarity in VHI markets. solidarity, competition, risk-rating, supplementary health insurance, risk-adjustment. ...|$|R
40|$|Like {{many other}} countries, the Netherlands has a health {{insurance}} system that combines mandatory basic insurance with <b>voluntary</b> <b>supplementary</b> insurance. Both types of insurance are founded on different principles. Since basic and supplementary insurance are {{sold by the}} same health insurers, both markets may interact.

Our analysis is based on an investigation into supplementary health insurance contracts, underwriting procedures and annual surveys among 1, 700 - 2, 100 respondents over the period 2006 - 2009. We find that health insurers increasingly use a variety of strategies to enforce a joint purchase of basic and supplementary health insurance. Despite incentives for health insurers to use supplementary insurance as a tool for risk selection in basic insurance, we find limited evidence of supplementary insurance being used this way. Only a minority of health insurers uses health questionnaires when people apply for supplementary coverage. Nevertheless, we find that an increasing proportion of high-risk individuals believe that insurers would not be willing to offer them another supplementary insurance contract. We discuss several strategies to prevent or to counteract the observed negative spillover effects of supplementary insurance...|$|R

For this reason, {{reductions}} {{in the level of}} public pensions were adopted under the pension reform in 2001, which also strengthened significantly the funded second and third pillars of old-age provision. The introduction of the supplementary pension provision brings with itself two major risks we are going to analyse in the present paper. One risk is implied by the voluntariness of supplementary arrangements. There is uncertainty over whether households � in particular the less affluent ones � will show the willingness and/or the capability to accumulate supplementary savings for their old age consistently. A further risk for supplementary old-age provision - which could as well be seen as a chance � rests in the return on contributions. Critics of funded private retirement provision often point at the return risk, in particular {{against the backdrop of the}} recent developments on capital markets. This paper asks whether under these risks, households will be able to close the gap arising from a reduction of public pension levels and to which degree there is scope for temporary suspensions of contributions to <b>supplementary</b> <b>schemes.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{reports a}} {{comprehensive study of}} <b>supplementary</b> control <b>schemes</b> for HVDC inter‐ties parallel to AC transmission lines {{in order to reduce}} electromechanical inter‐area oscillations employing a suitable two‐area power system. The study includes design procedure and an extensive analysis based upon time domain detailed simulations, developed using PSCAD/EMTDC. Results obtained from two‐area power system show how the control over the HVDC inter‐tie effectively reduces the electromechanical inter‐are oscillations. The supplementary outer control loop of the HVDC link, suitably designed, permits to increase the damping ratio of the system to a safe value, which can not be attained solely using power system stabilizers. Power modulation through the HVDC link effectively reduces electromechanical inter‐area oscillations under a wide range of composite static load characteristics. Response is however limited by the value of the voltage index for active power; the compensation loop is functional only when this index is greater than one. The effectiveness of the <b>supplementary</b> control <b>scheme</b> is barely affected by the value of the voltage index for reactive power; these results reduce the modeling considerations of the reactive power characteristics, which in practical circumstances are more variable and depending on several and sometimes unknown factors...|$|R
40|$|With {{more and}} more {{renewable}} energy generation (REG) connections, busbar voltage violation and line overloading problems may occur for some parts of a distribution network. However, building new circuits to accommodate REG may have high monetary and environmental costs. This paper considers distribution automation as a <b>supplementary</b> <b>scheme</b> to traditional primary asset investments and analyzes the operational benefits from introducing an autonomous regional active network management system (AuRA-NMS) to a practical distribution system with rich renewable sources. The benefits are quantified in terms of optimal power flow control and investment deferral, and the resulting quantification will inform distribution network operators of the trade-offs between investment in the automation system and in the primary assets, thus helping them to make cost-effective investment decisions. Time-series-based simulation for over an entire year is implemented to calculate the benefits of active power loss and curtailment reductions for AuRA-NMS over the current practice. Part I of this paper illustrates the current schemes for voltage control and constraint management, advanced voltage control and constraint management enabled by the distribution automation, and the annual benefit by introducing the AuRA-NMS to the system with different considerable new DG integrations.

To achieve best performance, parameters of the damping control are tuned by using a genetic algorithm. Results of eigenvalue analysis and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of supplementary damping control with fixed wind speed.

These data show that, in the first 3 years fo 7 lowing the inception of Medicare, use of hospital services by the agedmeasured by days of care per 1 ~ 000 personsincreased at an average annual rate of 6 - 13 percent. Since 1969, however, hospital utilization by this age group has been declining l- 3 percent annually, mostly as a result of a decline in average length of stay. Comparison with similar data for persons under age 65 reveals that a significant redistribution of hospital care between this age group and those aged 65 and over has occurred since 1965. It is likely that aged persons increased their use of hospital services to some extent at the expense of persons under age 65. ~ MEDICARE’s two coordinated programs of health insurance for the aged-a basic hospital insurance program (HI) and a <b>voluntary</b> <b>supplementary</b> medical insurance program (SMI) -went into effect on July 1, 1966.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the meanings and the problems of Reformed Pension Scheme in Sweden by making clear the features of the present pension systems. The present Swedish pension systems - the National Basic Pension and the National <b>Supplementary</b> Pension <b>Scheme</b> - were established a generation ago with the introduction of the <b>Supplementary</b> Pension <b>Scheme</b> in 1960. The pluralistic dynamism has brought the present pension systems in Sweden into the instability, the inequity, the distortion and the dualism. In 1990 the Commission presented the findings and proposals of the systems. Many considered that more far-reaching changes were necessary than those proposed by the Commission. The Working Group on Pension was therefor set up. In 1994, the bill containing guidelines for the reformed system was submitted to the Swedish Parliament. Parliament decided that these guidelines should form the basis for future reform. The features of the pension reform in Sweden have been formulated in following way: it is worthy of special mention to resume the contribution-payment of the employees and to take away financial difficulties by introducing the lifetime earning principle, the income index adjustment, the defined contribution scheme, and the coefficient of the average life expectancy. In this sense Sweden can obtain excellent results of the pension reform in 1998. But instead of the contribution-payment of the employees, the Swedish neo-corporatism guaranteed a wage increase, and can't lighten the burden of the employers.
