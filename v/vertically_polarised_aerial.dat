Compared to previous work reported in the literature, the antenna provides increased gain suppression to <b>vertically</b> <b>polarised</b> signals within the notch-band of up to 41. 5 dB in four specific directions.

An associated dispersion relation is derived and the frequencies and eigenfunctions of the wave modes are characterised. Results. For some equilibria, the waves are shown to be all damped due to lateral leakage. It is demonstrated that waves either leak straight out into the external medium or have to overcome an evanescent barrier, which is linked to wave tunneling. The wave solutions consist of alternating <b>vertically</b> <b>polarised</b> kink and sausage branches. Fast kink oscillations may have a non-zero density perturbation when averaged across the loop.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{nonlinear}} elastic pre-stress on coupled compressional and <b>vertically</b> <b>polarised</b> shear elastic wave propagation in a two-dimensional periodic structure is investigated. The medium consists of cylindrical annuli embedded on a periodic lattice {{in a uniform}} host material. An identical inhomogeneous deformation is imposed in each annulus and the theory of small-on-large is used to find the incremental wave equations governing subsequent small-amplitude elastic waves. The plane-wave-expansion method is employed {{in order to determine}} the permissable eigenfrequencies. It is found that the application of pre-stress has a significant effect on the band structure, allowing stop bands to be controlled. The sensitivity of the choice of constitutive behaviour is studied and it is shown that the fundamental shear wave mode is largely unchanged for the class of strain energy functions considered here, whereas the compressional mode is considerably more sensitive to this choice...|$|R

With increasing frequencies, modelling these traces as electrically short no longer suffices. Accurate long line models exist, but are too complicated to easily induce the worst case. Therefore, we need a simple analytical model. In this article, we predict the terminal voltages of an electrically long, two-wire transmission line with characteristic loads in vacuum, excited by a linearly polarised plane wave. The model consists of a short line model (one Taylor cell) with an intuitive correction factor for long line effects: the modified Taylor cell.
