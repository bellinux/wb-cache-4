40|$|Cloud {{security}} {{is one of}} the biggest concerns for many companies. The growth in the number and size of websites increases the need for better securing those websites. Manual testing and detection of web vulnerabilities can be very time consuming. Automated Web <b>Vulnerability</b> <b>Scanners</b> (WVS) help with the detection of vulnerabilities in web applications. Acunetix {{is one of the}} widely used <b>vulnerability</b> <b>scanners.</b> Acunetix is also easy to implement and to use. The scan results not only provide the details of the vulnerabilities, but also give information about fixing the vulnerabilities. AcuSensor and AcuMonitor (technologies used by Acunetix) help generate more accurate potential vulnerability results. One of the purposes of this paper is to orient current students of computer security with using <b>vulnerability</b> <b>scanners.</b> Secondly, this paper provides a literature review related to the topic of security <b>vulnerability</b> <b>scanners.</b> Finally, web <b>vulnerabilities</b> are addressed from the mobile device and browser perspectives...|$|R

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} web <b>vulnerability</b> <b>scanners</b> {{and the differences}} in the functionality provided by these tool-based vulnerability detection approaches increase the demand for testing their detection effectiveness. Despite the advantages of dynamic testing approaches, the literature lacks studies that systematically evaluate the performance of open source web <b>vulnerability</b> <b>scanners.</b> The main objectives of this study are to assess the performance of open source scanners from multiple perspectives and to examine their detection capability. This paper presents the results of a comparative evaluation of the security features as well as the performance of four web vulnerability detection tools. We followed this comparative assessment with a case study in which we evaluate the level of agreement between the results reported by two open source web <b>vulnerability</b> <b>scanners.</b> Given that the results of our comparative evaluation did not show significant performance differences among the scanners while the results of the conducted case study revealed high level of disagreement between the reports generated by different scanners, we conclude that the inconsistencies between the reports generated by different scanners might not necessarily correlate with their performance properties. We also present some recommendations for helping developers of web <b>vulnerabilities</b> <b>scanners</b> to improve their tools’ capabilities...|$|R
30|$|The OPS Logic module {{controls}} {{the processes of}} the OPS. It configures the security scanners, boots the virtual machines to test (if required) and starts the actual scans. Since the <b>vulnerability</b> <b>scanners</b> are basically third-party products with individual characteristics and modes of operation, they are abstracted by Adapters that hide the differences and provide an unified interface to start and monitor the <b>vulnerability</b> <b>scanners.</b> They allow the OPS not only to start the actual scans, but also to watch the scanners during the execution to detect any failures and react accordingly.|$|R

50|$|Previously unknown {{vulnerabilities}} can {{be discovered}} through penetration testing or via a <b>vulnerability</b> <b>scanner.</b> A web application <b>vulnerability</b> <b>scanner,</b> {{also known as}} a web application security scanner, is defined in the SAMATE NIST 500-269 as “an automated program that examines web applications for potential security vulnerabilities. In addition to searching for web application-specific vulnerabilities, the tools also look for software coding errors.” Resolving vulnerabilities is commonly referred to as remediation. Corrections to the code can be made in the application but typically a more prompt response is necessary. In these situations, the application of a custom policy for a unique web application vulnerability to provide a temporary but immediate fix (known as a virtual patch) may be necessary.|$|E
50|$|According to surveys done in 2009 by sectools.org, Nessus is the world's {{most popular}} <b>vulnerability</b> <b>scanner,</b> taking {{first place in}} the 2000, 2003, and 2006 {{security}} tools survey.
