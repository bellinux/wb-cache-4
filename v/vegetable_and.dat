5|$|Encarsia formosa {{is a small}} predatory {{chalcid wasp}} which is a {{parasitoid}} of whitefly, a sap-feeding insect which can cause wilting and black sooty moulds in glasshouse <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> ornamental crops. It is most effective when dealing with low level infestations, giving protection {{over a long period}} of time. The wasp lays its eggs in young whitefly 'scales', turning them black as the parasite larvae pupate. Gonatocerus ashmeadi (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) has been introduced to control the glassy-winged sharpshooter Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in French Polynesia and has successfully controlled ~95% of the pest density.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Participation {{in global}} trade means that China’s <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruits {{industry}} faces international food safety standards and increased scrutiny worldwide. The objectives {{of this paper}} were to investigate how existing food safety standards and regulations in the importing countries impact the export of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruits from China. This paper discussed the current and historical situations of China’s <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruits export from 1996 to 2010, analyzed the Maximum Residual Limit (MRL) standards of pesticides imposed by importing countries, quantitatively estimated the impacts of food safety standards on China’s <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruits export based on a gravity model. The results showed that although transportation distance between trade partners and tariff rates on <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruits were still the importantly resistant factors for China export, <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruits export was sensitive {{to the number of}} regulated pesticides, the strictness, and the level of food safety standards imposed by importing countries, which showed a significant trade flow effect, stricter food safety standards, increased number of regulated pesticides significantly inhibit China export of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruits. Moreover, China’s food safety standards also showed a significantly effect on <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruits export, which inhibited export to some extent...|$|R
40|$|A {{dissertation}} on <b>Vegetables</b> <b>and</b> Fruits Consumption Campaign and Sales for Sustainable Economic Development of Vendors in Chamazi Market {{is a result}} of the Community Needs Assessments (CNA) conducted in Chamazi Market to vendors <b>and</b> consumers of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruits. The CNA revealed that <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruits consumption is very low to majority of residents in Chamazi. This situation has affected vendors of the products since they cannot generate high income to suffice their livelihood. There are a number of factors that contribute for low intake of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruits among Chamazi residents including; lack of nutrition education on the importance of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruits, low income that affects purchasing power and unavailability of different varieties of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruits in Chamazi market. Consequently a number of factors that contribute to low sales among vendors are such as lack of entrepreneurial skills, poor marketing skill, poor working environment (market space) l lack of capital, unreliable market for some varieties which are not common in Chamazi market and poor technology i. e. lacks of preservative facilities (cold rooms) since <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruits are more perishable products. However, <b>Vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruits selling is a very good and reliable business if it is done with expertise following the potential nutrients found for human health. Every individual and household requires to consume <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruits whether they like or not for their better health. Vendors should cultivate on this positive point of nutrition benefits of <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruits plus marketing skills to ensure high income through high sales. To achieve the project objectives, a participatory approach are necessary to be able to increase awareness to communities about the project equally nutrition education and consumption campaigns are continuously inevitable. In this view, stakeholders and policy makers are to be involved for project sustainability and up-scaling. The expected outcome is increased <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruits consumption resulting to increased sales for sustainable income generation to vendors in general...|$|R

5|$|Grasshoppers eat large {{quantities}} of foliage both as adults and during their development, and can be serious pests of arid land and prairies. Pasture, grain, forage, <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> other crops can be affected. Grasshoppers often bask in the sun, and thrive in warm sunny conditions, so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper populations. A single season of drought is not normally sufficient to stimulate a massive population increase, but several successive dry seasons can do so, especially if the intervening winters are mild so {{that large numbers of}} nymphs survive. Although sunny weather stimulates growth, there needs to be an adequate food supply for the increasing grasshopper population. This means that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth, prolonged periods of cloudy weather will slow nymphal development.|$|E

Nearly all those with heads are oriented {{head up and}} are either seen face on or in profile to the right, {{in the direction of}} writing. It is not known what significance turning a glyph head-down or to the left may have had. Heads often have characteristic projections on the sides which may be eyes (as on the sea turtle glyph below, and more clearly on sea-turtle petroglyphs) but which often resemble ears (as on the anthropomorphic petroglyph in the next section). Birds are common; many resemble the frigatebird (see image directly below) which was associated with the supreme god Makemake. Other glyphs look like fish or arthropods. A few are similar to petroglyphs found throughout the island.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} takes both <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> animal food, {{and is more}} {{carnivorous}} than most small rodents are; dominant food items vary seasonally. Plants eaten include species of Spartina, Salicornia, Tripsacum, and Elymus, among others; it mainly eats seeds and succulent parts. It prefers Spartina alterniflora that has been fertilized with nitrogen and mainly eats the inner tissue of the stem, perhaps because nitrogen-fertilized plants contain much less dimethylsulfoniopropionate in their inner tissues. The marsh rice rat was a major pest on rice plantations, feeding on the rice when it was newly planted. It also eats the fungus Endogone at times.|$|E

5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E
5|$|In this {{situation}} one Ivaylo, {{a native of}} north-eastern Bulgaria, most likely the area near Provadia, began to incite the population to revolt. He was called by the contemporary Byzantine chroniclers by the name Bardokva (lettuce) or Lakhanas (<b>vegetable)</b> <b>and</b> his real name is known only from a note, attached to the Svarlig gospel. The Byzantine historian George Pachymeres stated {{that he was a}} swineherd who took care of pigs for money. However, the historian John Fine notes that pigs were a major livestock product at the time and the possessor of a large herd could {{have been part of the}} elite of the local community. Ivaylo claimed that he had visions from God to lead the people and that he was in contact with heaven and the saints. In fact, his mysticism was deliberately used to swiftly gain support and followers among the religious villagers. He came to be seen by many Bulgarians as a God-given saviour.|$|E
5|$|The camas {{pocket gopher}} (Thomomys bulbivorus), {{also known as}} the camas rat or Willamette Valley gopher, is a rodent, the largest member in the genus Thomomys, of the family Geomyidae. First {{described}} in , it is endemic to the Willamette Valley of northwestern Oregon in the United States. The herbivorous gopher forages for <b>vegetable</b> <b>and</b> plant matter, which it collects in large, fur-lined, external cheek pouches. Surplus food is hoarded in an extensive system of underground tunnels. The dull-brown-to-lead-gray coat changes color and texture over the year. The mammal's characteristically large, protuberant incisors are well adapted for use in tunnel construction, particularly in the hard clay soils of the Willamette Valley. The gophers make chattering sounds with their teeth; males and females make purring (or crooning) sounds when they are together, and the young make twittering sounds. Born toothless, blind and hairless, the young grow rapidly before being weaned at about six weeks of age.|$|E
40|$|Background: Food fussiness (FF) {{is common}} in early {{childhood}} and {{is often associated with}} the rejection of nutrient-dense foods such as <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruit. FF <b>and</b> liking for <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruit are likely all heritable phenotypes; the genetic influence underlying FF may explain the observed genetic influence on liking for <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruit. Twin analyses make it possible to get a broad-based estimate of the extent of the shared genetic influence that underlies these traits. Objective: We quantified the extent of the shared genetic influence that underlies FF <b>and</b> liking for <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruit in early childhood {{with the use of a}} twin design. Design: Data were from the Gemini cohort, which is a populationbased sample of twins born in England and Wales in 2007. Parents of 3 -y-old twins (n = 1330 pairs) completed questionnaire measures of their children's food preferences (liking for <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruit) and the FF scale from the Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Multivariate quantitative genetic modeling was used to estimate common genetic influences that underlie FF <b>and</b> liking for <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruit. Results: Genetic correlations were significant and moderate to large in size between FF and liking for both <b>vegetables</b> (20. 65) <b>and</b> fruit (20. 43), which indicated that a substantial proportion of the genes that influence FF also influence liking. Common genes that underlie FF <b>and</b> liking for <b>vegetables</b> <b>and</b> fruit largely explained the observed phenotypic correlations between them (68 - 70 %). Conclusions: FF and liking for fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> in young children share a large proportion of common genetic factors. The genetic influence on FF may determine why fussy children typically reject fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetables...</b>|$|R
