40|$|Solar {{thermal energy}} {{collection}} at seven sites is calculated for air and vacuum flat plate collectors and a <b>vacuum</b> <b>collector</b> using cylindrical Winston concentration. The hourly intensity and angular distribution of solar radiation is predicted for the calcula-tions using insolation measurements and an insolation model. Tracking configurations include two-axis, vertical axis, polar axis and east-west axis tracking. Fixed collector arrays are all tilted towards the equator at the latitude angle. These calculations indicate energy collection varies linearly with cloudiness index KT. Diffuse radiation is a 15 % of energy collected by concentrating collector arrays at low operating temperatures where large acceptance angles maximize energy collection. Smaller acceptance angles, required to maximize collection at higher operating temperatures, eliminate {{the advantage of}} Winston concentration for tracking arrays. Absorbers with high selectivity are neces-sary for high efficiency of fixed evacuated collectors at higher operating temperatures. Ratios of tracking to fixed collector energy collection increase rapidly between a 200 °C and a 300 °C making it likely that tracking becomes economically viable in this temperature range.
