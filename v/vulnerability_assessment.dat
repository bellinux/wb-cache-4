5|$|The Murrah Federal Building {{had been}} {{considered}} so safe that it only employed one security guard. In June 1995, the DOJ issued <b>Vulnerability</b> <b>Assessment</b> of Federal Facilities, also known as The Marshals Report, the findings of {{which resulted in a}} thorough evaluation of security at all federal buildings and a system for classifying risks at over 1,300federal facilities owned or leased by the federal government. Federal sites were divided into five security levels ranging from Level 1 (minimum security needs) to Level 5 (maximum). The Alfred P. Murrah Building was deemed a Level 4 building. Among the 52security improvements were physical barriers, closed-circuit television monitoring, site planning and access, hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance, glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards and fatalities, and structural engineering design to prevent progressive collapse.|$|E

These are national defense, foreign affairs, intelligence, and law enforcement. Each lead agency for these special functions appoints a senior official {{to serve as a}} functional coordinator for the federal government. In 2008 a mobile PDA-based <b>Vulnerability</b> <b>Assessment</b> Security Survey Tool (VASST) was introduced to speed physical security assessment of critical infrastructure by law enforcement to meet compliance requirements of PDD-63.|$|E
30|$|To help {{address the}} caveats {{outlined}} above, {{and to provide}} structured and guided access to the fragmented and scattered knowledge on <b>vulnerability</b> and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>assessments</b> for newcomers in the field, as well as practitioners and researchers from other fields, a web-based, interactive knowledge platform, VuWiki (www.vuwiki.org), has been developed {{as a framework for}} the description of <b>vulnerability</b> <b>assessments.</b> It allows for the structured storage and retrieval of information by annotation of key categories and properties of <b>vulnerability.</b> Hence, <b>vulnerability</b> <b>assessments</b> are comparable and easily accessible at a glance. When developing the ontology and VuWiki, the aim therefore explicitly was not to “synthesize” a holistic or overarching model for <b>vulnerability</b> <b>assessments</b> or to derive an integrated vulnerability framework.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSpatial <b>vulnerability</b> <b>assessments</b> are {{frequently}} used methods {{to facilitate the}} preparation of emergency plans. Most <b>assessments</b> consider <b>vulnerabilities</b> from a static point of view. However, some emergencies like power outages require dynamic pre-planning and response. Dynamic approaches are requested since consequences of power outages depend mainly on the duration, the day time, and coping capacities that are available in affected facilities.

30|$|A {{successful}} implementation of disaster risk reduction options and strategies demands appropriate mechanisms to communicate and transfer the overall knowledge on risk and its underlying drivers to the various stakeholders involved in the decision-making process. <b>Vulnerability</b> <b>assessments</b> {{are the product of}} the state-of-the-art in science and integrate large volumes of data and sophisticated analysis. However, as the knowledge and the volume of scientific works on <b>vulnerability</b> <b>assessments</b> multiply steadily, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the practice and science community to keep track of all these developments effectively and to use it towards disaster risk reduction. Consequently, the main intention of making <b>vulnerability</b> <b>assessments</b> comparable by using a practical and structured access to the existing, complex, and growing knowledge field is to foster exchange of knowledge, as well as learning among disciplines. VuWiki can serve as a knowledge management tool for a broad research and practice community and, in this capacity, contribute to interactions between science and practice in terms of knowledge transfer. VuWiki also comprises the potential to bridge the “implementation gap” by serving as an interactive platform that helps sort through and convey the relevant knowledge for a specific context so that the knowledge is used and put into practice. For example, a national authority that may want to develop new guidelines for community flood risk management based on risk and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>assessments</b> can use the features in VuWiki such as wiki drilldown (see Sect. 4.3) to get an overview of the relevant parameters for flood vulnerability at the community scale of assessment and be able to discern which of the many studies are the most applicable to their particular needs. It {{should be noted that the}} usefulness of VuWiki in this regard is dependent on community involvement criteria, and the depth and extent to which the wiki is populated with additional <b>vulnerability</b> <b>assessments</b> beyond those currently represented. Second, VuWiki is “just” a tool that provides access to knowledge in a structured way. Due to copyright reasons, data licensing, and other legal limitations, it cannot provide the actual journal articles itself.|$|R
