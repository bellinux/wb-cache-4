In practice, the magnitude of the <b>voltage</b> <b>surges</b> is usually limited using the surge arresters while the rise time of the surge to which the apparatus is exposed, remains unchanged. In this paper, the characteristic of the switching transients generated in the MV cable grids are analyzed. For this purpose, cases with both dry-type and oil insulated transformers are studied. These cases are typical for a MV industrial grid and a wind park (WP) collection grid. Furthermore, the case with and without surge arrester protection is analyzed in order to observe the impact of the surge arresters on the <b>voltage</b> <b>surges.</b> Simulations show that the magnitude of the <b>voltage</b> <b>surges</b> exceeds the basic lightning impulse insulation level (BIL) defined by present standards. Furthermore, the rise time of the <b>voltage</b> <b>surges</b> is much shorter compared to the rise time of the lightning impulse {{especially in the case of}} the dry-type transformers and the WP collection grid. When surge arresters are used, the magnitude of the surges is limited to the BIL but the rise times of the surges can be twenty five times shorter compared to the BIL.

These devices are commonly used for telephone lines as they enter a building; the spark gaps help protect the building and internal telephone circuits {{from the effects of}} lightning strikes. Less sophisticated (and much less expensive) spark gaps are made using modified ceramic capacitors; in these devices, the spark gap is simply an air gap sawn between the two lead wires that connect the capacitor to the circuit. A <b>voltage</b> <b>surge</b> causes a spark that jumps from lead wire to lead wire across the gap left by the sawing process.

50|$|Close {{proximity}} strikes {{by lightning}} will always {{set off the}} ground fault circuit and at times blow the system out if the system did not follow NEC code Art. 250.94 which illustrates how {{to get rid of}} grounding differentials. A good ground filter/notch filter will prevent a feedback loop up case ground which causes false alarms. Also surge suppression improperly installed inside a fire alarm panel will also cause a feedback loop up case ground and cause false alarms. So the surge suppression must be outside the box, in a plastic box and not grounded directly to the fire panel, rather the grounded to the ground side/line side of the in-line series three stage two tank circuit designed AC surge suppression. Parallel will not protect a fire alarm panel nor prevent false alarms. In series surge suppression will at least help one control where the surges are coming from and the ground filter will also help. Tie three to four knots in the low voltage wire between the low <b>voltage</b> <b>surge</b> suppress and the fire alarm panel, and tie at least one knot in the phase/neutral/and ground wire attached to the power supply. This will help mitigate false alarms, as well as help one's surge suppression do a better job.|$|E
