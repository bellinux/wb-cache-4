500|$|Retrospective critiques {{continue}} {{to praise the}} game's narrative and degree of choice. In 2009, an article in Rock, Paper, Shotgun declared: [...] "The sense of sorrow comes from the realisation that there's nothing like [...] on the horizon... why should there be so few games like this? Oh right, because it's so <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do...</b> the lack of games comparable to Bloodlines {{is one of the}} great tragedies of our time." [...] Eurogamer called the game inspirational, with an unmatched level of narrative detail. In 2010, The Escapist called Bloodlines a flawed masterpiece which could have been a genuine masterpiece with more time, money and staff; although great games may inspire awe, it instead created a devoted fan base which continued to develop the game. Bloodlines is considered a cult classic.|$|E

[...] She said that the video [...] " [...] very much about [...] giving almost a physical experience of {{what it feels like}} to be on a dance floor or fall in love, whether it's blood or endorphins or other body fluids." [...] She wanted to make a video about sex, but said that [...] "in a way that wasn't so clichéd. [...] And [...] is made to give you a picture of what sex really is, which I think is something that's <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> because sex is everywhere all the time, but very rarely is it made out to be something real." [...] The video begins with a reversed scene of a young couple having sex. In cutscenes, Robyn appears with a tube dress with clear liquid flowing through it. When the young woman begins to switch her sex partners, the liquid in the tubes wrapped around Robyn begins to alter colors and flow more quickly. The video ends with Robyn standing alone with black liquid in the tubes.|$|E

In this report I give (i) a brief overview of the simulation problems to be faced in astrophysics and cosmology, with particular emphasis on the classic gravitational N-body problem and (ii) some results on the evolution of a typical example of intermediate N-body system, like a globular cluster moving in an external galactic field. © 2005 Elsevier B.

2500|$|Dilbert's {{anthropomorphic}} pet dog is {{the smartest}} dog on Earth. Dogbert is a megalomaniac intellectual dog, planning {{to one day}} conquer the world. He once succeeded, but became bored with the ensuing peace, and quit. Often seen in high-ranking consultant or technical support jobs, he constantly abuses his power and fools the management of Dilbert's company, though considering the intelligence of the company's management in general and Dilbert's boss in particular, this is not <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> He also enjoys pulling scams on unsuspecting and usually dull customers to steal their money. [...] However, despite Dogbert's cynical exterior, he {{has been known to}} pull his master out of some tight jams. Dogbert's nature as a pet was more emphasized during the earlier years of the strip; as the strip progressed, references to his acting like a dog became less common, although he still wags his tail when he perpetrates his scams. When an older Dilbert arrives while time-traveling from the future, he refers to Dogbert as [...] "majesty", indicating that Dogbert will one day indeed rule the world...again, and make worshipping him retroactive so he could boss around time travelers.|$|E

He also commented {{that it had been}} more collaborative than their prior album; bassist Arion Salazar became more involved in the writing and production, while drummer Brad Hargreaves was involved in the creative process for the first time, as he had joined the band late into their sessions for the first album. However, in retrospect, Jenkins painted a much more grim picture, citing time constraints, label pressure from Elektra Records, and isolation between members, stating: [...] "We did the last album in six months, we just whipped it out, and there's some things on that album, on the second album, that I'm so proud of...but the second album suffered from a kind of coldness almost. That's done in part because we were never in the studio at the same time, never rehearsed the songs together, never played them together. I did my best to, to produce that record and it was <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Then we succumbed to the time pressures from Elektra to get the album out in six months which we did." ...|$|E

Unfortunately, finding an accurate conserved structure is a <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> task <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Within the present study, the prediction problem is considered as a multiobjective optimization process in which the structural conservation and the sensitivity of the multiple alignment are optimized. The proposed method called GRASPMORSA is based on an aggregate function and GRASP procedure. The initial solutions are obtained by using a random progressive local/ global algorithm, and then they are refined by an iterative realignment. Experiments within a large scale of data have shown the efficacy and effectiveness of the proposed method and its capacity to reach good quality solutions...|$|R

Shortly after, he {{was drawn}} by lot as a militiaman; and {{according}} to the law of that time (for this was in 1807, during the very height of the wars against Napoleon) he must either serve in person or else pay heavily to secure a substitute. George chose regretfully the latter course--the only one open to him if he wished still to support his parents and his infant son. But in order <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, he had to pay away the whole remainder of his carefully hoarded savings, and even to borrow 6 pounds to make up the payment for the substitute. It must have seemed <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, and many men would have sunk under the blow, become hopeless, or taken to careless rowdy drinking habits. George Stephenson felt it bitterly, and gave way for a while to a natural despondency; he would hardly have been human if he had not; but still, he lived over it, and in the end worked on again with fuller resolution and vigour than ever.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{nonlinear}} {{differential equation}} {{in the field}} of heat transfer has been investigated and solved completely by a new method that we called it Akbari-Ganji’s Method (AGM).

This issue will be appeared after comparing the obtained solution by Numerical Method or the Exact Solution. Based on the comparison which has been made between the achieved solutions by AGM and Numerical Method (Runge-Kutte 4 th), it is possible to indicate that AGM can be successfully applied to various differential equations particularly for difficult ones. Furthermore, It is necessary to mention that a summary of the excellence of this method in comparison with other approaches can be considered as follows: Boundary conditions are required in accordance with order of the differential equation, this approach can create additional new boundary conditions in regard to the own differential equation and its derivatives. Therefore, it is logical to mention which AGM is operational for miscellaneous nonlinear differential equations in comparison with the other methods...|$|R
