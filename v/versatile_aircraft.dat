25|$|On 10 May 2013, the B.C. provincial {{government}} {{announced that the}} Hawaii Mars {{would no longer be}} placed on contract after the 2013 season, due to not having been used to fight any B.C. fires for two years and the operation of newer and more <b>versatile</b> <b>aircraft</b> by the Coulson group including a Lockheed C-130 Hercules converted to firefighting use. Although Coulson stated that the Hawaii Mars has been under numerous recent upgrades to make it safer and more reliable, no buyers have come forward to purchase the aircraft. Coulson also cautioned against any plans to open the aircraft as a tourist attraction because of the 2013 closure of the Flying Tankers Bomber Base Museum from poor attendance.|$|E
25|$|The armor on the B-26 {{made it a}} {{particularly}} useful and <b>versatile</b> <b>aircraft</b> for both bombing and counter-insurgency operations. On March 15, 1957, for example, in the Nord-Constantanois area, a force of no less than 12 B-26s was sent to destroy insurgents hiding in the Movis forest. However, one mission flown on July 15, 1959, witnessed the use of napalm. French army paratroopers {{had been brought to}} a standstill by a rebel group near Rafaa, allowing the rebels to control a significant amount of terrain. A B-26 from GB 2/91 took off from Oran, armed with four containers of napalm under the wings. Contact with the army paratroopers proved to be difficult initially, and bad visibility—because it was already dark—did not help when the B-26 flew so low that it clipped some trees only meters away from the paratroopers themselves. Worse {{was the fact that the}} radio became temporarily inoperable. It was up to the pilot himself to release the napalm on his target even if he was flying at high speed and at (very) low altitude. Probably through blind luck, he managed to drop his load without endangering the lives of the paratroopers.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 June 1946, the Vampire was {{introduced}} to the British public when Fighter Command's 247 Squadron was given the honour of leading the flypast over London at the Victory Day Celebrations. The Vampire was a <b>versatile</b> <b>aircraft,</b> setting many aviation firsts and records, being the first RAF fighter with a top speed in excess of [...] On 3 December 1945, a Sea Vampire piloted by Captain Eric [...] "Winkle" [...] Brown became the first pure-jet aircraft to land on and take off from an aircraft carrier.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{aircraft}} {{business in}} Australia produces the Airvan 8, the most capable, rugged and <b>versatile</b> utility <b>aircraft</b> in its class. Certified in 38 countries, over 200 Airvan 8s are in service.|$|R
50|$|AHRLAC was {{launched}} in September 2011 and described by commentators, including The Wall Street Journal, as filling a niche for a <b>versatile,</b> low-cost <b>aircraft.</b> In December 2011, the UK national newspaper The Daily Telegraph reported that the Paramount Group's Wikipedia profile had been edited by accounts linked to Bell Pottinger.|$|R
50|$|The first police {{aviation}} {{department was}} established in New York City in 1919 with two fixed-wing aircraft. Fixed-wing aircraft have generally been replaced by more <b>versatile</b> rotary-wing <b>aircraft</b> since the late 1940s. However, fixed-wing aircraft are still used in some missions, such as border patrol, as their higher speed and greater operating altitude allow larger areas to be covered.|$|R

50|$|While the P-51 Mustang was a <b>versatile</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{used in many}} roles {{during the}} war, its role in European bombing {{missions}} was perhaps its most significant, and several historians and Air Force veterans believe the aircraft gave the Allies a decisive advantage in the European aerial theater.|$|E
50|$|The {{mission of}} VR-54 {{is to provide}} {{worldwide}} 24/7 fleet logistics support to all components of the United States Military. Items transported include vehicles, ammunition, personnel, etc. VR-54 conducts their mission utilizing the Lockheed C-130T Hercules aircraft {{which is one of}} the most <b>versatile</b> <b>aircraft</b> in the United States Navy allowing pilots to take off from practically any surface.|$|E
50|$|The P-4 was not {{designed}} specifically as a passenger aircraft, {{but rather as a}} <b>versatile</b> working <b>aircraft.</b> The aim was to build a robust aircraft with good slow-flying handling, requiring only short takeoff and landing runs and little maintenance. The P-4 HB-AET took off for its maiden flight on 22 March 1948. Series production never went ahead due to capacity bottlenecks.|$|R
50|$|The Bristol Beaufighter, {{based on}} an {{obsolescent}} RAF bomber, became a <b>versatile</b> twin-engine attack <b>aircraft</b> and served in almost every theatre of the war, in the maritime strike and ground attack roles {{as well as that}} of night fighter.|$|R
5000|$|The G-2 Galeb is an <b>versatile</b> trainer <b>aircraft,</b> {{suited for}} {{carrying}} out a varied range of training missions to minimize number of aircraft needed to meet an operator's overall training requirements. The aircraft is flown by a crew of two, typically a candidate pilot and an instructor, which are seated in a tandem cockpit layout, the candidate being typically placed in the forward position; both crew members are provided with Folland Type 1-B lightweight ejector seats.|$|R
50|$|The B-17 was a <b>versatile</b> <b>aircraft,</b> {{serving in}} dozens of USAAF units in theaters of combat {{throughout}} World War II, and in other roles for the RAF. Its main use was in Europe, where its shorter range and smaller bombload relative to other aircraft available did not hamper {{it as much as}} in the Pacific Theater. Peak USAAF inventory (in August 1944) was 4,574 worldwide.|$|E
50|$|OGMA {{participated in}} the initial phase of the product (joint {{definition}} phase) and {{was responsible for the}} development and management of a chain of competitive and flexible supply, mainly based on Portuguese companies. The KC-390 was developed {{for a wide range of}} missions: personnel transport, airdrop of cargo and troops, refueling, medical evacuation and fire fighting. It is the most <b>versatile</b> <b>aircraft</b> in its category associated with the full life cycle of lower market.|$|E
5000|$|This <b>versatile</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{was first}} {{known as the}} Taylor Cub in 1930. Later as the Piper J-3 Cub it became the most {{prolific}} trainer in the world. There were 14,125 civilian built plus 5,703 for military use. The military version was known as [...] "Grasshopper" [...] and had the designation L-4 in the Army Air Corps and NE-1 in the Navy. Beyond basic flight training use the Grasshopper was used for military liaison scouting, coastal patrol and medevac.|$|E
25|$|The Junkers Ju 88 was a German World War II Luftwaffe twin-engined multirole combat aircraft. Junkers Flugzeug- und Motorenwerke (JFM) {{designed}} {{the plane in}} the mid-1930s as a so-called Schnellbomber (fast bomber) {{that would be too}} fast for fighters of its era to intercept. It suffered from a number of technical problems during its development and early operational periods but {{became one of the most}} <b>versatile</b> combat <b>aircraft</b> of the war. Like a number of other Luftwaffe bombers, it served as a bomber, dive bomber, night fighter, torpedo bomber, reconnaissance aircraft, heavy fighter and at the end of the war, as a flying bomb.|$|R
50|$|The Martin 187 Baltimore was a twin-engined light attack bomber {{built by}} the Glenn L. Martin Company in the United States, {{originally}} ordered by the French in May 1940 as a follow-up to the earlier Martin Maryland, then in service in France. With the fall of France, the production series was diverted to Great Britain. Baltimore development was hindered {{by a series of}} problems, although the type eventually became a highly <b>versatile</b> combat <b>aircraft.</b> Produced in large numbers, the Baltimore was not used in combat by the United States forces, but eventually served with the British, Canadian, Australian, South African, Hellenic and the Italian air forces.|$|R
40|$|The {{results are}} {{summarized}} {{of a study}} to develop a <b>versatile</b> research <b>aircraft</b> for flight testing {{a wide variety of}} advanced helicopter and compound rotor systems. The aircraft is required to accept these rotors with minimal changes in the basic vehicle. Rotors envisioned for testing include conventional rotors plus variable geometry, variable twist, variable diameter, coaxial, jet flap, circulation control, and slowed rotors. Various disc loadings would be accommodated. The aircraft must be configured to measure performance more accurately than past test vehicles. In addition, the aircraft would have a wing to off load the rotor while measuring performance during lightly loaded conditions. It would have variable drag and propulsive force so that the rotor can be tested while producing different values of horizontal force...|$|R
50|$|The C-160 {{proved to}} be a <b>versatile</b> <b>aircraft,</b> leading to a long {{operational}} service life. Between its introduction and 1999, approximately 2000 modifications and upgrades were incorporated upon the type, split 60/40 between the structure and equipment respectively. Many changes were made over time in regards to the aircraft's avionics: particular attention was paid in Luftwaffe refurbishments to the navigation and flight control systems, onboard data management computers and radar system, incorporating new features such as GPS and laser inertial navigation systems, modern autopilot and crew management systems, and a greater degree of cockpit integration.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, the 187th {{received}} its first turboprop C-130B Hercules aircraft, {{and became a}} Tactical Airlift Squadron. The C-130 {{has proven to be}} one of the toughest and most <b>versatile</b> <b>aircraft</b> ever built, and which the unit continues to fly over 40 years later. In 1975, the Wyoming Air Guard was selected for the unique role of aerial fire fighting. Two Wyoming C-130s were equipped with Modular Airborne FireFighting System (MAFFS) and began water/fire retardant bombing of fires throughout the United States. Those fire fighting mission still continue through the present.|$|E
50|$|In {{keeping with}} its {{previous}} role when the OCU reformed in December 1951 {{it was to}} train light bomber crews. The aircraft used {{during the rest of}} the unit's operational service was the English Electric Canberra and most operational versions of that <b>versatile</b> <b>aircraft</b> were flown by the unit. It was reformed at RAF Bassingbourn and moved around various stations including RAF Bassingbourn, RAF Cottesmore and RAF Marham during its operational existence. It was redesignated the Canberra Standardisation Training Flight on 15 December 1990, but reverted to 231 OCU on 13 May 1991.|$|E
40|$|Private aerial {{hunting of}} predators for {{protection}} of livestock began before 1925 {{in the western}} United States. Apparently, it was first used in professional control programs in 1942. Inclement weather, dense vegetation and rough terrain are limiting factors and helicopters are more <b>versatile</b> than fixed-wing <b>aircraft.</b> When it can be employed, aerial hunting is unsurpassed as an immediate control method where livestock losses are severe {{and the need for}} control is urgent...|$|R
50|$|The R-33/MiG-31 missile/interceptor {{combination}} {{is similar to}} the earlier Bisnovat R-40/MiG-25 combination, although it is much more versatile and modern in that the MiG-25 was very heavily specialized for the interception of large supersonic targets such as the cancelled North American Aviation XB-70 bomber, and thus lacks maneuverability and is not suitable for air combat maneuvering. The MiG-31 is a much more <b>versatile</b> and capable <b>aircraft</b> and is still able to employ the older R-40.|$|R
40|$|The National Aerospace Plane is an {{extremely}} <b>versatile</b> and adaptable <b>aircraft.</b> It can be developed into an Orient Express that would dramatically improve trade with countries in Asia and elsewhere: a commuter transport to ferry men and materials to space, an advanced tactical fighter or bomber, and an unparalleled high altitude spy-plane to observe troubled spots all over the globe. Utilizing the technology developed by this pilot program, {{it will be possible}} to quickly and easily get to low Earth orbit, go halfway around the world in a fraction of the time it previously took, and lead the world in the development of advanced technology to improve our lives and the lives of many others...|$|R

50|$|At {{the request}} of many, Jordanoff, as a {{designer}} and engineer within his own enterprise, compiled instruction books and manuals for the operation and maintenance, inspection and repair for some well-known aircraft such as the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, a very <b>versatile</b> <b>aircraft</b> used during World War II mainly as high-speed, high-altitude fighter, long-range escort fighter and photo reconnaissance plane; the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, America's foremost fighter in service when World War II began; the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, the best long-range bombers in World War II; the Consolidated B-24 Liberator and the North American B-25 Mitchell bombers, and the Douglas DC-3 transport aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|A {{change in}} {{aircraft}} design theory to stress <b>versatile</b> multi-role <b>aircraft</b> {{meant that the}} F-4G was the last aircraft in the USAF inventory specifically outfitted for the SEAD role. The Wild Weasel mission is now assigned to the F-16 Fighting Falcon, using the Block 50 and Block 52, with production beginning in 1991. The single-seat Block 50/52 F-16C is specifically tasked with this mission. The pilot now performs both the role of flying the airplane and targeting and employing against ground threats. Other aircraft, while capable of taking out anti-air emplacements, are typically tasked with other primary missions; the A-10 Thunderbolt II [...] "Warthog", primarily tasked with CAS missions, lacks the avionics to perform a true SEAD mission in its original [...] "A" [...] variant, and the newer [...] "C" [...] variant, with conversions beginning in 2005, has yet to meet an enemy force possessing significant air defenses beyond man-portable SAMs. The F-15E, possessing advanced air-to-ground avionics but also high speed and long range, is typically tasked with [...] "deep strike" [...] missions, which can include SAM installations but typically focuses on high-value targets such as enemy command & control, infrastructure and production.|$|R
50|$|Dornier's most {{significant}} military aircraft design {{before and during}} World War II was the Do 17, nicknamed The Flying Pencil. It was developed and first flown in 1934 as a commercial aircraft in competition for a Lufthansa contract. Due to its narrow fuselage (hence its nickname) it was not commercially attractive and was passed over by Lufthansa. Dornier then further developed it as a military aircraft with a prototype bomber first flying in 1935. In 1937, it was employed in pro-Fascist terror bombings by the German Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War. Production continued within Germany and this <b>versatile</b> two-engined <b>aircraft</b> {{was developed by the}} Luftwaffe into multiple combat variations. The medium bomber variant saw much service during the early part of World War II including extensive use in the Battle of Britain. It was later developed into an effective nightfighter to defend Germany from the RAF bomber offensive. Dornier developed the successful Do 217 based on the Do 17; ostensibly looking like its younger sibling, this larger and much heavier bomber was in fact a completely new design. Dornier also developed the fastest piston-engined fighter of the war, the two-engined Do 335, introduced too late to enter combat service.|$|R
50|$|During Fiscal Year 1982, the 68th Bomb Wing began {{phasing out}} all B-52 {{operations}} and the unit was officially inactivated on 30 September 1982. On that same date, the 68th Air Refueling Group (68 ARG) was activated and on 1 October 1982, the 68th Air Refueling Group, and the 68th Bombardment Wing, Heavy, were consolidated {{into a single}} organization at Seymour Johnson. The 68 ARG continued to fly the KC-135 Stratotanker until 1 October 1985, when it converted to the larger, more modern and <b>versatile</b> KC-10 Extender <b>aircraft.</b> The 68 ARG was redesignated the 68th Air Refueling Wing (68 ARW) on 1 October 1986. The 68th ARW was merged into the renamed 4th Wing on 22 April 1991. On 1 October 1994, the KC-10 component was separated from the 4th Wing and reassigned to McGuire AFB, New Jersey where it {{became part of the}} newly reformed 305th Air Mobility Wing of the Air Mobility Command.|$|R
50|$|On 10 May 2013, the B.C. provincial {{government}} {{announced that the}} Hawaii Mars {{would no longer be}} placed on contract after the 2013 season, due to not having been used to fight any B.C. fires for two years and the operation of newer and more <b>versatile</b> <b>aircraft</b> by the Coulson group including a Lockheed C-130 Hercules converted to firefighting use.

5000|$|In 1957, the {{squadron}} {{changed from a}} fighter-bomber role to become 402 [...] "City of Winnipeg" [...] (Transport) Squadron, initially equipped with eight Beech CT-128 (C-45) Beechcraft Model 18 Expeditors. In April 1960, the Squadron was equipped with two CSR-123 (DHC-3) de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter aircraft. The Otter {{proved to be a}} highly <b>versatile</b> <b>aircraft</b> and greatly increased the scope of squadron operations. On 1 April 1961, 402 Squadron was transferred to Air Transport Command. This change brought the additional responsibility of the provision of regular service flights from Winnipeg, west to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, as well as to many northern points, and, by 1964, two additional Otters had been added to the Squadron inventory.|$|E
5000|$|Initially the F-111Ds were {{crippled}} by avionics problems. The horizontal situation display {{was prone to}} frequent failures, delivery of field ground equipment was late, and depot support was poor. There were excessive reliability and maintenance problems with the Mk II avionics, so severe that at times line mechanics were forced to resort to buying parts at Radio Shack. Operational readiness remained low all throughout 1973, and the abort rate of the F-111D was {{higher than that of}} other F-111s. It was not until January 1974 that the F-111D was finally declared operationally ready. But, when fully operational, the F-111D was regarded as the deadliest, most <b>versatile</b> <b>aircraft</b> in the entire NATO inventory.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{the real}} World War II Western Allies, {{they are a}} {{coalition}} of the United States, Great Britain and the French Resistance. Because of this, their units are a mixture of each side, such as the British Matilda tank and American M26 Pershing. They have a technological advantage over the other factions, because their buildings are able to power themselves, {{without the need for}} power plants. They also have a superior air force that is larger, stronger and more <b>versatile.</b> These include <b>aircraft</b> such as the P-38 Lightning bomber (the only bomber capable of defending itself against interceptors) P-51 Mustang fighters and attack helicopters. The Allies also have the atomic bomb at their disposal, deployed by a Northrop YB-35 and an [...] "earthquake bomb" [...] via a Halifax bomber. The Allied experimental unit is the O.R.B. (Omni-Repulsor-Barrier), which is an APC truck with a force-field generator on the back, capable of protecting units, within its deflector shield range, from low to medium attacks.|$|R
40|$|Growing {{demand for}} aircrafts, the {{competitive}} global market, and customer-focused individualization call for <b>versatile</b> and cost-effective <b>aircraft</b> production systems with high output. Concerning these needs automation with industrial robots is a promising solution as robots have already shown their {{performance in the}} automotive industry. Nevertheless, aircraft production automation is a challenge as robots with high absolute accuracy are needed. The main reasons for this requirement are high tolerances of the components resulting from their huge dimensions and part-manufacturing processes making automotive typical teach-in strategies impossible. Especially processes like machining that even need absolute path accuracy of the robot are challenging. Besides a detailed state-of-the-art analysis of robot accuracy and an optimized strategy for application-oriented robot calibration this paper also presents a new approach for advanced accuracy assessment. By simultaneously recording robot controller axes values and actual Tool Center Point poses with a laser tracker, the error chain can be acquired, separated, and thereby indications for different error sources and ways to eliminate them are discovered. To make evaluation and interpretation easier for the operator, the obtained pose-error-results are depicted by 3 D-plotsand error-histograms. In addition the impact on part accuracy, which typically cannot be judged from pose-errors, is visualized by material removal simulations considering the real (laser tracker measurements) and virtual (controller data) toolpaths acquired. To take the nonlinear behaviour of industrial robots into account, application-representative trajectories are used. The paper makes clear that especially in the aerospace production a use-case dependent optimization is reasonable and effective...|$|R
5000|$|In another {{alignment}} with AMC, more than 9,100 Air Force Reservists {{train in the}} C-130 Hercules theater airlift mission {{in a variety of}} aircrew, aircraft maintenance and support skills as both stand alone AFRC units and in [...] "Associate" [...] arrangements with Regular Air Force and Air National Guard C-130 units. In wartime, AFRC provides 23 percent of Air Force's total C-130 theater airlift force, with nearly half of the Air Force Reserve's airlift units flying their own unit-assigned C-130 Hercules aircraft, several of which have now integrated Active Associate units from the Regular Air Force. The C-130's speed, range, load-carrying characteristics and capability to operate under difficult terrain conditions make it an invaluable and <b>versatile</b> <b>aircraft,</b> strong enough to deliver its cargo on unimproved landing strips.|$|E
