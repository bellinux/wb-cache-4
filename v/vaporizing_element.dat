40|$|A {{description}} is given {{of the experimental}} apparatus and the methods used {{in the investigation of}} the degree of fuel (kerosene) evaporation in two types of vaporizing elements in combustion chambers. The results are presented as dependences of the degree of fuel evaporation on the factors which characterize the functioning of the vaporizing elements: the air surplus coefficient, the velocity of flow and temperature of the air {{at the entrance to the}} <b>vaporizing</b> <b>element</b> and the temperature of the wall of the <b>vaporizing</b> <b>element...</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{production}} of ferroelectric thin films using the MOCVD technology. The main focus is put on the design and construction of a complete MOCVD research system that {{is equipped with a}} novel non-contact vaporizer system. The precursors are nebulized in an ultrasonic atomizer and injected into a hot gas stream, so they can vaporize without getting into contact with a hot surface. Hence, one of the biggest disadvantages of conventional vaporizer concepts, the contamination of the <b>vaporizing</b> <b>element</b> with decomposing chemicals, could be avoided completely, resulting in a nearly maintenance-free system. In a direct comparison with the well-established Direct Liquid Injection Subsystem DLI- 25 C from MKS Instruments, the advantages of non-contact evaporation were clearly demonstrated. Additionally, the scope of this work included the development of standard deposition processes for the ternary oxides SrTiO_ 3, BaTiO_ 3 und PbTiO_ 3 and growth studies were performed. Electrical measurements performed on MIM structures with Pt electrodes and SrTiO_ 3 as dielectric indicate a high film quality comparable with results presented in the literature. Furthermore, {{for the first time the}} solid solution (Pb_xBa_ 1 _-_x) TiO_ 3 has been deposited by MOCVD. This material system is widely unknown in thin film form and it is well suited as a model system to investigate the influence of mechanical stresses on the film properties, because it represents a transition between the (as a thin film) superparaelectric barium titanate and the ferroelectric lead titanate. Through variation of the lead/barium ratio the tetragonal distortion of the lattice cell could be adjusted in a wide range. (orig.)

40|$|Four {{cases of}} toxic {{polyneuropathy}} due to glue-sniffing were reported. Neurological examination revealed motor predominant mixed type polyneuropathy. The cause of polyneuropathies {{in these cases}} {{was considered to be}} due to the inhalation of the <b>vaporized</b> <b>elements</b> of the adhesive agent, which contain mainly n-hexane and toluene. N-hexane is considered to be chiefly responsible for the polyneuropathy, though toluene also could have some influence on the illness...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{workplace}} environment measurements during welding {{of stainless steel}} with carbon dioxide and Neodymiurn-YAG-lasers will be given. The measurements were performed under reproducible conditions in three different capsuled working cells with defined ventilation. These different laser applications in combination with exhaust air systems will be compared and evaluated for industrial use. The fumes originated by the welding process were sucked by global or local effected exhaust air systems. The measured concentrations of inhalable and respirable dust and also certain <b>vaporized</b> <b>elements</b> will be compared. A comparison to German limit values will show {{the potential for a}} possible risk...|$|R
40|$|The {{dependence}} of analyte sensitivity and vaporization efficiency on the sampling depth of an {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometer (ICPMS) was investigated {{for a wide range}} of ele-ments in aerosols, produced by laser ablation of silicate glass. The ion signals were recorded for two different laser ablation systems and carrier gases. Differences in atomization efficiency and analyte sensitivity are significant for the two gases and the particle size distribution of the aerosol. Vaporiza-tion of the aerosol is enhanced when helium is used, which is attributed to a better energy transfer from the plasma to the central channel of the ICP and a higher diffusion rate of the vaporized mate-rial. Stable signal is achieved at smaller particle size distribution in laser-generated aerosol. The sensitivity change with sampling depth variation is dependent on m/z of the analyte ion and the chemical properties of the element. Elements with high vaporization temperatures need longer residence time to be atomized and ionized in ICP plasma and reach a maximum at increasing sam-pling depth than easily <b>vaporized</b> <b>elements,</b> especially for bigger particle size distributions generated by 266 nm laser in Argon...|$|R
40|$|A newly {{developed}} laboratory, Meteoric Ablation Simulator (MASI), {{is used to}} test model predictions of the atmospheric ablation of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) with experimental Na, Fe, and Ca vaporization profiles. MASI is the first laboratory setup capable of performing time-resolved atmospheric ablation simulations, by means of precision resistive heating and atomic laser-induced fluorescence detection. Experiments using meteoritic IDP analogues show that at least three mineral phases (Na-rich plagioclase, metal sulfide, and Mg-rich silicate) are required to explain the observed appearance temperatures of the <b>vaporized</b> <b>elements.</b> Low melting temperatures of Na-rich plagioclase and metal sulfide, compared to silicate grains, preclude equilibration of all the elemental constituents in a single melt. The phase-change process of distinct mineral components determines {{the way in which}} Na and Fe evaporate. Ca evaporation is dependent on particle size and on the initial composition of the molten silicate. Measured vaporized fractions of Na, Fe, and Ca as a function of particle size and speed confirm differential ablation (i. e., the most volatile elements such as Na ablate first, followed by the main constituents Fe, Mg, and Si, and finally the most refractory elements such as Ca). The Chemical Ablation Model (CABMOD) provides a reasonable approximation to this effect based on chemical fractionation of a molten silicate in thermodynamic equilibrium, even though the compositional and geometric description of IDPs is simplistic. Improvements in the model are required in order to better reproduce the specific shape of the elemental ablation profiles...|$|R
40|$|The {{dependence}} of analyte sensitivity and vaporization efficiency {{on the operating}} parameters of an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS) was investigated {{for a wide range}} of elements in aerosols, produced by laser ablation of silicate glass. The ion signals were recorded for different carrier gas flow rates at different plasma power for two different laser ablation systems and carrier gases. Differences in atomization efficiency and analyte sensitivity are significant for the two gases and the particle size distribution of the aerosol. Vaporization of the aerosol is enhanced when helium is used, which is attributed to a better energy-transfer from the plasma to the central channel of the ICP and a higher diffusion rate of the vaporized material. This minimizes elemental fractionation caused by sequential evaporation and reduces diffusion losses in the ICP. The sensitivity change with carrier gas flow variation is dependent on m/z of the analyte ion and the chemical properties of the element. Elements with high vaporization temperatures reach a maximum at lower gas flow rates than easily <b>vaporized</b> <b>elements.</b> The sensitivity change is furthermore dependent on m/z of the analyte ion, due to the mass {{dependence of}} the ion kinetic energies. The mass response curve of the ICPMS is thus not only a result of space charge effects in the ion optics but is also affected by radial diffusion of analyte ions and the mismatch between their kinetic energy after expansion in the vacuum interface and the ion optic settings...|$|R
50|$|If a steam {{explosion}} {{occurs in a}} confined tank of water due to rapid heating of the water, the pressure wave and rapidly expanding steam can cause severe water hammer. This was the mechanism that, in Idaho, USA, in 1961, caused the SL-1 nuclear reactor vessel to jump over 9 ft in the air when it was destroyed by a criticality accident. In the case of SL-1, the fuel and fuel <b>elements</b> <b>vaporized</b> from instantaneous overheating.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{methods have been}} {{investigated}} and are under current investigation for monitoring {{the health of the}} Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). Plume emission analysis has recently emerged as a potential technique for correlating the emission characteristics with the health of an engine. In order to correlate the visual and spectral signatures of the plume emission with the characteristic health monitoring features of the engine, the plume emission data must be acquired, stored, and analyzed {{in a manner similar to}} flame emission spectroscopy. The characteristic visual and spectral signatures of the <b>elements</b> <b>vaporized</b> in exhaust plume along with the features related to their temperature, pressure, and velocity can be analyzed once the images of plume emission are effectively acquired, digitized, and stored on a computer. Since the emission image varies with respect to time at a specified planar location, four dimensional visual and spectral analysis need to be performed on the plume emission data. In order to achieve this objective, feasibility research was conducted to digitize, store, analyze, and visualize the images of a subsonic jet in a cross flow. The jet structure was made visible using a direct injection flow visualization technique. The results of time-history based three dimensional reconstruction of the cross sectional images corresponding to a specific planar location of the jet structure are presented. The experimental set-up to acquire such data is described and three dimensional displays of time-history based reconstructions of the jet structure are discussed...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} NASA Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) {{chemical}} release {{program in}} September 1990, two Ba and also one each Sr and Ca canisters of a boron-titanium thermite mixture, which <b>vaporizes</b> the <b>element</b> on ignition, were released near perigee after dusk in the South Pacific to study the critical velocity effect proposed by Alfven. The critical velocities of these three elements are 2. 7, 3. 5, and 5. 4 km/s respectively, all well below the orbital velocity of 9. 4 km/s. On September 10, 1990, a Sr and Ba pair (G- 13, or critical ionization velocity (CIV) I) was released near Rarotonga at approximately 515 km altitude in a background electron density of 3. 4 x 10 (exp 6) /cu cm. On September 14, 1990, G- 14 or CIV II released a Ca and Ba pair west of New Caledonia near 595 km at an electron density of 1. 5 x 10 (exp 6) /cu cm. Ions of all three elements were observed with low-light level imagers from two aircraft after they had transited up the magnetic field lines into the sunlight. Emissions from the spherically expanding neutral gas shells below the solar terminator, observed with cameras filtered for the Ba(+) ion line at 4554 A and also in unfiltered imagers for approximately 15 s after release, are probably due to excitation by hot electrons created in the CIV process. The ions created clearly lost much of their energy, which we now show {{can be explained by}} elastic collisions: Ba(+) + O. Inventories of the observed ions indicate yields of 0. 15 % and 1. 84 % for Ba in the first and second experiments, 0. 02 % for Sr and 0. 27 % for Ca. Ionization from all the releases continued along the satellite trajectory much longer (greater than 45 s) than expected for a CIV process. The ion production along the satellite track versus time typically shows a rapid rise to a peak in a few seconds followed by an exponential decrease to a level essentially constant rate. The characteristic distances for CIV I and II are 47 and 62 km, respectively. We interpret the early time rise and exponential fall to be due to CIV ionization, of 0. 014 % (CIV I) and 0. 40 % (CIV II) for the Ba releases. The later ions produced at a constant rate probably have origins from other such processes as stripping and associative ionization collisions with atmospheric constituents primarily O, and charge exchange with O(+), He(+), and H(+). We suggest that the much larger Ba ionization rate in CIV II than CIV I {{is due to the fact}} that the release occurred in the peak Ca density where hot electrons were already present...|$|R
40|$|The {{thermochemical}} equilibrium calculations {{indicate that}} at the temperature of a propane [...] air flame, some volatilization of uranium, plutonium, technetium, and cesium will occur. The expected concentrations of plutonium, technetium, and cesium in the flame will be very low {{because of the small}} maximum concentration of these elements in the projected feed materials for the first 30 -day test. The quantities volatilized can generally be decreased by operating the flame in a fuel-rich mode, although this will lead to greater carbon monoxide production, which may be more objectionable. The concentrations of chlorine and fluorine, at least at the maximum levels in the projected Vortec feed, are not projected to greatly influence the vaporization rates. Therefore, blending to reduce the concentrations of those elements would most likely not be effective in reducing metal vaporization. Most of the <b>elements</b> <b>vaporized</b> condense by the time the gas cools to 2000 F. These elements would condense either on surfaces near the front of the heat recuperator or on entrained particulates or homogeneously as relatively pure submicron particles. Cesium would be expected to condense at the lower temperatures near the rear of the recuperator, although the expected maximum concentration in the Vortec feed material is extremely low so it should be greatly diluted by other particulates. The elements that condense on other entrained particles will form enriched surface coatings. Particles larger than 10 {micro}m or so will be collected in the scrubber. Smaller particles, especially the submicron particles formed from homogeneous nucleation, should be largely collected in the HEPA filter. Deposits formed in the heat recuperator can normally be handled via sootblowing. To reduce handling problems, we suggest that the recuperator be oriented vertically so that the deposits blown off of the heat exchanger fall directly into the molten glass. The large size of the deposits should help to reduce the rate of revaporization, allowing the volatile elements to be removed with the glass. The volatile elements that do not deposit on system surfaces will be concentrated in the smaller particles. Therefore, the HEPA ash will be greatly enriched in these elements. If the HEPA filter is itself sent to a melter, the elements may revaporize and multiply the problems related to metal vaporization significantly. Therefore, the HEPA filters should be disposed of without high-temperature processing. Also, to reduce the formation of these very small particles, it is helpful to include in the feed larger particles to act as condensation nuclei that can then be collected in the scrubber. This can be accomplished by using feed materials with a fraction consisting of particles small enough {{that they will not be}} collected in the cyclone in the melter, but large enough that they will easily be collected by the scrubber. This is one advantage that firing bituminous coal has over gas firing; it provides a source of ash particles of the right size range to serve as nucleation sites, but large enough (depending on the coal) so that they can usually be collected efficiently in the scrubber system...|$|R
