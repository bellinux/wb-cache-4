40|$|AbstractThe Native <b>Vegetation</b> <b>Protection</b> Law of Brazil, which {{replaced}} the Forest Code from 1965, is still undergoing regulation at {{federal and state}} levels, and the constitutionality of some clauses are still in question. In order to support legal rulings, decisions by public officers, and to inform other stakeholders, we present a balanced assessment of {{the positive and negative}} consequences of Native <b>Vegetation</b> <b>Protection</b> Law in light of current scientific knowledge. Key advances were noted in the systems of controls and incentives, which promoted new mechanisms and policies to support the implementation of this law. The main environmental setbacks were (i) the removal of protection of certain environmentally fragile areas, (ii) the concession of amnesty of fines incurred for violating the preceding legislation, (iii) allowing continuous farming or maintenance of infrastructure in areas protected by law, without full recovery of native vegetation. The weakening of Native <b>Vegetation</b> <b>Protection</b> Law may hamper soil and watershed protection, biodiversity conservation, and even agricultural productivity, without manifest benefits for the country. On that account, we recommend that: (i) judiciary rulings and state and county regulations to correct pending issues with the Native <b>Vegetation</b> <b>Protection</b> Law based on scientific knowledge and with wider citizen participation; (ii) the strengthening of agencies for rural technical assistance; (iii) the development of incentives to develop the supply chain for native vegetation recovery; (iv) the regulation of compensation for Legal Reserves based on clear and robust environmental criteria; and (v) the assessment of legal compliance has also {{to be based on the}} environmental quality of recovered areas...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Permanent {{preservation}} areas (PPAs) {{adjacent to}} drainage channels may include forests, savannahs, or grassland Under a former environmental legislation ("Forest Code"), it {{was required to}} maintain a strip of native vegetation (at least 30 m wide) at the margin of any drainage channel, to support environmental functions. Under the current native <b>vegetation</b> <b>protection</b> policy, if a riparian margin was degraded prior to 2008, the landholder is required to regenerate a strip of only 5 - 20 m, in some cases. The present study evaluated and compared the ligneous vegetation structure in 10 preserved PPAs (following {{the requirements of the}} old law) and 10 degraded PPAs (conforming to the current environmental legislation), in Mineiros municipality, southwest Goiás. Sixty plots measuring 15 m × 30 m were delineated, and data for all ligneous individuals with a diameter at breast height (DBH) &# 8805; 5 cm were recorded. A total of 2, 662 individuals were documented, distributed among 208 species. Of the total, 1, 573 individuals belonging to 167 species were from the preserved PPAs, and 1, 089 individuals across 142 species were from the degraded PPAs. According to these results, the preserved PPAs were richer in species composition than in the degraded PPAs (245. 5 ± 34. 36 and 213. 3 ± 34. 1, respectively), in addition to being more abundant in terms of individuals. The importance value index (IVI) was well distributed among the species. All the degraded PPAs presented signs of erosion. It was concluded that the reduced width of the PPAs (5 - 20 m) under the current native <b>vegetation</b> <b>protection</b> policy would result in a loss of the environmental functions sought by the legislation. ...|$|E

40|$|Currently, many {{soil erosion}} studies at local, regional, {{national}} or continental scale use models {{based on the}} USLE-family approaches. Applications of these models pay little attention to seasonal changes, despite evidence in the literature which suggests that erosion risk may change rapidly according to intra-annual rainfall figures and vegetation phenology. This paper emphasises the aspect of seasonality in soil erosion mapping by using month-step rainfall erosivity data and biophysical time series data derived from remote-sensing. The latter, together with other existing pan-European geo-databases sets {{the basis for a}} functional pan-European service for soil erosion monitoring at a scale of 1 : 500, 000. This potential service has led to the establishment of a new modelling approach (called the G 2 model) based on the inheritance of USLE-family models.

The change of shear strength indexes of the soil reinforced with roots of Manilagrass was investigated with the quantity of grassroots planted in the soil specimens. The results of laboratory triaxial tests show that the strength and capacity for resisting the deformation of soil reinforced with roots are better than those of unreinforced soil. And under the certain number of grassroots layers, the strength and capacity for resisting the deformation of soil reinforced with roots increase firstly and then reduce with the increasing of Manilagrass roots quantity. In other words, there is an optimal quantity of Manilagrass roots affecting the strength and capacity for resisting the deformation of soil reinforced with roots.

40|$|Possums, {{a native}} of Australia, were first liberated in New Zealand in 1858 to provide a source of fur.

Nevertheless, effects of protection from herbivores on the vegetation of High-elevation meadows in Iran have not been studied so far. To assess effects of experimentally short-term exclosure treatment on production of mountainous meadows, two meadow sites were selected in Sabzkouh Protected Area in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province. In each site, three 16 m 2 (2 × 8 m) fences were established and in each fence three 1 m 2 plots were marked {{at the beginning of the}} growing season (April). Similarly, three 1 m 2 plots were placed outside each fence (resulting in 18 grazed and 18 protected plots). In the second year at peak vegetation growth and shortly before grazing season (July), above-ground biomass was cut in all plots and then dry weights of vegetative and reproductive organs were determined separately. Grazing exclusion significantly increased total biomass, while it decreased the proportion of reproductive biomass in meadow <b>vegetation</b> community. <b>Protection</b> from grazing increased biomass production of dominant and tall plant species (e. g., Carex orbicularis), but had reverse effects on smaller and less frequent species.

The aim of this project is to demonstrate to government that public and/or private funds can be efficiently allocated for <b>vegetation</b> corridor <b>protection</b> through voluntary engagement with landholders. The mechanism to demonstrate is a type of auction system where competing proposals for corridor locations are evaluated for potential funding. There are several ways that an auction or tender system can be designed to employ a competitive process to allocate public funding for corridor establishment. To identify the most appropriate mechanisms, a series of experimental workshops have been designed where landholders will be asked to indicate potential corridors and required annual incentive payments on maps of ‘dummy’ or ‘mock’ properties. ‘Dummy’ properties are being used as a way of controlling and limiting the influence of a number of variables. In this way the relevant opportunity cost and transaction cost variables can be related to the bid amounts in the workshops. Two trials have been held of the experimental workshop process, and the insights from those trials have been used to improve the procedures. The main workshops will be formed of two components.
