5|$|If {{there is}} {{doubt about the}} cause of the skin lesions, a biopsy of the skin may be {{performed}} to distinguish the purpura from other diseases that cause it, such as <b>vasculitis</b> due to cryoglobulinemia; on microscopy the appearances are of a hypersensitivity <b>vasculitis,</b> and immunofluorescence demonstrates IgA and C3 (a protein of the complement system) in the blood vessel wall. However, overall serum complement levels are normal.|$|E
5|$|HSP occurs {{more often}} in {{children}} than in adults, and usually follows an upper respiratory tract infection. Half of affected patients are below the age of six, and 90% are under ten. It occurs about twice as often in boys as in girls. The incidence of HSP in children is about 20 per 100,000 children per year, making it the most common <b>vasculitis</b> in children.|$|E
5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura is a small-vessel <b>vasculitis</b> {{in which}} {{complexes}} of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and complement component 3 (C3) are deposited on arterioles, capillaries, and venules. As with IgA nephropathy, serum levels of IgA {{are high in}} HSP and there are identical findings on renal biopsy; however, IgA nephropathy has a predilection for young adults while HSP is more predominant among children. Further, IgA nephropathy typically only affects the kidneys while HSP is a systemic disease. HSP involves the skin and connective tissues, scrotum, joints, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|On {{the basis}} of symptoms, it is {{possible}} to distinguish HSP from hypersensitivity <b>vasculitis</b> (HV). In a series comparing 85 HSP patients with 93 HV patients, five symptoms were found to be indicative of HSP: palpable purpura, abdominal angina, digestive tract hemorrhage (not due to intussussception), hematuria and age less than 20. The presence of three or more of these indicators has an 87% sensitivity for predicting HSP.|$|E
5|$|HSP is a {{systemic}} <b>vasculitis</b> (inflammation of blood vessels) and {{is characterized by}} deposition of immune complexes containing the antibody immunoglobulin A (IgA); the exact cause for this phenomenon is unknown. In children it usually resolves within several weeks and requires no treatment apart from symptom control, but may relapse in a third of cases and cause irreversible kidney damage in about one in a hundred cases. In adults the prognosis is different than in children. The average duration of cutaneous lesions is 27.9 months. And for many {{it tends to be}} relapsing-remitting {{over a long period of}} time rather than self-limiting and there tend to be more complications.|$|E
5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP), {{also known}} as IgA <b>vasculitis,</b> anaphylactoid purpura, purpura rheumatica, and Schönlein–Henoch purpura, is a disease of the skin, mucous membranes, and {{sometimes}} other organs that most commonly affects children. In the skin, the disease causes palpable purpura (small, raised areas of bleeding underneath the skin), often with joint pain and abdominal pain. With kidney involvement, {{there may be a}} loss of small amounts of blood and protein in the urine (hematuria and proteinuria), but this usually goes unnoticed; in a small proportion of cases, the kidney involvement proceeds to chronic kidney disease. HSP is often preceded by an infection, such as a throat infection.|$|E
5|$|Adler's throat closes {{up during}} the MRI due to an {{allergic}} reaction to gadolinium, prompting two members of House's team, Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), to perform a tracheotomy. Working in the hospital's clinic, House's first patient {{is a man who}} is orange because of an over-consumption of carrots and mega-dose vitamins (niacin). House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic inhaler only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticises the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral <b>vasculitis,</b> despite having no proof. House treats Adler with steroids, which improves her condition greatly for a time, until she starts seizing and has heart failure. The team brings her back with a defibrillator.|$|E
25|$|Kawasaki {{disease may}} be further {{classified}} as a medium-sized-vessel <b>vasculitis,</b> affecting medium- and small-sized blood vessels, such as the smaller cutaneous vasculature (veins and arteries in the skin) that range from 50 to 100µm in diameter. Kawasaki disease is also {{considered to be a}} primary childhood <b>vasculitis,</b> a disorder associated with <b>vasculitis</b> that mainly affects {{children under the age of}} 18. A recent, consensus-based evaluation of vasculitides occurring primarily in children resulted in a classification scheme for these disorders, to distinguish them and suggest a more concrete set of diagnostic criteria for each. Within this classification of childhood vasculitides, Kawasaki disease is, again, a predominantly medium-sized vessel <b>vasculitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several {{forms of}} <b>vasculitis</b> occur in RA, but are mostly seen with long-standing and {{untreated}} disease. The most common presentation {{is due to}} involvement of small- and medium-sized vessels. Rheumatoid <b>vasculitis</b> can thus commonly present with skin ulceration and vasculitic nerve infarction known as mononeuritis multiplex.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation, or <b>vasculitis</b> of {{the arteries}} and veins occurs {{throughout}} the body. This is usually caused by increased production of {{the cells of the}} immune system to a pathogen, or autoimmunity. Systemic vasculitides may be classified according to the type of cells involved in the proliferation, as well as the specific type of tissue damage occurring within the vein or arterial walls. Under this classification scheme for systemic <b>vasculitis,</b> Kawasaki disease {{is considered to be a}} necrotizing <b>vasculitis</b> (also called necrotizing angiitis), which may be identified histologically by the occurrence of necrosis (tissue death), fibrosis, and proliferation of cells associated with inflammation in the inner layer of the vascular wall.|$|E
25|$|Levamisole, {{which is}} a common {{adulterant}} of cocaine, can cause an ANCA positive <b>vasculitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In severe kidney <b>vasculitis,</b> {{the same}} regimen is used {{but with the}} {{addition}} of plasma exchange.|$|E
25|$|Leptospirosis is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by a}} spirochaete. Symptoms include liver and kidney failure and <b>vasculitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{diseases}} featuring necrotizing <b>vasculitis</b> include polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), Henoch–Schönlein purpura and {{eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis}} (EGPA).|$|E
25|$|Vascular disease {{includes}} large vessel disease such as bilateral renal artery stenosis {{and small}} vessel disease such as ischemic nephropathy, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and <b>vasculitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ehrlichiosis is {{a disease}} caused by Ehrlichia canis and spread by the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Signs include fever, <b>vasculitis,</b> and low blood counts.|$|E
25|$|Drug-induced hepatic granulomas {{are usually}} {{associated}} with granulomas in other tissues and patients typically have features of systemic <b>vasculitis</b> and hypersensitivity. More than 50 drugs have been implicated.|$|E
25|$|Less common causes include {{pancreatic}} cancer, pancreatic duct stones, <b>vasculitis</b> (inflammation of {{the small}} {{blood vessels in the}} pancreas), and porphyria—particularly acute intermittent porphyria and erythropoietic protoporphyria.|$|E
25|$|Etanercept {{is being}} studied as {{treatment}} {{for a number of}} diseases. This includes certain forms of <b>vasculitis</b> (such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, in which it was not effective).|$|E
25|$|Inflammatory {{eye disease}} can develop {{early in the}} disease course and lead to {{permanent}} vision loss in 20 percent of cases. Ocular involvement {{can be in the}} form of posterior uveitis, anterior uveitis, or retinal <b>vasculitis.</b> Anterior uveitis presents with painful eyes, conjuctival redness, hypopyon, and decreased visual acuity, while posterior uveitis presents with painless decreased visual acuity and visual field floaters. A rare form of ocular (eye) involvement in this syndrome is retinal <b>vasculitis</b> which presents with painless decrease of vision with the possibility of floaters or visual field defects.|$|E
25|$|If {{the person}} has kidney failure or {{cutaneous}} <b>vasculitis,</b> a biopsy is obtained from the kidneys. On rare occasions, thoracoscopic lung biopsy is required. On histopathological examination, a biopsy will show leukocytoclastic <b>vasculitis</b> with necrotic changes and granulomatous inflammation (clumps of typically arranged white blood cells) on microscopy. These granulomas are {{the main reason for}} the name granulomatosis with polyangiitis, although it is not an essential feature. Nevertheless, necrotizing granulomas are a hallmark of this disease. However, many biopsies can be nonspecific and 50% provide too little information for the diagnosis of GPA.|$|E
25|$|The acute {{stage of}} the disease, {{occurring}} most often {{in the spring and}} summer, begins one to three weeks after infection and lasts for two to four weeks. Clinical signs include a fever, petechiae, bleeding disorders, <b>vasculitis,</b> lymphadenopathy, discharge from the nose and eyes, and edema of the legs and scrotum. There are no outward signs of the subclinical phase. Clinical signs of the chronic phase include weight loss, pale gums due to anemia, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, <b>vasculitis,</b> lymphadenopathy, dyspnea, coughing, polyuria, polydipsia, lameness, ophthalmic diseases such as retinal hemorrhage and anterior uveitis, and neurological disease. Dogs that are severely affected can die from this disease.|$|E
25|$|Osler's nodes {{are raised}} tender nodules on the pulps of {{fingertips}} or toes, an autoimmune <b>vasculitis</b> that is suggestive of subacute bacterial endocarditis. They are usually painful, {{as opposed to}} Janeway lesions which are due to emboli and are painless.|$|E
25|$|The appearance: e.g., purpuric (typical of <b>vasculitis</b> and {{meningococcal}} disease), {{fine and}} like sandpaper (typical of scarlet fever); circular lesions {{with a central}} depression are typical of molluscum contagiosum (and in the past, small pox); plaques with silver scales are typical of psoriasis.|$|E
25|$|It {{is also an}} {{autoimmune}} form of <b>vasculitis,</b> and is {{not associated}} with ANCA antibodies, unlike other vasculitic disorders associated with them (such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis). This categorization is considered essential for appropriate treatment.|$|E
25|$|A {{systematic}} review of 84 trials examined {{the evidence for}} various treatments in GPA. Many trials include data on pooled groups of people with GPA and microscopic polyangiitis. In this review, cases are divided between localised disease, non-organ threatening, generalized organ-threatening disease and severe kidney <b>vasculitis</b> and immediately life-threatening disease.|$|E
25|$|The myriad {{causes of}} {{intrinsic}} AKI require specific therapies. For example, intrinsic AKI due to <b>vasculitis</b> or glomerulonephritis may respond to steroid medication, cyclophosphamide, and (in some cases) plasma exchange. Toxin-induced prerenal AKI often responds to discontinuation of the offending agent, such as ACE inhibitors, ARB antagonists, aminoglycosides, penicillins, NSAIDs, or paracetamol.|$|E
25|$|Aortic {{dissection}} {{is associated}} with hypertension (high blood pressure) and many connective tissue disorders. <b>Vasculitis</b> (inflammation of an artery) is rarely associated with aortic dissection. It can also {{be the result of}} chest trauma. About 72 to 80% of individuals who present with an aortic dissection have a previous history of hypertension.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish Raynaud's disease (primary Raynaud's) from phenomenon (secondary Raynaud's). Looking for signs of arthritis or <b>vasculitis</b> {{as well as a}} number of laboratory tests may separate them. If suspected to be secondary to systemic sclerosis, one tool which may help aid in the prediction of systemic sclerosis is thermography.|$|E
25|$|Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic {{antibodies}} (ANCAs) are a {{group of}} autoantibodies, mainly of the IgG type, against antigens in the cytoplasm of neutrophil granulocytes (the {{most common type of}} white blood cell) and monocytes. They are detected as a blood test in a number of autoimmune disorders, but are particularly associated with systemic <b>vasculitis,</b> so called ANCA-associated vasculitides.|$|E
25|$|Systemic {{autoimmune}} diseases include SLE, Sjögren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, cryoglobulinemic <b>vasculitis,</b> and dermatomyositis. These conditions tend to {{be associated}} with autoantibodies to antigens which are not tissue specific. Thus although polymyositis is more or less tissue specific in presentation, it may be included in this group because the autoantigens are often ubiquitous t-RNA synthetases.|$|E
25|$|ANCAs are {{associated}} with small vessel vasculitides including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis, primary pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis (a type of renal-limited microscopic polyangiitis), {{eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis}} (previously known as Churg-Strauss syndrome) and drug induced vasculitides. PR3 directed c-ANCA is present in 80-90% of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, 20-40% of microscopic polyangiitis, 20-40% of pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis and 35% of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. c-ANCA (atypical) is present in 80% of cystic fibrosis (with BPI as the target antigen) and also in inflammatory bowel disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis and rheumatoid arthritis (with antibodies to multiple antigenic targets). p-ANCA with MPO specificity is found in 50% of microscopic polyangiitis, 50% of primary pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis and 35% of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. p-ANCA with specificity to other antigens {{are associated}} with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, drug-induced <b>vasculitis,</b> autoimmune liver disease, drug induced syndromes and parasitic infections. Atypical ANCA is associated with drug-induced systemic <b>vasculitis,</b> inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous {{immunoglobulins}} {{may be used}} {{to control}} SLE with organ involvement, or <b>vasculitis.</b> It is believed that they reduce antibody production or promote the clearance of immune complexes from the body, even though their mechanism of action is not well understood. Unlike immunosuppressives and corticosteroids, IVIGs do not suppress the immune system, so there is less risk of serious infections with these drugs.|$|E
25|$|Large vessel disease {{involves}} the common and internal carotid arteries, the vertebral artery, and the Circle of Willis. Diseases that may form thrombi {{in the large}} vessels include (in descending incidence): atherosclerosis, vasoconstriction (tightening of the artery), aortic, carotid or vertebral artery dissection, various inflammatory diseases of the blood vessel wall (Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, <b>vasculitis),</b> noninflammatory vasculopathy, Moyamoya disease and fibromuscular dysplasia.|$|E
25|$|In acalculous cholecystitis, no {{stone is}} in the biliary ducts. It {{accounts}} for 5–10% of all cases of cholecystitis and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Acalculous cholecystitis is typically seen in people who are hospitalized and critically ill. Males {{are more likely to}} develop acute cholecystitis following surgery in the absence of trauma. It is associated with many causes including <b>vasculitis,</b> chemotherapy, major trauma or burns.|$|E
25|$|Tests for {{inflammation}} (C-reactive {{protein and}} the erythrocyte sedimentation rate) are typically elevated, and abnormal liver enzymes may be seen. If the kidneys are involved, tests of renal function (such as urea and creatinine) are elevated. The {{complete blood count}} may show particularly high numbers of a type of white blood cell known as eosinophils (more than 0.5 billion per liter); this occurs in only 60-80% of cases, so normal eosinophil counts do {{not rule out the}} diagnosis. Examination of the urine may show red blood cells (occasionally in casts as seen under the microscope) and increased levels of protein; in a third of the cases with kidney involvement, eosinophils can also be detected in the urine. If <b>vasculitis</b> is suspected, complement levels may be determined as reduced levels are often encountered in vasculitis; complement is a group of proteins that forms part of the innate immune system. Complement levels are frequently reduced in cholesterol embolism, limiting the use of this test in the distinction between <b>vasculitis</b> and cholesterol embolism.|$|E
