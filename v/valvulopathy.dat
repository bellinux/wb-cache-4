25|$|Lorcaserin is a {{full agonist}} for 5-HT2C and 5-HT2B receptors and partial agonist for 5-HT2A receptors (75% of the maximal {{response}} elicited by serotonin). Lorcaserin is a potent and selective 5-HT2C agonist with rapid oral absorption that shows dose-dependent decrease in food intake and body weight. Lorcaserin affects body weight by producing a negative energy balance through reduced food intake (energy intake) without alterations in energy expenditure and substrate oxidation. Lorcaserin has a high affinity for the 5-HT2C receptors, with 18-fold selectivity over 5-HT2A receptors and 104-fold over 5-HT2B receptors. The predicted blood concentration to stimulate 2A and 2B receptors is approximately 1400-fold for 2B and 250-fold for 2A, above the blood concentration that is required to stimulate the 2C receptors. This functional selectivity is critical to prevent potential side effects and suggests that the theoretical risk of cardiac <b>valvulopathy</b> is very low. Clinical trials have supported this theory since they have not revealed any side effects on heart valves or pulmonary artery pressure like the former obesity drugs. Lorcaserin is well tolerated in general, but the most frequent adverse effect are headache, nausea and dizziness.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Analyses of {{healthcare}} data from 30 million individuals in three countries showed that current use of bisphosphonates {{may be associated}} with a small increased risk of cardiac <b>valvulopathy</b> (vs. those not exposed within the previous year), although confounding cannot be entirely ruled out. The observed tendency for decreased <b>valvulopathy</b> risk with cumulative duration of bisphosphonate use > 6  months may even indicate a protective effect with prolonged use. Further studies are still needed to evaluate whether bisphosphonates increase or decrease the risk of <b>valvulopathy.</b> Introduction: A signal of cardiac valve disorders with use of bisphosphonates was identified in the literature and EudraVigilance database, which contains reports of suspected adverse drug reactions from worldwide sources. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the association using population-based healthcare data. Methods: This was a case-control study among users of bisphosphonates and other drugs for osteoporosis in six healthcare databases covering over 30 million individuals in Italy, Netherlands and the UK from 1996 to 2012. Prescriptions/dispensations were used to assess drug exposure. Newly diagnosed cases of cardiac <b>valvulopathy</b> were identified via disease codes/free-text search. Controls were matched to each case by age, sex, database and index date. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression for the pooled data and meta-analysis of individual database risk estimates. Results: A small but statistically significant association was found between exposure to bisphosphonates as a class and risk of <b>valvulopathy.</b> Overall risk was 18  % higher (95  % CI 12 – 23  %) in those currently exposed to any bisphosphonate (mainly alendronate and risedronate) vs. those not exposed within the previous year. Risk of valve regurgitation was 14  % higher (95  % CI 7 – 22  %). Decreased <b>valvulopathy</b> risk was observed with longer cumulative duration of bisphosphonate use, compared to use of less than 6  months. Meta-analyses of database-specific estimates confirmed results from pooled analyses. Conclusions: The observed increased risks of cardiac <b>valvulopathy</b> with bisphosphonate use, although statistically significant, were quite small and unlikely to be clinically significant.

A <b>valvulopathy</b> was identified in 31 patients (43 %), being previously unknown in 24 (33 %) and diagnosed only upon TEE or a second TTE in 7 (10 %). The major determinants associated with endocarditis were age (hazard ratio [HR], 1. 07; 95 % confi-dence interval [CI], 1. 006 – 1. 13; P =. 03), aortic regurgitation (HR, 10. 2; 95 % CI, 3. 2 – 32. 2; P <. 001), and mitral regurgitation (HR, 4. 78; 95 % CI, 1. 4 – 16. 0; P =. 01).

40|$|Background—Serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine; 5 -HT) {{overproduction}} {{is responsible}} for cardiac valvular disease in patients with carcinoid tumors. Reduced 5 -HT inactivation is one proposed mechanism of the <b>valvulopathy</b> observed in individuals treated with the appetite suppressants fenfluramine and phentermine. One key protein limiting systemic availability of 5 -HT is the 5 -HT transporter (5 -HTT) expressed by platelets and pulmonary vascular cells; 5 -HTT {{is responsible for}} 5 -HT uptake and subsequent inactivation of the amine passing through the lung. Here we investigated whether 5 -HTT–deficient (5 -HTT-KO) mice developed structural and/or functional cardiac abnormalities and <b>valvulopathy.</b> Methods and Results—Cardiac endothelial cells expressed large amounts of 5 -HTT in wild-type mice. 5 -HTT deficiency appeared {{to be associated with}} marked interstitial, perivascular, and valvular fibrosis as evidenced by staining of cardiac collagen in 5 -HTT-KO mice. Histological analysis provided evidence for <b>valvulopathy</b> characterized by valvular hyperplasia and prominent fibrosis at the attachment site and base of the leaflets.

Although 5 -HT 1 B receptors mediated the 5 -HT–induced collagen secretion by human cardiac myofibroblasts, the contribution of this receptor type to <b>valvulopathy</b> was ruled out because double-KO mice deficient in both 5 -HTT and 5 -HT 1 B receptors showed the same cardiac alterations as 5 -HTT-KO mice...|$|E
40|$|Q fever manifests {{as primary}} {{infection}} or acute Q fever and may become chronic {{in patients with}} underlying <b>valvulopathy.</b> Because Coxiella burnetii infection depends on host response, we measured tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL) – 6, IL- 12, and IL- 10 in patients with different clinical presentations of acute Q fever. Compared with control subjects, patients with uncomplicated acute Q fever exhibited increased release of the 4 cytokines. Their amounts were higher in patients with hepatitis than in patients with fever or pneumonia. In patients with <b>valvulopathy,</b> who exhibited the highest risk of chronic evolution, the amounts of TNF and IL- 10 were higher than in patients without <b>valvulopathy.</b> TNF production was specifically enhanced in patients who developed Q fever endocarditis. These results show that acute Q fever is associated with cytokine over-production.

40|$|Abstract. Obesity is a {{well-established}} {{risk factor for}} hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type II diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, orthopedic disorders, and certain cancers. Despite this risk, the prevalence of obesity continues to increase worldwide, {{and there is a}} growing demand for safe and effective antiobesity drugs. Previous antiobesity drugs or anorexigens, particularly centrally acting agents, have poor safety records. Life-threatening safety issues led to the withdrawal of aminorex in 1968, fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine in 1997, and phenylpropanolamine in 2000. Many of the safety issues, such as <b>valvulopathy</b> with fenfluramine and pulmonary arterial hypertension with aminorex, were initially not predicted by routine preclinical toxicology studies. To date, there are no validated animal models or preclinical and/or toxicologic screens to accurately predict anorexigen-induced <b>valvulopathy</b> and pulmonary arterial hypertension in humans.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the occurrence, the aetiology and the management of congestive heart failure in the cardiac centre of the St. Elizabeth catholic general hospital Shisong in Cameroon. METHODS: Between November 2002 and November 2008, a population of 8121 patients was consulted in the referral cardiac centre of St. Elizabeth Catholic General Hospital. Of these patients, 462 were diagnosed with congestive heart failure according to the modified Framingham criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure. Complementary investigations used to confirm and establish the aetiology of the disease were the chest X-ray, electrocardiography, bi-dimensional Doppler echocardiography. RESULTS: The results showed that the occurrence of congestive heart failure in our centre was 5, 7 %. Congestive heart failure was diagnosed in 198 females and 264 males, aged between 8 and 86 years old (42. 5, plus or minus 18 years old). Post rheumatic <b>valvulopathies</b> (14. 6 %) and congenital heart diseases (1. 9 %) were the first aetiologic factor of congestive heart failure in the young, meanwhile cardiomyopathies (8, 3 %) in elderly followed by hypertensive cardiomyopathy (4. 4 %). Congestive heart failure was also seen in adults with congenital heart diseases in 0. 01 %. In this zone of Cameroon, we discovered that HIV cardiomyopathy (1. 6 %) and Cor pulmonale (8 %) were represented, aetiological factors not mentioned in previous studies conducted in urban areas of Cameroon. The mean duration of hospital stay for the compensation treatment was thirteen days, ranging between 7 and 21 days), the mortality being 9. 2 %. All the medications recommended for the treatment of congestive heart failure are available in our centre but many patients are not compliant to the therapy or cannot afford them. Financial limitation is causing the exacerbation of the disease and premature death. CONCLUSION: Our data show a high incidence of congestive heart failure mainly due to post rheumatic <b>valvulopathies</b> in young patients in our centre. National program to fight against rheumatic fever and complications are of great urgency in our country. The compensation treatment of congestive heart failure is challenging in our milieu, characterized by poor compliance and financial limitation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Post-operatory wound {{infections are}} a very {{uncommon}} finding after thyroidectomy. For these reasons international guidelines do not routinely recommend systemic antibiotic prophylaxis. The benefits of this antibiotic prophylaxis is not supported by clinical evidence in the literature. We have conducted a multicentric randomized double-blind trial on 500 patients who had undergone thyroidectomy for goitre or thyroid carcinoma. The 500 patients enrolled in the study (mean age 47 years) were randomized in two subgroups of 250 patients. 250 patients were treated with standard antibiotic prophylaxis with sulbactam/ampicillin 1 fl (3 gr.) 30 min before surgery. No antibiotic prophylaxis was instituted in the remainder 250 patients. Our RCT showed that prophylactic antibiotic treatment is not beneficial in patients younger than eighty years old, with no concomitant metabolic, infective and hematologic disease, with no cardiac <b>valvulopathies,</b> not under steroidal or immunosuppressive treatment, and not severely obese. Our study should be regarded only as a preliminary RCT, and should {{be followed by a}} study in which a larger number of patients should be enrolled so that statistically significant data can be obtained. </p...|$|R
