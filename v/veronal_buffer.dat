40|$|By {{incorporation}} of trinitrophenylamino-caproyldipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (TNP-Cap-DPPE) into liposomes composed of an equimolecular mixture of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and cholesterol (TNP-Cap-liposomes), liposomes became readily lysed by guinea-pig serum (GPS) in Mg++-EGTA-GVB (gelatin <b>veronal</b> <b>buffered</b> saline containing 2 mM MgCl 2 and 10 mM ethyleneglycol-bis (beta-amino-ethyl ether) N-N'-tetraacetate) {{as well as}} in GVB++ (gelatin <b>veronal</b> <b>buffered</b> saline containing 0. 15 mM CaCl 2 and 0. 5 mM MgCl 2). Since the classical complement pathway (CCP) does not work in Mg++-EGTA-GVB, TNP-Cap-liposome lysis by GPS in Mg++-EGTA-GVB was thought to be mediated by the activation of the alternative complement pathway (ACP). This conclusion was supported by observations that heating of GPS at 50 degrees impaired its lytic activity while C 4 -deficient GPS was capable of lytic activity, no lysis occurred in EDTA, and there was noted consumption of complement in GPS treated with TNP-Cap-liposomes at 30 degrees. For TNP-Cap-liposome lysis by GPS in Mg++-EGTA-GVB, the epitope density of the TNP hapten was required to be 5 % or more of the DMPC. Changing the acyl group of the phosphatidylcholine (PC) significantly influenced the ACP activating capacity of TNP-Cap-liposome. Dipalmitoyl-PC, DMPC and distearoyl-PC facilitated the ACP activating capacity of the TNP-Cap-liposome, while dilauroyl-PC, egg-PC and dioleoyl-PC did not. Furthermore, the length of spacer between TNP and dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE) also influenced the ACP activating capacity and maximum activation was noted when the spacer was aminocaproyl. These physicochemical characteristics which increase the ACP activating capacity coincided with those reported to increase the immunogenicity of hapten-sensitized liposomes...|$|R

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} and specificity of counterimmunoelectrophoresis using three antigenic preparations obtained from Salmonella typhi were {{compared with those of}} the Widal test in the serological diagnosis of typhoid fever. A <b>veronal</b> <b>buffer</b> extract yielded precipitation lines against 50 (96 %) out of 52 sera collected from patients with typhoid but against none out of 62 sera obtained from control subjects who did not have typhoid.

By Widal test the rate of detection in patients' sera was 73 % and the false-positive rate for control sera 16 %. It is concluded that in an area where typhoid is endemic counterimmunoelectrophoresis using <b>veronal</b> <b>buffer</b> extract as the antigen is superior to the Widal test for serological diagnosis of typhoid fever.

40|$|The fine {{structure}} of mitochondria {{revealed by the}} electron microscope was first investigated by Palade (1). Since then a number of serious studies have been made (2 to 6) which have established a general concept of mitochondrial structure.

In the course of an electron microscopic investigation of peripheral human blood conducted in this laboratory by James A.

The following technique, which does not use anticoagulants and does not introduce any foreign substance into the blood prior to fixation, was found by Mr. Freeman to be the most satisfactory. Materials and Methods Normal human blood was obtained by venipuncture either by (a) sterile withdrawal with a 10 cc. silicon-coated 1 syringe fitted with an arquad-coated ~ 20 gauge needle and transference to a 10 cc. lusteroid centrifuge tube (International) precooled to 5 - 10 °C. or (b) by needle drip directly into the tube. The ice-cooled blood sample was centrifuged at 1500 R. p. x~. for 15 minutes at 0 °C. (~. c. ~. = 265 : International model PR- 2, refrigerated, angle head). The buffy coat was aspirated with a silicon-coated pipette and transferred to a glass tube containing 5 cc. of 1 per cent <b>veronal</b> <b>buffered</b> (pH = 7. 4) OsO 4 at 5 - 10 °C.

But when (Mg+Zn), (Mg+Co), (Mg+Ni) and (Mg+Cd) were added, (Mg+Zn) addition showed the highest activation while the others lowered the enzymic action shown when Mg was added singly. 2) The enzymic action was inhibited by a KCN addition or when the dithizone procedure was applied. 3) The same inhibitory action was checked by a Zn addition. 4) Enzyme dialysed with <b>veronal</b> <b>buffer</b> solution showed only a slight activity, but was activated by the addition of the above mentioned metal ions, especially Mg and (Mg+Zn).

The activity of partially inactivated virus in distilled water and in saline solutions was increased ten to 1000 times by diluting such solutions with 0. 1 M phosphate buffer. Some reactivation was also effected with veronal but not with borate buffers...|$|E
40|$|Simple {{and rapid}} methods of {{determining}} plasma proteins, which yield results comparing favorably with those obtained by electrophoresis, have been sought by several investigators. The procedure of Mime seemed {{of particular interest}} to us, since it differs from the widely used one of Howe only with respect to the concentrations of sodium sulfate employed. The dual {{purpose of the present study}} was, first, to secure an additional series of normal values for serum proteins determined by the method of Milne, and second, to ascertain whether his reported agreement between salt fractionation and electrophoretic separation of serum applies to knee joint fluid. A component moving more rapidly than albumin was noted in all knee joint fluids examined, and was studied further by means of electrophoresis-convection (1). MATERIALS AND METHODS Blood samples were drawn from the cubital vein, during mid-morning, from 16 apparently normal staff members who were seated during vene-puncture. About an hour after clotting, serum was separated bycentrifuga-tion. Analyses were made in duplicate or triplicate by the method of Mime. Knee joint fluids were brought to the laboratory shortly after aspira-tions had been performed in the Arthritis Clinic of the Hospital. <b>Veronal</b> <b>buffer,</b> pH 8. 6 and ionic strength 0. 1, was used in electrophoretic studies...|$|E

Various heating menstrua included 0. 04 M <b>Veronal</b> <b>buffer</b> (pH 7. 4), beef broth, and fractions of beef broth obtained by ultrafiltration or precipitation with ammonium sulfate. The toxin was assayed serologically using the microslide gel double-diffusion method. The time requiring for 90 % inactivation at 110 degrees C (D 110 value) obtained in buffer and in beef broth was 18 and 60 min, respectively. When the concentration of beef broth was increased fivefold, the D 110 increased to 78 min. The apparent protective effect or protein was further investigated using beef broth protein obtained by precipitation with (NH 4) 2 SO 4. The D 110 values were 51 and 70 min when the protein concentration in the heating menstruum was 3. 8 and 7. 7 mg/ml, respectively. However, when the beef broth protein was dialyzed against buffer before use as a heating menstrum, the D 110 was only 39 or 41 min at comparable protein concentrations. Results indicated a dialyzable factor, whose protective effect was partially destroyed by trypsin and chymotrypsin but did not by disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate, {{was involved in the}} protection of enterotoxin B during heating...|$|E
40|$|In a {{preceding}} paper (Hofstee, 1958 a) it {{was shown}} that with the Na-salts of n-fatty acid esters of m-hydroxybenzoic acid as the substrates for serum cholinesterase an unusually high acti-vation is obtained by certain bivalent metal ions, e. g., Ca. The mechanism of this activa-tion is the main subject of the present investiga-tion. The enzyme is inhibited by phenothiazine derivatives (Courvoisier et at., 1953; Todrick, 1954), e. g., chlorpromazine (Erd#{ 246 }set a!., 1956). Investigation of this inhibition has been included here because {{it was found that}} it is reversed by Ca. A possible mechanism of action of these activators and inhibitors was derived from the kinetics of systems in which the concentration of one of the components (activator, inhibitor or substrate) was varied and that of the others kept constant.

40|$|Immune haemolysis was {{studied with}} {{the two types of}} genetically {{controlled}} sheep erythrocytes (E) which contain either high potassium (K) and low sodium (Na) (HK E) or low K and high Na (LK E). It was found that the susceptibility of HK and LK E to lysis by guinea-pig and human complement is influenced by the cationic environment. In <b>veronal</b> <b>buffer</b> containing 0. 140 M sodium, caesium, choline or Tris, HK E were less susceptible to immune lysis than LK E. No difference was observed in potassium and in lithium(Li). Immune lysis of HK E was stimulated by the cationic series: K>Li>Rb>Cs>Na. Immune lysis of LK E was less dependent on the cationic environment, but K had a slight stimulatory effect. HK and LK E had similar reactivity with haemolytic antibody and in immune adherence. The enhancing effect of potassium was demonstrable upon E* (an erythrocyte which has been damaged by complement but has not yet undergone lysis), suggesting that the cationic effect is produced in the final steps of immune lysis. The data suggest that the different reactivity of HK and LK E with complement in a sodium medium might be independent of the cationic permeability properties of the membrane. Inhibition of active transport by ouabain did not modify the reactivity of HK and LK E with complement in a sodium medium...|$|E
40|$|T WAS RECENTLY CLAIMED (1) that by paper chromatographic methods the hemoglobins {{prepared}} from {{a variety}} of human bloods-of nor-mal adults, of the umbilical cord, and of subjects with sickle-cell anemia or Mediterranean anemia-could each be resolved into a number of molecular species. The methods employed involved the use, as solvents, of aqueous solutions of sucrose and salts, of pyri-dine and of n-butanol-acetic acid-water mixtures, alone in one-dimen-sional runs and in various combinations in two-dimensional runs, with filter paper as the sheet support. In consequence of the persistent difficulties we had experienced in endeavoring to resolve hemoglobin mixtures by the methods of paper electrophoresis with incidental evaporation (2) and ion-exchange chromatography (3, 4), we decided to explore the potentialities of the paper chromatographic methods, more especially those involving the use of aqueous sucrose and buffer solutions. METHOD The hemoglobin solutions (which provided the initial spots) were prepared from heparinized blood samples, either by freezing and thawing to yield plasmolyzed whole blood, or by cytolyzing with water (with or without addition of toluene) the cells first separated by centrifugation and washing with isotonic saline, and then filtering or centrifuging the mixture.

Furthermore, Pillemer and coworkers have demonstrated (5, 6) that properdin is involved in the reaction between zymosan and the complement component, C' 3, a system which is amenable to study in ~tro. These workers have proposed an assay for properdin in which dilutions of test serum, zymosan, and RP t are incubated together, after which residual C' 3 is determined. Since little information was available as to the nature of the reaction, it was explored, utilizing a new and more precise technique for determining residual C' 3.

40|$|Electrophoretic {{patterns}} of normal dog plasma in <b>veronal</b> <b>buffer</b> at pH 8. 5 are {{shown to be}} essentially similar to {{patterns of}} human plasma. Dog albumin has a higher mobility than human albumin and {{in a mixture of}} dog and human plasmas migrates as a partially separated peak. Normal dog plasma frequently shows four alpha globulin peaks. Rates of restoration of plasma protein components in dogs subjected to acute plasmapheresis have been studied by electrophoresis. During the first 24 hours following such acute depletion, appreciable quantities of all electrophoretic components of the plasma proteins enter the circulating blood stream even when food is not given and has not been given for 12 hours before plasmapheresis. In such fasting periods albumin and total globulin appear in approximately the proportions present in normal plasma. Alpha and beta globulins continue relatively elevated during subsequent days in which caloric and protein intakes are adequate for weight and nitrogen gains. Initial albumin levels, however, are regained more slowly than those of total globulin. The relative proportions of the electrophoretic components of plasma proteins may be disturbed from normal following a single acute depletion for as long as 2 to 3 weeks after the total protein level has returned to normal. Abnormally high beta globulin and fibrinogen, but a low albumin, were found in a dog with an acute and chronic cholangitis and hepatitis. Similar elevation of gamma globulin was noted in a dog in which a hemolytic reaction occurred...|$|E
