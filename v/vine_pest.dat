This paper deals with carabid populations within vineyards. Objectives. The objectives were {{to evaluate the}} effects of ground cover management on carabid populations and to understand the potential of these beetles as predators of some grapevine pests. Method. Two vineyards, located in Geneva (Switzerland), were sampled with 60 pitfall traps. Observations were carried out from March to October 2014 and a botanical survey {{was carried out in}} June. Results. In total, 951 carabids belonging to 36 species were captured in the two vineyards. Bare ground and poor plant species treated with herbicides reduced the abundance of the ground beetles. On the other hand, ground covered with spontaneous vegetation, rather than a mixture of seeds, seemed to favor ground beetles throughout the sampling period. Conclusions. The peak activity of the potential predatory beetles corresponded to the occurrence of some <b>vine</b> <b>pests.</b> However, the most common carabid species captured had an omnivorous diet and a low potential for pest predation on viticulture.

The beans provide the nitrogen to the soil that the other plants use, and the squash spreads along the ground, blocking the sunlight, helping prevent the establishment of weeds. The squash leaves also act as a [...] "living mulch", creating a microclimate to retain moisture in the soil, and the prickly hairs of the <b>vine</b> deter <b>pests.</b> Corn, beans, and squash contain complex carbohydrates, essential fatty acids and all eight essential amino acids, allowing most Native American tribes to thrive on a plant-based diet.|$|R
40|$|Grapevine leafroll {{disease in}} New Zealand is {{predominantly}} {{caused by the}} ampelovirus GLRaV- 3, which is vectored between vines by up to three species of mealybugs (Pseudococcus spp.). However, global understanding of the transmission and spread of GLRaV- 3 remains limited, and does not definitively show how to successfully manage the disease in New Zealand. The disease is a manifestation of a complex relationship between the virus, vine and vectors, each component of which is interdependent on the other two. The review suggests that {{a full understanding of}} the disease will require research and operational input from plant virologists, entomologists, <b>vine</b> physiologists, <b>pest</b> controllers, vineyard managers, grapevine breeders/improvers and winemakers. Such a wide range of expertise should ensure that the factors behind the spread of the disease over time (its epidemiology) are accurately determined, and that effective management solutions are delivered over the course of decades...|$|R

50|$|He then {{played an}} important, but little known role in rescuing the French wine industry. In the 1870s French {{vineyards}} {{came under attack}} by a small insect, Phylloxera vastatrix, an aphid-like pest which sucks sap from the roots of grape vines. Growers observed that certain imported American <b>vines</b> resisted this <b>pest,</b> and the French government dispatched a scientist to St. Louis to consult with the Missouri state entomologist and with Engelmann, who had studied American grapes since the 1850s. Engelmann verified that certain living American species had resisted Phylloxera for nearly 40 years. In addition, Vitis riparia, a wild vine of the Mississippi Valley, did not cross pollinate with less resistant species, the cause of previous grafting failures. Engelmann arranged to have millions of shoots and seeds collected and sent to France, where the species proved to be very successful in providing rootstock.|$|R
25|$|The {{annual growth}} cycle of grapevines {{is the process}} {{that takes place in}} the {{vineyard}} each year, beginning with bud break in the spring and culminating in leaf fall in autumn followed by winter dormancy. From a winemaking perspective, each step in the process plays a vital {{role in the development of}} grapes with ideal characteristics for making wine. Viticulturalists and vineyard managers monitor the effect of climate, <b>vine</b> disease and <b>pests</b> in facilitating or impeding the vines progression from bud break, flowering, fruit set, veraison, harvesting, leaf fall and dormancy-reacting if need be with the use of viticultural practices like canopy management, irrigation, vine training and the use of agrochemicals. The stages of the annual growth cycle usually become observable within the first year of a vine's life. The amount of time spent at each stage of the growth cycle depends on a number of factors-most notably the type of climate (warm or cool) and the characteristics of the grape variety.|$|R
40|$|People may be {{significant}} vectors for <b>vine</b> diseases and <b>pests.</b> Yet despite the potential biosecurity risks of visitation few New Zealand wineries have biosecurity strategies in place. The paper therefore {{aims to examine}} biosecurity threats to wineries in terms of first, visitor understanding of terms used in customs declaration and their relation to their perception of vineyards; and second, the behaviours of winery visitors. In order to undertake an exploratory assessment of biosecurity risks associated with wine tourism a short convenience survey was undertaken of winery visitors in the Canterbury, Marlborough and Central Otago wine regions of the South Island of New Zealand in January-March 2002. The survey had 324 respondents of which 69 were international visitors. The demographic profile of respondents was similar to previous profiles of New Zealand wine tourists. The results indicated that relatively few respondents recognised a vineyard as a farm therefore raising concerns {{about the extent to}} which present customs forms may identify winery or vineyard visits. Of equal concern was the extent to which the same clothing items are used from one winery visit to another, and on different trips. The paper concludes by noting the urgent need to develop more appropriate biosecurity strategies for wineries and vineyards in the light of the development of wine tourism...|$|R
40|$|Vineyards {{worldwide}} occupy over 7 {{million hectares}} and are typically virtual monocultures, with high and costly inputs {{of water and}} agro-chemicals. Understanding and enhancing ecosystem services can reduce inputs and their costs and help satisfy market demands for evidence of more sustainable practices. In this New Zealand work, low-growing, endemic plant species were evaluated for their potential benefits as Service Providing Units (SPUs) or Ecosystem Service Providers (ESPs). The services provided were weed suppression, conservation of beneficial invertebrates, soil moisture retention and microbial activity. The potential Ecosystem Dis-services (EDS) from the selected plant species by hosting the larvae of a key <b>vine</b> moth <b>pest,</b> the light-brown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana), was also quantified. Questionnaires were used to evaluate winegrowers’ perceptions {{of the value of}} and problems associated with such endemic plant species in their vineyards. Growth and survival rates of the 14 plant species, in eight families, were evaluated, with Leptinella dioica (Asteraceae) and Acaena inermis ‘purpurea’ (Rosaceae) having the highest growth rates in terms of area covered and the highest survival rate after 12 months. All 14 plant species suppressed weeds, with Leptinella squalida, Geranium sessiliforum (Geraniaceae), Hebe chathamica (Plantaginaceae), Scleranthus uniflorus (Caryophyllaceae) and L. dioica, each reducing weed cover by > 95 %. Plant species also differed in the diversity of arthropods that they supported, with the Shannon Wiener diversity index (H′) for these taxa ranging from 0 to 1. 3. G. sessiliforum and Muehlenbeckia axillaris (Polygonaceae) had the highest invertebrate diversity. Density of spiders was correlated with arthropod diversity and G. sessiliflorum and H. chathamica had the highest densities of these arthropods. Several plant species associated with higher soil moisture content than in control plots. The best performing species in this context were A. inermis ‘purpurea’ and Lobelia angulata (Lobeliaceae). Soil beneath all plant species had a higher microbial activity than in control plots, with L. dioica being highest in this respect. Survival proportion to the adult stage of the moth pest, E. postvittana, on all plant species was poor (< 0. 3). When judged by a ranking combining multiple criteria, the most promising plant species were (in decreasing order) G. sessiliflorum, A. inermis ‘purpurea’, H. chathamica, M. axillaris, L. dioica, L. angulata, L. squalida and S. uniflorus. Winegrowers surveyed said that they probably would deploy endemic plants around their vines. This research demonstrates that enhancing plant diversity in vineyards can deliver SPUs, harbour ESPs and therefore deliver ES. The data also shows that growers are willing to follow these protocols, with appropriate advice founded on sound research...|$|R
40|$|In a {{perennial}} culture {{such as the}} vine, late and inaccurate identification of the damage created by diseases and pests can cause significant crop loss or even {{the loss of the}} entire production. To support the growers in Romania, in 2010, we printed and also posted online on www. scvblaj. ro a guide on how to diagnose <b>vine</b> diseases and <b>pests</b> that describes in detail the most important pathogens together with pictures and various solutions in order to help the growers to bring the plants back to a healthy state whenever possible. Given the high number of growers in our country, especially small family growers, the guide is addressed to anyone, regardless of their past experience. Between 2010 and 2014, thousands of growers have accessed the online version of the guide and contacted us to request additional help. We gathered a lot of valuable information during that time but most notably the fact that many growers were contacting us too late, when a disease had already spread beyond any hope of recovery or worse after a wrong treatment was applied because of an inaccurate diagnosis. In recent years we noticed an increasing number of wrong diagnostics of vine diseases and a tendency for pathogens to be more aggressive. Thus finding a new solution, easily accessible to growers that would offer a faster, easier and up to date diagnosis, was necessary. Recent developments in the field of machine learning (Ghahramani, 2015), breakthroughs in computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and the availability of cheap computational hardware has led us to look for a way to automatically detect and classify a disease just by having a computer or a mobile phone process a picture of an affected plant. Given the widespread availability of mobile devices, we believe we can help the vine growers further...|$|R
40|$|Dry matter {{concentration}} (DM%) of {{the fruit}} is a primary indicator of quality for kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.), lower levels being associated with inferior tasting fruit. Carbohydrates and particularly starch, are {{the main component of}} dry matter in the fruit of Actinidia spp. In plants, N fertilisation can reduce carbohydrate levels and increase succulence. Therefore high levels of N fertilisation could reduce fruit DM% by reducing its dry matter accumulation and increasing its water content. High rates of N fertiliser applied to kiwifruit vines (A. deliciosa) over four seasons tended to produce larger fruit (5 % heavier on average over the four seasons) mainly due to increased water content with less effect on total dry matter contents. Consequently DM% was reduced from an average over the four seasons of 16. 1 % in the unfertilised (control vines) to 15. 6 % in fruit from the N fertilised vines. However, vegetative vigour in terms of the weight of shoots was increased by up to 150 % by N fertiliser. Biostimulants applied as foliar sprays and surplus water supplied to the soil appeared to alter the balance between dry matter and water accumulation in the fruit in a similar way to soil-applied N fertiliser. It is concluded that increases in fruit size induced by N fertilisation, biostimulants, surplus water, and even girdling are at least partly due to the creation of increased hydraulic gradients between the vine and fruit leading to increased water uptake by the fruit. Other effects on fruit of high rates of soil-applied N fertiliser included reduced ascorbic acid, oxalate, and epidermal phenolics. Reductions in levels of these compounds and the generally increased succulence of N fertilised vines may increase the susceptibility of the <b>vines</b> to <b>pests</b> and diseases. In contrast to soil-applied N, foliar sprays of N applied during early fruit development stages increased fruit growth with no apparent effect on vegetative vigour. Aqueous solutions (1 % w/v) of both urea and potassium nitrate were effective forms of N for foliar application and could increase fruit fresh weight by between 6 and 10 % depending on the season and number of applications. It is estimated that the use of foliar-applied N during early fruit development could represent an increase in crop value of between $ 3600 and $ 15, 000 per hectare depending on size and yield. Foliar-applied N shows promise as an alternative way to manage the N nutrition of kiwifruit with favourable effects on fruit quality since dry matter accumulation in fruit tended to increase proportionately with increased water uptake. Foliar application of N can also avoid some of the adverse environmental effects associated with the soil application of soluble N fertilisers...|$|R
