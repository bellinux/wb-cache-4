She said the song deals with her {{attempted}} suicide and demanding relationships with her family, and how she wanted to bless people through her personal story and music. During an interview with Rolling Stone, Fantasia said the following about the songs message: [...] "I wanted people to know that Ive been through the rain, I <b>ve</b> <b>been</b> broken into pieces, I had a daughter at such a young age. There were times people would say, Thats it for her, but that didnt happen." [...] Christian Todays Czarina Ong referred to [...] "I Made It" [...] as Fantasias [...] "victory song" [...] and [...] "her song of success". According to Rito P. Asilo of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, the song represents how Fantasia has reconciled with her feelings of [...] "heartbreak, betrayal, and the character-forming pain of rejection and failure".|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{knowledge}} in virtual environments (<b>VE's)</b> <b>is</b> often evaluated using performance measures {{acquired in the}} VE. We show that pointing errors measured in a <b>VE</b> <b>are</b> highly predictive of pointing errors in the real world; however, errors in distance estimations made in a <b>VE</b> <b>are</b> not as predictive of distance errors in the real world. We examine factors that affect bearing and distance estimations made in real vs. virtual environments and find that gender is highly influential. INTRODUCTION In the last decade, there has been considerable interest in using computergenerated environments (virtual environments [...] or VE's) for training spatial knowledge. Because <b>VE's</b> <b>are</b> able to depict threedimensional spaces interactively, they offer a promising medium for training people about the spatial characteristics of places and situations that are rare, remote, or dangerous. For example, <b>VE's</b> can <b>be</b> used to train firefighters about a building's layout before they must enter it {{to put out a}} fire (se [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Virtual {{environment}} (<b>VE)</b> <b>is</b> a prime {{component in}} haptic interaction system. Traditional passive <b>VE</b> <b>is</b> not suitable to model human-machine interaction intelligence in haptic system {{such as a}} virtual tug-of-war system. Novel taxonomy of virtual environment is proposed according to different interaction tasks in physical world. Based on the difference between passive and active <b>VE,</b> intelligent <b>VE</b> <b>is</b> defined as a special type of nonlinear and active VE. The components of intelligent <b>VE</b> <b>are</b> identified and challenges within modeling and rendering method are discussed. Based on a one-dimensional haptic device, a virtual tug-of-war prototype is developed and different rendering algorithms are compared. Experiment results illustrate that the intelligent VE enhance the fidelity of the tug-of-war process and the rendering algorithm could ensure stability of the haptic system. The developed prototype can be utilized in entertainment areas. 1...|$|R
