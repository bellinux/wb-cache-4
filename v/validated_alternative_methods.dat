40|$|Tests with {{vertebrates}} are {{an integral}} part of environmental hazard identification and risk assessment of chemicals, plant protection products, pharmaceuticals, biocides, feed additives and effluents. These tests raise ethical and economic concerns and are considered as inappropriate for assessing all of the substances and effluents that require regulatory testing. Hence, there is a strong demand for replacement, reduction and refinement strategies and methods. However, until now alternative approaches have only rarely been used in regulatory settings. This review provides an overview on current regulations of chemicals and the requirements for animal tests in environmental hazard and risk assessment. It aims to highlight the potential areas for alternative approaches in environmental hazard identification and risk assessment. Perspectives and limitations of alternative approaches to animal tests using vertebrates in environmental toxicology, i. e. mainly fish and amphibians, are discussed. Free access to existing (proprietary) animal test data, availability of <b>validated</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> and a practical implementation of conceptual approaches such as the Adverse Outcome Pathways and Integrated Testing Strategies were identified as major requirements towards the successful development and implementation of alternative approaches.

40|$|AbstractFor live, {{attenuated}} vaccines {{derived from}} neurotropic wild-type viruses, regulatory authorities require neurovirulence safety testing, typically using monkeys, {{to assure the}} absence of residual neurotoxicity. Ethical concerns surrounding the use of nonhuman primates in product testing, coupled with questions over its predictive value, {{has resulted in a}} concerted effort to replace monkey-based neurovirulence safety testing with more informative, <b>validated</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> that include the use of lower animal species (e. g., mice and rats) and/or in vitro assays such as mutation analysis by PCR and restriction enzyme cleavage (MAPREC). MAPREC is a WHO-approved screening tool to assess reversion to neurovirulence of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). Monitoring the genetic consistency of OPV lots by identification and quantification of the mutational profile using the recently developed technology of massively parallel sequencing (MPS) also holds promise not only as a replacement for nonhuman primate testing of OPV lots but for other vaccines for which animal-based tests are currently performed as a measure of manufacturing consistency and freedom of adventitious virus contamination. In many cases, the greatest hurdle to availability of such alternative methods has been the process rather than the science.

40|$|International audienceThe new European {{regulation}} of chemicals REACH aiming {{to reinforce the}} control of risks from chemicals in Europe entered into force in 2007. It may require the reassessment of hazardous properties for up to 140000 substances. However, the complete experimental characterization of (eco) toxicological and physico-chemical properties is time-consuming, costly and sometimes not feasible at the R&D stage. Therefore, the development of <b>validated</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> for assessing hazardous properties of chemicals is promoted in REACH. Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships (QSPR), already used extensively in biological and toxicological applications to reduce unnecessary animal testing, are now also developed to predict physico-chemical properties. The present work focuses on the development and validation of QSPR models to predict the impact sensitivity of potentially explosive molecules (nitroaromatics, nitroaliphatics and nitramines, [...] .). To set up appropriate relationships between different molecular descriptors of these compounds and their impact sensitivity, an original approach associating the QSPR method to quantum chemical calculations was developed. More than 300 molecular descriptors (constitutional, topological, geometrical, quantum chemical) were calculated using CodessaPro software from calculated molecular structures, optimized with the Density Functional Theory (DFT) in GaussianO 3 package. These descriptors were integrated into statistical multilinear regressions to link them quantitatively to the experimental impact sensitivity property. Projection and classification methods (PCA, PLS, decision trees) were also used, notably {{for the development of}} qualitative models. When enough experimental data became available, models were developed on a training dataset and were validated according to the OECD principles for the use ofQSPRs in a regulatory context. Once validated, models are expected to be integrated into a global tool to estimate explosibility hazards of substances (for classification purposes) and the need for further experimental testin...|$|E
40|$|The {{immune system}} is one {{important}} target of xenobiotic toxicity. In fact, immunotoxicity evaluation is becoming {{a growing concern for}} international regulatory authorities. At present, immunotoxicity of chemicals is evaluated through standard toxicity studies (STS) on laboratory animals. European Union legislation aims at reducing the number of animals used for experiments, encouraging the development of alternative methods. Since <b>validated</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> to evaluate immunotoxicity are not available, except for the CFU-GM (granulocyte macrophage-colony forming unit) test, this study has been developed {{on the basis of these}} objectives: 1. Determination of the predictivity of a set of in vitro assays, to evaluate suppressive potential on lymphocyte activation of compounds known for their effects on the immune system; 2. Developing a long-term culture method (LTC) using human mononuclear bone marrow cells to assess effects of chemicals on lymphopoiesis in vitro; 3. Performing a preliminary evaluation of the LTC developed, using the organotin compound tri-butyltin chloride (TBTC), which is known for its immunosuppressive activity in rats. We evaluated the capability of some in vitro tests to classify a panel of compounds known for their immunosuppressive effects. The tests were performed on human, rat and murine cells. Different endpoints were assessed: cytotoxicity, cytokine release, myelotoxicity and mitogen responsiveness. IC 50 s values were calculated and results compared by species. In vitro tests performed well in classifying the selected compounds, confirming that it is necessary to investigate different end-points to study immunosuppression. Most methods available use mature immune system cells. Since there are no methods to study toxicity on lymphoid progenitors, we developed a long term culture (LTC) from human bone marrow mononuclear cells to maintain lymphopoiesis. The LTC consisted of a two stages: a myeloid stage to allow the formation of a stromal layer and a lymphoid stage to allow expansion of lymphocytes. Results show that the use of IL- 7 in LTC inhibits precursor and mature B cells, while it supports the proliferation of CD 3 +CD 8 + and CD 3 +CD 4 + T-cells. TBTC was tested on LTC method to verify if this culture system could be useful in the chemical toxicity characterization. TBTC induced adipocyte differentiation causing an alteration of the stromal cellular components, and it reduced the expression of some cytokines and of leptin, which is important for lymphopoiesis. To verify if TBTC can really reduce lymphocyte population, some B and T cell subsets were analyzed. Some cytokines important for lymphopoiesis, whose production was inhibited by TBTC, were tested to verify if they can prevent TBTC toxicity on lymphocytes. FACS analysis showed a reduction of CD 19 /CD 22 -positive B cells by TBTC, both in the presence or absence of cytokines. The treatment did not cause a toxic effect on mature CD 3 +CD 4 + and CD 3 +CD 8 + T cells, suggesting selective TBTC toxicity on B lymphocytes. TBTC caused an alteration of the stromal microenvironment inducing adipocyte differentiation and reducing the production of different cytokines, withdrawing the culture of essential components for B lymphopoiesis. A direct TBTC toxic activity on lymphocytes is also possible, but the mechanism of action should be still explained...|$|E

40|$|The 7 th Amendment of the Cosmetics Directive (76 / 768 /EEC) set up clear {{timelines}} for {{banning the}} animal testing {{and marketing of}} cosmetic products and their ingredients tested on animals. For most of the human health effects, including acute toxicity, the deadline is March 2009. Therefore, the European Centre for the Validation of <b>Alternative</b> <b>Methods</b> (ECVAM) is recently putting considerable effort into developing and <b>validating</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> {{in the area of}} acute toxicity. The large Integrated Project ACuteTox, funded by the European Commission¿s 6 th Framework Programme, started in 2005 with the aim of developing and pre-validating a testing strategy to fully replace acute oral toxicity testing in vivo. As a follow-up to the international validation study on the prediction of acute toxicity by cytotoxicity assays and taking into consideration the high prevalence of non-toxic substances in the New Chemicals Database (87 % with LD 50 > 2000 mg/kg) ECVAM has commissioned a validation study in which 56 industrial chemicals (of which 60 % cosmetic ingredients) are tested to assess the predictive capacity of the validated 3 T 3 /Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) cytotoxicity assay to discriminate between toxic/hazardous (LD 50 2000 mg/kg) substances. The validated protocol of the test was established on the robotic testing facility at the Institute for Health and Consumer Protection and this automated version is under evaluation using the same set of chemicals. A third laboratory in the US is assessing an abbreviated version of the validated 3 T 3 /NRU protocol, which is less costly and more industry-friendly. Despite all these efforts, it is unlikely that validated and regulatory accepted <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> and/or strategies for acute toxicity will be available in March 2009. Thus, following the initiatives undertaken by the pharmaceutical industry to waive the acute oral toxicity testing before going to clinical studies by using information from other in vivo studies, ECVAM proposed an approach to identify non-toxic compounds (LD 50 > 2000 mg/kg) using information from 28 -days repeated dose toxicity studies. A Non Observed Adverse Effect Level threshold was set that allowed the correct identification of 63 % of non-toxic compounds, while only less then 1 % of harmful compounds were misclassified as non-toxic. Since repeated dose toxicity studies can be performed in vivo until 2013, the proposed approach could have an immediate impact for the testing of cosmetic ingredients. JRC. DDG.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{analysis}} of the accuracy and efficiency of different approaches for the simulation of photonic crystals using the transmission line matrix method. The approaches that we present can be divided into two categories: complex- and real-valued algorithms using a uniform mesh, and complex- and real-valued algorithms using a multigrid mesh. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are discussed and a brief comparison between these methods is made from the points of view of computational expense and accuracy. It is found that a combination of a real-valued method in a multigrid mesh results in the most efficient algorithm. However, while the complex-valued formulation is valid for the analysis of any photonic crystal, the applicability of the real-valued formulation is limited by structural constraints requiring cell symmetries. It is also found that a multigrid approach can considerably reduce the computational cost required for simulating photonic crystals and our results indicate that a good compromise between accuracy and computational cost can be found.

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} is {{focussed}} on obtaining fast, e cient solutions to the Schroedinger-Poisson model of electron states in microelectronic devices. The self-consistent solution of the coupled system of Schroedinger-Poisson equations poses many challenges. In particular, the three-dimensional solution is computationally intensive resulting in long simulation time, prohibitive memory requirements and considerable computer resources such as parallel processing and multi-core machines. Consequently, an approximate analytical solution for the coupled system of Schroedinger-Poisson equations is investigated. Details of the analytical techniques for the approximate solution are developed and the original approach is outlined. By introducing the hyperbolic secant and tangent functions with complex arguments, the coupled system of equations is transformed into one for which an approximate solution is much simpler to obtain. The method solves Schroedinger's equation rst by approximating the electrostatic potential in Poisson's equation and subsequently uses this solution to solve Poisson's equation.

Results revealed little use of quantitative animal or human kinetic data in risk evaluations of food chemicals, compared with pesticides and medicines. Risk evaluations of medicines provided sufficient in vivo kinetic data from different species to evaluate the predictive value of animal kinetic data for humans. These data showed a relatively poor correlation between the in vivo bioavailability in rats and dogs versus that in humans. In contrast, in vitro (human) kinetic data have been demonstrated to provide adequate predictions of the fate of compounds in humans, using appropriate in vitro-in vivo scalers and by integration of in vitro kinetic data with in silico kinetic modelling.

The performance standards include essential test method components, a minimum list of reference substances, and standards for accuracy and reliability. Essential test method components are the structural, functional, and procedural elements of a validated test method that must be included in a modified method in order for it to be evaluated using the established performance standards. Essential components of the LLNA include topical application of the test substance to the ears of mice, measurement of lymphocyte proliferation in the lymph nodes draining the area of test substance application, and use of the maximum soluble dose that does not result in systemic toxicity or excessive local irritation. The minimum list of reference substances for these LLNA performance standards includes 13 sensitizers and 5 nonsensitizers. The accuracy and reliability standards to be achieved by a modified LLNA are based on the performance of the traditional LLNA. These LLNA performance standards will facilitate rapid and efficient validation of modified LLNA protocols, such as those using non-radioactive markers of lymphocyte proliferation. New versions of the LLNA that provide improved performance or other advantages are expected to result in broader use of the LLNA, which will further reduce and refine animal use for allergic contact dermatitis assessments while ensuring human safety.

40|$|Toxicity risk {{assessment}} {{for human health}} mainly relies on data obtained from animal experimentation and human experimental studies and epidemiology. <b>Validated</b> <b>alternative</b> test <b>methods</b> are required for safety toxicology of drugs and chemicals. Studies have demonstrated that there is ~ 70 % correlation between in vitro cytotoxic concentracions and in vivo LD 50 or human lethal concentracions. Multiple reasons may account for this failing to predict acute toxicity in 20 – 30 % of the tested chemicals: i) chemical metabolism, ii) barrier passage, iii) biokinetics and iv) organ-specific toxicity (neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, etc). The nervous system is particularly vulnerable to chemical exposure; its complexity results in multiple potential target sites with different toxicity demonstration. We are developing a neurotoxicity testing strategy that could identify factors to improve the correlation between in vitro data and human acute toxicity and alerts for the identification of outliers. A set of pharmaceutical, industrial, biocide and drug abuse chemicals have been tested against GABAA receptor activity, GABA and glutamate transport, acetylcholinaesterase activity and membrane potential in primary neuronal cultures, {{in the frame of}} the European project AcuteTox. GABAA receptor-mediated chloride influx was inhibited by compounds for which seizures have been observed after severe human poisoning. Abuse drugs inhibit [3 H]GABA uptake but not [3 H]aspartate uptake. Exposure to organophosphorus compounds for 48 hours resulted in higher inhibition of acetylcholinaesterase activity than shorter exposure for 30 – 60 minutes, suggesting that primary cortical neurons have metabolic capacity. Most neurotoxic compounds altered membrane potential. Cell viability was not reduced at concentrations that were effective against neuronal endpoints. Acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acid did not modify any of the endpoints assayed. These results show that in vitro evaluation of neural endpoints may identify compounds that produce acute neurotoxicity in humans, provided that relevant in vitro models for acute neural disfunctions are used.

It enables the simultaneous determination of ten pesticides in mango fruits. The fiber used was polydimethylsiloxane while optimum SPME conditions employed have been developed and optimized in a previous work. The desorption process was performed in static mode, using acetonitrile as a solvent. The {{results indicate that the}} DI-SPME/HPLC/UV–Vis procedure resulted in good linear range, accuracy, precision and sensibility and is adequate for analyzing pesticide residues in mango fruits. The limits of detection (0. 6 – 3. 3 [*]μg/kg) and quantification (2. 0 – 10. 0 [*]μg/kg) were achieved with values lower than the maximum residue levels (MRLs) established by Brazilian legislation for all pesticides in this study. The average recovery rates obtained for each pesticide ranged from 71. 6 to 104. 3 % at three fortification levels, with the relative standard deviation ranging from 4. 3 to 18. 6 %. The proposed method was applied for the determination of the aforementioned compounds in commercial mango samples and residues of azoxystrobin, fenthion, permethrin, abamectin and bifenthrin were detected in the mango samples, although below the MRLs established by Brazilian legislation...|$|R

The detection of food hazards in foods is performed by several tests that produce results {{dependent on the}} analytical method used: an analytical reference method, defined as standard, is associated with each microbiological criterion laid down in Regulation 2073 / 2005 /EC, but, analytical methods other than the reference ones, in particular more rapid methods, could be used. Combined screening methods performed by real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are currently <b>validated</b> as <b>alternative</b> <b>methods</b> according to the ISO 16140 : 2003 and certified by the Association Française de Normalisation. However, the positive results obtained with these <b>alternative</b> <b>methods,</b> the investigated molecular relations that resulted positive have to be confirmed with cultural methods using the same enrichment media in which the molecular screening was performed. Since {{it is necessary to}} assess if these testing schemes provide equivalent guarantees of food safety, the aim of this retrospective study is to analyse the data collected, from 2012 to 2014 by Emilia Romagna Region in the field of Piano Regionale Alimenti (Food Regional Plan) during official controls monitoring food samples of animal and other than animal origin. Records performed by combined methods of molecular screening of Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes and thermophilic Campylobacter and cultural confirmation results were gathered together and the results were compared in order to assess the sensitivity of the methods. A total of 10, 604 food samples were considered in this study: the comparison of the data revealed that the RT-PCR method detected Salmonella, L. monocytogenes, and thermophilic Campylobacter in 2. 18, 3. 85 and 3. 73 % of the samples, respectively, whereas by using cultural method these pathogens were isolated in 0. 43, 1. 57 and 1. 57 % of samples, respectively. In spite of the use of the same enrichment broth, the RT-PCR method disclosed a percentage of positive samples that was negative to cultural examination ranging between 20 and 43 %, with a PCR/culture ratio between 2. 37 to 5. 00. In conclusion, {{the results of this study}} pose a doubt about the sensitivity of the official cultural methods regarding the isolation of the three investigated foodborne pathogens. Moreover this study may be a useful tool for veterinary authorities to assess appropriate sampling plans to control the risk relating to the consumption of contaminated foods...|$|R
40|$|A newly adapted {{temperature}} measurement technique is presented for measuring aerospace relevant high surface temperatures. A comparatively cheap, available digital single-lens reflex camera {{is used as}} the imaging system for a two-color ratio pyrometry technique. This provides a highly spatially resolved imaging system that uses the blue, green, and red pixels for the ratio pyrometry measurements. At the Centre for Hypersonics at the University of Queensland, a Canon EOS 400 D camera was spectrally calibrated using a tungsten filament lamp and a monochromator. With {{the knowledge of the}} spectral response of the pixels, emission ratio calculations determining the temperature can be undertaken for images of any surface, which fulfills the requirement of radiating as a gray body. For this particular camera, the measurable temperature limits were determined to be between approximately 1500 and 3000 K. Two tests cases are presented demonstrating the use ofthis technique: first, aheated carbon-carbon sample tested in the X 2 expansion tube, and second, a material sample in a plasma torch. In both cases, the {{temperature measurement}}s were <b>validated</b> using an <b>alternative</b> <b>method</b> of measurement, and the two-color ratio pyrometry measured temperatures were found to be within 5 % of the alternative measurement. This technique provides a highly spatially resolved, yet comparatively cheap method of temperature measurement for high-temperature surfaces such as those encountered in the aerospace field. It is anticipated that this technique can help provide more detailed information of the surface state during future aerospace testing...|$|R
40|$|Sound {{propagation}} outdoors can {{be strongly}} affected by ground topography. The existence of hills and valleys between a source and receiver {{can lead to}} the shielding or focusing of sound waves. Such effects can result in significant variations in received sound levels. In addition, wind speed and air temperature gradients in the atmospheric boundary layer also play an important role. All of the foregoing factors can become especially important for the case of wind turbines located on a ridge overlooking a valley. Ridges are often selected for wind turbines in order to increase their energy capture potential through the wind speed-up effects often experienced in such locations. In this paper, a hybrid calculation method is presented to model such a case, relying on an analytical solution for sound diffraction around an impedance cylinder and the conformal mapping (CM) Green's function parabolic equation (GFPE) technique. The various aspects of the model have been successfully <b>validated</b> against <b>alternative</b> prediction <b>methods.</b> Example calculations with this hybrid analytical-CM-GFPE model show the complex sound pressure level distribution across the valley and the effect of valley ground type. The proposed method has the potential to include the effect of refraction through the inclusion of complex wind and temperature fields, although this aspect has been highly simplified in the current simulations.
