30|$|This study {{highlights}} {{the relationship between}} student action and the complexity in vocational education as a project based vocational education. The project’s high complexity affects the students’ learning ability to take own decisions in the learning environment. This also affects the students’ motivation and ability to develop competences required to fulfill goals in course syllabuses. So, if the students’ {{are supposed to be}} able to be a part of their own learning the complexity in the task should not be too high.

30|$|For the {{relation}} between vocational identity and the <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> of the apprentices, we found an effect of r[*]=[*]. 25 in support of Hypothesis 6 (Table  4). Vocational identity further correlates with the average grade obtained at the vocational school (r[*]=[*]. 15) and the apprentices’ self-rating of their <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> (r[*]=[*]. 24).

Workplace identity correlates to a lesser extent with the competence tests (r[*]=[*]. 14) and the apprentices’ self-rating of their <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> (r[*]=[*]. 16). The competence tests correlate fairly well with the average grade given by the vocational school teachers (r[*]=[*]. 40) and with the apprentices’ self-rating of their <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> (r[*]=[*]. 33), suggesting high retrograde and concurrent validity of the competence measure.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the issues of headteachers' <b>vocational</b> <b>competences</b> and their needs for {{in-service}} training.

This is also one of the conditions for creating a meaningful career system in schooling and a basis for a systematic further vocational development of headteachers. The thesis suggests a generic top performance profile of headteachers of all school degrees and a structure of their in-service training which corresponds to necessary competence. As a result, this should lead to an improvement of vocational training of headteachers and subsequently to higher quality of schools they manage...|$|E

Methods adopted for this study are observations over student action in a project-based vocational education and focus group interviews with observed students. The result indicates a gap between acquired vocational competence at the project and the related learning goals in the course syllabuses. The developed vocational competence seems more adopted to fit the demands of the building industry rather than the intended course goals.

30|$|There are {{differences}} between the types of <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> gained from a PBVE and those indicated in course syllabuses. The specific project provides opportunities to gain <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> {{in areas that are}} closely connected to the phase of where the project is. The result is that the project is the steering part in PBVE, and the goals related to course syllabuses are overlooked. If that is the situation, the focus on producing these houses is greater than the students’ need to gain <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> according to the goals in course syllabuses. Another issue is the outsourcing of different tasks. If the students are not able to do a task, they cannot develop that competence within the frame of this PBVE. However, if other structures and/or construction solutions in the building process were used, the students might be able to develop competence in the areas that follow those tasks. The students’ <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> is thus adapted to the project, and the students are developing competence in areas that are related to the specific project.|$|R
30|$|This {{study shows}} how PBVE affects the students’ ability to gain <b>vocational</b> <b>competence.</b> The most {{characteristic}} areas are the motivation {{that follows the}} complexity of the project and the <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> that the students are able to develop within the specific project. These areas are displayed in complexity, decision making and motivation, and the possibility of project-based vocational education. As a finishing point of view, the conclusion will address the scope of learning through PBVE.|$|R

With regard to the <b>vocational</b> <b>competences</b> of industrial clerks we focused on ‘operative controlling’, 6 which {{is an important part of}} the curriculum followed by apprentice industrial clerks, as well as being a relevant domain of business administration in general. Further insight was derived from the content analyses of vocational training regulations, textbooks, a survey of workplace demands on employees in controlling departments (in cooperation with the European Competence Center for Applied Research on Medium-Sized Enterprises at the University of Bamberg/Germany; Becker et al. 2012), a diary study on problem solving in office work (Rausch et al. 2015) and an interview study on typical tasks and requirements in the domain of controlling with teachers, workplace trainers, VET students, and employees in the domain of controlling (Eigenmann et al. 2015). The findings from these domain analyses form the basis for the development of authentic problem scenarios. Appendix (Table  6) gives an overview of the studies and main findings during the phase of domain analyses.|$|E
40|$|Intro: Adults, education, Bildung, inequality, lifelong learning, and {{mathematics}} {{are the key}} terms in the chapter written by Schlöglmann. In the 1990 s, {{he was one of}} the pioneers that cultivated the borderland between mathematics education, adult education, and vocational education as a subfield of mathematics education research (see Wedege, 2000). Together with Jungwirth and Maasz at the University of Linz, he conducted a large empirical study exploring “the state of mathematics education within the adult education system in Austria” ((Jungwirth, Maasz, & Schlöglmann, 1995, p. 13). In this study, the authors made an important distinction between courses where mathematics is explicitly taught and courses where mathematical concepts and methods are used implicitly. In order to label the latter they constructed the term “Mathematikhaltige Weiterbildung” (trans. : Mathematics-containing continuing education) presumably to remind people that mathematics in vocational training, as in the workplace itself, is integrated with other subjects and <b>vocational</b> <b>competences.</b> I have claimed that they paved the way, within the scientific domain of mathematics education, for research on vocationally-oriented adult education where mathematics is an integral part (Wedege, 2000) ...|$|E

30|$|As the {{findings}} of this study indicate, there seems to be an issue around decision making about how something should be done. This phenomenon seems to be grounded in the complexity of the houses, where constant problem-solving dilemmas arise along the production. With Vygotskij (1978) ideas about how ZPD is a part of students’ development of learning, these problem-solving dilemmas reduce the students zone of potential development. One issue that affects the ability to gain vocational competence follows the problem-solving dilemmas that result in redoing tasks and the slow progress in the building process. This affect the opportunity to try new tasks and thereby the potential development of vocational competence. The students’ ability to expand their ZPD is reduced. It can be discussed whether the frequency of redoing tasks and the ability to participate in more tasks is coherent with each other in this PBVE. Following Ellström’s (1992) notion that competence is related to the ability to perform a job that is successfully performed, it could be questioned whether a redoing task that is redone because of changes from the site manager or architect can be interpreted as a successful job that enhances the development of <b>vocational</b> <b>competences.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{development}} {{towards a}} knowledge based and service economy {{goes hand in}} hand with far reaching changes in employees’ professional profiles and <b>vocational</b> <b>competences.</b> Even taking into account the huge heterogeneity of skilled labour, one can say that the main line in the development of qualification requirements aims at reducing craftsmanship and enhancing knowledge-based skills. The findings of empirical research on work organisation and qualification requirements of skilled work in the last 3 decades in Germany can be summarized as follows: The job profiles of skilled workers (Facharbeiter, -angestellte) are becoming more and more complex. Individual workers and work teams receive greater responsibility and more autonomy for their work organisation by decentralisation and the establishment of flat hierarchies within firms 6 (Kuhlmann 2013; Kuhlmann and Schumann 2010). Though work experience unquestionably will remain a part of the competence profile, cognitive competences constitute the major share: e.g. analytical and problem-solving competences as well as critical thinking, organizational skills and the ability to communicate and cooperate with people from different departments, disciplines and even foreign countries. Recent studies on new forms of digitalised work (smart factories, Industrie 4.0 in Germany) confirm the trend towards highly cognitive skills in the field of industrial production work (Hirsch-Kreinsen 2014, p.  23  f.). Due to the unbroken upskilling trend, firms have changed their VET-programmes (i.e. dual studies) and patterns of recruitment (hiring more graduates from universities and universities for applied studies).|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the continued relevance of the 16 - 19 business education curriculum in the UK, stimulated by doubts expressed by Thomas (1996), over its continued relevance. We express a concern that business education needs, but is struggling, to respond to significant societal shifts in consumption and production strategies that do not sit easily within traditional theories of business practice currently underpinning 16 - 19 business education. We examine firstly, {{the extent to which}} a formal body of knowledge couched in a modernist discourse of facts and objectivity can cope with the changing and fluid developments in much current business practice that is rooted in the cultural and symbolic. Secondly, the extent to which both academic and <b>vocational</b> <b>competences</b> provide the means for students to develop a framework of critical understanding that can respond effectively to rapidly changing business environments. Findings are based on research conducted jointly by the University of Manchester and the Manchester Institute for Popular Culture at Manchester Metropolitan University. The growth of dynamism of the cultural industries sector - largely micro-businesses and small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) -encapsulates forms of business knowledge, business language and business practice which may not immediately fit with the models provided within business education. Results suggest increasingly reflexive forms of consumption being met by similarly reflexive and flexible modes of production. Our evidence suggests that whilst modernist business knowledge is often the foundation for many 16 - 19 business education courses, these programmes of study/training do not usually reflect the activities of SME and micro-business practitioners in the cultural industries. Given the importance of cultural industries in terms of the production strategies required to meet increasingly reflexive markets, it is suggested that there may be a need to incorporate a postmodern approach to the current content and pedagogy; one that is contextual, cultural and discursive...|$|E

More often outlines strategies and methods for the selection of students, as well as initial and continuing training systems, training of personnel in education. So I believe {{at the level of}} higher education, the specialization of Pedagogic of Primary and Pre-scholar Education a vocational training process, which must have this feature as a starting point in determining the initial training strategies. Main benchmark from which to start the strategy of initial formation of the institutions must be in the future professional space that is the school and of course the new demands arising from pre-school and primary curricula, always changing in recent years. Shaping a milestone enables us to do a hypothetical portrait of the graduate at this specialization. To have a viable strategy, objective, initial training includes a series of requirements for skills, capabilities and competencies. As regards the vocational level, it remains a problem that needs more discussion.

Results: Surveyed subjects considered absolutely necessary to include in the curriculum of physical education being aware that physical education is a subject that directly influences the biological side of the personality of the rising generation, fortunately, being present at pre-school to university cycles. Conclusions: In addition to physical education classes a relatively small percentage practice a sport or physical activity directed or independent. A significant percentage of subjects considered necessary to regularly practice physical exercise despite not practicing for various reasons. Material conditions, quality sporting and its dependencies, convenience and even the attractiveness of the lesson are factors that determine the acceptance of female students to avoid participating in physical education class by avoiding activity often motivated by the presence of chronic disease...|$|E

During the research into the demand for the development of seafaring students’ career self-management skills it was found out that seafaring students are quite well familiar with the particularity of a seafarer’s profession and its content, but students’ preparation for integration into labor market is inadequate.

The Finnish National Board of Education has created two continuing training programmes for vocational teachers, one of which involves studies aimed at increasing <b>vocational</b> teachers’ <b>competence</b> in the world of work (Frisk 2014; Opetushallitus 2014). An investigation of vocational teachers’ participation in so-called working periods showed that the teachers developed up-to-date knowledge about working life and initiated various changes in vocational education, such as developing teaching and learning materials (Eerola 2007). Furthermore, the participating workplaces learned more about vocational education.
