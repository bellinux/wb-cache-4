Dorsal hand <b>vein</b> <b>pattern</b> is an emerging biometric which has attracted the attention of many researchers, of late.

In this work, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) which is a method that has been successfully applied on human faces and hand geometry is applied on the dorsal hand <b>vein</b> <b>pattern.</b> PCA has been used to obtain eigenveins which is a low dimensional representation of <b>vein</b> <b>pattern</b> features.

40|$|To {{investigate}} possible {{roles of}} polar auxin transport in <b>vein</b> <b>patterning,</b> cotyledon and leaf <b>vein</b> <b>patterns</b> were compared for plants grown in medium containing polar auxin transport inhibitors (N- 1 -naphthylphthalamic acid, 9 -hydroxyfluorene- 9 -carboxylic acid, and 2, 3, 5 -triiodobenzoic acid) and in medium containing a less well-characterized inhibitor of auxin-mediated processes, 2 -(p-chlorophynoxy) - 2 -methylpropionic acid. Cotyledon <b>vein</b> <b>pattern</b> was {{not affected by}} any inhibitor treatments, although vein morphology was altered. In contrast, leaf <b>vein</b> <b>pattern</b> was affected by inhibitor treatments. Growth in polar auxin transport inhibitors resulted in leaves that lacked vascular continuity through the petiole and had broad, loosely organized midveins, an increased number of secondary veins, and a dense band of misshapen tracheary elements adjacent to the leaf margin. Analysis of leaf <b>vein</b> <b>pattern</b> developmental time courses suggested that the primary vein did not develop in polar auxin transport inhibitor-grown plants, and that the broad midvein observed in these seedlings resulted from the coalescence of proximal regions of secondary veins.

40|$|The {{formation}} of leaf <b>vein</b> <b>patterns</b> has fascinated biologists for centuries. Transport {{of the plant}} signal auxin has long been implicated in <b>vein</b> <b>patterning,</b> but molecular details have remained unclear. Varied evidence suggests a central role for the plasma-membrane (PM) -localized PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN 1) intercellular auxin transporter of Arabidopsis thaliana in auxin-transport-dependent <b>vein</b> <b>patterning.</b> However, {{in contrast to the}} severe vein-pattern defects induced by auxin transport inhibitors, pin 1 mutant leaves have only mild vein-pattern defects. These defects have been interpreted as evidence of redundancy between PIN 1 and the other four PM-localized PIN proteins in <b>vein</b> <b>patterning,</b> redundancy that underlies many developmental processes. By contrast, we show here that <b>vein</b> <b>patterning</b> in the Arabidopsis leaf is controlled by two distinct and convergent auxin-transport pathways: intercellular auxin transport mediated by PM-localized PIN 1 and intracellular auxin transport mediated by the evolutionarily older, endoplasmic-reticulum-localized PIN 6, PIN 8, and PIN 5. PIN 6 and PIN 8 are expressed, as PIN 1 and PIN 5, at sites of vein formation. pin 6 synthetically enhances pin 1 vein-pattern defects, and pin 8 quantitatively enhances pin 1 pin 6 vein-pattern defects. Function of PIN 6 is necessary, redundantly with that of PIN 8, and sufficient to control auxin response levels, PIN 1 expression, and vein network formation; and the <b>vein</b> <b>pattern</b> defects induced by ectopic PIN 6 expression are mimicked by ectopic PIN 8 expression. Finally, <b>vein</b> <b>patterning</b> functions of PIN 6 and PIN 8 are antagonized by PIN 5 function. Our data define a new level of control of <b>vein</b> <b>patterning,</b> one wit...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} to extract <b>vein</b> <b>patterns</b> from an unclear finger image is proposed. Finger <b>vein</b> <b>pattern</b> {{can be used}} for {{personal}} identification technology. The finger vein image that is captured with infrared light contains not only the <b>vein</b> <b>patterns</b> but also irregular shades and noises.

Therefore, the robustness and the tolerance to the uneven luminance and noises in pattern extraction algorithm are required.

The method is based on special line tracking that starts at various positions. The robustness of the finger vein extraction method against LED intensity fluctuation is tested and the result shows the performance of the method is more robust than the conventional method.

40|$|Difficulty in {{achieving}} peripheral intravenous (N) access {{in some patients}} is a clinical problem. These difficulties may lead to some negative impacts such as fainting, hematoma and pain associated with multiples punctures. As a result, ultrasound and infrared imaging devices {{have been used to}} aid IV access. Although these devices have shown to be able to aid IV access, infrared system {{has not been able to}} produce satisfactorily clear <b>vein</b> <b>patterns</b> and using ultrasound device is time consuming. Therefore, this research focuses on developing a hand vein exposure system with enhanced image of hand <b>vein</b> <b>patterns</b> to aid IV access. It consists of three major sub-systems namely, a hand vein image-acquisition system, image processing component and hand vein image-projection system. The image acquisition system consists of forty eight near-infrared light emitting diode with wavelength of 0. 89 um. The image processing system involves six stages. In the first stage, a noisy hand vein image is filtered using a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) based on standard median filter. In the second stage, a newly proposed technique based on finger-webs and finger-tips characteristics is applied to obtain a larger region of interest (ROl). In the third stage, the ROl images are enhanced using a combination of fuzzy histogram hyperbolization and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization. Then, in the fourth stage, <b>vein</b> <b>patterns</b> are segmented using local adaptive threshold. In the fifth stage, a noisy binary <b>vein</b> <b>patterns</b> are enhanced using a combination of FINN pixel correction, binary median filter and massive noise removal. In the last stage, an enhanced <b>vein</b> <b>patterns</b> are registered into the original hand vein layout.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{reliable}} and robust biometric verification method based on bimodal physiological characteristics of palms, including the palmprint and palm-dorsum <b>vein</b> <b>patterns.</b> The proposed method consists of five steps: (1) automatically aligning and cropping the same region of interest from different palm or palm-dorsum images; (2) applying the digital wavelet transform and inverse wavelet transform to fuse palmprint and <b>vein</b> <b>pattern</b> images; (3) extracting the line-like features (LLFs) from the fused image; (4) obtaining multiresolution representations of the LLFs by using a multiresolution filter; and (5) using a support vector machine to verify the multiresolution representations of the LLFs. The proposed method possesses four advantages: first, both modal images are captured in peg-free scenarios to improve the user-friendliness of the verification device. Second, palmprint and <b>vein</b> <b>pattern</b> images are captured using a low-resolution digital scanner and infrared (IR) camera. The use of low-resolution images results in a smaller database. In addition, the <b>vein</b> <b>pattern</b> images are captured through the invisible IR spectrum, which improves antispoofing. Third, since the physiological characteristics of palmprint and <b>vein</b> <b>pattern</b> images are different, a hybrid fusing rule can be introduced to fuse the decomposition coefficients of different bands. The proposed method fuses decomposition coefficients at different decomposed levels, with different image sizes, captured from different sensor devices. Finally, the proposed method operates automatically and hence no parameters need to be set manually. Three thousand palmprint images and 3000 <b>vein</b> <b>pattern</b> images were collected from 100 volunteers to verify {{the validity of the}} proposed method.

40|$|Several {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed to explain the process of <b>vein</b> <b>pattern</b> formation in plant tissues. The most widely accepted amongst biologists is the canalization hypothesis, derived from pea root and stem experiments. According to this hypothesis, a signal, {{thought to be the}} phytohormone auxin, is transported polarly from cell to cell from the shoot to the root and is canalized progressively into narrow channels of high auxin fluxes that later differentiate to become vascular tissue. In this project, we set out to test whether auxin canalization drives <b>vein</b> <b>pattern</b> formation, using Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with increased auxin transport (max 4 - 1, max 3 - 9, max 2 - 1 and max 1 - 1).

First rosette leaves of 15 plants per genotype were harvested for analysis each day from 7 to 17 days after sowing, giving a total of eight hundred twenty-five leaf samples to analyze.
