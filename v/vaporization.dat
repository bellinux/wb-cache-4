5|$|However, further {{investigations}} {{have led to}} the conclusion that the arsenic content in the groundwater did not differ from that of the local drinking supply, and that the illness reported was likely caused by the <b>vaporization</b> of troilite, a sulfur-bearing compound present within the meteorite in large amounts, which would have melted at relatively low temperatures and high pressures created by such an impact.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 18th century, some {{scientists}} had made correct hypotheses as to comets' physical composition. In 1755, Immanuel Kant hypothesized that comets are composed of some volatile substance, whose <b>vaporization</b> gives rise to their brilliant displays near perihelion. In 1836, the German mathematician Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, after observing streams of vapor during the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1835, proposed that the jet forces of evaporating material could be great enough to significantly alter a comet's orbit, and {{he argued that the}} non-gravitational movements of Encke's Comet resulted from this phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Hapticity {{is a term}} to {{describe}} the coordination {{of a group of}} contiguous atoms of a ligand bound to the central atom; it is indicated by the Greek character eta, η. Yttrium complexes were the first examples of complexes where carboranyl ligands were bound to a d0-metal center through a η7-hapticity. <b>Vaporization</b> of the graphite intercalation compounds graphite–Y or graphite– leads to the formation of endohedral fullerenes such as Y@C82. Electron spin resonance studies indicated the formation of Y3+ and (C82)3− ion pairs. The carbides Y3C, Y2C, and YC2 can be hydrolyzed to form hydrocarbons.|$|E
5|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{physical properties}} of the noble gases are dominated by the weak van der Waals forces between the atoms. The attractive force increases {{with the size of}} the atom {{as a result of the}} increase in polarizability and the decrease in ionization potential. This results in systematic group trends: as one goes down group18, the atomic radius, and with it the interatomic forces, increases, resulting in an increasing melting point, boiling point, enthalpy of <b>vaporization,</b> and solubility. The increase in density is due to the increase in atomic mass.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} of solid astatine is unknown. As an analogue of iodine {{it may have}} an orthorhombic crystalline structure composed of diatomic astatine molecules, and be a semiconductor (with a band gap of 0.7 eV). Alternatively, if condensed astatine forms a metallic phase, as has been predicted, it may have a monatomic face-centered cubic structure. Evidence for (or against) the existence of diatomic astatine (At2) is sparse and inconclusive. Some sources state {{that it does not}} exist, or at least has never been observed, while other sources assert or imply its existence. Despite this controversy, many properties of diatomic astatine have been predicted; for example, its bond length would be 300 ±10 pm, dissociation energy 83.7 ±12.5 kJ·mol−1,, Cl2, Br2, I2, and At2| url=http://theochem.chem.rug.nl/publications/PDF/ft279.pdf| journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics |volume=104 |issue=22|pages=9040–9046| doi=10.1063/1.471636|bibcode= 1996JChPh.104.9040V}} and heat of <b>vaporization</b> (∆Hvap) 54.39 kJ·mol−1. The latter figure means that astatine may (at least) be metallic in the liquid state on the basis that elements with a heat of <b>vaporization</b> greater than ~42 kJ·mol−1 are metallic when liquid; diatomic iodine, with a value of 41.71 kJ·mol−1, falls just short of the threshold figure.|$|E
5|$|Vesta's {{surface is}} covered by {{regolith}} distinct from that found on the Moon or asteroids such as Itokawa. This is because space weathering acts differently. Vesta's surface shows no significant trace of nanophase iron because the impact speeds on Vesta are too low to make rock melting and <b>vaporization</b> an appreciable process. Instead, regolith evolution is dominated by brecciation and subsequent mixing of bright and dark components. The dark component is {{probably due to the}} infall of carbonaceous material, whereas the bright component is the original Vesta basaltic soil.|$|E
5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{commented on the}} {{metallic}} nature {{of some of the}} properties of astatine. Since iodine is a semiconductor in the direction of its planes, and since the halogens become more metallic with increasing atomic number, it has been presumed that astatine would be a metal if it could form a condensed phase. Astatine may be metallic in the liquid state on the basis that elements with an enthalpy of <b>vaporization</b> (∆Hvap) greater than ~42 kJ/mol are metallic when liquid. Such elements include boron, silicon, germanium, antimony, selenium and tellurium. Estimated values for ∆Hvap of diatomic astatine are 50 kJ/mol or higher; diatomic iodine, with a ∆Hvap of 41.71, falls just short of the threshold figure.|$|E
5|$|Lawrencium is {{the final}} member of the {{actinide}} series and is sometimes {{considered to be a}} group 3 element, along with scandium, yttrium, and lutetium, as its filled f-shell is expected to make it resemble the 7th-period transition metals. In the periodic table, it is located {{to the right of the}} actinide nobelium, to the left of the 6d transition metal rutherfordium, and under the lanthanide lutetium with which it shares many physical and chemical properties. Lawrencium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.58), similar to its lighter congener lutetium, though this is not yet known experimentally. The enthalpy of sublimation of lawrencium is estimated to be 352kJ·mol−1, close to the value of lutetium and strongly suggesting that metallic lawrencium is trivalent with the 7s and 6d electrons delocalized, a prediction also supported by a systematic extrapolation of the values of heat of <b>vaporization,</b> bulk modulus, and atomic volume of neighboring elements to lawrencium. Specifically, lawrencium is expected to be a trivalent, silvery metal, easily oxidized by air, steam, and acids, and having an atomic volume similar to that of lutetium and a trivalent metallic radius of 171pm. It is expected to be a rather heavy metal with a density of around 15.6 to 16.6g·cm−3. It is also predicted to have a melting point of around 1900K (1627°C), not far from the value for lutetium (1925K).|$|E

25|$|Post-accident {{analysis}} {{concluded that}} the final control method (i.e., dissipation of the prompt critical state) occurred by means of catastrophic core disassembly: destructive melting, <b>vaporization,</b> and consequent conventional explosive expansion of {{the parts of the}} reactor core where the greatest amount of heat was being produced most quickly. It was estimated that this core heating and <b>vaporization</b> process happened in about 7.5 milliseconds, before enough steam had been formed to shut down the reaction, beating the steam shutdown by a few milliseconds. A key statistic makes it clear why the core blew apart: the reactor designed for a 3 MW power output operated momentarily at a peak of nearly 20 GW, a power density over 6,000 times higher than its safe operating limit.|$|E

25|$|Early {{forms of}} {{distillation}} were batch processes using one <b>vaporization</b> and one condensation. Purity was improved by further distillation of the condensate.

25|$|Flash {{evaporation}} (or partial evaporation) is {{the partial}} <b>vaporization</b> {{that occurs when}} a saturated liquid stream undergoes a reduction in pressure by passing through a throttling valve or other throttling device.

25|$|Water {{and steam}} {{are a common}} fluid used for heat exchange, due to its {{availability}} and high heat capacity, both for cooling and heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. It's especially effective to transport heat through <b>vaporization</b> and condensation of water because of its large latent heat of <b>vaporization.</b> A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are oxidized faster by untreated water and steam. In almost all thermal power stations, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed loop between boiler, steam turbine and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by evaporation in a cooling tower). In the United States, cooling power plants is the largest use of water.|$|E
25|$|Water has a {{high heat}} of <b>vaporization</b> and is {{relatively}} inert, {{which makes it a}} good fire extinguishing fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.|$|E
25|$|The rails need to {{withstand}} enormous repulsive forces during shooting, and these forces {{will tend to}} push them apart {{and away from the}} projectile. As rail/projectile clearances increase, arcing develops, which causes rapid <b>vaporization</b> and extensive damage to the rail surfaces and the insulator surfaces. This limited some early research railguns to one shot per service interval.|$|E
25|$|Aerosol cans {{containing}} 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, when inverted, become effective freeze sprays. Under pressure, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is {{compressed into}} a liquid, which upon <b>vaporization</b> absorbs {{a significant amount}} of thermal energy. As a result, it will greatly lower the temperature of any object it contacts as it evaporates. This can result in frostbite when it contacts skin, as well as blindness upon eye contact.|$|E
25|$|Carboxylic acids tend to {{have higher}} boiling points than water, {{not only because of}} their {{increased}} surface area, but also because of their tendency to form stabilised dimers. Carboxylic acids tend to evaporate or boil as these dimers. For boiling to occur, either the dimer bonds must be broken or the entire dimer arrangement must be vaporised, both of which increase the enthalpy of <b>vaporization</b> requirements significantly.|$|E
25|$|If {{a system}} {{undergoes}} certain phase transformations while being heated, such as melting and <b>vaporization,</b> {{it may be}} observed that {{the temperature of the}} system does not change until the entire sample has completed the transformation.

25|$|Theoretical {{predictions}} of buckyball molecules {{appeared in the}} late 1960s– early 1970s, but they went largely unnoticed. In the early 1970s, the chemistry of unsaturated carbon configurations was studied by a group at the University of Sussex, led by Harry Kroto and David Walton. In the 1980s a technique was developed by Richard Smalley and Robert Curl at Rice University, Texas to isolate these substances. They used laser <b>vaporization</b> of a suitable target to produce clusters of atoms. Kroto realized that by using a graphite target, any carbon chains formed could be studied.
