40|$|Purpose: Although {{functional}} bladder capacity, {{as expressed}} by maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> and other frequency-volume chart parameters, are important determinants of lower urinary tract symptoms, {{to our knowledge}} no population based data are available on changes in <b>voided</b> <b>volume.</b> We determined changes in and determinants of <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> and <b>voiding</b> frequency with advancing age and with time, as measured by frequency-volume charts. Materials and Methods: We performed a longitudinal, population based study in 1, 688 men 50 to 78 years old with followup at 2. 1, 4. 2 and 6. 5 years. Data were obtained using frequency-volume charts for maximum, 24 -hour and average <b>voided</b> <b>volume,</b> and 24 -hour voiding frequency {{as well as physical}} and urological measurements, and self-administered questionnaires. We used a linear mixed effect model to determine factors predicting volume changes. Results: Median maximum and average <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> decreased with time from 400 to 380 and 245 to 240 ml, respectively, and were smaller in older age groups while 24 -hour <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> showed no change. The 24 -hour voiding frequency increased with time and with advancing age. Maximum, 24 -hour and average <b>voided</b> <b>volumes</b> were positively related to alcohol intake.

Materials and Methods We randomly allocated 149 children to 5 groups, namely holding exercises with placebo (group A), holding exercises with oxybutynin (group B), placebo alone (group C), oxybutynin alone (group D) and alarm treatment (controls, group E). Maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> was the greatest <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> from a 48 -hour bladder diary, and holding exercise volume was the greatest volume produced with postponement of voiding after a fluid load, once daily for 4 days. Study medication, holding exercise procedures and alarm treatment were administered for 12 weeks. Results Holding exercises combined with placebo or oxybutynin significantly increased holding exercise <b>volume</b> and maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume,</b> by 25 % (p < 0. 001) and 21 % (p < 0. 01), respectively, in group A, and by 43 % (p < 0. 001) and 41 % (p < 0. 001), respectively, in group B. Medication without holding exercises (groups C and D) did not increase holding exercise <b>volume</b> or maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume,</b> and in these groups oxybutynin was not significantly superior to placebo. A borderline increase in holding exercise volume did not affect maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> in group E. Monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis response was significantly lower with all 4 holding exercise volume modulating treatments (7 %) compared to alarm therapy (73 %). Conclusions In the treatment of children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> can be increased significantly through holding exercises, but not with oxybutynin chloride alone.

40|$|BackgroundA {{reliable}} {{interpretation of}} uroflowmetry depends on adequate <b>voiding</b> <b>volume.</b> Unfortunately, many patients {{may not be}} in a position to <b>void</b> enough <b>volume</b> to allow an effective interpretation. The main objective of this study was to determine how a valuable uroflow rate can be obtained with an inadequate or even no <b>voiding</b> <b>volume.</b> We have tried to develop a new method to predict the actual uroflow rate by adding power Doppler information during transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) in patients who do not have an interpretable <b>voiding</b> <b>volume.</b> Patients and MethodsFifty-five patients with complete uroflowmetry and TRUS with power Doppler study were enrolled. Analyses of the uroflowmetry and power Doppler parameters were performed. Correlation coefficients were calculated to reveal the relationships among these parameters. ResultsThe correlation coefficient between the prostate intracapsular pulsatility index (PI) and corrected peak flow rate (cQmax) was — 0. 79. Correlation between the PI of vessels outside the prostate and cQmax was not significant, as the intracapsular PI was. We generated a linear regression equation, cQmax = 0. 8911 × PI + 14. 569, to predict cQmax by intracapsular PI. This equation can be applied when adequate spontaneous voiding is not available.

40|$|Objectives : The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} measurement of urine flow parameters by a non invasive urodynamic test. Variation of flow rates based on <b>voided</b> <b>volume,</b> age, and gender are described. Different nomograms are available for different populations and racial differences of urethral physiology are described. Currently, there has been no study from the Indian population on uroflow parameters. So {{the purpose of this study}} was to establish normal reference ranges of maximum and average flow rates, to see the influence of age, gender, and <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> on flow rates, and to chart these values in the form of a nomogram. Methods : We evaluated 1, 011 uroflowmetry tests in different age groups in a healthy population (healthy relatives of our patients) 16 - 50 year old males,> 50 year old males, 5 - 15 year old children, and> 15 year pre-menopausal and post-menopausal females. The uroflowmetry was done using the gravitimetric method. Flow chart parameters were analyzed and statistical calculations were used for drawing uroflow nomograms. Results : Qmax values in adult males were significantly higher than in the elderly and Qmax values in young females were significantly higher than in young males. Qmax values in males increased with age until 15 years old; followed by a slow decline until reaching 50 years old followed by a rapid decline after 50 years old even after correcting <b>voided</b> <b>volume.</b> Qmax values in females increased with age until they reached age 15 followed by decline in flow rate until a pre-menopausal age followed by no significant decline in post-menopausal females. Qmax values increased with <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> until 700 cc followed by a plateau and decline. Conclusions : Qmax values more significantly correlated with age and <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> than Qavg. Nomograms were drawn in centile form to provide normal reference ranges.

40|$|Introduction/Background : Many recent {{treatment}} guidelines {{have advocated}} {{the importance of}} a full noninvasive medical evaluation. To individualize treatment, special emphasis must be put on recording of the maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> (MVV) and nocturnal diuresis in a diary or frequency/volume chart. Objective : The aim {{of this study was to}} identify any possible predictive factors to desmopressin response. Study design : This study is a re-analysis of a prospective, open-label, multinational, phase-IV study evaluating 4 weeks, diurnal symptoms, renal or central diabetes insipidus and the use of systemic antibiotics or other drugs known to affect desmopressin activity. The predictive value of number of wet nights a week, fluid intake, daytime voiding frequency and diuresis was investigated by performing a multinomial logistic regression. Results : Of the demographic variables, age was the only significant predictor for response to desmopressin. Controlling for age, the significant predictive variables were: number of wet nights a week, average <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> daytime, maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> daytime, total daytime diuresis, nocturnal diuresis (see Figure), maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> 24 h and total 24 h diuresis. More than 80 % of the children had no nocturnal polyuria and a low maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume.</b> Discussion : Performing a secondary analysis is a limitation because the original study was not designed for that. A new prospective study is ethically hardly defendable for children if data are available from previous literature [1]; therefore, a re-analysis was the appropriate choice. The study confirms the predictive value of age, number of wet nights a week and nocturnal diuresis [1, 2]. Conclusions : The study demonstrates that desmopressin response rates are higher in children with greater age, limited number of wet nights a week and nocturnal polyuria. Only a minority of a primary nocturnal enuresis population, based on history alone, had nocturnal polyuria. The majority had a low maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume.</b> The results clearly stress {{the importance of a}} frequency/volume chart for individualizing therapy to the characteristics, thereby resulting in elevated success rates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background As the voiding {{habits of}} Iranian {{children}} differs from other children {{because of some}} cultural and religious considerations, we aimed to establish normal reference values of urinary flow rates in Iranian children between 7 to 14 years of age. Methods Eight hundred and two uroflowmetry studies were performed on children with no history of a renal, urological, psychological or neurological disorder, between the ages 7 and 14. Five hundred twenty five studies from 192 girls and 335 boys were considered in this study excluding the staccato/interrupted voiding pattern or <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> less than 20 ml. The <b>voiding</b> <b>volume,</b> the maximum and average urinary flow rates were extensively analyzed. Results The maximal and average urine flow rate nomograms were plotted for both girls and boys. Mean maximum urine flow rate was 19. 9 (ml/sec) for boys and 23. 5 (ml/sec) for girls with a mean <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> of 142 (ml) for boys and 147 (ml) for girls. Flow rates showed a close association with <b>voiding</b> <b>volume</b> in both sexes. The maximum and average flow rates were higher in girls than in boys, and they showed {{a significant increase in}} flow rates with increasing age, where boys did not. The mean maximum urine flow rates (19. 9 ml/sec for boys and 23. 5 ml/sec for girls) were found to be higher in this study than other studies. Conclusion Nomograms of maximal and average flow rates of girls and boys are presented in centile form, which can help the physician to evaluate the response to medical or surgical treatment and be useful for the screening of lower urinary tract disturbances in children, {{for a wide range of}} <b>voided</b> <b>volumes.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study aims {{to assess}} whether first morning <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> (FMV) {{can be used as}} a tool to {{evaluate}} the symptom severity of patients with an overactive bladder (OAB). Materials and methods: We prospectively recruited patients with OAB symptoms from January 2009 to April 2010. All the patients completed a 3 -day frequency–volume chart, including the measure of FMV and the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) questionnaire. All patients underwent either conventional pressure-flow urodynamic study or videourodynamic study. We analyzed the correlation between FMV, urodynamic studies, and symptom severity. Results: A total of 102 patients, including 43 men and 59 women, were recruited in the study. FMV was significantly correlated to the daily mean <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> (p <  0. 001) and cystometric capacity (p =  0. 026). It was also negatively correlated to the subscores for daytime frequency (p =  0. 013) and nighttime frequency (p <  0. 001) on OABSS. However, no significant correlation was observed between FMV and the total score of OABSS. FMV showed a fair agreement with the maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume,</b> which can predict small-volume bladders (kappa =  0. 42  ±  0. 08, p <  0. 001), whereas the agreement between cystometric capacity and maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> was poor (kappa =  0. 096  ±  0. 05, p =  0. 08). Conclusion: In patients with OAB, FMV can represent the severity of day- and nighttime frequencies. FMV was also shown to have a better ability in predicting small-volume bladders compared to the cystometric capacity. The measure of FMV may be helpful for patients who have poor compliance with regard to recording the frequency–volume chart...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Functional bladder {{capacity}} (FBC) {{and urine}} output are important {{variables in the}} management of incontinence and nocturnal enuresis. The lack of reference ranges for FBC vs. age, and the arbitrarily defined time-windows for measuring urine output, impede the clinical use of these variables in children. To solve these impediments, we had 26 girls and 28 boys, between 6 and 12 years of age, collect, measure, time, and sample every voiding, using 72 -h frequency-volume charts; all samples were analysed for osmolality and creatinine concentration. <b>Voided</b> <b>volumes</b> show a very wide range (10550 ml) and a subset that is significantly larger than all other voidings: early morning voidings (EMV). The individual maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> (MVV) belongs to the category of EMV in 74 % of the children. MVV, the measure for FBC, fits the 595 % centiles that have been published for cystographic bladder capacity for age in normal children; all other voiding are mostly below the 5 % centile. <b>Voided</b> <b>volume</b> plotted vs. corresponding urine output rate shows that, with output rates below 50 ml/h, rest-phase bladder filling always results in significantly larger voidings (EMV) than activity-phase bladder filling. Two circadian rhythms seem to be involved, one for urine output, and another for inhibition of bladder contractility. With hourly population averages of individual urine and osmole output rates plotted on a time scale, circadian patterns appear; these patterns are masked when urine output is collected in blocks of 6, 8, or 12 h. Both plots are promising tools for studying the pathophysiology of <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> vs. urine output, e. g. in children with nocturnal enuresis...|$|R

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 60 men with lower urinary tract symptoms were included in a prospective, open-label, multicenter study. Uroflowmetry measurements were done using three devices/methods: single clinic-based method, followed by up to 12 measurements using the disposable home-based Q(Single) and up to 12 measurements using a home-based digital device. Subjective data on ease of use of Q(Single) and preference of patients was investigated and objective measures of Q(max) and <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> from the three devices were compared.

40|$|Purpose: The anti-incontinence {{effect of}} {{desmopressin}} resides in its concentrating capacity and antidiuretic properties. We compared nighttime urine production on {{wet and dry}} nights in a highly selected study population of children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis associated with proved nocturnal polyuria who responded only partially to intranasal desmopressin. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 39 home recordings of nocturnal urine production and maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> in children 7 to 19 years old (median 8. 9) with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis with nocturnal polyuria who had a partial response to desmopressin. Nocturnal diuresis <b>volume</b> and maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> were documented at baseline (14 days) and during 3 months of followup. Results: Baseline nocturnal urine output (439 +/- 39 ml) {{was significantly higher than}} the maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> (346 93 ml, p < 0. 01). During desmopressin treatment nocturnal urine output on wet nights (405 +/- 113 ml) differed significantly from that on dry nights (241 +/- 45 ml). During treatment nocturnal urine output on wet nights did not differ from baseline values. Conclusions: Persistence of nocturnal polyuria on wet nights in partial desmopressin responders may be related to an insufficient antidiuretic effect. In addition to poor compliance and suboptimal dosing, the poor bioavailability of intranasal desmopressin may be a pathogenic factor. Further prospective studies are needed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Many {{conditions}} and characteristics are cross-sectionally associated with nocturia. However, {{to our knowledge}} longitudinal associations of frequency-volume chart based nocturia {{have not yet been}} studied. We identify (modifiable) determinants of nocturia in older men in a longitudinal setting. Materials and Methods: A longitudinal, community based study was conducted among 1, 688 men age 50 to 78 years in Krimpen aan den IJssel, The Netherlands with planned followup rounds at 2, 4 and 6 years. Men without a history of radical prostatectomy, transurethral surgery, or bladder or prostate cancer were included in the study. Data were obtained using frequency-volume charts, from which the nocturnal voiding frequency, maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> and (nocturnal) urine production were determined. Nocturia was defined as a nocturnal voiding frequency of 2 or more episodes. Polyuria was defined as greater than 2, 800 ml voided per 24 hours. For nocturnal polyuria we used the 2 definitions of 1) greater than 33 % of 24 -hour <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> and 2) nocturnal urine production of greater than 90 ml per hour. Conditions and characteristics were determined via medical examinations and questionnaires. A generalized linear mixed effect model was used to determine factors longitudinally associated with nocturia. Results: Age (50 to 55 years vs greater than 60 years), maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume</b> (greater than 300 ml vs less than 300 ml), 24 -hour polyuria, nocturnal polyuria (both definitions) and lower urinary tract symptoms were all longitudinally associated with an increased prevalence of nocturia in older men. Conclusions: A smaller maximum <b>voided</b> <b>volume,</b> lower urinary tract symptoms, 24 -hour polyuria and nocturnal polyuria are significant and potentially modifiable determinants of nocturia. The finding that both definitions for nocturnal polyuria are independent significant determinants may indicate a 2 -step etiologic process for nocturnal polyuria...|$|R
