50|$|On November 1, 2005, Kaus and {{journalist}} Robert Wright launched BloggingHeads.tv, a <b>video</b> <b>weblog</b> dialog or dia-vlog focusing on mostly-political current events. Initially Kaus and Wright were the regular participants. Eventually Wright recruited many other bloggers, journalists and scholars to take part, discussing the headlines and latest developments and making predictions. Wright, who bought out Kaus {{in the early}} days of the site, still appears often with various guests. By contrast, Kaus's appearances have become increasingly infrequent. When he does appear he is almost always paired with Wright.|$|E

In 1994, {{he came to the}} Netherlands to help establish comedy theater Boom Chicago, where he worked with Seth Meyers, Jordan Peele, Ike Barinholtz, Kay Cannon, Heather Anne Campbell, and Allison Silverman, among others. In 2004, he voiced the FloridaVotingMachine video that went viral before there was YouTube. In 2007, Shapiro hosted Comedy Central News on Comedy Central and started his own <b>video</b> <b>weblog</b> Highly Dubious News. His radio column The New and Improved America appeared on BNR Newsradio in 2008. His vlog War for the White House appeared on Volkskrant.nl in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Gravel's address {{before the}} DNC National Winter Conference in early February 2007 was {{received}} - enthusiastically, claimed campaign advocates - and was broadcast on C-SPAN. In speaking he offered harsh judgments against President Bush and the Senate Democratic leadership, and implicitly his presidential rivals Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and John Edwards, saying [...] "anyone {{who voted for}} the war on October 11 based upon what President Bush presented to them is not qualified to hold the office of President of the United States." [...] Gravel was interviewed on MSNBC at the time. He also appeared as a guest of a <b>video</b> <b>weblog</b> directed from New Jersey answering questions about netroots and the blogosphere.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{clips from}} home movies have been {{available}} to wider audiences through television series such as America's Funniest Home Videos, in Great Britain You've Been Framed! and Internet online video-sharing sites such as YouTube. The popularity of the Internet, and wider availability of high-speed connections has provided new ways of sharing home movies, such as <b>video</b> <b>weblogs</b> (vlogs), and <b>video</b> podcasts.|$|R
50|$|GameSetWatch is an {{alternative}} <b>video</b> game <b>weblog</b> and sister site of Gamasutra.com. It is dedicated to collecting curious links and media for offbeat and often ignored games from consoles old and new, {{as well as from}} the digital download, iOS, and indie spaces.|$|R
5000|$|As {{of early}} 2004, Weblogs, Inc. {{was seeking to}} add a blog to its {{repertoire}} {{for the sole purpose}} of covering news related to video games, as evidenced by the now-defunct The <b>Video</b> Games <b>Weblog,</b> founded February 27, 2004. On March 12, Weblogs, Inc. CEO Jason Calacanis announced two spinoff projects: The Unofficial Playstation 3 Weblog and The Unofficial Xbox 2, both of which are now similarly retired, though they would set a precedent for the launching of Joystiq's Fanboy blogs in 2005. However, none of these three initial weblogs were ever aggressively marketed, and The <b>Video</b> Games <b>Weblog</b> made its final post on May 18, 2005, amassing 175 blog entries in total (a rather scant amount by Weblogs, Inc. standards). All three blogs are now listed as [...] "On Hiatus/Retired" [...] in the Weblogs, Inc. directory. David Touve, the primary contributor to these early blogs, would later act as Joystiq's features editor for a short time in late 2005 before resigning due to the birth of his child.|$|R
5000|$|Bedingfield {{performed}} {{this song}} at the Concert for Diana. Natasha performed this, along with [...] "Pocketful of Sunshine" [...] {{in the season}} 7 finale of Degrassi: The Next Generation. It is the theme song to the globally popular MTV series, The Hills. Bedingfield later re-recorded another, slower version of [...] "Unwritten" [...] with production team Carney {{for use in the}} final episode of The Hills. [...] "Unwritten" [...] has been featured in the following motion pictures: Ice Princess, Because I Said So, and The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. 2006 World Champion figure skater Kimmie Meissner has done multiple exhibition programs to the song as well. The song appears in the video games Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol and Thrillville: Off the Rails. While the Johnny Vicious remix appears in Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova 2 along with its original video. The song was used for the 2006-2007 Pantene shampoo television and radio advertisements in English-speaking and other markets. The song is the theme for Ayla Besemer's <b>video</b> <b>weblog,</b> From the PilotHouse (about life on the ship Three@Sea). The song appears in the [...] "Running Around" [...] episode of Cold Case. This song was popularized and used in Pantene shampoo commercials in France, Spain, Poland, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. It is featured in the Pretty Little Liars season 5 finale [...] "Welcome to the Dollhouse". It is also very popular at special events such as Graduations, Sweet 16s, and Weddings.|$|E
5000|$|Readers of <b>video</b> game <b>weblog</b> Joystiq voted Buckley's pair of comics that {{he wrote}} for the video game Civilization IV: Beyond the Swords website as the most popular. Ross Miller of Joystiq {{described}} the two strips as ones that [...] "played on historical anachronisms and World Wonder rule sets", while noting that he hoped that those who voted in the poll [...] "didn't choose the strip for the Buttsylvania line". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Levi Buchanan compared Ctrl+Alt+Del to Penny Arcade, describing both as webcomics that {{take advantage of the}} lack of censorship on the web by using expletives when they are appropriate, and if they serve the story. Buchanan also considered Ctrl+Alt+Del to be a webcomic with a smaller cast than that of Penny Arcade, noting that the former focuses primarily on the two friends Ethan and Lucas, while the latter comprises a much larger cast.|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of the study are (a) to put the “cyclic model of learning” into practice {{by means of an}} LMS (Learning Management System) for foreign language teaching /learning, and (b) to examine how the “cyclic model of learning” influences improvement of students' English ability in both proficiency and achievement. Current major concerns of CALL (Computer Assisted Language learning) research have shifted from piecemeal and experimental tests of the use of technology in a single computer lab to seamless and integrated practices in a natural educational setting. In response to this transition, Takeuchi developed the “cyclic model of learning”. The model tries to integrate in-class practice and students' outside-class self-learning with the aid of technology. In this article, the “cyclic model of learning” was put into practice and tested on 19 1 st-year undergraduate students for one year at a university in the Kansai region. An LMS, named CEAS (Coordinated Education Activation System), is employed to support the practice. Data were collected {{in a variety of ways}} including test, <b>weblog,</b> <b>video</b> recording, questionnaires, and classroom observation. Findings indicated that the practice based on the “cyclic model of learning” contributed to the improvement of students’ English ability in both proficiency and achievement...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this paper are to (a) elaborate on the Cyclic Model of Learning (CML; Takeuchi, 2007), which was formed based on the four phases of the design-based research (DBR) framework (Amiel & Reeves, 2008); (b) to put the model into practice through use of technology {{in the field of}} EFL teaching; and (c) to examine how the CML-based teaching practice influences students’ English ability and the instructor’s teaching methods. Based on the four phases of the DBR framework, a qualitative investigation was conducted to identify the problems that impede teachers’ use of technology in EFL teaching (Sumi, 2011). To ameliorate the problems, following {{the second phase of the}} DBR framework, the CML was created and applied to a research project. The most distinctive feature of the CML is its integration of in-class practices with students’ out-of-class self-learning with aid of CALL technology. The CML was put into practice and tested on 19 first-year undergraduate students of EFL over the course of one year at a university in Japan. Data were collected, both on- and off-line, in a variety of ways including quizzes, <b>weblog,</b> <b>video</b> recording, questionnaires, and classroom observation. Findings confirmed that CML-based teaching practice contributed to the improvement of both students’ English abilities and the instructor’s teaching methods...|$|R
40|$|Design {{does not}} only {{try to make}} life more {{beautiful}} but also particularly better. Basically all forms of design want to add something to or change something in the environment. Still {{we can make a}} difference between the more or the less innovative notions of what they want to add exactly. The more classical approaches emphasize merely functional and/or aesthetic design. Design then has to be as user-friendly, as pleasant or as nice as possible. The more innovative approaches of design, however, take it a step further. They integrate the environment, the political, social, economic or ecological context into their process of changing the environment. Social and “transformational design” are two terms that sketch this rather “holistic” approach of design, which means that they take the specific context of the design into account. The term “experience design” takes it another step further in our interpretation. With this term we not only underline the process of changing the environment, but also the change of man’s experience of the environment. In this way psychological or biological systems become involved in the design process as well. Social problems and phenomena are complex, chaotic and often intangible. Therefore they call for a multidisciplinary approach. The design for the health sector, the ecological environment or the third world does not always {{take the form of a}} delineated product either. A designer traditionally chops a problem into pieces with an eye on small solutions that are tangible in the short term (Design Council, 2007). Moreover, designing for social problems is not always experienced as being very attractive. Also sectors for which designs are made, like the health sector in this case, do not seldom expect fast and tangible solutions. With short-term solutions we can quickly show off and score, but they do not necessarily lead to an integrated approach to complex problems. In this case study we try to counter this short-term thinking by going through a research process together with a multidisciplinary team of older people, health care workers, designers, students and lecturers. Together we wish to learn what design can mean for the care of the elderly and vice versa. The students and lecturers of the Catholic School of Limburg (Media and Design Academy and Department of Public Health Care) therefore decided to address an always growing group that at the same time has been neglected by design in our society. In the project “Carefree Living in the care for the elderly” they asked the question how they could make the life of older people in the services for the elderly more “carefree” and maybe even more pleasant by using media. This case also surpasses the services for the elderly. We wish to underline the importance of social and experience design. Besides the already mentioned complexity of social problems, the term experience design emphasizes the complexity of the world of experience of the individual. Experimenting with new research approaches can make design more socially relevant and, conversely, make social, economic and artistic sectors more adapted to the world of experience for its target audience. The ever changing technology is the tool of designers who wish to change the world. “We know what technology can do, but what is it for?”, John Tackara - director of the “design futures network. Doors of Perception” – asks. With technology we can build magical constructions which make barely visible things of society visible (Zielinski, 2006). In the “Alzheimer 100 ” project Thakara for example made the experiences of people suffering from Alzheimer visible through <b>weblogs,</b> <b>videos</b> or pictures. He and his team will translate this material into new products and services in the long run (Thakara, 2007). Technology, however, makes many people feel anxious and thus needs to be developed in close coherence with the current society in order to implement some real changes. status: publishe...|$|R
