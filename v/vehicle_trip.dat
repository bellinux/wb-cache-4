30|$|The {{passenger}} transportation demand literature makes {{a distinction}} between two key metrics: the number of passenger trips produced and attracted, {{and the number of}} vehicle trips required to transport the passenger trips [6]. In contrast, the traffic engineering literature mostly focus on <b>vehicle</b> <b>trip</b> generation which is what matters the most in traffic impact analyses. Probably, the largest compilation of this kind of models is the Trip Generation Manual [7] which contains hundreds of models as functions of land use. In the case of FSA, the relevant metrics are: freight generation (FG)—the amount of cargo a commercial establishment generates measured by a unit of weight, typically pounds/day or tons/day; freight trip generation (FTG)—the number of freight vehicle trips generated by an establishment; and service trip generation (STG) the number of service vehicle trips generated by an establishment. Each of these can be further decomposed into attraction and production. Attraction is all incoming flow whether cargo or vehicle trips to the establishment plus the <b>vehicle</b> <b>trip</b> that leaves the establishment after performing a delivery or service. Production is the outgoing flow of cargo or vehicle trips leaving the establishment, plus the <b>vehicle</b> <b>trip</b> returning to the establishment after conducting a delivery or service at another location [6]. Reflecting the lack of research on FSA, the existing compilations of FTG models are much smaller than the massive ITE Trip Generation Manual [8, 9].|$|E

This approach was developed to adjust the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Handbook <b>vehicle</b> <b>trip</b> rates based on built environment characteristics where the establishments were located. A number of policy-relevant built environment measures were used to estimate a set of nine models predicting an adjustment to ITE trip rates. Each model was estimated as a single measure: activity density, number of transit corridors, number of high-frequency bus lines, employment density, lot coverage, length of bicycle facilities, presence of rail transit, retail and service employment index, and intersection density. All of these models perform similarly (Adj. R 2 0. 76 - 0. 77) in estimating trip rate adjustments. Data from 34 additional sites were collected to verify the adjustments. For convenience markets and drinking places, the adjustment models were an improvement to the ITE’s handbook method, while adjustments for restaurants tended to perform similarly to those from ITE’s estimation. The approach here is useful in guiding plans and policies for a short-term improvement to the ITE’s Trip Generation Handbook. The measures are useful for communities seeking to develop local adjustments to <b>vehicle</b> <b>trip</b> rate estimates, and all could be calculated from spatial data available in most locations.

Service trips are called as such because their main purpose is to perform a service activity; for example, machine repairs/installations, and maintenance/cleaning of premises. Some service trips may contain a component of freight as they may pick-up or drop-off equipment or machine parts for example, but due to the definition previously stated are still classified as service trips. Two key aspects of service trips that differ from freight trips are: (1) the time spent at the receiving establishment—service trips typically take a longer time to complete, this has implications on parking; and (2) <b>vehicle</b> type used—service <b>trips</b> tend to use smaller vehicles {{which may not be}} easily identified, and as such may be mistaken for passenger vehicles [30].

In contrast, in weekend behavior, there were five potential independent variables which were X 2, unit price (X 4), X 9, the distance between each sample and main road (X 10), and X 12. Better estimating trip generation is recommended for a reduction of the traffic impact surrounding the residential building.
