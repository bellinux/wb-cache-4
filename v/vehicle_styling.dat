40|$|The methodical {{bases of}} {{numerical}} strength analysis of body frame arrangement in vehicle design {{have been developed}} which {{make it possible for}} a designer to reach a scientifically proven decision on geometrics of <b>vehicle</b> <b>styling</b> subsequent to the results of body frame arrangement evaluative research. Hardware and software which are used in design and preproduction of industrial goods and vehicles are continuously being upgraded. Features of software tools with regard to electronic geometrical modeling and numerical reverse engineering are widening. Advanced software systems for engineer-ing research have simplified the problem of initial data preparation and carrying out some numerical studies to the extent possible. There is a real possibility to apply numerical engineering evaluations in preconceptual design works at the early designing stages. That may be demonstrated by the example of frame arrangement design of light vehicles, such as tricycles and all-terrain vehicles. Frame ar-rangement functions as load-carrying elements, and it bears great aesthetics load in terms of develop-ment of original and attractive exterior of the vehicle...|$|E
40|$|The fast, {{early and}} easy synthesis, {{manipulation}} {{and evaluation of}} shape are of increasing importance {{for the success of}} new products. 3 D scanning of existing artifacts is one input source for the developer of new product concepts. All or part of the scanned data can serve to build up or to modify a shape concept. Available techniques in industry known as Reverse Engineering are only of limited support to the concept designer. In this paper the requirements against 3 D shape scanning are identified. Then a methodology is proposed for shape design and manipulation based on the reuse of existing physical objects. The major issues to be solved for this methodology to be effective are: a) Finding the optimal strategy for 3 D digitizing of shape, b) identifying those modeling entities, their nature and their parameterization, that are suited for conceptual shape design, c) representing the measured data in accordance with those entities. We propose solutions to each of these problems. We demonstrate the value of the method for a typical shape conceptualization task in motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>styling...</b>|$|E

50|$|At some point, the {{performance}} advantage of larger wheels and reduced-profile tires meets {{the performance}} disadvantage of increased inertia and increased unsprung weight. This point {{varies depending on}} the <b>vehicle,</b> <b>style</b> of wheel, and driving style; however, most vehicles do not see a performance increase when rims are more than two sizes larger than original-equipment specifications. Appearance-oriented enthusiasts may feel that decreased performance and {{an increased risk of}} road damage from the use of oversized rims is a worthwhile price to pay for the look they want.|$|R
2500|$|Generally, {{drivers of}} SUVs are safer {{than those in}} small and {{mid-size}} cars.

[...] This survey reflects the effect of both vehicle design and driving behaviour. Drivers of SUVs, minivans, and large cars may drive differently than the drivers of small or mid-size cars, therefore the effect of drivers in the survey may affect the result.|$|R
40|$|Drawing is an {{essential}} component in the industrial design process, facilitating visual thinking and creativity. It constitutes one type of design model, along with specifications, 3 D representations and CAD techniques. The design process involves movement from one model to another, and by using representations of different types and {{at different levels of}} detail a fluid and inventive design approach is facilitated. Examples of schematic drawings, ideas sketches and concept drawings demonstrate this in product design and transport design. CAD has proved to be highly effective in evaluative and analytical design development, and in manufacture. It is inherently unsuitable for innovative design, but has potential for contributing to evolutionary design, as is evidenced by its proven effectiveness in engineering optimization. Automotive design is almost always concerned with design evolution, and procedures for car stylists to work productively with CAD are being developed in Coventry Polytechnic's SERC funded research project Computer Aided <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Styling.</b> Vehicle stylist's design thinking is characterized by holistic, right-hemisphere processes informed by tacit knowledge and dependent on visual representation. They have particular difficulties with CAD systems. Nonetheless, design techniques that capitalize on CAD's potential and may be applicable to industrial design are briefly described. CAD drawings and conventional design drawings are compared by using examples from the car industry, and from the research project. Tentative speculations about future design procedures are made. ...|$|E
