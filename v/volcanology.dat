5|$|Seismic {{activity}} in Indonesia is {{monitored by the}} Directorate of <b>Volcanology</b> and Geological Hazard Mitigation, Indonesia. The monitoring post for Mount Tambora is located at Doro Peti village. They use a seismograph to measure seismic and tectonic activity. Since the 1880 eruption, no significant increase in seismic activity has occurred. Monitoring is performed continuously inside the caldera, especially around the Doro Api Toi parasitic cone.|$|E
5|$|The {{most active}} volcanoes are Kelud and Merapi on Java island {{which have been}} {{responsible}} for thousands of deaths in the region. Since AD 1000, Kelut has erupted more than 30 times, of which the largest eruption was at scale 5 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI), while Mount Merapi has erupted more than 80 times. The International Association of <b>Volcanology</b> and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior has named Mount Merapi as a Decade Volcano since 1995 because of its high volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|While at Penn State, Voight had a joint {{affiliation}} with the school's Department of Mineral Engineering and taught courses in physical geology, mechanics of geological materials, and <b>volcanology.</b> During his career, he also lectured as a guest professor at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands in 1972, working under Jacques Dozy, {{and served as a}} visiting professor at the University of Toronto in 1973 and at the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1981. Still an emeritus professor at Penn State, he initiated an endowment under his name to contribute to the education of volcanic hazard specialists from developing countries.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Heart of Darkness in 1998, Chahi left the video games industry to explore other interests, and subsequently developed a passion for <b>volcanology.</b> In the past, Chahi self-produced video games, as the PC market was independent games-orientated. However, the independent game's importance diminished by 2006, so Chahi decided {{to work with a}} publisher instead. He presented the concept to Ubisoft in 2006. According to Chahi, it was not difficult to convince Ubisoft to fund the project, though initially there was hesitation and the proposal was rejected. After the company reversed its decision, the team spent approximately two years meeting with the key people within Ubisoft; development properly began in January 2008. The team initially only had three people, but it was expanded to about 15 to 20 people, which was considered a small team for Ubisoft.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of an Anahim hotspot was supported in a detailed Bulletin of <b>Volcanology</b> report by Kuehn et al. (2015). This included new geochemical and geochronometric data for the Baldface Mountain and Satah Mountain volcanic fields, {{as well as for}} Nazko Cone. The data obtained indicated that volcanism in the two volcanic fields were contemporaneous with the Itcha Range shield volcano and that both fields agree with the vector of the North American Plate motion over a hotspot in the British Columbia Interior. It was also noted that the trace and rare-earth element patterns of mafic lavas in the Anahim Volcanic Belt are similar to ocean island basalts, providing more evidence for a hotspot.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary source}} of the list below is taken from the Volcanoes of the World book, {{compiled}} by two volcanologists Tom Simkin and Lee Siebert, in which active volcanoes in the past 10,000years (Holocene) are listed. Particularly for Indonesia, Simkin and Siebert used a catalogue of active volcanoes from the International Association of <b>Volcanology</b> and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior publication series. The Simkin and Siebert list is the most complete list of volcanoes in Indonesia, but {{the accuracy of the}} record varies from one region to another in terms of contemporary activities and fatalities in recent eruptions. Complementary sources for the latest volcanic data are taken from the Volcanological Survey of Indonesia, a governmental institution which is responsible for volcanic activities and geological hazard mitigation in Indonesia, and some academic resources.|$|E
5|$|<b>Volcanology</b> of Io, a moon of Jupiter, is the {{scientific}} study of lava flows, volcanic pits, and volcanism (volcanic activity) on the surface of Io. Its volcanic activity was discovered in 1979 by Voyager 1 imaging scientist Linda Morabito. Observations of Io by passing spacecraft (the Voyagers, Galileo, Cassini, and New Horizons) and Earth-based astronomers have revealed more than 150 active volcanoes. Up to 400 such volcanoes are predicted to exist based on these observations. Io's volcanism makes the satellite one of only four known currently volcanically active worlds in the Solar System (the other three being Earth, Saturn's moon Enceladus, and Neptune's moon Triton).|$|E
5|$|Mauna Loa {{has been}} {{designated}} a Decade Volcano, one of the sixteen volcanoes identified by the International Association of <b>Volcanology</b> and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (IAVCEI) as being worthy of particular study {{in light of their}} history of large, destructive eruptions and proximity to populated areas. The United States Geological Survey maintains a hazard zone mapping of the island done on a one to nine scale, with the most dangerous areas corresponding the smallest numbers. Based on this classification Mauna Loa's continuously active summit caldera and rift zones have been given a level one designation. Much of the area immediately surrounding the rift zones is considered level two, and about 20 percent of the area has been covered in lava in historical times. Much of the remainder of the volcano is hazard level three, about 15 to 20 percent of which has been covered by flows within the last 750 years. However, two sections of the volcano, the first in the Naalehu area and the second on the southeastern flank of Mauna Loa's rift zone, are protected from eruptive activity by local topography, and have thus been designated hazard level 6, comparable with a similarly isolated segment on Kīlauea.|$|E

25|$|On Monday 8 November Dr. Surono, Head of the <b>Volcanology</b> and Geological Hazard Mitigation (PVMBG) {{reminded}} {{volunteers and}} rescue workers that eruptive activity was still high. Volunteers were reminded {{to be aware}} of the mortal danger presented by the pyroclastic clouds and were encouraged to concentrate on assisting the living at the refugee shelters rather than being concerned about the evacuation of the dead from the mountain. It was made clear by Dr. Surono that only Army Special Forces, specialised Search and Rescue teams, and the Police should be involved in those highly dangerous activities. Nine further victims died from the further eruptions of Mount Merapi at Dr Sardjito hospital in Yogyakata on Monday 9 November bringing the total number of deaths recorded there to 97, with 103 victims still being treated at that hospital.|$|E
25|$|Volcanic {{activity}} of the main-arc began {{at the southern end}} of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt about 29million years ago during the middle Oligocene epoch. It then shifted northwards to the Coquihalla region 22million years ago, followed by volcanism near the town of Pemberton 16to 17million years ago. In the Salal Creek area, volcanic activity occurred 8.0million years ago and the northernmost Pemberton Belt volcano formed 6.8million years ago. The northward younging of Pemberton Belt volcanism indicates that a slab window edge was moving northward under British Columbia between at least the onset of arc volcanism 29million years ago and eruption of the northernmost volcano 6.8million years ago. The extensive Masset Formation on Haida Gwaii has been suggested by some scientists to be a northern extension of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt. However, the geochemistry and physical <b>volcanology</b> of the Masset Formation indicates that it formed in a rifting environment in contrast to other Pemberton Belt features.|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{services}} were overwhelmed {{in the aftermath}} of the quake. At least 30 people, including some children, were admitted to the nearest hospital for bone fractures. Search and rescue teams were immediately assembled and deployed to the scene, including the Disaster Victims Identification team (DVI). Coordination centres were set up in the hardest-hit areas. The Indonesian <b>Volcanology</b> and Geologic Disaster Mitigation departments, and the Ministry of Energy and Human Resources were also sent to the disaster area. One person was reportedly killed due to falling debris. Further search and rescue operations discovered more deaths in Pidie Jaya. The Vice Regent of Pidie Jaya Regency, Said Mulyadi, stated that at least 18 people were killed in the quake, with dozens trapped under rubble. The number reportedly injured was increased to 500, while treatment of the injured was initially limited to the streets as treating patients indoors was prohibited for fear of aftershocks. As local hospitals were overwhelmed, more survivors were transported to other main hospitals, including Pidie Jaya Hospital (outdoor, as the indoor section were heavily damaged) and Chik Di Tiro Hospital. Severely injured people were transported by helicopters to Banda Aceh, the provincial capital.|$|E
500|$|After the eruption, Voight {{accepted}} {{a position as}} a consultant for the USGS. He led {{the investigation into the}} volcano debris avalanche which had occurred during the eruption, guiding other volcanologists including Harry Glicken, who built upon Voight's preliminary research to create his report [...] "Rockslide-Debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington" [...] (1996). Voight's work won him international renown, and he later cited his experiences there as [...] "career-changing". Although Voight already had a burgeoning interest in <b>volcanology,</b> the eruption at Mount St. Helens propelled him to dedicate himself to the field. His work helped reinvigorate widespread interest in landslides and other phenomena at volcanoes that potentially pose a threat to life. After completing his research at Mount St. Helens, Voight began analyzing the volcanic hazards from several other active volcanoes.|$|E
500|$|Glicken's {{father said}} in 1991 {{that his son}} died {{pursuing}} his passion, {{and that he was}} [...] "totally absorbed" [...] with <b>volcanology.</b> United States Geological Survey co-worker Don Peterson adds that Glicken was keen in his enthusiastic approach to observation, and praises his accomplishments throughout his career and as a graduate student. Speaking about Glicken's personal passion for his field, his mentor and professor Richard V. Fisher writes, [...] "What happened at St. Helens is something that troubled [...] deeply for a very long time, and, in a way, I think it made him even more dedicated than he was before." [...] Associate Robin Holcomb remarks that [...] "Harry was very enthusiastic, very bright, and very ambitious, ambitious to do something worthwhile on volcanoes." [...] Many studies have utilized Glicken's criteria for volcanic landslide recognition, and many subsequent papers on avalanches have acknowledged or referenced Glicken's 1996 report. Reflecting on Glicken's body of work, USGS employee Don Swanson names him as [...] "a world leader in studies of volcanic debris avalanches".|$|E
500|$|Radiometric dating {{was used}} to {{determine}} the age of rock samples from Lōʻihi. The Hawaii Center for <b>Volcanology</b> tested samples recovered by various expeditions, notably the 1978 expedition, which provided 17 dredge samples. Most of the samples were found to be of recent origin; the oldest dated rock is around 300,000 years old. Following the 1996 event, some young breccia was also collected. Based on the samples, scientists estimate Lōʻihi is about 400,000 years old. The rock accumulates at an average rate of [...] per year near the base, and [...] near the summit. If the data model from other volcanoes such as Kīlauea holds true for Lōʻihi, 40% of the volcano's mass formed within the last 100,000 years. Assuming a linear growth rate, Lōʻihi is 250,000 years old. However, as with all hotspot volcanoes, Lōʻihi's level of activity has increased with time; therefore, it would take at least 400,000 years for such a volcano to reach Lōʻihi's mass. As Hawaiian volcanoes drift northwest {{at a rate of about}} [...] a year, Lōʻihi was [...] southeast of its current position at the time of its initial eruption.|$|E
500|$|For {{his service}} as a {{professor}} at Penn State, Voight has been given two awards, specifically for his research. In 1990, he received the Wilson Research Award from the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences for excellence in research.

In 2008, Voight was appointed a Union Fellow of the American Geophysical Union for “fundamental contributions {{to the understanding of}} volcano deformation, assessment of volcano hazards, and forecasting", and the following year, he was awarded the Schuster Medal by the Canadian Geotechnical Society for [...] "outstanding achievements in research on geologic hazards in North America". For [...] "his research, teaching and consulting work", the Engineering Geology Division of the Geological Society of America presented him with their 2010 Distinguished Practice Award. Voight received the Thorarinsson Medal of the International Association of <b>Volcanology</b> and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior in 2013, granted to a [...] "scientist of outstanding distinction who has made fundamental contributions to research in volcanology", and in 2017 he was elected as a Member of the National Academy of Engineering for [...] "contributions to the understanding, management, and mitigation of geologic hazards." ...|$|E
