2500|$|The {{last known}} form of {{enforced}} servitude of adults (<b>villeinage)</b> had disappeared in England {{by the beginning}} of the 17th century. In a 1569 court case involving Cartwright, who had bought a slave from Russia, the court ruled that English law could not recognize slavery, as it was never established officially. This ruling was overshadowed by later developments. [...] It was upheld in 1700 by the Lord Chief Justice John Holt when he ruled that a slave became free as soon as he arrived in England.|$|E
6000|$|Starting on the {{assumption}} that society is at present in a state of flux, Mr. Ghent sees it rapidly crystallizing into a status which can best be described as something in the nature of a benevolent feudalism. He laughs to scorn any immediate realization of the Marxian dream, while Tolstoyan utopias and Kropotkinian communistic unions of shop and farm are too wild to merit consideration. The coming status which Mr. Ghent depicts is a class domination by the capitalists. Labor will take its definite place as a dependent class, living in a condition of machine servitude fairly analogous to the land servitude of the Middle Ages. That is to say, labor will be bound to the machine, though less harshly, in fashion somewhat similar to that in which the earlier serf was bound to the soil. As he says, [...] "Bondage to the land was the basis of <b>villeinage</b> in the old regime; bondage to the job will be the basis of <b>villeinage</b> in the new." ...|$|E
60|$|Simon the Draper, {{otherwise}} Sir Simon de Wynton, {{granted a}} plot of land to the north-west of the Manor House to Adam de Lecke in <b>villeinage,</b> and later in freehold to John de Otterbourne, reserving thirteen shillings rent. By this last it was rented on his wife Alice, from whom it passed through several hands to John Colpoys {{in the year of}} Henry VI., and twenty-two years later this same John Colpoys agreed with the warden and fellows of Winchester College to enfeoff them of one messuage, four tofts, twenty acres of arable land, and eighteen acres of meadow, to the intent that they should on the 7th day of April in every year celebrate the obits of Alice his deceased wife, of John Giles and Maud his wife (her parents), of Sir John Shirborne and of Joan Parke, and of Colpoys himself and Joan his then wife, after their respective deaths.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} Glebelization comes from {{interdisciplinary}} studies {{according to which}} {{the process of the}} worldwide impoverishment is intended as the direct consequence of the phenomena of the present economic globalization. The process of economy mundialization is almost an unquestionable reality for a long time. This process, which according to some authors began even with the Italian Maritime Republics in the Mediterranean Sea and then consolidated with the discover of the New World, has been considered from different point of view by scholars of different social disciplines. The “Globalization” - as it is intended today this reality - has entailed well-known undoubted advantages, but entailing also non-trivial difficulties and contraindications. First of all the huge and apparently inexorable influence that the worldwide finance - which has been left free and without rules - performs in the economic world, so much {{that it had to be}} defined as “independent variable” of the economic system. That is, according to other scholars, we find us to operate in a “financiarized economy”. With the existence of an uncontrolled and global finance, together with unprecedented means of communication and innovation processes more and more rapid, the frameworks and the paradigms - which up until now have featured the approaches of the economic sciences, the politics, the sociology and the law - have the necessity of a deep reconsideration that could highlight the systemic interconnections amongst the different method of analysis. These analysis of interdisciplinary origin sometimes have obtained results which lead to make the conclusion that the mundialization process won’t represent a mere “globalization” with a positive amount as difference in terms of growing and development. On the contrary, it will entail the concentration of the worldwide richness in the hands of few groups, with a contextual generalized impoverishment of the middle classes, over all the Western’s ones, until today rich and powerful. Here, the consequent neologism “Glebelization” which conveys the return to the <b>villeinage’s</b> generalized poorness in the Middle Age or to the sceneries masterfully described in Charles Dickens’ novels narrating the miserable conditions of the poorer classes of the previous centuries.|$|R

50|$|<b>Villeinage</b> was {{not always}} an {{involuntary}} arrangement. In the early Middle Ages families entered <b>villeinage</b> voluntarily, to guarantee tenure of land. And while villeins were heavily restricted in what they could do, it was also {{possible for them to}} gain manumission. Many villeins were in <b>villeinage</b> because of the land they held, rather than by birth, and could become free men if their lord agreed with them to move them to a different holding.|$|E

50|$|<b>Villeinage</b> was not {{a purely}} exploitative relationship. In the Middle Ages, land {{guaranteed}} sustenance and survival; being a villein guaranteed access to land.

50|$|A {{variety of}} kinds of <b>villeinage</b> {{existed in the}} European Middle Ages, and it is {{impossible}} to arrive at a precise definition which satisfies them all. Different times and countries dealt with <b>villeinage</b> in slightly different ways. Some villeins had clearly defined and limited responsibilities to their lords, while others were essentially at their whim.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} kinds of <b>villeinage</b> existed in Europe in the Middle Ages. Half-villeins {{received}} {{only half as}} many strips of land for their own use and owed {{a full complement of}} labour to the lord, often forcing them to rent out their services to other serfs to make up for this hardship. <b>Villeinage</b> was not, however, a purely uni-directional exploitative relationship. In the Middle Ages, land within a lord's manor provided sustenance and survival, and being a villein guaranteed access to land, and crops secure from theft by marauding robbers. Landlords, even where legally entitled to do so, rarely evicted villeins because of the value of their labour. <b>Villeinage</b> was much preferable to being a vagabond, a slave, or an unlanded labourer.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Villeinage</b> became {{progressively}} {{less common}} through the Middle Ages, particularly after the Black Death reduced the rural population {{and increased the}} bargaining power of workers. Furthermore, the lords of many manors were willing (for payment) to manumit their villeins. It had largely died out in England by 1500 as a personal status, but land held by villein tenure (unless enfranchised) continued to be held by what was henceforth known as a copyhold tenancy, which was not abolished until 1925. <b>Villeinage</b> continued in France until 1789.|$|E
50|$|A chiefage, or chevage, {{according}} to Henry de Bracton, was a tribute by the head; or {{a kind of}} poll-money paid by those who held lands in <b>villeinage,</b> or otherwise, to their lords, in acknowledgement.|$|E
50|$|On 20 December 1782 <b>villeinage</b> was {{abolished}} in Anterior Austria.

50|$|The 1711 Peace of Szatmár {{following}} the Rákóczi Uprising abolished {{the privileges of}} the Cumans and Jazyges but Jazygia-Cumania was restored by Maria Theresa of Austria in 1745.

50|$|Clause 9 {{raises the}} issue whereby urban {{residence}} {{for a year}} and day would secure an individual freedom from <b>villeinage.</b> Migration from the countryside into Chester - prospering as a port in the wake of Henry II’s acquisitions in Ireland - was of concern to the Cheshire barons, who wanted their entitlements to reclaim their villeins spelled out.|$|E
50|$|Bastardy {{was not a}} status, like <b>villeinage,</b> but {{the fact}} of being a bastard had a number of legal effects on an individual.

50|$|Between 1760 and 1785 Emperor Joseph II {{attempted}} to legislate {{a series of}} drastic reforms to remodel Austria {{in the form of}} the ideal Enlightened state.

The reforms centralized the administration and legislation and reduced the rights of the local authorities.|$|E
50|$|Welsh village society (as in Gwytherin) and {{the terms}} of {{customary}} service are described. Foreigners (alltudau, or exiles) such as Engelard, with {{no place in the}} community guaranteed by family ties, may enter a form of indentured servitude. Unlike <b>villeinage</b> as in England, this may be terminated by the servant dividing his chattels with the master who gave him the opportunity of owning them.|$|E
50|$|Although {{legislation}} and enforcement varied {{depending on the}} period and administration, a socager’s rights of entitlement to their <b>villeinage</b> could not be revoked {{as long as they}} paid their duties and fees to the lord of the manor and satisfied the requirements of tenir feu et lieu, which stipulated that they were obliged to improve their landholdings or they would be confiscated. By ordinance of the Intendant in 1682, a socager could not hold more than two villeinages.|$|E
50|$|In the 18th century, the <b>villeinage</b> {{held the}} lands. The next class were the craftswomen and craftsmen. The first charter of {{incorporation}} was mentioned in 1737 in Kalocsa. In 1769 {{a total of}} 90 craftswomen and men lived in the town. Because of the clergy and the schools, the population had many educated people.

50|$|In the {{description}} of burgage tenure and tenure in <b>villeinage,</b> the life of which consists in the validity of ancient customs recognised by law, we recognise survivals of a time before the iron rule of feudalism had moulded the law {{of land in the}} interests of the king and the great lords. Finally he deals with the law of rents, discussing the various kinds of rents that may be reserved to the grantor upon a grant of lands and the remedies for recovery of rent, especially the remedy by distress.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other types}} of serfs, villeins had to provide other services, {{possibly}} in addition to paying rent of money or produce. Villeins were somehow retained on their land and by unmentioned manners could not move away without their lord's consent and {{the acceptance of the}} lord to whose manor they proposed to migrate to. Villeins were generally able to hold their own property, unlike slaves. <b>Villeinage,</b> as opposed to other forms of serfdom, was most common in Continental European feudalism, where land ownership had developed from roots in Roman law.|$|E
50|$|Slavery in England {{had never}} been {{authorized}} by legal statutes. <b>Villeinage,</b> a form of semi-serfdom, was legally recognised but long obsolete. In 1772, a slave threatened with being taken out of England {{and returned to the}} Caribbean challenged the authority of his master, in what became known as Somersett's case. Lord Mansfield, Chief Justice of the King's Bench, ruled that as slavery had no standing under common law, slave owners were unable to transport slaves outside England and Wales against their will. Many observers took it to mean that slavery was ended in England.|$|E
50|$|Estates in {{free socage}} {{were the most}} macro-level of land {{division}} in New France but, within them, there existed several tenurial subdivisions. Immediately {{below the level of}} free socage was that of the <b>villeinage</b> (roture). Throughout New France, there came to exist several thousand estates in <b>villeinage.</b> Furthermore, these villein tenancies were remarkably uniform in terms of size. Barring extreme cases, it is estimated that around 95% of all villein estates were between 40 and 200 square arpents, or (7,680' ft and 38,400' ft) in size, though most were likely 120 arpents or less. Estates of less than 40 square arpents were considered to be of little value by villein socagers.To maximize simplicity when surveying, estates in villein socage were almost invariably distributed in rectangular plots following a rowed system wherein the first row bordered the river, and was the first to be filled, followed by the second behind it and so on. Typically, the proportions of such rectangles coincided with the ratio of 1:10 for width and length, respectively. However, extremes {{all the way up to}} 1:100 are known to have occurred. This method of land division confers obvious advantages in terms of easy access to transportation and cheap surveying, but also allowed socagers to live remarkably close to families on neighboring plots—often within a few hundred yards—creating something of a proto-neighborhood.|$|E
50|$|Szaparyovsky kastiel is a {{manor house}} on the east, lower from Burg and below the castle Považský hrad in Považská Bystrica municipality. Built was in 1676 {{probably}} by Peter Szapáray. In {{the interior of the}} manor was a chapel and school used by common people from the neighbourhood. Nowadays manor is left to dilapilate. In the vicinity of the manors was a cemetery with gravestones of Balassa family and garden with plants brought from around the world. In 1918 people driven by anger for the year under <b>villeinage</b> looted the manor. They burned books, destroyed everything that they found.|$|E
5000|$|The 13th {{century was}} characterised by {{patronage}} {{of the monarchy}} to the castle.

After his death his successor Stephen V visited the castle only twice, as it is reported in documents, in August 1270 and one year later when he confirmed the privilege to comes Ondrej (vogt of Banská Bystrica) for possession of part of the land.

In 1884 he had written an article in which he stated that [...] "we need make no mistake about the cause for which Wat Tyler and his worthier associate John Ball fell; they were fighting against the fleecing then in fashion, viz.; serfdom or <b>villeinage,</b> which was already beginning to wane before the advance of the industrial gilds." ...|$|E
50|$|The Manor of Sheltone 1297The {{main house}} with gardens {{and all its}} issues are worth three shillings.There are 240 acre worth yearly £7 at 6d per acre.

5000|$|When {{the rebels}} had dispersed, Ball was taken {{prisoner}} at Coventry, given {{a trial in}} which, unlike most, he was permitted to speak. He was hanged, drawn and quartered at St Albans {{in the presence of}} King Richard II on 15 July 1381. His head was displayed stuck on a pike on London Bridge, and the quarters of his body were displayed at four different towns. Ball, who was called by Froissart [...] "the mad priest of Kent," [...] seems to have possessed the gift of rhyme. He voiced the feelings of a section of the discontented lower orders of society at that time, who chafed at <b>villeinage</b> and the lords' rights of unpaid labour, or corvée.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{preserve}} each of the heirs' access to the river or road, the land would be divided lengthwise, resulting in narrower and narrower lots. In response to these increasingly subdivided farm plots and the issues of diminishing agricultural productivity associated with them, the Governor and the Intendant of New France petitioned the King in 1744 to issue a new ordinance rectifying the matter. The King responded by requiring the minimum plot size which a villein socager might cultivate or reside to be one arpent {{and a half of}} frontage by 30-40 arpents in depth. A final characteristic of <b>villeinage</b> is that the size of the fief typically varied in direct proportion with its distance from the nearest town, while its population density varied inversely.|$|E
50|$|After discussing, {{in their}} logical order, other {{freehold}} interests in land, he passes to interests in land that were called by later writers interests less than freehold - namely, tenancies for terms {{of years and}} tenancies at will. With the exception of tenancy from year to year, now so familiar to us, but which was a judicial creation of a date later than the time of Littleton, the first book is a complete statement {{of the principles of}} the common law, as they, for the most part, existed until 1925, governing and regulating interests in lands. The first book concludes with a very interesting chapter on copyhold tenures, which marks the exact point at which the tenant—by-copy-of-court-roll, the successor of the villein, who, in his turn, represented the freeman reduced to <b>villeinage</b> by the growth of the manorial system, acquired security of tenure.|$|E
