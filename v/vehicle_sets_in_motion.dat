40|$|Improving the {{traction}} {{performance of}} the electric railway vehicles requires an analysis to reduce their aerodynamic resistance. These <b>vehicles</b> cannot be <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> without an external power source, which demonstrates that the supply system is a key-element to their operation. The power source {{is located on the}} rooftop which basically results in an increase of their aerodynamic resistance. The present study discusses the aerodynamic resistance of the electric railway equipment such as pantographs, automatic circuit breaker, insulators, etc. The analyze is based on the equipment installed on the electric locomotive LE 060 EA of 5100 kW which is operational in Romania, emphasizing the pantographs role in capturing of electricity...|$|R
