25|$|The {{official}} Acorn RISC Machine project {{started in}} October 1983. They chose <b>VLSI</b> <b>Technology</b> as the silicon partner, {{as they were}} a source of ROMs and custom chips for Acorn. Wilson and Furber led the design. They implemented it with a similar efficiency ethos as the 6502. A key design goal was achieving low-latency input/output (interrupt) handling like the 6502. The 6502's memory access architecture had let developers produce fast machines without costly direct memory access (DMA) hardware.|$|E
25|$|Very-large-scale {{integration}} (VLSI) is {{the process}} of creating an integrated circuit (IC) by combining thousands of transistors into a single chip. VLSI began in the 1970s when complex semiconductor and communication technologies were being developed. The microprocessor is a VLSI device. Before the introduction of <b>VLSI</b> <b>technology</b> most ICs had a limited set of functions they could perform. An electronic circuit might consist of a CPU, ROM, RAM and other glue logic. VLSI allows IC makers to add all of these circuits into one chip.|$|E

25|$|The {{company was}} founded in November 1990 as Advanced RISC Machines Ltd and {{structured}} as {{a joint venture between}} Acorn Computers, Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) and <b>VLSI</b> <b>Technology.</b> The new company intended to further the development of the Acorn RISC Machine processor, which was originally used in the Acorn Archimedes and had been selected by Apple for their Newton project. Its first profitable year was 1993. The company's Silicon Valley and Tokyo offices were opened in 1994. Arm invested in Palmchip Corporation in 1997 to provide system on chip platforms and to enter into the disk drive market. In 1998 the Company changed its name from Advanced RISC Machines Ltd to ARM Ltd.

25|$|With the {{development}} of very-large-scale integration (<b>VLSI)</b> <b>technology,</b> Yannis Tsividis' group at Columbia University has been revisiting analog/hybrid computers design in standard CMOS process. Two VLSI chips have been developed, an 80th-order analog computer (250nm) by Glenn Cowan in 2005 and an 4th-order hybrid computer (65nm) developed by Ning Guo in 2015, both targeting at energy-efficient ODE/PDE applications. Glenn's chip contains 16 macros, {{in which there are}} 25 analog computing blocks, namely integrators, multipliers, fanouts, few nonlinear blocks. Ning's chip contains one macro block, in which there are 26 computing blocks including integrators, multipliers, fanouts, ADCs, SRAMs and DACs. Arbitrary nonlinear function generation is made possible by the ADC+SRAM+DAC chain, where the SRAM block stores the nonlinear function data. The experiments from the related publications revealed that VLSI analog/hybrid computers demonstrated about 1â€“2 orders magnitude of advantage in both solution time and energy while achieving accuracy within 5%, which points to the promise of using analog/hybrid computing techniques in the area of energy-efficient approximate computing.|$|E
