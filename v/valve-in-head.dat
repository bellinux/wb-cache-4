25|$|The Roadmaster was {{introduced}} {{in a year when}} Buick's <b>valve-in-head</b> straight-eight engines were heavily revised. Buick reduced the number of engines from four sizes to two: a 233-cubic-inch, 93-horsepower job for the Special, and a big, 320.2-cubic inch, 120-horsepower engine for the other series. (To put the size and power of Buick’s larger straight-eight engine in context, compare it to the new 322-cubic-inch mono-block 120 horsepower V-8 that Cadillac introduced that year.) In addition to this major engineering change 1936 was also the year Buick adopted an all steel turret top and hydraulic brakes. Coil springs were in the front.|$|E

5000|$|The Standard {{was offered}} in three body styles {{all on a}} 107-inch wheelbase: coach, coupe and coupe with rumble seat. All bodies were by Fisher and {{featured}} 'no-draft ventilation'. All models were powered by a [...] six-cylinder <b>valve-in-head</b> engine producing [...] at 3,000 rpm and 125 lbft Nm of torque giving the car {{a top speed of}} between 65-70 mph. This engine had first appeared in a Chevrolet in 1928. The car had full instrumentation. A clock, heater and a radio were options.|$|E
5000|$|The {{power train}} and chassis {{architecture}} introduced on the Model B was {{continued through the}} 1909 Model F. The early success of Buick is attributed {{in part to the}} <b>valve-in-head,</b> or overhead valve (OHV), engine patented by Eugene Richard and developed by David Dunbar Buick. The Model F had a two-cylinder engine, an 87-inch wheelbase and weighed 1,800 lbs. [...] The creation of General Motors is attributed in part to the success of Buick, so it can be said Marr and Richard's designs directly led to GM.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 1960, Belvederes got {{a brand-new}} {{standard}} inline six-cylinder engine replacing the venerable <b>valve-in-head</b> [...] "flathead" [...] six. Colloquially {{known as the}} slant-6, it displaced 225 cid L, featured overhead valves, and a block that was inclined 30 degrees {{to the right to}} permit a lower hood line with maximum displacement. This engine used a single-barrel Holley carburetor, and became known for its extremely rugged construction, exceptional reliability and longevity. V-8 engines continued to be optionally available, in displacements of 318 cid L and 361 cid L.|$|E

5000|$|Willard Velie, Jr. {{was named}} the company’s {{vice-president}} in 1927. He {{was the one who}} introduced the production of airplanes into the family business. They developed the first six-cylinder <b>valve-in-head</b> airplane motor in 1919. [...] They also developed a five-cylinder radial aircraft that powered their Velie Monocoupe. In 1926 Don Luscombe of Davenport, Iowa and Frank Wallace of Bettendorf, Iowa formed the Central States Aero Company and began building monocoupe airplanes. The Velie’s started working with the company and then bought it in 1928. [...] The result was Mono Aircraft, Inc., a subsidiary of Velie Motor Corporation.|$|E
5000|$|As the Type 1 Ho-Ki {{had been}} {{designed}} to carry supplies, pull artillery {{as well as to}} carry infantry, it had no rear exit hatch, it was felt that the towed weapon might interfere with the rapid exit of any onboard riflemen. Entry and exit of troops was thus accomplished from the left (driver's) side via three doors mounted side by side. The hull was welded construction and it was [...] "open-topped", akin to the Type 1 Ho-Ha. The engine, which was located at the right front of the body, was a 6-cylinder, in-line, <b>valve-in-head,</b> air-cooled diesel. The transmission was located in the rear.|$|E
50|$|For 1914, Scripps-Booth {{offered a}} three-passenger torpedo roadster, {{powered by a}} 103in3 (1702 cc) (2⅞×4-inch, 3½×102 mm) 18 hp (13 kW) {{water-cooled}} four-cylinder of <b>valve-in-head</b> design with Zenith carburetor and Atwater-Kent automatic spark advance. It featured a 110 in (2794 mm) wheelbase and 30×3½-inch (76×8.8-cm) Houk detachable wire wheels, with three speeds and (still a rarity then) shaft drive. With complete electrical equipment, from Bijur starter to ignition (on a separate switch from starter) to headlights to Klaxet electric horn (with a button in the steering hub, rather than a bulb) to pushbutton door locks, it sold for US$775, compared to US$700 for the Ford Model S (new in 1909), US$650 for the high-volume Oldsmobile Runabout, Ford's Model T at $550, Western's Gale Model A at US$500, the Black starting as low as $375, and the Success at an amazingly low US$250.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first two}} Buick {{automobiles}} {{were made in}} 1899 and 1900 at the [...] "Buick Auto-Vim and Power Company" [...] by chief-engineer Walter Marr, but David Buick was reluctant to begin making automobiles, being satisfied with stationary and marine engine production, so Marr left Buick in 1901 to found his own automobile company under his own name. His replacement was Eugene Richard, who applied for a patent in 1902 for Marr's <b>valve-in-head</b> engine, which patent, number 771,095, was awarded to Richard {{in the name of}} Buick in 1904. In 1903, the third Buick automobile was made, this time by Richard, but in 1904 Buick, whose company was now called [...] "Buick Motor Company," [...] moved to Flint, Michigan, and Richard stayed behind. Marr was rehired in Flint as chief engineer, to begin making automobiles in production. That year, 37 Buick automobiles were made, production increasing to 750 in 1905, 1,400 in 1906, 4,641 in 1907, and 8,800 in 1908, taking the number one spot away from close competitors Oldsmobile, Ford, and Maxwell.|$|E

5000|$|David Dunbar Buick {{incorporated}} {{his company}} as the Buick Motor Company on May 19, 1903, in Detroit, Michigan. In March, 1904, {{the company was}} purchased by Benjamin Briscoe, who quickly sold it to James H. Whiting (1842-1919), owner of Flint Wagon Works, in Flint, Michigan. Whiting moved Buick to Flint that summer, to a location {{across the street from}} his factory, with the idea of adding Buick's engines to his wagons. David Buick stayed on as a manager, and re-hired Walter Marr as chief engineer. The engine Buick and Marr developed for this automobile was a 2-cylinder <b>valve-in-head</b> engine of 159 cubic inches, with each cylinder horizontal and opposed to each other by 180 degrees. Whiting built only a few automobiles in 1904, by bringing Buick engines across the street where his workers shoehorned them into his wagons, before running out of capital, causing him to bring in William C. Durant that year as controlling investor. Durant was co-owner, also in Flint, of the Durant-Dort Carriage Company, which was the largest carriage-making company in the country. Durant spent the next 4 years turning Buick into the biggest-selling automobile brand in the US. David Buick sold his stock upon departure in 1906, and died in modest circumstances 25 years later. In 1907, Durant agreed to supply motors to R. S. McLaughlin in Canada, an auto maker, and in 1908 he founded General Motors.|$|E
