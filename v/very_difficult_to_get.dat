25|$|The {{only time}} the {{guillotine}} {{was used in}} North America was in Saint-Pierre in the late 19th century. Joseph Néel was convicted of killing Mr Coupard on Île aux Chiens on 30 December 1888, and executed by guillotine on 24 August 1889. The guillotine had to be shipped from Martinique {{and it did not}} arrive in working order. It was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> anyone to perform the execution; finally a recent immigrant was coaxed into doing the job. This event was the inspiration for the film The Widow of Saint-Pierre (La Veuve de Saint-Pierre) released in 2000. The guillotine is now in a museum in Saint-Pierre.|$|E
25|$|The waiver, {{which can}} be granted after the {{completion}} of an eight-hour course, is required for outpatient treatment of opioid addiction with Subutex and Suboxone. Initially, the number of patients each approved physician could treat was limited to ten. This was eventually modified to allow approved physicians to treat up to a hundred patients with buprenorphine for opioid addiction in an outpatient setting. This limit was recently increased by the Obama administration, raising the number of patients to which doctors can prescribe to 275. Still, due to this patient limit and the requisite eight-hour training course, many continuing patients can find it <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a prescription, despite the drug's effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|As {{of the end}} of 2003 {{there were}} up to 200,000 illegal {{immigrants}} in Canada (most residing in Ontario). Most are refugee claimants whose refugee applications were rejected by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. There are very few illegal immigrants who enter the country without first being examined by the CBSA. The {{reason for this is that}} Canada is physically <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to, with the exception of crossing the Canada/U.S. border. As the U.S. is itself a prime destination for illegal immigrants, not many illegal immigrants then attempt to cross the border into Canada in the wild. This differs significantly from the illegal immigration patterns in the U.S., which stem from illegal border crossings.|$|E

25|$|The festival draws {{thousands}} of Wagner fans to Bayreuth every summer. It is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> tickets, because demand (estimated at 500,000) greatly exceeds supply (58,000 tickets); the waiting time is {{between five and}} ten years (or more). The process entails submitting an order form every summer, applicants are usually successful after about ten years. Failure to make an application every year results in being placed {{at the back of}} the queue. Although some tickets are allocated by lottery, preference is given to members of the Society of Friends of Bayreuth (financial donors), famous patrons, and to regional and international Wagner societies, which are distributed to their own members through lottery or the willingness to pay a high contribution.|$|E
25|$|The {{common law}} is more {{malleable}} than statutory law. First, common law courts are not absolutely bound by precedent, but can (when extraordinarily good reason is shown) reinterpret and revise the law, without legislative intervention, {{to adapt to}} new trends in political, legal and social philosophy. Second, the common law evolves {{through a series of}} gradual steps, that gradually works out all the details, so that over a decade or more, the law can change substantially but without a sharp break, thereby reducing disruptive effects. In contrast to common law incrementalism, the legislative process is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> started, as legislatures tend to delay action until a situation is totally intolerable. For these reasons, legislative changes tend to be large, jarring and disruptive (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively, and sometimes with unintended consequences).|$|E
25|$|History {{indicates}} that Policarpa {{was not involved}} in politics before 1810, but by the time she moved back to Bogotá in 1817, she was actively participating in political issues. Because Bogotá was the stronghold of the Reconquista, where most of the population were Spanish Royalists and approved of the take over by Pablo Morillo, it was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{in and out of the}} city. Policarpa and her brother Bibiano entered the capital with forged documents and safeguards, and a letter of introduction written by Ambrosio Almeyda and José Rodríguez, two Revolutionary leaders; they recommended she and her brother stay in the house of Andrea Ricaurte y Lozano under cover of working as her servants. In reality Andrea Ricaurte's home was the centre of intelligence gathering and resistance in the capital.|$|E

25|$|Sweden has {{a system}} for credit scoring that aims to find people {{with a history of}} neglect to pay bills or, most commonly, taxes. Anyone who does not pay their debts on time, and fails to make {{payments}} after a reminder, will have their case forwarded to the Swedish Enforcement Authority which is a national authority for collecting debts. The mere appearance of a company, or government office, as a debtor to this authority will result in a record among private credit bureaus; however, this does not apply to individuals as debtors. This record is called a Betalningsanmärkning (non-payment record) and by law can be stored for three years for an individual and five years for a company. This kind of nonpayment record will make it <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a loan, rent an apartment, get telephone subscriptions, rent a car or get a job where you handle cash. The banks, also use income and asset figures in connection with loan assessments.|$|E
25|$|He was a {{tall and}} bulky person with a {{prominent}} stomach and invariably played with a clean shaven head without any hat or cap {{or any kind of}} head gear. He always wore very loose pants and after batting for a while or keeping wicket for sometime his shirt will be hanging out of the trousers and somebody must tuck it in, now and then. He had a rather ugly and uncouth stance at the wicket as he held his bat very low and bent his body forward so much that his head was practically in line with the top of the wickets. Those who watched him from the on side could only see his prominent hind portion of the body sticking up while the head, bat and the rest of Dilawar Hussain were hardly visible. However, he had a very sound defense and so it was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him out. He was the most selfish batsman that I have ever seen.|$|E
25|$|After {{the clash}} at Boitzenburg, Hohenlohe {{knew that the}} French were on the Berlin highway, which went {{northeast}} from Zehdenick to Prenzlau. So instead of continuing on the Lychen-Boitzenburg-Prenzlau road, which intersected with the Berlin highway, he veered northeast to Schönermark-Nordwestuckermark. At 4:00 AM on 28 October and the column reached Schönermark, only eight kilometers from Prenzlau. Hohenlohe held a council of war at which the officers argued whether to march east to Prenzlau or to go north to Pasewalk. A cavalry vedette reported that Prenzlau was clear of the French at 6:00 AM, so the march continued, though three hours were wasted before getting underway. It was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the column moving again and angry protests were heard from the starving soldiers. Schwerin led the column with a cuirassier regiment and a battery of horse artillery. The bulk of the infantry trailed behind Schwerin's vanguard and Oberst Prince Augustus of Prussia led the rear guard, which consisted of a cavalry regiment and an infantry battalion. Two dragoon regiments protected the right flank.|$|E

[...] Lulu and Kongo first arrived at the zoo on May 11, 1966.

Up until the time Lulu gave birth, it had been <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> captive gorilla mothers to raise their young in zoos because the babies would either be {{rejected}} by the mother or they would be taken away by the handlers. Pattycake was the first gorilla successfully born in captivity in New York.|$|E
500|$|Manley {{describes}} Headley as {{just under}} medium height with sloping shoulders. His movements were precise and economical on the cricket field; his cap was usually at a slight angle and his sleeves were buttoned {{down to the}} wrist. Wisden noted in 1933 that his timing and placement of the ball was perfect. Exceptionally quick on his feet, he watched the ball onto the bat {{more than any other}} batsman. According to Wisden, all his shots were equally good but most notable was his on drive played from the back foot. He hit the ball hard and was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out. He faced criticism for playing off the back foot so often, but R. C. Robertson-Glasgow believed his square cut, late cut, and hook were exceptionally good. Headley was particularly effective on bad batting wickets. C. L. R. James calculated that Headley averaged 39.85 and passed fifty on seven occasions in thirteen innings on difficult wickets. According to James's reckoning, Bradman in similar conditions passed fifty once, and averaged 16.66 in fifteen innings. Headley himself preferred batting when the odds favoured the bowlers as he had to go for his shots and play his natural attacking game. He stated: [...] "On a bad wicket, it was you and the bowler...no nonsense." ...|$|E
