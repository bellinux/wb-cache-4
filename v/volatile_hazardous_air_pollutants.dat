They also require large capital investments in heat recovery options and large amounts of real estate. Non-thermal VOHAP (<b>Volatile</b> Organic <b>Hazardous</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Pollutant)</b> {{emission control}} devices require additional maintenance. They also require the replacement of costly consumables such as activated carbon or they use large amounts of energy to regenerate the adsorbent. Large air flow rates and low VOHAP concentrations are frequently encountered in industrial processes. This combination of variables makes the capture and destruction or recovery of VOHAP emissions an extremely energy intensive task to perform. A new technology is being developed and tested that addresses all of these issues. It utilizes a novel combination of existing and proven technologies to solve all of these problems simultaneously.

40|$|Refinery {{operations}} {{have been associated}} {{with a wide variety of}} atmospheric emissions consisting of criteria <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> <b>volatile</b> organic components, <b>hazardous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> as well as other pollutants. With approximately 100 oil refineries in the Wider Caribbean region (WCR), hydrocarbons in this region pose significant environmental and human health risks. One of the oldest and largest refineries in the WCR is the Isla Refineriá, which is located on the island of Curaçao, and has been the basis of historical debates and conflict between the public and the local government over the environmental and human health risks. This research aims to establish baseline levels of ambient petrochemical emissions in Curaçao, specifically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), inhalable particulate matter (PM 10) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and to evaluate through comparative literature analysis and recommended public health guidelines the potential health risks in Curaçao. In addition, source elucidation of PAHs was conducted using concentration profiles, distribution profiles, binary diagnostic ratios and factor analysis. Passive air samplers with polyurethane foam collection disks (PAS-PUFs) were deployed in 2011 (n= 43) and in 2014 (n= 30) to measure ambient PAH concentrations. Ambient PAH concentrations ranged from 1. 2 ng/m 3 in 2011 and 27. 3 to 660. 1 ng/m 3 in 2014, demonstrating no temporal differences. However, there were highly significant spatial differences, with the samples downwind of the refinery having significantly higher ambient PAH concentrations than those upwind in 2014. Source elucidation revealed the ambient PAHs were dominated by petrogenic emission sources (i. e., refinery) in the 2011 and the 2014 downwind samples, whereas the 2014 upwind locations were equally influenced by both petrogenic (i. e., refinery) and pyrogenic (i. e., vehicle emissions) sources. Available hourly, daily and monthly PM 10 and SO 2 measurements were downloaded from June 2010 through December 2014 from two local air monitoring stations. Concentrations of both PM 10 and SO 2 in Curaçao are among the highest reported globally, demonstrating an increasing trend over time and exceed current public health guidelines recommended by local and international agencies. It is plausible that the residents of Curaçao may experience health effects often associated with PM 10 and SO 2, however the epidemiological evidence is inadequate to infer causality between health effects and long-term exposures. Using the USEPA’s risk analysis methodology the resulting cumulative lifetime cancer risk estimates from PAH inhalation were below the level of concern (1. 0 x 10 - 4). In contrast, by evaluating the potency adjusted concentrations relative to the most toxic compound (benzo[a]pyrene), age class (children and adults) extrapolated and site specific risks indicated levels exceeding the upper bound acceptable risk (1. 0 x 10 - 4) by almost two orders of magnitude suggesting the need for remediation...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Though many {{contaminants}} {{are released}} into the atmosphere, in the US only six air pollutants-ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and lead-are closely monitored and carefully assessed for health significance. Other pollutants, even if highly toxic, are neither widely monitored nor routinely assessed at the national level. The goal {{of this study was}} to analyze the availability of information needed to characterize the health significance of <b>hazardous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> focusing on urban areas in California. METHODS: The authors compared different approaches to identifying which contaminants should be considered <b>hazardous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> of potential health concern; reviewed the availability of toxicity values for these pollutants; and analyzed the usefulness of air monitoring data from California agencies for determining populations risks, by comparing method detection limits with health benchmarks. RESULTS: Approaches to identifying air contaminants of possible health concern differ. Toxicity values are not available for many <b>hazardous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> including those identified in the Clean Air Act. In California, monitoring data are available for many, though not all, pollutants of concern. Monitoring methods for several pollutants do not have adequate sensitivity to detect all relevant concentrations.

40|$|AbstractThe air {{monitors}} used by most {{regulatory authorities}} {{are designed to}} track the daily emissions of conventional pollutants and are not well suited for measuring <b>hazardous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> that are released from accidents such as refinery fires. By applying {{a wide variety of}} air-monitoring systems, including on-line Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector, and off-line gas chromatography–mass spectrometry for measuring <b>hazardous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> during and after a fire at a petrochemical complex in central Taiwan on May 12, 2011, we were able to detect significantly higher levels of combustion-related gaseous and particulate pollutants, refinery-related hydrocarbons, and chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as 1, 2 -dichloroethane, vinyl chloride monomer, and dichloromethane, inside the complex and 10 km downwind from the fire than those measured during the normal operation periods. Both back trajectories and dispersion models further confirmed that high levels of <b>hazardous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> in the neighboring communities were carried by air mass flown from the 22 plants that were shut down by the fire. This study demonstrates that <b>hazardous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> from industrial accidents can successfully be identified and traced back to their emission sources by applying a timely and comprehensive air-monitoring campaign and back trajectory air flow models...|$|R

50|$|The primary {{piece of}} federal {{legislation}} governing the airborne release of mercury in the United States is the Clean Air Act. Unlike the criteria <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> mercury is classified under the Act as a <b>hazardous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> {{and is thus}} subject to control under the National Emissions Standards for <b>Hazardous</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Pollutants</b> (NESHAP's) rather than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The key distinction is that the former is controlled by establishing performance standards under a program known as maximum achievable control technology standards (MACT), designed to reduce <b>hazardous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions to a maximum achievable degree, by setting a standard at least as stringent as the emission reductions achieved by {{the average of the}} top 12% best controlled in the same pollution sources. However, as of early 2011, no federal limits of mercury from coal and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units (EGU's) were on the books. The development of a regulatory policy framework to guide the emissions of mercury from power plants is on-going, the major developments of which have occurred largely within the last decade.|$|R

40|$|<b>Hazardous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> are {{regulated}} under Title III of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. The Amendments replace the risk-based approach mandated in the 1977 Amendments with a prescriptive, technology-based approach requiring that maximum achievable control technology (MACT) {{be applied to}} all major industrial sources of 189 <b>hazardous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutants.</b> The change reflects political, rather than scientific consensus that the public health benefits justify the costs.

Particular emphasis is given to examining the interrelationships among facts (science), judgments (science policy), and policy (values) {{in the context of the}} risk assessment paradigm. Science and policy are discussed in relation to Title III, contrasting the political consensus for action with the scientific uncertainty about risks and benefits.

40|$|With {{the release}} of MOBILE 6. 2, EPA has {{integrated}} the calculation of <b>hazardous</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> emission factors into the MOBILE 6 modeling framework. Using toxic emissions data and algorithms from EPA’s Complex Model for Reformulated Gasoline, MOBILE 6. 2 estimates emission factors for benzene, 1, 3 -butadiene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, and Methyl Tert-Butyl Ether (MTBE). These algorithms require a number of fuel parameter inputs which are not required for the estimation of criteria pollutants, such as benzene content, aromatics content, and olefin content.
