Gordon developed the idea into an X-File involving possession by a gargoyle spirit. He wrote a draft script for the episode but had to turn to series creator Chris Carter three days before production began in order to rework it. The two worked on the script over the weekend to add more psychological aspects to the episode. Gordon claimed to be <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final product. Assistant Art Director Gary Allen drew the gargoyle sketches used in this episode.|$|E

It played at the Hurrah! club in New York City {{before moving on to}} the Alcazar Theatre in San Francisco. Divine would remain <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work, seeing it as evidence that his acting skills were coming to wider recognition, and his performances were attended by such celebrities as Eartha Kitt, Elton John and Liza Minnelli. It was during the New York leg of the play's tour that Divine befriended Jay Bennett; they subsequently began renting an apartment together on 58th Street. In the city, Divine assembled a group of friends that {{came to be known as}} his [...] "New York family": designer Larry LeGaspi, makeup artist Conrad Santiago, Vincent Nasso and dresser Frankie Piazza.

[...] He describes the episode as a commentary on [...] "people who like things {{just the way they}} are", and remarks, [...] "It never seems to have occurred to anyone that this episode is about the people who hate it." [...] However, Keeler says that some of the dialogue was changed from his original draft, making this point less obvious. Oakley and Weinstein explain that they wanted to push the boundaries of the series while working as show-runners, and advise viewers to treat [...] "The Principal and the Pauper" [...] as an [...] "experiment". They surmise that the negative reception was partly {{due to the fact that}} it was not immediately apparent to viewers that this was such an episode (as opposed to, for example, [...] "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"). They also describe the ending of the episode as an attempt to reset the continuity and allow fans to consider the episode as non-canonical, divorced from the larger series.|$|E

He matriculated at New College, Oxford in 1888 and graduated with a second-class degree in history in 1892; again he was not noted as a particularly outstanding student, which was attributed to the time he spent enjoying himself rather than studying. Despite his lack of academic brilliance he was invited to present the Romanes Lecture in 1949, an honour normally only given to the most eminent alumni of Oxford.
