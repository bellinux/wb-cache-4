40|$|Understanding the {{problems}} faced by rural extension in Uruguay {{as well as the}} conceptions used by the development agents to conduct their practices constitutes a contribution to both, the Uruguayan rural development policies and the wider space of the MERCOSUR. A quali-quantitative research was conducted, during which 32 Uruguayan extensionists <b>replied</b> to a <b>questionnaire.</b> <b>Replies</b> underwent content and statistic analysis. Results suggest that the Uruguayan rural extensionists posses a complex conception of their practice, which articulates productive and social dimensions and relates to a critical and participatory way of understanding rural extension. Nevertheless, a diffusionist conception of rural extension is also present in some cases. Finally, problems related to group dynamics are highlighted. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{simulation}} model developed for prediction {{of the electric}} load profile of a residential area is briefly outlined in the paper. The model based on a "bottom-up" approach in order to reproduce customers' daily behaviour concerning elcctricity usage, has been applied for validation to reproduce load diagrams of a sample residential area where field measurements of power demand arid a combined mail survey had been previously conducted. Since the residential electric load was almost exclusively of the discretionary, weather-independent type, the survey ques tionnairc regarded mainly thc lifestyle of customers, thus evidencing the need for probabilistic processing of the data collected by the survey. To this end customers' presence at home and appliance usage have been considered as normal distributions around a incan value as ensued from the survey data. In the paper, a sensitivity analysis is performed on standard deviation values of the above distributions, which allows quite good matching of recorded data with simulation risults. A heuristic approach is proposed for correcting the dispersions of normal distributions {{to compensate for the}} averaging inherent in the <b>questionnaire</b> <b>replies</b> compared with actual random behaviour of the persons concerne...|$|R

A history of wheezing was obtained in 16 · 2 per cent; 1 · 8 percent had had wheezing alone, while the majority (14 - 4 per cent) gave a history of both wheezing and productive cough. Productive cough alone was reported in a further 32 · 5 per cent The parents reported that 17 · 1 per cent of seven-year-old children had {{more than two or three}} colds a year, 5 - 7 per cent had 2 ̆ 7 hay fever’, and 6 - 8 per cent had both. There was a close association between upper and lower respiratory symptoms, the prevalence of upper respiratory symptoms ranging from 15 - 5 per cent in those with no lower respiratory symptoms to 60 · 4 per cent in those with a history of both wheezing and productive cough. Despite considerable overlap, “colds” tended to be associated with productive cough and 2 ̆ 7 hay fever 2 ̆ 7 with wheezing. According to the <b>questionnaire</b> <b>replies,</b> lower respiratory symptoms were commoner (48 · 6 percent) than upper respiratory symptoms (29 · 6 percent). Episodes of productive cough were longer in duration, less frequent and started later in life than episodes of wheezing. Those with a history of both wheezing and productive cough resembled those with wheezing alone more closely than those with productive cough alone, but tended to be more severely affected than those with wheezing alone. Eczema and other indices of atopy were associated with a history of wheezing, and also, after elimination of the effect of wheezing, with hay fever. In this respect those with productive cough alone and those with colds alone did not differ significantly from those without symptoms.

The researchers delivered 2, 952 questionnaires via Internet, e-mail and airmail in January 2008. Finally, 1, 549 <b>questionnaires</b> <b>replied</b> back and turned out to be ok. The findings were described as below. The situation of “high-tech schools, low-access technology” also happened in Taipei primary schools. The time teachers devote to use technology into instruction is about 1 - 3 hour(s) per week and the level of technology implementation to use was low. Besides, teachers’ self-efficacy and task values have impact on their commitment and effort on technology-instruction integration. Teachers’ age and the length of teaching presented opposite correlations with their commitment and effort on technology-instruction integration. Teachers have huge difficulty on comprehending and designing computer-animation related multimedia materials to help students clear their abstract learning concept to concrete. In the future, they hope to take more workshops related with multimedia design principles, how to integrate technology with learning areas, and other multimedia related theories...|$|R
40|$|Motor imagery (MI) is {{a mental}} {{representation}} of motor behavior {{that has been}} widely used as a control method for a brain-computer interface (BCI), allowing communication for the physically impaired. The performance of MI based BCI mainly depends on the subject's ability to self-modulate EEG signals. Proper training can help naive subjects learn to modulate brain activity proficiently. However, training subjects typically involves abstract motor tasks and is time-consuming. To improve the performance of naive subjects during motor imagery, a novel paradigm was presented that would guide naive subjects to modulate brain activity effectively. In this new paradigm, pictures of {{the left or right}} hand were used as cues for subjects to finish the motor imagery task. Fourteen healthy subjects (11 male, aged 22 - 25 years, mean 23. 6 +/- 1. 16) participated in this study. The task was to imagine writing a Chinese character. Specifically, subjects could imagine hand movements following the sequence of writing strokes in the Chinese character. This paradigm was meant to find an effective and familiar action for most Chinese people, to provide them with a specific, extensively practiced task and help them modulate brain activity. Results showed that the writing task paradigm yielded significantly better performance than the traditional arrow paradigm (p< 0. 001). <b>Questionnaire</b> <b>replies</b> indicated that most subjects thought the new paradigm was easier and more comfortable. The proposed new motor imagery paradigm could guide subjects to help them modulate brain activity effectively. Results showed that there were significant improvements using new paradigm, both in classification accuracy and usability...|$|R
