40|$|This study uses {{changes in}} <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequency</b> to {{quantify}} the physiological response of an Australian terrestrial herbivore, the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), to olfactory cues suggesting the presence of potential predators. <b>Ventilatory</b> <b>frequency</b> {{proved to be a}} quantifiable measure to assess the response of this macropod marsupial to olfactory cues. <b>Ventilatory</b> <b>frequency</b> increased from mean resting levels of 45 ± 5. 1 breaths min– 1 to 137 ± 11. 2 breaths min– 1 during the first minute of exposure to all odours. These physiological responses diminished over time, with <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequency</b> in the first minute after introduction of the scents greater than that during the subsequent four, suggesting that the initial reaction was due to disturbance and was investigative in nature. However, the ratio of <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequency</b> in the remaining 4 min after introduction of the odours compared with before was greater for fox (3. 58 ± 0. 918) and cat (2. 44 ± 0. 272) odours than for snake (2. 27 ± 0. 370), distilled water (1. 81 ± 0. 463) and quoll (1. 71 ± 0. 245) odours, suggesting that fox and cat odour provoked a greater response. However, the wallabies’ response to the odour of these introduced predators and to horse odour (2. 40 ± 0. 492) did not differ. Our study indicates that a long period of co-history with particular predators is not a prerequisite for detection of potentially threatening species. We do not find any support for the hypothesis that an inability to interpret olfactory cues to detect and respond to potential predation by introduced predators is responsible for the decline of these macropod marsupials...|$|E

30|$|In {{this paper}} we {{designed}} a realistic respiratory muscle pressure {{to drive a}} mechanical lung such as the ASL 5000. In order to do that, we started from the scarce data available in the literature to define the main properties of the dynamics underlying the pressure driven by the respiratory muscles. Using an electrical analogy, we used two exponential functions, one for inspiration and one for expiration. In {{order to have a}} muscular dynamics only depending on the <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequency</b> and the mouth occlusion pressure — two clinical parameters commonly measured —, we introduced a linear dependency between the ratio of the inspiratory duration to the breathing cycle duration and the <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequency</b> as suggested by clinical evidences. The resulting model was validated by comparing simulated airflow time series measured in the mechanical lung driven by our model with those measured in ventilatory circuits with patients. By varying the <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequency</b> and the mouth occlusion pressure we are now able to reproduce the inter-patient variability and, consequently, to investigate performances of ventilators on a “cohort” of realistic lung models.|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} {{of patients with}} a bronchopleural fistula (BPF) undergoing surgery or respiratory support in Intensive Care involves complex decision making. The two most commonly used types of artificial ventilation are Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (IPPV) and High Frequency Jet Ventilation (HFJV). Each of these have advantages and disadvantages and the clinician must balance {{the need to maintain}} an adequate tidal volume for gas exchange against the risks of increasing gas leak through the BPF caused by the higher pressures and volumes which may be required. In this thesis, experiments investigating the effects of HFJV and IPPV on ventilation and leak volumes whilst ventilating various sizes and positions of simulated BPFs are described. A survey was also conducted to gauge the current airway {{management of}} BPFs by specialist anaesthetists in the UK. A bench top model was used to ventilate (HFJV or IPPV) standard artificial ‘test’ lungs and/or cadaveric porcine lungs whilst data were collected (i. e. entrained/expired/leak volumes). Whilst ventilating with HFJV, leak and entrained volumes were shown to increase progressively with more proximally situated BPFs, whereas the measured expired volume decreased.

40|$|The {{complete}} {{equation of}} motion for a single compartment model (SCM) includes an inertance term to describe pressure changes in phase with acceleration, as well as terms for resistance and elastance. Inertance has traditionally been excluded from the model when measuring respiratory mechanics at conventional <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequencies</b> in mature respiratory systems. However, this omission has been questioned recently for measurements of respiratory mechanics in intubated infants where higher ventilation frequencies and smaller tracheal tubes are the norm. We investigated 1) the significance of inertance in an immature respiratory system during mechanical ventilation, and 2) the effect of omitting it from the model on estimates of respiratory mechanics. Six anesthetised, paralysed and mechanically ventilated puppies (2. 6 - 3. 9 kg) were studied. A SCM, including an inertance term was fitted to measurements of flow and airway opening (P(AO)) or transpulmonary (P(TP)) pressure using multiple linear regression to estimate respiratory system and lung resistance (R(RS), R(L)), elastance (E(RS), E(L)) and inertance (I(RS), I(L)) respectively, at various ventilation frequencies (0. 2 - 2 Hz). Data obtained at each ventilation frequency were also fitted with a similar model without the inertance term. Inertance {{contributed significantly to the}} model at frequencies greater than approximately 0. 3 - 0. 5 Hz (20 - 30 breaths per minute), with I(RS) dominated by the lung. The importance of including the inertance term in the model increased as ventilation frequency increased. Exclusion of inertance from the model led to underestimation of E(RS) and E(L), but no errors in estimates of R(RS) or R(L). The errors increased with ventilation frequency to ~ 10 - 20 % for E(RS) and ~ 10 - 40 % for E(L) at 2 Hz. While inertance contributed significantly to the SCM at ventilation frequencies typically required to maintain normal gas exchange in puppies, the errors from excluding this term were small...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY To {{determine}} if {{functional residual capacity}} (FRC), compliance of the respiratory system (C), or underlying pulmonary disease are predictive for the efficacy of high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) on pulmonary gas exchange, we investigated six adult patients within 4 h of abdominal surgery and six patients with severe adult respiratory distress syndrome. Gas exchange during intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) was compared with that during HFJV at frequencies of 100 b. p. m. (HFJV 100) and 200 b. p. m. (HFJV 200), resulting in a minute ventilation of about 400 ml kg− 1 with both <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and in both groups of patients. Baseline FRC and C were measured during IPPV with the multiple-breath nitrogen washout method and from expiratory pressure-volume curves, respectively. Changes in the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (PAO 2 −PaO 2) : FlO 2 ratio induced by HFJV correlated negatively with C (HFJV 100 : r = − 0. 78, P < 0. 005; HFJV 200 : r = − 0. 84, P < 0. 005); that is, greater oxygenation was obtained in patients with a better compliance. Similarly, changes in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Paco 2) induced by HFJV correlated negatively with C (HFJV 100 : r = − 0. 77, P < 0. 001; HFJV 200 : r = — 0. 61, P < 0. 05). In contrast, {{there was no significant}} correlation between FRC measured during IPPV and changes in (PAO 2 −PaO 2) : FlO 2 ratio or Paco 2 induced by HFJV, as these changes were influenced more by the patient's pulmonary disease than by baseline FRC.

At 15 °C, the mean basal oxygen consumption of G. australis caught immediately after they had left the sea and embarked on the spawning run (45 mgrl · g- 1 · h- 1) was less than in young adults about to commence their marine feeding phase (64 mgrl · g- 1 · h- 1), but greater than in large ammocoetes (26. 5 mgrl · g- 1 · h- 1). Basal oxygen consumption fell progressively during the spawning-run of to 33 mgrl · g- 1 · h- 1 after 5 months and 25 mgrl · g- 1 · h- 1 after 10 months, before rising to 35 mgrl · g- 1 · h- 1 after 15 months when the animals were approaching sexual maturity. The downwards trend in basal oxygen consumption contrasts with that recorded during the spawning run of Lampetra fluviatilis. Furthermore, these values for spawning-run of G. australis are far lower than those measured {{at any time during}} the upstream migration of L. fluviatilis or during the parasitic phase of landlocked Petromyzon marinus.

40|$|Three piglets were {{ventilated}} with a TVM-ventilator, which releases predetermined {{volumes of}} compressed gas into the airways. The inspiratory flow {{depends on the}} pressure and volume of the compressed gas and compliance, resistance and inertia of the lungs, thorax and abdomen of the subject. The time for half filling of the chest was {{less than that of}} the abdomen and the difference increased with high driving pressure (with high acceleration). The difference was thus most probably a result of greater inertia of the abdomen. Inertia also seemed to influence the emptying of the lungs. This was so slow that increase of FRC—air trapping—was seen at a <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequency</b> of 30 b. pjn. The practical consequences of these findings are that the abdomen (diaphragm) will take less and less part in ventilation and that a phase lag between chest and abdominal breathing should become larger with increasing <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequency.</b> FRC will increase in regions with expiratory obstruction and lung rupture may follow.

30|$|Adaptive {{ventilation}} modes {{are designed}} to automate {{some of the basic}} actions of clinicians as they attempt to identify the best settings, although the definition of “best” continues {{to be a matter of}} debate. The algorithms usually adapt to the changing characteristics of the patient, such as mechanics (resistance, compliance, and inspiratory effort) or <b>ventilatory</b> pattern (<b>frequency</b> and tidal volume), and choose an appropriate response. One strategy to incorporate clinical knowledge into machine design is to use what is called an optimum targeting scheme [1], a term adapted from engineering control theory. An optimum targeting scheme is based on a mathematical model that attempts to minimize or maximize some desired outcome. In optimization theory, that model is also called a cost function. This function tells the machine how much a ventilation pattern “costs” in terms of predefined criteria. These criteria are based on actual patient characteristics (e.g., the cost function could simply describe tidal volume dosage). Hence, the goal of an optimum targeting scheme is to find the ventilation pattern with the lowest cost. If this optimum pattern is found, it can be used to set values (targets) for the underlying controllers. For a detailed description of how optimal targeting schemes work, see the Additional file  1.|$|R
40|$|The normal {{breathing}} {{pattern of the}} turtle, Chrysemys picta (Schneider), consists of periods of continuous breathing interspersed with periods of breath holding. During each <b>ventilatory</b> period respiratory <b>frequency</b> and tidal volume are controlled independently. There is a large variability in inspiratory and expiratory gas-flow rates yet tidal volumes are maintained within narrow limits by adjustments of the lengths of the active inspiratory and expiratory intervals. Lung volume information carried within the vagus nerve {{is responsible for the}} careful regulation of tidal volume as well as for modulation of the air flow rates and lowering of the threshold of the mechan-ism initiating expiration following breath holding. Increases in pulmonary minute ventilation during hypercapnia are caused by increases in respiratory frequency due solely to a shortening of the periods of breath holding. There is some increase in tidal volume but the breath length remains constant and thus the frequency of breathing within each ventilatory period also remains constant. After vagotomy, changes in minute ventilation due to hypercapnia stem primarily from changes in tidal volume while changes in respiratory frequency are greatly reduced...|$|R

Males with "intermediate" temperament expressed frequencies between the two extremes of the continuum. Also, and as predicted, temperament had an influence on these individuals’ activity and exploratory behaviour: “bold” and “intermediate” males were simultaneously more active and showed a significantly higher exploratory behaviour than "shy" males.

The results of the studies reviewed showed a strong level of evidence to support the impairment of heart rate variability in the time domain. A similar evidence level was also found to support impairment in baroreceptor sensitivity and muscle sympathetic nerve activity. Furthermore, this review identified physical activity level, muscle function, and circadian rhythm as the major influencing factors (strong evidence) of autonomic function in subjects with COPD.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Both pulse {{pressure}} variation and stroke volume variation during intermittent positive-pressure ventilation predict preload responsiveness. However, because <b>ventilatory</b> and cardiac <b>frequencies</b> {{are not the}} same, {{increasing the number of}} breaths sampled may increase calculated pulse {{pressure variation}} and stroke volume variation because larger (max) and smaller (min) pulse pressure and stroke volume may occur. Tidal volume and contractility may also alter pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation. We hypothesized that the magnitude of pulse pressure variation would increase with sampling duration, and that both tidal volume and contractility would independently alter pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation. METHODS: In seven pentobarbital-anesthetized intact dogs arterial and left ventricular pressure (Millar) and left ventricular volume (Leycom) were measured over 8 intermittent positive-pressure ventilation breaths at tidal volume of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mL/kg (f ≤ 20 /min, 40 % inspiratory time) under baseline, esmolol (2 mg/min), dobutamine infusions (5 μg/kg/min) and following volume loading (500 mL NaCl). Stroke volume variation was calculated using pulse contour method (PiCCO, Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany) averaged over 12 secs. Pulse pressure variation was calculated as 100 × (PPmax - PPmin) /PPmean and calculated over 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 breaths. RESULTS: Pulse pressure variation increased progressively with increasing sampling duration up to but not exceeding five breaths. The effect on sampling duration was increased by greater tidal volume. Esmolol infusion decreased both pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation as compared with baseline (p < 0. 05) at all tidal volume levels. However, dobutamine did not alter either pulse pressure variation or stroke volume variation. CONCLUSION: Sampling duration, tidal volume, and beta-adrenergic blockade differentially alters pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation during intermittent positive-pressure ventilation. Thus, separate validation is required to define threshold pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation values used to drive resuscitation algorithms. © 2008 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R

40|$|Hypoxia {{increases}} {{the release of}} neurotransmitters from chemoreceptor cells of the carotid body (CB) and the activity in the carotid sinus nerve (CSN) sensory fibers, elevating ventilatory drive. According to previous reports, perinatal hyperoxia causes CSN hypotrophy and varied diminishment of CB function and the hypoxic ventilatory response. The present study aimed to characterize the presumptive hyperoxic damage. Hyperoxic rats were born and reared for 28 days in 55 %– 60 % O 2; subsequent growth (to 3. 5 – 4. 5 months) was in a normal atmosphere. Hyperoxic and control rats (born and reared in a normal atmosphere) responded with a similar increase in <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequency</b> to hypoxia and hypercapnia. In comparison with the controls, hyperoxic CBs showed (1) half the size, but comparable percentage area positive to tyrosine hydroxylase (chemoreceptor cells) in histological sections; (2) a twofold increase in dopamine (DA) concentration, but a 50 % reduction in DA synthesis rate; (3) a 75 % reduction in hypoxia-evoked DA release, but normal high [K+] 0 -evoked release; (4) a 75 % {{reduction in the number}} of hypoxia-sensitive CSN fibers (although responding units displayed a nearly normal hypoxic response); and (5) a smaller percentage of chemoreceptor cells that increased [Ca 2 +] 1 in hypoxia, although responses were within the normal range. We conclude that perinatal hyperoxia causes atrophy of the CB–CSN complex, resulting in a smaller number of chemoreceptor cells and fibers. Additionally, hyperoxia damages O 2 -sensing, but not exocytotic, machinery in most surviving chemoreceptor cells. Although hyperoxic CBs contain substantially smaller numbers of chemoreceptor cells/sensory fibers responsive to hypoxia they appear sufficient to evoke normal increases in <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequency...</b>|$|E

From Day 1 or Day 7, animals received, during three months, a weekly oral bolus of either cholecalciferol, at the dose of 500 IU/kg/day, or vehicle, namely triglycerides. Rats were assessed every month, using a ladder test for sensori-locomotor ability and neuromuscular capacity. Three months after injury, H-reflex was recorded from left extensor digitorum muscle {{in order to measure}} the reflexivity of the sub-lesional region. <b>Ventilatory</b> <b>frequency</b> was also monitored during an electrically induced muscle fatigue of the hindlimb known to enhance muscle metaboreflex and increase respiratory rate. After recording the phrenic nerve activity, ipsilateral to the lesion, during spontaneous breathing, animals were artificially ventilated while paralyzed with a neuromuscular blocking agent and then the brainstem respiratory centres were provoked to maximal output by temporarily stopping the ventilator. Spinal cords were immunostained with an anti-neurofilament antibody to evaluate axon numbers. We show here that vitamin D-treated animals display i) an enhanced locomotor activity, ii) an improved breathing when hindlimb muscle was electrically stimulated to induce fatigue, iii) an H-reflex depression similar to control animals, iv) a phrenic nerve activity response to a temporary asphyxial stress and v) a non significant decreased number of axons in the proximal stump when compared with the Sham group.

Insufficient alveolar pressure may cause tidal recruitment/derecruitment of the alveoli, exposing the regions to shear stress (Ochiai 2015). A recent animal study demonstrated that IRV minimized cyclic recruitment and derecruitment of atelectasis and improved oxygenation compared with the conventional mode (Boehme et al. 2015). This was accompanied by redistribution of ventilation from the nondependent to dependent lung regions (Kotani et al. 2016). Because the <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequency</b> during IRV was 31 – 57  breaths/min in our cohort, the very short expiratory time contributed to stabilization of the alveoli in accordance with the longer inspiratory time.|$|E
40|$|Rapid shallow {{breathing}} index (RSBI, respiratory frequency [f] divided by tidal volume [Vt]) {{has been used}} to prognosticate liberation from mechanical ventilation (LMV). We hypothesize that dynamic changes in RSBI predict failed LMV better than isolated RSBI measurements. We conducted a retrospective study of patients who were mechanically ventilated (MV) for longer than 72 hours. Failed LMV was defined as need for reinstitution of MV within 48 hours post-LMV. <b>Ventilatory</b> <b>frequency</b> (f) and Vt (liters) were serially recorded. The instantaneous RSBI (i-RSBI) was defined as f/Vt. Dynamic f/Vt ratio (d-RSBI) was defined as the ratio between two consecutive i-RSBI (f/Vt) measurements ([f 2 /Vt 2]/[f 1 /Vt 1]). RSBI Product (RSB-P) was defined as (i-RSBI × d-RSBI). Data from 32 patients were analyzed (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II 13. 4, male 69...|$|E
40|$|Forty-five boys {{undergoing}} {{repair of}} hypospadias were allocated randomly {{to one of}} two groups. After induction of anaesthesia, 22 patients received 0. 25 % caudal bupivacaine 0. 5 ml kg- 1 and diamorphine 30 micrograms kg- 1 and the remaining 23 patients received 0. 25 % caudal bupivacaine 0. 5 ml kg- 1 alone. Pain scores (Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale), sedation scores, <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequency,</b> analgesic requirements and associated side effects were recorded for the first 24 h after operation. The two groups were indistinguishable in age, weight and duration of surgery. There was a statistically significant reduction in early pain scores. There was also a statistically significant increase in the time to first passage of urine in those boys in the diamorphine group who were not catheterized during operation...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} use of {{extradural}} diamorphine for postoperative analgesia as a nurse-based service on selected surgical wards in a district general hospital. Eight hundred patients received lumbar or thoracic extradural diamorphine analgesia for postoperative or traumatic pain. Diamorphine was administered in bolus form by suitably trained nursing staff. Satisfactory analgesia, recorded on a verbal rating scale {{at the conclusion of}} the service, was achieved in 94. 6 % of patients. The technique was considered by medical and nursing staff to be a safe and acceptable method of analgesia. Respiratory depression, defined as a <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequency</b> of less than 10 b. p. m., occurred in seven patients (incidence of 0. 9 %). All occurred in the theatre recovery area or in the intensive care unit. Retro-spectively, each was predictable and all responded to naloxone 0. 4 mg...|$|E
40|$|The {{respiratory}} {{effects of}} several benzodiazepine (BZ) agonists and inverse agonists {{were compared with}} those of buspirone and pentobarbital in awake rhesus monkeys. Subjects, fitted with a helmet that served as a pressure displacement plethys-mograph, were studied in a ventilated, sound-attenuating cham-ber; <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequency,</b> tidal volume (VT) and minute volume (Vs) were determined from the plethysmograph signal. During experimental sessions monkeys inhaled either 5 % carbon dioxide (C 02) mixed in air or air alone according to a fixed alternating schedule. BZ agonists (alprazolam, 0. 01 - 1. 0 mg/kg; lorazepam, 0. 3 - 1 0. 0 mg/kg; quazepam, 1. 0 - 5. 6 mg/kg) decreased VT and VE during both 5 % CO 2 and air inhalation.

40|$|Tramadol {{may cause}} {{awareness}} and EEG activation during anaesthesia. We compared tramadol with morphine, administered during wound-closure, surmising that tramadol may cause earlier awakening, more rapid recovery, less respiratory depression and equivalent pain relief. Forty patients received nitrous oxide-enflurane for abdominal surgery. At wound closure, patients received tramadol 3 mg kg- 1 or morphine 0. 2 mg kg- 1 and end-tidal enflurane concentrations were maintained at 0. 5 kPa until skin closure, whereupon anaesthesia was discontinued. Times to spontaneous respiration, awakening and orientation {{were similar in}} the two groups, as were blood-gas tensions, <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequency,</b> pain scores and incidence of nausea. Half of each group required supplementary analgesia during their 90 -min stay in the recovery room. P-deletion counts improved more rapidly in the tramadol group. This study confirms previous reports that tramadol did not antagonize the hypnotic effects of volatile anaesthetics. Tramadol, administered during operation, was as effective as morphine in providing postoperative analgesia while permitting more rapid psychomotor recovery. Articl...|$|E
30|$|Recent {{research}} results provide new incentives {{to recognize and}} prevent ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and create targeting schemes for new modes of mechanical ventilation. For example, minimization of breathing power, inspiratory power, and inspiratory pressure are the underlying goals of optimum targeting schemes used in the modes called adaptive support ventilation (ASV), adaptive ventilation mode 2 (AVM 2), and MID-frequency ventilation (MFV). We describe the mathematical models underlying these targeting schemes and present theoretical analyses for minimizing tidal volume, tidal pressure (also known as driving pressure), or tidal power as functions of <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequency.</b> To go beyond theoretical equations, these targeting schemes were compared in terms of expected tidal volumes using different patient models. Results indicate {{that at the same}} ventilation efficiency (same PaCO 2 level), we expect tidal volume dosage in the range of 7.4  mL/kg (for ASV), 6.2  mL/kg (for AVM 2), and 6.7  mL/kg (for MFV) for adult ARDS simulation. For a neonatal RDS model, we expect 5.5  mL/kg (for ASV), 4.6  mL/kg (for AVM 2), and 4.5 (for MFV).|$|E
30|$|The optimal {{targeting}} schemes {{described above}} {{have one thing}} in common: for a given required alveolar minute ventilation and set of lung mechanics (for passive ventilation), they all suggest a <b>ventilatory</b> <b>frequency</b> that is optimal in some way (along with the associated optimal tidal volume). For a given alveolar minute ventilation, there are only two parameters which are free to vary (alveolar volume and frequency), and there are virtually infinite combinations. These targeting schemes offer three different ways to make the optimal selections. ASV is based on a model of unassisted breathing (sinusoidal pressure waveform driving function), under the assumption that the optimal tidal volume and frequency are those that would be picked by the patient’s brain to minimize power output of the muscles. AVM 2 is based on a model of assisted breathing (square pressure waveform driving function) and selects tidal volume and frequency such that inspiratory power will be minimized to possibly avoid ventilator-induced lung injury. Likewise, MFV was invented with the intention of serving lung protective ventilation by choosing the frequency that minimizes inspiratory pressure.|$|E
