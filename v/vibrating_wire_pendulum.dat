40|$|We have {{investigated}} the turbulence transition of the superfluid 4 He flow generated by a <b>vibrating</b> <b>wire.</b> For a 1. 2 -kHz <b>vibrating</b> <b>wire,</b> we observed intermittent switchings between laminar and turbulent flows. The switching rate decreases with increasing temperature above 100 mK, until no occurrence of the switchings at 350 mK. For a 2. 4 -kHz <b>vibrating</b> <b>wire,</b> {{we find that the}} switching rate is much lower than that of the 1. 2 -kHz <b>vibrating</b> <b>wire</b> even at low temperatures. This result indicates that a mechanism causing the switchings is influenced by the temperature and the oscillation frequency of the superfluid flow. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{several authors}} {{described}} measurements of liquid viscosities higher than 100 mPa · s, using the <b>vibrating</b> <b>wire</b> technique in the forced oscillation mode of operation. The {{use of a}} <b>vibrating</b> <b>wire</b> instrument to measure increasingly higher viscosities poses experimental difficulties due to the consequent decrease of the quality factor of the resonance. This problem affects both modes of operation: in the steady-state, forced oscillation mode, there is a loss of definition of the resonance curve, and in the transient, free decay mode, there is an increase of the decrement of the sinusoidal time response of the <b>vibrating</b> <b>wire.</b> In the present work, we have measured the viscosity of diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP) at 0. 1 MPa with a <b>vibrating</b> <b>wire</b> of nominal radius of 190 μm using the free decay mode of operation. The measurements covered a range of viscosities from (64 to 265) mPa · s. The results agreed with those we have obtained with a <b>vibrating</b> <b>wire</b> instrument operated in the forced mode and with the literature data, within the estimated experimental uncertainty (k) 2) of (2 %.

To increase the heat deposition during the neutron scattering, use of gadolinium layer which has the highest thermal neutron capture cross section among all elements is proposed. The second type of the monitor uses <b>vibrating</b> <b>wire</b> as a resonant target. Besides the measurement of beam profile according to the average signal, the differential signal synchronized with the wire oscillations defines the gradient of beam profile.

40|$|This paper {{intends to}} be an {{approach}} on the <b>vibrating</b> <b>wire</b> transducer {{from the perspective of}} the necessary rules used for a correct measurement procedure. There are several studies which analyze the <b>vibrating</b> <b>wire</b> transducer as a mechanical system. However, a comparative time-domain analysis between the mechanical and the electrical model is lacking. The transducer analysis is based on a theoretical analysis of the equivalent circuit, on both excitation and response time intervals. The electrical model consists of two magnetic coupled resonating circuits. When connected to an excitation source, there will be an energy transfer from the coil to the wire. The maximum energy transfer will occur at the <b>vibrating</b> <b>wire's</b> frequency of resonance. Using the transient regime analysis, it has been proven that, in the response time interval - when the <b>wire</b> <b>vibrates</b> freely, the current through the circuit that models the wire describes the oscillating movement of the wire. A complex signal is obtained, that contains both coil's and wire's frequencies of resonance, strongly dependent with theirs parasitic elements.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the flow of {{superfluid}} 4 He generated by a <b>vibrating</b> <b>wire.</b> As the drive force increases, the velocity of the wire grows in the laminar-flow regime, until it suddenly drops {{at the onset of}} the turbulent-flow regime. As the drive force decreases, the turbulence disappears at a critical velocity. This result suggests that the vortices on the wire are confined within a finite size, even in turbulence. We have measured the critical velocity of seven <b>vibrating</b> <b>wires,</b> whose resonance frequencies range from 0. 5 kHz to 9 kHz, at 1. 4 K and found that the critical velocity is almost constant below an oscillation frequency of 2 kHz and increases above this frequency. We have also observed the response of a <b>vibrating</b> <b>wire</b> in superfluid 4 He at a low temperature of 30 mK. We find that the resonance frequency jumps upward at the same moment as the entry of the flow to a turbulent state. The frequency jump may be caused by vortex dynamics such as expansion, entanglement, and reconnection occurring in the turbulence. © 2006 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
