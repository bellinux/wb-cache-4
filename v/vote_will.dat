5|$|The {{applicant}} for {{an election}} {{to be avoided}} may ask for a declaration that the election is void, that a particular candidate was wrongfully declared to have been elected, and/or that another candidate was duly elected. The applicant may also request for a scrutiny– that is, a re-examination of the ballot papers– {{if he or she}} alleges that an unsuccessful candidate had a majority of lawful votes. When a scrutiny is conducted, the election judge may order a vote to be struck off if the voter was not on the register of electors assigned to the polling station at which the vote was recorded or was not authorized to vote at the station; if the vote was obtained by bribery, treating or undue influence; if the voter committed or induced someone to commit the offence of personation; and if the vote was for a disqualified candidate and the disqualification was either a matter that the voter was aware of or was sufficiently publicized or widely known. During a scrutiny, a tendered vote that is shown to be valid will be added to the poll if any party to the proceedings asks for the vote to be added. On the other hand, a registered elector's <b>vote</b> <b>will</b> not be struck off at a scrutiny just because he or she was not qualified to be on the electoral register, and the returning officer's decision {{as to whether or not}} a ballot paper should be rejected may not be questioned.|$|E

25|$|A local {{referendum}} {{was held}} on creating a parish council for unparished areas of Durham City in February and March 2017, in which 66% of voters supported the proposal. Following this, county councillors approved a formal consultation on the plans. A final <b>vote</b> <b>will</b> be taken by councillors in September 2017. If approved, the council would be created on 1 April 2018, with the first elections for parish councillors the following May.|$|E
25|$|A {{new member}} period may last {{anywhere}} from one weekend to several months. During this time new members might participate {{in almost all}} aspects {{of the life of the}} fraternity or sorority, but most likely not be permitted to hold office in the organization. At the conclusion of the new member period a second vote of members may sometimes be taken, often, but not always, using a blackball system. New members who pass this second <b>vote</b> <b>will</b> be invited to participate in a formal and secret ritual of initiation into the organization, advancing them to full membership.|$|E
25|$|Institutional {{factors have}} a {{significant}} impact on voter turnout. Rules and laws are also generally easier to change than attitudes, so much of the work done on how to improve voter turnout looks at these factors. Making voting compulsory has a direct and dramatic effect on turnout. Simply making it easier for candidates to stand through easier nomination rules is believed to increase voting. Conversely, adding barriers, such as a separate registration process, can suppress turnout. The salience of an election, the effect that a <b>vote</b> <b>will</b> have on policy, and its proportionality, how closely the result reflects the will of the people, are two structural factors that also likely have important effects on turnout.|$|E

25|$|A voter {{may also}} elect a party-list organization. The voter {{votes for the}} party, not for the candidate, and the voter is {{restricted}} to one vote. All votes are tallied in an at-large basis, and parties with at least 2% of the vote wins at least one seat in the House. A further two more seats will be granted if there are still spare seats (the party-list representatives comprise 20% of the House), {{and if there are}} still unfilled seats, the parties with less than 2% of the <b>vote</b> <b>will</b> get one seat each in descending order until all seats are filled. A party-list organization is limited to representing marginalized sectors of society such as youth, laborers, women, and the like.|$|E
25|$|Mark N. Franklin {{argues that}} salience, the {{perceived}} effect {{that an individual}} <b>vote</b> <b>will</b> have on how the country is run, has {{a significant effect on}} turnout. He presents Switzerland {{as an example of a}} nation with low salience. The nation's administration is highly decentralized, so that the federal government has limited powers. The government invariably consists of a coalition of parties, and the power wielded by a party is far more closely linked to its position relative to the coalition than to the number of votes it received. Important decisions are placed before the population in a referendum. Individual votes for the federal legislature are thus unlikely to have a significant effect on the nation, which probably explains the low average turnouts in that country. By contrast Malta, with one of the world's highest voter turnouts, has a single legislature that holds a near monopoly on political power. Malta has a two-party system in which a small swing in votes can completely alter the executive. On the other hand, countries with a two party system can experience low turnout if large numbers of potential voters perceive little real difference between the main parties. Voters' perceptions of fairness also have an important effect on salience. If voters feel that the result of an election is more likely to be determined by fraud and corruption than by the will of the people, fewer people will vote.|$|E

During a scrutiny, a tendered vote that is shown to be valid will be added to the poll if any party to the proceedings asks for the vote to be added.

The law does not allow the sale of marijuana; and city police still intend to enforce state law, under which possession is a civil offense, and only medical marijuana is legal. Supporters of marijuana legalization believe, [...] "this is just the next domino," [...] said Marijuana Policy Project Maine Political Director, David Boyer, [...] "I think there's national implications, keeping the momentum that Washington and Colorado started last November in ending marijuana prohibition."
