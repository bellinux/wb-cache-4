25|$|In {{attempting}} {{to address issues}} around the state reporting process, a number of undertakings have been attempted. One such example is of the World Conference on Human Rights in its <b>Vienna</b> <b>Declaration</b> and Programme of Action, which sought to implement a system whereby Human Rights officers are assigned to states, working at the regional level, {{for the purpose of}} disseminating information, training and aiding implementation on a technical level.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vienna</b> <b>Declaration</b> and Programme of Action urges at Section II para 47, {{all nations}} to {{undertake}} measures {{to the maximum}} extent of their available resources, {{with the support of}} international cooperation, to achieve the goals in the World Summit Plan of Action. And calls on States to integrate the Convention on the Rights of the Child into their national action plans. By means of these national action plans and through international efforts, particular priority should be placed on reducing infant and maternal mortality rates, reducing malnutrition and illiteracy rates and providing access to safe drinking water and basic education. Whenever so called for, national plans of action should be devised to combat devastating emergencies resulting from natural disasters and armed conflicts and the equally grave problem of children in extreme poverty. Further para 48 urges all states, with the support of international cooperation, to address the acute problem of children under especially difficult circumstances. Exploitation and abuse of children should be actively combated, including by addressing their root causes. Effective measures are required against female infanticide, harmful child labour, sale of children and organs, child prostitution, child pornography, as well as other forms of sexual abuse. This gave an influence to adoptions of Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.|$|E
500|$|An {{individual}} complaints mechanism {{was suggested}} during the original drafting of CEDAW, but was rejected at the time. [...] Fifteen years later, the <b>Vienna</b> <b>Declaration</b> and Programme of Action of the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights suggested that new procedures {{were needed to}} implement the Convention, and suggested a [...] "right of petition". An independent expert group produced a draft in 1994, containing a complaint procedure and an inquiry procedure, and this was adopted for further study by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in early 1995. The idea of an Optional Protocol was further endorsed by the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, which called for [...] "the elaboration (of) a draft optional protocol to the Women's Convention that could enter into force as soon as possible." ...|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Vienna</b> <b>Declaration</b> and Programme of Action, {{also known}} as VDPA, is a human rights {{declaration}} adopted by consensus at the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993 in Vienna, Austria.

2500|$|The Rome Statute Explanatory Memorandum, which {{defines the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the International Criminal Court, recognises rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, [...] "or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity" [...] as a crime against humanity if the action is part of a widespread or systematic practice.

2500|$|After waiting all day Wednesday (29 July) for a reply, Bethmann Hollweg [...] {{sent off}} three more telegrams {{urgently}} demanding an [...] "immediate" [...] answer to his ‘pledge plan’ {{and the plan}} for [...] "direct conversations" [...] between Austria and Russia and added in severe disapproval of Austria:"These expressions of the Austrian diplomats must be regarded as indications of more recent wishes and aspirations. I regard {{the attitude of the}} Austrian Government and its unparalleled procedure towards the various Governments with increasing astonishment. In St. Petersburg it declares its territorial disinterestedness; us it leaves wholly in the dark as to its programme; Rome it puts off with empty phrases about the question of compensation; in London, Count Mensdorff (the Austrian ambassador) hands out part of Serbia to Bulgaria and Albania and places himself in contradiction with <b>Vienna's</b> solemn <b>declaration</b> at St. Petersburg. From these contradictions I must conclude that the telegram disavowing Hoyos {who, on July 5/6 at Berlin, had spoken unofficially of Austria's partitioning of Serbia} was intended for the gallery, and that the Austrian Government is harboring plans which it sees fit to conceal from us, in order to assure itself in all events of German support and to avoid the refusal which might result from a frank statement." ...|$|R
5|$|Like Sweden, John II Casimir {{was also}} looking for allies to break the {{deadlock}} of the war. On 1 December 1656, he signed an alliance with Ferdinand III of Habsburg in <b>Vienna,</b> essentially a <b>declaration</b> of Ferdinand III's intend to mediate a peace rather than provide military aid, which did not come into effect until Ferdinand's death on 2 April 1657. The treaty was however renewed and amended on 27 May by Ferdinand's successor Leopold I of Habsburg, who agreed in Vienna to provide John II Casimir with 12,000 troops maintained at Polish expense; in return, Leopold received Kraków and Posen in pawn. Receiving the news, Frederick III of Denmark promptly declared war on Sweden, and by June the Austrian army entered the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the south, immediately stabilizing the situation in southern Poland, while Denmark attacked Swedish Bremen-Verden and turned to Jämtland and Västergötland in July.|$|R
2500|$|On June 17, 2011, South Africa led a {{resolution}} at the UNHRC requesting that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights draft a report [...] "documenting discriminatory laws and practices {{and acts of}} violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity" [...] to follow up {{and implementation of the}} <b>Vienna</b> <b>Declaration</b> and Programme of Action.

2500|$|Human rights {{organizations}} such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, used to focus primarily on documenting human rights violations on the civil and political level. No longer do these organizations focus solely on human rights violations, but also on social, economic, and cultural rights. [...] The evolution of human {{rights organizations}} and development organizations and the western idea that rights are asserted through responsibilities, duties, transparency, trust, and accountability {{have led to the}} development of the rights-based approach. In 1993 the UN held the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna; during this conference they developed the <b>Vienna</b> <b>Declaration</b> and Programme of Action, where they linked democracy, human rights, sustainability and development. [...] This made the Cold War division of Civil and Political Rights and Economic Social and Cultural rights interdependent. This further led to the linkage between human rights and development and enabled policy makers and developers to incorporate a rights-based approach into their policies.|$|E
