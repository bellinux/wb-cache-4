40|$|ABSTRACT: Symptoms of {{intravascular}} volume overload {{and increased}} cardiac filling pressures in the systemic and pulmonary <b>venous</b> <b>circulations</b> {{are among the}} most com-mon complaints in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). The clinical utility of physical examination for esti-mation of intravascular volume status in patients with CHF is limited due to poor specificity and sensitivity of most signs of congestion. Direct measurement of blood volume with radioisotope techniques is FDA-approved and {{has been shown to be}} closely associated with invasive mea-surements of cardiac filling pressures in patients with CHF. Unrecognized volume overload is common in CHF patients and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

40|$|The {{hallmark}} {{manifestations of}} Cushing’s syndrome (CS) are well known, but hypercoagulability is perhaps least recognized. Patients with CS are {{at increased risk}} of both spontaneous and postoperative thromboembolism, with the significant majority of events occurring in the lower extremity and pulmonary <b>venous</b> <b>circulations.</b> We present a case of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) occurring in the setting of newly diagnosed CS due to a left adrenal adenoma. Factor VIII activity was approximately 2. 5 -fold elevated, a known mechanism by which hypercortisolemia predisposes to venous thrombosis. Acute abdominal pain and fever responded well to unfractionated heparin and parenteral antibiotics, and CS was eventually cured by left adrenalectomy. No thromboembolic events have occurred since surgery. PVT is uncommon and usually occurs as a complication of primary or secondary hepatobiliary malignancies and cirrhosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is just the second reported case of PVT due to CS and the first published in the English language literature...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1980 s, {{attempts}} at experimental fetal cardiac bypass {{for the purpose}} of correcting severe congenital heart defects in the womb have been hampered by deterioration of placental function. This placental pathophysiology in turn affects transplacental transport of nutrients and gas exchange. To date, the effects of bypass on fetal metabolism and oxygen delivery have not been studied. Nine Suffolk sheep fetuses from 109 - 121 days gestation were instrumented and placed on fetal bypass for 30 minutes and followed post-bypass for 2 hours.

40|$|Abstract Physical {{activity}} {{can raise the}} level of circulating HDL cholesterol. Pre� 1 -HDL is thought to be either the initial acceptor of cellular cholesterol or virtually the first particle in the pathway of the formation of HDL from apolipoprotein A-I and cellular lipids. We have therefore sought to identify pre� 1 -HDL in arterial and <b>venous</b> <b>circulations</b> of exercising legs in healthy individuals and in subjects with stable Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Blood samples were taken simultaneously from the femoral artery and vein before and after 25 min cycling exercise. The major findings were, first, that exercise significantly increased plasma concentration of pre� 1 -HDL (20 % increase, P � 0. 05) and second, that the pre� 1 -HDL concentration was significantly higher in the venous compared with the arterial blood both before and after exercise in both diabetics and controls. In the combined population, formation of pre� 1 -HDL at rest was 9. 9 � 5. 2 mg/min and exercise enhanced pre� 1 -HDL formation 6. 6 -fold in both groups. —Sviridov, D., B. Kingwell, A. Hoang, A.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine whether reflex cardiovascular responses were obtained to localised distension of the intrapulmonary arterial and <b>venous</b> <b>circulations</b> in a preparation in which the stimuli to other major reflexogenic areas were controlled and the lung was shown to possess reflex activity. Dogs were anaesthetised with [alpha]-chloralose, artificially ventilated, the chests widely opened and a cardiopulmonary bypass established. The intrapulmonary region of the left lung was isolated and perfused through the left pulmonary artery and drained through cannulae in the left pulmonary veins via a Starling resistance. Intrapulmonary arterial and venous pressures were controlled by the rate of inflow of blood and the pressure applied to the Starling resistance. Pressures to the carotid, aortic and coronary baroreceptors and heart chambers were controlled. Responses of vascular resistance were assessed from changes in perfusion pressures to a vascularly isolated hind limb and to the remainder of the subdiaphragmatic circulation (flows constant). The reactivity of the preparation was demonstrated by observing decreases in vascular resistance to large step changes in carotid sinus pressure (systemic vascular resistance decreased by - 40 ± 5...|$|R

40|$|The {{one-dimensional}} {{model of}} Olufsen (2000) [*] for blood {{flow in the}} systemic arteries has been extended and built upon {{in a number of}} ways. Firstly, it has been applied to hypotheses of diseases of the systemic circulation, and that of the microcirculation. With a view to better understanding the microcirculation (the smallest vessels of the systemic circulation) and its diseases, the model has been extended to provide predictions of the propagating pressure pulse and flow rate in small arteries. Secondly, Olufsen’s model {{has been used as a}} base upon which to build a model of the pulmonary circulation, incorporating both the pulmonary arterial and <b>venous</b> <b>circulations,</b> with detailed simulations of pressure and flow predicted in the large pulmonary arteries and large pulmonary veins. To this end, a new model has been eveloped to describe a connected network of small arteries and small veins, replacing the small arterial model used as an outflow condition in the original model. A new outflow condition to describe the return of blood from the pulmonary venous system to the left atrium of the heart has also been implemented. Finally, this new pulmonary model has been applied to various hypotheses as to the causes of diseases and disorders of the pulmonary circulation, providing predictions of pressure and flow in the large pulmonary arteries and veins in both normal and abnormal circumstances, and showing agreement with clinical observations.

The standard approach in parameter calibration for computer codes is to emulate the simulator using a Gaussian Process (GP) prior. In the present work, we take a different approach and emulate the objective function itself, i. e. the residual sum of squares between the simulations and the observed data.

30|$|Short-term hyperoxia after {{cardiac surgery}} induces {{significant}} alterations in systemic circulation mainly by vasoconstriction {{of both the}} <b>venous</b> and arterial <b>circulation</b> and an increase of mean systemic filling pressure. The increase in stressed volume and systemic filling pressure by hyperoxia resembles the effects of administering a fluid bolus or norepinephrine.

50|$|In {{the short}} term, {{children}} can {{have trouble with}} pleural effusions (fluid building up around the lungs).

40|$|Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is character-ized by {{structural}} remodeling of postcapillary venules {{and small}} veins in the lung, resulting in intimal thickening, fibrosis, luminal occlusion, and thrombosis.

There was no association between age or gender and dominance. Right parasagittal division of the superior sagittal sinus was associated with right dominance of the transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein; and left parasagittal division of the superior sagittal sinus was associated with left dominance of the transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein. Conclusion A dominance pattern of cranial venous sinuses was found. Age and gender did not influence this pattern.
