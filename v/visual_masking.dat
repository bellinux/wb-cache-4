The image content is analyzed and properties of HVS are exploited {{to generate a}} <b>visual</b> <b>mask</b> {{of the same size}} as the approximation image. Using this mask we embed the watermark in the approximation image without degrading the image quality. Watermark detection is performed without using the original image. Experimental results show that the proposed watermarking method is robust against most common image processing operations, which can be easily implemented and usually do not degrade the image quality.

40|$|The {{present study}} showed {{that there are two}} {{distinctive}} processes underlying oculomotor capture by abrupt onset. When a <b>visual</b> <b>mask</b> between the cue and the target eliminates the unique luminance transient of an onset, the onset still attracts attention in a top-down fashion. This memory-based prioritization of onset is voluntarily controlled by the knowledge of target location. But when there is no <b>visual</b> <b>mask</b> between the cue and the target, the onset captures attention mainly in a bottom-up manner. This transient-driven capture of onset is involuntary because it occurs even when the onset is completely irrelevant to the target location. In addition, the present study demonstrated distinctive temporal characteristics for these two processes. The involuntary capture driven by luminance transients is rapid and brief, whereas the memory-based voluntary prioritization of onset is more sluggish and long-lived...|$|R
40|$|The {{necessary}} condition for sensory information to enter consciousness remains an open question. Studies on humans and non-human primates indicate the need for reverberant neural activity lasting for 10 s- 100 s of milliseconds. Properties of this reverberant activity, especially the involvement of early sensory areas, are heavily debated. Here, we addressed these issues using behavior and causal circuit manipulation in mice. Using <b>visual</b> backward <b>masking,</b> we first tested whether visual perception in mice requires reverberant neural activity. Mice were trained to discriminate between locations (± 45 deg eccentricity) of a briefly presented target (grating, 16 ms duration, 10 contrast). After reaching threshold discriminability (d’ > 2), bilateral masks (plaids, 16 ms, 100 contrast) were introduced at various delays to target onset. Mice performed at chance up to stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 66. 7 ms. Together {{with the results of}} rats (Watanabe et al. SfN 2014), the capacity of the mask to render the target invisible beyond the time of target offset indicates the necessity of reverberant activity for rodent visual perception. Next, to investigate whether V 1 takes part in the crucial circuitry for perception, we replaced the <b>visual</b> <b>mask</b> with optogenetic suppression of V 1. Unlike the <b>visual</b> <b>mask</b> eliciting activity throughout the visual system, optogenetic suppression acts locally and is ideal for testing the necessity of activity in distinct processing stages. We trained mice with ChR 2 expression targeted at V 1 PV+ inhibitory interneurons in the position discrimination task, in which we replaced the <b>visual</b> <b>mask</b> by bilateral optogenetic suppression of V 1 activity. We induced suppression by activation of inhibitory interneurons (1. 5 s duration) at various delays. Behavioral performance was at chance when V 1 was suppressed before the onset of target evoked activity, but was significantly above chance when suppressed later (> 32 ms). Since only the initial transient V 1 response, and not the later sustained V 1 activity, is required for perception, V 1 seems to function as an initial supplier of visual information to the reverberant loop, but does not {{play a crucial role in}} its maintenance. Finally we investigated <b>visual</b> forward <b>masking</b> where a <b>visual</b> <b>mask</b> (16 ms, 100 contrast) precedes the target (16 ms, 10 contrast). Behavioral results showed extended SOA ranges of invisibility (16 - 150 ms). Interestingly, neural responses to high contrast masks (16 ms duration) resulted in a prolonged neural suppression effect (150 ms) that matched the SOAs of invisibility. The results indicate that forward masking blocks relaying of visual information as early as area V 1...|$|R
50|$|Binocular switch {{suppression}} (BSS) is {{a fairly}} new technique developed to suppress usually salient images from one's awareness. Unlike previous methods such as <b>visual</b> <b>masking,</b> this new empirical method allows one to investigate the neural and behavioural consequences {{during the period of}} visual suppression itself and not just after the presentation of the target stimuli. Suppressing usually salient images from an individual's awareness is regarded as a popular experimental manipulation in visual perception and cognitive neuroscience. Some popular and familiar examples of such manipulation include binocular rivalry, continuous flash suppression (CFS), <b>visual</b> <b>masking</b> and flicker switch suppression.|$|E

40|$|How {{the brain}} {{represents}} visual space is an unsolved mystery. Spatial localization becomes particularly challenging when visual information processing is briefly disrupted, {{as in the}} case of saccadic eye movements, blinks, or <b>visual</b> <b>masks.</b> As we have recently reported, a compression of visual space, illustrated by displacements of shortly flashed stimuli, can be observed in the temporal vicinity of masking stimuli during ocular fixation (Zimmermann et al., 2013). We here aimed at investigating the neural mechanisms underlying these displacements using functional magnetic resonance imaging. On the behavioral level, we detected significant stimulus displacement when <b>visual</b> <b>masks</b> were simultaneously presented. At the neural level, we observed decreased human motion complex V 5 /MT+ activation associated with these displacements: When comparing trials with a perceived stimulus shift in space to trials of veridical perception of stimulus localization, human V 5 /MT+ was significantly less activated although no differences in perceived motion can account for this. Data suggest an important role of human V 5 /MT+ in the process of spatial localization of briefly presented objects and thus extend current concepts of the functions of human V 5 /MT+...|$|R
40|$|Multisensory {{integration}} provides {{continuous and}} stable perception from separate sensory inputs. Here, we investigated the functional role of temporal binding between {{the visual and}} the tactile senses. To this end we used the paradigm of compression that induces shifts in time when probe stimuli are degraded, e. g., by a <b>visual</b> <b>mask</b> (Zimmermann et al. 2014). Subjects had to estimate the duration of temporal intervals of 500 [*]ms defined by a tactile and a <b>visual,</b> <b>masked</b> stimulus. We observed a strong (~ 100 [*]ms) underestimation of the temporal interval when the stimuli from both senses appeared to occur at the same position in space. In contrast, when {{the positions of the}} visual and tactile stimuli were spatially separate, interval perception was almost veridical. Temporal compression furthermore depended on the correspondence of probe features and was absent when the orientation of the tactile and visual probes was incongruent. An additional experiment revealed that temporal compression also occurs when objects were presented outside the attentional focus. In conclusion, these data support a role for spatiotemporal binding in temporal compression, which is at least in part selective for object features...|$|R
50|$|There are {{multiple}} theories surrounding the neural correlates of masking, {{but most of}} them agree on a few key ideas. First, backward <b>visual</b> <b>masking</b> comes about from suppression of the target’s “after-discharge”, where the after-discharge {{can be thought of as}} the neural response to the target’s termination. Forward masking, on the other hand, is correlated to the suppression of the target’s “onset-response”, which can be thought of as the neural response to the target’s appearance.|$|E

5000|$|This was {{proposed}} by Thompson and Schall, based on experiments conducted in 1999 and 2000. [...] They concluded that <b>visual</b> <b>masking</b> is processed in the frontal-eye fields, {{and that the}} neural correlate of masking lies not in the inhibition of {{the response to the}} target but in the “merging” of target and mask responses. One criticism of their experiment, however, is that their target was almost 300x dimmer than the mask, so their results may have been confounded by the different response latencies one would expect from stimuli with such differences in brightness.|$|E

50|$|Inattentional {{blindness}} {{is related}} to but distinct from other failures of visual awareness such as change blindness, repetition blindness, <b>visual</b> <b>masking,</b> and attentional blink. The key aspect of inattentional blindess which makes it distinct from other failures in awareness rests {{on the fact that}} the undetected stimulus is unexpected. It is the unexpected nature of said stimulus that differentiates inattentional blindness from failures of awareness such as attentional failures like the aforementioned attentional blink. It is critical to acknowledge that occurrences of inattentional blindness are attributed to the failure to consciously attend to an item in the visual field as opposed the absence of cognitive processing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Visual</b> <b>masking</b> {{occurs when}} the {{perception}} of one stimulus, called a target, {{is affected by the}} presence of another stimulus, called a mask. With respect to time, there are three different types of masking - forward, backward, and simultaneous.

In the spatial domain, there are two different types of masking: pattern masking and metacontrast. Pattern masking {{occurs when the}} target and mask are presented within the same retinal location, and metacontrast occurs when the mask does not overlap with the target location.|$|E

40|$|Change {{blindness}} {{studies have}} revealed people's inability to detect changes between two consecutively presented scenes {{when they are}} separated by a distractor. This failure has been reported within vision, audition, and touch but also crossmodally. In particular, participants' performance in detecting changes in position between two tactile scenes is impaired not only when a tactile mask is introduced between the two to-be-compared displays but also when a <b>visual</b> <b>mask</b> is used instead. Interestingly, with similar procedure, there is no effect of auditory masks on a tactile task or of tactile <b>masks</b> on a <b>visual</b> task (Auvray et al., 2007, 2008; Gallace et al., 2006). Such crossmodal change blindness effect also occurs when participants perform a different task.

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} change {{detection}} {{have revealed that}} people are surprisingly poor at detecting changes between two consecutively-presented scenes, when they are separated by a distractor that masks the transients typically associated with change. This failure, known as change blindness, has been reported within vision, audition, and touch.

50|$|Laboratory {{research}} on unconscious perception often employs simple stimuli (e.g., geometric shapes or colors) in which visibility {{is controlled by}} <b>visual</b> <b>masking.</b> Masked stimuli are then used to prime the processing of subsequently presented target stimuli. For instance, in the Response Priming paradigm, participants have {{to respond to a}} target stimulus (e.g., by identifying whether it is a diamond or a square) which is immediately preceded by a masked priming stimulus (also a diamond or a square). The prime has large effects on responses to the target; it speeds responses when it is consistent with the target, and slows responses when it is inconsistent. Response priming effects can be dissociated from visual awareness of the prime, such as when prime identification performance is at chance, or when priming effects increase despite decreases in prime visibility.|$|E
50|$|Macknick & Martinez-Conde {{recorded}} from neurons in {{the lateral}} geniculate nucleus (LGN) and V1 V1 while presenting monoptic and dichoptic stimuli, and found that monoptic masking occurred in all the LGN and V1 neurons that were recorded, but dichoptic masking only occurred {{in some of the}} binocular neurons in V1, which supports the hypothesis that <b>visual</b> <b>masking</b> in monoptic regions is not due to feedback from dichoptic regions. This is because, if there had been feedback from higher areas of the visual field, the early circuits would have “inherited” dichoptic masking from the feedback coming from higher levels, and so would exhibit both dichoptic and monoptic masking. Although monoptic masking is stronger in the early visual areas, monoptic and dichoptic masking are equivalent in magnitude. Thus, dichoptic masking must become stronger as it proceeds down the visual hierarchy if the preceding hypothesis is correct. In fact, dichoptic masking was shown to begin downstream of area V2.|$|E
50|$|Experiments {{show that}} the time-course of the {{response}} priming effect (increasing effects with increasing SOA) is independent of the degree and time-course of masking. Klotz and Neumann (1999) demonstrated response priming effects under complete masking of the prime. Extending these findings to other time-courses of <b>visual</b> <b>masking,</b> Vorberg et al. varied the time-course of masking by controlling the relative duration of primes and targets. In their experiments, targets were arrows pointing left or right, while primes were smaller arrows metacontrast-masked by the targets. When participants tried to identify the pointing direction of the primes, any of the time-courses depicted in Fig. 3 could be produced depending on stimulus conditions: complete visibility, complete masking, type-A masking, and type-B masking. However, when participants had to respond {{as quickly as possible}} to the direction of the target, priming effects in all those conditions were virtually identical. Moreover, the time-course of priming was always the same (increasing priming effect with increasing SOA), no matter whether the primes were visible or invisible and no matter whether visibility increased or decreased with SOA.|$|E

Visual presentations of letters served as targets or visual prepulses in an intermixed session of backward masking and PPI. Backward masking and PPI (both auditory and visual) were assessed at stimulus onset asynchronies of 30, 45, 60, 120, and 150 ms. A repeated-measures regression revealed that there was {{a relationship between}} backward masking and PPI for both visual and auditory PPI, with higher levels of PPI being associated with greater recovery from backward masking.

50|$|The {{theory of}} direct {{parameter}} specification (Fig. 4) was proposed by Odmar Neumann at the University of Bielefeld, Germany, {{to explain the}} Fehrer-Raab effect {{as well as the}} results of early response priming studies. The theory assumes that at the outset of a response priming experiment, participants acquire rules of stimulus-response assignment, which quickly become automatized. Following this practice phase, the motor response can be prepared so far that only a single critical stimulus feature (e.g., diamond vs. square) is still needed to specify the response. This incoming stimulus feature then defines the last missing action parameter (e.g., left vs. right keypress). Responses are elicited quickly and directly, without the need for a conscious representation of the eliciting stimulus. Response priming is explained by assuming that the prime's features elicit exactly the same parameter specification processes that are supposed to be elicited by the target stimulus. In parallel to the response elicitation process, a conscious representation of primes and targets emerges, which can be subject to <b>visual</b> <b>masking</b> processes. However, the conscious representation of the stimuli doesn't play any role for the motor processes in the current experimental trial.|$|E
5000|$|In Fig. 3, some typical time-courses of <b>visual</b> <b>masking</b> {{effects are}} shown as a {{function}} of the prime-target SOA, in a response-priming experiment where the target itself serves as a masking stimulus (Fig. 1a, c). Here, the measure of prime visibility could be the discrimination performance of a participant trying to guess the shape of the prime (diamond or square) in each trial. Without masking, performance would be nearly perfect; the participant would have little difficulty classifying the prime correctly as a square or a diamond in every trial. In contrast, if masking was complete, discrimination performance would be at chance level (Fig. 3, left panel). In many experiments, however, the time-course of masking is less extreme (Fig. 3, right panel). Most stimulus conditions lead to so-called [...] "type-A masking", where the degree of masking is highest at short SOAs and then diminishes, so that the prime becomes easier to discriminate for increasing SOAs. Under some circumstances, however, [...] "type-B masking" [...] can be obtained, where the degree of masking is highest at intermediate SOAs but where the prime becomes easier to discriminate at shorter or longer SOAs. Type-B masking can occur with metacontrast masking but critically depends on stimulus properties of primes and targets. In addition, the time-course of masking can vary greatly from person to person.|$|E
