30|$|Part of {{our present}} {{knowledge}} about electron beam damage on plastic sections derives from studies relying on tracking fiducial markers [8]. It therefore {{comes as no surprise}} that the same information is inherently contained in any EMT process whose <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> shares the same principles. In fact, the overall quality of a reconstruction technique depends on how well the <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> compensates for sample deformation, among other issues.|$|R
40|$|Beam {{deviation}} in the polarizing elements {{is identified}} as {{a significant source of}} error in existing ellipsometer <b>alignment</b> <b>procedures.</b> A high precision <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> that eliminates these errors is described. This procedure is less time consuming than previous methods, and its accuracy is comparable to the limit of resolution of the ellipsometer (typically 0. 01 - 0. 005 °). A further advantage of this procedure is that it provides a precise method for the alignment of specimens and lasers with the ellipsometer. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> is an {{important}} step in the process chain of the assembly of micro-optical components and has a direct impact on the system performance of the micro-optical system, the necessary assembly time and the manufacturing costs. For these reasons, only <b>alignment</b> <b>procedures</b> that are adapted to the special requirements of each assembly task will be able to save costs and attain the best optical system performance. The paper describes the alignment methods and illustrates the assembly procedures based on selected micro-optical examples...|$|R
40|$|The {{positions}} of the silicon modules of the CMS tracker will be known to O(100 μm) from survey measurements, mounting precision and the hardware alignment system. However, in order to fully exploit {{the capabilities of the}} tracker, these positions need to be known to a precision of a few μm. Only a track-based <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> can reach this required precision. Such an <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> is a major challenge given that about 50. 000 geometry constants need to be measured. Making use of the novel χ^ 2 minimization program Millepede II an alignment strategy has been developed in which all detector components are aligned simultaneously and all correlations between their position parameters taken into account. Tracks from different sources such as Z^ 0 decays and cosmic ray muons, plus information about the mechanical structure of the tracker, and initial position uncertainties have been used as input for the <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure.</b> A proof of concept of this alignment strategy is demonstrated using simulated data...|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{implementation}} of the complex wavefront modulation model in practical optical <b>alignment</b> <b>procedures</b> and present its interim results. This modulation model describes the relation between the alignment state and the wavefront of a system, both are expressed in mathematical complex quantities. It addresses the importance of the coupled inter-element alignment effect to the resultant system wavefront. We utilise this effect in order to extract the alignment state of a system from measured optical wavefronts. We demonstrate the method's practical applicability to the real optical <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> by showing <b>alignment</b> simulations of a centered three-mirror system...|$|R

40|$|A new {{procedure}} to align {{single nucleotide polymorphism}} (SNP) microarray signals for copy number analysis is proposed. For each individual array, this reference <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> (RAP) uses a set of selected markers as internal references to direct the signal alignment. RAP aligns the signals so that each array has a similar signal distribution among its reference markers. An accompanying reference selection algorithm (RSA) uses genotype calls and initial signal intensities to choose two-copy markers as the internal references for each array. After RSA and RAP are applied, each array has a similar distribution of signals of two-copy markers so that across-array signal comparisons are biologically meaningful. An upper bound for a statistical metric of signal misalignment is derived and provides a theoretical basis to choose RSA-RAP over other <b>alignment</b> <b>procedures</b> for copy number analysis of cancers. In our study of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, RSA-RAP gives copy number analysis results that show substantially better concordance with cytogenetics than do two other <b>alignment</b> <b>procedures.</b> Availability: Documented R code is freely available from www. stjuderesearch. org/depts/biostats/refnorm.

40|$|The plasma-beam <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> earlier {{developed}} for the alignment of nematic liquid crystals is successfully extended to ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLC). The highly uniform alignment of the “chevron” structure (before electrical treatment of FLC cells) and “quasi bookshelf” structure (after the electrical treatment) are realized. The contrast of bistable switching larger than 350 : 1 is achieved. This makes the non-contact plasma-beam <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> especially attractive for high-contrast bistable LCDs on an LCOS base, particularly used in PDA and e-books. Fast switching and realization of gray scale in the plasma-beam aligned FLC cellsmakes this technique also promising for full-color displays including color LCD TV...|$|R

30|$|For the {{structure}} space, an existing tree edit distance is used that is obtained through a sequence <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> and the minimization {{of the cost}} for transforming one tree into the other, allowing deletions, insertions and relabeling of nodes as edit operations [54]. Similarly, the distance measure for the transition states starts with an <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure.</b> This can either {{be done on the}} graph representation or a unique string form of the transition state [65]. Edit operations include substitution of atoms, rearrangement of electron re-ordering, substitution of bonds and increase/decrease of transition state size. The cost of the edit operations rises in this order, atom substitution thus being the cheapest operation. The total cost for transforming one transition state to the other is then minimized.|$|R
40|$|We {{show how}} a basic {{pairwise}} <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure</b> {{can be improved}} to more accurately align conserved structural regions, by using variable, position-dependent gap penalties that depend on secondary structure and by taking the consensus {{of a number of}} suboptimal alignments. These improvements, which are novel for structural alignment, are direct analogs of what is possible with normal sequence alignment. They are feasible for us since our basic structural <b>alignment</b> <b>procedure,</b> unlike others, is so similar to normal sequence alignment. We further present preliminary results that show how our procedure can be generalized to produce a multiple alignment of a family of structures. Our approach is based on finding a "median " structure from doing all possible pairwise alignments and then aligning everything to it...|$|R

40|$|National audienceQuantitative {{measurements}} of restoration quality in blind deconvolution are {{complicated by the}} necessity to compensate for opposite shifts of reconstructed image and point-spread function. <b>Alignment</b> <b>procedures</b> mentioned for this purpose in the literature are sometimes not exactly enough specified; alignment-free approaches sometimes do {{not take into account}} the full variability of possible shifts. We investigate by experiments on a simple test case the errors induced by interpolation-based <b>alignment</b> <b>procedures.</b> We propose a new method for MSE/PSNR measurement of image pairs involving non-integer displacements that is based on a superresolution approach. We introduce an innocence assumption in order to keep deviations that can be explained by shifted sampling grids out of the error measurement. In our test case, the new measurement procedure reduces the variations in MSE/PSNR measurements substantially, creating the hope that it can be used for valid comparisons of blind deconvolution methods...|$|R
