5|$|In 1876, Wallace {{needed a}} £500 advance from the {{publisher}} of The Geographical Distribution of Animals {{to avoid having to}} sell some of his personal property. Darwin was <b>very</b> <b>aware</b> of Wallace's financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get Wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science. When the £200 annual pension was awarded in 1881, it helped to stabilise Wallace's financial position by supplementing the income from his writings.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{return to}} Versailles, Eliza joins Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate at her estate before the {{invasion}} of the Palatinate in her name. Eliza informs William of Orange of the troop movements caused by the French invasion which frees his forces along the border of the Spanish Netherlands, a region of stalemate between France and the Dutch Republic. During her flight from the Electorate of the Palatinate, Eliza becomes pregnant by Louis's cryptographer, though popular knowledge suggested it was the French nobleman Etienne D'Arcachon's child. Meanwhile, William takes the free troops from the border on the Spanish Netherlands to England, precipitating the Glorious Revolution, including the expulsion of JamesII. James flees London and Daniel Waterhouse soon encounters him in a bar. Convinced that the Stuart monarchy has collapsed, Daniel returns to London and takes revenge on Jeffreys by inciting a crowd to capture him for trial and later execution. Though he plans to depart for Massachusetts, Daniel's case of bladder stones increasingly worsens during this period. The Royal Society and other family friends are <b>very</b> <b>aware</b> of this and force Daniel to get the stone removed by Robert Hooke at Bedlam.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 80´s Kjell Eng, {{the founder of}} Engtex, got the idea to use {{textiles}} for protection and cut prevention. Having worked as a logger earlier in life, he was <b>very</b> <b>aware</b> of the danger in using and handling a chainsaw. The first generation of protective fabrics consisted of a multi-layered and specially designed tricot fabric that peeled off layer by layer at contact with the cutting chains. This was the start and the first-ever chainsaw protective fabric was born. Statistics showed a reduction in injuries at work-related accidents in forestry and logging. However the new fabrics did not stop the more severe accidents with deep cuts and lethal outcome.|$|E
25|$|Humans are {{the primary}} predators on markhor. Because markhor inhabit very steep and {{inaccessible}} mountainous habitat, several strongholds of markhor populations have been rarely approached by man. Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) have been reported preying upon young markhor. Among wild carnivores, Himalayan lynx (Felis lynx), leopard cats (Felis bengalensis), snow leopards (Panthera uncia), wolves (Canis lupus), and black bears (Ursus thibetanus) are the main predators of markhor. Because of these threats, the markhor possess keen eyesight and {{a strong sense of}} smell to detect nearby predators. Markhor are <b>very</b> <b>aware</b> of their surroundings and are on high alert for predators. In exposed areas, they are quick to spot and flee from predators.|$|E

25|$|Both Art and Horace were very, <b>very</b> <b>aware</b> of {{what they}} wanted to do. They wanted {{to get away from the}} jazz scene of the early '50s, which was the Birdland scene—you hire Phil Woods or Charlie Parker or J. J. Johnson, they come and sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that everybody knows. There's no rehearsal, there's no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew that the only way to get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to really make music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and keep everything short. They really liked digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E
25|$|The Hutu {{militants in}} the camps were <b>very</b> <b>aware</b> that the camps {{provided}} both protection and resources for their military activities. They thus {{had an interest in}} keeping the camps where they were, in effect making the refugees semi-hostages. Rumors of Tutsi retributions and an impending second genocide also convinced many Hutu refugees that they should not return. The obvious candidate to impose order was the Zairean government of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. However, Zaire was a large and weak state, which did not have firm control of the eastern regions that were {{on the opposite side of}} the country from the capital. It has also been noted that Uganda and Zaire had unfriendly relations. Mobutu would not have been pleased by the emergence of a Rwandan government that was allied with Uganda and may have hoped that the Hutu militants could rid him of the new government of Paul Kagame. Documents belonging to Hutu fighters show that Mobutu allowed the militants to ship large amounts of arms into the country. The only other option with international credibility was a multilateral intervention led by the UN, but it quickly became clear that few nations were interested in what seemed certain to be a difficult and bloody operation in a remote African region.|$|E

According to Paul's brother Mike, McCartney's father was also disapproving, declaring that Lennon would get his son [...] "into trouble", {{although}} he later allowed the fledgling band to rehearse in the McCartneys' front room at 20Forthlin Road.

[...] "Unjustly taking and keeping the property of others" [...] considered as theft, even if the act is {{outside the scope of}} civil law. Cardinal Christoph Schönborn gave example from the story of Saint Augustine, written in his Confessions, who took pears from neighbor's garden when he was young. Schönborn says that Augustine still has [...] "pangs of conscience over a childish theft" [...] even when he became grown person, indicating that human conscience is <b>very</b> <b>aware</b> of theft though the act perhaps not an offense against civil law.|$|E

Karl Bartos wrote that about these rules, stating that [...] "it's not easy to turn knobs on a synthesizer if you are drunk or full of drugs. ...

500|$|In early February {{the marquis}} arrived back unannounced {{at his house}} in Rio de Janeiro, much to the {{surprise}} of his wife. The Viscount of Inhaúma also returned home shortly afterwards, but with his health so compromised that he died a few weeks later. Upon learning of Inhaúma's death, Caxias said: [...] "and the same would have had happened to me, had I not resolved {{to get out of that}} hell." [...] PedroII was greatly disappointed in Caxias, but he was also <b>very</b> <b>aware</b> that the marquis was the person most responsible for the great successes during the war, accomplishments that had come at the cost of years of sacrifice and personal bravery.

500|$|... "Brawl in the Family" [...] {{features}} British {{actor and}} theater director Delroy Lindo as Gabriel, the social worker. According to Jean, Lindo {{was chosen to}} guest star because of his [...] "great voice." [...] Gabriel was then designed to match Lindo's voice. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Lindo expressed dissatisfaction with the character's design. He said [...] "Were I an audience member, looking at this [...] I'd think, 'That guy doesn't sound like he looks.'" [...] However, he added that his appearance in the episode earned him [...] "much cred" [...] among his nieces and nephews. In an interview with The A.V.

500|$|Hawes {{suggests}} that Kafka, though <b>very</b> <b>aware</b> {{of his own}} Jewishness, did not incorporate it into his work, which, according to Hawes, lacks Jewish characters, scenes or themes. In the opinion of literary critic Harold Bloom, although Kafka was uneasy with his Jewish heritage, he was the quintessential Jewish writer. Lothar Kahn is likewise unequivocal: [...] "The presence of Jewishness in Kafka's [...] is no longer subject to doubt". Pavel Eisner, one of Kafka's first translators, interprets [...] (The Trial) {{as the embodiment of}} the [...] "triple dimension of Jewish existence in Prague... his protagonist Josef K. is (symbolically) arrested by a German (Rabensteiner), a Czech (Kullich), and a Jew (Kaminer).

[...] In February 1963 Stroud met and talked with actor Burt Lancaster, who portrayed him in The Birdman of Alcatraz. Stroud never got to see the film or read the book it was based on but did share on {{one of the problems that}} prevented parole, that he was an [...] "admitted homosexual."
