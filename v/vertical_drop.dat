5|$|According to Walter Bolliger, {{development}} of the Dive Coaster began between 1994 and 1995. On March 14, 1998, the world's first Dive Coaster, Oblivion, opened at Alton Towers. Though Oblivion is classified as a Dive Coaster, {{it does not have}} a true <b>vertical</b> <b>drop</b> as the drop angle is 87-degrees. Two years later, the second Dive Coaster built, Diving Machine G5, opened at Janfusun Fancyworld and also does not have a <b>vertical</b> <b>drop.</b> In 2005, SheiKra opened at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and was the first Dive Coaster to feature a 90-degree drop and a splashdown element. In 2007, Busch Gardens Williamsburg announced that Griffon would be the first ever Dive Coaster to feature floorless trains and SheiKra would have its trains replaced with floorless ones. In 2011, the first 'mini' Dive Coaster opened at Heide Park Resort, named Krake. Unlike other Dive Coasters, Krake has smaller trains consisting of three rows of six riders.|$|E
5|$|The Dive Coaster is a steel {{roller coaster}} {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where riders experience {{a moment of}} free-falling {{with at least one}} near 90-degree drop. Unlike other roller coasters where the lift hill takes the train directly to the first drop, a Dive Coaster lift hill leads to a flat section of track followed by a holding brake which stops the train just as it enters the <b>vertical</b> <b>drop.</b> After a few seconds, the train is released into the drop.|$|E

50|$|Sylvan Hills is {{a county}} park within the Wausau city limits. During the winter, tubing {{takes place on}} hills that have <b>vertical</b> <b>drops</b> of up to 133 ft.|$|R
5|$|Located at {{the highest}} point of the Municipality lies El Volcan, a small {{mountain}} of about 1500 meters from sea level. This mountain has a Downhill course that has about 500 meters of <b>vertical</b> <b>drop,</b> it is used by hundreds of riders a day during dry and wet weather, mostly on weekends. The course {{is open to the}} public and riding is neither specifically allowed nor prohibited by law. The trails are also used by hikers all week long. Shuttles are about 10 Venezuelan bolivars per trip, they run from the parking lot of a Farmatodo drug store in La Boyera, up to the summit using public avenues and paved roads, taking from 15 minutes to 30 minutes depending on traffic on the area. The course apart from being used mostly for recreational purpose, also has been used for irregularly scheduled downhill races due to the lack of organisation in the riders community.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a Dive Coaster can vary {{slightly}} from one to another. Depending on the amusement park's request, one row on the train can seat anywhere from 6 to 10 riders. Stadium seating {{is also used to}} give every rider a clear view. Next, compared to standard Bolliger & Mabillard 4 abreast cars, because of the extra weight of each car on a Dive Coaster, the size of the track must be larger than other B models (such as the Hyper Coaster) to support the weight. At the top of the primary <b>vertical</b> <b>drop,</b> a braking system holds the train for 3 to 5 seconds, giving riders a view of the drop ahead before being released into the drop.|$|E
25|$|As {{its proponents}} had predicted, the tramway proved {{not only a}} sound {{financial}} investment for the state, but also confirmed the viability of skiing as an industry in New Hampshire. Cannon Mountain, with the highest <b>vertical</b> <b>drop</b> of any ski mountain in the state, became the pinnacle of Eastern skiing. The success of the state's venture attracted the interest and investment of the private sector, and the ski industry in New Hampshire grew and prospered.|$|E

5000|$|Jackson Hole Mountain Resort: The resort {{opened in}} 1966, 12 {{miles north of}} Jackson. It has {{abundant}} steep terrain and {{has one of the}} highest <b>vertical</b> <b>drops</b> in North America, at 4,139 feet (1,262 m).|$|R
25|$|The Olympic Village offers 2,000 beds in {{existing}} student housing with additional accommodations nearby if required. A bed/bath ratio of 6:1, or possibly 4:1 is proposed. One negative {{factor is the}} Alpine skiing facilities at Tahko ski resort would not permit all skiing events to be held due to its maximum <b>vertical</b> <b>drop</b> of 200m. Also, Kuopio proposes a natural track for Luge competition and Kuopio’s competition schedule does not include Bobsleigh/sled. Both figure skating and short track would be held at Kuopio Hall, by building a temporary wall on the ice.|$|E
25|$|The last {{establishment}} of a major skifield in NSW came {{with the development of}} Blue Cow Mountain in the 1980s. In 1987 the Swiss-designed Skitube Alpine Railway opened to deliver skiers from Bullocks Flat, on the Alpine Way, to Perisher Valley and to Blue Cow, which also opened in 1987. The operators of Blue Cow purchased Guthega in 1991, and the new combined resort later merged with Perisher-Smiggins to become the largest ski resort in the Southern Hemisphere. In 2011 Perisher had 47 lifts covering 1,245hectares and four village base areas: Perisher Valley (elevation 1720m), Blue Cow Terminal (1890m), Smiggin Holes (1680m) and Guthega (1640m). The resort is spread across seven mountain peaks, with the highest lifted point being Mount Perisher Double Chair at 2,034m and the greatest <b>vertical</b> <b>drop</b> on a single run being 355m from the Ridge Chair at Blue Cow.|$|E
25|$|By the 1850s the Fraser Canyon was {{transformed}} from a First Nations and fur trade corridor to a busy route, called the Cariboo Road, used by gold rush miners seeking access to the upper Fraser Basin. During the 1880s, the Canadian Pacific Railway built a new transcontinental railroad to unite the far-flung provinces of the young Dominion of Canada. This nation-building project saw new railroad tracks constructed on the west riverbank at Hells Gate, connecting the British Columbia coast to the Interior (and the rest of Canada) through the Fraser Canyon. Some assert that rocks and debris dumped into the river during construction of the CPR constricted the river flow and impeded salmon passage, {{though there is no}} documented historical or physical evidence to support this claim. By early 1911 the Canadian Northern Railway began a second transcontinental railway along the south and east bank of the canyon, which was completed in a year's time. While carving into canyon walls to create new rail-bed, rock and debris were again dumped into the river in significant volumes at various locations, including Hells Gate. In early 1914, two years after the completion of the CNR and during construction of a new tunnel, a large rockslide fell into the river just above the Hells Gate portal. Debris dispersed on the river bottom caused a 5-meter <b>vertical</b> <b>drop</b> in water depth and increased water velocity from five meters per second to 6.75m/second. As observed and noted by local residents and later by biologists {{in the aftermath of the}} slide, noticeably higher water velocity seemed to exceed the swimming capacity of the salmon, resulting in premature mortality and reduced populations of salmon fry in the subsequent year. In an initial attempt to redress the ecological and physical changes at Hells Gate that impeded migrating salmon, tons of rocks and debris were removed from the river during the winter of 1914-1915. By early 1915, Hells Gate was pronounced clear. While government officials declared that the river at Hells Gate was fully restored, many biologists maintain that the slide permanently altered the river's ecology.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} and analytical investigation {{was conducted to}} determine which characteristics of a light aircraft landing gear influence gear dynamic behavior significantly. The investigation focused particularly on possible modification for load control. Pseudostatic tests were conducted to determine the gear fore-and-aft spring constant, axial friction {{as a function of}} drag load, brake pressure-torque characteristics, and tire force-deflection characteristics. To study dynamic tire response, <b>vertical</b> <b>drops</b> were conducted at impact velocities of 1. 2, 1. 5, and 1. 8 m/s onto a level surface; to determine axial-friction effects, a second series of <b>vertical</b> <b>drops</b> were made at 1. 5 m/s onto surfaces inclined 5 deg and 10 deg to the horizontal. An average dynamic axial-friction coefficient of 0. 15 was obtained by comparing analytical data with inclined surface drop test data. Dynamic strut bending and associated axial friction were found to be severe for the drop tests on the 10 deg surface...|$|R

500|$|Black Moshannon State Park was {{the site}} of a ski resort from the 1960suntil 1982. The state {{legislature}} authorized [...] "construction of ski facilities" [...] at the park in 1961, which were operational by 1965. Although managed by the state, a commercial operator was sought as early as 1969, and in 1980 it was leased to a private contractor, before being closed in 1982. The ski area was primitive by modern standards: skiers were lifted {{to the top of the}} slope by one of two tow ropes or Poma lifts, and the slopes had about [...] of <b>vertical</b> <b>drop.</b> As of 2008, the ski lodge, renamed Cabin 20, remains open and is rented out to park visitors, while the Ski Slope Trail is a [...] hiking trail that passes near the former ski slope.

500|$|The {{roller coaster}} has a simple layout with a 180 ft drop at 87 degrees, meaning {{it does not}} have a true <b>vertical</b> <b>drop.</b> [...] The car slowly ascends 60 feet at a 45 degree angle to build tension, then levels out, slowly {{travelling}} around a curve on a unique chain system, seen only on Oblivion, as the cars approach the drop. As each car reaches the drop it is held by a holding chain for a maximum of five seconds, giving the rider {{a clear view of the}} long drop, before a brake is released allowing the car to drop into the tunnel. This is followed by a highly banked turn that climbs up and makes the train lie on its side as it goes through. Then after dropping out of the turn the train climbs over a small rise in the track to the brakes, slowing down, and then pulls around back to the station. The open design cars accommodate sixteen passengers in two rows of eight. The back row is slightly raised to give passengers a clear view of the drop. A pre-recorded and disembodied voice saying 'don't look down' was played just before release. In 2004, this sound effect was removed due to sound restrictions on the park and instead the words [...] "Don't look down" [...] have been painted on the floor of the guest observation area where the ride enters the ground. The words are clearly visible to riders when the train is hanging over the edge of the drop.|$|E
