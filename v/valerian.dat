5|$|On 22 January 2010, {{the last}} album, L'OuvreTemps (The Time Opener), was published. With this album the authors {{concluded}} the entire comic {{series with the}} intention to prevent the series from becoming weak, or staggering behind newer comics. However, Christin has written a 270-page <b>Valérian</b> and Laureline novel, <b>Valérian</b> et Laureline: Lininil a disparu (<b>Valérian</b> and Laureline: Lininil Has Disappeared), and indicated that <b>Valérian</b> and Laureline will continue to live on in a yet unspecified form.|$|E
5|$|In Nova Covert Ops, <b>Valerian</b> {{has been}} under {{pressure}} from the Defenders of Man, who oppose his rule. <b>Valerian</b> questions Nova when she returned to the Dominion after being missing for some time. <b>Valerian</b> believes her claim, that she didn't betray the Dominion and grants her her own covert ops team to discover what the Defenders of Man are up to. After Nova learns, that the Defenders are using psi emitters to lure zerg to Dominion Worlds to discredit him, and learning the identity of their leader, General Davis, <b>Valerian</b> contacts her and announces his wish to step down as the Emperor of the Dominion.|$|E
5|$|Many of the <b>Valérian</b> {{stories have}} been {{translated}} from their original French into several other languages, including German (as <b>Valerian</b> und Veronique), Dutch (as Ravian: Tijd/ruimte-agent), the Scandinavian languages (Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish) (as Linda og/och Valentin), Finnish (as Avaruusagentti Valérianin seikkailuja), Spanish, Portuguese (as <b>Valérian,</b> agente espácio-temporal), Serbian (as Valerijan), Italian, Turkish, Polish, Indonesian and Standard Chinese.|$|E
5|$|<b>Valerian</b> {{made his}} game debut in Wings of Liberty, voiced by Josh Keaton. He is confronted by Jim Raynor, mistaking {{him for his}} father Arcturus, aboard the Dominion battlecruiser Bucephalus. <b>Valerian</b> reveals {{that he is the}} owner of the Moebius Foundation, the think tank that Raynor had been {{collecting}} the pieces of a Xel'Naga artifact for, and claimed that his mission was the same as Raynor's – to rescue Kerrigan. Taking more than half the Dominion fleet, <b>Valerian</b> joins forces with Raynor's Raiders and lays siege to the Zerg stronghold of Char, {{as part of an effort}} to prove to the Dominion (and to his father) that he will be worthy to take the emperor's crown after Arcturus. Ultimately, the mission succeeds in de-infesting Kerrigan, but in the aftermath of the battle a disagreement between Arcturus and <b>Valerian</b> over Sara Kerrigan's fate sparks an armed civil war between the Emperor and Prince, leading <b>Valerian</b> and a faction of the Dominion's armed forces loyal to him to seek shelter with Raynor's Raiders.|$|E
5|$|<b>Valérian</b> first {{appeared}} on 9 November 1967 in issue #420 of the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Pilote, and every <b>Valérian</b> story from Bad Dreams to The Rage of Hypsis was initially serialised in Pilote. The second <b>Valérian</b> story, The City of Shifting Waters (La Cité des Eaux Mouvantes), {{was the first to}} be collected in graphic novel album format by Dargaud. Since On the Frontiers, every <b>Valérian</b> story has debuted in album format. Seven short stories were also published in the digest-sized Super Pocket Pilote in 1969 and 1970 and later collected in Across the Pathways of Space (Par Les Chemins De l’Espace) in 1997. The series was originally published under the title Valérian: Spatio-Temporal Agent. However, with the publication of The Order of the Stones in 2007, the series now goes under the title <b>Valérian</b> and Laureline.|$|E
5|$|Decius revives {{the office}} of Censor; the Senate acclaims <b>Valerian</b> as worthy {{to hold it in}} a decree dated 27 October 251. The decree is brought to Decius (on {{campaign}} against the Goths) and he summons <b>Valerian</b> to bestow the honour. The revival of the censorship is fictitious, and Decius had been dead for several months by the date stated.|$|E
5|$|In Heart of the Swarm, <b>Valerian</b> helps Raynor and his Raiders {{escape into}} the Umojan Protectorate, where Kerrigan {{undergoes}} extensive testing {{in a research}} lab. The lab is discovered and attacked by a Dominion task force, and <b>Valerian</b> and Kerrigan escape on board the Hyperion, the Raiders' flagship. <b>Valerian</b> is nearly psionically strangled by Kerrigan for leaving Raynor behind on the base. <b>Valerian</b> knew that his father {{would be willing to}} sacrifice him to destroy Kerrigan, even in spite of Hyperion captain Matt Horner warning the Dominion fleet that he was on board, and so he aided Kerrigan and the Raiders in searching for him. During the final assault against Korhal, <b>Valerian</b> recognized that Arcturus was beyond redemption, and asked only that Kerrigan minimize civilian casualties; Kerrigan thus elected to attend his request, recognizing him as a different man from his father. Kerrigan killed Arcturus shortly thereafter. Following {{the death of his father}} and the departure of the Zerg, <b>Valerian</b> assumed the throne and became the new Emperor of the Dominion. He immediately went to work rebuilding the Dominion, and enacted new laws to eliminate the corruption and abuse of power that had occurred during his father's reign. These reforms included abolishing forced military conscription and slave labor. He also reorganized a number of his father's secret projects, such as Project Blackstone.|$|E
5|$|In Legacy of the Void, {{not long}} after his {{ascension}} to the throne, Korhal {{and the rest of}} the Dominion are assaulted by Moebius Foundation under control of the fallen Xel'Naga, Amon. Alongside Raynor, he does everything in his power to save his people. When Artanis arrives, he aids Raynor and <b>Valerian</b> to repel the Moebius Foundation on Korhal. After Amon has been banished into the Void, <b>Valerian</b> allows Raynor to take the Dominion Fleet to Ulnar in order to help Kerrigan and Artanis to defeat Amon once for all. After Amon's defeat, <b>Valerian</b> has turned the Terran Dominion into a government of peace and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} stories Laureline {{generally}} {{sits in the}} background while <b>Valérian</b> saves the day in whatever situation the pair have found themselves, but her position changes as the series develops. World Without Stars, {{in which the two}} characters are separated for most of the adventure, allows Laureline to step out from under Valérian's shadow for the first time, and she proves to be more than an equal to <b>Valérian</b> in ensuring that their mission succeeds.|$|E
5|$|L'Empire des Mille Planètes (Empire of a Thousand Planets) premiered in Pilote in 1969 {{and marked}} a further {{development}} for the <b>Valérian</b> series and for Mézières art. This story was the series' first full-blown attempt at space opera and it {{set out for the}} first time the two main signature elements of Valérian: the use of science fiction as a political allegory and Mézières' meticulously detailed depictions of alien worlds. The follow-up story World Without Stars saw the final evolution of Mézières' art into the style that became prevalent in the <b>Valerian</b> stories of the 1970s and 1980s, with the first realistic renderings of <b>Valérian</b> and Laureline, as opposed to the caricatures of the earlier stories.|$|E
5|$|Laureline is {{a peasant}} girl from 11th century France. In the debut adventure, Bad Dreams, she rescues <b>Valérian</b> from the enchanted Forest of Arelaune. When she accidentally discovers <b>Valérian</b> is a time-traveller, he {{is forced to}} bring her back with him to Galaxity where she is trained as a Spatio-Temporal Agent and {{assigned}} as his partner.|$|E
5|$|Outside of comics, the <b>Valérian</b> {{series has}} been {{particularly}} influential on science fiction and fantasy film.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Valérian</b> and Laureline (1967 – present) – {{drawn by}} Mézières, written by Pierre Christin. The classic comic strip series {{depicting}} {{the adventures of}} spatio-temporal agent <b>Valérian</b> and his feisty redhead companion, Laureline, as they travel through space and time is Mézières' most widely known and best-selling work. Seven of the albums have been translated into English.|$|E
5|$|The series {{differs from}} the {{original}} comics in that <b>Valerian</b> comes from the year 2417, instead of 2720, and meets Laureline in the year 912 instead of 1000. Whereas in the comics <b>Valerian</b> takes Laureline back to the 28th century without any trouble, in the animated series this results in Earth disappearing from the solar system.|$|E
5|$|Trebellius Pollio (4 lives): <b>Valerian,</b> Gallienus, Tyranni Triginta and Claudius.|$|E
5|$|An {{animated}} series entitled Time Jam: <b>Valerian</b> and Laureline {{made its}} debut on Canal+ Family in France on 20 October 2007. In total, forty 26-minute episodes have been made. The series is a Franco–Japanese co-production, directed by Philippe Vidal.|$|E
5|$|Certainly, the Sassanids had {{not been}} cowed by the {{previous}} battles with Rome and in 253 AD the Sassanids under Shapur I penetrated deeply into Roman territory several times, defeating a Roman force at the Battle of Barbalissos and conquering and plundering Antiochia in 252 AD following the Siege of Antiochia. The Romans recovered Antioch by 253 AD, and Emperor <b>Valerian</b> gathered an army and marched eastward to the Sassanid borders. In 260 AD at the Battle of Edessa the Sassanids defeated the Roman army and captured the Roman Emperor <b>Valerian.</b>|$|E
5|$|Christin {{has also}} cited the whodunit genre—notably novels by Georges Simenon and Ed McBain—as an {{influence}} on <b>Valérian</b> since they taught him, as a writer, that all characters in a narrative must be seen to have motivations.|$|E
5|$|Eventually accumulating all the artifacts, the Raiders {{discover}} that the Moebius Foundation is a front for the heir apparent of the Dominion, <b>Valerian</b> Mengsk; though the Hyperion crew is concerned about having been working for their enemy, <b>Valerian</b> coaxes Raynor to accompany him in invading Char as the combined artifact may reverse Kerrigan's infestation. Although the Dominion takes heavy losses to the Zerg, the Raiders defend the artifact from Kerrigan until it can be activated; upon detonating, it destroys all nearby Zerg and leaves Kerrigan human again. However, Findlay, acting on orders from Arcturus Mengsk, attempts to kill the weakened Kerrigan, forcing Raynor to kill Findlay before tending to Kerrigan.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two albums <b>Valérian</b> travels through time in a {{two-seater}} device, the XB27, which transports him to the various relay stations that Galaxity has hidden throughout time (e.g. in Bad Dreams (Les Mauvais Rêves) the relay is hidden below a tavern). In subsequent stories <b>Valérian</b> and Laureline use the saucer-shaped Astroship XB982 (which made its debut appearance in 1969 in the short story The Great Collector (Le Grand Collectionneur). The astroship is able to travel anywhere using a spatio-temporal jump, a sort of hyperspace drive enabling near-instant transportation anywhere in space and time.|$|E
5|$|Mézières et Christin avec... (1983) – {{compilation}} of early work, {{including the first}} publication of the <b>Valérian</b> story Bad Dreams in an album as well as Mon Amérique à moi and the strips Mézières produced for Métal Hurlant.|$|E
5|$|The series {{focuses on}} the adventures of the dark-haired <b>Valérian,</b> a spatio-temporal agent, and his redheaded female colleague, Laureline, as they travel the {{universe}} through space and time. <b>Valérian</b> is a classical hero, kind, strong and brave who follows the orders of his superiors even if he feels, deep down, {{that it is the}} wrong thing to do. On the other hand, his partner Laureline combines her superior intelligence, determination and independence with sex-appeal. Influenced by classic literary science fiction, the series mixes space opera with time travel plots. Christin's scripts are noted for their humour, complexity and strongly humanist and left-wing liberal political ideas while Mézières' art is characterized by its vivid depictions of the alien worlds and species <b>Valérian</b> and Laureline encounter on their adventures. The series is considered a landmark in European comics and pop culture, and influenced other media as well: traces of its concepts, storylines and designs can be found in science fiction films such as Star Wars and The Fifth Element.|$|E
5|$|<b>Valérian</b> {{has also}} been {{nominated}} for a Haxtur Award in 1995 for The Circles of Power and for a Harvey Award in 2005 for The New Future Trilogy, an English-language compilation {{of three of the}} albums.|$|E
5|$|Welcome to Alflolol (Bienvenue sur Alflolol) brings Laureline's rebellious {{nature to}} the fore; unlike <b>Valérian,</b> {{she has not}} been born and raised by Galaxity and is {{prepared}} not only to question Galaxity's authorities but to rebel openly against them when their orders run contrary to her sense of morality. It also demonstrates her impulsive streak; she sides with the native Alflololians against Galaxity and <b>Valérian</b> with no thought for the personal consequences she may have to face herself. Her position as the true star of the series is cemented in Ambassador of the Shadows (L'Ambassadeur des Ombres), which is virtually a solo adventure for her as she searches the vast space station Point Central for the kidnapped <b>Valérian</b> and the Earth Ambassador. Later, when acting as independent agents, it is Laureline who questions the ethics of some of the jobs they are forced to take to make ends meet, notably in The Living Weapons (Les Armes Vivantes).|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as he has been working on <b>Valérian</b> and various film and {{television}} projects, Mézières has worked extensively producing illustrations and comic strips for magazines and newspapers such as Pilote, Métal Hurlant and Le Monde, covers for books, art for advertising campaigns, etc. For Le Monde, in 1993, he was a regular illustrator for the Heures Locales column.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} centuries AD, Palmyra {{was a city}} {{subordinate}} to Rome {{and part of the}} province of Syria Phoenice. In 260 the Roman emperor <b>Valerian</b> marched against the Sassanid Persian monarch Shapur I, who had invaded the empire's eastern regions; <b>Valerian</b> was defeated and captured near Edessa. Odaenathus, formally loyal to Rome and its emperor Gallienus (Valerian's son), was declared king of Palmyra. Launching successful campaigns against Persia, he was crowned King of Kings of the East in 263. Odaenathus crowned his eldest son, Herodianus, as co-ruler. In addition to the royal titles, Odaenathus received many Roman titles, most importantly corrector totius orientis (governor of the entire East), and ruled the Roman territories from the Black Sea to Palestine. In 267, when Zenobia was in her late twenties or early thirties, Odaenathus and his eldest son were assassinated while returning from a campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 Mézières {{began work}} {{producing}} concept art for the director Luc Besson for his film The Fifth Element. When the project stalled and Besson {{moved on to}} work on the film Léon in 1994, Mézières returned to <b>Valérian</b> for the album The Circles of Power (Les Cercles du Pouvoir). This featured a character, S'Traks, who drove a flying taxi around a great metropolis on the planet Rubanis. Mézières sent a copy of the album to Besson who was inspired to change the background of Korben Dallas, the lead character of The Fifth Element, from a worker in a rocketship factory to that of a taxi driver who flies his cab around a Rubanis-inspired futuristic New York City. Mézières produced further concept drawings for Besson, including flying taxi cabs. He also re-used certain aspects of the design of the space liner seen in the 1988 <b>Valérian</b> album On the Frontiers for the Fhloston Paradise liner seen in second half of the film. The Fifth Element was finally completed and released in 1997. The importance of the four classical elements to the film is similar to the significance the elements have in the two-part <b>Valérian</b> story Métro Châtelet, Direction Cassiopeia and Brooklyn Station, Terminus Cosmos. However, Besson has claimed that he first {{came up with the idea}} for the film at the age of 16 which would pre-date the publication of these two albums.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, it was {{announced}} that Luc Besson planned to make a movie for the big screen of <b>Valérian</b> and Laureline. The film was shot in January 2016 and stars Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne. It was released on July 21, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the stories}} have been {{translated}} into several languages, including English. The series has received recognition {{through a number of}} prestigious awards, including the Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême. An animated television series, , was released in 2007, and a feature film directed by Luc Besson, <b>Valerian</b> and the City of a Thousand Planets, was released in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Mézières {{has also}} noticed {{similarities}} between {{some of the}} sets in the 1982 film Conan the Barbarian and the planet seen in Birds of the Master (Les Oiseaux du Maître) and between some of the production sketches for the alien fighters in the 1996 film Independence Day and <b>Valérian</b> and Laureline's astroship.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August 1979 at Schloss Waldstein in Austria, Van der Byl married Princess Charlotte Maria Benedikte Eleonore Adelheid of Liechtenstein. She {{was thirty}} years his junior, the {{daughter}} of Prince Heinrich of Liechtenstein and granddaughter of Karl I, the last emperor of Austria. The couple had three sons: Pieter Vincenz, <b>Valerian,</b> and Casimir.|$|E
5|$|Raynor is {{the protagonist}} and player {{character}} of StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty. Over {{the course of}} the campaign Raynor's Raiders (as his army is known) fight the Zerg and Mengsk's empire simultaneously. At the behest of a group known as the Moebius Foundation, the Raiders gather the pieces of a Xel'Naga artifact, until it is revealed that the foundation is actually led by <b>Valerian</b> Mengsk, Arcturus's son. <b>Valerian</b> intends to use the artifact's power to destroy the Queen of Blades, proving to the empire's citizens that he will be a worthy successor to the throne. Raynor begrudgingly finishes assembling the artifact and joins the imperial army in an assault on the Zerg homeworld of Char, but not before uncovering proof of Mengsk's treachery on Tarsonis and broadcasting it across the sector. The Terran forces on Char use the artifact to partially restore Kerrigan's humanity, significantly weakening her, but Raynor refuses to kill her.|$|E
5|$|The 1999 Danish film Mifune's Last Song, {{directed}} by Søren Kragh-Jacobsen, features a character, Rud, {{who is a}} fan of Linda and Valentin (as <b>Valérian</b> is known in Denmark) who believes the character of Liva is in fact Linda (i.e. Laureline).|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat and}} captivity of emperor <b>Valerian</b> {{at the hands}} of the Persian Sassanian monarch Shapur I in 260 left the eastern Roman provinces largely at the mercy of the Persians. Odaenathus stayed on the side of Rome; {{assuming}} the title of king, he led the Palmyrene army and fell upon the Persians before they could cross the Euphrates to the eastern bank, and inflicted upon them a considerable defeat. Then, Odaenathus took the side of emperor Gallienus, the son and successor of <b>Valerian,</b> who was facing the usurpation of Fulvius Macrianus. The rebel declared his sons emperors, leaving one in Syria and taking the other with him to Europe. Odaenathus attacked the remaining usurper and quelled the rebellion. He was rewarded many exceptional titles by the emperor who formalized his self-established position in the East. In reality, the emperor could have done little but to accept the declared nominal loyalty of Odaenathus.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>Valérian</b> {{album to}} be {{translated}} into English was Ambassador of the Shadows which was serialised across four issues of the magazine Heavy Metal in 1981 (Volume 4, Number 10 (January 1981) to Volume 5, Number 1 (April 1981)).|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} <b>Valérian,</b> however, {{has led to}} Mézières {{becoming}} involved in a number of, mainly science fiction, film and television projects. The first of these was Billet Doux (Love Letter), a 1984 television series starring Pierre Mondy as a comic strip editor for which Mézières mocked up comic book covers and characters.|$|E
