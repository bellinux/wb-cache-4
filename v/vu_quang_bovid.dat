50|$|The saola, siola, Vu Quang ox, spindlehorn, or Asian bicorn, also, infrequently, <b>Vu</b> <b>Quang</b> <b>bovid</b> (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis), {{is one of}} the world's rarest large mammals, a forest-dwelling bovine {{found only}} in the Annamite Range of Vietnam and Laos. Related to cattle, goats, and antelopes, the species was defined {{following}} a discovery of remains in 1992 in Vũ Quang Nature Reserve by a joint survey of the Vietnamese Ministry of Forestry and the World Wide Fund for Nature. Saolas have since been kept in captivity multiple times, although only for short periods. A living saola in the wild was first photographed in 1999 by a camera trap set by WWF and the Vietnamese government’s Forest Protection Department (SFNC).|$|E

Saola and Giant muntjac are species found in this park. <b>Vũ</b> <b>Quang</b> is a remote forested region of Vietnam, in which several new species of deer and antelope have been discovered since the 1990s. Some are so new that scientific description is still pending, although most have local names.|$|R

Another 15 bases were built along the mountain to complement the headquarters at <b>Vu</b> <b>Quang.</b> Each base had a subordinate commander leading units numbering between 100 and 500 men. The operations were funded by local villagers, who were levied with a land tax in silver and rice.

It rains continually in the rainy season, and in the dry season there is much fog; consequently most surfaces are algae-coated and slippery.

5|$|Phan {{initially}} rallied {{support from}} his native village and set up his headquarters on Mount <b>Vũ</b> <b>Quang,</b> which overlooked the coastal French fortress at Hà Tĩnh. Phan's organisation became a model for future insurgents. For flexibility, he divided his operational zone into twelve districts. His forces upheld military discipline and wore uniforms. Phan initially used the local scholar-gentry as his military commanders. Their first notable attack targeted two nearby Catholic villages that had collaborated with French forces. Colonial troops arrived a few hours later, quickly overwhelming the rebels and forcing them to retreat to their home village, where the retribution was heavy. Phan managed to escape but his elder brother was captured by the same former viceroy of northern Vietnam who {{had been removed from}} office as a result of Phan's critical report.

5|$|Nevertheless, the {{weaponry}} used by Phan's rebels was far {{inferior to}} that of their adversaries, and their inland positions were within firing range of the French Navy. The Vietnamese could not rely on China to give them material support, and other European powers such as Portugal, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were unwilling to sell them weapons for various reasons. Thus, Phan had to explore overland routes to procure weapons from Siamese sourcesusing seafaring transport was impossible due {{to the presence of}} the French Navy. He instructed his followers to create a secret route from Hà Tĩnh through Laos into northeastern Siam; one such route from Mount <b>Vu</b> <b>Quang</b> was believed to have been created around 1888. It is unclear if Phan himself went to Thailand, but a young female supporter named Co Tam was his designated arms buyer in Tha Uthen, which boasted a substantial expatriate Vietnamese community. In 1890, the Siamese Army transported around 1,000 Austrian repeating-rifles from Bangkok to Luang Prabang in Laos. However, it is unclear whether the weapons found their way into Vietnamese hands or whether they were related to Co Tam's activities.|$|R
