50|$|Age, gender, {{and height}} {{have all been}} shown to impact an individual’s ability to balance and the {{assessment}} of that balance. Typically, older adults have more body sway with all testing conditions. Tests have shown that older adults demonstrate shorter functional reach and larger body sway path lengths. Height also influences body sway in that as height increases, functional reach typically decreases. However, this test is only a measure of anterior and posterior sway. This is done to create a repeatable and reliable clinical balance assessment tool. A 2011 Cochrane Review found that specific types of exercise (such as gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks; strengthening exercises; 3D exercises Tai Chi and combinations of these) can help improve balance in older adults. However, there was no or limited evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} general physical activities, such as walking and cycling, computer-based balance games and <b>vibration</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|E

40|$|Equine foot {{pain can}} {{be a result of}} many {{conditions}} and disease processes, all of which lead to a loss of function in the horse. When the horse loads the foot, pressure applied to the frog translates to the digital cushion and lateral cartilages, compressing the blood vessels, perfusing the area, and circulating blood back up the leg; this constant flow of blood stimulates growth of the hoof wall. Whole body <b>vibration</b> <b>plates</b> are thought to result in rapid muscle contractions and subsequently, increased circulation through the foot. An increase in hoof growth could prove whole body vibration beneficial as both a treatment option and a preventative care option for horses with damaged, injured, or slow-growing hooves. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if horses treated using whole body <b>vibration</b> <b>plates</b> have significantly different hoof growth when compared to control horses. Data were collected over two separate 12 -week time periods. A total of 24 horses were randomly allocated to either the control (n= 12) or experimental group (n= 12) for the study duration. During Trial 1, horses in the experimental group stood on the plate for 15 minutes per day, 5 days per week. During Trial 2, horses in the experimental group stood on the plate for 20 minutes per day, 5 days per week. On the first day of each trial, a score was made at the quarters of each hoof, just under the coronary band. As the hoof grew, this mark allowed measurement of how much growth occurred by measuring the distance from the mark to the coronary band. Mean hoof growth results for control and experimental groups were compared using independent t-tests with a cutoff significance level of PP= 0. 058) for increased overall hoof growth by the experimental group (mean 19. 3 cm per hoof ± 2. 5 cm) when compared to controls (mean 17. 7 cm per hoof ± 1. 2 cm).

The effects of the initial concentrations of extractant, nickel, and proton, and the mean residence time of both solutions in the extractor on the extraction rate of nickel, were measured.

40|$|Abstract Background This {{systematic}} review {{was performed to}} summarize the current evidence for whole body vibration (WBV) interventions on postural control in elderly. Methods English and German language papers in Medline, PEDro, Cinahl and the Cochrane databases were searched. Two reviewers extracted data on patients' characteristics, type of WBV intervention and outcomes. Two independent reviewers rated the methodological quality of these studies. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Results Fifteen papers reporting quantitative data were included. Results from 15 papers could be pooled for a meta-analysis. The studies involved 933 participants. In 7 studies the authors investigated the effects of <b>vibration</b> <b>plates</b> generating vertical sinusoidal vibrations (VS-WBV) and 7 papers described the use of side-alternating sinusoidal vibrations (SS-WBV). One study investigated both VS-WBV and SS-WBV. Weak to moderate evidence of an overall effect {{as a result of}} VS-WBV and SS-WBV was observed for (a) static balance for post-intervention values with a standardized mean difference (SMD) - 0. 06, 95 % CI - 0. 31 to 0. 18 and for change values SMD - 0. 26, 95 % CI - 1. 09 to 0. 57, and (b) dynamic balance for post-intervention-values SMD - 0. 34, 95 % CI - 0. 60 to - 0. 08. For functional balance (c) an overall outcome for post-intervention values with SMD of 0. 34, 95 % CI - 0. 19 to 0. 87 was found. Conclusions The 15 studies reviewed were of moderate methodological quality. In summary, SS-WBV seems to have a beneficial effect on dynamic balance in elderly individuals. However, the current results should be interpreted with caution because of the observed heterogeneity of training parameters and statistical methods. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the effects of WBV on postural control in an elderly population. </p...|$|E

Fourty three young men were included in the study and randomized into three groups: one group without training (control group), one group with upper extremity training with the Galileo (galileo group), and one group with upper extremity training with the PowerPlate (power plate group). The 43 test subjects at the age of 18 to 30 years voluntarily participated in the study. None of them were engaged in regular organized physical activities nor in sports or strength training before. Reasons for exclusion were pregnancy, acute hernia, and any history of severe musculoskeletal problems. They were examined over a 10 weeks period where two training groups accomplished a selective leg muscle strength training program. Effects were assessed by hand grip strength, several tests on jump plate (two leg, one leg, drop, and land test jumps), short distance sprints and the muscle-area (upper extremity). The jump altitude was registered using a jump mat (Leonardo Ground Reaction Force Platform, Fa. Novotec). The muscel area was registered using a MRI. All intervention programs consisted of 20 training sessions within a 10 -wk period. Training frequency was two times a week. A training program with the Galileo and the Power-Plate was accomplished within 5 to 10 minutes per session. Simultaneously a control group without any training experience was examined for the development of their muscle-area (upper-extremity), their jump altitude and their short distance sprint times. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the changes of some main parameters. Linearity was assumed and seems reasonable regarding the plotted absolute changes. Maximum relative power of two leg jump shows a significant change in time but no group differences. Sprint time does not show any change in time and no group differences.
