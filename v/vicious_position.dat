40|$|The {{analysis}} of treatment of 21 patients (24 feet) with postoperative hallux varus deformity which have arisen after operations apropos hallux valgus is carried out. For correction of <b>vicious</b> <b>position</b> {{of the first}} finger we successfully carried out the Brandes procedure, sometimes in a combination to operations on sinews of muscles of the first finger - an adductor hallucis tendotomy and/or lengthening of the extensor hallucis longus tendon. </span...|$|E
40|$|Lumbosacral {{spine and}} hip joints {{is a complex}} {{physiological}} functions of the co-operation {{of a large number}} of anatomical structures. Lesions of the links in the system can mutually afflict each other. Combined pathology of the hip and lumbosacral spine is called hip-spine syndrome, or coxa-vertebral syndrome. Symptoms of the joint and spine are very similar and only a careful examination and clinical examination may find the differences. As the disease progresses the hip increases the restriction of movement, there is a contracture of the limbs in a <b>vicious</b> <b>position,</b> which leads to an increase in tilt of the pelvis, increased lumbar lordosis and to functional shortening of limbs on the affected side. This gives rise to functional impairment, and then strain the joints of his spine and disease - osteochondrosis and scoliosis. After the successful operation of total hip replacement is often progressive clinical lesions of vertebral segment, which is manifested pain and is often offset by the results of arthroplasty as the restoration of movement in the hip joint, and the change in length limb after arthroplasty leads to rupture formed a functional stereotype change in the mobility of the lumbar spine, pelvis regression bias that causes the dynamic compression spinal nerve root. Depending on the duration of the existence, severity and nature of changes in the pelvic girdle is suitable correction of equipment replacement surgery, including, for example, in some cases, deliberate shortening or lengthening the preservation of the lower extremity, offset change, etc...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{developing}} countries hip osteoarthritis constitutes {{a major public}} health issue as it is highly prevalent in all age ranges of population, including the young. It often remains untreated because of the low accessibility of total hip prostheses. Hip arthrodesis still represents a major treatment option, but, for several reasons which are discussed in this paper, is nowadays infrequently performed. By means of reporting {{the results of a}} new simple technique, using a self-devised plate, the relevancy of hip arthrodesis in this particular environment is emphasized. Methods and Findings: Our series included 35 patients with painful hip osteoarthritis who underwent a hip fusion with the anterolateral arthrodesis plate. Two of them had a concurrent femoral osteotomy for correction of a <b>vicious</b> <b>position</b> of the limb and another patient had a femoral diaphysis osteotomy and placement of a Wagner elongating device in order to proceed with a limb lengthening by callotasis. The follow-up period averaged 16, 9 months (9 to 34). All hips, except two, achieved solid fusion between 6 and 15 months after surgery. One failure of fusion was in the oldest patient, who presented a loosening of plate and screws due to an advanced degree of osteoporosis; the other was in a young patient who admitted having walked on his leg too soon. Patient satisfaction was high. We concluded that this technique is reliable and effective. Conclusions: The results of this study should convince the hesitant surgeon and patient to consider hip arthrodesis an acceptable treatment option for disabling hip arthritis, compared to no treatment at all...|$|E
40|$|Primary coxarthrosis is a {{disorder}} {{of the hip}} {{that may lead to}} a decrease in the quality of life due to the presence of pain, <b>vicious</b> <b>positions,</b> joint stiffness, and decrease in the joint range of motion. In this article, the role and importance of kinesiotherapeutic treatment along with drug therapy in the recovery of patients with primary coxarthrosis was studied. Kinesiotherapy administered to patients in the study group (medication and kinesiotherapy) contributed to the increase of the joint angle values {{at the level of the}} coxofemoral joint and muscle strength. The Womac test performed at the end of treatment (day 12) in the study group shows a decrease in pain intensity and a reduction of joint stiffness compared to day 1, before the initiation of treatment. The Lequesne functional index applied at the end of the 12 days of treatment from statistical analysis shows that patients can easily walk longer distances and can perform daily activities more easily, which results in an increase in their quality of life...|$|R
5|$|Minton was {{a fierce}} {{partisan}} {{during his time}} in the Senate, and regularly abused his opponents verbally. Democratic Senator Huey Long became one of Minton's favorite targets because of Long's often-threatened filibusters. During one of the filibusters, Long threatened to join the Republican Party. After most senators had left the chamber, Minton remained for several hours to periodically taunt Long. After tiring of the taunts, Long launched a rebuttal from the podium, calling Minton a <b>vicious</b> politician whose <b>positions</b> would cost Minton re-election. The exchange was unusual for its tone and later made national news.|$|R
40|$|In “Weak Inferential Internalism ” I {{defended the}} {{frequently}} voiced criticism that any internalist account of inferential justification generates a vicious regress. My defense involved criticizing a recent form of internalism, “Weak Inferential Internalism ” (WII) defended by Hookway and Rhoda. I argued that while WII does not generate a <b>vicious</b> regress, the <b>position</b> is only distinguishable from externalism {{insofar as it}} makes an arbitrary distinction between individuals who believe for the very same reason. Either way, WII is not a defensible internalist account of inferential justification. In his “In Defense of Weak Inferential Internalism, ” Rhoda has responded to my dilemma argument. He argues that it is mistaken to assume that WII must be incompatible with externalism, and that contrary to my claims, WII is distinguishable from externalism in several ways. In this reply, I explain why none of Rhoda’s replies {{suggest that there is}} a defensible internalist account of inferential justification...|$|R
