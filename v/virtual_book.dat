50|$|Elizabeth Neville {{must have}} been closely {{associated}} with Byrd, whether as pupil or patron is not known, but the book was most probably a gift to her.

At some time it was presented to Queen Elizabeth by Sir Henry Neville, and then passed through various hands until it was given back in 1668 to an unknown Neville descendant. The book was preserved by the Neville family {{until the end of}} the eighteenth century, when it passed through several collectors' hands until it returned to the possession of William Nevill, 1st Marquess of Abergavenny. In 2006 it was accepted by HM Government in lieu of Inheritance Tax, and allocated to the British Library.

5000|$|Initially {{a member}} of the Union of Communist Students with {{influences}} from the libertarian socialist group Socialisme ou Barbarie, Clastres became disenchanted with Communism after the raising of Stalinism and abandoned the French Communist Party in 1956, seeking for a new point of view. In François Dosse's words, for Clastres and other adherents of Lévi-Strauss's Structural anthropology, [...] "it was a matter of locating societies that had been sheltered from the unitary map of Hegelian Marxist thinking, societies that were not classified in Stalinist handbooks." [...] Although initially adept of Structuralism, Abensour wrote that [...] "Clastres is neither Structuralist, nor Marxist." [...] Similarly, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro declared Society Against the State and Archeology of Violence can be considered [...] "the chapters of a <b>virtual</b> <b>book</b> that could be named Neither Marxism nor Structuralism." [...] For Clastres, in Viveiros de Castro's words, [...] "both privileged economic rationality and suppressed political intentionality." ...|$|E
5000|$|For Senghor on the Rocks a book metaphor {{was used}} to design a user {{interface}} providing functionalities users/ readers are already familiar with. Once [...] "opened" [...] every page of text in the <b>virtual</b> <b>book</b> {{is accompanied by a}} satellite view of the current location of the story. [...] "As with a physical book, readers can judge the position in the novel by looking at the block of pages to the left and right of the current page. A virtual bookmark is automatically inserted when the reader leaves the page, to bring her back to that page with a single click on the next visit." [...] The covers that have been designed for the three parts of the novel advertise their content and serve as the main entry points into the story. The collages for the covers - composed mainly from material recorded at original locations - focus on the book's content and by that obfuscate the technical aspects of the project. On the top level, these [...] "covers" [...] act as an iconographic representation of the project that frequently was quoted in the form of screen shots on blogs and other media.|$|E

Among {{the more popular}} galleries are the Sisse Singhs Art Gallery, the Windlight art Gallery and the Horus Art Gallery. Among the most notable of these was the art gallery sim Cetus Gallery District, the world's first virtual online urban arts district. Cetus was modeled on real world analogs such as New York's Chelsea gallery district as a mixed-use arts community of virtual galleries, offices, loft apartments, and coffee houses. Its many tenant-run businesses featured weekly live music performances, gallery openings, and literary {{events such as the}} <b>virtual</b> <b>book</b> launch for [...] "Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human," [...] by Tom Boellstorf (Princeton University Press; 2008). Cetus was chosen Best Cultural Site in Second Life in 2007, and its creator avatar Xander Ruttan (real world arts professional Aaron Collins of California), was among the most influential art world avatars in SL. Cetus resulted in many ongoing collaborative efforts among the SL community of artists, designers, writers, and virtual builders from across the real and virtual worlds. (Cetus was later bought by virtual artist DB Bailey and converted into a personal art project).|$|E
