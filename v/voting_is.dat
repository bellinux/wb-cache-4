5|$|The National Basketball Association's Executive of the Year Award is {{an annual}} award given since the 1972–73 NBA season, to the league's best general manager. Before 2009, the Executive of the Year was {{presented}} annually by Sporting News, but was officially {{recognized by the}} NBA. Since 2009, the award has been awarded by the NBA. <b>Voting</b> <b>is</b> conducted by executives from the league's 30 teams. The person with the most number of votes wins the award.|$|E
5|$|The trophy {{has been}} won the most times by rookies from the Toronto Maple Leafs, {{who have won}} it on ten occasions, with the most recent being Auston Matthews in 2017. The <b>voting</b> <b>is</b> {{conducted}} {{at the end of}} the regular season by members of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association, and each individual voter ranks their top five candidates on a 10–7–5–3–1 points system. Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|The <b>voting</b> <b>is</b> {{conducted}} {{at the end of}} the regular season by the 30 general managers of the teams in the National Hockey League, with all individual voters ranking their top three candidates on a 5–3–1 points system. Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Voting</b> <b>is</b> {{regarded}} as key to representative democracy, which {{requires that the}} leaders of a country are elected by the people. The basis of this concept is that everyone should be treated equally and everyone has equal rights. Every person, therefore, {{has a right to}} one vote, and no more, in the choice of representatives. The right to vote is a primary right, a right of fundamental importance by which other rights are protected. It is one of the important bulwarks of a representative democracy and in this regard, the ballot box is the people's ultimate mechanism to control the shaping of government policies. However, it must be recognized that <b>voting</b> <b>is</b> not an infallible litmus test for democracy; rather, it functions as a procedural device that is normally {{regarded as}} the best instrument for securing the ideal of self-governance.|$|E
5|$|A mayor-council {{government}} {{has been in place}} in Tulsa since 1989 when the city converted from a city commission government deemed wasteful and less efficient. Since the change, Tulsa mayors have been given more power in accordance with a strong mayoral system and have greater control of a more consolidated array of governmental branches. Plurality <b>voting</b> <b>is</b> used to elect mayors, who serve a term in office of four years. The present mayor of Tulsa is Republican G. T. Bynum who won the 2016 mayoral election and took office on December 5, 2016. Another Tulsa political figure, Jim Inhofe, who now represents Oklahoma in the United States Senate, served as the mayor of Tulsa early in his political career.|$|E
25|$|On 25 August 2009, the Chief Electoral Officer {{released}} {{the results of}} the referendum. According to the results, 11.98% of valid <b>votes</b> <b>were</b> Yes <b>votes,</b> and 87.4% of <b>votes</b> <b>were</b> No <b>votes.</b> Voter turnout <b>was</b> 56.09%, and 0.1% of <b>votes</b> <b>were</b> invalid.|$|R
50|$|The {{members of}} the {{committee}} has one vote in each category, in which they indicate their first, second and third choice, respectively. The <b>votes</b> <b>are</b> then distributed after the first choice, where the choice has collected the fewest <b>votes</b> <b>are</b> discarded. These <b>votes</b> <b>are</b> later distributed to the remaining candidates, now after their second choice. Then the process starts over and the <b>votes</b> <b>are</b> counted on again and the candidate with the least <b>votes</b> <b>is</b> removed and distributed over their second choice.|$|R

5|$|During the 2009 {{parliamentary}} {{debate on the}} right to vote's status, Thio Li-ann proposed that, to avoid doubt, the right should be specifically set out in the Constitution. She argued that entrenching the right to vote through an Article in the Constitution would provide the opportunity to protect the details of the right. Currently, <b>voting</b> <b>is</b> regulated by the PEA. As it is an ordinary statute, it can be altered with a simple parliamentary majority by future governments seeking to amend or restrict voting rights. Thio said that expressing the right to vote clearly in the Constitution would allow aspects of that right such as voter secrecy and the universality and equality of votes to be protected from unjust manipulation.|$|E
5|$|Each {{state has}} a unicameral State Legislative Assembly whose members are elected from {{single-member}} constituencies. State governments are led by Chief Ministers, who are state assembly members from the majority party in the assembly. In each of the states with a hereditary ruler, the Chief Minister is normally required to be a Malay, appointed by the ruler upon {{the recommendation of the}} Prime Minister. Parliamentary elections are held at least once every five years, the most recent of which took place in May 2013. Registered voters of age 21 and above may vote for the members of the House of Representatives and, in most of the states, for the state legislative chamber. <b>Voting</b> <b>is</b> not mandatory. Except for state elections in Sarawak, by convention state elections are held concurrently with the federal election.|$|E
5|$|In Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor (1998), the High Court {{suggested}} on an obiter {{basis that}} <b>voting</b> <b>is</b> a privilege {{rather than a}} right. It has been suggested by law academic Thio Li-ann that, if called upon to decide the issue, the court might infer {{the existence of the}} right to vote in the Constitution from its text and structure, and {{from the fact that it}} is an adaptation of the Westminster system of democracy. If the right to vote were to be found to be implicit in the Constitution, the judiciary would be better able to protect the right when issues arise before the courts.|$|E
5000|$|Note: Conservative <b>vote</b> <b>is</b> {{compared}} to Government vote in 1917 election, and Liberal <b>vote</b> <b>is</b> {{compared to}} Opposition <b>vote.</b> Popular <b>vote</b> <b>is</b> {{compared to the}} party's total share {{of the popular vote}} in the 1917 general election.|$|R
50|$|Swailes's {{surplus of}} 89 <b>votes</b> <b>was</b> not transferred, {{as it was}} too low to change the {{relevant}} candidate order. Juba's surplus of 57 <b>votes</b> <b>was</b> also not transferred, for the same reason. Murphy was eliminated, and her 1,991 <b>votes</b> <b>were</b> distributed as follows: St. John 1309, Scott 205, Stubbs 163. 314 <b>votes</b> <b>were</b> non-transferable. St. John was declared elected to the third position.|$|R
50|$|The LCL did not contest nine seats, Labor did not contest three seats. Labor's two-party <b>vote</b> <b>is</b> {{lower than}} their primary vote, {{as the primary}} <b>vote</b> <b>was</b> counted on seats contested, while the two-party <b>vote</b> <b>was</b> {{estimated}} for all seats.|$|R
5|$|Note 2. The fencing {{programme}} included six individual {{events and}} four team events, though the team events were {{a different set}} than were held in 2004. The International Fencing Federation's rules call for events not held in the previous Games to receive automatic selection and {{for at least one}} team event in each weapon to be held. <b>Voting</b> <b>is</b> conducted to determine the fourth event. In 2004, the three men's team events and the women's épée were held. Thus, in 2008, the women's foil and sabre events and men's épée were automatically selected. Men's sabre was chosen over foil by a 45–20 vote.|$|E
5|$|The All-NBA Team is {{an annual}} National Basketball Association (NBA) honor {{bestowed}} {{on the best}} players in the league following every NBA season. The <b>voting</b> <b>is</b> conducted by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters throughout the United States and Canada. The team has been selected in every season of the league's existence, dating back to its inaugural season in 1946. The All-NBA Team originally had two teams, but since 1988 it is composed of three five-man lineups—a first, second, and third team, typically comprising a total of 15 roster spots.|$|E
5|$|The current voting format {{introduced}} in 1999 is a positional voting system, {{similar to that}} used at the Eurovision Song Contest. The <b>voting</b> <b>is</b> made up of two segments, in the first of which juries announce their votes; in the second segment the televoting result is announced. The total value of votes has usually been 2 x 473 points, which means that televotes and juries have an equal 50/50 weighing in the final result. The juries, usually 11, have represented either Swedish regions or, since 2010, countries participating in the year's Eurovision Song Contest. Each jury award 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 points to their top seven songs. After the jury voting, the televoting result is revealed by the hosts in ascending order. Between 1999 and 2011, the televoting points were fixed; the top seven songs would receive 11, 22, 44, 66, 88, 110 and 132 points. Starting in 2011, televoting points are given to each entry based on its percentage of total vote. If an entry receives 10% of the televotes it will be equivalent to 10% of 473 points, i.e. 48 points. The song with the highest number of points {{at the end of the}} <b>voting</b> <b>is</b> the winner.|$|E
50|$|The primary <b>vote</b> <b>was</b> {{counted on}} seats contested, while the two-party <b>vote</b> <b>was</b> {{estimated}} for all seats.|$|R
50|$|As their <b>votes</b> <b>were</b> a tie, {{the result}} {{went to the}} public <b>vote.</b> It <b>was</b> then {{revealed}} that the act who received the most amount of <b>votes</b> <b>was</b> Ben Price.|$|R
50|$|Charles was eliminated, and his <b>votes</b> <b>were</b> {{distributed}} as follows: Venables 123, Shuttleworth 88. 314 <b>votes</b> <b>were</b> non-transferable.|$|R
5|$|The <b>voting</b> <b>is</b> {{conducted}} {{at the end of}} the regular season by members of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association, and each individual voter ranks their top five candidates on a 10-7-5-3-1 point(s) system. Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the playoffs. The closest the voting for the Hart Trophy has ever come was in the 2001–02 season, when Jose Theodore and Jarome Iginla tied in the total voting. The tiebreaker for choosing the Hart Trophy winner in such a case is number of first-place votes: Theodore claimed it, who had 86 first-place votes to Iginla's 82.|$|E
5|$|When the General Assembly {{votes on}} {{important}} questions, {{a two-thirds majority}} of those present and <b>voting</b> <b>is</b> required. Examples of important questions include recommendations on peace and security; election of members to organs; admission, suspension, and expulsion of members; and budgetary matters. All other questions are decided by a majority vote. Each member country has one vote. Apart from approval of budgetary matters, resolutions are not binding on the members. The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters {{within the scope of}} the UN, except matters of peace and security that are under consideration by the Security Council.|$|E
5|$|During sessions, {{members may}} speak after being called {{on by the}} President. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates. Partly due {{to the need for}} translation, and the {{politics}} of consensus in the chamber, debates tend to be calmer and more polite than, say, the Westminster system. <b>Voting</b> <b>is</b> conducted primarily by a show of hands, that may be checked on request by electronic voting. Votes of MEPs are not recorded in either case, however; that only occurs when there is a roll-call ballot. This is required for the final votes on legislation and also whenever a political group or 30 MEPs request it. The number of roll-call votes has increased with time. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example, when the president is elected). All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the Official Journal of the European Union and can be accessed online. Votes usually do not follow a debate, but rather they are grouped with other due votes on specific occasions, usually at noon on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. This is because the length of the vote is unpredictable and if it continues for longer than allocated it can disrupt other debates and meetings later in the day.|$|E
50|$|Rempel was eliminated, and his <b>votes</b> <b>were</b> {{transferred}} as follows: Warren 200, Greenlay 94. 490 <b>votes</b> <b>were</b> non-transferable.|$|R

5|$|Since November 2002, by-elections {{have been}} held to fill vacancies. Two by-elections were held in 2003, one in 2004, four in 2005, one in each of 2007, 2008 and 2009, two in 2010, four in 2011, two in 2013, four in 2014, six in 2015, two in 2016 and two in 2017. <b>Voting</b> <b>is</b> by {{preferential}} voting, with peers ranking the candidates in order of preference. As many or as few preferences as desired may be indicated. To win the election, a peer must receive a majority of first preference votes. If no candidate receives such a majority, the candidate with the fewest number of first preference votes is eliminated, with each of his votes being redistributed according to the second preference marked on the ballot (see Instant-runoff voting). The process is continued until one candidate receives a majority.|$|E
5|$|The NBA All-Rookie Team is {{an annual}} National Basketball Association (NBA) honor given since the 1962–63 NBA season {{to the top}} rookies during the regular season. <b>Voting</b> <b>is</b> {{conducted}} by the NBA head coaches; who {{are not allowed to}} vote for players on their own team. The All-Rookie Team is generally composed of two five-man lineups, a first team and a second team. The players each receive two points for each first team vote and one point for each second team vote. The top five players with the highest point total make the first team, with the next five making the second team. In the case of a tie at the fifth position of either team, the roster is expanded. If the first team consists of six players due to a tie, the second team will still consist of five players with the potential for more expansion in the event of additional ties. Ties have occurred several times, most recently in 2012, when Kawhi Leonard, Iman Shumpert, and Brandon Knight tied in votes received. No respect is given to positions. For example, the first team had four forwards, and one guard in 2008, while the first team had four centers (two of which were forward-centers) and one guard in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Polling {{stations}} {{are set up}} in public buildings throughout the country; voters may only vote at their assigned polling station (according to their permanent residence), but voters deployed abroad in the armed forces, voters on Croatian-flagged ships and imprisoned voters are allowed to vote elsewhere. Other voters residing in Croatia, but traveling abroad on election day may vote at Croatian diplomatic missions. Polling {{stations are}} open from 7:00am until 7:00pm, but all voters present at the polling stations at closing time are allowed to vote. Polling stations may be closed early if all registered voters have voted. Presidential election ballots contain a list of candidates verified by the State Electoral Commission, in alphabetical order. This entails the name and PIN of each candidate, {{and the names of}} political parties endorsing the candidate (or a note that the candidate is running as an independent. The names are preceded by ordinal numbers. Parliamentary election and European Parliament election ballots contain the name of the slate {{and the name of the}} person heading the list, in addition to candidates, who is not necessarily a candidate on the particular list, but may be included as a figurehead symbolizing specific political party or a coalition putting forward the list—usually head of the party of coalition at the national level. The lists are in alphabetical order and preceded by an ordinal number. <b>Voting</b> <b>is</b> done by circling the number associated with a particular candidate. Ballots marked otherwise (but positively indicating a candidate for which a vote is cast) are also considered valid. Blank ballots and ballots on which multiple numbers are circled (or multiple candidates are otherwise indicated) are invalid. Official results are announced and published by the State Electoral Commission.|$|E
