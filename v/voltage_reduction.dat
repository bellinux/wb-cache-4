50|$|Even some {{resistive}} loads {{provide only}} short-term benefits. A {{phenomenon known as}} load diversity {{plays a role in}} <b>voltage</b> <b>reduction</b> and can counteract its effects on occasion. The concept of load diversity can most easily be explained with an example. In your neighborhood, it is unlikely that all of the homes' water heaters are on at the same time. Particularly during non-hot water usage hours (morning and evening showers), when your hot water heater is on, your neighbor's may be off. Due to the distributed and noncoincident nature of these loads, the aggregate peak can remain relatively constant. However, if the voltage is reduced to all of the resistive elements in the water heaters, the elements {{will not be able to}} heat the water as quickly. While an immediate reduction in the power demand will be recognized upon initiating <b>voltage</b> <b>reduction,</b> over time water heaters will need to be on longer to achieve the thermostat-set water temperature. Thus, more water heaters will be on at the same time. This will cause the aggregate peak to increase substantially. Therefore, with respect to thermostat controlled resistive loads the benefits of <b>voltage</b> <b>reduction</b> can be short lived, and may occasionally end up increasing the aggregate load demand.|$|E
40|$|Provide your comments. 1) Energy {{price is}} one of the most {{important}} signals produced by the electricity market. When a market is experiencing a supply shortfall such that serious emergency control actions are required, it is essential for the energy price to reflect the actual scarcity conditions that exist in the market. The current price solution in the IESO market has demonstrated that when the IESO implements serious emergency control actions (such as 5 % <b>voltage</b> <b>reductions</b> and emergency purchases), price will actually decrease, thus encouraging loads to increase demand and generators to reduce supply. This counter-intuitive price response sends the wrong message to the market and jeopardizes the reliability of electricity supply in Ontario. OPG remains concerned that this interim proposal does not adequately address the need for actual supply/demand response in the real-time market. The real-time price signal may continue to send loads the signal to consume electricity, at the same time as the IESO is implementing <b>voltage</b> <b>reductions</b> or other control actions that reduce demand. OPG supports the interim proposal that allows the price to be administered after an emergency control action, with the caveats; that this rule will be re-considered as part of...|$|R

50|$|A small motor can {{be started}} by simply {{plugging}} {{it into an}} electrical receptacle or by using a switch or circuit breaker. A larger motor requires a specialized switching unit called a motorstarter or motor contactor. When energized, a direct on line (DOL) starter immediately connects the motor terminals directly to the power supply. Reduced-voltage, star-delta or soft starters connect the motor to the power supply through a <b>voltage</b> <b>reduction</b> device and increases the applied voltage gradually or in steps. In smaller sizes a motor starter is a manually operated switch; larger motors, or those requiring remote or automatic control, use magnetic contactors.

50|$|Electric {{utilities}} {{have discovered}} that this basic principle can save utility companies, and their customers, {{a significant amount of}} money. Utilities are able to shave the peak of their power demand curves by reducing the voltage across their distribution system. When a utility reaches a point where power demand is expected to exceed supply, utilities only have two options. Either purchase power from another utility, usually at substantial prices, or reduce demand. Often utilities use load management systems to turn off customers' air conditioners, water heaters, and pool pumps to reduce demand. <b>Voltage</b> <b>reduction</b> has become another option for utilities to reduce demand - typically unbeknownst to the customer. However, only the resistive portion of the load responds to the reduction in voltage to reduce aggregate demand. Loads such as incandescent lights and heater coils will use less power as the voltage is lowered. On the other hand, induction motor loads are unaffected by the reduction in voltage, because the current simply rises to account for no change or even a slight increase in power consumption.|$|E
5000|$|Further issues, however, {{affecting}} smaller generators, arose. The {{problem was}} because the frequency had remained below 49.5 Hz {{for more than a}} few seconds, and because some generators' control settings were wrong. The current connection standard G 59/2 for embedded generation states that they must not trip (cease generating) as a result of sustained low frequency, until frequency has fallen below 47 Hz. However, a number of embedded generators are still using out of date control software that is not compliant with G59/2, as it erroneously trips them (as per the previous standard, G/59, in force when they were designed and specified) if frequency falls below 49.5 Hz for a few seconds. Because of the out of date software, another 279 MW of embedded generation tripped as a result of the low frequency whilst it was at 49.2 Hz. This was a problem as the Grid had no remaining available fast-acting generation, or demand-response, reserve margins. The frequency fell as a result to 48.792 Hz. The grid rules state that as frequency falls below 48.8 Hz, distribution network operators must enact compulsory demand control. This should start, if time permits, with <b>voltage</b> <b>reduction,</b> rapidly followed by the compulsory disconnection of, in stages, up to a final total of 60 per cent of all distribution-connected customers (a very small number of very large customers are connected directly to the supergrid; for them, other measures apply). There was no time to use <b>voltage</b> <b>reduction</b> (which keeps customers on supply, but subtly reduces their demand through reducing the voltage slightly); as a result, 546 MW of demand was automatically disconnected by distribution network operators. None of the directly supergrid-connected customers were cut off. National Grid had by now taken other measures to increase output at other generation sites (and demand had been reduced at those customer sites where the customer has volunteered for this to happen, in return for reimbursement, under demand-side response contracts with National Grid, or with their supplier). National Grid was then able to restore system frequency. The average duration of loss of supply to the 546 MW of mostly low-voltage-connected (e.g. domestic) demand affected was 20 minutes.As to communications during the incident, National Grid had time to issue a warning to all users of the supergrid, (demand control imminent), which is just one step away from its most serious warning [...] "demand disconnection warning". During these incidents, the System was at risk to further generation loss which could have resulted in parts of the network being automatically disconnected by the operation of low frequency protection to ensure frequency is maintained within mandatory limits.|$|E

These conflicting design objectives can be met if both the clock frequency and the supply voltage are dynamically controlled with respect to the ongoing application requirement.
