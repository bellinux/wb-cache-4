The operation of a 24 cm diameter plasma source with hollow cathode was investigated in the lighted-mode regime of electron current collection from 0. 1 to 7. 0 A.

The experimentally measured dimensions of the plume sheaths were then compared to those theoretically predicted using a model of a spherical double sheath. Results are consistent for currents up to approximately 1. 0 A. For currents above 1. 0 A, substantial deviations from theory occur.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years of ONR support for our {{research}} program we have mainly studied the various schemes for intense, high-brightness H- beam transport and focusing in the context of its application in space defense. Detailed theoretical studies revealed that the conventional gas focusing system is not suitable as a low-energy beam transport (LEBT) system and also that there are too many unknown parameters to model accurately the be-havior of partially charge-neutralized particle beams. We concluded that the electrostatic Squadrupole lens system will be a good choice. We have developed a large number of sim-ulation codes and also accessed into the existing codes in the accelerator community (e. g., PARMILA, SNOW- 2 D, PARMTEQ, etc.) to strengthen our analysis. During the 1992 - 93 contract period we focused our attention to the experimental activities on H- beam characterization and on the installation of a LEBT system for beam transport experiments. We have simultaneously improved our code by incorporating many practical features that we encountered during the analysis of experimental data.

Knowledge of the radiation environments is being expanded by ongoing penetration of the twin Voyager spacecraft into the heliosheath boundary region of the outer heliosphere and expected emergence within the next decade into the very local interstellar medium. The Voyager measurements are being supplemented by remote sensing from Earth orbit of energetic neutral atom emission from this boundary region by NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX). Although the Voyagers long ago passed the region of the Classical Kuiper Belt, the New Horizons spacecraft will encounter Pluto in 2015 and thereafter explore one or more KBOs, meanwhile providing updated measurements of the heliospheric radiation environment in this region. Modeling of ion transport within the heliosphere allows specification of time-integrated irradiation effects while the combination of Voyager and IBEX data supports projection of the in-situ measurements into interstellar space beyond the heliosheath. Transformation of model ion flux distributions into surface sputtering and <b>volume</b> <b>ionization</b> profiles provides a multi-layer perspective for space weathering impact on the affected icy bodies and may account for some aspects of color and compositional diversity.

The Elekta Precise linear accelerator supports an internal motorized wedge, which is a single large, physical wedge on a motorized carriage. In this study, the dosimetric performance of Elekta precise three dimensional treatment planning system (3 DTPS) is evaluated by comparing the calculated and measured doses. Methods: The calculations were performed by the 3 DTPS for symmetric as well as asymmetric fields in a source to skin distance (SSD) setup at the depth of maximum dose (d max) {{as well as at}} 5, 10, and 20 cm depths in water phantom using 60 ° motorized wedges for field sizes of 4 × 4, 10 × 10, and 20 × 20 cm 2 for 6 and 15 MV photon beams.

40|$|The Koln-Julich Lamb-shift {{polarimeter}} is used {{to measure}} the nuclear polarization of the hydrogen or deuterium beam produced with the atomic-beam source for the polarized target at the ANKE spectrometer at COSY-Julich. The precision of the earlier results had been dominated by the recombination of atoms in the ionizer. Protons or deuterons from the dissociative ionization of unpolarized recombined H- 2 or D- 2 molecules had strongly contributed to the extracted ion beam. To suppress this effect, in the new ionizer a nonevaporable getter pump of about 2000 l/s H- 2 or D- 2 pumping speed surrounds the <b>ionization</b> <b>volume.</b> It reduces the extracted current of unpolarized ions, produced from the recombined molecular gas, by a factor of about 20 compared with the earlier value, which reduces the error of the polarization measurements to about 0. 5 %. Now the H- 2 or D- 2 molecules in the <b>ionization</b> <b>volume</b> predominantly are those which are contained in the incoming beam from the atomic beam source. This allows the measurement of the fraction of unpolarized molecules in the polarized atomic H or D beam. The improvement achieved is a valuable step toward the measurement of the nuclear polarization of a gas sample, extracted from the storage cell of the polarized internal gas target for the spectrometer ANKE in the COSY-Julich storage ring with the Lamb-shift polarimeter. Furthermore, the results show that the polarization of proton or deuteron beams would be increased by the installation of such a pump around the <b>ionization</b> <b>volume</b> of atomic-beam ion sources with an electron-impact ionizer.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the impact {{ionization}} processes appearing at hypervelocity impacts of microparticles on solid surfaces. With a newly developed dust particle source, applied to the Heidelberg Dust Accelerator facility, aluminium, carbon, sodium contaminated carbon, iron and latex projectiles were shot on the micrometeorite detectors CDA and CIDA. The projectile masses cover a range of 10 ^- 18 to 10 ^- 12 kg, the projectile densities a range of 1100 - 7900 kg/m^ 3 and the impact speeds a range of 2 - 70 km/s. The resulting data show different impact ionization processes depending on the impact speeds: for low speeds (v 18 km/s) <b>volume</b> <b>ionization</b> of the target and projectile material is dominating. The charge yield in the intermediate impact speed regime shows a reduced increase due to energy consumption by melting and vaporization processes. Time-of-flight mass spectroscopy, provided by both instruments, enabled {{the investigation of the}} chemical composition of the impact plasma depending on the projectile type and on the impact speed. Alkaline ions (Na, K) dominate the mass spectra at low impact speeds. For higher impact speeds appear target ions (Rh), projectile material related ions and hydrogen ions (H). The systematics of characteristic atomic and molecular ion species in the mass spectra helps to get clues on the chemical nature of unknown projectiles in space. An improved model on specific ion yields can be given. Furthermore a lot of results which are important for the instrument calibration and the understanding of flight data, like global charge yields, rise times and sensitivities were obtained.

40|$|Purpose: The overall {{purpose of}} this study was a {{comparison}} of radiation exposure for patients and staff during intra-operative imaging for orthopedic lumbar spine surgery. In order to achieve this, we: (1) Characterized each x-ray machine for physics performance, (2) Measured occupational radiation exposure inside the surgical suite for multiple intra-operative imaging devices utilizing currently in place clinical protocols for abdominal/spinal imaging, and (3) Measured specific organ doses for a phantom of three different Body Mass Indices (BMI) for each machine. We also compared the dose changes relative to changes in BMI as well as surgical image quality changes relative to BMI. This served as the majority of the first phase of a two phase project. The purpose of the second phase of the project will be to optimize scan parameters for surgical hardware placement in terms of image quality and organ dose for the devices that allow for modifications of scanner settings. Materials and Methods: (1) X-Ray quality control meters were used to verify particular beam characteristics and additional information was calculated from the beam data. Both a small <b>volume</b> <b>ionization</b> chamber as well as Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) dosimeters were used to validate linear response of new design X-Ray tubes. (2) Both handheld ionization chamber survey meters as well as Geiger-Muller based personal dose meters were used to measure stray radiation for room surveys in locations representative of typical radiation worker positions during intra-operative imaging. (3) MOSFET dosimeters were placed in an adult male anthropomorphic phantom representing a normal BMI. 20 MOSFETs were used in nine organs with two small volume ion chambers used for skin surface dosimetry. Two additional layers of adipose equivalent material were progressively added to the phantom to represent BMI values of overweight and obese. Results: (1) The maximum tube potential, half value layer (HVL), effective energy, and soft tissue f-factor for each machine is as follows: IMRIS VISIUS iCT: 118. 4 kVp, 7. 66 mm Al, 53. 64 keV, and 0. 934 cGy/R; Mobis Airo: 122. 3 kVp, 7. 21 mm Al, 51. 31 keV, and 0. 925 cGy/R; Siemens ARCADIS Orbic 3 D: 83 kVp, 7. 12 mm Al, 32. 76 keV, and 0. 914 cGy/R; GE OEC 9900 Elite: 75 kVp, 4. 25 mm Al, 46. 6 keV, and 0. 920 cGy/R. (2) The highest exposure rates measured during clinically implemented protocols for each scanner are as follows: IMRIS VISIUS iCT: 800 mR/hr; Mobis Airo: 6. 47 R/hr; Siemens ARCADIS Orbic 3 D: 26. 4 mR/hr. (3) The effective dose per scan of each device for a full lumbar spine scan are as follows, for normal, overweight, and obese BMI, respectively: IMRIS VISIUS iCT: 12. 00 ± 0. 30 mSv, 15. 91 ± 0. 75 mSv, and 23. 23 ± 0. 55 mSv; Mobius Airo: 5. 90 ± 0. 25 mSv, 4. 97 ± 0. 12 mSv, and 3. 44 ± 0. 21 mSv; Siemens ARCADIS Orbic 3 D: 0. 30 ± 0. 03 mSv, 0. 39 ± 0. 02 mSv, and 0. 28 ± 0. 03 mSv; GE OEC 9900 Elite: 0. 44 mSv, 0. 77 mSv, and 1. 14 mSv. Conclusion: (1) The IMRIS VISIUS iCT i-Fluoro capable CT scanner and Mobius Airo mobile CT scanner have similar beam characteristics with significantly different tube parameter modulation protocols. Siemens ARCADIS Orbic 3 D and GE OEC 9900 offer comparable beam characteristics but different imaging methods. All scanners performed within factory specifications. (2) The IMRIS VISIUS iCT should not be used in i-Fluoro mode for surgical procedures active during scanning due to the 1. 42 cGy/s point dose rate in the beam field. The high exposure rate from the Mobius Airo is offset by short scan times and can be mitigated by ensuring enforcement of currently established radiation protection regulations and policies. Minimal stray radiation is measured from the Siemens ARCADIS Orbic 3 D. (3) The differences in tube modulation of the CT scanners means the Mobius Airo offers a significantly reduced effective dose with increasing patient BMI over the IMRIS VISIUS iCT. Effective dose from the CT scanners varies as much as one to two orders of magnitude higher than the C Arms, but the Siemens ARCADIS Orbic 3 D offers unusable image quality for patients with higher than normal BMI. Based off of physician reported usable surgical image quality of Mobius Airo, this device is recommended for continued integration and implementation during routine surgical procedures for patients of all BMI in orthopedic lumbar spine surgery.

These include Doppler and collision induced alignment effects, for instance, that result in a detection efficiency {{that depends on the}} angle between the post-collision velocity vector and the propagation or polarization direction of the laser. Another important and well-known member of this class is the so-called flux-to-density effect, that describes the detection probability of the scattered molecules related to the REMPI process. This probability is not equal for all scattered molecules, as REMPI probes the density of molecules at a given moment in time, whereas scattering cross sections are defined in terms of fluxes.

We have used a combination of high-resolution N-body simulations (to describe the dark matter and diffuse gas component), a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation (to track {{the evolution of the}} sources of ionizing radiation) and the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code CRASH (to follow the propagation of ionizing photons into the IGM). The process has been followed in the largest volume ever used for this kind of study, a field region of the universe with a comoving length of L~ 20 /h Mpc, embedded in a much larger cosmological simulation. To assess the effect of environment on the reionization process, the same radiative transfer simulations have been performed on a 10 /h Mpc comoving box, centered on a clustered region. We find that, to account for the all ionizing radiation, objects with total masses of M~ 10 ^ 9 Msun must be resolved. In this case, the simulated stellar population produces a <b>volume</b> averaged <b>ionization</b> fraction x_v= 0. 999 by z~ 8, consistent with observations without requiring any additional sources of ionization. We also find that environment substantially affects the reionization process. In fact, although the simulated proto-cluster occupies a smaller volume and produces a higher number of ionizing photons, it gets totally ionized later. This is because high density regions, which are more common in the proto-cluster, are difficult to ionize because of their high recombination rates.

40|$|The 21 cm {{brightness}} temperature δ T_ b fluctuations from reionization promise {{to provide information}} on the physical processes during that epoch. We present a formalism for generating the δ T_ b distribution using dark matter simulations and an one-dimensional radiative transfer code. Our analysis is able {{to account for the}} spin temperature T_ S fluctuations arising from inhomogeneous X-ray heating and Lyα coupling during cosmic dawn. The δ T_ b power spectrum amplitude at large scales (k ∼ 0. 1 Mpc^- 1) is maximum when ∼ 10 % of the gas (by volume) is heated above the CMB temperature. The power spectrum shows a "bump"-like feature during cosmic dawn and its location measures the typical sizes of heated regions. We find that the effect of peculiar velocities on the power spectrum is negligible at large scales for most part of the reionization history. During early stages (when the <b>volume</b> averaged <b>ionization</b> fraction ≲ 0. 2) this is because the signal is dominated by fluctuations in T_ S. For reionization models that are solely driven by stars within high mass (≳ 10 ^ 9 M_) haloes, the peculiar velocity effects are prominent only at smaller scales (k ≳ 0. 4 Mpc^- 1) where patchiness in the neutral hydrogen density dominates the signal.

The first is direct two-photon photoionization using only a 480 [*]nm femtosecond laser pulse, which results in short (∼ 15 ps) but hot (∼ 104 [*]K) electron bunches. The second regime is just-above-threshold femtosecond photoionization employing {{the combination of a}} continuous-wave 780 [*]nm excitation laser and a tunable 480 [*]nm femtosecond ionization laser which results in both ultracold (∼ 10 [*]K) and ultrafast (∼ 25 ps) electron bunches. These pulses typically contain ∼ 103 electrons and have a root-mean-square normalized transverse beam emittance of 1. 5 [*]±[*] 0. 1 [*]nm rad. The measured pulse lengths are limited by the energy spread associated with the longitudinal size of the <b>ionization</b> <b>volume,</b> as expected. The third regime is just-below-threshold ionization which produces Rydberg states which slowly ionize on microsecond time scales...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} a Bruker esquire 6000 {{quadrupole}} ion trap mass spectrometer, originally {{equipped with a}} typical atmospheric pressure ion (API) source design (Apollo™), was coupled to a smog chamber for in situ monitoring of degradation product formation of atmospherically relevant volatile organic compounds (VOC), in particular aromatic hydrocarbons (AH). Atmospheric Pressure Photo Ionization (APPI) and Atmospheric Pressure Laser Ionization (APLI) were used for ion generation, with the latter being sensitive and selective towards “ring-retaining” degradation products.       Comprehensive studies of the fluid dynamical behavior of the commercially available API source revealed that chaotic, turbulent flows prevailing in the source enclosure cause ion residence times exceeding one second. The conventional assembly additionally restricts the <b>ionization</b> <b>volume</b> for APLI and leads to an insufficient use of the ionizing laser radiation. Hence, the application {{of this type of}} source design was deemed inappropriate for the intended gas-phase sampling from atmospheric degradation product studies. Consequently, a novel API source design, based on a tube system, was developed. It is characterized by an essentially laminar sample gas stream, solely determined by the choked flow of the mass spectrometer capillary. This setup shows well-defined fluid dynamical behavior and high ion transmission efficiencies. For APLI applications the sample is irradiated along the downstream propagation of the sample gas flow, which entails significant increase in <b>ionization</b> <b>volume</b> and thus <b>ionization</b> efficiencies compared to common APLI assembles. As a result, the replacement of the commonly used exciplex laser as radiation source with a compact, significantly smaller, and more cost efficient diode pumped solid state laser (DPSS) became feasible. Herewith, detection limits of anthracene in the lower pptV range were obtained. For APPI applications a specially shaped lithium fluoride window was mounted onto the inlet tube assembly allowing for efficient vacuum ultra violet (VUV) irradiation perpendicular to the sample gas stream. Theoretical, experimental, as well as computational investigations in terms of the fluid dynamical behavior, ion production and ion transport characteristics of this “laminar-flow ion source (LFIS) ” are presented. This design was filed as patent application in 2009.       A considerable part of this work is concerned with the occurrence of ion transformation processes (ITP) in API-MS, in particular ITPs induced by in situ generated neutral radicals. The significant impact of ITPs on the signal ion distribution, the loss of mass spectrometric information, and the consequences for data interpretation particularly with respect to unknown compositions is demonstrated.       The impact of bi-and termolecular ITPs called for an entirely redesigned APPI approach. Herein, VUV irradiation of the sample gas stream occurs further downstream within the transfer capillary of the mass spectrometer. In this way the time between the ionization step and enter into the collision free region is reduced by a factor of 250, whereas the analyte density is only reduced by a factor of four, compared to common API assemblies. This approach required opening of the capillary. Consequently, this new stage was thoroughly characterized in terms of fluid dynamical behavior and ion transmission efficiencies. Furthermore, commercially available APPI lamps did not allow efficient irradiation of the capillary gas flow. Therefore home-built, windowless miniature argon spark discharge lamps were successfully developed. The lamps are precisely mounted on the transfer capillary and deliver VUV radiation on a small well-defined illuminated area. With this new APPI approach lower detection limits of 0. 1 ppbV for 2 -butanone and 0. 5 ppbV for benzene were obtained. A comprehensive characterization of the lamp in terms of the discharge properties and the emitted VUV radiation is presented. The result of significantly reduced ITPs and thus preservation of mass spectrometric information is demonstrated. This design was filed as patent application in 2011.       An exemplary study on p-xylene demonstrates the capabilities of this setup for in situ mass spectrometric monitoring of atmospheric degradation products...|$|R
40|$|Exploratory model {{calculations}} for the Io atomic oxygen cloud {{have provided}} two-dimensional sky-plane intensities for the 6300 A, 1304 A and 880 A lines, where <b>volume</b> excitation and <b>ionization</b> rates {{are determined by}} impact collisions with Io plasma torus electrons. Comparison of model results with observations at 6300 A suggests an isotropic oxygen flux from Io of about 1. 5 x 109 atoms 1 sq cm/sec. The effects of including a neutral sulfur cloud and also of including charge exchange reactions between plasma torus ions and neutral OI and SI were evaluated to be significant and were roughly estimated to increase the required oxygen flux to 1. 2 x 10 to the 10 th atoms/sq cm/sec. In addition, increases in the estimates for the ion loading, cloud mass loss, plasma mass loading and ion energy input rates were also made. Model calculations for an Io sulfur cloud, excluding charge exchange reactions but assuming an SI flux of 7. 5 x 10 to the 8 th atoms/sq cm/sec (i. e., half of the oxygen flux), were also performed and provided sky plane intensities {{for a number of}} visible and IR emission lines...|$|R
40|$|The gas {{sampling}} problem in satellite and high velocity probes was investigated {{by applying the}} theory of a drifting Maxwellian gas. A lens system using a free stream ion source was developed and experimentally evaluated over the pressure range of 0. 00001 to 0. 01 N/m sq (approx. 10 to the minus 7 th power to 0. 0001 torr). The source has high beam transparency, which minimizes gas-surface collisions within, or near, the <b>ionization</b> <b>volume.</b> It is shown that for high ion energy (60 eV), the extracted ion beam has an on-axis energy spread of less than 4 eV, and that 90 percent of the ions are within 2. 5 deg of the beam axis. It is concluded that the molecular beam mass spectrometer concept, developed for gas density measurements in the upper atmosphere, substantially reduces gas-surface scattering and gas-surface reactions in the sample, and preserves {{the integrity of the}} gas sample during the analysis process. Studies show that both the Scout and Delta launch vehicles have adequate volume, control, velocity, and data acquisition capability necessary to obtain thermospheric number density in real time...|$|R
40|$|A {{metastable}} atom bombardment (MAB) ionization source has been coupled to an existing thermal desorption aerosol mass spectrometer. The design allows real-time alternation between MAB and electron ionization (EI). A jet of metastable species produced in a DC discharge {{is directed at}} the <b>ionization</b> <b>volume</b> of the mass spectrometer, where Penning ionization {{is thought to be}} the dominant mechanism. Performance is characterized in experiments with oleic acid particles. By changing discharge gases between N 2, Kr, and Ar, the excited state energy of the metastable species can be adjusted in the range 8. 5 - 11. 7 eV. For vaporization at 180 oC, all gases yield significantly less fragmentation than EI, which could improve results of factor analysis. Fragmentation increases with vaporization temperature, but generated fragments have higher average mass than those produced by EI. Analyte signal levels are 0. 1 % and 0. 006 % of equivalent analysis with EI when using Ar* and Kr*, respectively. These sensitivities are not practical for ambient studies, but are sufficient for source measurements, as demonstrated with direct measurements of biomass burning emissions. The measured Ar* flux of 3. 6 x 1013 sr- 1 s- 1 is ~ 30 times lower than the best literature values for similar metastable beam sources, suggesting that sensitivity can be increased by source design improvements...|$|R
3000|$|Full {{simulations}} {{of the experiment}} are performed using Monte Carlo trajectory simulations. The use of a Stark decelerator in the experiment brings the advantage that the spatial, velocity and temporal distributions of the NO packet are extremely well known from numerical {{simulations of}} the molecular trajectories inside the decelerator. These simulations therefore precisely yield the position, velocity and time for a given NO molecule that enters the interaction region. The parameters of the Ne atom beam, on the other hand, are less well known. This beam is assumed to have a Gaussian density distribution in the direction that corresponds to the molecular beam axis of the Stark decelerator, and a homogeneous distribution in the two other orthogonal directions, i.e., the NO radicals are assumed to scatter with a laminar gas flow. This approximation is valid under our experimental conditions, as the <b>ionization</b> <b>volume</b> is {{much smaller than the}} spatial extent of both beams, and as the interaction time of both beams is limited to < 20 μs. For every NO radical that exits the Stark decelerator, the position and time at which this NO radical collides with a Ne atom is calculated from the spatial distribution of the Ne beam. The three velocity components of this Ne atom are then chosen randomly from Gaussian velocity distributions, where the longitudinal velocity and transverse angular spreads are assumed to be Δ [...]...|$|R
