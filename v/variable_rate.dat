25|$|<b>Variable</b> <b>rate</b> {{mortgages}} are {{the most}} common form of loan for house purchase in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada but are unpopular in some other countries such as Germany. <b>Variable</b> <b>rate</b> mortgages are very common in Australia and New Zealand. In some countries, true fixed-rate mortgages are not available except for shorter-term loans; in Canada, the longest term for which a mortgage rate can be fixed is typically no more than ten years, while mortgage maturities are commonly 25 years.|$|E

25|$|For {{those who}} plan to move within a {{relatively}} short period of time (three to seven years), <b>variable</b> <b>rate</b> mortgages may still be attractive because they often include a lower, fixed rate of interest for the first three, five, or seven years of the loan, after which the interest rate fluctuates.|$|E
25|$|A fictitious force (also {{called a}} pseudo force, two {{involving}} rotation: centrifugal force and Coriolis force; and a fourth, called the Euler force, {{caused by a}} <b>variable</b> <b>rate</b> of rotation, should that occur.

25|$|Interest {{rates for}} the eurozone, set by the ECB since 1999. Levels are in {{percentages}} per annum. Between June 2000 and October 2008, the main refinancing operations were <b>variable</b> <b>rate</b> tenders, as opposed to fixed rate tenders.

25|$|In {{addition}} to these mandatory taxes, as of 2007, Islamic taxes were collected on a voluntary basis. These included an individual's income tax (Arabic khums, “one-fifth”); an alms-tax (zakat), which has a <b>variable</b> <b>rate</b> and benefits charitable causes; and a land tax (kharaj), the rate of {{which is based on}} the principle of one-tenth (ushr) of the value of crops, unless the land is tax-exempt.|$|E
25|$|Locking into low fixed–rate {{long-term}} borrowing. For {{a finance}} director watching {{the trend in}} interest rates, there is an attraction in trying to catch the lowest point in the cycle to fund with fixed rate debt, or swap <b>variable</b> <b>rate</b> bank borrowings for fixed rate convertible borrowing. Even if the fixed market turns, it may still be possible for a company to borrow via a convertible carrying a lower coupon than ever {{would have been possible}} with straight debt funding.|$|E
25|$|Refinancing {{operations}} are conducted via an auction mechanism. The ECB specifies {{the amount of}} liquidity it wishes to auction (called the allotted amount) and asks banks for expressions of interest. In a fixed rate tender the ECB also specifies the interest rate at which {{it is willing to}} lend money; alternatively, in a <b>variable</b> <b>rate</b> tender the interest rate is not specified and banks bid against each other (subject to a minimum bid rate specified by the ECB) to access the available liquidity.|$|E
30|$|Wideband code {{division}} multiple access (WCDMA) cellular networks use a CDMA scheme known as OVSF-CDMA [4] to support <b>variable</b> data <b>rates</b> by employing orthogonal variable spreading factor (OVSF) codes. In an OVSF-CDMA-based system, each mobile station is assigned a single OVSF code. <b>Variable</b> data <b>rates</b> are supported by changing the spreading factor (SF). An alternative CDMA scheme known as multicode CDMA (MC-CDMA) [5] assigns multiple codes of the same spreading factor to a mobile station in order to achieve <b>variable</b> data <b>rates.</b> MC-CDMA requires multiple transceivers to support <b>variable</b> data <b>rates.</b> OVSF-CDMA reduces the hardware complexity of the mobile station because it requires only a single transceiver to support <b>variable</b> data <b>rates.</b> However, OVSF-CDMA suffers from the code blocking problem, as explained next.|$|R

3000|$|Rating Each {{range for}} each DRASTIC factor is {{evaluated}} with {{respect to each other}} to determine the relative significance of each range with respect to the impact on pollution potential. The rating for each DRASTIC factor is assigned a value between 1 and 10. These ratings provide a relative assessment between ranges in each factor. The higher the rating is the more significant on pollution potential. A and I factors assigned a ‘typical’ <b>rating</b> and a <b>variable</b> <b>rating.</b> The <b>variable</b> <b>rating</b> allows the user to choose either a typical value or to adjust the value based more specific knowledge (Aller et al. 1987).|$|R
25|$|Another GS option {{package was}} {{available}} on the Buick Wildcat and Wildcat Custom, hardtop and convertible. The GS package included a 3.42 ratio posi rear, <b>variable</b> <b>rate</b> suspension springs, quick ratio steering box, heavy duty sway bars, and a switch-pitch turbo-hydramatic 400 transmission. The addition of the Y48 option gave the purchaser a pair of Carter AFB four barrel carburators, and finned aluminum valve covers on the 425 nail head engine. This was a one-year only option, existing in 1966 only. The Y48 option was delivered in the trunk and installed by the dealer.|$|E

South Florida {{is home to a}} large number of these tolled or {{partially}} tolled roads with express lanes, the latter of which can have a <b>variable</b> <b>rate</b> that can rise to over US$1 per mile during crush loads. Highway expansion through wideing projects, the addition of express lanes, and the rebuilding of interchanges has persisted into the 2010s, though traffic congestion is as bad as ever, ranking high among United States metro areas.|$|E
25|$|A {{month after}} taking office, Campbell-Bannerman called a general election, {{in which the}} Liberals gained a {{landslide}} majority of 132. However, Asquith's first budget, in 1906, was constrained by the annual income and expenditure plans he had inherited from his predecessor Austen Chamberlain. The only income for which Chamberlain had over-budgeted was the duty from sales of alcohol. With a balanced budget, and a realistic assessment of future public expenditure, Asquith was able, in his second and third budgets, to lay the foundations for limited redistribution of wealth and welfare provisions for the poor. Blocked at first by Treasury officials from setting a <b>variable</b> <b>rate</b> of income tax with higher rates on those with high incomes, {{he set up a}} committee under Sir Charles Dilke which recommended not only variable income tax rates but also a super-tax on incomes of more than £5,000 a year. Asquith also introduced a distinction between earned and unearned income, taxing the latter at a higher rate. He used the increased revenues to fund old-age pensions, the first time a British government had provided them. Reductions in selective taxes, such as that on sugar, were aimed at benefiting the poor.|$|E

2500|$|Note {{that the}} {{assumption}} of a strict molecular clock is often unrealistic, especially across long periods of evolution. For example, even though rodents are genetically very similar to primates, they have undergone a much higher number of substitutions in the estimated time since divergence in some regions of the genome. This {{could be due to}} their shorter generation time, higher metabolic rate, increased population structuring, increased rate of speciation, or smaller body size. When studying ancient events like the Cambrian explosion under a molecular clock assumption, poor concurrence between cladistic and phylogenetic data is often observed.

We argue that <b>variable</b> capital-utilization <b>rates</b> are a quantitatively important source of propagation to business-cycle shocks. With this additional source of propagation, the volatility of exogenous technology shocks needed to explain the observed variability in aggregate U.
