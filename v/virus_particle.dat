5|$|Antibodies can {{continue}} {{to be an effective}} defence mechanism even after viruses have managed to gain entry to the host cell. A protein that is in cells, called TRIM21, can attach to the antibodies {{on the surface of the}} <b>virus</b> <b>particle.</b> This primes the subsequent destruction of the virus by the enzymes of the cell's proteosome system.|$|E
5|$|There are six viral {{proteins}} (VPs) {{that form}} the <b>virus</b> <b>particle</b> (virion). These structural proteins are called VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, VP6 and VP7.

The present work describes a new method by which adsorbed <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> can be removed from human erythrocytes, allowing quantitative determination {{of the number of}} <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> which can bind and fuse with human erythrocyte membranes. Through the use of 125 I-labeled Sendai <b>virus</b> <b>particles,</b> it is shown that incubation with 50 mM dithiothreitol removed about 90 to 95 % of adsorbed <b>virus</b> <b>particles.</b> Fused <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> were resistant to treatment with dithiothreitol. Negligible amounts of 125 I-labeled Sendai <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> were removed by treatment with dithiothreitol after incubation of virus-cell complexes at 37 degrees C. Trypsinized <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> were able to attach to, but not fuse with, human erythrocytes even after prolonged incubation at 37 degrees C. Treatment with dithiothreitol removed as much as 80 to 85 % of trypsinized <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> incubated with human erythrocytes at 37 degrees C. A quantitative determination revealed that about 1, 000 to 1, 200 and 600 to 800 Sendai <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> can bind to or fuse with human erythrocytes, respectively...|$|R

5|$|Viruses {{reproduce}} rapidly {{because they}} {{have only a few}} genes compared to humans who have 20,000–25,000. For example, influenza virus has only eight genes and rotavirus has eleven. These genes encode structural proteins that form the <b>virus</b> <b>particle,</b> or non-structural proteins, that are only found in cells infected by the virus.|$|E
5|$|A <b>virus</b> <b>particle,</b> {{also known}} as a virion, {{consists}} of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a capsid. The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers can either be icosahedral (20-sided), helical or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of lipid (fat) called an envelope.|$|E
5|$|Like DNA, RNA {{can carry}} genetic information. RNA viruses have genomes {{composed}} of RNA that encodes {{a number of}} proteins. The viral genome is replicated by some of those proteins, while other proteins protect the genome as the <b>virus</b> <b>particle</b> moves to a new host cell. Viroids are another group of pathogens, but they consist only of RNA, do not encode any protein and are replicated by a host plant cell's polymerase.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHuman {{immunodeficiency}} virus type- 1 (HIV- 1) Vpr is a virion-associated protein implicated {{to have a}} role in AIDS pathogenesis. In regard to the amount of Vpr incorporated into <b>virus</b> <b>particles,</b> the published data vary widely. To address this, we quantitated Vpr in <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> derived from diverse sources that are used to evaluate the biological effect of Vpr. <b>Virus</b> <b>particles</b> from infected cells showed only a small amount of Vpr. Interestingly, <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> from cells cotransfected with HIV- 1 proviral DNA lacking Vpr coding sequences (NLΔVpr) and a Vpr expression plasmid showed a drastic increase (29. 4 -fold) in the incorporation of Vpr. Furthermore, cotransfection involving NLΔVpr and different concentrations of Vpr expression plasmid resulted in <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> containing Vpr in proportion to the Vpr expression plasmid used. The differences in <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> with respect to Vpr as revealed by these studies should be taken into account in assessing the effect of Vpr...|$|R
40|$|The {{protease}} inhibitor leupeptin {{was shown to}} inhibit retrovirus infection in mouse fibroblasts at a step shortly after internalization of the <b>virus</b> <b>particles.</b> The inhibited step most likely was the passage of <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> through the lysosomes or other acid vesicles.

5|$|The {{range of}} {{structural}} and biochemical effects that viruses {{have on the}} host cell is extensive. These are called cytopathic effects. Most virus infections eventually result {{in the death of}} the host cell. The causes of death include cell lysis, alterations to the cell's surface membrane and apoptosis. Often cell death is caused by cessation of its normal activities because of suppression by virus-specific proteins, not all of which are components of the <b>virus</b> <b>particle.</b>|$|E
5|$|This is, in turn, {{surrounded}} by the viral envelope, that is composed of the lipid bilayer taken from the membrane of a human cell when the newly formed <b>virus</b> <b>particle</b> buds from the cell. The viral envelope contains proteins from the host cell and relatively few copies of the HIV Envelope protein, which consists of a cap made of three molecules known as glycoprotein (gp) 120, and a stem consisting of three gp41 molecules which anchor the structure into the viral envelope. The Envelope protein, encoded by the HIV env gene, allows the virus to attach to target cells and fuse the viral envelope with the target cell membrane releasing the viral contents into the cell and initiating the infectious cycle.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{a member}} of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and {{biological}} properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the <b>virus</b> <b>particle.</b> The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.|$|E

25|$|Like {{protease}} inhibitors, bevirimat {{and other}} maturation inhibitors interfere with protease processing of newly translated HIV polyprotein precursor, called gag. Gag {{is an essential}} structural protein of the HIV virus. Gag undergoes a chain of interactions both with itself and with other cellular and viral factors to accomplish the assembly of infectious virus particles. HIV assembly is a two-stage process involving an intermediate immature capsid that undergoes a structurally dramatic maturation to yield the infectious particle. This alteration is mediated by the viral protease, which cleaves the Gag polyprotein precursor, allowing the freed parts to reassemble to form {{the core of the}} mature <b>virus</b> <b>particle.</b> Bevirimat prevents this viral replication by specifically inhibiting cleavage of the capsid protein (CA) from the SP1 spacer protein. First, bevirimat enters a growing <b>virus</b> <b>particle</b> as it buds from an infected cell and binds to the Gag polypeptide at the CA/SP1 cleavage site. This prevents the protease enzyme from cleaving CA-SP1. As the capsid protein remains bound to SP1, the <b>virus</b> <b>particle</b> core is prevented from compressing into its normal mature shape, which is crucial for infectivity, resulting in the release of an immature, non-infectious particle.|$|E
40|$|SummaryPrior {{to being}} {{released}} from the infected cell, intracellular enveloped vaccinia <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> are transported from their perinuclear assembly site to the plasma membrane along microtubules by the motor kinesin- 1. After fusion with the plasma membrane, stimulation of actin tails beneath extracellular <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> acts to enhance cell-to-cell virus spread. However, we lack molecular understanding of events that occur at the cell periphery just {{before and during the}} liberation of <b>virus</b> <b>particles.</b> Using live cell imaging, we show that <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> move in the cell cortex, independently of actin tail formation. These cortical movements and the subsequent release of <b>virus</b> <b>particles,</b> which are both actin dependent, require F 11 L-mediated inhibition of RhoA-mDia signaling. We suggest that the exit of vaccinia virus from infected cells has strong parallels to exocytosis, as it is dependent on the assembly and organization of actin in the cell cortex...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with histological and electronmicroscopic studies on a spontaneous mammary carcinoma of AKR mice which {{are known to be}} high leukemic and low cancer strain. Followings are the conclusions obtained. 1) The spontaneous mammary carcinoma was type B adenocarcinoma according to Dunn's classification. The histology was similar to those frequently observed in mammary carcinoma of high cancer strain of mice such as C(3) H, RIII, and DBA mice. Electronmicroscopic studies revealed many type A <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> around the cytoplasmic vacuoles or free in the cytoplasm, and numerous type B <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> In the acinar spaces. In addition, a few type B <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> were observed in the cytoplasmic vacuoles and in the intercellular spaces. Morphology, distribution, and formation process of these <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> were similar to those observed in mammary carcinoma of high cancer strain of mice and some of low cancer strain of mice. These results indicate that there exist "milk factor" in low cancer strain of mice as well as in high cancer strain of mice and that the factor can induce mammary carcinoma even in low cancer strain of mice when hormonal and other environmental factors are abequate. 2) Serial electronmicroscopic observations of the original and serially transplanted mammary carcinoma of AKR mice disclosed a gradual decrease in numbers and only a few immature type B <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> were observed after the 21 st generation. These findings were ascribed to the sarcomatous transformation and loss of acinar spaces observed during the serial transplantation of the original mammary carcinoma [...] 3) The original mammary carcinoma of AKR mice harbored numerous type A and type B <b>virus</b> <b>particles.</b> Type C particles, however, were hardly observed. In tissue culture cells derived from the tumor, in contrast, numerous type C <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> were observed and type B <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> were hardly found. These findings were considered to suggest that there is an interference between type B and type C <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> in AKR mice...|$|R

More recently, however, Warrington et al. showed VP2 to be unnecessary for the complete <b>virus</b> <b>particle</b> formation and an efficient infectivity, and also presented that VP2 can tolerate large insertions in its N terminus, while VP1 can not, probably because of the PLA2 domain presence.|$|E
