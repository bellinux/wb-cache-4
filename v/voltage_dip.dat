50|$|In {{electric}} power systems, low-voltage ride through (LVRT), or fault ride through (FRT), sometimes under-voltage ride through (UVRT), is {{the capability of}} electric generators to stay connected in short periods of lower electric network voltage (cf. <b>voltage</b> <b>dip).</b> It is needed at distribution level (wind parks, PV systems, distributed cogeneration, etc.) to prevent a short circuit at HV or EHV level from causing a widespread loss of generation.

50|$|An active crowbar is {{a crowbar}} that can remove the short circuit when the {{transient}} is over thus allowing {{the device to}} resume normal operation. Active crowbars use a transistor, gate turn off (GTO) thyristor or forced commutated thyristor instead of a thyristor to short the circuit. Active crowbars are commonly used to protect the frequency converter in the rotor circuit of doubly fed generators against high voltage and current transients caused by the voltage dips in the power network. Thus the generator can ride through the fault and quickly continue the operation even during the <b>voltage</b> <b>dip.</b>|$|E
50|$|The crowbar will {{short-circuit}} {{the rotor}} windings {{through a small}} resistance when excessive currents or voltages are detected. In {{order to be able}} to continue the operation as quickly as possible an active crowbar has to be used. The active crowbar can remove the rotor short in a controlled way and thus the rotor side converter can be started only after 20-60 ms from the start of the grid disturbance when the remaining voltage stays above 15% of the nominal voltage. Thus it is possible to generate reactive current to the grid during the rest of the <b>voltage</b> <b>dip</b> and in this way help the grid to recover from the fault. For zero voltage ride through it is common to wait until the dip ends because with zero voltage it is not possible to know the phase angle where the reactive current should be injected.|$|E
50|$|To {{decouple}} other subcircuits {{from the}} effect of the sudden current demand, a decoupling capacitor can be placed between the supply voltage line and its reference (ground) next to the switched load. While the load is switched out, the capacitor charges up to full power supply voltage and otherwise does nothing. When the load is applied, the capacitor initially supplies demanded current. Ideally, by the time the capacitor runs out of charge, the power supply line inductance is saturated, and the load can draw full current at normal voltage from the power supply (and the capacitor can recharge too). Note that the <b>voltage</b> <b>dip</b> is reduced but not eliminated; i.e., the decoupling is not perfect and sometimes parallel combinations of caps are used to improve response. The best way to reduce switching noise is to design a PCB as a giant capacitor by sandwiching the power and ground planes across a dielectric material.|$|E

40|$|Voltage Source Converters (VSCs) {{are known}} to be {{sensitive}} to voltage disturbances, e. g. <b>voltage</b> <b>dips.</b> As a result of the drop in voltage, they can trip due to overcurrent or, in case of unbalanced dips, also because of fluctuations of the DC link voltage. As the amount of distributed generation with power electronic interface in the grid grows, it becomes unacceptable to loose generating units every time a disturbance occurs. Keeping the VSC on line during unbalanced <b>voltage</b> <b>dips</b> becomes thus a very critical issue. The necessary increase in VSC rating to ride through dips can be obtained if the currents do not increase much during the fault, and also a smaller DC link capacitor can be used if the DC link voltage can be kept close to its reference during faults. To accomplish this, the VSC controller must ensure robust current control and DC link voltage regulation. An option is to use a Dual Vector Current Controller (DVCC) with two separate current controllers for positive and negative sequence components.
