25|$|A {{filing cabinet}} {{is a piece}} of office {{furniture}} usually used to store paper documents in file folders. In the most simple sense, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. A <b>vertical</b> <b>file</b> cabinet has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15inches) of the cabinet. The vertical filing cabinet was invented by Edwin G. Seibels in 1898, thus revolutionizing efficient record-keeping and archiving by creating space for offices, schools, and businesses.|$|E
