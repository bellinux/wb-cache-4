We develop an efficient algorithm named PPFP-growth (Productive Periodic-Frequent Pattern-growth) to discover all productive-associated periodic frequent patterns using these measures. PPFP-growth is efficient and the productiveness measure removes uncorrelated periodic items. An experimental evaluation on synthetic and real datasets shows the efficiency of the proposed PPFP-growth algorithm, which can filter a huge number of periodic patterns to reveal only the correlated ones...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Data {{recorded}} {{from the}} devices {{used to monitor}} a patient’s <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> are often used {{in the development of}} displays, alarms, and information systems, but high-resolution, multiple-parameter datasets of anesthesia monitoring data from patients during anesthesia are often difficult to obtain. Existing databases have typically been collected from patients in intensive care units. However, the physical state of intensive care patients is dissimilar to those undergoing surgery, more frequent and marked changes to cardiovascular and respiratory variables are seen in operating room patients, and additional and highly relevant information to anesthesia (e. g., end-tidal agent monitoring, etc.) is omitted from these intensive care databases. We collected a set of high-quality, high-resolution, multiple-parameter monitoring data suitable for anesthesia monitoring research. METHODS: <b>Vital</b> <b>signs</b> <b>data</b> were recorded from patients undergoing anesthesia at the Royal Adelaide Hospital.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} {{and relatively}} rapid removal of fluid in haemodialysis patients is {{often accompanied by}} intradialytic hypotension (IDH). Current patient monitoring during haemodialysis includes intermittent measurements of tympanic temperature, blood pressure and haematocrit. However, this information is mostly used retrospectively {{rather than as a}} means for preventing adverse events. We suggest the use of a probabilistic data fusion model based on dialysis <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> <b>data</b> to predict IDH. We continuously monitored the vital signs of 40 haemodialysis patients during 8 sessions over a 6 -month period in the Oxford Renal Unit. The study involved non-invasively monitoring the heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as the tympanic temperature throughout each dialysis session. The 4 -dimensional <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> <b>data</b> was initially visualised on 2 D projections using the Neuroscale algorithm. The projections show a distinction between data from unstable and stable patients, with data from hypotensive events appearing outside the region of the 2 D projection corresponding to "normal" physiology. A data fusion model based on an estimate of the probability density function of data from stable patients was then created. With this model, instabilities in patient physiology can be identified, and the adverse event can be predicted ahead of time in some cases...|$|E

40|$|Recently, Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) has {{witnessed}} significant attentions {{in research and}} product development due to {{the growing number of}} sensor-based applications in healthcare domain. Design of efficient and effective Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is one of the fundamental research themes in WBAN. Static on-demand slot allocation to patient data is the main approach adopted in the design of MAC protocol in literature, without considering the type of patient data specifically the level of severity on patient data. This leads to the degradation of the performance of MAC protocols considering effectiveness and traffic adjustability in realistic medical environments. In this context, this paper proposes a Traffic Priority-Aware MAC (TraPy-MAC) protocol for WBAN. It classifies patient data into emergency and non-emergency categories based on the severity of patient data. The threshold value aided classification considers a number of parameters including type of sensor, body placement location, and data transmission time for allocating dedicated slots patient data. Emergency data are not required to carry out contention and slots are allocated by giving the due importance to threshold value of <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> <b>data.</b> The contention for slots is made efficient in case of non-emergency data considering threshold value in slot allocation. Moreover, the slot allocation to emergency and non-emergency data are performed parallel resulting in performance gain in channel assignment. Two algorithms namely, Detection of Severity on <b>Vital</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>data</b> (DSVS), and ETS Slots allocation based on the Severity on Vital Sign (ETS-SVS) are developed for calculating threshold value and resolving the conflicts of channel assignment, respectively. Simulations are performed in ns 2 and results are compared with the state-of-the-art MAC techniques. Analysis of results attests the benefit of TraPy-MAC in comparison with the state-of-the-art MAC in channel assignment in realistic medical environments...|$|E
