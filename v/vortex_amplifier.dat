40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effects of}} changes to the {{geometry}} of a <b>vortex</b> <b>amplifier</b> are investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, in the context of glovebox operations for the nuclear industry. These investigations were required because of anomalous behavior identified when, for operational reasons, a long-established <b>vortex</b> <b>amplifier</b> design was reduced in scale. The aims were (i) to simulate both the anomalous back-flow into the glovebox through the <b>vortex</b> <b>amplifier</b> supply ports, and the precessing vortex core in the amplifier outlet, then (ii) to determine which of the various simulated geometries would best alleviate the supply port back-flow anomaly. Various changes to the geometry of the <b>vortex</b> <b>amplifier</b> were proposed; smoke and air tests were then used to identify a subset of these geometries for subsequent simulation using CFD techniques. Having verified the mesh resolution was sufficient to reproduce the required effects, the code was then validated by comparing the results of the steady-state simulations with the experimental data. The problem is challenging in terms of the range of geometrical and dynamic scales encountered, with consequent impact on mesh quality and turbulence modeling. The anomalous nonaxisymmetric reverse flow in the supply ports of the <b>vortex</b> <b>amplifier</b> has been captured and the mixing in both the chamber and the precessing vortex core has also been successfully reproduced. Finally, by simulating changes to the supply ports that could not be reproduced experimentally at an equivalent cost, the geometry most likely to alleviate the back-flow anomaly has been identified...|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} of exhaust brake {{is very important}} for the design of the automotive diesel engine. This device is ordinary used in case of going downhill, but we try to use it in case of going level road as a sub-brake. In such a case, it is required that this device is durable. Then we examined a new type of braking system with a <b>vortex</b> <b>amplifier</b> instead of a butterfly valve in ordinary braking system. The system has no moving parts and it is durable. 　In this paper we deals with theoretically the new type braking system with <b>vortex</b> <b>amplifier</b> and verifies the theory and the usefulness of the braking system by experiments using a model braking system...|$|E
40|$|Spark {{ignition}} {{engines are}} {{a significant source of}} air pollution. Emissions are most severe in the period after the engine has been started from cold. This is because fuel enrichment is needed to ensure reliable combustion in the cold cylinder. The problem is compounded by the exhaust treatment catalyst not reaching operating temperature until some minutes after starting. As the majority of car usage is for short journeys, engines spend much of their time in this high emission operating regime. One route to reducing emissions is to improve mixture preparation. This is Particularly effective after a cold start as less enrichment is required to ensure combustion. The aim of this project has been to evaluate a Vortex'Amplifier as a route to improving mixture preparation. The <b>vortex</b> <b>amplifier</b> is a no moving parts fluidic control device. It regulates a large volume supply flow by imparting swirl to it with a small volume control flow. The control flow vortex creates a region of highly turbulent flow at the device outlet which possesses the potential to atomise a fuel spray. The VA has been tested experimentally. The sprays produced by the <b>vortex</b> <b>amplifier</b> were measured by a laser diffraction technique. Numerical analysis has also been undertaken to determine the motion of droplets within the vortex chamber and the potential of the flow to disrupt a fuel spray. The <b>vortex</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{has been found to be}} a highly effective atomiser. It produces sprays with a Sauter mean diameter approximately half the size of the best current technology. However the spray impacts on the walls of any pipework downstream of the VA due to the high tangential velocities in the flow exiting the VA. This problem currently precludes engine us'e, but suggestions for improving the situation are contained in the recommendations for future work...|$|E

40|$|Operation of gloveboxes {{containing}} radiological hazards {{relies on}} risks being broadly acceptable. The operator's protection is maintained {{in the event}} of damage to the containment wall or gloves by <b>Vortex</b> <b>Amplifiers</b> (VA's). The VA is a hybrid of the vortex diode and the proportional beam deflection amplifier; two fluidic devices relying on fluid momentum (rather than internal moving parts) to control flow. Further, environmental and fire protection is afforded by inerting the internal glovebox atmosphere utilising Nitrogen or Argon as a constant purging medium. Over the years, ergonomic restrictions have driven VA development towards geometrically scaled-down versions of previously accepted designs. Performance of the new so called mini-VA units was found to be disappointing; investigation of high Oxygen concentrations within gloveboxes identified the mini-VA as being the source. Study of the mini-VA behaviour using smoke visualisation techniques reported here has shown a potential mechanism for leakage from the device control ports into the glovebox. In order to mitigate the leakage and ensure that gloveboxes remain inert and moisture free, increased purging flows are required. The increase in cost of Nitrogen to BNFL is estimated to be in the region of £ 1 000, 000 per year on one plant alone. Very little has been published in respect to back diffusion from VA's or the flow phenomena that cause it. The following work is an experimental and numerical investigation of the physics and characteristic behaviour of mini-V A's, resulting {{in the development of a}} potential retrofit mini-VA solution capable of reducing Oxygen leakage by up to 78...|$|R
40|$|Ventilation {{systems for}} a nuclear plant must {{have a very high}} {{reliability}} and effectiveness. In this application, fluidic devices have advantages which electro-mechanical and pneumatic devices lack. Fluidic devices will not easily wear out, they have a relatively fast response and in some cases they may be cheaper than an equivalent conventional device. Most importantly, they have fewer moving parts (usually none) so are inherently reliable, so long as the fluidic design is effective. So <b>vortex</b> <b>amplifiers</b> (VXA) are ideal for active ventilation systems where access for maintenance is problematic. From 1995 to 2000, space limitations at Sellafield drove the desire to minimise VXA size and also glovebox size. Recently completed plant expansions use a smaller version of VXA produced by scaling geometrically the existing standard model. It is called the mini-VXA. Subsequent performance of the mini-VXA has been disappointing with high oxygen levels noted in the inerted gloveboxes; this required an expensive increase in the inert gas supply rate of gloveboxes to mitigate against fire risk. After doing experiments using a mini-VXA and typical glovebox, the author has confirmed the high 02 levels. The 02 distribution in the glovebox indicates that oxygen is entering the glovebox by the VXA supply ports; against the general direction of flow. The ultimate source of this back leakage is the control port (that is open to atmosphere) and smoke visualisation studies on the mock VXA indicate a mechanism. This is due to separated flow patterns with excessive control port momentum. A temporary solution using an orifice plate and spacing chamber has been shown to reduce essential nitrogen supply to one quarter that without the modification. Addition of the orifice plates enables further reduction in nitrogen use, and the smallest orifice tested performs best with no discernable cost in pressure drop and therefore fan power. The author also found the following points. The ratio of control port area to supply port area is a critical parameter affecting mixing of the two airstreams. Yet exit port area is unimportant. The ratio of supply port area to exit port area has no influence on discharge coefficient (at least within the scope of current work). It is also identified that the ratio of chamber height to exit port radius does not affect the discharge coefficient or two angle parameters. Doubling chamber height, supply port area and control port area at the same time has a slight effect on the discharge coefficient (attributed partly to a viscous effect), but no effect on the two angle parameters. The chamber height has little effect on Reynolds number. If the supply port area is not too small relative to the exit port, the supply port area will not significantly affect Reynolds number. The use of discharge coefficient and the two angle parameters to characterize VXA performance breaks with the traditional form of dimensionless characteristics that are used for the purpose. Testing these alternate characteristics has enabled the momentum (which dominates control of VXA performance) to be more explicitly expressed in updated design rules...|$|R

40|$|The {{trajectory}} {{and reach}} of jets issuing from tangential control ports at {{the periphery of}} a vortex amplifier’s swirl chamber depend largely on design geometry, size and pressures applied. Excessive control port pressure causes these jets to extend too far {{across the face of}} the radial supply ports, to impact on the opposing supply port wall whereupon, they bifurcate to create back diffusion of control port flow along the supply port channels. Flow through <b>vortex</b> <b>amplifier</b> geometry is simulated using a baseline Reynolds stress turbulence model with CFX automatic wall treatment. Anisotropic stress and vortex stretching in the swirl chamber and outlet have not prevented convergence (based on normalised <b>vortex</b> <b>amplifier</b> residuals). Known flow structures are reproduced. This paper is focussed on simulation close to pressures needed for bifurcation. Just before the point on an operating characteristic at which bifurcated tangential flow appears, the recirculation zone crossing most of the radial supply stretches to intermittently cut off the radial flow. The steady state results indicate asymmetry between the four ports, as smoke visualisation tests also imply. The transient results are sufficient to demonstrate time-dependent structures and suggest periodicity of flow structures. The model can be used to inform design and operability studies. Moreover, a curious near-wall structure of spinning flow not previously reported has been predicted close to the axis and hugging the swirl chamber wall opposite the outlet, at radii within the forced part of the Rankine vortex...|$|E

Worker protection is maintained {{in the event}} of damage to the containment wall or gloves by a <b>vortex</b> <b>amplifier</b> (VXA). The most recent gloveboxes to be made active at the Sellafield site are protected by a ‘Mini-VXA’, which is a geometrically scaled down version of the previous standard version. This article describes the assembly that incorporates the mini-VXA. It traces the major innovations in VXA system technology that have been employed on alpha gloveboxes at Sellafield since 1970, culminating in the discovery of high levels of O 2 in gloveboxes protected by the mini-VXA during commissioning of same. Laboratory tests and field trials are reported that were aimed at overcoming the unexpectedly high demand of the mini-VXA for inert gas; and the solution eventually adopted...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{two-stage}} shear-modulated hydraulic <b>vortex</b> <b>amplifier</b> (U. S. patent 3, 520, 317) {{has been}} fabricated and put through preliminary steady-state testing at the 1000 psi supply pressure level with flows up to 15 gpm. The invention comprises a conventional fluidic vortex power stage and a shear-modulated pilot stage. In {{the absence of}} any mechanical moving parts, water may be used as the hydraulic medium thus opening the way to many underseas applications. At blocked load, a control input from 0 to 150 psi was required to achieve an output from 0 to 900 psi; at wide-open load, a control input of 0 to 120 psi was needed to achieve an output from 0 to 15 gpm. The power stage has been found unsuitable for the proportional control mode because of its nonlinear performance in the intermediate load range and because of strong pressure fluctuations (plus or minus 150 psi) in the intermediate control range. The addition of the shear-modulated pilot stage improves intermediate load linearity...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{analytical}} model for predicting {{the characteristics of}} low aspect ratio, symmetrical, radial vortex amplifiers, operating with Newtonian fluids and having turbulent flow within the chamber has been modified to treat the corresponding non-Newtonian case. Comparison of the predicted results with the experimental {{results of this study}} show that the model attains some measure of success, over a limited range of power law index, but fails to properly represent the shape of the characteristic curve. In addition, the influence of the degree of pseudoplasticity of the operating fluid on <b>vortex</b> <b>amplifier</b> characteristics has been experimentally investigated. The experimental conditions included both symmetrical and asymmetrical triodes, conical and cylindrical receivers, discharge directly to atmosphere and also from a submerged exit. Five concentrations of Separan AP- 30 were used, covering a wide range of pseudoplasticity for this solution. The effects of these combinations have been established.

40|$|The {{influence}} of control port geometry on swirl development, operating characteristics, global flow and momentum characteristics is studied experimentally. Shape {{and size of}} the control flow channels and the pressure applied at the tangential ports are critical in determining the trajectory of the jet issuing from the tangential ports; and deflection of radial flow, vortex strength and prevention of back diffusion along the radial supply ports. Dominance of control-to-exit area ratio is confirmed but a clear improvement in performance is noted for the practical site-based geometry that is not derived from this ratio, but from the shaped passages of the device. Flow and momentum characteristics provide additional design data. Lack of {{influence of}} supply-to-exit area ratio is demonstrated at lower ratios than advertised in literature. The relationship of Swirl number to output flow is demonstrated. The results imply a geometrical development that has led to practical improvements in <b>vortex</b> <b>amplifier</b> geometry on the scale of the mini-VA. Global flow and momentum characteristics provide insight into design and operation that is useful when avoiding back-diffusion in a mini-VA...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques {{have been used to}} investigate the effect of changes to the geometry of a <b>vortex</b> <b>amplifier</b> (VXA) in the context of glovebox operations in the nuclear industry. These investigations were required because of anomalous behavior identified when, for operational reasons, a long-established VXA design was reduced in scale. The study simulates the transient aspects of two effects: back-flow into the glovebox through the VXA supply ports, and the precessing vortex core in the amplifier outlet. A temporal convergence error study indicates that there is little to be gained from reducing the time step duration below 0. 1 ms. Based upon this criterion, the results of the simulation show that the percentage imbalance in the domain was well below the required figure of 1 %, and imbalances for momentum in all three axes were all below measurable values. Furthermore, there was no conclusive evidence of periodicity in the flow perturbations at the glovebox boundary, although good evidence of periodicity in the device itself and in the outlet pipe was seen. Under all conditions the modified geometry performed better than the control geometry with regard to aggregate reversed supply flow. The control geometry exhibited aggregate nonaxisymmetric supply port back-flow for almost all of the simulated period, unlike the alternative geometry for which the flow through the supply ports was positive, although still nonaxisymmetric, for most of the period. The simulations show how transient flow structures in the supply ports can cause flow to be reversed in individual ports, whereas aggregate flow through the device remains positive. Similar to the supply ports, flow through the outlet of the VXA under high swirl conditions is also nonaxisymmetric. A time-dependent reverse flow region was observed in both the outlet and the diffuser. It is possible that small vortices in the outlet, coupled with the larger vortex in the chamber, are responsible for the oscillations, which cause the shift in the axis of the precessing vortex core (and ultimately in the variations of mass flow in the individual supply ports). Field trials show that the modified geometry reduces the back-flow of oxygen into the glovebox by as much as 78 %. At purge rates of 0. 65 m 3 /h the modified geometry was found to be less effective, the rate of leakage from the VXA increasing by 16 – 20 %. Despite this reduced performance, leakage from the modified geometry was still 63 % less than the control geometry...|$|E
