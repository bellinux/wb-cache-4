40|$|The {{driving force}} for the {{semiconductor}} industry growth has been the elegant scaling nature of CMOS technology. In future CMOS technology generations, supply and threshold voltages will have to continually scale to sustain performance increase, limit energy consumption, control power dissipation, and maintain reliability. These continual scaling requirements on supply and threshold voltages pose several technology and circuit design challenges. One such challenge is the expected increase in threshold <b>voltage</b> <b>variation</b> due to worsening short channel effect. This thesis will address three specific circuit design challenges arising from increased threshold <b>voltage</b> <b>variation</b> and present prospective solutions.

5000|$|The ECL {{circuits}} usually {{operate with}} negative power supplies (positive {{end of the}} supply is connected to ground) in contrast to other logic families in which negative end of the supply is grounded. This is done mainly to minimize {{the influence of the}} power supply variations on the logic levels as ECL is more sensitive to noise on the VCC and relatively immune to noise on VEE. Because ground should be the most stable voltage in a system, ECL is specified with a positive ground. In this connection, when the supply voltage varies, the voltage drops across the collector resistors change slightly (in the case of emitter constant current source, they do not change at all). As the collector resistors are firmly [...] "tied up" [...] to ground, the output voltages [...] "move" [...] slightly (or not at all). If the negative end of the power supply was grounded, the collector resistors would be attached to the positive rail. As the constant voltage drops across the collector resistors change slightly (or not at all), the output voltages follow the supply <b>voltage</b> <b>variations</b> and the two circuit parts act as constant current level shifters. In this case, the voltage divider R1-R2 compensates the <b>voltage</b> <b>variations</b> to some extent. The positive power supply has another disadvantage - the output voltages will vary slightly (±0.4 V) against the background of high constant voltage (+3.9 V). Another reason for using a negative power supply is protection of the output transistors from an accidental short circuit developing between output and ground (but the outputs are not protected from a short circuit with the negative rail).|$|E
