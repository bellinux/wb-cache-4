50|$|Onslow's speakership was {{distinguished}} by his great integrity in a corrupt and jobbing age. His great achievement as Speaker was to assert the independence, authority, and impartiality of that post. While {{he continued to}} participate in ordinary political activity, speaking and <b>voting</b> <b>in</b> <b>committee,</b> he {{did not hesitate to}} oppose Government policy when necessary. Onslow saw his role to be the protection and defence of Parliament in the tradition established by the Glorious Revolution. He insisted on rigidly observing parliamentary forms and procedure, which he viewed as a protection to independent MPs. But his devotion to precedent led him to condemn the reporting of parliamentary debates as breach of privilege.|$|E

50|$|In {{his first}} {{legislative}} session, Ponti <b>voted</b> <b>in</b> <b>committee</b> {{to send a}} proposed legislative pay raise to the House floor. He then <b>voted</b> <b>in</b> the full chamber against the measure, known as SB 672, which nevertheless passed the House 56-45 on June 13, 2008. Amid a large public protest, Governor Bobby Jindal vetoed the legislation, which would have tripled state legislators' salaries.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), {{along with}} the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico and the delegates from Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa, {{received}} a limited <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> the <b>Committee</b> of the Whole, based on their right to <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> legislative <b>committees.</b> However, this limited vote stipulated {{if any of the}} delegates provided the deciding vote on an issue considered by the Committee of the Whole, a new vote would be conducted and the delegates {{would not be allowed to}} vote. The right of delegates to <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>Committee</b> of the Whole was removed by the Republican majority in 1995 after that party gained control of Congress in the 1994 congressional elections. In January 2007, it was proposed by Democrats in the House that the 1993-1994 procedure be revived. The House approved the proposal with the adoption of H.Res. 78 by a vote of 226-191.|$|R

50|$|Smith's moral views {{have led}} him to take stands unusual for a Republican on {{domestic}} issues. In July 2003 he cast a critical <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>committee</b> for Henry Waxman's resolution of approval for future global climate change agreements. In October 2004 he voted against James Sensenbrenner's amendment broadening the category of illegal immigrants subject to immediate deportation.|$|R
40|$|By {{virtue of}} the Kemeny {{distance}} strategy-proofness of preference rules is defined. It is shown that a preference rule, which assigns a complete relation to every profile of complete relations is non-imposed and strategy-proof {{if and only if}} it is pairwise <b>voting</b> <b>in</b> <b>committees.</b> So, non-imposedness and strategy-proofness together imply the independence of irrelevant alternatives condition. Furthermore, it is shown that in this setting pairwise <b>voting</b> <b>in</b> <b>committees</b> coincides with coordinatewise veto voting. Taking acyclic preference rules into consideration, which assign an acyclic complete relation to every profile of acyclic complete relations, it follows that under strategy-proofness and non-imposition the independence of irrelevant alternatives is equivalent to indifference monotonicity. Now it follows that an acyclic preference rule is non-imposed, strategy-proof and indifference monotonic if and only if it is coordinatewise veto voting with respect to a cycle free assignment of disagreements. — 2 — § 1.

50|$|With {{the vote}} now likely 35-34 {{in favor of}} the amendment, the Government was faced with a dilemma. The Chairman of Committees, Nationalist James Bayley, could not cast a deliberative <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>committee,</b> only a casting vote if the numbers were tied. However, it was {{possible}} for the Speaker, Nationalist Sir Littleton Groom, to cast a deliberative <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> the <b>committee</b> (though not {{on the floor of the}} House, where the Speaker has only a casting vote). Bruce implored Groom to vote against the amendment <b>in</b> <b>committee</b> so that Bayley could defeat the measure with his tie-breaking vote. However, Groom was steadfast that he would follow the British House of Commons (though not Australian) precedent that the Speaker remain impartial and not <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>committee.</b> There was also some suspicion of vengeance in his decision, as Groom had been demoted from Attorney-General to Speaker the a few years previously, a move he had reputedly been unhappy about. With Groom abstaining, the amendment passed by one vote as predicted. Treating the passage of the amendment as a traditional defeat in a motion of no-confidence, after adjournment on 12 September Bruce announced to the House that the Governor-General had accepted his advice to call a new election, despite some speculation a government led by John Latham, James Scullin or (somewhat implausibly) Billy Hughes might be attempted.|$|R
