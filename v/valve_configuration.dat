25|$|A marching {{version of}} the {{euphonium}} {{may be found in}} a marching band, though it is often replaced by its smaller, easier-to-carry cousin, the marching baritone (which has a similar bell and <b>valve</b> <b>configuration</b> to a trumpet). Marching euphoniums are used by marching bands in schools, and in Drum and Bugle Corps, and some corps (such as the Blue Devils and Phantom Regiment) march all-euphonium sections rather than only marching Baritone or a mix of both. Depending on the manufacturer, the weight of these instruments can be straining to the average marcher and require great strength to hold during practices and performances, leading to nerve problems in the right pinky, a callous on the left hand, and possibly back and arm problems.|$|E

2500|$|Of all {{cylinder}} layouts without {{balance shaft}} a straight eight design has very low inherent vibration, while the side-valve layout contains {{the moving parts}} of the valve train within the cast-iron block, enabling it to be very quiet compared to an overhead <b>valve</b> <b>configuration</b> (as in the contemporary Buick engines). Combined with a substantial exhaust manifold and effective intake and exhaust muffling {{this can lead to}} a very quiet vehicle, both internally and externally. At the time of its use a quiet engine was thought to be a mark of quality in an automobile. Bores need be of small diameter to keep the engine length down and so strokes must be long to obtain larger displacements - such configurations (called [...] "undersquare") exhibit good low-rpm torque and are capable of slow idle speeds, enhancing both drivability and quietness. While Chrysler vehicles had similar engines they were not targeted for the lower middle price range enabled by General Motors' manufacturing expertise and volumes of the time.|$|E

50|$|The valide {{trombone}} is a valve-slide hybrid combination trombone {{invented by}} jazz musician Brad Gowans. The valide is a predecessor of the Superbone {{but is not}} the same instrument. The slide on the valide is at the inside of the <b>valve</b> <b>configuration,</b> and does not lock, requiring the player to hold the slide at all times and thus encouraging the player to use both the valve and the slide hands (versus the later Superbone, where the slide is to the outside of the <b>valve</b> <b>configuration</b> and does lock, meaning its use is optional and does not always have to be held). The valide was most popularly manufactured by the Getzen Corporation in the 1940s and early 1950s, when its orchestra use waned. The last noted player of the valide trombone was Juan Tizol of the Duke Ellington and Harry James Orchestras.|$|E
5000|$|The piccolo soprano entered regular {{production}} {{during the}} two piston valve bugle era in the late 1970s, and very closely resembles a G soprano trumpet in size. Piccolo sopranos were made in both two and three <b>valve</b> <b>configurations,</b> and are no longer mass-produced, but available as custom orders. The primary difference between a G trumpet and a G piccolo soprano is the throat of the bell and the bore size. G trumpets typically have a bore size of [...]440"-.450" [...] while the G piccolo soprano was offered in a larger [...]468" [...] bore.

Three <b>valve</b> <b>configurations</b> are considered: open orifice, open valve, and operating valve. Measurements of axial and tangential velocity components have been taken at various axial and radial positions for one compression ratio (7 : 1) and one rpm level (31). The measurements show that the intake stroke (in both two and four stroke operations) result in a recirculating flow with substantial turbulence generation even at the low rpm value. The four-stroke results in an axisymmetric design are novel and especially significant since the ability exists to make comparisons with theoretical, axisymmetric, turbulent results...|$|R

40|$|Hydraulic {{systems will}} {{continue}} {{to play an important}} role in our society because of their large power to weight ratios and compact actuators. Hydraulic servo-systems will only become more ubiquitous as demands for increased performance, faster production, tighter tolerances and more efficient operation continue to become more stringent. There is a need for energy-efficient hydraulic systems which can deliver the high performance control required in today’s society. ^ In this thesis, the technologies of independent metering valves, cross-port regeneration and accumulator-based energy recovery systems and the reasons why they are able to boost the efficiency of hydraulic systems are discussed. A control methodology including low-level adaptive robust control (ARC) of the flow rates and high-level decision logic is presented for simultaneously achieving high performance and energy-efficient operation for hydraulic systems with these features. ^ An experimental setup consisting of a scaled-down hydraulic excavator arm is used as a case study. Model parameters are identified and a correlated system model for the swing motion is presented. This system is then used to illustrate the control design procedure. The ARC algorithm is quite flexible and is applied without major modification to systems using four different <b>valve</b> <b>configurations.</b> A systematic method is proposed for selecting the controller gains to reduce the amount of trial and error required for this task. ^ The ARC algorithm guarantees high performance motion control even in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances by combining adjustable nonlinear model compensation with robust feedback. The model compensation is adjusted by controlled parameter adaptation. The high-level logic selects the most efficient way to implement the flow rates determined by the ARC algorithm and also determines the pressure level at which the system can operate most efficiently. ^ Simulation results are presented which demonstrate the ability to achieve both precision motion control and increase energy efficiency using the proposed control strategy. These results clearly show the operation and benefits of independent metering, cross-port regeneration and energy recovery. ^ Experimental results were obtained for one of the <b>valve</b> <b>configurations</b> studied. The tracking performance achieved demonstrates the effectiveness of the control algorithm. Additional experimental results are still needed to confirm that the energy efficiency predicted by the simulations can be achieved without loss of performance in practice. ^ The addition of an energy recovery accumulator to a system with an under-utilized constant pressure source can allow the system to approach the efficiency which would be obtained by using a load-sensing pump. There is potential for increased efficiency by using a central energy recovery accumulator on systems with multiple actuators, since the accumulator is able to recover energy normally lost to throttling for actuators with widelyvarying pressure requirements. ...|$|R

50|$|Although a wedge-head design offers {{simplified}} valve actuation, {{it usually}} does so {{by placing the}} valves side by side within the chamber, with parallel stem axis.

40|$|Grafts used in aortic valve-sparing {{procedures}} should ideally {{not only}} reproduce {{the geometry of}} the natural aortic root but also its material properties. Indeed, {{a number of studies}} using the finite element method have shown the importance of the natural sinus shape of the root in the functioning of the normal aortic valve, and the relative increase in stresses due to the replacement of the valve by a stiffer synthetic graft. Because of the wide range in experimentally measured values of aortic wall and leaflet material properties, studies by different research groups have incorporated very different material properties in their models. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the influence of material properties on aortic wall displacements, and to determine which material properties would most closely match reported experimental data. Two geometrically accurate 3 D models corresponding to the closed and open <b>valve</b> <b>configurations</b> were created in Pro/Engineer CAD software. Loads corresponding to systolic and diastolic pressures were specified and large-displacement structural analyses were carried out using the ANSYS package. Results have indicated that the closest match to experiments using isotropic material properties occurred for a Young's modulus of about 2000 KPa. Nonlinear models based on experimental stress-strain curves have shown similar displacements, but altered strain distribution patterns and significantly lower stresses. These results suggest that an accurate comparison of potential new graft models would have to be made with natural aortic valve models incorporating nonlinear material behavior. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from American Society of Civil Engineers via the DOI in this record. Isolation valves are crucial components of water distribution systems for separating pipe segments from the network for repair or maintenance purpose. This paper looks at the impacts of isolation valves failure on the three indictors including number of valves that are needed to isolate a distribution system segment, the size of distribution system segments and the shortfall in meeting demands during failure. A network with various isolation <b>valve</b> <b>configurations</b> {{in terms of the}} density of valves is used as a case study. The results obtained from the case study show that the failure of an isolation valve has substantially varying impacts on system performance during a shutdown. The density of valves in the network determines impacts of inoperable valves on a shutdown. Generally speaking, a higher density of isolation valves leads to the less impact of valve failure. Finally, several conclusions drawn from the critical valve analysis in this study could be applied to guide the isolation valve maintenance and management. Bentley Systems provided the software to conduct the hydraulic simulation and valve segmentation.
