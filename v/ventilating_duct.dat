40|$|Abstract-In the {{development}} of the deeper British coal seams there are three basic climatic questions to which the mining engineer requires answers, namely, what will be the working temperatures, how will man's output of work be affected by such tem-peratures, and what amelioration, if any, will be required. These questions are discussed in a sequence appropriate to the opening up and development of a mine, covering shaft sinking, advancing headings and fully ventilated roads and coal faces. The facts that are required by the mining engineer when calculating the temperatures of mine air are listed and, where possible, the methods of predicting the temperatures are described. The lines on which research is proceeding to extend the present limited knowledge are indicated. A brief reference is made to the special climatic problems associated with the continuous machine mining of headings.

40|$|It must be {{emphasized}} that all superadiabatic lapse rates at or near cloud tops should not be treated indiscriminately {{as an indication of}} adiabatic lifting. Certainly other concurrent changes in atmospheric conditions are important and should not be minimized. Furthermore, certain types of radiosondes, such as the ones using the exposed whitecoated thermistors, may be more susceptible to collecting and freezing of small water droplets from which instrumental superadiabatic lapse rates may result, than those which protect the thermistor in a <b>ventilating</b> <b>duct</b> from direct impingement of rain and cloud droplets. It may be that the observed phenomenon is the combination of several processes, such as (1) cooling at the saturateddry air interface due to adiabatic lifting, (2) evaporative cooling at the cloud top, and (3) evaporative cooling of th...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{method has}} been developed for predicting the directivity of the sound that is radiated {{from one side of}} a panel, or an opening, which is excited by sound incident {{from the other side of}} the panel, or the opening, from a room or duct. This directivity needs to be known when one is predicting the sound level at an external position which is due to the radiation of sound from the roof, wall, <b>ventilating</b> <b>duct</b> or chimney flue of a factory. The theoretical method is essentially a two dimensional method, although it does include some three dimensional considerations. This paper compares this theoretical method with published experimental data. The theory presented in this paper agrees with the average trend of the experimental measurements. However the experimental results show significant variability about the theoretical predictions. This is believed to be due to both experimental and theoretical difficulties...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For {{the complex}} status of fluid flow in stator radial {{ventilation}} ducts of large turbo-generator, the temperature distribution of stator is dramatically {{affected by the}} flow status of cooling medium in stator <b>ventilating</b> <b>ducts.</b> In this paper, a new <b>ventilating</b> <b>ducts</b> structure in stator is investigated. According to fixing a wind deflector on the stator teeth adjacent to the ventilation ducts, the fluid flow status of cooling air is changed flowing in stator ventilation ducts. For this reason, the effect of heat transfer in stator is changed. Taking an air-cooled turbo-generator as an example, considering the characteristics of fluid flow and heat transfer in turbo-generator ventilation system, the three-dimensional fluid flow and heat transfer coupling model is established. Using finite volume method, three-dimensional fluid field and temperature field control equations are coupling solved. Based on this, the velocity distribution in <b>ventilating</b> <b>ducts</b> is obtained. Besides that, the velocity distribution is studied with the cooling air flows into radial ventilation ducts at different incident angles. The influences of wind deflector and incident angles on the fluid velocity and temperature distribution are analyzed. Based on that, some useful conclusions are obtained...|$|R

There is evidence of original ceiling hooks, and the box room contains an access manhole and a ladder leading down to an underground cellar approximately 5m by 5m in size. The cellar has wall niches for storage and two metal <b>ventilating</b> <b>ducts</b> leading to the outside air.

40|$|A novel {{low-speed}} flux-modulated (FM) permanent-magnet (PM) motor {{that breaks}} the traditional design rule, which stipulates {{that the number}} of stator pole pairs and the number of rotor pole pairs must be the same, is proposed. The FM motor has a special physical structure with iron segments in the air gap to modulate the magnetic field. In the design, the free space between adjacent stationary iron segments also acts as <b>ventilating</b> <b>ducts</b> to help improving the heat dissipation and ventilation of the motor. Its cogging torque is very small. In this paper, a rule for comparing the power density of electric motors is proposed. The performance of the FM motor is compared with those of a magnetic-geared PM motor, a traditional PM motor, and a fractional-slot PM motor by using magnetic field finite-element analysis.

40|$|The {{microbial}} and viral flora in the <b>ventilating</b> <b>ducts</b> of {{an apartment}} building was evaluated. Several types of sampler (slit sampler, Andersen sampler, large volume air sampler) were {{used to evaluate the}} hourly, weekly and seasonal variation of this flora. The mean bacterial concentration was 17. 2 e. f. u. /m 3 with a maximum level at 07. 30 h (41. 3 c. f. u. /m 3) and a minimal concentration in the early afternoon (8 c. f. u. /m 3). The bacterial concentration observed correlated with the relative humidity in the air-ducts although there were no seasonal differences. The bacteria were mainly gram-positive cocci (73. 5 %) represented by a large number of Micrococcaceae (47. 1 %); gram-positive bacilli accounted for 14. 2 % of the isolates, gram-negative bacilli 12. 0 % and gram-negative cocci 0. 3 %. The majority of the bacteria-carrying particles were in the respirable range with 80. 4 % of them being less than 5 microns. The methods used did not result in the isolation of viruses during the winter sampling period...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines made {{time-dependent}} calculations {{to determine}} {{the size of a}} stationary source fire within a <b>ventilated</b> <b>duct</b> (or passage-way) necessary to ignite a combustible duct liner. The objective of this work was to gain more understanding of what occurs in duct fires and to determine critical conditions for ignition and propagation of mine fires. Heat transfer to the combustible surface includes both convective and radiated components, while the heat is conducted into the combustible and reradiated to the surroundings. The combustible is assumed to ignite when the net heat transfer to its surface is sufficient to raise the surface temperature to some minimum temperature, defined as the ignition temperature. A nondimensional parameter, which characterizes the source-fire intensity in the presence of ventilation flow, emerges as a parameter for a criterion of the critical conditions. The results of these calculations indicated that the minimum fire size necessary for ignition increases with the ventilation rate and duct cross section. These results are compared with experimental results obtained from fires in a 0. 8 -by 0. 8 -by Il-m-long duct and a full-scale gallery (2. 4 -by 2. 4 -by 65 -m). Agreement between the theory and the experiment is good...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of massive concrete structures is often conditioned by {{the necessity of}} phasing casting operations {{in order to avoid}} excessive heat accumulation due to cement hydration. To accelerate construction and allow larger casting stages (usually increasing lift height), it is usual to adopt internal cooling strategies based on embedding water pipes into concrete, through which water is circulated to minimize temperature development. The present paper reports the use of horizontally placed <b>ventilated</b> prestressing <b>ducts</b> embedded in a massive concrete wall for the same purpose, in line with a preliminary Swedish proposal made in the 1990 s. The application herein reported is a holistic approach to the problem under study, encompassing extensive laboratory characterization of the materials (including a technique developed for continuous monitoring of concrete E-modulus since casting), in situ monitoring of temperatures and strains, and 3 D thermo-mechanical simulation using the finite element method. Based on the monitored/simulated results, it is concluded that the air-cooling system is feasible and can effectively reduce early cracking risk of concrete, provided adequate planning measures are taken.
