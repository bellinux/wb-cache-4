40|$|Abstract Background A Q-fever {{outbreak}} {{occurred in}} an urban area {{in the south of}} the Netherlands in May 2008. The distribution and timing of cases suggested a common source. We studied the spatial relationship between the residence locations of human cases and nearby small ruminant farms, of which one dairy goat farm had experienced abortions due to Q-fever since mid April 2008. A generic geographic information system (GIS) was used to develop a method for source detection in the still evolving major epidemic of Q-fever in the Netherlands. Methods All notified Q-fever cases in the area were interviewed. Postal codes of cases and of small ruminant farms (size > 40 animals) located within 5 kilometres of the cluster area were geo-referenced as point locations in a GIS-model. For each farm, attack rates and relative risks were calculated for 5 concentric zones adding 1 kilometre at a time, using the 5 - 10 kilometres zone as reference. These data were linked to the results of <b>veterinary</b> <b>investigations.</b> Results Persons living within 2 kilometres of an affected dairy goat farm (> 400 animals) had a much higher risk for Q-fever than those living more than 5 kilometres away (Relative risk 31. 1 [95 % CI 16. 4 - 59. 1]). Conclusions The study supported the hypothesis that a single dairy goat farm was the source of the human outbreak. GIS-based attack rate analysis is a promising tool for source detection in outbreaks of human Q-fever. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Systemic {{hypertension}} {{is known}} to be a common consequence of chronic renal disease, which is frequently diagnosed in dogs with visceral leishmaniasis. Although many <b>veterinary</b> <b>investigations</b> have looked at the renal injury caused by Leishmania spp., the role played by this complication in the development of arterial hypertension documented in some animals with visceral leishmaniasis is not completely understood. In this study, 18 adult dogs with naturally-occurring visceral leishmaniasis and varying clinical signs underwent an indirect blood pressure measurement. Also, sera and spot urine were used for laboratory tests. The median systolic blood pressure was 135. 2 mmHg (95 % confidence interval: 128. 5 - 147. 7), median mean arterial pressure was 105. 8 mmHg (98. 3 - 110. 4), and median diastolic arterial pressure was 88. 5 mmHg (77. 8 - 92. 5). No differences existed between asymptomatic and symptomatic animals regarding arterial pressure, and no correlations were documented between blood pressure and serum creatinine, blood urea, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, urine specific gravity, and the fractional excretion of sodium and potassium. Although an association between hypertension and the identification of inflammation on histopathology could not be demonstrated in hypertensive animals, the assessment of kidney samples from 12 dogs indicated mild inflammation with a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (6 / 12), moderate inflammation with multifocal lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic infiltrates (3 / 12), and multifocal degeneration and protein casts (2 / 12). Anti-Leishmania spp. immunohistochemistry assays stained the renal epithelium in 2 / 12 of the animals. Even though mild systemic hypertension was documented in a small subset of animals, no relationship between the severity of clinical signs and hypertension could be anticipated...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBenzimidazole {{resistance}} is common amongst many ovine trichostrongylid nematodes species globally. Although anthelmintics {{have been used}} for over half a century in some areas of the world for the control of Nematodirus battus, resistance has never been detected. <b>Veterinary</b> <b>investigations</b> conducted in 2010 demonstrated reduced efficacy in a flock that had been treated previously with fenbendazole (FBZ), suggesting probable resistance in N. battus. Infective larvae (L 3; designated MNba 2) were generated from the original material to conduct a controlled efficacy test (CET). Faecal egg counts showed an average of 37 % reduction in the FBZ treated group 7  days post treatment compared to the untreated lambs. Average worm burden results showed no reduction after FBZ treatment compared to the untreated group (3850 and 3850 worms respectively). A molecular assay to assess the frequency of the commonly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the β-tubulin isotype 1 gene, F 200 Y and E 198 A, was developed. Larval genotypes were predominantly homozygous resistant at codon 200 SNP, ranging from 56 %- 83 % and remained stable at 70 % for adult worm populations taken from treated and control lambs in the CET. Only susceptible genotypes were found at codon 198. The allele frequency for F 200 Y ranged between 80 - 83 % in adult worms taken from the CET from treated and control lambs. The results confirmed initial findings and demonstrated the first report of FBZ resistance in N. battus whilst providing evidence that the P 200 point mutation in the β-tubulin isotype 1 gene is a potential mechanism of resistance in the species...|$|R

40|$|The double-crested {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocorax auritus) {{is the primary}} avian predator on the southern catfish industry, estimated to cause $ 5 million in damage per year. To date, the most effective strategy for alleviating cormorant depredations in areas of intensive catfish production is coordinated dispersal of cormorant night roosts with pyrotechnics. Many of these night roosts are located in waterfowl refuges or wetland habitat leased for waterfowl hunting. Thus, there is an increasing concern {{about the effects of}} cormorant harassment efforts on waterfowl and other wildlife inhabiting these sites in cypress-swamp habitat. To address the need for a roost harassment device that was more species-specific, we evaluated two commercially available low- to moderate-powered lasers in a series of large-pen and field trials for their effectiveness in moving cormorants from test ponds and dispersing cormorants from their night roosts, respectively. In pen trials, laser beams directed at small groups of captive birds produced negligible effects, suggesting that the laser light was not highly aversive. This was consistent with a series of <b>veterinary</b> <b>investigations</b> suggesting no detectable ocular damage to cormorant eyes directly exposed to a selected laser at varying distances down to 1 m. During field trials both lasers, directed at roost trees after sunset, were consistently effective in dispersing cormorants in 1 to 3 evenings of harassment and is comparable to the harassment effort needed with pyrotechnics. Because laser treatment is completely silent and can be directed selectively at cormorants, these devices may be extremely useful for dispersing cormorants in sites where disturbance of other wildlife is a concern. Advantages and disadvantages of lasers relative to pyrotechnics are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Public {{health is}} {{threaten}} by imbalances {{in the distribution}} of chemical elements in the environment resulting from natural or/and anthropogenic activities. Of significance are toxicities resulting from anthropogenic activities such as mining, ore mineral processing, indiscriminate waste disposal, and the use of pesticides in agriculture etc. To reduce the impact of these chemical elements on the environment and their consequence human health effects, there is need for the establishment of toxicological health facility {{in the vicinity of the}} mining communities in other to minimize the problem of wrong diagnosis as often is the case. Unfortunately, modern geochemical data are rarely available for developing countries, or may be inadequate for environmental purposes, having been collected principally for mineral exploration. Geochemical surveys (ideally incorporating data for soil, stream-sediment, natural/mine dust, vegetation and water samples) are of considerable value in studies linking the environment, food and health. Geochemical maps are pointers to potential areas of chemical element deficiency or toxicity, enabling expensive <b>veterinary</b> or medical <b>investigations</b> to be better targeted.

Altered serotonergic metabolism has been described in human gastrointestinal diseases. The objective of our study was to compare expression of several components of the serotonergic system [serotonin (5 -HT), serotonin reuptake transporter protein (SERT), tryptophan hydroxylase- 1 (TPH- 1), 5 -HT receptor[subscript 2 B] (5 -HT[subscript 2 B]) ] and the enterochromaffin cell marker chromogranin-A (CgA) in the intestinal mucosa between dogs with chronic enteropathy and healthy controls. Serotonin and CgA expression were determined by immunohistochemistry using banked and prospectively obtained, paraffin-embedded canine gastrointestinal biopsies (n = 11), and compared to a control group of canine small intestinal sections (n = 10). Expression of SERT, TPH- 1, and 5 -HT[subscript 2 B] were determined via real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using prospectively collected endoscopic duodenal biopsies (n = 10) and compared to an additional control group of control duodenal biopsies (n = 8, Control Group 2) showing no evidence of intestinal inflammation. Dogs with chronic enteropathies showed strong staining for both 5 -HT and CgA. Mean positive cells per high power field (HPF) were significantly increased for both compounds in dogs with chronic enteropathies (p < 0. 001 for 5 -HT and p < 0. 05 CgA). The number of 5 -HT–positive and CgA-positive cells/HPF showed significant correlation in the entire group of dogs, including both diseased and healthy individuals (Pearson r² = 0. 2433, p = 0. 016). No significant differences were observed for SERT, TPH- 1, or 5 -HT[subscript 2 B] expression; however, dogs with chronic enteropathy showed greater variability in expression of TPH- 1 and 5 -HT[subscript 2 B]. We conclude that components of the neuroendocrine system show altered expression in the intestinal mucosa of dogs with chronic enteropathy. These changes may contribute to nociception and clinical signs in these patients...|$|R
