40|$|Explosion {{tests were}} carried out in four medium-scale test-vessels {{incorporating}} closed, <b>vented,</b> <b>duct</b> <b>vented</b> and interconnected vessels. A systematic investigation into the influence of homogeneous and stratified mixtures was undertaken by varying mixture reactivity, ignition position, injection position and mixture composition. A feature of this work has been the similarities in explosion phenomena between stratified and homogeneous explosions and between partially filled and fully filled geometries {{to the conclusion that}} the explosion severity recorded in stratified mixtures towards the lean flammability limit was in many cases much higher than the fuel concentration would normally suggest. Stratified mixtures with global equivalence ratio around stoichiometric produced significantly lower pressures than their homogeneous equivalents. However, stratified (globally) near-limit mixtures produced overpressures that were several hundred mbar higher than those of the equivalent homogeneous mixtures. Even beyond the flammable range (globally) the stratified mixtures produced significant overpressures. The phenomena discussed in this thesis illustrate the difficulty in designing adequate protection for such <b>vented,</b> <b>duct</b> <b>vented</b> and interconnected geometries, since even relatively small pocket of weak fuel-air mixtures produced relatively severe explosions. This can have implications for the safety design of inter-connected installations which are not intended to be subject to flammable mixtures. While it is an important conclusion from the work presented in this chapter that close to the flammability limits the stratified explosion severity was greater than its global concentration would normally indicate, it should be stressed that homogeneous stoichiometric tests still constitute the worst case tests. Therefore, it is not the suggestion of this work that the design of vented vessels should be modified to represent the maxima obtained in stratified work. However, the value of this research in the field of post-explosion investigation is clear. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{the study}} is to analyse the effect of the design and methods for heating the {{ventilation}} duct of a buoyancy- driven system on the formation of free convective air currents in it. Methods. The study of free convection under the conditions of interior problem was carried out using the CFD software, based on  the finite volume method with unstructured grid. Ansys Fluent software was used as a calculation tool in the study, due to its having a high convergence of numerical solutions offering full-scale  measurements of convective currents. To evaluate the reliability of  the results obtained, a validation procedure was carried out, allowing us to determine how accurately the selected conceptual model describes the investigated flow through a comparison of experimental and numerical data. Results. The results of numerical modelling of free convective currents occurring in the heated channel of the ventilation system of  the top floor of a multi-storey residential building are presented in  the article. In the course of the study, the air velocity {{at the entrance to the}} ventilation duct was found to depend on the calculated  temperature difference θ ˚C for various heating methods.  A gradual  increase in the discrepancy between the numerical simulation and  experimental results is observed if the calculated temperature  difference > 20 ° C. This phenomenon is due to the fact that with  increased duct temperature, it is quite difficult to achieve even  heating under actual conditions; this is especially noticeable when  considering the variant when the vertical part of the <b>vent</b> <b>duct</b> and the take-off are both heated. The maximum deviation of the  results is 4. 4 %. The obtained velocity profiles in the calculated  sections indicate the impact of the ventilation take-off on the nature  of the air flow motion. Conclusion. One of the drawbacks of the existing systems of natural ventilation of residential buildings is the low efficiency of work in the  warm and transitional periods of the year, especially in bathrooms.   The use of buoyancy-driven ventilation with vertical heating of the  <b>vent</b> <b>duct</b> combined with the take-off allows a stable air exchange in the rooms to be provided. </p...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} years, catastrophic dust {{explosion}} incidents have caused numerous injuries, fatalities and economical losses. Dust explosions are rapid exothermic reactions {{that take place}} when a combustible dust is mixed with air {{in the presence of}} an ignition source within a confined space. A variety of strategies are currently available to prevent dust explosion accidents. However, the recurrence of these tragic events confirms flaws in process safety for dust handling industries. This dissertation reports advances in different approaches that can be followed to prevent and mitigate dust explosions. For this research, a 36 L dust explosion vessel was designed, assembled and automated to perform controlled dust explosion experiments. First, we explored the effect of size polydispersity on the evolution of aluminum dust explosions. By modifying systematically the span of the particle size distribution we demonstrated the dramatic effect of polydispersity on the initiation and propagation of aluminum dust explosions. A semi-empirical combustion model was used to quantify the laminar burning velocity at varying particle size. Moreover, correlations between ignition sensitivity and rate of pressure rise with polydispersity were developed. Second, we analyzed the effect of particle size and crystalline levels in the decomposition reactions of explosion inhibitor agents (i. e., phosphates). We fractionated ammonium phosphate- monobasic (NH_ 4 H_ 2 PO_ 4) and dibasic ((NH_ 4) _ 2 HPO_ 4) at different size ranges, and synthesized zirconium phosphate (Zr(HPO_ 4) _ 2 ?H_ 2 O) at varying size and crystalline levels. Particle size was found to be crucial to improve the rate of heat absorption of each inhibitor. A simplified model was developed to identify factors dominating the efficiency of dust explosion inhibitors. Finally, we conducted computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations to predict overpressures in dust explosions vented through ducts in large scale scenarios. We particularly focused on the adverse effects caused by flow restrictions in vent ducts. Critical parameters, including ignition position, geometric configuration of the <b>vent</b> <b>duct,</b> and obstructions of outflow such as bends and panels were investigated. Comparison between simulation and experimental results elucidated potential improvements in available guidelines. The theoretical analyses complemented the experimental work to provide {{a better understanding of the}} effects of particle size on the evolution of dust explosions. Furthermore, the validation of advanced simulation tools is considered crucial to overcome current limitations in predicting dust explosions in large scale scenarios...|$|E

To avoid this difficulty, vents can be placed on other sides of the building (besides the roof), or separate segments of pipes can be installed. A narrower pipe in the roof that fits snugly into a larger segment within the building can also be used. The threat of water seepage, condensation, and poor indoor air quality can all be overcome with proper waterproofing and ventilation.|$|R

The testing of the fans was one of the most comprehensive ever, covering flowrate and pressure, power measurements, sound levels, bearing vibration, x-raying of all impeller components, high-temperature tests at 200 °C for 2 hours, impeller strain, and 24-hour run tests for reversals.|$|R
40|$|Venting {{devices are}} the main {{solution}} for the mitigation of accidental explosion. However, relief ducts are mandatory for the discharge of combustion products to safe location. On the other hand, {{the presence of a}} duct is likely to increase the severity of the explosion with respect to simply vented vessels. To this regard, several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the enhanced violence of the explosion in such configuration: secondary explosion in the duct (burnup), frictional drag and inertia of the gas column in the duct, acoustic and Helmholtz oscillations. The relative effects of the cited phenomena and their weight on maximum pressure reached during <b>ducted</b> <b>vented</b> explosion is uncertain. As a consequence, appropriate design of ductventing configuration is still a matter of debate and it’s not surprising that the available guidelines for the design of <b>ducted</b> <b>vents</b> for gas explosions can lead to gross errors. The authors have recently proposed experimental and numerical analyses (Computational Fluid Dynamics) for the analysis of duct-vented phenomena on the peak pressure measured in either small, medium or large scale equipment. Results of these studies highlighted that the two main phenomena responsible for the increased peak pressure are: i) the explosion occurring in the initial sections of the duct leading to a backflow from the duct towards the main vessel, thus restricting the effective vent section; ii) the turbulization of flame within the combustion chamber, due to the backflow, which enhances the combustion rate and the rate of pressure rise. In this paper, we propose an engineering correlation based on semi-empirical engineering methodologies aiming at quantifying the relation between the geometric properties (<b>venting</b> section, <b>duct</b> length, vessel volume) and the peak pressure occurring in the combustion chamber {{in the presence of a}} duct fitted on the vent panel...|$|R

40|$|Membrane gas {{absorption}} and desorption (MGA/MGD) for {{the removal}} of CO 2 in manned spacecraft or other enclosed environment is subject of study by Stork and TNO for many years. The system is based on the combination of membrane separation and gas absorption. Advantage of this technology is that the system not only can be used to remove the carbon dioxide but also to control the relative humidity and temperature. Absorption of moisture and heat is achieved by cooling the absorption liquid below the dewpoint temperature of the gas stream. From the start in 1995, the Crew Transfer Vehicle is used as a basis for the design (1, 2). Compared to the planned air conditioning system, consisting of a condensing heat exchanger, LiOH cartridges and a water evaporator assembly, MGA/MGD shows advantage in volume, mass and power consumption. The absorption liquid circulates through the spacecraft thermal control loop, replacing the coolant water. The CO 2 absorption capacity of the absorption liquid is restored in a desorption unit. This process is based on pervaporation. The absorption liquid is led through this membrane unit in which a reduced pressure is maintained using the space vacuum. Due to this pressure difference a driving force for water vapor and CO 2 is created. The water evaporation and the CO 2 desorption rate are controlled by a throttle valve in the <b>venting</b> <b>duct</b> to the vacuum source. Because the absorption liquid is used as coolant, temperature increases, a driving force for water vapor and CO 2 mass transfer is created. Should additional heat rejection be required (off nominal case), it is established by dumping extra water, using the associated heat of vaporization. For the initial studies an existing laboratory set-up has been applied for the practical work. In 1999 a project started on the development of a dedicated breadboard. In this paper, the test results of this breadboard assembly will be presented. Copyright © 2003 SAE International...|$|R
