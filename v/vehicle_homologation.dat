40|$|Railway <b>vehicle</b> <b>homologation,</b> {{with respect}} to running dynamics, is {{addressed}} via dedicated norms.

40|$|Road <b>vehicle</b> <b>homologation</b> {{has become}} more and more {{challenging}} due to the introduction of stringent regulations regarding pollutant emissions. In order to fulfil these requirements, the focus in automotive industry mainly settled on the improvement of the engine performance in terms of fuel consumption. Another design approach aims at the vehicle lightening, yet in the respect of the safety standards. In the present work a methodology for preliminary space-frame chassis design for rear-central engine sport cars is proposed. The purpose is to design a chassis able to attain given performance goals in view of weight reduction. The design problem is faced using finite element analysis. The chassis numerical model is made of shell elements and is split into three sub-models: front, central, and rear. This allows the parallelization of the work among different teams. The sub-models undergo topometry and size optimizations in order to asses the optimal shell thickness distribution...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a joint study {{carried out by}} SNCF and Dipartimento di Meccanica Politecnico di Milano, aimed at investigating how parametric uncertainty can be treated {{in the framework of}} virtual homologation of railway vehicles in respect to vehicle dynamics. In railway vehicle sources of parameter uncertainty may arise from inaccuracy in the modelling of a vehicle component or from a scatter in the behaviour of nominally identical components, on account of the variability implied by the component manufacturing process. The approach proposed in this paper, completely new in the railway field, is to use statistical methods having different complexity (and entailing a proportional computational effort), to analyse the propagation of uncertainty from the parameters input in the vehicle mathematical model to the results of running dynamics, in terms of the assessment quantities used for <b>vehicle</b> <b>homologation.</b> The problem is treated by numerical means, being the dependency of simulation outputs from the input parameters typically non-linear, and not defined in an analytical form...|$|E

40|$|Track {{geometry}} {{quality has}} an important influence on the dynamic behaviour of the vehicles. Control of track geometry during the maintenance process and for the <b>vehicle</b> assessment (<b>homologation)</b> is necessary. Within the project, DYNOTRAIN methods for describing and assessing track geometry have been studied. Data from a comprehensive test campaign {{have been used to}} measure the effectiveness of different track geometry assessment methods. The vehicle behaviour has been studied by a multiple regression model with varying track geometry description methods. It had been shown that it is essential to include track geometry in the vehicle assessment process in a proper way. Depending on the assessment quantity and the vehicle type, the mostly used method in Europe (standard deviation in wavelength range 3 – 25 m) allows in combination with speed, cant deficiency and curvature the explanation of 20 – 80 % of the total variation of the vehicle reaction. Other methods and ‘new’alternative methods intended to model a typical vehicle behaviour mostly give no or only a small improvement...|$|R

40|$|The actual European {{regulations}} in matter of rail <b>vehicle</b> <b>homologation</b> prescribe to measure not only accelerations but also contact forces exchanged at wheel-rail interface, {{in order to}} state the level of running safety, track loading and vibration behaviour. It is {{important to point out}} that the standards do not prescribe any specific method to measure forces, nevertheless define any metrological requirement of the measuring system. Aim of this paper is to investigate the metrological properties of a dynamometric wheelset in order to determine the associated measurement uncertainty and to verify its readiness in the range of frequencies where the force analysis have to be performed. With reference to a specific instrumented wheelset, the calibration procedure was performed using a dedicated test-rig developed in the laboratories of the Department of Mechanical Engineering - Politecnico di Milano. The test-rig allows a static calibration of the system. Dynamic tests have been performed, imposing a random or an impulsive excitation to the wheelset, in order to define the bandwidth of the measuring system...|$|E
40|$|A {{squealing}} {{noise of}} 50 dB was {{measured on a}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>homologation</b> test at around 900 Hz on the existing brake drum design, mounted on the rear axle of the mid-sized passenger automobile. Therefore, analysis of eigenfrequencies of the original drum design was performed using the impact hammer test and numerical analysis. It was established that a critical mode shape 0 / 2 exists at around 900 Hz, exactly where the squeal noise was recorded at the brake road noise evaluation vehicle test. The analysis was carried out with the intention to eliminate {{the possibility of the}} squealing noise by increasing the critical mode above 900 Hz. The relation between different brake drum modifications parameters and the eigenfrequencies was determined and the best solution was obtained. The first eigenfrequency of the proposed drum design was increased by 58 Hz and the difference between the in-plane and out-of plane mode shape was sufficient. We can conclude that the modified drum design will not have squeal issues at 900 Hz as there are no eigenfrequencies of the brake drum in that range and therefore the problem of the loud brake is solved...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- Crash {{tests and}} {{numerical}} simulations are a vital {{source of information}} when designing safety elements for <b>vehicles.</b> To obtain <b>homologation</b> the <b>vehicle's</b> crash safety needs to be demonstrated. Based on three tests Euro NCAP program presents objective and comparable safety performances. Student Roadster is a prototype and will remain the only one built, therefore its adequacy has to be proven using a numerical simulation. The first stage of the simulation was a crash of the front bumper against an obstacle. The bumper is fixed on two dented beams that function as energy absorbers {{in the case of}} a crash. A 3 D model has been built and discretized with finite element method in Catia while the simulation of the crash was done in Ls-Dyna. The results illustrate the importance of indentations in energy absorbent beams for plastic deformations form in those areas. Upgrading the front bumper model, crash test simulation for the entire vehicle SR is currently in the process...|$|R

Further use and distribution of this paper requires permission from SAE International. It was also presented at the SAE 2010 World Congress, Detroit, USA, 12 th- 15 th April. New European emissions legislation (Euro 5) specifies a limit for Particle Number (PN) emissions and therefore drives measurement of PN during <b>vehicle</b> development and <b>homologation.</b> Concurrently, the use of biofuel is increasing in the marketplace, and Euro 5 specifies that reference fuel must contain a bio-derived portion.

Measurements were conducted with a Cambustion Differential Mobility Spectrometer (DMS) to time-resolve sub-micron particles (5 - 1000 nm), and a Horiba Solid Particle Counting System (SPCS) providing PN data from a Euro 5 -compliant measurement system.

40|$|The {{research}} project {{discussed in this}} paper was designed to subject the rolling noise measuring method based on a single-axle trailer, which had been worked out in the {{research project}} 'Development of a measuring method for tyre-road noise' (Project No. 105 05 211) in 1990, to detailed practical testing. The necessary tyre-road noise measurements were performed on {{a representative sample of}} commercial car tyres (n = 143). Apart from summer tyres, a limited number of winter and cross-country tyres were included in the sample. Tests also included remoulds as well as new tyres. Measurements were made on two different surfaces, an 0 / 8 asphalt concrete and 0 / 11 mastic asphalt. The former surface corresponds to the requirements of ISO standard 10844 (surface for <b>vehicle</b> <b>homologation</b> tests); the latter is typical for roads outside built-up areas. The study showed that the trailer drive-by method is fundamentally suitable for determining sound emission from car tyres. To ensure an adequate signal-to-noise ratio, the tractor vehicle must, however, be fitted with especially low-noise tyres and additional screening in the tyre area. In certain cases (when very low-noise tyres are being measured) the above steps are insufficient to guarantee a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 dB(A) (minimum signal-to-noise ratio: 7 dB(A)). This problem was, however, solved by means of special 'calibration drives' with the tractor vehicle and by subtracting the tractor vehicle energy component. (orig.)
