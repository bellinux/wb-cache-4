Case studies of smart card experience in Britain are examined, of the pensioner concessionary pass in Southport, Merseyside, and the commercially operated scheme in Bradford.

Using smart card data, estimates may be made of card turnover rates, trip rates per card on issue, and inferences made of the proportion of linked trips. In comparison with existing data sources, much larger samples may be obtained, and behaviour analysed over much longer periods. However, there are limitations, mainly that trip length is not recorded on systems based on validating cards only on entry to a bus, and that certain types of data still require direct survey methods for their collection (such as journey purpose).

This rapid decline of summertime Vis is found to be partially associated with the intensification and westward extension of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) that has occurred in recent years. Such a change in the strength and breadth of WPSH has resulted in more days with stable, hot, and humid weather, which is favorable for Vis decrease. Analysis through decomposing the trend of Vis into contributions respectively from days with and without WPSH-type meteorological conditions further shows that the intensification of WPSH leads to more episodes of Vis impairment and amplifies the effect of increased aerosol and precursor emissions on the summertime Vis decline in eastern China. Consequently, the difference of Vis between summer and winter follows a declining trend, although the Vis level in winter is still lower than that in summer. The result of this study underscores the importance of considering not only the variation of anthropogenic emissions, but also the change of climate and synoptic systems in the prediction and regulation of air quality and visibility...|$|E

Therefore, a study on a center pivot irrigated 23. 5 ha field in Saudi Arabia was conducted to assess the variability in alfalfa yield using Landsat- 8 imagery and a hay yield monitor data. In addition, the study was designed to also explore the potential of predicting the alfalfa yield using vegetation indices. A calibrated yield monitor mounted on a large rectangular hay baler was used to measure the actual alfalfa yield for four alfalfa harvests performed in the period from October 2013 to May 2014. A total of 18 Landsat- 8 images, representing different crop growth stages, were used to derive different vegetation indices (<b>VIs).</b> <b>Data</b> from the yield monitor was used to generate yield maps, which illustrated a definite spatial variation in alfalfa yield across the experimental field for the four studied harvests as indicated by the high spatial correlation values (0. 75 to 0. 97) and the low P-values (4. 7 E- 103 to 8. 9 E- 27).

The main {{contribution}} to oceans oil pollution is related to operational discharge from tankers (e. g. oil dumped during cleaning operations) that spread in the sea the equivalent of one full-tanker disaster every week. In order to reduce the environmental impact of such a kind of hazards, timely detection and continuously updated information are fundamental and satellite remote sensing could give an important contribution in such a direction. In particular meteorological satellite, thanks to their high temporal resolution and to an easy data delivery, can be profitably used for a near real time sea monitoring. Recently, two new methodologies for oil spill detection and monitoring, both based on the general Robust Satellite Technique (RST) approach, have been proposed. The first one, based on the multi-temporal analysis of AVHRR Thermal Infrared (TIR), have shown good capability in automatically detect, with high level of reliability, oil spill presence.

In this context, the objectives {{of this study are}} to develop a new vegetation index, namely, the Generalized Difference Vegetation Index (GDVI), and to examine its applicability to the assessment of dryland environment. Based on the field investigation and crop Leaf Area Index (LAI) measurement, five spring and summer Landsat TM and ETM+ images in the frame with Path/Row number of 174 / 35, and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) LAI and vegetation indices (<b>VIs)</b> <b>data</b> (MOD 15 A 2 and MOD 13 Q 1), of the same acquisition dates as the Landsat images, were acquired and employed in this study. The results reveal that, despite the same level of correlation with the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) as other VIs, GDVI shows a better correlation with LAI and has higher sensitivity and dynamic range in the low vegetal land cover than other vegetation indices, e. g., the range of GDVI is higher than Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI), and Soil-Adjusted and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (SARVI), by 164 %– 326 % in woodland, 185 %– 720 % in olive plantation, and 190 %– 867 % in rangeland.

40|$|Geostationary {{meteorological}} satellite infrared (IR) channel data contain important spectral information for meteorological research and applications, but their spatial resolution is relatively low. The {{objective of this}} study is to obtain higher-resolution IR images. One common method of increasing resolution fuses the IR data with high-resolution visible (<b>VIS)</b> channel <b>data.</b> However, most existing image fusion methods focus only on visual performance, and often fail to take into account the thermal physical properties of the IR images. As a result, spectral distortion occurs frequently. To tackle this problem, we propose a thermal physical properties-based correction method for fusing geostationary {{meteorological satellite}} IR and VIS images. In our two-step process, the high-resolution structural features of the VIS image are first extracted and incorporated into the IR image using regular multi-resolution fusion approach, such as the multiwavelet analysis. This step significantly increases the visual details in the IR image, but fake thermal information may be included. Next, the Stefan-Boltzmann Law is applied to correct the distortion, to retain or recover the thermal infrared nature of the fused image. The results of both the qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrate that the proposed physical correction method both improves the spatial resolution and preserves the infrared thermal properties...|$|R

40|$|A multi-layered cloud {{retrieval}} system (MCRS) is updated {{and used to}} estimate ice water path in maritime ice-over-water clouds using Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) and TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) measurements from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission spacecraft between January and August 1998. Lookup tables of top-of-atmosphere 0. 65 - m reflectance are developed for ice-over-water cloud systems using radiative transfer calculations with various combinations of ice-over-water cloud layers. The liquid and ice water paths, LWP and IWP, respectively, are determined with the MCRS using these lookup tables {{with a combination of}} microwave (MW), visible (VIS), and infrared (IR) data. LWP, determined directly from the TMI MW data, is used to define the lower-level cloud properties to select the proper lookup table. The properties of the upper-level ice clouds, such as optical depth and effective size, are then derived using the Visible Infrared Solar-infrared Split-window Technique (VISST), which matches the VIRS IR, 3. 9 - m, and <b>VIS</b> <b>data</b> to the multilayer-cloud lookup table reflectances and a set of emittance parameterizations. Initial comparisons with surface-based radar retrievals suggest that this enhanced MCRS can significantly improve the accuracy and decrease the IWP in overlapped clouds by 42 % and 13 % compared to using the single-layer VISST and an earlier simplified MW-VIS-IR (MVI) differencing method, respectively, for ice-over-water cloud systems. The tropical distribution of ice-over-water clouds is the same as derived earlier from combined TMI and VIRS data, but the new values of IWP and optical depth are slightly larger than the older MVI values, and exceed those of single-layered layered clouds by 7 % and 11 %, respectively. The mean IWP from the MCRS is 8 - 14 % greater than that retrieved from radar retrievals of overlapped clouds over two surface sites and the standard deviations of the differences are similar to those for single-layered clouds. Examples of a method for applying the MCRS over land without microwave data yield similar differences with the surface retrievals. By combining the MCRS with other techniques that focus primarily on optically thin cirrus over low water clouds, {{it will be possible to}} more fully assess the IWP in all conditions over ocean except for precipitating systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Modern {{gene therapy}} methods have limited control over where a {{therapeutic}} viral vector inserts into the host genome. Vector integration can activate local gene expression, {{which can cause}} cancer if the vector inserts near an oncogene. Viral integration hot-spots or 'common insertion sites' (CIS) are scrutinized to evaluate and predict patient safety. CIS are typically defined by a minimum density of insertions (such as 2 - 4 within a 30 - 100 kb region), which unfortunately depends on {{the total number of}} observed VIS. This is problematic for comparing hot-spot distributions across data sets and patients, where the VIS numbers may vary. Results We develop two new methods for defining hot-spots that are relatively independent of data set size. Both methods operate on distributions of VIS across consecutive 1 Mb 'bins' of the genome. The first method 'z-threshold' tallies the number of VIS per bin, converts these counts to z-scores, and applies a threshold to define high density bins. The second method 'BCP' applies a Bayesian change-point model to the z-scores to define hot-spots. The novel hot-spot methods are compared with a conventional CIS method using simulated data sets and data sets from five published human studies, including the X-linked ALD (adrenoleukodystrophy), CGD (chronic granulomatous disease) and SCID-X 1 (X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency) trials. The BCP analysis of the human X-linked ALD data for two patients separately (774 and 1627 VIS) and combined (2401 VIS) resulted in 5 - 6 hot-spots covering 0. 17 - 0. 251 % of the genome and containing 5. 56 - 7. 74 % of the total VIS. In comparison, the CIS analysis resulted in 12 - 110 hot-spots covering 0. 018 - 0. 246 % of the genome and containing 5. 81 - 22. 7 % of the VIS, corresponding to a greater number of hot-spots as the data set size increased. Our hot-spot methods enable one to evaluate the extent of VIS clustering, and formally compare data sets in terms of hot-spot overlap. Finally, we show that the BCP hot-spots from the repopulating samples coincide with greater gene and CpG island density than the median genome density. Conclusions The z-threshold and BCP methods are useful for comparing hot-spot patterns across data sets of disparate sizes. The methodology and software provided here should enable one to study hot-spot conservation across a variety of <b>VIS</b> <b>data</b> sets and evaluate vector safety for gene therapy trials. </p...|$|E

A 3 -dimensional accelerometer (SensOor; Agis Automatisering BV, Harmelen, the Netherlands) {{has been developed}} that can be attached to ear identification tags. Based {{on the principle that}} behavior can be identified by ear movements, a proprietary model classifies sensor data as “ruminating,” “eating,” “resting,” or “active. ” The objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate this sensor on accuracy and precision. First, a pilot evaluation of agreement between 2 independent observers, recording behavior from 3 cows for a period of approximately 9 h each, was performed. Second, to evaluate the sensor, the behavior of 15 cows was monitored both visually (VIS) and with the sensor (SENS), with approximately 20 h of registration per cow, evenly distributed over a 24 -h period, excluding milking. Cows were chosen from groups of animals in different lactation stages and parities. Each minute of SENS and <b>VIS</b> <b>data</b> was classified into 1 of 9 categories (8 behaviors and 1 transition behavior) and summarized into 4 behavioral groups, namely ruminating, eating, resting, or active, which were analyzed by calculating kappa (¿) values. For the pilot evaluation, a high level of agreement between observers was obtained, with ¿ values of = 0. 96 for all behavioral categories, indicating that visual observation provides a good standard. For the second trial, relationships between SENS and VIS were studied by ¿ values on a minute basis and Pearson correlation and concordance correlation coefficient analysis on behavior expressed as percentage of total registration time. Times spent ruminating, eating, resting, and active were 42. 6, 15. 9, 31. 6, and 9. 9 % (SENS) respectively, and 42. 1, 13. 0, 30. 0, and 14. 9 % (VIS), respectively. Overall ¿ for the comparison of SENS and VIS was substantial (0. 78), with ¿ values of 0. 85, 0. 77, 0. 86, and 0. 47 for “ruminating,” “eating,” “resting,” and “active,” respectively. Pearson correlation and concordance correlation coefficients between SENS and VIS for “ruminating,” “eating,” “resting,” and “active” were 0. 93, 0. 88, 0. 98, and 0. 73, and 0. 93, 0. 75, 0. 97, and 0. 35, respectively. In conclusion, the results provide strong evidence that the present ear sensor technology can be used to monitor ruminating and resting behavior of freestall-housed dairy cattle. Our results also suggest that this technology shows promise for monitoring eating behavior, whereas more work is needed to determine its suitability to monitor activity of dairy cattle...|$|E

The Nighttime Lights of the World data set is compiled from the October 1994 - March 1995 DMSP nighttime data collected when moonlight was low. Using the OLS thermal infrared band, areas containing clouds were removed and the remaining area used in the time series. This animation is derived from an image created by Craig Mayhew and Robert Simmon from data provided by Christopher Elvidge of the NOAA National Geophysical Data Center.

40|$|Visible (VIS, 0. 65 micron) and {{infrared}} (IR, 10. 5 microns) channels on geostationary satellites {{are the key}} elements of the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). All daytime ISCCP cloud parameters are derived {{from a combination of}} <b>VIS</b> and IR <b>data.</b> Validation and improvement of the ISCCP and other cloud retrieval algorithms are important components of the First ISCCP Regional Experiment (FIRE) Intensive Field Observations (IFO). Data from the Cirrus IFO (October 19 to November 2, 1986) over Wisconsin are available for validating cirrus cloud retrievals from satellites. The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) located over the Equator at approximately 100 deg W provided nearly continuous measurements of VIS and IR radiances over the IFO areas. The preliminary results of cloud parameters derived from the IFO GOES data are presented. Cloud attitudes are first derived using an algorithms without corrections for cloud emissivity. These same parameters will then be computed from the same data relying on an emissivity correction algorithm based on correlative data taken during the Cirrus IFO...|$|R
40|$|The {{numerical}} models represent {{very useful}} tools for the simulation of regional flows and may provide several indications as to a rational management and allocation {{of the available}} water resources. The very complex aquifer systems underlying the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region in northeastern Italy, has been analysed {{with the aid of}} two combined models based on the finite element method. The first model simulates the steady flow in the Upper Plain and relies on the Dupit-Forchheimer—Boussinesq approach. The second one simulates the multi-aquifer basin of the Lower Plain and is based on the integro-differential theory of flow. Both models have been run under a series of realistic assumptions properly combined with the limited available information. The results obtained for the dry regime are moderately satisfactory and allow for the first-hand appraisal of the quantity involved in the overall regional groundwater balance. They also point out the need for a substantial improvement in {{the quality and quantity of}} the regional subsurface <b>data</b> <b>vis</b> à vis reliable future predictions in a wider framework of practical interest...|$|R
40|$|For {{visualization}} pedagogy, {{an important}} but challenging notion to teach is design, from making to evaluating visualization encodings, user interactions, or data visualization systems. In our previous work, we introduced the design activity framework to codify the high-level {{activities of the}} visualization design process. This framework has helped structure experts' design processes to create visualization systems, but the framework's four activities lack a breakdown into steps with a concrete example to help novices utilizing this framework in their own real-world design process. To provide students with such concrete guidelines, we created worksheets for each design activity: understand, ideate, make, and deploy. Each worksheet presents a high-level summary of the activity with actionable, guided steps for a novice designer to follow. We validated {{the use of this}} framework and the worksheets in a graduate-level visualization course taught at our university. For this evaluation, we surveyed the class and conducted 13 student interviews to garner qualitative, open-ended feedback and suggestions on the worksheets. We conclude this work with a discussion and highlight various areas for future work on improving visualization design pedagogy.

40|$|Abstract—Method for {{visualization}} of 5 D assimilation data for meteorological forecasting and its related disaster mitigations utilizing Vis 5 D of software tool is proposed. In order to mitigate severe weather related disaster, meteorological forecasting and prediction is needed. There are some numerical weather forecasting data, in particular, assimilation data. Time {{series of three}} dimensional geophysical parameters have to be represented visually onto computer display in a comprehensive manner. On the other hand, there are some visualization software tools. In particular, Vis 5 D of software tool for animation of three dimensional imagery data can be displayed. Through experiments with NCEP/GDAS assimilation data, {{it is found that}} the proposed method is appropriate for representation of 5 D assimilation data in a comprehensive manner. The number of lattice points, the name of geographical map, the name of variables (geophysical parameters), the acquisition time, etc. are attributes of the five dimensional <b>data.</b> <b>Vis</b> 5 D supports two types of data format, v 5 d and comp 5 d formats. Comp 5 d format is old format so that v 5 d format is popular and default format at this time. Figure 1 shows control panel of Vis 5 D while Figure 2 shows manipulating images.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results derived from an archaeometric study undertaken on glass samples from the Roman town of Augusta Emerita (Mérida, Spain). The main goal of the research was {{to provide for the}} first time some compositional and technological insights into the glass finds unearthed in this town. Glass samples from different sites and chronology, either from inside or from outside the perimeter of the ancient town and from the first to the sixth century AD, were analyzed and characterized through optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry and <b>VIS</b> spectrophotometry. Resulting <b>data</b> indicated that all the samples studied were natron-based soda lime silicate glasses, even though two chronological and compositionally distinct groups were distinguished. One composed of Early Empire glasses and a second one composed of glasses from the fourth century AD onward, which was characterized by the presence of the so-called HIMT (high iron, manganese, and titanium) glasses. Comparison with coeval glasses suggested that Augusta Emerita shared the same trade glass circles than other contemporary Roman towns, within the frame of a secondary production scale. Finally, some outstanding differences connected to composition and chronology were found, since Late Roman glasses presented a higher and distinct degree of alteration than Early Empire ones.

40|$|In this Study {{we examine}} the {{spectral}} and morphometric properties of the four important lunar mare dome fields near Cauchy, Arago, Hortensius. and Milichius. We utilize Clementine UV <b>vis</b> mulfispectral <b>data</b> to examine the soil composition of the mare domes while employing telescopic CCD imagery to compute digital elevation maps {{in order to determine}} their morphometric properties, especially flank slope, height, and edifice Volume. After reviewing previous attempts to determine topographic data for lunar domes, we propose an image-based 3 D reconstruction approach which is based on a combination of photoclinometry and shape from shading. Accordingly, we devise a classification scheme for lunar Marc domes which is based on a principal component analysis of the determined spectral and morphometric features. For the effusive mare domes of the examined fields we establish four Classes, two of which are further divided into two subclasses, respectively, where each class represents distinct combinations of spectral and morphometric dome properties. As a general trend, shallow and steep domes formed out of low-TiO 2 basalts are observed in the Hortensius and Milichius dome fields, while the domes near Cauchy and Arago that consist of high-TiO 2 basalts are all very shallow. The intrusive domes of our data set cover a wide continuous range of spectral and morphometric quantities, generally characterized by larger diameters and shallower flank slopes than effusive domes. A comparison to effusive and intrusive mare domes in other lunar regions, highland domes, and lunar cones has shown that the examined four mare dome fields display Such a richness in spectral properties and 3 D dome shape that the established representation remains valid in a more global context. Furthermore, we estimate the physical parameters of dome formation for the examined domes based on a rheologic model. Each class of effusive domes defined in terms of spectral and morphometric properties is characterized by its specific range of values for lava viscosity, effusion rate, and duration of the effusion process. For our data set we report lava viscosities between about 10 (2) and 10 (8) Pas, effusion rates between 25 and 600 m(3) s(- 1), and durations of the effusion process between three weeks and 18 years. Lava viscosity decreases with increasing R- 415 /R- 750 spectral ratio and thus TiO 2 content; however, the correlation is not strong, implying an important influence of further parameters like effusion temperature on lava viscosity...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} aging-related {{differences in}} the contribution of visuomotor correction to force fluctuations during index finger abduction via the analysis of two datasets from similar subjects. Study (1) Young (N = 27, 23 ± 8 years) and older adults (N = 14, 72 ± 9 years) underwent assessment of maximum voluntary contraction force (MVC) and force steadiness during constant-force (CF) index finger abduction (2. 5, 30, 65 % MVC). For each trial, visual feedback of the force (VIS) was provided for 8 – 10 s and removed for 8 – 10 s (NOVIS). Visual gain of the force feedback at 2. 5 % MVC was high; 12 - and 26 -fold greater than the 30 and 65 % MVC targets. Mean force, standard deviation (SD) of force, and coefficient of variation (CV) of force was calculated for detrended (< 0. 5 Hz drift removed) <b>VIS</b> and NOVIS <b>data</b> segments. Study (2) A similar group of 14 older adults performed discrete, randomly-ordered VIS or NOVIS trials at low target forces (1 – 3 % MVC) and high visual gain. Study (1) For young adults the CV of force was similar between VIS and NOVIS for the 2. 5 % (4. 8 vs. 4. 3 %), 30 % (3. 2 vs. 3. 2 %) and 65 % (3. 5 vs. 4. 2 %) target forces. In contrast, for older adults the CV of force was greater for VIS than NOVIS for 2. 5 % MVC (6. 6 vs. 4. 2 %, p < 0. 001), {{but not for the}} 30 % (2. ...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{analyses}} of satellite data {{have been limited}} to interpreting the radiances in terms of single layer clouds. Generally, this results in significant errors in the retrieved properties for multilayered cloud systems. Two techniques for detecting overlapped clouds and retrieving the cloud properties using satellite data are explored to help address the need for better quantification of cloud vertical structure. The first technique was developed using multispectral imager data with secondary imager products (infrared brightness temperature differences, BTD). The other method uses microwave (MWR) data. The use of BTD, the 11 - 12 micrometer brightness temperature difference, in conjunction with tau, the retrieved visible optical depth, was suggested by Kawamoto et al. (2001) and used by Pavlonis et al. (2004) {{as a means to}} detect multilayered clouds. Combining visible (VIS; 0. 65 micrometer) and infrared (IR) retrievals of cloud properties with microwave (MW) retrievals of cloud water temperature Tw and liquid water path LWP retrieved from satellite microwave imagers appears to be a fruitful approach for detecting and retrieving overlapped clouds (Lin et al., 1998, Ho et al., 2003, Huang et al., 2005). The BTD method is limited to optically thin cirrus over low clouds, while the MWR method is limited to ocean areas only. With the availability of <b>VIS</b> and IR <b>data</b> from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and MW data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer EOS (AMSR-E), both on Aqua, it is now possible to examine both approaches simultaneously.
