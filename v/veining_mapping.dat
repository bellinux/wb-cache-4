40|$|B-mode {{ultrasound}} was prospectively {{evaluated for}} its ability to preoperatively assess the adequacy of venous conduit for arterial reconstruction. Fifty-one patients who had lower extremity revascularization had real-time imaging of the saphenous and cephalic veins. Veins were judged adequate based on size, compressibility, and absence of sclerosis or intraluminal echoes. All <b>mapped</b> <b>veins</b> were explored and assessed by the standard criteria for suitability. Vein size was determined from completion angiograms, and wound complications recorded and compared with patients who had similar procedures in the 12 months before the use of <b>vein</b> <b>mapping.</b> Preoperative mapping was found to be accurate in 50 to 51 patients (98 %). Vein size as determined by B-mode ultrasound correlated well with angiograms, R = 0. 8539 overall with R greater than 0. 9 in the last 7 months of the study. Wound complications occurred in 2 % of the patients who had preoperative mapping and in 17 % of the historic controls. Preoperative <b>vein</b> <b>mapping</b> using B-mode ultrasound is an accurate method of determining vein suitability for use in arterial reconstruction. It improves operative planning and can contribute to a reduction in wound complications. Veins determined to be unusable by preoperative scanning need not be explored...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveLower {{extremity}} {{computed tomography}} angiography (CTA) is frequently used for anatomic assessment of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease. When lower extremity bypass is planned, duplex ultrasound (DUS) is routinely obtained {{to evaluate the}} great saphenous vein (GSV) for use as conduit. Although GSV can be visualized on CTA images, diameter assessment is not routinely included in formal study interpretation. We hypothesized that CTA images {{could be used to}} measure GSV diameters and that CTA-based diameters would correlate with measurements obtained using DUS. MethodsConsecutive patients undergoing lower extremity arterial bypass who were evaluated preoperatively with both CTA and DUS <b>vein</b> <b>mapping</b> were identified at a single hospital. Minimum above- and below-knee GSV diameters were measured from electronically archived CTA images by two independent observers. CTAs were performed using standard arterial phase protocol without additional venous phase imaging. Between-observer reproducibility of CTA-based diameter measurements was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients. Correlation between CTA and DUS-based GSV diameters was evaluated with Spearman correlation coefficients. CTA diameter cut-points for identification of adequate GSV bypass conduit, defined as DUS-based minimum GSV diameter ≥ 3 mm, were determined using receiver-operating characteristic curves. ResultsSixty-three lower extremities were evaluated in 36 patients. In the absence of previous surgical removal, GSV was visible on all CTAs reviewed. No instances of GSV thrombosis were identified on DUS. Minimum DUS-based above-knee GSV diameter was 2. 9 ± 0. 1 mm (range, 1. 4 - 4. 6 mm), and mean below-knee diameter was 2. 6 ± 0. 1 mm (range, 1. 3 - 4. 0 mm). When GSV was visible and exceeded the minimum diameter threshold for CTA measurement, correlation between CTA- and DUS-based diameters was both positive and highly significant (ρ = 0. 595; P <. 0001). CTA-based diameters also had excellent reliability between observers (r [95 % CI]: 0. 88 [0. 85 - 0. 91]). For identification of adequate bypass conduit using CTA, above-knee GSV diameter ≥ 3. 9 mm was 67 % sensitive and 73 % specific; below-knee GSV diameter ≥ 3. 0 mm was 75 % sensitive and 84 % specific. ConclusionsCTA-based GSV diameter measurements have good reproducibility and highly significant correlation with DUS-based diameters. CTA-based GSV diameter is a specific but relatively insensitive indicator of adequate bypass conduit. When CTA-based diameters indicate inadequate GSV bypass conduit, confirmatory DUS <b>vein</b> <b>mapping</b> is warranted. Confirmatory DUS <b>vein</b> <b>mapping</b> may be unnecessary when adequate vein diameter is identified on CTA...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveAutogenous {{arteriovenous}} hemodialysis accesses (arteriovenous fistulas [AVFs]) are preferred {{for chronic}} hemodialysis access. Preoperative <b>vein</b> <b>mapping</b> by duplex ultrasound is recommended before AVF creation, {{but there are}} few data correlating vein diameter with postoperative outcomes. Also, vein diameter has not been included in prior predictive models of fistula maturation. This study aims to test whether preoperative vein diameter is associated with failure of AVF maturation and long-term (secondary) patency. MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of clinical variables of patients undergoing brachiobasilic or brachiocephalic AVF creation. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression models tested whether preoperative minimum vein diameter (MVD) and clinical covariates were associated with failure of AVF maturation and secondary patency. ResultsThe sample included 158 adults (54  ± 14  years; 45 % male; 61 % white; 56 % diabetes; body mass index, 32  ± 8; MVD, 3. 4  ± 1. 1  mm; follow-up, 12  ± 9  months [range, < 1 - 40  months]). Increased MVD was associated with decreased risk of AVF failure. More than one third of AVFs with MVD < 2. 7  mm failed to mature within 6  months. Multivariate models that adjusted for age, diabetes, race, gender, body mass index, and preoperative dialysis status demonstrated that increased MVD was associated with decreased risk of failure of maturation and better long-term patency overall (P =. 005 and P =. 001, respectively). ConclusionsPatients with a larger MVD on preoperative <b>vein</b> <b>mapping</b> are at lower risk for failure of fistula maturation and have increased long-term AVF patency. MVD is the only clinical or demographic factor associated with both AVF maturation and long-term patency.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} Time-resolved MR venography (TR-MRV) of the pulmonary venous circulation using the time-resolved angiography with interleaved stochastic trajectories (TWIST) method of time-resolved MRA (TR-MRA) and compare it with the more commonly used conventional Contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) approach in atrial fibrillation patients referred for pre-ablation pul-monary <b>vein</b> <b>mapping.</b> Background Catheter-based ablation of the pulmonary veins prevents recurrence of atrial fibrillation in 70 - 80 % of patients during the first year of follow-up 1, 2. CE-MRA depicts the left atrium and pulmonary veins with high spatial resolution, enabling accurate measurement of pulmon-ary vein ostia to be made with depiction of their rela-tionship to other structures. 1, 3 Conventional CE-MRA however requires timing of contrast enhancement and produces images with overlap of venous and arterial structures, potentially obscuring pulmonary vein ostia. TR-MRA is an alternative to conventional CE-MRA and has been used successfully in other vascular territories. 4 Such an approach may be particularly advantageous in the pulmonary circulation with its rapid arteriovenous transit time, allowing acquisition of pure pulmonary venous phase images with a simpler imaging protocol. Material and methods 26 patients (15 males; age 60. 0 ± 12. 7 y) referred for pre-ablation pulmonary <b>vein</b> <b>mapping</b> underwent both con-ventional CE-MRA and TR-MRV with TWIST.

The proposed system is a fully automated and it uses a contactless, low-cost near IR imaging device to capture hand vein images. The minutiae points: vein bifurcations and vein endings, are extracted from the hand vein image and along with them knuckle points are used to perform authentication. The matching scores are generated in two stages: (i) hierarchical matching score from the four sets of triplets generated from binarized vein image (ii) the knuckle tip distances and <b>vein</b> <b>map</b> length. The weighted average of the matching scores is used to authenticate an individual.

40|$|ObjectiveIncreasing use {{of primary}} {{arteriovenous}} fistulae (pAVFs) is a desired goal in hemodialysis patients (National Kidney Foundation /Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative guidelines). However, in many instances, pAVFs fail to adequately mature due to ill-defined mechanisms. We therefore investigated pAVFs with color duplex ultrasound (CDU) surveillance 4 to 12 weeks postoperatively to identify hemodynamically significant abnormalities that {{may contribute to}} pAVF failure. MethodsFrom March 2001 to October 2003, 54 upper extremity pAVFs were subjected to CDU assessment before access. A peak systolic velocity ratio (SVR) of ≥ 2 : 1 was used to detect ≥ 50 % stenosis involving arterial inflow and venous outflow, whereas an SVR of ≥ 3 : 1 was used to detect ≥ 50 % anastomotic stenosis. CDU findings were compared with preoperative <b>vein</b> <b>mapping</b> and postoperative fistulography when available. ResultsOf 54 pAVFs, there were 23 brachiocephalic, 14 radiocephalic, and 17 basilic vein transpositions. By CDU surveillance, 11 (20 %) were occluded and 14 (26 %) were negative. Twenty-nine (54 %) pAVFs had 38 hemodynamically significant CDU abnormalities. These included 16 (42 %) venous outflow, 13 (34 %) anastomotic, and 2 (5 %) inflow stenoses. In seven (18 %), branch steal with reduced flow was found. In 35 of 54 (65 %) pAVFs, preoperative <b>vein</b> <b>mapping</b> was available and demonstrated adequate vein size (≥ 3 mm) and outflow in 86 % of cases. Twenty-one fistulograms (38 %) were available for verifying the CDU abnormalities. In each fistulogram, the arterial inflow, anastomosis, and venous outflow were compared with the CDU findings (63 segments). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CDU in detecting pAVF stenoses ≥ 50 % were 93 %, 94 %, was 97 %, respectively. ConclusionsBefore initiation of hemodialysis, an unexpectedly high prevalence of critical stenoses was found in patent pAVFs using CDU surveillance. These de novo stenoses appear to develop rapidly after arterialization of the upper extremity superficial veins and can be reliably detected by CDU surveillance. Turbulent flow conditions in pAVFs {{may play a role}} in inducing progressive vein wall and valve leaflet intimal thickening, although stenoses may be due to venous abnormalities that predate AVF placement. Routine CDU surveillance of pAVFs should be considered to identify and correct flow-limiting stenoses that may compromise pAVF long-term patency and use...|$|R

Methods: In all, 355 consecutive vein mappings were retrospectively analyzed. A generalized estimating equations approach to linear logistic regres-sion {{was used to evaluate}} the variables. Results: Among the 312 vein ablation of the GSV, 10 (3. 2 %) developed EHIT. When comparing the group of patients who developed EHIT versus no EHIT, the mean GSV diameter was 13. 05 + 5. 59 mm versus 8. 39 + 3. 38 mm (odds ratio [OR]: 1. 25, P. 001), the presence of valvular incompetence at the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) was 10. 71 % versus 0. 44 % (OR: 27. 75, P. 001), and 3. 09 % in RFA versus 3. 33 % in EVLT (OR: 1. 09, P. 89).

40|$|Multiple {{superficial}} {{veins in}} different anatomical configurations {{exist in the}} elbow. The resulting variety of elbow arteriovenous fistulae (AVFs) is described in this paper. A classification of elbow AVF in nontransposed AVF, transposed AVF and multiple outflow AVF is proposed. The nontransposed brachiocephalic AVF has the lowest primary failure rate and a good medium-term survival particularly in the elderly. The simplest technique is an end-to-side anastomosis of the median cubital vein to the brachial artery. In cases of small upper arm veins, a perforating vein AVF, using multiple outflow tracts, {{may be helpful to}} lower primary failure risk. In the era of <b>vein</b> <b>mapping</b> with portable ultrasound elbow AVF should be made when forearm veins are exhausted or too small. A side-to-side AVF in order to enhance retrograde flow in the median forearm vein seems rarely indicated, in particular considering the greater risk of steal and venous hypertension.

There is conflicting evidence of the benefits of one-stage versus two-stage procedures. Therefore, the type of operation should be tailored to the individual patient...|$|R

30|$|Although {{pulmonary}} {{arteries and}} veins are commonly imaged without {{the assistance of}} electrocardiographically (ECG) gated imaging (MR or CT), in certain circumstances cardiac gating can improve the visualisation of the central pulmonary vasculature. For example, ECG-gating assists in the detailed imaging of the pulmonary vein ostia that is required {{in the setting of}} pulmonary <b>vein</b> <b>mapping</b> for pre-ablation imaging and in pre-procedure pulmonic valve replacement planning [2]. Imaging of the pulmonary vasculature is improved using a dedicated angiographic technique in which the timing of the contrast bolus is targeted to the vessel or structure of interest. This is commonly achieved using either a test bolus to determine peak enhancement or a bolus-tracking method to determine when the level of enhancement begins to increase in a structure of interest. For imaging of pulmonary arteries, the main pulmonary artery will be the target structure and for imaging of the pulmonary veins, the left atrium will be the target structure. A contrast flow rate of at least 3  cc/s is recommended {{to reduce the risk of}} insufficient enhancement of the target structure. The volume of contrast and duration of scan time needed for imaging will depend on the type of scanner used (e.g. dual source or 16 / 64 / 256 -slice multidetector CT), with faster scanners decreasing scan time and amount of contrast volume needed [4].|$|R

We present the early and long-term results of a focal approach to pulmonary-vein ablation for cure of paroxysmal AF. Aims: The {{aim of this study}} was to establish the effectiveness of focal pulmonary vein radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for cure of paroxysmal AF. Methods: Fifty-one consecutive patients (35 male; 45 ± 11. 4 years) were considered for RFA on the following criteria: (i) symptomatic drug refractory AF, (ii) high-density atrial ectopy, bursts of atrial tachycardia or AF, (iii) absence of structural heart disease and (iv) provision of informed consent. Pulmonary <b>vein</b> <b>mapping</b> and RFA were by single trans-septal puncture, which was only performed in patients with adequate focal activity at the time of procedure. Focal activity was present spontaneously or was elicited by isoprenaline, burst pacing or AF induction and cardio­version. Results: One patient was excluded from the analysis due to non-pulmonary <b>vein</b> triggers. Trans-septal <b>mapping</b> and RFA were not performed in 22 patients (44 %) due to: (i) inadequate ectopy (17), (ii) recur­rent AF (1), (iii) inability to cross septum (2) and (iv) multiple foci (2). Of 28 patients, RFA was attempted with procedural success in 23 patients (82 %), with no acute complications. Mean fluoro-­ scopy time for patients having RFA was 29 ± 11. 5 mins. Pulmonary vein stenosis occurred in one case. Ten patients had symptomatic recurrence and, of those, two had further RFA. At a mean follow up of 11 ± 8 months, 15 patients (54 % ablated, 30 % of the total cohort) remained free of AF without anti-arrhythmics. Conclusion: This series highlights the low long-term success rate of RFA to cure AF by targeting pulmon­ary vein initiators using a focal approach.

Data on operative details, morbidity, hospital stay, and graft patency were collected prospectively and compared. All patients were followed up for 12 months. RESULTS: The group that underwent angioscopy (A) and the control group (B) were similar in all respects, except {{for the number of}} patients enrolled in the groups (32 and 69, respectively). Angioscopy revealed incompletely destructed valves in 34 patients (range, 0 to 5; mean 1), undiagnosed vein branches in 111 patients (mean 4. 3), and partly occluding thrombus in 5 patients.

Conclusions: Angioscopic assistance has an impact on primary graft patency, minimizes the risk for graft failure and thus reduces the need for reintervention by allowing identification of persistent saphenous vein branches, incomplete valve destruction, and partly occluding graft thrombus without adding extra operative time.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the prevalence, distribution {{and extent of}} phlebosclerosis in an outpatient population referred to vascular clinic. Design: Prospective cohort study. Patients and Methods: Seven hundred and forty consecutive patients, 302 (41 %) men with a cohort median age of 49 (range, 18 - 84), were referred to the vascular clinic for detection of lower extremity acute or chronic venous disease. A total of 1000 limbs were assessed using duplex ultrasonography. Deep veins were not assessed. Characteristics of venous wall and lumen were studied. Phlebosclerosis was diagnosed based on the increased echogenicity and thickness or calcification of the venous wall. Patients with known trauma or any surgery in the lower extremities were excluded. Two control groups were used for comparison, one of consecutive patients undergoing <b>vein</b> <b>mapping</b> (n = 100) and the other of younger volunteers free of any vein disease (n = 25). Results: Of the 1000 limbs (right: 458, left: 542) studied by duplex ultrasound, 21 limbs had intense brightness of the venous wall. Fifteen of them had also calcifications and 61 wall thickening. The prevalence of phlebosclerosis was significantly higher in the patient group when compared with control groups 1 (P = 0. 019) and 2 (P = 0. 011). The mean age of patients with phlebosclerosis was higher compared with the whole patient group (57 versus 49 years, P < 0. 0001). Phlebosclerosis affected all superficial veins with greater prevalence in the small saphenous vein (SSV). The mean length of the phlebosclerotic lesion was 2 cm (range 1 - 7 cm). Conclusion: The prevalence of phlebosclerosis in the lower extremities appears to be low with no significant sex differences. Age and chronic venous disease are important factors for its development. It may {{be present in the}} absence of thrombosis or reflux. A greater prevalence of phlebosclerotic lesions was found in the SSV...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIRock {{masses of}} the primary copper ore at the El Teniente mine fail mainly through the infill of preexisting veins during the caving processes, {{especially}} through those composed of less than 35 % hard minerals (quartz and pyrite). In this study, the Synthetic Rock Mass (SRM) approach is used to reproduce the results of ten uniaxial compression tests on veined core-size samples of El Teniente Mafic Complex (CMET) lithology, from El Teniente mine, Codelco-Chile. At {{the scale of the}} tested samples it is observed that veins composed mostly of quartz dominate the failure process. The developed methodology considers generating a deterministic Discrete Fracture Network (DEN) based on the <b>veins</b> <b>mapped</b> at the surface of each core sample. Then, the micro-parameters of the Bonded Particle Model (BPM) are calibrated to represent the macro-parameters of the average block of intact rock within all samples. Next, the micro-parameters of the Smooth-Joint Contact Model (SJCM), which represent the mechanical properties of veins, are calibrated to reproduce the stress-strain curves and the failure modes of the veined coresize samples measured during the laboratory tests. Results show that the SRM approach is able to reproduce the behavior of the veined rock samples under uniaxial loading conditions. The strength and stiffness of veins, as well as the vein network, have an important impact on the deformability and global strength of the synthetic samples. Contrary to what was observed in the laboratory tests, synthetic samples failed mainly through weak veins. This result is expected in the modeling given that anhydrite veins are considered weaker than quartz veins. Further research is required to completely understand the impact of veins on the behavior of rock masses.

40|$|ObjectiveAlthough duplex <b>vein</b> <b>mapping</b> (DVM) of {{the great}} saphenous vein (GSV) is common practice, there is no level I {{evidence}} for its application. Our prospective randomized trial studied the effect of preoperative DVM in infrainguinal bypass surgery. MethodsConsecutive patients undergoing primary bypass grafting were prospectively randomized for DVM of the GSV (group A) or no DMV of the GSV (group B) before surgery. Society for Vascular Surgery reporting standards were applied. ResultsFrom December 2009 to December 2010, 103 patients were enrolled: 51 (group A) underwent DVM of the GSV, and 52 (group B) did not. Group A and group B not differ statistically in age (72. 8 vs 71. 1 years), sex (women, 29. 4 % vs 34. 6 %), cardiovascular risk factors, body mass index (25. 9 vs 26. 1 kg/m 2), bypass anatomy, and runoff. Group A and B had equal operative time (151. 4 vs 151. 1 minutes), incisional length (39. 4 vs 39. 9 cm), and secondary bypass patency at 30 days (96. 1 % vs 96. 2 %; P =. 49). Conduit issues resulted in six intraoperative changes of the operative plan in group B vs none in group A (P =. 014). Median postoperative length of stay was comparable in both groups (P =. 18). Surgical site infections (SSIs) were classified (in group A vs B) as minor (23. 5 % vs 23. 1 %; P = 1. 0) and major (1. 9 % vs 21. 2 %; P =. 004). Readmissions due to SSIs were 3. 9 % in group A vs 19. 2 % in group B (P =. 028). Two patients in group B died after complications of SSIs. Multivariate analysis identified preoperative DVM as the only significant factor influencing the development of major SSI (P =. 0038). ConclusionsRoutine DVM should be recommended for infrainguinal bypass surgery. The study found that preoperative DVM significantly avoids unnecessary surgical exploration, development of major SSI, and reduces frequency of readmissions for SSI treatment...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesDuplex {{ultrasonography}} {{assessment of}} superficial forearm veins is frequently used before a hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is created. There is, however, no standardized preoperative duplex ultrasonography protocol. This study assessed B-mode image analysis reproducibility and reproducibility of repeated forearm superficial venous diameter measurements on different days at different venous congestion pressures (VCPs). MethodsDiameters were determined using B-mode ultrasonography in 10 healthy male volunteers on days 1 and 14 at incremental VCP values (10 to 80 mm Hg). Intra- and interobserver agreement was assessed for B-mode image analysis by calculating interclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Reproducibility of repeated diameter measurements (maximum and minimum diameter at days 1 and 14), cross-sectional area size increase, and shape change due to incremental VCPs {{were determined by}} calculating ICC values. ResultsAnalysis of intraobserver agreement of B-mode image interpretation yielded ICC values of 0. 97 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 94 to 0. 99) and 0. 97 (95 % CI, 0. 96 to 0. 99) for determination of maximum and minimum diameters, respectively. Interobserver agreement analysis yielded ICC values of 0. 95 (95 % CI, 0. 92 to 0. 97) and 0. 96 (95 % CI, 0. 96 to 0. 99) for determination of maximum and minimum diameters, respectively. Reproducibility of repeated diameter measurements on days 1 and 14 improved substantially at incremental VCP values, with best reproducibility at VCPs > 40 mm Hg. Repeated determination of cross-sectional area size increase and shape change due to VCP increase from 10 to 80 mm Hg yielded ICC values of 0. 49 (95 % CI, 0. 19 to 1. 00) and 0. 09 (95 % CI, 0. 00 to 0. 92), respectively. Maximum and minimum diameters as well as cross-sectional area size increased significantly (P 40 mm Hg to attain the best reproducibility.

40|$|ObjectivesPreoperative duplex {{ultrasound}} <b>mapping</b> of <b>veins</b> and arteries {{has been}} widely advocated to maximize the creation of native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) for hemodialysis access, but reliable diameter criteria have not been established. We sought to determine patient and anatomic variables predictive of fistula maturation in patients receiving their initial permanent hemodialysis access. MethodsAll patients undergoing dialysis access creation from January 2003 to June 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. We analyzed fistula type and functional maturation rates (Society for Vascular Surgery [SVS] reporting standards) based on patient characteristics and findings on physical examination, preoperative <b>vein</b> <b>mapping</b> studies, or venography. Maturation and patency rates were determined by Kaplan Meier analysis. The following factors were analyzed: age, race, gender, body-mass index (BMI), fistula site, preoperative duplex vein diameter, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, HTN, prior central catheter placement, HIV, and history of IV drug abuse. ResultsFrom January 2003 to June 2007, 298 vascular access procedures were performed. One hundred ninety-five (65 %) were initial hemodialysis access procedures, among which a native AVF was created in 185 (95 %); 158 patients with posterior radiocephalic AVF (PRCAVF, n = 24), wrist radiocephalic AVF (WRCAVF, n = 72), or brachiocephalic AVF (BCAVF, n = 62) had adequate follow-up and {{were included in the}} analysis. PRCAVF, WRCAVF, and BCAVF had 54 %, 66 %, and 81 % maturation rates, respectively. Both the type of fistula type (P =. 032) and vein size (P =. 002) significantly affected maturation by univariate analysis. In contrast, by multivariate logistic regression analysis, vein diameter was the sole independent predictor of fistula functional maturation (P =. 002). ConclusionIn this series of 158 patients undergoing initial hemodialysis access creation, native AVF creation was performed in 95 %. In contrast to previous reports, age, gender, diabetes, and BMI had no significant effect on functional maturation. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, vein diameter was the sole independent predictor of functional fistula maturation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: Angioaccess for {{hemodialysis}} in an extremity with disadvantaged venous outflow {{has reduced}} long-term patency. We hypothesized that arteriovenous bridge graft patency {{could be improved}} in patients with disadvantaged venous outflow by preoperative venous duplex mapping. Methods: The charts of 114 patients who underwent 115 prosthetic arteriovenous bridge grafts were reviewed. Disadvantaged venous outflow was defined {{on the basis of}} any combination of prior arteriovenous bridge graft, multiple venipunctures, and clinical examination. Patients were grouped according to {{the presence or absence of}} disadvantaged venous outflow. Three groups were analyzed: those with normal venous outflow who had an initial arteriovenous bridge graft (NML), those with disadvantaged venous outflow who had only a clinical examination before redo arteriovenous bridge graft (REDO/DVO), and those with disadvantaged venous outflow who underwent preoperative duplex scanning venous evaluation (MAP/DVO). Life table primary and secondary 12 -month patency rates were compared by means of log-rank analysis. Results: Life table analysis yielded 6 -month primary patency rates of 65. 9 % ± 5. 7 %, 66. 4 % ± 7. 3 %, and 43. 8 % ± 10. 9 % for NML, MAP/DVO, and REDO/DVO, respectively. The secondary patency rates at 6 months for NML (91. 9 % ± 3. 4 %) and MAP/DVO (91. 1 % ± 4. 9 %) were statistically equivalent, and both were significantly better than the patency for REDO/DVO (75. 0 % ± 10. 0 %; P =. 004 and P =. 04, respectively). This trend persisted beyond 12 months. Conclusion: Preoperative evaluation of venous anatomy in patients with disadvantaged venous outflow results in an arteriovenous bridge graft patency comparable to that seen in patients undergoing initial arteriovenous bridge grafts. <b>Vein</b> <b>mapping</b> improves arteriovenous bridge graft durability in the patient with disadvantaged venous outflow by allowing the surgeon to select venous return that is in direct continuity with the central venous system.

40|$|There {{were not}} any {{clear-cut}} criteria available {{for clinical use}} of cardiac CT-angiography (CCTA) up to October 2006 in which the American College of Car-diology (ACC), American College of Radiology (ACR) and six other medical institutions released a joint consensus on clinical indications of cardiac CT and MRI. A statement was released by the American Heart Association together with two other radiology and cardiology institutions in the same month on the same matter. An illustrated review will be presented on the newly accepted indications of cardiac CT, especially CCTA. Some prominent indications are as follow: 1. Evaluation of chest pain syndrome in patient with intermediate pretest probability of coronary artery disease (CAD) when exercise test is not feasible. 2. Evaluation of acute chest pain in patient with in-termediate pretest probability of CAD and negative ECG and enzymes. 3. Uninterpretable or equivocal stress test (exercise, perfusion scan, or stress echo). 4. Evaluation of coronary arteries in patients with new onset heart failure. 5. Assessment of congenital coronary and cardiac anomalies. 6. Noninvasive coronary <b>vein</b> <b>mapping</b> prior to placement of biventricular pacemaker. 7. Noninvasive coronary arterial mapping, including internal mammary artery prior to repeat cardiac sur-gical revascularization. Some recent research indicated that CCTA is useful in some other specific situations too, like evaluating in-stent re-stenosis for stainless steel or cobalt stents more than 3 mm in diameter and has also some roles {{in the evaluation of}} coronary bypass grafts, etc. Fi-nally, the newer progressions in the field of multislice CT are promising of even better performance which may widen the scope of its indications. Dual-source CT scanners have shown better performance com-pared with 64 -slice CT scanners in the preliminary studies, namely slice-thickness of 0. 25 mm vs. 0. 4 mm, temporal resolution of 83 ms vs. 165 ms, assessable segments of 98. 6 % vs. 97 %, sensitivity in detection of significant stenosis of 96. 4 % vs. 92 % and specificity of 97. 5 vs. 94 %...|$|R
