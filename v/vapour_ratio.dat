The water vapour profiles measured during night-time by the Raman lidar and radiosondes are compared and the differences between the methodologies are discussed. Then, a new approach to obtain relative humidity profiles by combination of simultaneous profiles of temperature (retrieved from a microwave radiometer) and water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio</b> (from a Raman lidar) is addressed. In the last part of this work, a statistical analysis of water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio</b> and relative humidity profiles obtained during 1 year of simultaneous measurements is presented...|$|R

Measurements of higher-order moments of the turbulent fluctuations of water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio</b> and temperature are obtained based on the application of spectral and auto-covariance analyses to the water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio</b> and temperature time series.

Systematic discrepancies among in situ water vapour instruments have been observed at low water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratios</b> ( 3 ) with the measurement of frost point temperature, and consequently the water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio,</b> determined by CMH under conditions representative of operation in the UT/LS. No detectable interference in the measured frost point temperature was found for HNO 3 mixing ratios of up to 4 ppb for exposure times up to 150 min. HNO 3 was observed to co-condense on the mirror frost, with the adsorbed mass increasing linearly with time at constant exposure levels. Over the duration of a typical balloon sonde ascent (90 – 120 min), the maximum accumulated HNO 3 amounts were comparable to monolayer coverage of the geometric mirror surface area, which corresponds to {{only a small fraction}} of the actual frost layer surface area. This small amount of co-condensed HNO 3 is consistent with the observed lack of HNO 3 interference in the frost point measurement because the CMH utilizes significant reductions (> 10 %) in surface reflectivity by the condensate to determine H 2 O...|$|R
40|$|A UV Raman {{lidar system}} (BASIL) is {{operational}} at DIFA-Univ. of Basilicata (Potenza-Italy). The major feature of BASIL is its capability to perform high-resolution and accurate measurements of atmospheric temperature, both in daytime and night-time, {{based on the}} application of the rotational Raman lidar technique in the UV [1]. Besides temperature, BASIL is capable to provide measurements of particle backscatter at 355 and 532 nm, particle extinction at 355 nm, particle depolarization at 355 and water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio.</b> Relative humidity (RH) measurements are obtained from simultaneous water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio</b> and temperature measurements. These parameters represents a suitable ensemble of measurements for the study of meteorological processes. Specific case studies are considered and discussed to assess RH lidar measurement capability in presence of aerosols and clouds. Measurements of aerosol backscatter as a function of relative humidity are illustrated, highlighting the swelling tendency of hygroscopic aerosol for large relative humidity values (in excess of 80 %). Relative humidity measurements in the proximity and within cirrus clouds are also illustrated and discussed. Both ice super-saturation and undersaturation conditions are found inside these clouds, but air is observed to be always under-saturated with respect to water. The sublimation of the precipitating ice crystals in cirrus clouds is found to cause upper tropospheric humidification, and lead to increased relative humidity values beneath the clouds...|$|R

Curtains composed of lidar profiles beneath the aircraft show the vertical and horizontal distribution and variability of water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio</b> and backscatter ratio above Germany. Two missions on 3 and 4 November 2010 were selected to derive the water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio</b> inside cirrus clouds from the lidar instrument. A good agreement was found with in situ observations performed on a second research aircraft flying below HALO. ECMWF analysis temperature data are used to derive relative humidity fields with respect to ice (RHi) {{inside and outside of}} cirrus clouds from the lidar water vapour observations. The RHi variability is dominated by small-scale fluctuations in the water vapour fields while the temperature variation has a minor impact. The most frequent in-cloud RHi value from lidar observations is 98 %. The RHi variance is smaller inside the cirrus than outside of the cloud. 2 -D histograms of relative humidity and backscatter ratio show significant differences for in-cloud and out-of-cloud situations for two different cirrus cloud regimes. Combined with accurate temperature measurements, the lidar observations have a great potential for detailed statistical cirrus cloud and related humidity studies...|$|R
40|$|Higher-order moments, minima and maxima of {{turbulent}} {{temperature and}} water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio</b> probability density functions measured with an eddy-covariance system near the ground {{were related to}} each other and to vertical boundary-layer profiles of the same scalars obtained through airborne soundings. The dependence of kurtosis on squared skewness showed a kurtosis intercept below the Gaussian expectation, suggesting a compression of the probability density function by the presence of natural boundaries. This hypothesis was corroborated by comparing actual minima and maxima of turbulent fluctuations to estimates obtained from the first four sample moments by fitting a four-parameter beta distribution. The most sharply defined boundaries were found for the minima of temperature datasets during the day, indicating that negative temperature fluctuations at the sensor are limited by the availability of lower temperatures in the boundary layer. By comparison to vertical profiles, it could be verified that the turbulent minimum of temperature near the ground is close to the minimum of potential temperature in the boundary layer. The turbulent minimum of water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio</b> was found to be equal to the mixing ratio at a height above the minimum of the temperature profile. This height roughly agrees with the top of the non-local unstable domain according to bulk Richardson number profiles. We conclude that turbulence statistics measured near the surface cannot be solely explained by local effects, but contain information about the whole boundary layer including the entrainment zone...|$|R

The purpose of this calibration campaign is to insure that PCL water vapour measurements are of sufficient quality for use in scientific investigations of atmo- spheric change, and {{to be included in}} the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Climate Change (NDACC) data base. The detection of long term changes in water vapour concentra- tion, particularly in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) is an issue of pressing scientific, ecological and societal concern. The field campaign took place at the University of Western Ontario Environmental Re- search Field Station, near London Ontario Canada, from May 23 rd to June 10 th 2012 and resulted in 57 hours of measurements taken over 12 clear nights. On each night a minimum of one RS 92 radiosonde was launched. In addition 3 cryogenic frost-point hygrometer (CFH) sondes were launched on clear nights over the course of the campaign. Measurements were obtained from near the surface up to ∼ 20 km by both lidar systems, the radiosondes, and the CFH balloons. These measurements will be used to calibrate profiles of water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio</b> by the newly relocated PCL. Comparisons between measurements of water <b>vapour</b> mass mixing <b>ratio</b> taken by RS 92 ra- diosondes, Cryogenic Frostpoint Hygometers, and the ALVICE and PCL lidars has resulted in the derivation of a system calibration factor of ξ sys = 0. 7545.

40|$|International audienceWater vapour {{measurements}} from {{a ground-based}} Raman lidar and an airborne differential absorption lidar, complemented by high resolution numerical simulations from two mesoscale models (AROME-WMED and Meso-NH), {{are considered to}} investigate three transition events from Mistral/Tramontane to southerly marine flow {{taking place in the}} Montpellier region (Southern France) in the time frame September-October 2012, during the Hydrological Cycle in the Mediterranean Experiment Special Observation Period 1. Low-level wind reversals associated with these transitions are found to have a strong impact on water vapour transport, leading to a large variability of the water vapour vertical and horizontal distributions. Water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio</b> within the boundary layer is found to vary from typical values in the range 4 – 8 [*]g[*]kg− 1 during the northerly Mistral/Tramontane flows to values in the range 8 – 15 [*]g[*]kg− 1 during the southerly marine flows. The increase/decrease in water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio</b> within the boundary layer may be abrupt and marked during these transition periods, with values increasing-decreasing by a factor of 2 to 4 within 1 hour. The high spatial and temporal resolutions of the lidar data allow monitoring the time evolution of the water vapour field during these transitions from predominantly northerly Mistral/Tramontane flow to a predominantly southerly flow, permitting to identify the quite sharp separation between these flows, which is also satisfactorily well captured by the mesoscale models. Water vapour measurements from the ground-based lidar are complemented by particle backscatter measurements from the same system, which allow also revealing the significant variability in the aerosol and cloud fields associated with these transition events...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the possibility for}} a theoretical approach in the estimation of water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratios</b> {{in the vicinity of}} polar mesospheric clouds (PMC) using satellite observations of Volume Scattering Radiances (VSR) obtained at the wavelength of 553 nm. The PMC scattering properties perturb the underlying molecular Rayleigh scattered solar radiance of the background atmosphere. As a result, the presence of PMC leads to an enhancement in the observed VSR at the altitude of the layer; the PMC VSRs are superimposed on the exponentially decreasing with height Rayleigh VSR, of the PMC-free atmosphere. The ratio between the observed and the Rayleigh VSR of the background atmosphere is used to simulate the environment in which the cloud layer is formed. In addition, a microphysical model of ice particle formation is employed to predict the PMC VSRs. The initial water vapour profile is perturbed until the modelled VSRs match the observed, at which point the corresponding temperature and water vapour profiles can be considered as a first approximation of those describing the atmosphere {{at the time of the}} observations. The role of temperature and water vapour in the cloud formation is examined by a number of sensitivity tests suggesting that the water vapour plays a dominant role in the cloud formation in agreement with experimental results. The estimated water vapour profiles are compared with independent observations to examine the model capability in the context of this study. The results obtained are in a good agreement at the peak of the PMC layer although the radiance rapidly decreases with height below the peak. This simplified scenario indicates that the technique employed can give a first approximation estimate of the water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio,</b> giving rise to the VSR observed in the presence of PMC...|$|R
40|$|Variations {{of stable}} water {{isotopes}} in water vapour have become measurable at a measurement frequency of about 1 Hz {{in recent years}} using novel laser spectroscopic techniques. This enables us to perform continuous measurements for process-based investigations of the atmospheric water cycle at the time scales relevant for synoptic and mesoscale meteorology. An important prerequisite for the interpretation of data from automated field measurements lasting for several weeks or months is a detailed knowledge about instrument properties and the sources of measurement uncertainty. We present here a comprehensive characterisation and comparison study of two commercial laser spectroscopic systems based on cavity ring-down spectroscopy (Picarro) and off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy (Los Gatos Research). The uncertainty components of the measurements were first assessed in laboratory experiments, focussing {{on the effects of}} (i) water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio,</b> (ii) measurement stability, (iii) uncertainties due to calibration and (iv) response times of the isotope measurements due to adsorption-desorption processes on the tubing and measurement cavity walls. Based on the experience from our laboratory experiments, we set up a one-week field campaign for comparing measurements of the ambient isotope signals from the two laser spectroscopic systems. The optimal calibration strategy determined for both instruments was applied as well as the correction functions for water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio</b> effects. The root mean square difference between the isotope signals from the two instruments during the field deployment was 2. 3 ‰ for δ 2 H, 0. 5 ‰ for δ 18 O and 3. 1 ‰ for deuterium excess. These uncertainty estimates from field measurements compare well to those found in the laboratory experiments.

40|$|A {{frost point}} {{hygrometer}} {{is described in}} this thesis which uses surface acoustic waves (SAWs) to detect water vapour condensation. The SAW device crystal is cooled by a thermoelectric cooler until condensation occurs, at which point, water vapour loading onto the SAW device causes changes in the SAW velocity and amplitude. Two methods of determining the frost point temperature are outlined in this thesis. The first uses a feedback loop algorithm to maintain a constant amount of water vapour on the SAW device and hence keep {{the temperature of the}} device at the frost point. The second uses heating and cooling cycles to oscillate the SAW device temperature above and below the frost paint. Changes in the SAW properties are then used to detect the condensation-evaporation equilibrium point which is equal to the frost point. The use of SAWs rather than a conventional optical detection system in this hygrometer allows a faster response time, increased sensitivity, and decreased risk of contamination. Between September 2001 and February 2004, the SAW hygrometer was flown on 28 balloon flights, in various configurations. All of these flight data sets show agreement with radiosonde relative humidity measurements to within 1 %, using given criteria for extraction of reliable SAW hygrometer measurements. Accurate lower and mid tropospheric measurements have been made on each flight and four flights show accurate upper tropospheric and lower stratospheric measurements with water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio</b> values of less than 5 ppmv. The Hibiscus campaign flights in Bauru, Brazil, show excellent agreement between the different instruments measuring water vapour on the flight train and the SAW hygrometer. These data are discussed in conjunction with auxiliary data and model backward trajectories. Two different backward trajectory models have been used to assess the possible mechanisms of transport of water vapour above Bauru, one of which is a large scale model and the other is a meso-scale model. A sharp contrast in the air parcel transport above and below the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) is seen, with large scale convection or descent controlling the water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratios</b> below the TTL, and a combination of large and small scale fields controlling the water vapour in and above the TTL.

40|$|Stratosphere Troposphere {{exchange}} (STE) {{is important}} to study as it controls the chemical composition of the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) and thus the radiative balance of this region. STE also controls the transport of chemicals into the stratosphere which are vital to ozone depletion. The troposphere and the stratosphere have specific chemical characteristics and the transition region between these regions displays characteristics of both. Ozone and water vapour concentrations {{can be used as}} tracers for the characteristics of the troposphere and stratosphere. This thesis develops measures in tracer space, which allow the determination of the strength and depth of atmospheric mixing between the troposphere and the stratosphere in extratropical regions. The application of entropy as a measure of atmospheric mixing as introduced by Patmore and Toumi [2006], is improved in this study. This is a measure of how the ozone and water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratios</b> vary as a result of mixing. An additional metric to give further information on the form of the mixing line in tracer space is also developed. This measure uses the ozone and water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratios</b> at the boundaries of the transition region (BO 3 and BH 2 O). This study uses data from ozonesondes and hygrometers, along with satellite data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). The ozone product from AIRS is also validated as part of this study. The entropy, BO 3 and BH 2 O measures from this study, are successfully shown to detect regions of enhanced mixing in comparison studies. A key comparison shows that the measures developed in this study are able to produce comparable conclusions to higher resolution aircraft data, with regards to mixing. The separation of entropy, BO 3 and BH 2 O, into different categories allows mixing processes to be assigned to some of the categories. Mixing is shown to have geographic preference, with some regions having significantly more mixing. Some categories have preference with regards to their location either poleward or equatorward of the jet stream.

On time scales a few days, δv shows considerable variations, often exceeding 20 per mil, and is higher in the wetting phase than in the drying phase of a weather cycle. In precipitation events, the vapour in the surface layer is in general brought to state of equilibrium with falling raindrops but not with snowflakes. On a diurnal time-scale, a peak-to-peak variation of 1 – 2 per mil is observed at a coastal site. At an interior site, evidence of a diurnal pattern is present only on days of low humidity.

The calculated trajectories were analyzed to determine the distribution of points where individual air masses encounter the minimum temperature and thus minimum water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio</b> during their ascent through the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) into the stratosphere. The geographical distribution of these dehydration points and the local conditions there determine the overall water vapour entry into the stratosphere. Results of two CCMs are presented: the ECHAM 4. L 39 (DLR) /CHEM (hereafter: E 39 /C) from the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the Freie Universität Berlin Climate Middle Atmosphere Model with interactive chemistry (hereafter: FUB-CMAM-CHEM). In the FUB-CMAM-CHEM model the minimum temperatures are overestimated by about 7 K in Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter {{as well as in}} NH summer, resulting in too high water vapour entry values compared to ERA- 40. However, the geographical distribution of dehydration points is fairly reproduced for NH winter 1995 ? 1996 and 1998 ? 1999 and in all boreal summers. The distribution of dehydration points suggests an influence of the Indian monsoon upon the water vapour transport. The E 39 /C model displays a temperature bias of about + 3 K. Hence, the minimum water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratios</b> are higher relative to ERA- 40. The geographical distribution of dehydration points is satisfactory in NH winter 1995 ? 1996 and 1997 ? 1998 with respect to ERA- 40. The distribution is not reproduced for the NH winter 1998 ? 1999 (La Niña event) compared to ERA- 40. There is excessive mass flux through warm regions e. g. Africa, leading to excessive water vapour flux in the NH winter and summer. The possible influence of the Indian monsoon on the transport is not seen in the boreal summer. Further, the residence times of air parcels in the TTL were derived from the trajectory calculations. The analysis of the residence times reveals that in both CCMs residence times in the TTL are underestimated compared to ERA- 40 and the seasonal variation is hardly present...|$|R

To the best of our knowledge, BASIL is the first Raman lidar with a demonstrated capability to simultaneously retrieve daytime profiles of water vapour turbulent fluctuations up to the fourth order throughout the atmospheric CBL. This is combined with the capability of measuring daytime profiles of temperature fluctuations up to the fourth order. These measurements, in combination with measurements from other lidar and in situ systems, are important for verifying and possibly improving turbulence and convection parameterisation in weather and climate models at different scales down to the grey zone (grid increment [*]∼[*]  1  km; Wulfmeyer et al., 2016). For the considered case study, which represents a well-mixed and quasi-stationary CBL, the mean boundary layer height is found to be 1290  ±  75  m above ground level (a. g. l.). Values of the integral scale for water vapour and temperature fluctuations {{at the top of the}} CBL are in the range of 70 – 125 and 75 – 225  s, respectively; these values are much larger than the temporal resolution of the measurements (10  s), which testifies that the temporal resolution considered for the measurements is sufficiently high to resolve turbulent processes down to the inertial subrange and, consequently, to resolve the major part of the turbulent fluctuations. Peak values of all moments are found in the interfacial layer in the proximity of the top of the CBL. Specifically, water vapour and temperature second-order moments (variance) have maximum values of 0. 29  g 2  kg − 2 and 0. 26  K 2; water vapour and temperature third-order moments have peak values of 0. 156  g 3  kg − 3 and − 0. 067  K 3, while water vapour and temperature fourth-order moments have maximum values of 0. 28  g 4  kg − 4 and 0. 24  K 4. Water vapour and temperature kurtosis have values of [*]∼[*]  3 in the upper portion of the CBL, which indicate normally distributed humidity and temperature fluctuations. Reported values of the higher-order moments are in good agreement with previous measurements at different locations, thus providing confidence in the possibility of using these measurements for turbulence parameterisation in weather and climate models. In the determination of the temperature profiles, particular care was dedicated to minimise potential effects associated with elastic signal crosstalk on the rotational Raman signals. For this purpose, a specific algorithm was defined and tested to identify and remove the elastic signal crosstalk and to assess the residual systematic uncertainty affecting temperature measurements after correction. The application of this approach confirms that, for the present Raman lidar system, the crosstalk factor remains constant with time; consequently an appropriate assessment of its constant value allows for a complete removal of the leaking elastic signal from the rotational Raman lidar signals at any time (with a residual error on temperature measurements after correction not exceeding 0. 18  K) ...|$|R

The system provides continuous vertical tropospheric profiles of aerosols, cirrus optical properties and water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio.</b> Located in {{proximity to the}} high altitude Puy de Dôme station, labelled as the GAW global station PUY since August 2014, it is a useful tool to describe the boundary layer dynamics and hence interpret in situ measurements. This LIDAR has been upgraded with specific hardware/software developments and laboratory calibrations {{in order to improve}} the quality of the profiles, calibrate the depolarization ratio, and increase the automation of operation. As a result, we provide a climatological water vapour profile analysis for the 2009 – 2013 period, showing an annual cycle with a winter minimum and a summer maximum, consistent with in-situ observations at the PUY station. An overview of a preliminary climatology of cirrus clouds frequency shows that in 2014, more than 30 % of days present cirrus events. Finally, the backscatter coefficient profile observed on 27 September 2014 shows the capacity of the system to detect cirrus clouds at 13 km altitude, in presence of aerosols below the 5 km altitude...|$|R

40|$|Mesospheric {{water vapour}} has been {{observed}} above ALOMAR in northern Norway (69 ° N 16 ° E) by our group since 1995 using a 22 GHz ground based microwave spectrometer. A new instrument with higher sensitivity, providing a much better time resolution especially in the upper mesosphere, was installed in May 2008. The time resolution is high enough to provide observations of daily variations in the water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio.</b> We present the first ground based detections of tidal behaviour in the polar middle atmospheric water vapour distribution. Diurnal and semidiurnal variations of water vapour have been observed and due to the long chemical lifetime of water they {{are assumed to be}} caused by changing wind patterns which transport water-rich or poor air into the observed region. The detected tidal behaviour does not follow any single other dynamical field but is instead assumed to be a result of the different wind components. Both the diurnal and semidiurnal amplitude and phase components are resolved. The former shows a stable seasonal behaviour consistent with earlier observations of wind fields and model calculations, whereas the latter appears more complex and no regular behaviour has so far been observed...|$|R

40|$|A giant storm erupted on Saturn in December 2010. It {{produced}} intense {{lightning and}} cloud disturbances and encircled {{the planet in}} six months. Six giant storms—also called Great White Spots—have been observed on Saturn since 1876, recurring every 20 to 30 years and alternating between mid-latitudes and the equator. Here we use thermodynamic arguments {{to demonstrate that the}} quasi-periodic occurrence of Saturn’s giant storms can be explained by a water-loading mechanism, in which moist convection is suppressed for decades owing to the relatively large molecular weight of water in a hydrogen–helium atmosphere. We find that the interaction between moist convection and radiative cooling in the troposphere above the cloud base produces an oscillation that leads to giant storm generation with a period of approximately 60 years for either mid-latitudes or the equator, provided the mixing <b>ratio</b> of water <b>vapour</b> in the troposphere exceeds 1. 0 %. We use a two-dimensional axisymmetric dynamic model and a top-cooling convective adjustment scheme to apply our conceptual model to Saturn. For a water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio</b> of 1. 1 %, simulated storms show a recurrence interval, ammonia depletion and tropospheric warming that are consistent with 2010 observations. Jupiter’s atmosphere is more depleted in water than Saturn, which may explain its lack of planet-encircling storms...|$|R
40|$|At the Izaña Observatory, {{water vapour}} amounts have been {{measured}} routinely by different techniques for many years. We intercompare the total {{precipitable water vapour}} (PWV) amounts measured between 2005 and 2009 by a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, a Multifilter Rotating Shadow-band Radiometer (MFRSR), a Cimel sunphotometer, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, and daily radiosondes (Vaisala RS 92). The long-term characteristics of our study allows a reliable and extensive empirical quality assessment of long-term validity, which is an important prerequisite when applying the data to climate research. We estimate a PWV precision of 1 % for the FTIR, about 10 % for the MFRSR, Cimel, and GPS (when excluding rather dry conditions), and significantly better than 15 % for the RS 92 (the detection of different airmasses avoids a better constrained estimation). We show that the MFRSR, Cimel and GPS data quality depends on the atmospheric conditions (humid or dry) and that the restriction to clear-sky observations introduces a significant dry bias in the FTIR and Cimel data. In addition, we intercompare the water vapour profiles measured by the FTIR and the Vaisala RS 92, which allows the conclusion that both experiments are able to detect lower to upper tropospheric water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratios</b> with a precision of better than 15 %...|$|R

Systematic measurements, using both active and passive ground based instruments, will be performed for a period of 12 months, in coincidence with ENVISAT overpasses. A Raman lidar system is used to perform both aerosol and water vapour measurements; aerosol backscatter and extinction coefficients are retrieved from simultaneous elastic signals at 355 nm and inelastic N 2 Raman backscatter lidar signals at 386. 6 nm, whereas, water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio</b> measurements are retrieved from simultaneous H 2 O and N 2 Raman signals. A sun-photometer based on a Mechelle spectrometer is used to measure direct solar irradiance in the wavelength range 300 ÷ 1100 nm and a Fourier infrared spectrometer is used to measure vertical sky radiance in the range 500 ÷ 3000 cm- 1.

40|$|ENEA is {{planning}} to develop a lidar system for measurement of the vertical profi le of water <b>vapour</b> mixing <b>ratio</b> in daytime at a remote site, the Station for Climate Observations located in Lampedusa, Italy. The Raman lidar technique has been retained because of its experimental simplicity with respect to DIAL, and the UV spectral range has been chosen because Raman cross-sections and detector effi ciencies are larger. For a wavelength larger than ~ 300 nm the signal is limited in daytime by sky background, but extinction is acceptable, and {{the aims of the}} system can be reached with a strong laser source. The 355 nm wavelength of a frequency-tripled Nd:YAG laser has been retained as this laser source permits to reach a large pulse energy while keeping the system simple to operate. Geometrical form factor calculations need to be performed to evaluate the near-range overlap between the laser beam and the fi eld-of-view of the receiver. Among several options, a dual-receiver system has been retained to account for the several orders of magnitude expected in the backscattered signal intensity: a smaller receiver, with a primary mirror of 200 mm diameter for the 0. 2 - 1 km range, and a larger 500 mm receiver for the 1 - 3 km range...|$|R
