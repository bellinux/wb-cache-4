40|$|I {{predicted}} the likely effects of {{fire on the}} abundance of grassland birds by determining which <b>vegetal</b> <b>features</b> influenced the distribution and abundance of grassland birds at the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona. Abundance of pyrrhuloxia (Cardinalis sinuatus) (r² = 0. 363), Lucy's warbler (Vermivora luciae) (r² = 0. 348), and total abundance of birds (r² = 0. 358) {{was positively correlated with}} increasing density of mesquite (Prosopis velutina), whereas abundance of cactus wren (Campylorhynchus brunneicappillus) (r² = 0. 452) was negatively correlated with increasing mesquite density. Abundance of loggerhead shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) (r² = 0. 693) was positively correlated with increasing environmental patchiness. Fire is likely to reduce the density of mesquite, thus I predict that those species positively correlated with mesquite density will decline following fire whereas species negatively correlated with mesquite density will benefit...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{embryonic}} {{development of}} Tivela mactroides, from fertilization to straight-hinge veliger D-stage larva occurs in 18 hours at 25 °C. Scanning electronic observations show that morphogenetic processes {{result in a}} gastrula with two depressions 4 hours after fertilization (T 0 + 4 h). Two hours later, one depression, located at the animal pole, develops into an open cave, the floor of which becomes the shell field located below the lower face of the prototrochal pad. The invagination located at the <b>vegetal</b> pole <b>features</b> the blastopore. At T 0 + 6 h, the late gastrula has differentiated into a typical motile trochophore with a shell field synthetizing the organic part of the shell. At T 0 + 8 h, the shell field, located between the prototroch and the telotroch, appears as a saddle-shaped region with a wrinkled surface extending {{on both sides of}} the embryo, establishing bilateral symmetry. At T 0 + 12 h, the prototroch slides toward the anterior region by outgrowth of the shell material. At T 0 + 18 h, the prodissoconch I formation is completed and the D-stage larvae possess a calcified shell. At this stage of development, the functional velum is composed of four bands of cilia. Our observations seem to confirm the interpretation of shell differentiation proposed recently by Mouëza et al. (2006) for bivalves even if Transmission Electronic observations will be necessary to validate definitively such a model in the Meretricinae sub-family...|$|R
50|$|The {{entrance}} to the synagogue is not directly from the street, but through a courtyard. The shape of the synagogue was rectangular, divided into three naves by two large arcades in the Moorish style. The pillars supporting these arches are ocagonal in shape and have large capitals <b>featuring</b> <b>vegetal</b> decoration. Above {{each of the two}} arcades ran a smaller arcade connecting the two big arches from the ground with the top of the central nave. In 1899 a fire completely destroyed the building. Its present appearance is a result of restoration work that took place starting in 1902 and the last one in 2004, when the original plasterwork of the capitals was restored. The reconstruction was possible since small fragments of the original capitals were discovered, which made the reproduction possible. Opposite the entrance hangs a painting by Vicente Cutanda called Miracle in the synagogue (Milagro en la sinagoga), painted in 1902.|$|R
40|$|Piana del Sele" is {{a coastal}} plain {{lying on the}} {{southern}} reach of the Tyrrhenian coast and is of great historical and archeological concern in that here are located the Greek town of Poseidon and the sanctuary devote to Hera Argiva nearby the Sele outlet. A geomorphologic survey and a multidisciplinary study on sediment cores from 16 boreholes drilled along 3 transect close {{to the mouth of}} the River Sele provided the following characterization of sedimentary suite: a - Lowermost unit: it consists of clay and silty clay sediments enriched in peat and/or disperded organic matter up to 20 m thick and ranging in radiocarbon age from 10 to 6 kyr B. P. Ostracods point out an environment trending from brackish to freshwater conditions whereas and benthic foraminifers compatible with low salinity prevail. Pollen analysis revealed abundance hygrophilous and hydrophilus plants along with the recurrent occurrence of alder woods. Thus it results that the unit was deposited in a low salinity/fresh water coastal basin (lagoon/marsh). b- Intermediate unit: it includes up to 10 m of sands and pebbles; based on the overall features the unit is referred to a former beach/dune system. This sediment suite records a marine ingression, 14 C dated from 10 through 5 kyr B. P. as well as the subsequent sea retreat. c - Uppermost unit: it is made up of weathered clay or fine, dark red colored sediments, containing both carbonate concretions and <b>vegetal</b> debris. Such <b>features</b> do reflect the subaerial deposition developed {{at the back of the}} beach/dune system that, since 5 kyr B. P., commenced to migrate seawards up to the present position in response to a progressive marine regression. Radiocarbon datings point out that the Holocene transgression lasted up to 5 kyr B. P. and according to field evidence the relative sea-level rised ca. 1 m above the present one; since then up to now apart from small fluctuations the relative sea-level decreased. It is just during this phase of sea withdraw, in a palaeoenvironmental scenario where the former lagoons and marshes were drying up and a regime of subaerial deposition was in progress, that the sanctuary of Hera Argiva was erected...|$|R
