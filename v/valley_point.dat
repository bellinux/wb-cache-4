Due to low advertising and budget cuts, the news operation was shut down in 1974; however, the station continued to provide weather updates during the evening hours. News programming returned to the station in 1978, with a single daily broadcast each evening under the News 38 branding; at one point, the station's news staff was largely composed of former employees from WTHI-TV's news department. WBAK discontinued local news programming with the cancellation of its evening newscast in 1981; for the last fourteen years of its tenure as an ABC affiliate, the station only broadcast syndicated programs at both 6:00 and 11:00 p.m. However, the station would produce a weekday morning program titled Good Morning Terre Haute, which consisted of interviews and included a weather segment. The station also aired its own public affairs programming; one such program, <b>Valley</b> <b>Point</b> of View, ran until 2004 and was produced by the organization Leadership Terre Haute.|$|E

40|$|Real {{magnetic}} and {{lattice deformation}} gauge fields {{have been investigated}} in honeycomb lattice of graphene. The coexistence of these two gauges will induce a gap difference between two <b>valley</b> <b>points</b> (K and K') of system. This gap difference allows us to study the possible topological valley Hall current and valley polarization in the graphene sheet. In the absence of magnetic field, the strain alone could not generate a valley polarization when the Fermi energy coincides exactly with the Dirac points. Since in this case there is not any imbalance between {{the population of the}} <b>valley</b> <b>points.</b> In other words each of these gauges alone could not induce any topological valley-polarized current in the system at zero Fermi energy. Meanwhile at non-zero Fermi energies population imbalance can be generated {{as a result of the}} external strain even at zero magnetic field. In the context of Berry curvature within the linear response regime the valley polarization (both magnetic free polarization, Π_ 0, and field dependent response function, χ_α) in different values of gauge fields of lattice deformation has been obtained...|$|R

Hand-geometry {{biometric}} {{recognition is}} normally {{based on the}} detection of five points that correspond to the fingertips and four <b>points</b> between them (<b>valley</b> <b>points).</b> Specific methods often have to be implemented during the acquisition stage to make the detection of those points easier. This study presents techniques {{that have been developed}} to overcome the difficulties and limitations of the current systems.

A methodology was developed based on the hand skeleton for the points on the fingertips and for the <b>valley</b> <b>points</b> it was based on the cur-vature of the hand contour. The principal difficulties were found during the segmentation step, which often fails if the fingers are not spread out. Once the points have been located, the necessary features for authentica-tion were extracted. Classification algorithms were implemented at this stage.

40|$|We {{consider}} a two-dimensional bipartite lattice system. In such a system, the Bloch band spectrum {{can have some}} valley points, around which Dirac fermions appear as the low-energy excitations. Each <b>valley</b> <b>point</b> has a valley spin + 1 or - 1. In such a system, there are two topological numbers counting vortices and merons in the Brillouin zone, respectively. These numbers are equivalent, and this fact leads to a sum rule which states that the total sum of the valley spins is absent even in a system without time-reversal and parity symmetries. We can see some similarity between the valley spin and chirality in the Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem in odd-spatial dimensions.

The trend of this canyon seems to connect the conductive surface sediments of the Longitudinal Valley with the highly conductive West Fissure Zone (see Figure 7 a,b (K)). The surrounding igneous rocks display high resistivity. This large conductivity contrast forces currents to flow along the gorge, resulting in anomalous phases. The same behavior is observed at site 685 (see Additional file 4) located in a canyon between Longitudinal Valley and Precordillera.Near to the surface in the Longitudinal Valley, highly conductive sediments are modeled (see Figure 7 (K)), while more resistive material is dominant at greater depth. Remarkably, induction arrows in the Longitudinal <b>Valley</b> <b>point</b> to the west, away from the conductive West Fissure zone.|$|E

40|$|The Parasicilide {{succession}} is a {{key element}} of the southern Apennine orogen, being originally located in the distal portion of the Apulian palaeomargin, at the Neotethys ocean-continent transition.

However, detailed investigations carried out in the Sele <b>Valley</b> <b>point</b> out that there the Parasicilide Unit is characterized by a coherent stratigraphy. Therefore, in the study area, these rocks form a coherent sheet of distal continental margin/oceanic sedimentary cover material included within the peri-Tyrrhenian mountain belt.

40|$|The {{interplay of}} Ising spin-orbit {{coupling}} and non-trivial band topology in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) produces anomalous transport and optical properties {{that are very}} different from a regular 2 D electron gas. The spin-momentum locking of optically excited carriers near a <b>valley</b> <b>point</b> can give rise to an anomalous spin-valley Hall current under the application of an in-plane electric field. TMDs also exhibit strong electron-nuclear hyperfine interactions, but their effect on spin-valley-locked currents remains unknown. Here, we show that hyperfine interactions can create a feedback mechanism in which spin-valley currents generate significant dynamical nuclear polarization which in turn Zeeman shifts excitonic transitions out of resonance with an optical driving field, saturating the production of spin-valley polarization. We propose an experimental signature of dynamic nuclear polarization which can be detected via measurements of the anomalous Hall current. Our results help to elucidate the interplay of valley polarization and nuclear spin dynamics in TMDs. Comment: 12 pages, 8 figures. Replaced with the version accepted in Physical Review...|$|E
