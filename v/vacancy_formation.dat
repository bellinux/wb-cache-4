A systematic study [...] across a wide growth parameter space demonstrated different roles played by oxygen <b>vacancy</b> <b>formation</b> and the polar gating at different interfaces. An obvious difference between oxygen vacancies and polar gating in creating the interface conductivity is that the carriers from oxygen vacancies are thermally activated as the donor level of oxygen vacancies is usually separated from the SrTiO3 conduction band, consequently exhibiting the carrier freeze-out effect at low temperatures; in contrast, the carriers originating from the polar gating are transferred into the SrTiO3 conduction band (Ti 3d orbitals) and are therefore degenerate.|$|E

Background. This work {{is related}} to the {{theoretical}} calculation of the <b>vacancy</b> <b>formation</b> energy in the context of finding an answer to two unsolved questions.

Secondly, the existing phenomenological theories tacitly assume that the <b>vacancy</b> <b>formation</b> energy and entropy of <b>vacancy</b> <b>formation</b> do not depend on temperature. Objective. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of temperature factor on the free energy of <b>vacancy</b> <b>formation</b> and its components in a number of metals within the quasi-harmonic approximation. Methods. The <b>vacancy</b> <b>formation</b> energy and entropy in FCC Al, Ag, and Pd are determined as a function of temperature using ab initio methods within a quasi-harmonic approximation. Results. It was shown, that the <b>vacancy</b> <b>formation</b> energy substantially increases with temperature in all cases, which {{is related to}} the thermal lattice expansion. Such increase of the <b>vacancy</b> <b>formation</b> energy is compensated by the vibrational <b>vacancy</b> <b>formation</b> entropy contribution. The latter appears to be strongly increasing with temperature in the case of Mo. Conclusions. However, a thermodynamic analysis shows that such increase of <b>vacancy</b> <b>formation</b> energy in the process of calculation is largely underestimated. The latter is compensated by contribution from vibrating entropy of <b>vacancy</b> <b>formation</b> and strongly increases with temperature.

Both previous literature in various systems and our calculations in LaMnO 3, La 0. 75 Sr 0. 25 MnO 3, LaFeO 3, and La 0. 75 Sr 0. 25 FeO 3, show mixed results for the direction and magnitude {{of the change in}} <b>vacancy</b> <b>formation</b> energy with strain.

We model strain effects using a set of consistent ab initio calculations, and demonstrate that our calculated results may be simply explained in terms of <b>vacancy</b> <b>formation</b> volume and changes in elastic constants between the bulk and defected states. A positive <b>vacancy</b> <b>formation</b> volume contributes to decreased <b>vacancy</b> <b>formation</b> energy under tensile strain, and an increase in elastic constants contributes to increases in <b>vacancy</b> <b>formation</b> energy with compressive and tensile strains, and vice versa.
