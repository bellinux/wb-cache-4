40|$|The {{need for}} an {{improved}} vaccine against tuberculosis {{has never been more}} urgent.

Since 2002, there have been increasing numbers of TB vaccine candidates entering into clinical trials. The first of these candidates, MVA 85 A, is safe and highly immunogenic in all trials to date.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), an {{attenuated}} strain of tuberculous bacillus, {{is the source}} of vaccines providing unclear and <b>variable</b> <b>protection</b> against tuberculosis (TB) and cancer. Thermostable macromolecular antigens (TMAs) are major mycobacterial complexes immunodominant in disease. A 60 (TMA complex of BCG) protects mice against TB development, via T lymphocyte (TL) -mediated macrophage (Mphi) activation, halting intracellular mycobacterial replication. In most A 60 -primed mice, cytolytic TLs and Mphi infiltrate cancer tissue, resulting in 80 - 100 % rejection. Adoptive TL transfer is indispensable for Mphi-dependent tumour cell inactivation via oxygen and nitrogen radicals. Neoplasm development induces immune anergy with depletion ofA 60 -specific TL and activated Mphi. A 60 protects mice against TB and cancer by inducing the synthesis of three lymphokines: interleukin 2 (IL- 2), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Tumour cells prevent A 60 -dependent synthesis of these lymphokines in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSION: These data provide some clues to immune surveillance and tumour escape mechanisms, {{as well as to the}} antituberculous and antineoplastic BCG action...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBCG, {{the only}} {{licensed}} vaccine against tuberculosis (TB), provides geographically <b>variable</b> <b>protection,</b> an effect ascribed to exposure to environmental mycobacteria (EM). Here {{we show that}} altering the intestinal microbiota of mice by early-life infection with the commensal bacterium Helicobacter hepaticus (Hh) increases their susceptibility to challenge with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Furthermore Hh-infected mice immunised parenterally with the recombinant subunit vaccine, human adenovirus type 5 expressing the immunodominant antigen 85 A of Mtb (Ad 85 A), display a reduced lung immune response and protection against Mtb challenge is also reduced. Expression of interleukin 10 (IL 10) messenger RNA is increased in the colon of Hh infected mice. Treatment of Hh-infected Ad 85 A-immunised mice with anti-IL 10 receptor antibody, following challenge with Mtb, restores the protective effect of the vaccine. These data show {{for the first time}} that alteration of the intestinal microbiota by addition of a single commensal organism can profoundly influence protection induced by a TB subunit vaccine via an IL 10 -dependent mechanism, a result with implications for the deployment of such vaccines in the field...|$|E
40|$|Background Previous {{research}} has identified {{the role of}} social capital in explaining variations in health in {{the countries of the}} former Soviet Union. This study explores whether the benefits of social capital vary among these countries and why. Methods The impact of micro social capital (trust, membership and social isolation) on individual health was estimated in each of eight former Soviet republics using instrumental variables to overcome methodological hazards such as endogeneity and reverse causality. Interactions with institutional variables (voice and accountability, effectiveness of the legal system, informal economy) and social <b>protection</b> <b>variables</b> (employment <b>protection,</b> old age and disability benefits, sickness and health benefits) were examined. Results Most social capital indicators, in most countries, are associated with better health but the magnitude and significance of the impact differ between countries. Some of this variation can be explained by interacting social capital indicators with measures of institutional quality, with membership of organisations bringing greater benefit for health in countries where civil liberties are stronger, whereas social isolation has more adverse consequences where there is a large informal economy. A lesser amount is explained by the interaction of social capital indicators with selected measures of social protection. Conclusion When considering interventions to improve social capital as a means of improving population health, it seems advisable {{to take into account the}} influence of macrocontextual variables, in order not to overstate or understate the likely impact of the intervention...|$|R

40|$|Non-ribosomally formed {{peptides}} display both highly conserved {{and variable}} amino acid positions, the variations {{leading to a}} wide range of peptide families. Activation of the amino acid substrate proceeds in analogy to the ribosomal biosynthetic mechanism generating aminoacyl adenylate and acyl intermediates. To approach the mechanism of fidelity of amino acid selection, the stability of the aminoacyl adenylates was studied by employing a continuous coupled spectrophotometric assay. The apo-form of tyrocidine synthetase 1 (apo-TY 1) was used, generating an l-phenylalanyl-adenylate intermediate stabilized by the interaction of two structural subdomains of the adenylation domain. Adenylates of substrate analogues have shown variable and reduced degrees of stability, thus leading to an enhanced generation of pyrophosphate due to hydrolysis and continuous adenylate formation. Discrimination of the non-aromatic amino acids l-Leu and l-Met, or l-Phe analogues such as p-amino- and p-chloro-l-Phe derivatives, as well as the stereospecific selection of l-Phe, is supported by less-stable adenylate intermediates exhibiting elevated susceptibility to hydrolysis. Breakdown of the l-phenylalanyl intermediate utilizing 2 '-deoxy-ATP as the nucleotide substrate was significantly enhanced compared with the natural analogue. Apo-TY 1 engineered at positions involved in adenylate formation showed <b>variable</b> <b>protection</b> against hydrolysis.

To cope with this complexity in demodulation, we derive simplified pertier detection schemes with performance close to maximumlikelihood and ability to collect the diversity provided as symbols propagate through diversified channels across successive broadcastings.
