5|$|During {{his five}} {{years with the}} Indians he was {{primarily}} used as a starting pitcher, although he did display the <b>versatility</b> that would become his hallmark. He pitched in 139 games for the Indians, starting 100 and finishing 27. Early evidence of his <b>versatility</b> is demonstrated by his 41 complete games, 9 shutouts and 8 saves.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the athletes}} competed in several sports because each country {{selected}} their team based on <b>versatility</b> of sporting ability to reduce their team size and costs.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} Sanjay Dutt {{was because of}} his <b>versatility,</b> said Chopra in an interview. He {{also said that the}} affable nature of Sanjay was a plus during film making.|$|E
5|$|These {{tables were}} {{developed}} by Tom Hennessy to replace the RNPL/BSAC tables when the Club wanted a set of tables which could approach the <b>versatility</b> of a dive computer.|$|E
5|$|Between June 1990 and 1998, Highway401 and Interstate75 {{were used}} for a pilot project named Advantage I-75 to test the {{reliability}} and <b>versatility</b> of an automated tracking system for transport trucks. Termed MACS for Mainline Automated Clearance System, it would allow a truck to travel from Florida to Ontario without a second inspection.|$|E
5|$|Cooksey was {{a utility}} player, {{due to his}} <b>versatility</b> on the left-flank and in the centre of midfield as a box-to-box midfielder. He was predominately a Midfielder, {{throughout}} his career playing in the centre or on the left-wing. During his spell with Grays Athletic, he {{was used as a}} defender, playing as a left full-back.|$|E
5|$|KMFDM's {{music has}} since been a fusion of {{electronic}} and heavy metal, with occasional elements of dub, as well as orchestral samples and live horns. Many songs feature prominent backing vocals by female singers such as Dorona Alberti, Travis, and Cifarelli. Many of the musicians who have played in the band are multi-instrumentalists, {{so there is a}} degree of <b>versatility</b> and freedom in the music.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{developed}} for welding aluminium and other non-ferrous {{materials in the}} 1940s, GMAW was soon applied to steels because it provided faster welding time compared to other welding processes. The cost of inert gas limited its use in steels until several years later, when the use of semi-inert gases such as carbon dioxide became common. Further developments during the 1950s and 1960s gave the process more <b>versatility</b> and as a result, it became a highly used industrial process. Today, GMAW {{is the most common}} industrial welding process, preferred for its <b>versatility,</b> speed and the relative ease of adapting the process to robotic automation. Unlike welding processes that do not employ a shielding gas, such as shielded metal arc welding, it is rarely used outdoors or in other areas of air volatility. A related process, flux cored arc welding, often does not use a shielding gas, but instead employs an electrode wire that is hollow and filled with flux.|$|E
5|$|Parts to be {{injection}} moulded {{must be very}} carefully designed to facilitate the moulding process; the material used for the part, the desired shape and features of the part, the material of the mould, and {{the properties of the}} moulding machine must all be taken into account. The <b>versatility</b> of injection moulding is facilitated by this breadth of design considerations and possibilities.|$|E
5|$|Spencer Bonaventure Tracy (April 5, 1900– June 10, 1967) was an American actor, {{noted for}} his natural style and <b>versatility.</b> One {{of the major}} stars of Hollywood's Golden Age, Tracy won two Academy Awards for Best Actor, from nine {{nominations}}, sharing the record for nominations in that category with Laurence Olivier.|$|E
5|$|The brigade was {{the first}} of the US Army's Engineer Brigades to be {{converted}} to a modular design. This means that the Brigade can be deployed and sustain itself independently, without a division or corps level command supporting it. Additionally, the brigade's design allows it to take command of additional units within a theatre of operations, allowing for greater <b>versatility</b> on the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} may also show <b>versatility</b> in its diet. On islands with seabird colonies, it will prey on {{the eggs and}} chicks of terns and other seabirds. During {{migration}} {{it has also been}} reported to eat exhausted migrating landbirds. Birds of the Seychelles race also indulge in some kleptoparasitism, chasing the chicks of sooty terns and forcing them to disgorge food.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon {{is a well}} respected falconry bird due to its strong hunting ability, high trainability, <b>versatility,</b> {{and in recent years}} availability via captive breeding. It is effective on most game bird species from small to large.|$|E
5|$|A {{person can}} obtain more {{or all of}} the {{categories}} at once. But the set of categories needs to be known before the exam and highest score needs to be met. Typically, people obtain E and B category because these two categories provides the best <b>versatility</b> (almost any firearm can be owned and carried concealed). The D category is required by the law for the members of the municipal police (members of the state police do not need license for on duty firearms) and does not itself permit private gun ownership (unless the person obtains also other license category).|$|E
5|$|After winning {{back to back}} Presidents' Trophies {{in prior}} seasons the Canucks were {{projected}} as Stanley Cup contenders. The prediction was based on Vancouver's team depth, the offense provided by Daniel and Henrik Sedin, the two-way play of Kesler and Alexandre Burrows, plus the <b>versatility</b> of the Canuck's top four defenceman. The Hockey News predicted that the Canucks would win the Northwest Division and finish as the second place team in the Western Conference.|$|E
5|$|An {{extremely}} selective list {{of those}} with whom Manne performed includes Benny Carter, Earl Hines, Clifford Brown, Zoot Sims, Ben Webster, Maynard Ferguson, Wardell Gray, Lionel Hampton, Junior Mance, Jimmy Giuffre, and Stan Getz. In the 1950s, he recorded two solid albums with Sonny RollinsWay Out West (Contemporary, 1957) received particular acclaim and helped dispel the notion that West Coast jazz was always different from jazz made on the East Coastand, in the 1960s, two with Bill Evans. Around {{the same time in}} 1959, Manne recorded with the traditional Benny Goodman and the iconoclastic Ornette Coleman, a striking example of his <b>versatility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because of the <b>versatility</b> of {{the process}} and the {{simplicity}} of its equipment and operation, shielded metal arc welding is one of the world's first and most popular welding processes. It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though flux-cored arc welding is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E
5|$|Falafel {{has become}} popular among vegetarians and vegans, as an {{alternative}} to meat-based street foods, and is now sold in packaged mixes in health-food stores. While traditionally thought of as being used to make veggie burgers, its use has expanded as more and more people have adopted it as a source of protein. In the United States, falafel's <b>versatility</b> has allowed for the reformulating of recipes for meatloaf, sloppy joes and spaghetti and meatballs into vegetarian dishes.|$|E
5|$|Floating {{storage and}} {{offloading}} units (FSO) are used worldwide by the offshore oil industry to receive oil from nearby platforms and store {{it until it}} can be offloaded onto oil tankers. A similar system, the floating production storage and offloading unit (FPSO), {{has the ability to}} process the product while it is on board. These floating units reduce oil production costs and offer mobility, large storage capacity, and production <b>versatility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Having honed his {{personal}} style {{as a young}} man, and sticking broadly with {{it for the rest}} of his career, Massenet does not, as some other composers do, lend himself to classification into clearly defined early, middle and late periods. Moreover, his <b>versatility</b> means that there is no plot or locale that can be regarded as typical Massenet. Another respect in which he differed from many opera composers is that he did not work regularly with the same librettists: Grove lists more than thirty writers who provided him with librettos.|$|E
5|$|He {{signed a}} five-year contract, which was worth nearly eight million dollars with a {{five and a}} half million dollar signing bonus, within two months of the draft. Dick Jauron, who was then the Bears' head coach, {{recognized}} Urlacher's <b>versatility</b> as a middle and outside linebacker, and appointed him as the team's starting strongside linebacker. However, Urlacher struggled to perform consistently in his first professional game, and lost his starting position to Rosevelt Colvin. Jauron left Urlacher on the sidelines during the following week, as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers shut out the Bears, 41–0.|$|E
5|$|Kan'ami Kiyotsugu {{and his son}} Zeami Motokiyo brought Noh to what is {{essentially}} its present-day form during the Muromachi period (1336 to 1573). Kan'ami was a renowned actor with great <b>versatility</b> fulfilling roles from graceful women and 12-year-old boys to strong adult males. When Kan'ami first presented his work to 17-year-old Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Zeami was a child actor in his play, around age 12. Yoshimitsu {{fell in love with}} Zeami and his position of favor at court caused Noh to be performed frequently for Yoshimitsu thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Lemaire {{has since}} re-entered retirement, and was {{replaced}} by former Florida head coach Peter DeBoer on July 19, 2011. The team showed greater offensive prowess during the 2011–12 season, employing a more aggressive forecheck centered on Ilya Kovalchuk. Under DeBoer's system, according to Lamoriello, the Devils' defenseman were often sent into the offensive zone to apply pressure on the opposing team's defense. After DeBoer's dismissal, Adam Oates had a similar approach improving the Devils' offense, investing on the <b>versatility</b> of the forwards.|$|E
5|$|Produced by Rubalcaba, {{the album}} was {{released}} following his collaborative work with Charlie Haden on the album Nocturne, {{which resulted in a}} Grammy Award for Haden. Supernova includes nine tracks and met with mostly positive reviews by critics, most commenting on the <b>versatility</b> and musical ability of the performer. The album was further nominated for a Grammy, a Billboard Latin Music Award, and earned the Latin Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Album.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers also {{praised the}} {{gameplay}} and system mechanics. Maxwell McGee of GameSpot credited {{the ability to}} adjust team sizes, adding that the trade-off between strength and <b>versatility</b> helped to accommodate a wider skill range of players. Neidel Crisan of 1UP praised the tutorial system for teaching beginner players about the fundamentals of the fighting game genre. Daniel Maniago of G4 complimented the custom assists, anti-infinite system, and online play, praising Reverge Labs for utilizing feedback from the fighting game community during development.|$|E
5|$|The Morgan is a compact, refined breed, {{generally}} bay, {{black or}} chestnut in color, although {{they come in}} many colors, including several variations of pinto. Used in both English and Western disciplines, the breed {{is known for its}} <b>versatility.</b> The Morgan is the state animal of Vermont and the state horse of Massachusetts. Popular children's authors, including Marguerite Henry and Ellen Feld, have portrayed the breed in their books; Henry's Justin Morgan Had a Horse was later made into a Disney movie.|$|E
5|$|The Nefertiti bust {{has become}} a {{cultural}} symbol of Berlin as well as ancient Egypt. Nefertiti herself has become quite an icon. Nefertiti is widely known for her beauty and <b>versatility.</b> It has also {{been the subject of}} an intense argument between Egypt and Germany over Egyptian demands for its repatriation. It was dragged into controversy by the Body of Nefertiti art exhibition and also by doubts over its authenticity. However various testing and analysis of the bust have proved it to be authentic.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the world, {{different}} seasoning {{and spices}} {{are used to}} augment the flavor of fried chicken. Because of the <b>versatility</b> of fried chicken, {{it is not uncommon}} to flavor the chicken's crisp exterior with a variety of spices ranging from spicy to savory. Depending on regional market ubiquity, local spice variations may be labeled as distinct from traditional Southern U.S. flavors, or may appear on menus without notation. With access to chickens suitable for frying broadening on a global scale with the advent of industrialized poultry farming, many localities have added their own mark on fried chicken, tweaking recipes to suit local preferences.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural and {{forestry}} work were the traditional {{uses of the}} Finnhorse. The Finnhorse was never bred to be a particularly large or heavy draught horse, {{as it was the}} only horse breed of the country, and <b>versatility</b> was desired as the Finnhorse was also used as the primary steed of the cavalry. The climate and conditions of Finland necessitated that the breed be durable and hardy. As a result, the Finnhorse remained small but tough, and could pull heavy loads in difficult terrain and even in chest-deep snow. Relative to its size, the Finnhorse is among the most powerful workhorses in the world with the best animals able to pull as much as 200percent of their own weight.|$|E
5|$|As Cannon—along {{with most}} of the {{defensive}} starters—returned, LSU was expected to compete for another title in 1959. The Tigers began the season as the top-ranked team, and the number of season-ticket holders tripled compared to the previous season. The team won its first six games without allowing a touchdown. Cannon showed his <b>versatility</b> in those games; he led the team in total yards on offense, returned an interception for a touchdown on defense, and averaged 40 yards per punt while also returning punts and kickoffs. This set up a highly anticipated match-up between LSU and rival Ole Miss Rebels, who were also undefeated.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the RAAF's prime {{transport}} aircraft was the twin-engined Douglas C-47 Dakota. In 1946, C-47 operations were concentrated under No.86 Wing and its three flying squadrons, Nos.36, 37, and 38, based initially at RAAF Station Schofields, New South Wales. Despite the robustness and <b>versatility</b> of the Dakota, by the early 1950s the Air Force {{was looking for a}} replacement with greater cargo capacity and longer range, to better facilitate the deployment and supply of Australian forces. In 1954, the RAAF embarked on a major re-equipment drive, following a shift in defence funding that favoured the Air Force. The Air Officer Commanding Home Command, Air Vice Marshal Alister Murdoch, led a mission overseas to examine potential new fighter, bomber, transport and training aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{criticism}} that has followed Watts, he has maintained {{a spot in the}} senior side throughout his career and has played over one hundred matches. Furthermore, he has featured in the top ten of Melbourne's best and fairest count three times, including finishing fifth in the 2016 count. Drafted as a forward and playing the majority of his career in the forward line, he has kicked over one hundred goals, including a career-high season in 2016, in which he kicked thirty-eight goals. Although he has played a majority of his career in the forward line, he has been praised for his <b>versatility</b> which allows him to play in multiple positions on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Dox wrote prolifically {{over the}} course of his career, {{yielding}} nine poem anthologies, numerous books in prose, and sixteen plays along Biblical themes or Malagasy history and folk tales. In addition, he wrote a number of plays on commission for various clients, with many commissioned by Boy Scout troupes, although these have since been lost. His translation from French to Malagasy of three major Western novels was significant because they enriched Malagasy literature by introducing elements of the novel form that had never before been attempted in Malagasy language. These efforts demonstrated to other Malagasy language writers the <b>versatility</b> of the language and the possibility that it could be used for any literary form.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{phenomena}} {{have been}} studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary <b>versatility</b> means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, GMAW was {{developed}} by the Battelle Memorial Institute. It used a smaller diameter electrode and a constant voltage power source developed by H. E. Kennedy. It offered a high deposition rate, but the high cost of inert gases limited its use to non-ferrous materials and prevented cost savings. In 1953, the use of carbon dioxide as a welding atmosphere {{was developed}}, and it quickly gained popularity in GMAW, since it made welding steel more economical. In 1958 and 1959, the short-arc variation of GMAW was released, which increased welding <b>versatility</b> and made the welding of thin materials possible while relying on smaller electrode wires and more advanced power supplies. It quickly became the most popular GMAW variation.|$|E
5|$|McElhenny first rose {{to stardom}} as a {{standout}} all-around player for Compton Junior College in 1948. He {{then transferred to}} the University of Washington, {{where he was a}} two-time All-Pacific Coast Conference fullback for the Washington Huskies football team and set several school and conference records. He was drafted by the 49ers with the ninth pick in the 1951 NFL Draft, and his <b>versatility</b> made him an immediate star in the league, earning him five first-team All-Pro honors in his first six seasons. With the 49ers, he was selected for five Pro Bowls, and he earned a sixth Pro Bowl appearance with the Vikings. He finished his career after short stints with the Giants and Lions.|$|E
