40|$|Abstract: Real options present {{advantages}} over the standard discounting methods. In this paper we analyze them briefly and examine their potential applications on information security. The applications of real options on <b>valuation</b> of <b>information</b> assets, information security investment and capital budgeting provide considerable benefits. Finally portfolios of real options {{and other financial}} products can reduce information security risk. Key words: Real options, <b>information</b> security, <b>valuation,</b> <b>information</b> security investment, capital budgeting, portfolio theory, information security risk. Introduction to real options "A real option is the right, but not the obligation, to take an action at a predetermined cost called the exercise price, for a predetermined period of time-the life of the option " (COPELAND & ANTIKAROV, 2001, p. 5). The development of real options theory came {{as a response to}} th...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} belief revision algorithm, based on intuitive policies for <b>information</b> <b>valuation.</b> Policies for <b>valuation</b> of <b>information,</b> based on {{characteristics of the}} information and the sources providing it, are delineated as guidelines for algorithm construction. In addition, each policy is traceably incorporated into the belief revision process to provide justification for calculated belief certainties. Finally, since modeling of information source trustworthiness can be complicated, significant effort is devoted to constructing these reputation models. Experimental results show that application of <b>information</b> <b>valuation</b> policies to belief revision yields significant improvement in belief accuracy and precision over no-policy or single-policy belief revision. 1...|$|R

Findings show that aggregating joint venture and associate investment numbers, and aggregating joint venture revenues and expenses, each leads to loss of forecasting and <b>valuation</b> relevant <b>information.</b> Thus, current US {{accounting principles}} likely mask information that financial statement users {{could use to}} predict future earnings and explain share prices.
