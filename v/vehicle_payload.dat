The legally permissible maximum <b>vehicle</b> <b>payload</b> was between 7 800 and 11 750 kg: with a trailer this increased to 20 000 kg.

50|$|A {{multiple}} reentry <b>vehicle</b> <b>payload</b> for a {{ballistic missile}} deploys multiple warheads {{in a pattern}} against a single target (as opposed to multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle, which deploys multiple warheads against multiple targets). The advantage of an MRV over a single warhead is that the damage produced {{in the center of}} the pattern is far greater than the damage possible from any single warhead in the MRV cluster; this makes for an efficient area attack weapon. The number of warheads makes interception by anti-ballistic missiles unlikely.|$|E

To get there, the mission concept is to launch multiple launch vehicles months, even years apart. In {{order to achieve}} this, launch <b>vehicles,</b> <b>payloads</b> (satellites and crew capsules), and ground systems must be highly reliable and/or available, to include maintenance concepts and procedures {{in the event of}} a launch scrub. In order to achieve this high probability of mission success, Ground Systems Development and Operations (GSDO) has allocated Reliability, Maintainability, and Availability (RMA) requirements to all hardware and software required for both launch operations and, {{in the event of a}} launch scrub, required to support a repair of the ground systems, launch <b>vehicle,</b> or <b>payload.</b> This is done concurrently with the design process (30 / 60 / 90 reviews) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{spacecraft}} bus {{carries the}} payload. Its subsystems support the payload and helps in pointing the payload correctly. It puts the payload {{in the right}} orbit and keeps it there. It provides housekeeping functions. It also provides orbit and attitude maintenance, electric power, command, telemetry and data handling, structure and rigidity, temperature control, data storage and communication, if required.

50|$|When {{details of}} the Voskhod design were later revealed, {{it was simply a}} {{modification}} of the one-man Vostok rather than a new design, with a three-man rectangular cabin replacing the cylinder, and larger retrorockets. The Voskhod 1 crew could not wear space suits, because the spacecraft taxed the limits of the launch <b>vehicle</b> <b>payload</b> capability. The complete Voskhod spacecraft weighed 5682 kg. On Voskhod 2, one cosmonaut seat was replaced with a cumbersome, inflatable airlock (which gave Leonov much trouble reentering the capsule) necessitated by the inability of the capsule avionics to avoid overheating in the vacuum of space. The design proved so troublesome, that the Soviets discontinued the program after the two flights.|$|E
