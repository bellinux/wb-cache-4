40|$|This paper {{examines}} advertising {{images of}} fashion brands in <b>vertical</b> <b>social</b> <b>network</b> site (SNS) from the viewpoints of message strategies. <b>Vertical</b> <b>social</b> <b>network</b> sites are types of social curation systems applied to social networking, where information is selected, organized, and maintained. Fashion brands communicate with consumers by presenting images on vertical SNSs, anticipating improvements in brand image, popularity, and loyalty. Those images portray content for particular brands and seasonal concepts, thus creating paths for product sales information. Marketing via SNSs corresponds to relationship marketing, {{which refers to}} long-term interrelationship and value augmentation between the company and consumer, and viral advertising, which relies on word of mouth distribution via social network platforms. Taylor’s six-segment message strategy wheel, often used for analyzing viral ads, was applied to conduct a content analysis of the images. A total of 2, 656 images of fashion brands advertised on Instagram were selected and analyzed. Results indicated that brand values were somewhat related {{to the number of}} followers. Follower rankings and comment rankings were also correlated. In general, fashion brands projected sensory messages most often. Acute need and rational messages were less common than other messages. Sports brands and luxury brands presented sensory messages, whereas fast fashion brands projected routine images most often. Fashion brands promoted on vertical SNSs should portray advertising images that combine message strategies. ? ??? 2014 ? ????? ????? ???? ?????(201400000002535) ...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, social {{networking}} platforms have developed into extraordinary channels for spreading and consuming in-formation. Along {{with the rise}} of such infrastructure, there is continuous progress on techniques for spreading informa-tion effectively through influential users. In many applica-tions, one is restricted to select influencers from a set of users who engaged with the topic being promoted, and due to the structure of <b>social</b> <b>networks,</b> these users often rank low in terms of their influence potential. An alternative ap-proach one can consider is an adaptive method which selects users in a manner which targets their influential neighbors. The advantage of such an approach is that it leverages the friendship paradox in social networks: while users are often not influential, they often know someone who is. Despite the various complexities in such optimization prob-lems, we show that scalable adaptive seeding is achievable. In particular, we develop algorithms for linear influence mod-els with provable approximation guarantees that can be grace-fully parallelized. To show the effectiveness of our methods we collected data from various <b>verticals</b> <b>social</b> <b>network</b> users follow. For each vertical, we collected data on the users who responded to a certain post as well as their neighbors, and applied our methods on this data. Our experiments show that adaptive seeding is scalable, and importantly, that it obtains dramatic improvements over standard approaches of information dissemination. 1...|$|R

We find that stores in the <b>social</b> <b>network</b> are {{significantly less likely to}} vertically integrate than non-member stores. This has three primary implications. First, the <b>social</b> <b>network</b> may be lowering the costs of using the market more than facilitating in-house production. This implies better outsourcing opportunities in a <b>social</b> <b>network</b> and may therefore help explain a documented relationship between <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> and the economic performance of firms.

This paper uses empirical data from households and community surveys and case studies, to examine the role, strengths, and limits of social capital in managing conflicts over the use and management of natural resources. We inventoried over 700 cases ranging from conflicts between multiple resource users to supra-community conflicts between local communities concerns for better livelihoods and national/international concerns for environment conservation. Results show how different types of social capital are used in preventing and managing conflicts. Endowment in certain dimensions of social capital significantly decreased the occurrence of conflicts and {{played a significant role in}} managing them. However, social capital mechanisms have some limits, and are not always effective in resolving some types of conflicts. For such conflicts, people rely on formal mechanisms for arbitration and adjudication. In many cases, these have resulted in exclusion, coercion, and violence. Results show that policies or social capital alone do not possess the resources needed to promote broad-based and sustainable conflict resolution strategies. Rather, people use a range of conflict management strategies of different types and combinations of social capital and local polices. This synergy between social capital and local policy is based on complementarity and embededness: mutually supportive relations between local government and local communities, and the nature and extent of the ties connecting people and communities and public institutions. Better understanding of how this synergy between social capital and local policy can be strengthened is crucial to minimize natural resource management conflicts. Peer-reviewe...|$|R

Usporedbom s izvorima koji se odnose na predtridentski Dubrovnik i podacima iz matičnih knjiga za 1870. s jedne strane, a uzimanjem u obzir rezultata inozemnih rasprava s druge strane, istražuju se specifičnosti društvenih veza stvaranih kumstvom u suton Dubrovačke Republike. By {{analysing}} {{the data}} of 110 baptisms registered in the Dubrovnik parish baptism records for the year 1770, we aim to reconstruct how godparenthood {{was used as a}} device for improving the family’s position in the community by establishing ties with the persons of higher social capital (Bourdieu). Although the baptismal records of Dubrovnik for the period before the Council of Trent have not been preserved, several personal records of baptism traced in the noble families indicate that godparents were numerous, mostly male, and that godparenthood was used to reinforce the family relationships and moreover to create and to widen the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>social</b> <b>networks,</b> which also included the commoners. With regard to its forms and objectives, the role of godparenthood practiced in Dubrovnik was identical to that in Italy and other South-European societies of the same period. By limiting the number of godparents, the decrees of the Council of Trent significantly narrowed the potential of this institute in creating and extending the social relations. The godparent-parent relationship of the second half of eighteenth-century was upwardly mobile, i. e. the godparent was chosen from a rank higher than that of the godchild’s parents. Most commonly, the nobility and the urban elite chose godparents among the relatives, while the common people tended to use godparenthood for creating new social relationships and for bettering their position in the community. The nobility acting as godparents to the children of the lower ranks were almost never present at the rite of baptism, and they sent their representatives (proxies) instead, which shows that the personal and spiritual character of godparenthood was of secondary importance. When parents and godparents belonged to the same social class, the appointment of representatives was less common. It is clear that parents {{played a central role in}} the selection of representatives, quite contrary to the actual idea of representation. A comparison with the baptisms registered in the same parish in 1870 demonstrates a shift in the role of godparenthood, as its potential in creating <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> often remained unexploited. Moreover, the number of godparents from the noble ranks had been largely reduced as a consequence of the diminished social influence of the nobility after the fall of the Republic...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{nature of}} {{environmental}} change in coastal areas {{means that a}} flexible “learning by doing” management strategy {{has a number of}} advantages. This article lays out the principles of such a strategy and then assesses an actual planning and management process focused on climate change consequences for the Broads wetland on the East coast of England. The management strategy focused on the concept of ecosystem services (stocks and flows) provided by the coastal wetland and the threats and opportunities posed to the area by sea level rise and other climate change impacts. The analysis explores the process by which an adaptive management plan has been formulated and coproduced by a combination of centralized (<b>vertical)</b> and stakeholder <b>social</b> <b>network</b> (horizontal) arrangements. The process values where feasible the ecosystem services under threat and prioritizes response actions. Coastal management needs a careful balance between strategic requirements imposed at a national scale and local schemes that affect regional and/or local communities and <b>social</b> <b>networks.</b> These networks aided by electronic media have allowed groups to engage more rapidly and effectively with policy proposals. However, successful deliberation is conditioned by a range of context specific factors, including the type of <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> present and their relative competitive and/or complementary characteristics. The history of consultation and dialogue between official agencies and stakeholders also plays a part in contemporary deliberation processes and the success of their outcomes. Among the issues highlighted are the multiple dimensions of nature's value; the difficulty of quantifying some ecosystem service changes, especially for cultural services; and the problem of “stakeholder fatigue” complicating engagement arrangements...|$|R
40|$|To {{be part of}} a {{minority}} group in nowadays society is becoming a recurrent practise of communication. Everyone shares opinions or comments or simply is „follower‖ of something or someone. Zuniga (2012) tested how much the usage of a <b>social</b> <b>network</b> plays a ―virtuous circle‖ for democratic process of civic and political participation. This could help us to go more in depth on the process of on line political participation by distinguishing structures, modes and contents of social network‘ s use. As to the structures we can identify <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>social</b> <b>networks,</b> and within the vertical one a political leader can built a more closed relation with his voters by means of constructive or negative techniques like ―daily updating‖ (Morpeau, 2011) or by ―provoking‖ and attacking a ―scapegoat‖ (D‘Errico et al, 2014). The communication strategies can affect on line dynamics of trust and political reactions. Another slice of on line political communication is the one based on horizontal structures formed by ―active minorities‖ promoting advanced form of social activism, viewed as a kind of participation in which individuals engage actions as members of a group with the aim of improving their conditions (Wright et al., 1990). On line social activism is linked to individual and social empowerment processes, but in what sense? When horizontal <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> are source of personal and social reinforcement?

Indeed, the two separate concepts are arguably vital in rural development but the study described in this thesis is among the first to systematically link <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> and road infrastructure in rural development. This qualitative indepth research has a twofold focus as it seeks to assess the role of <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> in the lives and development of inhabitants of rural remote areas and to investigate the role of roads and mobility in creating, accessing and functioning of those networks. This research shows how <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> operate and how they depend on- and are influenced by a recently constructed road in a case study village in the Northern Ethiopian Tigray region. The findings are based on 3 focus-group discussions with network members, 31 semi-structured interviews with inhabitants of the village that participate in various networks and 11 interviews with leaders of networks and government officials. 	Although membership is often self-evident or even obligatory, <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> appear to constitute people’s lives significantly in the case study. The results indeed indicate that both formal and informal as well as <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> play a large role in sustaining the lives of people in the rural village. Formal networks appear to be highly institutionalized, recently created and controlled by the government and aimed at economic, financial, employment or knowledge benefits. The informal networks on the other hand are century-old local traditions of charity and helping the community. Mainly based on reciprocity of the community membership rates of the informal networks appear very high compared to the formal networks. 	Regarding the road, although people are generally satisfied about the newly constructed road in their village, the effect of the road on <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> appears limited. Altogether the data does not indicate the creation of new networks or disappearance of old ones because of the road construction. Neither does it suggest major changes in the way the existing networks operate. Some perceived effects however are found in the data: the main changes in <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> that respondents attributed to the rural road and increased mobility potential are an increase in frequency of meetings in vertical networks, an overall modest decrease in travel time and easier and comfortable journeys, the latter being especially true for groups less physically vital network members. Altogether, although roads can thus reinforce <b>social</b> <b>networks,</b> the issue of limited available and affordable (public) transport is problematic. As a result of this, virtually all social trips within the village to both formal and informal network meetings are made on foot which is a time-consuming matter. 	 After critically reviewing these results, this thesis concludes by stating that ‘the social’ in general and more specifically <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> should be included as a factor in rural road appraisal, both by researcher and policy makers. Similarly, research on <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> in rural development should adopt mobility as a relevant factor in assessing livelihood effects of networks. The ‘transport disadvantage’ of poor members of a network should be continuously included in these assessments...|$|R

Geographic distance influence mobile <b>social</b> <b>network</b> and online <b>social</b> <b>network</b> differently. Communica-tion in online <b>social</b> <b>network</b> is less location-sensitive than mobile <b>social</b> <b>network.</b> User communication in mobile <b>social</b> <b>network</b> is in better accordance with social theories, whereas in online <b>social</b> <b>network</b> it performs inconsistently. To the best of our knowledge this work is the first quan-titative communication comparison between mobile and on-line <b>social</b> <b>network...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} a novel framework for ubiquitous <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> (USNs). Instead of making virtual connections, {{on the basis}} of human <b>social</b> <b>networks,</b> an effort has been made to facilitate interactions among human <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> with the help of virtual <b>social</b> <b>networks.</b> The imperative domains that support ubiquitous <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> are highlighted and different scenarios are provided to project real world applications of proposed framework. Our proposed framework can provide preliminary foundations for creating “ubiquitous <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> ” in true essence...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between a CEO’s <b>social</b> <b>network,</b> firm identity, and firm performance. There are two competing theories that predict contradictory outcomes. Following <b>social</b> <b>network</b> theory, one would expect a positive relation between <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> and firm performance, while agency theory in general and Bebchuk’s managerial power approach in particular predicts a negative relationship between <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> and firm performance. Based on a new and comprehensive measure of CEOs <b>social</b> <b>networks,</b> we observe for 363 non-financial firms in the UK that the size of a CEO’s <b>social</b> <b>network</b> affects firm performance negatively. Even so, growth companies are actively seeking CEOs with a large <b>social</b> <b>network,</b> which is in line with the <b>social</b> <b>network</b> theory. Still, we find evidence in support of the argument that well-connected CEOs use the power they obtain through their <b>social</b> <b>network</b> to the detriment of shareholders. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide {{evidence}} that digital <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> look fundamentally different from <b>social</b> <b>networks.</b> We show that online <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> look like a contagion spread over traditional models for <b>social</b> <b>networks.</b> Thus, if these tradi-tional models are correct, then digital <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> and <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> differ in key properties, and we will need different models to describe each. This also indicates that using data from digital <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> may mislead us {{if we try to}} use it to directly infer the structure of <b>social</b> <b>networks.</b> Additionally, we describe a framework that we call “poten-tial networks ” that may help to use information from digital networks to infer the structure of <b>social</b> <b>networks.</b> Poten-tial networks is a two phase model of <b>social</b> <b>networks.</b> The first phase is the“potential”network. However, this network may not be directly observed and might not even exist an any normal manner. A random process is run over a po-tential network to produce a behavioral network, the second phase, which can be observed. We then discuss applications of this two-phase framework...|$|R
40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>network</b> {{analysis}} and visualization {{is an active}} area of study but good organizations of <b>social</b> <b>network</b> information are lacking. This paper proposes a domain ontologies model focusing on <b>social</b> <b>network</b> information, which abstracts the impersonal existences in <b>social</b> <b>network</b> information domain into some primary ontologies. The model is suitable for describing {{a wide variety of}} <b>social</b> <b>network</b> {{analysis and}} visualization methods. For overcoming the disadvantage of transitional force directed layout algorithms in <b>social</b> <b>network</b> structure analysis, we propose a <b>Social</b> <b>Network</b> Analysis Layout (SNAL) algorithm based on domain ontologies model. SNAL algorithm analyses the subgroups, the roles and the key attributes in <b>social</b> <b>network.</b> Then the results are used to improve the force directed layout algorithm, in both 2 D and 3 D visualization. Results with the case of terrorist information demonstrate its advantages in analyzing and displaying the structure of <b>social</b> <b>network...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>Social</b> <b>Network</b> Analysis (SNA) is {{becoming}} an important tool for investigators, but all the necessary information is often available in a distributed environment. Currently there is no information system that helps managers and team leaders monitor {{the status of a}} <b>social</b> <b>network.</b> This chapter presents an overview of the basic concepts of <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> in data analysis including <b>social</b> <b>network</b> analysis metrics and performances. Different problems in <b>social</b> <b>networks</b> are discussed such as uncertainty, missing data and finding the shortest path in a <b>social</b> <b>network.</b> Community structure, detection and visualization in <b>social</b> <b>network</b> analysis is also illustrated. This chapter bridges the gap among the users by combining <b>social</b> <b>network</b> analysis methods and information visualization technology to help a user visually identify the occurrence of a possible relationship amongst the members in a <b>social</b> <b>network.</b> The chapter illustrates an online visualization method for a DBL...|$|R
