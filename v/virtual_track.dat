50|$|The {{system is}} based on roller {{platforms}} that allow several cars or motorcycles to drag race while remaining in a stationary position. By borrowing standard dynamometer technology and combining it with new telemetry and electronic displays, the Showdown VRS simulates the actual track conditions of an asphalt quarter mile drag strip. As the competitor’s cars exert force to turn large rollers positioned under their tires, distance, speed, and other data is measured to determine how fast a driver makes it down the <b>virtual</b> <b>track.</b> The results of the race, displayed for {{the crowd at the}} end of each match, show speed, elapsed time (ET) and other relevant conditions like torque, horsepower, and reaction time.|$|E

A Lane Departure Warning System helps to keep the vehicle in its lane and automatically warns, if it drifts away from the lane. A Collision Warning System supports the driver on keeping a safe distance with other vehicles on the road and if the proximity reduces below a given level, it alerts the driver by a warning sign. The Route Change Authorization is navigation device, which analyzes the traffic conditions on the chosen route and can recommend a detour to avoid traffic congestion. The Electronic Rearview Mirrors work with remotely adjustable cameras and provide a clearer view than conventional mirrors including an auto dimming device to reduce the glare.|$|E

30|$|Interaction {{with the}} virtual model via the nine {{functions}} in the NavisWorks Roamer seemed to be as natural and intuitive as in the MR system according to the ratings (NavisWorks: Mean, 3.26; S.D., 1.03; MR: Mean, 3.87; S.D., 0.64). The difference is insignificant according to the p-value[*]>[*] 0.05, and therefore Hypothesis 3 is not supported. This similarity can be explained as the trade-off between the unnaturalness of MR due to the demand of more physical effort and the intuitiveness of interaction with the virtual model via the <b>virtual</b> <b>tracking</b> ball. The subjects assessed the level of immersion for the MR system at an average rating of 4.37 (S.D., 0.81) compared with 2.73 (S.D., 0.88) for the NavisWorks Roamer with a significant p-value indication, which strongly implies that the MR system provides the users {{a greater sense of}} being present with the model.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a navigation system for truck-trailer combinations that enables accurate maneuvering to a target position, either assisted or automated. Functional and collision-free motion {{is achieved by}} a combination of laser scanner-based navigation and multimodal motion planning. The navigation system uses laser range data to recognize target objects and calculates corresponding target positions. The grid-based multi-dimensional path planner generates a collision-free minimum-cost trajectory for truck-trailer combinations with up to ve degrees of freedom. The multimodal planner decides whether the approach is planned as a single backward motion, as a maneuvering path with reversal points or as a long distance approach using free navigation and <b>virtual</b> <b>tracks.</b> Optimized planning algorithms are used for each case. The complete system has been successfully tested using a combination of a Mercedes-Benz truck and a full trailer under varying environmental conditions. The test application was an assistance system for backward driving under a swap body a very challenging application due to its strict accuracy requirements. The results promise high benets for this and further applications. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of wear due to wheel–rail interaction {{is a fundamental}} aspect in the railway field, mainly correlated to safety, maintenance interventions and costs. In this work, the authors present an innovative wheel profile optimisation procedure, specifically designed {{with the aim of}} improving the wear and stability behaviour of the standard ORE S 1002 wheel profile matched with the UIC 60 rail profile canted at 1 / 20 rad, which represents the wheel–rail combination adopted in Italian railway line; this matching shows poor wear performance due to the non-conformal contact. A new wheel profile, conventionally named DR 2, has been developed by the authors in collaboration with Trenitalia S. p. A. The DR 2 wheel profile is designed to guarantee the same kinematic characteristics of the matching formed by ORE S 1002 wheel profile and UIC 60 rail profile with inclination angle p equal to 1 / 40 rad, widely common in European railways and characterised by good performances in both wear and kinematic behaviour. The evolution of wheel profiles due to wear has been evaluated through a wear model developed and validated by the authors in previous works. In the present research the investigated trainset is the passenger vehicle ALSTOM ALn 501 ‘‘Minuetto’’, which is usually equipped with wheelsets having the standard ORE S 1002 wheel profile in Italian railways. The entire model has been simulated on a <b>virtual</b> <b>track</b> specifically developed to represent a statistical description of the whole Italian line; the innovative statistical approach has been employed to obtain accurate results in reasonable computational times.

30|$|Frequency-domain {{analysis}} is another {{common type of}} random vibration analysis [6]. Many studies [7, 8, 9] on the random vibration of a vehicle–track system have employed frequency-domain analysis. To improve the efficiency of computation, Lin and Zhang [10] put forward a pseudo-excitation method. The pseudo-excitation method was then adopted by Lu et al. [11] and Zhang et al. [12, 13] to analyze the vertical random vibration of a vehicle–track coupled system. This method regards the track structure as a periodic structure and solves the spreading of harmonic <b>virtual</b> <b>track</b> irregularity excitation in the track substructure with a symplectic mathematics method. This method needs only four stress track substructures in the calculation, which greatly reduces the number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) and greatly improves the calculation efficiency. Employing the pseudo-excitation method, Zhang et al. [14] studied the random vibration of the vehicle–slab track coupled system and analyzed {{the effects of the}} vehicle speed and slab track parameters on the random vibration of the system.|$|E
40|$|Currently {{only a few}} {{motorcycle}} simulators exist, few or none {{of which}} are used during the development of real vehicles.

In this work the motorcycle simulator of the University of Padova is employed to assess its possible usage in the development phase of real vehicles. The ultimate objective is using the simulator to evaluate the handling of a specific motorcycle in a specific configuration. Lab tests, numerical simulations, road tests with on-board telemetry, and simulator tests have been employed during this research.

40|$|A key {{component}} of any interactive computer graphics application is the system for tracking user or input device motion. An accurate estimate of the position and/or orientation of the <b>virtual</b> world <b>tracking</b> targets is critical to effectively creating a convincing <b>virtual</b> experience. <b>Tracking</b> {{is one of the}} pillars upon which a virtual reality environment is built and it imposes a fundamental limit on how real the “reality ” of Virtual Reality can be. Whether working on a new or modified tracking system, designers typically begin the design process with requirements for the working volume, the expected user motion, and the infrastructure. Considering these requirements they develop a candidate design that includes one or more tracking mediums (optical, acoustic, etc.), associated source/sensor devices (hardware), and an algorithm (software) for combining the information from the devices. They then simulate the candidate system to estimate the performance for some specific motion paths. Thus the predictions of such traditional simulations typically include the combined effect of hardware and algorithm choices, but only for the chosen motion paths. Before tracker algorithm selection, and irrespective of the motion paths, it is the choice and configuration of the source/sensor devices that are critical to performance. Th...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{and visit the}} {{limitation}} of reference point group mobility model. It assumes that nodes in the same group always stay together throughout the simulation process. However, in many real life applications, the nodes’s movement within a group is not always common. In particular, in a military operation, initially {{there is only one}} group. With multiple missions assigned to it, the group may be divided into a number of subgroups with each subgroup moving to a different location for accomplishing its task. A subgroup may be further divided into smaller groups or merge with other subgroups after completing its task. In the urban environment, the convoys of cars running on the street can split at the intersections. Therefore, in many real life scenarios mobile nodes (MNs) dynamically re-configure themselves triggering group partition and mergence; MNs sometimes merge and move together and sometimes split and move individually and independently. Some recent researches present mobility models such as reference region group mobility model or <b>virtual</b> <b>track</b> based group mobility model, which model possible group partitioning and group merging.

30|$|The image {{processing}} and communication systems are now very well developed and designed {{and they are}} able to support applications for safety and railway safety (the majority of applications are developed for road transport) [3]. Pattern recognition, in terms of image analysis, could be a good solution to detect the presence of the rolling stock on a specific monitored area. The application of pattern recognition could increase the efficiency of the method in terms of providing additional information about an object placed on the rails, the physical obstacle between the camera and the rails. Various methods of pattern recognition were defined and tested and one of them could be selected to be applied in this research (the next stage of the research) [4]. This is the reason to introduce a new type of track circuit which is based on {{image processing}}. The main issue of this <b>virtual</b> <b>track</b> circuit is to demonstrate that this solution is able to provide the same level of safety as classical track circuit based on using tracks as wires for an emitter–receiver system. This demonstration is based on comparative assessment of those two different sensing solutions (a model of this assessment came from decision support systems domain) [5].|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this delivery was to demonstrate the feasibility of using the <b>virtual</b> <b>track</b> {{for the development of}} enhanced Child Restraint Systems. Physical development requires the availability of physical dummies, test setups, CRS prototypes as well as injury criteria and limits. In the same way, virtual development first requires virtual dummies and CRS and test setup models. In that particular case, injury criteria and limits can be the same for physical development. However, all the components of this approach have to be validated and have to demonstrate their ability to mimic reality. In addition to this, human body models were developed aiming at a better understanding of injury mechanisms and better predictions of injuries. These models may also be used to go further in the development of enhanced CRS. However, whereas their potential is higher than dummy models, their level of validation requires much more attention and data. This is all the more important as we can not physically check the results. The analysis of the work performed in CASPER shows that dummy models together with CRS models, setups and criteria are almost mature and can be used to help develop CRS.
