40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{comparative}} advantage of Indonesian commodities in order to enter the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). This study uses the export data during the period of 2003 - 2013 among five ASEAN countries participating in the AEC, including Indonesia, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. All data obtained from the UN Comtrade database following the Harmonized System (HS) at the two-digit classification level. This study applies dynamic revealed comparative advantage (DRCA) index developed by Edwards and Schoer (2001) which is the development of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index by Balassa (1965). The results show that Indonesia is ready to enter the AEC. From this research, there are several Indonesian main commodities which have comparative advantage in ASEAN, including fish, crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic invertebrates ones (HS- 03), edible fruit, nuts, peel of citrus fruit, melons (HS- 08), oil seed, oleagic fruits, grain, seed, fruit, etc, nes (HS- 12), lac, gums, resins, <b>vegetable</b> <b>saps</b> <b>and</b> <b>extracts</b> nes (HS- 13), rubber and articles thereof (HS- 40), paper & paperboard, articles of pulp, paper and board (HS- 48), special woven or tufted fabric, lace, tapestry etc (HS- 58), articles apparel, accessories, not knit or crochet (HS- 62), and vehicles other than railway, tramway (HS- 87). Those commodities are in line with Indonesian government export's strategy direction which mainly focuses on several sectors, including fishery, vegetable products, rubber, wood and wood products, textiles, and transportation. Therefore, Indonesian government should focus to improve those commodities in AEC.

40|$|We report {{experiments}} {{to quantify the}} relationships between the relative abundance of ureide-N in root-bleeding <b>sap,</b> vacuum-extracted <b>sap,</b> <b>and</b> hot water <b>extracts</b> of stems <b>and</b> petioles of nodulated soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merrill cv Bragg) and the proportion of plant N derived from nitrogen fixation. Additional experiments examined the effects of plant genotype and strain of rhizobia on these relationships. In each of the five experiments reported, plants of cv Bragg (experiment 1), cv Lincoln (experiments 3, 4, 5), or six cultivars/genotypes (experiment 2) were grown in a sand:vermiculite mixture in large pots in a naturally lit, temperature-controlled glasshouse during summer. Pots were inoculated at sowing with effective Bradyrhizobium japonicum CB 1809 (USDA 136) or with one of 21 different strains of rhizobia. The proportions of plant N derived from nitrogen fixation were determined using 15 N dilution. In one experiment with CB 1809, plants were supplied throughout growth with either N-free nutrients or with nutrients supplemented with 1, 2, 4, or 8 millimolar 15 N-nitrate and harvested on eight occasions between V 6 and R 7 for root-bleeding sap, vacuum-extracted sap, stems (including petioles), and whole plant dry matter. Analyses of the <b>saps</b> <b>and</b> stem <b>extracts</b> for ureides (allantoin plus allantoic acid), α-amino-N, and nitrate, and of dry matter for N and 15 N, indicated a positive effect of nitrate supply on concentrations of nitrate in <b>saps</b> <b>and</b> <b>extracts</b> <b>and</b> a negative effect on ureides and on the proportion of plant N derived from nitrogen fixation. The relative abundance of ureide-N in root-bleeding sap, vacuum-extracted sap (100 [ureide-N]/[ureide-N+ α-amino-N + nitrate-N]) <b>and</b> stem <b>extracts</b> (100 [ureide-N]/[ureide-N + nitrate-N]) and the proportion of plant N, derived from nitrogen fixation between successive samplings were highly correlated (r = 0. 97 - 1. 00). For each variable, two standard curves were prepared to account for the shifts in the compositions of N solutes of xylem <b>saps</b> <b>and</b> <b>extracts</b> after flowering which were not related to a change in nitrogen fixation. Relationships between relative ureide-N and the proportion of plant N derived from nitrogen fixation were not affected by plant genotype or by strain of rhizobia. Therefore, assessment of nitrogen fixation by soybean using the ureide technique should now be possible with the standard curves presented, irrespective of genotype or strain of rhizobia occupying the nodules...|$|R

40|$|Spinach (Spinacia oleracea var “Yates”) {{plants in}} hydroponic culture {{were exposed to}} {{stepwise}} increased concentrations of NaCl or NaNO 3 up to a final concentration of 300 millimoles per liter, at constant Ca 2 +-concentration. Leaf cell <b>sap</b> <b>and</b> <b>extracts</b> from aqueously isolated spinach chloroplasts were analyzed for mineral cations, anions, amino acids, sugars, and quarternary ammonium compounds. Total osmolality of leaf <b>sap</b> <b>and</b> photosynthetic capacity of leaves were also measured. For comparison, leaf sap from salt-treated pea plants was also analyzed. Spinach plants under NaCl or NaNO 3 salinity took up large amounts of sodium (up to 400 millimoles per liter); nitrate as the accompanying anion was taken up less (up to 90 millimoles per liter) than chloride (up to 450 millimoles per liter). Under chloride salinity, nitrate content in leaves decreased drastically, but total amino acid concentrations remained constant. This response was much more pronounced (and occurred at lower salt concentrations) in leaves from the glycophyte (pea, Pisum sativum var “Kleine Rheinländerin”) than from moderately salt-tolerant spinach. In spinach, sodium chloride or nitrate taken up into leaves was largely sequestered in the vacuoles; both salts induced synthesis of quarternary ammonium compounds, which were accumulated mainly in chloroplasts (and cytosol). This prevented impairment of metabolism, as indicated by an unchanged photosynthetic capacity of leaves...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Change {{projects}} try {{to optimize}} business processes and structures {{and seek to}} make better use of the resources across the enterprise. In these change projects, business process models are commonly applied to represent both the current and future situation. These models {{have the ability to}} show how resources like employees, data, and departments are related to business operations. However, existing business process models lack the abilities both to show load distribution through process flows and to treat capabilities and performance of resources individually. We will in this paper describe how identifiers of past business performance can be incorporated into business models, thus providing a communicative source of information where many potential improvements can be grasped instantly. The approach is supported by an application called Enterprise Visualization Suite that analyzes transactional data from <b>SAP</b> R/ 3 <b>and</b> <b>extract</b> empirical models of the business flow. ...|$|R
40|$|Self-entropy (SE) and {{transfer}} entropy (TE) are widely utilized in biomedical signal processing {{to assess the}} information stored into a system {{and transfer}}red from a source to a destination respectively. The study proposes a more specific definition of the SE, namely the conditional SE (CSE), and a more flexible definition of the TE based on joint TE (JTE), namely the conditional JTE (CJTE), {{for the analysis of}} information dynamics in multivariate time series. In a protocol evoking a gradual sympathetic activation and vagal withdrawal proportional to the magnitude of the orthostatic stimulus, such as the graded head-up tilt, we extracted the beat-to-beat spontaneous variability of heart period (HP), systolic arterial pressure (<b>SAP)</b> <b>and</b> respiratory activity (R) in 19 healthy subjects and we computed SE of HP, CSE of HP given <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R, JTE from <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R to HP, CJTE from <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R to HP given <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> CJTE from <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R to HP given R. CSE of HP given <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R was significantly smaller than SE of HP and increased progressively with the amplitude of the stimulus, thus suggesting that dynamics internal to HP <b>and</b> unrelated to <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R, possibly linked to sympathetic activation evoked by head-up tilt, might play a role during the orthostatic challenge. While JTE from <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R to HP was independent of tilt table angle, CJTE from <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R to HP given R <b>and</b> from <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R to HP given SAP showed opposite trends with tilt table inclination, thus suggesting that the importance of the cardiac baroreflex increases and the relevance of the cardiopulmonary pathway decreases during head-up tilt. The study demonstrates the high specificity of CSE and the high flexibility of CJTE over real data and proves that they are particularly helpful in disentangling physiological mechanisms and in assessing their different contributions to the overall cardiovascular regulation...|$|R
40|$|A full {{decomposition}} of the predictive entropy (PE) of the spontaneous {{variations of the}} heart period (HP) given systolic arterial pressure (<b>SAP)</b> <b>and</b> respiration (R) is proposed. The PE of HP is decomposed into the joint transfer entropy (JTE) from <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R to HP and self-entropy (SE) of HP. The SE {{is the sum of}} three terms quantifying the synergistic/redundant contributions of HP <b>and</b> <b>SAP,</b> when taken individually and jointly, to SE and one term conditioned on HP <b>and</b> <b>SAP</b> denoted as the conditional SE (CSE) of HP given <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R. The JTE from <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R to HP is the sum of two terms attributable to SAP or R plus an extra term describing the redundant/synergistic contribution to the JTE. All quantities were computed during cardiopulmonary loading induced by - 25 degrees head-down tilt (HDT) via a multivariate linear regression approach. We found that: i) the PE of HP decreases during HDT; ii) the decrease of PE is attributable to a lessening of SE of HP, while the JTE from <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R to HP remains constant; iii) the SE of HP is dominant over the JTE from <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R to HP and the CSE of HP given <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R is prevailing over the SE of HP due to <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R both in supine position and during HDT; iv) all terms of the decompositions of JTE from <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R to HP and SE of HP due to <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R were not affected by HDT; v) the decrease of the SE of HP during HDT was attributed to the reduction of the CSE of HP given <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R; vi) redundancy of <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> R is prevailing over synergy in the information transferred into HP both in supine position and during HDT, while in the HP information storage synergy and redundancy are more balanced. The approach suggests that the larger complexity of the cardiac control during HDT is unrelated to the baroreflex control and cardiopulmonary reflexes and may be related to central commands and/or modifications of the dynamical properties of the sinus node...|$|R

Minocycline passes the blood-brain barrier and is presumed to inhibit microglial activation. In Alzheimer's disease brain, a number of proteins, including serum amyloid P component (<b>SAP)</b> <b>and</b> complement factors such as C 1 q, accumulate in amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques. In a previous study, <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> C 1 q {{were found to be}} required for clustering of activated microglia in Abeta plaques. Furthermore, <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> C 1 q enhanced Abeta fibril formation and Abeta mediated cytokine release by human microglia in vitro. In the present study, we report that tetracycline and minocycline dose-dependently reduce TNF-alpha and IL- 6 release by adult human microglia upon stimulation with a combination of Abeta, <b>SAP,</b> <b>and</b> C 1 q.

40|$|Serum amyloid P (<b>SAP)</b> <b>and</b> C-reactive protein (CRP) are {{proteins}} {{involved in}} innate immunity. The expression of <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> CRP is increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue, compared to healthy controls. Although both proteins {{are found in}} cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), their origin is unclear. We investigated if increased local production of <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> CRP in AD brain results in higher levels in CSF {{with the use of}} index values. To study this, <b>SAP,</b> CRP, <b>and</b> albumin levels were determined in CSF and serum samples of 30 control (65 ± 11 years; 57 % female) and 140 AD subjects (65 ± 9 years; 53 % female). To correct for inter-individual differences in protein diffusion from blood to CSF, quotients (Q =CSF/serum) of <b>SAP,</b> CRP, <b>and</b> albumin and index values (Qprotein/Qalb) were calculated. The results showed no significant differences in <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> CRP index values between control and AD subjects, although eight percent of individual AD patients showed evidence of intrathecal SAP or CRP production using the Reiber hyperbolic model. Interestingly, the SAP index value was much lower than expected, based on its molecular size. In conclusion, these data suggest that local production of <b>SAP</b> <b>and</b> CRP in the AD brain does not substantially contribute to the CSF levels. © 2010 - IOS Press and the authors.

40|$|The common human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, {{possesses}} {{at least}} nine genes encoding secreted aspartic proteinases (SAPs). Saps are widely regarded as virulence factors, despite historical controversy surrounding their actual roles in the onset and development of candidosis. While Sap 1, <b>Sap</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>Sap</b> 3 had been previously studied at the biochemical level, <b>Sap</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Sap</b> 5 had not been detected, purified or characterised. To facilitate analysis of the proteins, <b>SAP</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>SAP</b> 5 were amplified by PCR and cloned. The nucleotide changes in SAP 4 were silent, <b>and</b> <b>SAP</b> 5 contained one conserved amino acid substitution, compared with the published sequences. The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris {{was used as a}} host for heterologous expression of <b>SAP</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>SAP</b> 5, <b>and</b> the respective proteins were purified to homogeneity. Purification of Sap 4 involved Mono Q anion exchange chromatography at pH 7. 0, while Sap 5 was purified by cation exchange chromatography on Resource S at pH 7. 0. C. albicans SAP 1 was also over-expressed in P. pastoris as a control. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant proteins revealed that <b>Sap</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Sap</b> 5 were optimally active at pH 4. 5, 1 - 2 pH units higher than the optima of <b>Saps</b> 1, 2 <b>and</b> 3. At optimum pH, the specific activities of <b>Sap</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Sap</b> 5 were 239 and 33 µg tyrosine equivalents/min, respectively. These isoenzymes also retained significant activity at pH 7. 0, which suggested roles in the disease process at host sites of neutral pH. <b>Sap</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Sap</b> 5 showed decreased specific activity towards denatured globin, and increased specific activity towards a fluorocasein substrate, when compared with Saps 1 - 3. Substrate specificity analyses (performed using a peptide substrate, glucagon, and MALDI-TOF of the purified peptide fragments), showed that <b>Sap</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Sap</b> 5 hydrolysed the glucagon at the same sites, but the analysis did not reveal a consensus cleavage sequence. The deduced masses of Sap 1, <b>Sap</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Sap</b> 5 were 36, 179, 36, 995 and 37, 256, respectively. However, ES-MS indicated the masses of the recombinant <b>Sap</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sap</b> 4 were larger than expected, by 2232 and 2041 respectively. Glycopeptide fragment ion analysis suggested the additional mass was due to attached sugar residues. Carbohydrate chromatography confirmed the presence of mannose and N-acetyl glucosamine. The presence of N-acetyl glucosamine species, and the lack of consensus N-linked glycosylation sites in the Sap 1, <b>Sap</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>Sap</b> 5 proteins suggests a novel pattern of O-linked glycosylation in P. pastoris.
