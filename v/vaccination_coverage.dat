5|$|Although {{poliovirus}} transmission {{has been}} interrupted {{in much of}} the world, transmission of wild poliovirus does continue and creates an ongoing risk for the importation of wild poliovirus into previously polio-free regions. If importations of poliovirus occur, outbreaks of poliomyelitis may develop, especially in areas with low <b>vaccination</b> <b>coverage</b> and poor sanitation. As a result, high levels of <b>vaccination</b> <b>coverage</b> must be maintained. In November 2013, the World Health Organization announced a polio outbreak in Syria. In response, the Armenian government put out a notice asking Syrian Armenians under age 15 to get the polio vaccine. As of 2014, polio virus has spread out to ten countries mainly in Africa, Asia and the Middle East with Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon advising vaccinations to outbound travelers.|$|E

The first 20 years of licensed measles vaccination in the U.S. prevented an estimated 52 million cases of the disease, 17,400 cases of intellectual disability, and 5,200 deaths. During 1999–2004, a strategy led by the World Health Organization and UNICEF led to improvements in measles <b>vaccination</b> <b>coverage</b> that averted an estimated 1.4 million measles deaths worldwide.

40|$|Summary: Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{situation}} and evolution of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome in Spain and to evaluate the objective of elimination proposed by the World Health Organization for the European Region. Methods: Analysis {{of the evolution of}} rubella incidence and <b>vaccination</b> <b>coverages</b> (l 980 and 2007). Morbidity data were obtained from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network and mortality and population data from the National Institute of Statistics. Results: In 1979, a policy of selective rubella vaccination was introduced in Spain, targeting 11 -year-old girls. In 1981, immunisation with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine was introduced, at 15 months of age and a second dose was introduced in 1995. <b>Vaccination</b> <b>coverages</b> since 1999 exceed 95 % for the first dose and 90 % for the second. The incidence of rubella has fallen drastically to < 1 / 100, 000 since 2000 in all regions. Only small outbreaks or clusters have been detected, except for one large outbreak in Madrid that affected young adult males and fertile women from countries with low <b>vaccination</b> <b>coverages.</b> Since 1997, 13 cases of congenital rubella syndrome have been detected. Conclusions: The situation in Spain favours the elimination of rubella. However, pockets of susceptible subjects remain, mainly young adult males and immigrants, who have increased substantially in numbers in the last decade. Fertile women with high birth rates from countries with a high rubella incidence have a high risk of congenital rubella syndrome...|$|R

40|$|We used a {{structured}} population model to study factors determining {{the magnitude of}} indirect protection in Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccination. On a simulation platform mimicking the population of Finland, a Hib transmission and immunity model, including cross-reactive bacterial encounters, was formulated. Utilizing different <b>vaccination</b> <b>coverages</b> and vaccine types we could study how fast the incidence of Hib disease declined due to direct and indirect vaccination effects. With the Finnish vaccination schedule we could reproduce the observed disappearance of Hib cases. Our results show that an indirect effect was already significant with a relatively low vaccine coverage, even with a vaccine only partly reducing carriage acquisition. This suggests that the vaccination schedule and vaccine to be used should be chosen to result, in addition to immunological memory, in high antibody concentrations, sufficient to reduce carriage, the latter being the main factor behind successful elimination of transmission and disease...|$|R
40|$|What {{this paper}} adds box • Infants of women vaccinated against measles receive less {{maternal}} antibodies {{and are therefore}} shorter protected compared to infants of women with naturally acquired immunity, according to previous studies. Is the amount of maternal antibodies still sufficient to protect infants until the first vaccination dose is administered, {{in the era of}} changing measles epidemiology with increasing <b>vaccination</b> <b>coverages</b> and low endemicity of measles? • The results of the present longitudinal study with 7 different time-points of antibody measurement in infants until the age of 1 year, show an increasing gap of susceptibility between the loss of maternal antibodies and the administration of a first vaccine dose, not only in infants of vaccinated women but also in infants of women with naturally acquired immunity. Lowering the age of first vaccination, however, could jeopardize the immune response to the currently available vaccine. This study certainly underlines the importance of timeliness of administration of a first measles containing vaccine at 12 months of age and supports the vaccination of infants under the age of 1 year in case of measles outbreaks or travelling or migrating infants to endemic areas...|$|R
40|$|In Germany, mumps {{has been}} {{notifiable}} until 2013 {{only in the}} five Eastern federal states (EFS) of former East Germany. Due to different immunisation policies until 1990 and varying <b>vaccination</b> <b>coverages</b> thereafter, mumps incidences cannot be extrapolated to the 11 Western federal states (WFS). We studied mumps-related International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 10) code diagnoses claimed through statutory health insurances between 2007 and 2011 to estimate countrywide mumps incidences in the outpatient sector, and compared them with case numbers from ambulatory notification data. Overall, 32, 330 outpatient mumps cases were claimed. Annual incidence ranged between 9. 3 / 100, 000 and 11. 8 / 100, 000 and showed a significant decreasing trend. Compared with EFS, mumps incidence in WFS was higher and indicated a shift towards older age groups. Notified outpatient case numbers in EFS were 13 -fold lower and from voluntary surveillance during an outbreak in the WFS Bavaria 8 -fold lower than from insurance data (n= 316 versus n= 4, 217 and n= 238 versus 1, 995, respectively). Of all notified cases with available information, 75. 4 % (EFS) and 57. 6 % (Bavaria) were unvaccinated; 6. 8 % (EFS) and 19. 3 % (Bavaria) required hospitalisation.

40|$|Background: Inequalities in {{cervical}} {{cancer may be}} increased following mass vaccination against the human papillomavirus (HPV) if girls with low vaccine uptake also have low future participation in {{cervical cancer}} screening. We evaluated how vaccine uptake distribution affects inequalities in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) incidence between groups with different screen-ing participation. Methods:We used an individual-based transmission dynam-ic model of HPV infection and disease (HPV-ADVISE). Females were stratified by routine screening frequency. We modeled the impact of vaccination on SCC incidence rate differences (absolute inequality) and incidence rate ratios (relative inequality) between women who have routine screen-ing intervals of < 5 years (frequently screened), 5 years (underscreened), and who are never screened. We compared simulations with uniform vaccine uptake with scenarios with unequal vaccine uptake, in which never and underscreened women have lower vaccine uptake than frequently screened women. Results: Absolute SCC inequalities between groups with dif-ferent screening rates were predicted to decrease after vaccination, evenwhenwomenwith the lowest screeningparticipationhad the lowest vaccine uptake. Herd effects helped reduce absolute inequalities when vaccine uptake was unequal. Conversely, rel-ative SCC inequalities remained unchanged or increased after vaccination. Results were robust to different overall <b>vaccination</b> <b>coverages</b> and sexual mixing scenarios. Conclusion: Though mass HPV vaccination is predicted to substantially decrease SCC incidence rates, never screenedwomen will still have the highest disease burden after vaccination. Impact: To reduce both absolute and relative SCC inequalities, public health initiatives will need to address inequalities in both vaccine uptake and in cervical cancer screening participation.

40|$|A dynamic {{deterministic}} {{simulation model}} {{was developed to}} determine the cost-effectiveness of different mass dog vaccination strategies against rabies in a dog population representative of a typical village on Flores Island. Cost-effectiveness was measured as public cost per averted dog-rabies case. Simulations started {{with the introduction of}} one infectious dog into a susceptible dog population of 399 dogs and subsequently ran for a period of 10 years. The base scenario represented a situation without any control intervention. Evaluated vaccination strategies were as follows: annual vaccination campaigns with short-acting vaccine (immunity duration of 52 weeks) (AV_ 52), annual campaigns with long-acting vaccine (immunity duration of 156 weeks) (AV_ 156), biannual campaigns with short-acting vaccine (BV_ 52) and once-in- 2 -years campaigns with long-acting vaccine (O 2 V_ 156). The effectiveness of the vaccination strategies was simulated for <b>vaccination</b> <b>coverages</b> of 50 % and 70 %. Cumulative results were reported for the 10 -year simulation period. The base scenario resulted in three epidemic waves, with a total of 1274 dog-rabies cases. The public cost of applying AV_ 52 at a coverage of 50 % was US$ 5342 for a village. This strategy was unfavourable compared to other strategies, as it was costly and ineffective in controlling the epidemic. The costs of AV_ 52 at a coverage of 70 % and AV_ 156 at a coverage of 70 % were, respectively, US$ 3646 and US$ 3716, equivalent to US$ 3. 00 and US$ 3. 17 per averted dog-rabies case. Increasing the coverage of AV_ 156 from 50 % to 70 % reduced the number of cases by 7 % and reduced the cost by US$ 1452, resulting in a cost-effectiveness ratio of US$ 1. 81 per averted dog-rabies case. This simulation model provides an effective tool to explore the public cost-effectiveness of mass dog vaccination strategies in Flores Island.

40|$|Haemophilus (H.) influenzae is a human-restricted {{bacterial}} pathogen {{that can cause}} severe invasive disease. During the past two decades, the incidence of infections caused by H. influenzae serotype a (Hia) has increased in several parts of the world, particularly in Aboriginal populations of North America. Currently, there is no vaccine available to prevent Hia infection. While efforts continue to develop an anti-Hia vaccine candidate, {{a number of key}} questions must be addressed to ensure that vaccination is effective in curtailing and possibly eliminating Hia from affected populations. In this thesis, we develop mathematical models of Hia transmission and control dynamics and analyze them to address important practical questions. By simulating an in-host antibody boosting model, we predict the timelines and frequency of natural boosting of immunity in order to prevent invasive Hia disease. Using laboratory data collected in a Canadian population, this model indicates that frequent boosting of natural immunity is required to maintain anti-Hia antibodies at levels required to prevent Hia invasive disease. We also develop a stochastic in-host model of immune dynamics to evaluate the immune responses to a bivalent glycoconjugate vaccine against the two serotypes a and b of H. influenzae. In particular, we investigate the effect of such a vaccine on the generation of anti-Hia immune response in the presence of pre-existing immunity to one serotype elicited by prior vaccination or natural infection. Our results suggest that the protection conferred by a bivalent combined vaccine may be affected by the use of carrier protein previously used in H. influenzae serotype b conjugate vaccines. At the population level, we develop the first stochastic model of Hia transmission dynamics to evaluate vaccination strategies and the effect of booster doses. Our results highlight the importance of primary vaccination and timely booster doses of the individual immunity not only for infants, but also for a sizeable portion of susceptible individuals to maintain a high level of herd immunity in the population. Since age {{plays an important role in}} transmission of Hia, we also develop an age-structured model to evaluate vaccination strategies and determine the effect of age-specific <b>vaccination</b> <b>coverages.</b> We discuss the implications of our findings for population health...|$|R
