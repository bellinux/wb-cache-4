50|$|Manifolds {{intended}} for use with sets where a regulator is provided for each cylinder {{are connected to the}} cylinder valves upstream of the cylinder valve seat, to a connecting port provided specifically for this purpose. Two styles of connection are available for this arrangement - face seal, and barrel seal. Face seal connections are similar to the DIN regulator connection seal, and consist of an o-ring in a groove machined into the end of the manifold tube, which is clamped against the face of the <b>valve</b> <b>port</b> by a threaded component. Face seals are simple and rugged, but rely on tight connection for a reliable seal, and do not allow any adjustment for cylinder centre distance. Barrel seals use one or two O-rings in grooves around the end of the manifold tube, which seal against the bore of the <b>valve</b> <b>port.</b> They are usually screwed into the <b>valve</b> <b>port</b> with handed thread, and locked with a lock-nut. They are generally slightly less rugged than face seal manifolds, and more vulnerable to thread damage during assembly, but allow a small amount of cylinder centre distance adjustment, and provide a reliable seal even if not completely tight. Manifolds of this type are commonly supplied in sets comprising a manifold and compatible left and right side cylinder valves with a choice of neck thread specification. The working components for all three valves in the set are usually identical.|$|E

50|$|The {{output power}} of an engine is {{dependent}} on the ability of intake (air-fuel mixture) and exhaust matter to move quickly through valve ports, typically located in the cylinder head. To increase an engine's output power, irregularities in the intake and exhaust paths, such as casting flaws, can be removed, and, with the aid of an air flow bench, the radii of <b>valve</b> <b>port</b> turns and valve seat configuration can be modified to reduce resistance. This process is called porting, and it can be done by hand or with a CNC machine.|$|E

Instead, the engine featured a form of centrifugal oil filter in the hollow rear crankshaft pulley, although all later versions used the more traditional disposable cartridge filters. One of its major innovations was the use of a swirl vortex on the intake <b>valve</b> <b>port</b> which gave very good combustion, and thus both power and economy for this time. This engine proved cheap to build, and several models of different sizes and market segments used this displacement, which survived until 1982, as the ever-present entry level for the Simca 1100.|$|E

5000|$|Cavitation {{can occur}} in control valves. [...] If the actual {{pressure}} drop across the valve {{as defined by the}} upstream and downstream pressures in the system is greater than the sizing calculations allow, pressure drop flashing or cavitation may occur. The change from a liquid state to a vapor state results from the increase in flow velocity at or just downstream of the greatest flow restriction which is normally the <b>valve</b> <b>port.</b> To maintain a steady flow of liquid through a valve the flow velocity must be greatest at the vena contracta or the point where the cross sectional area is the smallest. This increase in flow velocity is accompanied by a substantial decrease in the fluid pressure which is partially recovered downstream as the area increases and flow velocity decreases. This pressure recovery is never completely {{to the level of the}} upstream pressure. If the pressure at the vena contracta drops below the vapor pressure of the fluid bubbles will form in the flow stream. If the pressure recovers after the valve to a pressure that is once again above the vapor pressure, then the vapor bubbles will collapse and cavitation will occur.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{concerns}} over energy security and stricter legislation on automotive exhaust emission limits have triggered greater efforts in utilizing alternatives to petroleum-based fuels. Compressed natural gas (CNG) {{is one of}} the promising candidates in terms of emissions and price. In this paper, methane, the major constituent of natural gas (NG), in used to fuel a Ricardo E 6 engine and run in a port injection operation with open-valve and close-valve injection. The compression ratio is set at 10. 5 : 1. Methane at 30 bar was supplied to the injector and injection length was adjusted to achieve the desired air fuel ratio (AFR). The minimum advance for best torque (MBT) was determined for 1100 rpm speed by measuring the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) for combustion at spark advance between 14 °CA and 35 °CA BTDC. The result is clearly demonstrated that the performance of the open <b>valve</b> <b>port</b> injection (OVPI) is superior to the one of the close <b>valve</b> <b>port</b> injection (CVPI) with better IMEP, fuel conversion efficiency, indicated power and volumetric efficiency. The observation indicates that OVPI shows steadiness of peak pressures shifts toward top dead centre (TDC) as spark ignitions were advanced compared to CVPI. In terms of combustion characteristics, the OVPI operation yields shorter ignition delay and overall burning duration even at the same phasing angle. Therefore, the open valve operation is preferable for NG port injection {{due to the fact that}} injections take place while intake valve is open. It accelerates the charge flow into the cylinder causing higher volumetric efficiency and avoiding the back pressure that happen when high pressure methane is injected while intake valve closes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{combines}} CFD simulation and high-speed observation {{experiments to}} analyze the forming mechanism of high-speed cavitation flowing inside V-groove. It is found that the formation and development of cavitation are greatly affected by the cavitation nucleus, and subjected to two flow patterns, shear flow and vortex. When the groove is shallow or valve opening is small, cavitation inception occurs in the strong shear region near the throttling edge, which {{is related to the}} separation of boundary layer and the wall attachment effect. As the depth of the <b>valve</b> <b>port</b> increases, the reflux becomes stronger {{at the back of the}} throttling edge, which complements the low pressure area generated from the fluid separation. At the same time the pulsation is formed in the downstream due to the large longitudinal velocity gradient, resulting in vortex, and the area of low pressure in the center of vortex also leads to the generation of cavitation...|$|E

Results of analysis indicate that mass has an appreciable effect, but friction plays the major part in restricting flow. The observed fact that the volumetric efficiency is considerably less than 100 percent is attributed to thermal effects.

40|$|A {{variable}} displacement axial piston pump with Pressure compensator and Load Sensing control is coupled to a diesel engine. The pump {{is in an}} open circuit topology for load control in a typical excavator, skid-steer or front loader circuit. The active torque generated by the engine is subject to overloads, due to uncontrolled priority and sum of torque requests from hydrostatic transmission, implements and upper-structure control.

The valve controls the delivery pressure on the load sensing <b>valve</b> <b>port,</b> and the pressure is managed by an electronic system. This circuit architecture allow the designer to use the valve as a variable load sensing system, modifying the load sensing differential pressure depending on working conditions. The control must be in real time and a feed forward control based on the valve characteristic map is useful and helpful but a feedback control is needed to correct the steady state error; a PID and a Sliding mode are superimposed, in order to react to high dynamic transient.

In the goal to lower engine output parasitic losses, a simple rotary <b>valve</b> <b>porting</b> system design is proposed and analyzed. The proposed design concept takes into consideration and combines all the prominent advantages of many ealier mutlitiple design variations over the past century. The inherent primary advantage of such a rotary porting system is the elimination of reciprocating components, thus lowering vibration, and removal of highly stiff springs which contribute to considerable system power loss.
