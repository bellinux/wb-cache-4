50|$|Q fever is {{a disease}} caused by {{infection}} with Coxiella burnetii, a bacterium that affects humans and other animals. This organism is uncommon, but {{may be found in}} cattle, sheep, goats, and other domestic mammals, including cats and dogs. The infection results from inhalation of a spore-like small-cell variant, and from contact with the milk, urine, feces, <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus,</b> or semen of infected animals. Rarely, the disease is tick-borne. The incubation period is 9-40 days. Humans are vulnerable to Q fever, and infection can result from even a few organisms. The bacterium is an obligate intracellular pathogenic parasite.|$|E
50|$|Timing is critical, as {{the window}} and {{opportunity}} for fertilization {{is little more than}} twelve hours from the release of the ovum. To increase the chance of success, the woman's menstrual cycle is closely observed, often using ovulation kits, ultrasounds or blood tests, such as basal body temperature tests over, noting the color and texture of the <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus,</b> and the softness of the nose of her cervix. To improve the success rate of AI, drugs to create a stimulated cycle may be used, but the use of such drugs also results in an increased chance of a multiple birth.|$|E
5000|$|The similar species Cepaea vindobonensis is less {{intensely}} coloured. [...] The grove snail {{is closely}} related to the white-lipped snail, C. hortensis, shares much the same habitat, and has similar shell colour and pattern. The grove snail is usually the larger of the two species when mature, but the principal difference is that the adult grove snail almost always has a dark brown lip to its shell, whilst adults of Cepaea hortensis almost always have a white lip. However, a morph of the grove snail also has a white lip. In areas where lip colour is variable, dissection is necessary: the structure of the love dart is quite different in the two species, as are the <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus</b> glands. A cross-section of the love dart shows a cross with simple blades, whereas that of C. hortensis has bifurcated blades. C. hortensis has 4 or more branches of body light with reddish or brownish hue, upper side often slightly darker, tentacles darker and 15 mm long.|$|E

5000|$|Betts {{returned}} to this {{subject in the}} mid-1980s. She notes that the Billings Method had come under significant criticism, including being {{the subject of an}} inquiry by the Royal Commission on Human Relationships. Betts' research reviews evidence from comprehensive studies on the biological basis of the Billings Method. The evidence shows that even amongst women who monitored both their body temperature and <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus</b> levels, mucus symptoms were [...] "erratic." [...] In one study of 166 women who recorded 1,600 menstrual cycles, 75% of participants could observe mucus in every cycle, while 21% could only notice this sometimes, and the rest couldn't measure mucus at all. Other studies showed that women were more likely to get pregnant using the Billings method than women using other methods, such as the oral contraceptive pill, IUDs, condoms and diaphragms. Most of these women said they either abandoned the Billings method or miscalculated because the method was either [...] "too complicated," [...] or there were [...] "too many rules to follow" [...] or there were [...] "too many qualifications" [...] to observe. Betts argues that while all methods of contraception require that individuals adhere to proper use, the Billings method was still less effective than other methods and she questioned the Government's continued support of this as a primary family planning strategy.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s to mid-1980s, Betts {{examined}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Billings Ovulation Method of contraception, colloquially known as the ovulation or rhythm method. This technique was established in Australia and grew in popularity around the world. Betts notes that despite the introduction of more effective contraceptive methods in 1971, even in the late 1970s, Government funds and facilities were still promoting the ovulation method of contraception. [...] This method requires that couples only practice safe sex during specific times of a woman's ovulation, and by monitoring a woman's <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus.</b> Betts notes that this is an inaccurate method that does not adequately safeguard all women from conception, especially women with irregular menstrual cycles. Betts' research shows that Billings and his colleagues had close associations with the Catholic Church, which strongly advocated this method as the sole way to practice contraception. Betts also showed flaws in the original published research that Billings used to establish his methodology, such as with a limited sample of housewives (only 22 women were studied for one menstrual cycle in a follow up report by Billings). Betts also shows that several other studies excluded cases where pregnancy had occurred amongst women using the ovulation method, which significantly skewed the findings, and gave the impression that the Billings method was more successful in preventing unplanned births than was actually the case. Betts also reviews other data that shows that the ovulation method places the onus on women to regulate sexual activity, and therefore ignoring the social context in which sexual activity takes place. For example, studies showed that women were unable to negotiate abstinence from their husbands during specific times. Betts' research calls attention {{to the way in which}} the ovulation method became institutionalised in hospitals and birth clinics that received funding from Catholic-affiliated institutions. For example, in 1973-1974, Betts notes that the Family Planning Association received $200,000 of Government funding while Catholic family planning agencies received $100,000. In the late 1970s, Betts notes that half of pregnancies were still unplanned. Under these circumstances, Betts argued that Governments should promote methods of contraception that were more reliable.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of the liquid in <b>vaginal</b> discharge is <b>mucus</b> produced by glands of the cervix.

The solid components are exfoliated epithelial cells from the vaginal wall and cervix {{as well as some of}} the bacteria that inhabit the vagina. These bacteria that live in the vagina do not typically cause disease. In fact, they can protect the individual from other infectious and invasive bacteria by producing substances such as lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide that inhibit growth of other bacteria. The normal composition of bacteria in the vagina (vaginal flora) can vary, but is most commonly dominated by lactobacilli. On average, there are approximately 108 to 109 bacteria per milliliter of vaginal discharge.|$|R

40|$|Progesterone, 5 -pregnene- 3, 20 -dione, and {{desoxycorticosterone}} {{were found}} to be partial but significant inhibitors of estrone-induced growth of the uterus of hypophysectomized rats but they did not depress the amount of growth elicited by testosterone. The presence of both the 2 -carbon side chain at position 17 and an oxygenated function at position 3 is necessary for the inhibitory activity of progesterone. The introduction of a hydroxyl group in the progesterone molecule at positions 6 (β), 11 (α), 16 (α) or 17 (α) destroyed its growth-inhibitory activity. 11 β-Hydroxyprogesterone is weaker than progesterone in the inhibition of estrone-induced uterine growth; unlike progesterone it has the capacity to depress growth elicited by testosterone. The introduction of a flourine atom in the 9 (α) position resulted in a striking increase of the growth-inhibitory activity of 11 β-hydroxyprogesterone and hydrocortisone. 9 α-Flouro- 11 β-hydroxyprogesterone is a partial but significant inhibitor of growth of the uterus in hypophysectomized rats injected simultaneously with large doses of estrone or testosterone. It is more powerful than progesterone in transforming the <b>vaginal</b> epithelium to <b>mucus</b> cells in the presence of estrone. Administered alone, the only detectable growth was a slight increase in size of the preputial glands. 9 α-Flouro- 11 β-hydroxyprogesterone suppresses in part the growth of the adrenals, ovaries, and uterus in intact rats at a dose level which does not cause loss of body weight or inhibit body growth.

40|$|The {{multiple}} ovulation and {{embryo transfer}} (MOET) technique represents {{an attempt to}} further contribute to genetic improvement. Several authors reported a scanty recovery rate in terms of embryos in buffalo species after superovulatory treatment, {{with an average of}} 1. 43, 2. 38 and 1. 4 - 3. 1 embryos/flushing/donor. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify if the presence of progesterone during the first two days of a FSH-LH superovulatory treatment may improve embryo recovery. The trial was carried out on 14 multiparous Italian Mediterranean Buffaloes at 113 ± 98 days in milk from December to May. The animals were synchronized by a double injection of 0. 524 mg of PGF 2 α 12 days apart. After 60 hours from the last injection of PGF 2 α buffaloes undergone clinical examination of the genital tract in order to evaluate estrus status: animals with tonic uterus and a follicle higher than 1. 2 mm, with or without <b>mucus</b> <b>vaginal</b> discharge, were considered in estrus and a progesterone releasing intravaginal device was inserted (Day 0). Buffaloes were, hence, divided in two groups, according to parity and days in milk. In Group A (n= 7) PRID was removed on Day 8, whereas in Group B (n= 7) it was left till day 10. Both groups received a 4 -day decreasing dosage of an equal mixture of 500 I. U. of FSH and LH since day 8. On day 10 all treated buffaloes were injected twice 12 hours apart with 0. 524 mg PGF 2 α. Two artificial inseminations were performed 60 and 84 h after the second injection of PGF 2 α. Six days after the first insemination buffaloes undergone a uterine flushing with phosphate buffered saline supplemented with 1 % fetal calf serum: each uterine horn was washed with at least 500 ml of solution. Embryos were immediately searched by filtration and vitrified, according to Neglia et al. (2001). Statistical analyses was carried out by t Student test. Two animals (one for each treatment) did not result responsive to the superovulation treatment. A higher, although not statistically significant, number of embryos was recorded in Group B vs. Group A if all animals are considered. However, if the analysis is carried out only on responsive buffaloes, a higher (P< 0. 05) recovery rate was recorded in Group B vs. Group A. These results are in accordance with previous reports in buffalo species. Progesterone supplementation during the first two days of the superovulation treatment seems to enhance the number of recovered embryos, although further studied are needed in order to apply the MOET in buffalo...|$|R

In three fistulated buffalo, the diet supplemented with Aspergillus oryzae showed a decrease (P < 0. 01) in protein digestibility in the rumen (79. 3 vs. 45. 9 %). No differences were registered in productive performance. Nine buffaloes not in oestrus during the dietary treatment (Groups T 1 and C 1), 30 days in milk, were used to study the haematological profile and to determine milk urea and ammonia in the <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus.</b> The animals in Group T 1 had higher ammonia values in the blood (P < 0. 01) but not in the <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus</b> than Group C 1. A relationship was found between MU and BU. MU was influenced by CP intake and dry matter intake. No differences between the treatments were observed in reproductive performance and the conception rate and calving interval were 37. 9 % and 41. 4 % (90 trial-day) and 449 and 419 days respectively in Groups T and C. Reproductive performance was not influenced by high levels of BU nor by blood ammonia levels, although the latter were higher in the group fed the diet supplemented with Aspergillus oryzae...|$|E
40|$|Yeasts are {{commensal}} organisms {{found in}} the skin, genital and gastrointestinal tracts, and other mucosa in mammalians. Candida spp has been frequently isolated from domestic and sylvan animals. Yeast isolation from <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus</b> is frequent in women, especially of Candida genus. In canine females, however, studies about vaginal fungal microbiota are rare and the connection with estrous cycle is unknown. The {{purpose of this study}} was to isolate yeast 5 of Candida genus from healthy canine females and identify the isolated species, establishing their connection with estrous cycle phases. Two hundred twenty-four samples taken from <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus</b> of 14 canine females were analyzed in this study. Candida spp was observed in 83 (37 %) from these samples; nine samples were taken in proestrus, 14 in oestrus, 31 in dioestrus, 24 in anoestrus and five samples were obtained during pregnancy. Candida parapsilosis the most frequently isolated specie (21. 7 %), followed by C. guillermondii (8. 4 %), C. kefir (6 %) and C. albicans (4. 8 %). We concluded that Candida spp is a commion component of healthy canine females ’ vaginal microbiota, and isolation varies according to the estrous cycle phase.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate whether intravaginal infusion of a lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cocktail around parturition could influence the immune response, incidence rate of uterine infections, and the overall health status of periparturient dairy cows. One hundred pregnant Holstein dairy cows were assigned to 1 of the 3 experimental groups as follows: 1) one dose of LAB on wk - 2 and - 1, and one dose of carrier (sterile skim milk) on wk + 1 relative to the expected day of parturition (TRT 1); 2) one dose of LAB on wk - 2, - 1, and + 1 (TRT 2), and 3) one dose of carrier on wk - 2, - 1, and + 1 (CTR). The LAB were a lyophilized culture mixture composed of Lactobacillus sakei FUA 3089, Pediococcus acidilactici FUA 3138, and Pediococcus acidilactici FUA 3140 with a cell count of 108 - 109 cfu/dose. Blood samples and <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus</b> were collected once a week from wk - 2 to + 3 and analyzed for content of serum total immunoglobulin G (IgG), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin (Hp), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL) - 1, IL- 6, and <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus</b> secretory IgA (sIgA). Clinical observations including rectal temperature, vaginal discharges, retained placenta, displaced abomasum, and laminitis were monitored from wk - 2 to + 8 relative to calving. Results showed that intravaginal LAB lowered the incidence of metritis and total uterine infections. Intravaginal LAB also were associated with lower concentrations of systemic LBP, an overall tendency for lower SAA, and greater <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus</b> sIgA. No differences were observed for serum concentrations of Hp, TNF, IL- 1, IL- 6 and total IgG among the treatment groups. Administration with LAB had no effect on the incidence rates of other transition cow diseases. Overall intravaginal LAB lowered uterine infections and improved local and systemic immune responses in the treated transition dairy cows...|$|E
