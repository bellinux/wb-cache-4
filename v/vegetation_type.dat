5|$|Devised by the American {{climatologist}} and geographer C. W. Thornthwaite, {{this climate}} classification method monitors the soil water budget using evapotranspiration. It monitors {{the portion of}} total precipitation used to nourish vegetation over a certain area. It uses indices such as a humidity index and an aridity index to determine an area's moisture regime based upon its average temperature, average rainfall, and average <b>vegetation</b> <b>type.</b> The lower {{the value of the}} index in any given area, the drier the area is.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters {{are fairly}} {{indiscriminate}} in {{their choice of}} habitat. Their requirements are simply an elevated perch from which to watch for prey and a suitable ground substrate in which to dig their breeding burrow. Because their prey is entirely caught on the wing they are not dependent on any <b>vegetation</b> <b>type.</b> A single species, the blue-headed bee-eater, is found inside closed rainforest where it forages {{close to the ground}} in poor light in the gaps between large trees. Six other species are also closely associated with rainforest, but occur in edge habitat such as along rivers, in tree-fall gaps, off trees overhanging ravines or on emergent tree crowns above the main canopy.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} find {{suitable}} <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> for wider earthquake-triggered landslide rehabilitation in the eastern Longmenshan, we chose six <b>vegetation</b> <b>types,</b> which included three artificial restoration <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> (shrub Paeonia decomposita, deciduous tree Betula albo-sinensis, and evergreen tree Cryptomeria fortunei), two natural restoration <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> (middle and high coverage of grasses), and one residual vegetation. Soil quality, runoff, and soil loss were evaluated for the six <b>vegetation</b> <b>types.</b> We found that high coverage of grass prevented surface runoff and soil erosion more effectively than other <b>vegetation</b> <b>types,</b> and the deciduous tree and shrub were more suitable for soil quality recovery than the evergreen tree after the landslide. Among the three artificially planted <b>vegetation</b> <b>types,</b> {{the roots of the}} deciduous tree had stronger expansion ability than those of the shrub and evergreen tree. Our results indicated that high coverage of grass and deciduous trees could complement each other to achieve a good restoring effect, which would not only help reduce surface runoff and soil erosion but also facilitate the formation of fertile islands and enhance the stability of subsurface soils. Therefore, the two <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> could be used to form an effective vegetation restoration pattern for wider earthquake-triggered landslide rehabilitation in this region...|$|R

40|$|Endangered <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> {{have been}} mapped in the {{municipalities}} of Inderøy and Levanger in order to evaluate how well the <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> are covered by the municipal mapping of valuable nature types. In Inderøy the mapping is compared with the existing survey of valuable nature types, and in Levanger registrations are made to increase our experience in mapping of endangered <b>vegetation</b> <b>types.</b> The project shows that endangered <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> are fairly well covered by the mapping of nature types, where this is carried out by experienced vegetation ecologists. Vegetation mapping based on field surveys is neces-sary {{for most of the}} nature or <b>vegetation</b> <b>types.</b> It gives a better survey of the species content, which can lead to more localities with valuable nature types being recorded, and it is also an important contribution to the valuation of the localities. Studies using aerial photos or satellite images are well suited for recor-ding of particular mire types, although field surveys are necessary in order to map nutrient gradients, flora and vegetation. It is recommended that this project is followed by mapping of endangered <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> in a number of municipalities selected at random, which has already carried out mapping of nature types. Furthermore, that emphasis is put on increasing the knowledge about variation and distribution of <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> within the various nature types...|$|R

Elevations in this part of the forest are substantially lower (Sedona is at 4,500 feet (1,400m) above sea level) than the rest of the forest resulting in higher temperatures year round.|$|E

40|$|The {{great variety}} of <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> found in the Bankenveld was {{assessed}} by randomly selecting 220 relevés, representing the major <b>vegetation</b> <b>types,</b> from 23 phytosociological studies from data stored in the TURBOVEG database at the University of Pretoria. These relevés were classified by using TWINSPAN and then refining the result in MEGATAB. The phytosociological table was reduced to 120 relevés which represent 16 major <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> found in the Bankenveld. An assessment was made to relate the <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> to various phytochoria and it is concluded that the Bankenveld has definite floristic affinities to the grassland of the interior plateaux of South Africa, the savannas of the Sour Bushveld and Sourish Mixed Bushveld, the Drakensberg Afromontane vegetation and the Kalahari vegetation...|$|R
40|$|We censused {{butterfly}} assemblages of the Western Chats of India in 15 localities and 8 <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> during 67 transects, each 600 m long, and traversed in one hour. The natural <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> had {{relatively high}} diversities compared to human impacted <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> such as scrub/savanna and grasslands. The home gardens and paddy fields had very distinctive species composition, coupled with very {{low levels of}} beta diversity. Their constituent species were more widespread. Comparison of these patterns with those found amongst trees and birds reported in similar studies threw up interesting parallels as well as contrasts. Species dissimilarity in evergreen <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> was high for trees and butterflies, but low for birds. Bird and butterfly assemblages in monoculture tree plantations had low species richness, less distinctiveness {{and high levels of}} dissimilarity, being comprised of rather widespread species. However, on the whole there was little relation between taxonomic groups and <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> across diversity parameters, There could be important implications of these patterns of diversity dispersion and their co-variation across taxonomic groups for assigning conservation priorities. We emphasize the need for classifying the landscape, both natural and manmade, on the basis of structural <b>vegetation</b> <b>types,</b> followed by stratified sampling of multiple groups of organisms for monitoring the status of and designing conservation strategy for biodiversity...|$|R

Due to their high ecological value, monitoring of arid regions is necessary and modern vegetation studies can help in the conservation and management of these areas. The use of remote sensing for mapping desert vegetation is difficult due to mixing the spectral reflectance of bright desert soils with the weak spectral response of sparse vegetation.

40|$|A floristic {{analysis}} of the grass species assemblages of the Licuati Forest and Maputo Elephant Reserves south of Maputo Bay, Mozambique, is presented. Sampling of grass data was undertaken in six previously described, major <b>vegetation</b> <b>types.</b> TWINSPAN divisions distinguished grass assemblages that are characteristic for these major <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> of the study area. The results were supported by an Indirect Gradient Analysis. Further TWINSPAN divisions of a larger Maputaland data set indicated a floristic relationship between grass assemblages of similar major <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> {{in the study area}} and South Africa. This relationship was supported by high similarity values (> 65 %), obtained with Sorenson's Coefficient. The coefficient also indicated varying degrees of similarity between grass assemblages of different major <b>vegetation</b> <b>types</b> within the study area. A rich diversity of 115 grass species and infraspecific taxa was recorded for the study area.
