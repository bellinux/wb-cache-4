40|$|This article {{contends that}} many of the {{fundamental}} concepts of law (such as justice, incentives, and deterrence) are not directly measurable, and have, therefore, been largely ignored by empirical legal scholarship. Fortunately, other social sciences have confronted this same obstacle and have developed methods with which to empirically assess these intangible concepts. I propose that the concept of construct validation, which has been developed in the psychology subfield of psychometrics, can be adapted to law to measure these unobservable traits. To adapt construct <b>validation</b> to <b>law,</b> empirical legal scholars must 1) develop generalized theories, 2) infer multiple hypotheses from these theories, 3) use appropriate research designs to test the hypotheses, and 4) the modify existing theories to reflect the empirical results of the studies.

40|$|International audienceThis paper reviews {{a set of}} {{robustness}} {{analysis tools}} developed by the authors {{during the last decade}} to evaluate the robustness properties of high-dimensional closed-loop plants subject to numerous time-invariant uncertainties. These tools are used to compute both upper and lower bounds on the robust stability margin, the worst-case H∞ performance level, as well as the traditional gain, phase, modulus and time-delay margins. The key idea is to solve the problem on just a coarse frequency grid and to perform a fast validation on the whole frequency range, which results in guaranteed but conservative bounds on the aforementioned quantities. Some heuristics are then applied to determine a set of worst-case parametric configurations leading to over-optimistic bounds. A branch and bound scheme is finally implemented, so as to tighten these bounds with the desired accuracy, while still guaranteeing a reasonable computational complexity.

40|$|Abstract. Several noted surveys on intra-industry {{dynamics}} {{have reached}} the conclusion from {{a large body of}} evidence that Gibrat’s Law does not hold. However, almost all of these studies have been based on manufacturing or large scale services such as banking and insurance industries. There are compelling reasons to doubt whether these findings hold for small scale services such as the hospitality industries. In this paper we examine whether the basic tenet underlying Gibrat’s Law – that growth rates are independent of firm size – can be rejected for the services as it has been for manufacturing. Based on a large sample of Dutch firms in the hospitality industries the evidence suggests that in most cases growth rates are independent of firm size. <b>Validation</b> of Gibrat’s <b>Law</b> in some sub-sectors of the small scale services suggests that the dynamics of industrial organization for services may not simply mirror that for manufacturing.

In addition to the effective suppression of short channel effects due to the improved gate strength, the multi-gate NWFETs show excellent current drive and have the merit that they are compatible with conventional CMOS processes. To simulate these devices, accurate modeling and calculations based on quantum mechanics are necessary to assess their performance limits, since cross-sections of the multigate NWFETs are expected to be a few nanometers wide in their ultimate scaling.

40|$|Evaluation of {{uncertainties}} of the temperature measurement by standard {{platinum resistance thermometer}} calibrated at the defining fixed points according to ITS- 90 {{is a problem that}} can be solved in different ways.

This allows taking into account the correlations among resistances at the defining fixed points.

Their validation was accomplished by comparing the numerical maximum load (Pm) predictions with the experimental results. An analysis of peel (σ) and shear (τ) stresses in the adhesive layer was also performed to understand the influence of stresses on Pm. The use of the direct method allowed obtaining very precise Pm predictions. For the geometric and material conditions considered, this study has led to the conclusion that no significant Pm errors are incurred by the choice of a less appropriate law or by uncoupling the loading modes.|$|R

40|$|The {{determination}} of the fatigue life of a mechanical component subjected to cyclic multi-axial loading is a critical and often time-consuming step in the design cycle of a product. It is generally accepted that conventional analytical tools and traditional safety factors are not sufficient for reliable fatigue life predictions of safety-critical components. Simulations with numerical models offer a solution, but the accuracy of these methods is limited. Therefore, physical experiments on full-scale prototypes are still necessary to validate analytical and numerical fatigue life estimates of safety-critical components. However, conventional fatigue life experiments require considerable time and resources and are therefore often limited, with larger uncertainty in the fatigue life predictions as a result. In this thesis, a methodology for accurate and accelerated fatigue experiments with limited complexity is proposed based on scaling laws for fatigue behaviour. The proposed method focuses on the {{determination of}} the fatigue life of large components by using experimental data from time- and cost-efficient tests on small scale models. Size-effects in mechanical fatigue are studied using numerical calculations of highly stressed material zones and fatigue data of notched specimens. This approach is validated on aluminium specimens loaded in cyclic bending and titanium specimens loaded in cyclic tension. In addition, the applicability of additive manufacturing techniques to analyse size-effects in fatigue is studied and a novel multi-axial fatigue test rig is developed for <b>validation</b> of scaling <b>laws</b> under real-life loading conditions. nrpages: 276 status: publishe...|$|R

However, the {{limited amount of}} high-Re experimental data has hampered the development and <b>validation</b> of scaling <b>laws</b> and modelling techni-ques applicable to such flows. This paper presents measurements of the turbulent flow near {{the trailing edge of}} a two-dimensional lifting surface at chord-based Reynolds numbers, ReC, typical of heavy-lift aircraft wings and full-scale ship propellers. The experiments were conducted in the William B. Morgan Large Cavitation Channel at flow speeds from 0. 50 to 18. 3 m s− 1 with a cambered hydrofoil having a 3. 05 m span and a 2. 13 m chord that generated 60 metric tons of lift at the highest flow speed, ReC ≈ 50 × 106. Flow-field measurements concentrated on the foil’s near wake and include results from trailing edges having terminating bevel angles of 44 ◦ and 56 ◦. Although generic turbulent boundary layer and wake characteristics were found at any fixed ReC in the trailing-edge region, the variable strength of near-wake vortex shedding caused the flow-field fluctuations to be Reynolds-number and trailing-edge-geometry dependent. In the current experiments, vortex-shedding strength peaked at ReC = 4 × 106 with the 56 ◦ bevel-angle trailing edge. A dimensionless scaling for this phenomenon constructed from the free-stream speed, the wake thickness, and an average suction-side shear-layer vorticity at the trailing edge collapses the vortex-shedding strength measurements for 1. 4 × 106 ReC 50 × 106 from both trailing edges and from prior measurements on two-dimensional struts at ReC ∼ 2 × 106 with asymmetrical trailing edges. 1...|$|R
