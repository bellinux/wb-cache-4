New land units include the Bike, a highly mobile {{infantry}} unit that can capture properties; the Flare, an armored <b>vehicle</b> <b>unit</b> that can reveal areas affected by the Fog of War; the Anti-Tank, an indirect-fire unit strong against tanks with the ability to counter-attack during direct attacks; and the War Tank (formerly the Mega Tank), the strongest ground unit in the game. New air units include the Duster, a weaker, lower-cost interceptor that can strike ground units; and the Seaplane, which is produced by Carriers and can attack any unit, but has limited ammo and fuel reserves. Additionally, there is a single new sea unit, the Gunboat, which is armed with a missile salvo that must be resupplied after each use, and can transport one infantry/mech unit. Also, the Battleship was given the ability to move and fire in the same turn, making it the only indirect-combat unit able to do so.|$|E

25|$|In early April as the Allied {{forces and}} notably the French Army {{advanced}} toward Pforzheim, the local German military commander gave orders {{to destroy the}} electric power generating plant and those gas and water supply lines that were still working, but citizens succeeded in persuading the staff sergeant {{in charge of the}} operation to refrain from this absurd endeavor {{in the face of the}} imminent and inevitable surrender of the German military. Likewise, orders were issued for the destruction of those bridges that had remained unscathed (some of the bridges had been destroyed by air strikes even before and after 23 February), and this could not be prevented. Only the Iron (Railway) Bridge in Weißenstein ward was saved by stout-hearted citizens who, during an unguarded moment, pulled off the fuze wiring from the explosive devices, which had already been installed, and dropped it into Nagold river. Soon after that on 8 April, French troops (an armored <b>vehicle</b> <b>unit)</b> moved into Pforzheim from the northwest and were able to occupy the area north of Enz river, but the area south of the Enz river was defended by a German infantry unit using artillery. Fighting was especially fierce in Broetzingen. The French army units (including an Algerian and Moroccan unit) suffered heavy losses; among the dead was the commander of the army unit, Capitaine Dorance. The advance of the French army came to a halt temporarily, but with the support of fighterbomber aircraft and due to the bad condition of the defenders (which included many old men and young boys who had been drafted into the Volkssturm) the French troops finally succeeded and on 18 April took possession of the vast rubble field which once was the proud residential town of the Baden Margraves.|$|E

40|$|This {{final report}} which was {{prepared}} {{within the framework}} of the MODULAR R and D project presents the results of detailed preliminary studies of the traffic and transport serviceability, the technical feasibility, and the economic benefits of modular <b>vehicle</b> <b>units,</b> which consists of a basic midibus and an additonal coupling module, for public transport companies in the region under review. The partial results are summarized: modular <b>vehicle</b> <b>units</b> can replace articulated buses which are little profitable in rural areas. They can also replace standard buses which cannot be used economically. Modular <b>vehicles</b> as <b>units</b> with two-axle or center-axle modules can be provided with conventional gangways or low platforms. Existing maintenance and repair strategies can be applied because modular <b>vehicle</b> <b>units</b> are largely based on standardized vehicle components. Cost savings are in the range of 6 to 15 % depending on the individual conditions. Modular <b>vehicle</b> <b>units</b> contribute to the stabilization and improvement of the threatened rural public transport services. (orig.)

50|$|They {{were taken}} over in 1961 by AEC parent Associated Commercial Vehicles Ltd, and {{production}} {{was limited to}} Nubians, Big Bens and Antars, although the Thornycroft-designed six-speed constant mesh gearbox was used in AEC and later medium weight Leyland and Albion trucks. ACV was then taken over by Leyland in 1962. They already had a specialist <b>vehicle</b> <b>unit</b> in Scammell, another manufacturer of large haulage vehicles. Thornycroft's Basingstoke factory was closed in 1969 and specialist vehicles transferred to Scammell at Watford.|$|E
50|$|The rules permit {{units to}} both fire and move {{during the same}} action (Fire and Movement). However, if an {{infantry}} or <b>vehicle</b> <b>unit</b> focuses only on firing at a target, Tide of Iron considers it laying down concentrated fire. This is the standard way units fire in the game. How effective or deadly a unit is when concentrating fire on a target depends on several key factors. Staying with the basics, {{it depends on what}} type of unit is firing (firepower), what type of target is selected, and the target's range.|$|E

5000|$|In 1998, the {{vehicles}} and {{colors of the}} patrol car fleet changed. The new fleet consisted of the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor, Mitsubishi Montero, Chevrolet Camaro, Ford Mustang, Honda Police CB500P, Harley Davidson Electra Glide, Ford Excursion and Ford Expedition (these last two only for SWAT). The new color scheme was a white base all over the car, with two color lines, blue and yellow crossed, running along the side (see image below). From {{the rear of the}} car to its midpoint, the blue line ran above the yellow line. At the midpoint, the blue line crossed behind the yellow line, placing the blue line below the yellow line from there to the front tire. The logo was on the front doors. [...] "Emergencia 9-1-1" [...] (Emergency 9-1-1) was marked on each side {{at the rear of the}} car. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>unit</b> numbers were placed near the front door, just over the edge of the front tires on both sides; also on the roof, behind the light bar.|$|E
50|$|Siam Di Tella {{focused on}} its {{appliance}} and machinery units, though losses stemming from its defunct <b>vehicle</b> <b>unit</b> led to growing debts {{with the state}} small business lender, BANADE. Paying the lender with company stock in lieu of cash, Siam gradually made the Argentine government its partner. The latter absorbed Siam in 1972, after which the firm expanded into foreign markets through exports of its refrigerators, and into the transformer industry. The March 1976 coup and the free trade and deregulatory policies enacted by the last dictatorship's Economy Minister, José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz, affected the company adversely, however. Unable to compete with a flood of imported appliances in the late 1970s and beset by a national financial collapse in the early 1980s, Siam di Tella declared bankruptcy in 1981 and its facilities were sold by the National Government in 1986. The steel tube facility was sold to Techint, and their remaining appliance units to the Pérez Companc conglomerate and local appliance and electronics maker Aurora; another small appliance and parts facility in Monte Chingolo was acquired by Newsan in {{a joint venture with}} Sanyo in 1991. A renewed boom in imports ultimately led to the bankruptcy of Aurora in 1997.|$|E
