50|$|T-VIS is {{intended}} to improve the low-end torque of high-performance, four-stroke internal combustion engines - by changing the geometry of the intake manifold according to the engine rotation speed. The system uses two separate intake runners per cylinder, one being equipped with a butterfly valve that can either open or close the runner. All valves are attached to a common shaft which is rotated by a <b>vacuum</b> <b>actuator</b> outside the manifold. T-VIS does not actually keep one of the intake valves from opening or seal off the port for one valve.|$|E
5000|$|The SOHC eight-valve 4G54 (also {{known as}} the G54B) {{displaces}} 2555 cc L, with bore &times; stroke at 91.1 mm &times; 98.0 mm. The G54B for the US market had a cylinder head with additional jet valves to improve emissions (MCA-Jet system). The engine was fitted to various Mitsubishi models from 1978 to 1997 and to the American Chrysler K-cars and their derivatives between 1981 and 1987. It was primarily set up longitudinally for use in rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive platforms {{but also as a}} transverse engine in the front-wheel drive platform of the Mitsubishi Magna and Chrysler K platform. Chrysler commonly marketed the engine [...] "Hemi", whereas the Australian-made version was marketed as the [...] "Astron II" [...] and featured [...] "Balance Shaft" [...] technology, which was subsequently licensed to Porsche and other automakers. The original engine featured a Milkuni two-barrel carburetor with a secondary <b>vacuum</b> <b>actuator.</b> Later versions adopted EFI and Japan's first production EFI and turbo engine as fitted to the Mitsubishi Starion. Chrysler commonly paired this engine with its A470 3-speed automatic transmission; in Australia, Mitsubishi adapted it to a 5-speed manual transmission and its [...] "ELC" [...] (Electronic Control) 4-speed automatic transmission, featuring electronic overdrive. Chrysler eventually replaced the 4G54 with its own 2.5 L engine, whereas Mitsubishi replaced it with a 2.4 L engine codenamed 4G64.|$|E

40|$|Actuation {{systems for}} {{automotive}} boost control incorporate a vacuum tank and PWM controlled vacuum valves {{to increase the}} boosting system flexibility. Physical models for the actuator system are constructed using measurement data from a dynamometer with an engine having a two stage turbo system. The actuator model is integrated in a complete Mean Value Engine Model and a boost pressure controller is constructed. The developed model is used as basis for a nonlinear compensator, {{that is capable of}} rejecting disturbances from system voltage. An IMC based boost pressure controller is developed for the <b>vacuum</b> <b>actuator</b> and engine by using the engine model and then tested on the test cell.

50|$|The {{engine control}} unit (ECU) {{controls}} the position {{of one or more}} air control valves based on input signals from throttle angle and engine RPM. The vacuum switching valve (VSV) which controls the vacuum supply to the actuator is normally closed and passes <b>vacuum</b> to the <b>actuator</b> when it is energized by the ECU. By energizing the VSV vacuum is passed to the actuator, closing the air control valve. This effectively lengthens the intake manifold run. By de-energizing the VSV, <b>vacuum</b> to the <b>actuator</b> is blocked and trapped vacuum is bled off of the actuator diaphragm. Toyota ACIS is an On/Off system. The valve (or valves in newer models with multiple valves to create more than 2 lengths) is either fully opened or fully closed.An example of early single-valve ACIS programming would be the 3.0L 3VZ-FE engine. The ECU actuates the VSV to close the valve when the throttle position is 60% or greater and engine speed is 3,900 RPM or more.|$|R

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards in the USA by the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, it was common to use manifold vacuum to drive windscreen wipers with a pneumatic motor. This system was cheap & simple but resulted in the comical yet unsafe effect of wipers which operate at full speed while the engine idles, operate around half speed while cruising, and stop altogether when the driver depresses the pedal fully. Vehicle HVAC systems also used manifold <b>vacuum</b> to drive <b>actuators</b> controlling airflow and temperature.|$|R
50|$|Systems to {{increase}} efficiency and safety and comfort systems dominate the electronic product portfolio. These include Data-enabled electronic control units and roof modules as complex light-electronic modules, as well as Vehicle access and driving authorization. Modules for power management to optimise the energy balance of the electrical system and improve the battery charge balance. Innovation and growth area are electronic driver assistance systems.

Another important business segment are electronic components such as position sensors, <b>actuators,</b> <b>vacuum</b> pumps and wash water systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine control}} unit (ECU) allows <b>vacuum</b> into the <b>actuator</b> by {{powering}} a solenoid valve when the engine rotation speed is low. At higher engine speeds (e.g. 4,200 rpm), vacuum is cut off and a spring inside the actuator causes the butterfly valve to fully open. The idea behind the system {{is that in the}} lower engine speed band, the speed of the intake air will be increased because the intake runner cross section per cylinder is smaller. However, when engine speed increases, the second runner is opened, decreasing airflow speed, but increasing the airflow volume, better matching the engine's airflow needs at higher revolutions. With modified engines it may be desirable to have the T-VIS open earlier than stock, because modifications that improve an engine's power output may do so by increasing airflow per engine revolution, resulting in a high airflow at a lower rpm.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of contactless electromagnetically levitated positioning systems is {{stimulated by the}} demand for vacuum compatible production machines. These vacuum compatible machines are used e. g. in the {{development of}} faster semiconductor chips and optical discs with larger data capacity. A novel <b>vacuum</b> compatible <b>actuator</b> is the IU-module. The IU-module allows wireless actuation in multiple degrees of freedom. The suspension force of this actuator is generated by permanent magnets allowing the force to be created with low power dissipation. In vacuum environments, low power dissipation is often a requirement {{due to the lack of}} convective cooling. In this research, the potential of this novel Multi-DoF actuator is studied by integrating it into nanometre resolution contactless linear position positioning system, the Slider. This Slider has to fulfill the specifications of a linear positioning system used in a modern optical disc mastering production machine. In its most critical direction, the developed Slider using the IU-modules realized a position stability of 0. 12 nm (standard deviation) with a control strategy acting on the rigid body coordinates. When additional actuation capabilities of the IU-module were used, the excitation of flexible modes in the Slider could be reduced. This allowed the positioning performance of the Slider to be improved to 58 pm (standard deviation). The challenges addressed in the research are the electromagnetic design of the actuator itself, as well as the integral mechatronic design and control of the linear positioning system.

40|$|The torque {{response}} of the engine {{is important for the}} driving experience of a vehicle. In spark ignited engines, torque is proportional to the air flow into the cylinders. Controlling torque therefore implies controlling air flow. In modern turbocharged engines, the driver commands are interpreted by an electronic control unit that controls the engine through electromechanical and pneumatic actuators. Air flow to the intake manifold is controlled by an electronic throttle, and a wastegate controls the energy to the turbine, affecting boost pressure and air flow. These actuators and their dynamics affect the torque response and a lot of time is put into calibration of controllers for these actuators. By modeling and understanding the actuator behavior this dynamics can be compensated for, leaving a reduced control problem, which can shorten the calibration time. Electronic throttle servo control is the first problem studied. By constructing a control oriented model for the throttle servo and inverting that model, the resulting controller becomes two static compensators for friction and limp-home nonlinearities, together with a PD-controller. A gain-scheduled I-part is added for robustness to handle model errors. The sensitivity to model errors is studied and a method for tuning the controller is presented. The performance has been evaluated in simulation, in test vehicle, and in a throttle control benchmark. A model for a pneumatic wastegate actuator and solenoid control valve, used for boost pressure control, is presented. The actuator dynamics is shown to be important for the transient boost pressure response. The model is incorporated in a mean value engine model and shown to give accurate description of the transient response. A tuning method for the  feedback (PID) part of a boost controller is proposed, based on step responses in wastegate control signal. Together with static feedforward the controller is shown to achieve the desired boost pressure response. Submodels for an advanced boost control system consisting of several <b>vacuum</b> <b>actuators,</b> solenoid valves, a vacuum tank and a vacuum pump are developed. The submodels and integrated system are evaluated on a two stage series sequential turbo system, and control with system voltage disturbance rejection is demonstrated on an engine in a test cell. Turbocharged V-type engines often have two parallel turbochargers, each powered by one bank of cylinders. When the two air paths are connected before the throttle an unwanted oscillation can occur. When the compressors operate close to the surge line and a disturbance alters the mass flow balance, the compressors can begin to alternately go into surge, this is called co-surge. Measurements on co-surge in parallel turbocharged engines are presented and analyzed. A mean value engine model, augmented with a Moore-Greitzer compressor model to handle surge, is shown to capture the cosurge behavior. A sensitivity analysis shows which model parameters have the largest influence of the phenomena. The compressor operation in the map during co-surge is studied, and the alternating compressor speeds are shown to {{have a major impact on}} the continuing oscillation. Based on the analysis, detection methods and a controller are proposed, these detect co-surge and control the turbo speeds to match during co-surge. The controller is evaluated both in simulation and on a test vehicle in a vehicle dynamometer, showing that co-surge can be detected and the oscillations quelled...|$|R
40|$|A {{compact and}} {{lightweight}} mechanism has been developed to accurately move a Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) scan mirror (a cube corner) in a near-linear fashion with near constant speed at cryogenic temperatures. This innovation includes a slide mechanism to restrict motion to one dimension, an actuator to drive the motion, and a linear velocity transducer (LVT) to measure the speed. The cube corner mirror is double-passed in one arm of the FTS; double-passing is required to compensate for optical beam shear resulting from tilting of the moving cube corner. The slide, actuator, and LVT are off-the-shelf components {{that are capable of}} cryogenic <b>vacuum</b> operation. The <b>actuator</b> drives the slide for the required travel of 2. 5 cm. The LVT measures translation speed. A proportional feedback loop compares the LVT voltage with the set voltage (speed) to derive an error signal to drive the actuator and achieve near constant speed. When the end of the scan is reached, a personal computer reverses the set voltage. The actuator and LVT have no moving parts in contact, and have magnetic properties consistent with cryogenic operation. The unlubricated slide restricts motion to linear travel, using crossed roller bearings consistent with 100 -million- stroke operation. The mechanism tilts several arc seconds during transport of the FTS mirror, which would compromise optical fringe efficiency when using a flat mirror. Consequently, a cube corner mirror is used, which converts a tilt into a shear. The sheared beam strikes (at normal incidence) a flat mirror {{at the end of the}} FTS arm with the moving mechanism, thereby returning upon itself and compensating for the shea...|$|R
40|$|A {{conceptual}} design {{has been developed}} for a moderate size (R = 6. 0 m) high field (B = 13. 1 T at the coil) tokamak demonstration power reactor which can produce fusion power densities as high as 310 MW/m with a spatially averaged value of toroidal beta of less than 5 %. The High Field Compact Tokamak Reactor (HFCTR) design is based upon minimal extrapolation from experimentally established plasma confinement and MD stability in tokamak devices. The product of average current density and maximum field in the toroidal field coils is shown. to be a fundamental figure of merit for tokamaks. A unique design of the Nb 3 Sn toroidal-field magnet system allows the achievement of high fields with a small radial build. An integrated system of automated <b>actuators,</b> <b>vacuum</b> and current-carrying mechanical joints and. flexible cryostats allow total modularization of the reactor, including the poloidal and toroidal field coil systems. A detailed estimate of maintenance opera-tion time indicated the possibility of performing all mechanical opera-tions in a 450 sector replacement in two days. The modest value of toroidal beta permits a simple plasma-shaping coil system, with only two coil pairs inside the TF coil bore. The plasma is initiated by rapidly dropping a pre-existing bias field in the interior coils. Heating of the central plasma is attained {{by the use of}} vertically asymmetric coils for ripple-assisted injection of 120 keV D 0 beams, which are also used for dynamic control of the plasma temperature during the burn period.
