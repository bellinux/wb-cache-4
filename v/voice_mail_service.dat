40|$|Abstract—Traditional {{answering}} {{machines and}} <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>services</b> are closed systems, tightly coupled {{to a single}} end system, the local PBX or local exchange carrier. Even simple services, such as forwarding <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> to another user outside the local system, are hard to provide. With the advent of Internet telephony, we need to provide <b>voice</b> and video <b>mail</b> <b>services.</b> This also offers the opportunity {{to address some of}} the shortcomings of existing <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> systems. We list general requirements for a multimedia mail system for Internet telephony. We then propose an architecture using SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) and compare various alternative approaches to solving call forwarding, reclaiming and retrieval of messages. We also briefly describe our prototype implementation...|$|R

50|$|Unified {{communications}} {{is sometimes}} confused with unified messaging, {{but it is}} distinct. Unified communications refers to both real-time and non-real-time delivery of communications based on the preferred method and location of the recipient; unified messaging culls messages from several sources (such as e-mail, <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> and faxes), but holds those messages only for retrieval at a later time. Unified communications allows for an individual to check and retrieve an e-mail or <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> from any communication device at any time. It expands beyond <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>services</b> to data communications and video services.|$|R

50|$|If the {{called person}} has opted to use ENUM she/he will have {{published}} the ENUM number and have entered (via ENUM NAPTR) his/her wishes {{for how the}} call should be terminated. This might be a single VoIP identifier, but most likely {{it will be a}} list of how the call should be forwarded to various fixed-line, cellphones, secretarial or <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>services,</b> either at the IP or at the PSTN side of the network. It is the called party choice to opt-in ENUM and also to decide to let the calling party know her/his wishes.|$|R
40|$|Data {{protection}} and data security become more significant since telecommunication services and innovative applications {{based on these}} services handle an increasing amount of sensitive data. Modern services, e. g. call forwarding, tele-conferencing, and <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>services</b> use or store personal data to implement individual services. Sensitive data include personal identities or calling numbers, location information of the communicating parties, service indicators, number translation tables, reachability information, and time and duration of communication events. Generally usable open security services interfaces are proposed, that promote security services implemented in user terminals or Trusted Third Parties {{in order to satisfy}} currently ignored and evolving security requirements in a more flexible and scalable way. This approach will both save the huge investments in today’s telecommunication infrastructure and promote open security services that are independent of the underlying network infrastructure. ...|$|R

5000|$|One such {{particular}} {{incident was}} in Egypt, {{where the government}} of Hosni Mubarak shut down the Internet {{a number of times}} during the 2011 uprising in an attempt to suppress the protests, which happened during the Arab Spring. Even though services were only cut off for a few days, this stifled Egyptians' ability to access basic services - such as ambulances - which has been blamed by some for escalating the death toll of protesters. [...] In response to this, Google and Twitter developed a <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>service</b> for Egyptians to leave messages which in turn were posted onto Twitter.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, when VMX was on {{the verge}} of bankruptcy, it was {{acquired}} by Opcom, a designer and seller of computer software products for handling telephone calls. Opcom was acquired in 1994 by Octel Communications, the largest provider of <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> equipment and <b>services</b> in the world. In 1997, Octel was acquired by Lucent Technologies and spun off several years later as part of Avaya.|$|R
50|$|The {{proliferation}} of multiple communications technologies has itself created {{the need to}} combine them effectively, resulting in a new technology, unified communications. This technique blends instant messaging, e-mail, <b>voice</b> <b>mail,</b> short message <b>service,</b> web-conferencing, fax, audio, video, cellphone, VIOP and other telecommunications services into a single system. Cooke Aquaculture Inc. of Blacks Harbour New Brunswick uses just such a system, developed by Cisco Systems Canada Co. to manage its fish farm operations.|$|R
50|$|Another {{advantage}} {{is the opportunity}} for integration and convergence. This opportunity is amplified when using IMS-based solutions. Converged services implies interaction of existing services in a seamless manner to create new value added services. One example is on-screen Caller ID, getting Caller ID on a TV {{and the ability to}} handle it (send it to <b>voice</b> <b>mail,</b> etc.). IP-based <b>services</b> will help to enable efforts to provide consumers anytime-anywhere access to content over their televisions, PCs and cell phones, and to integrate services and content to tie them together. Within businesses and institutions, IPTV eliminates the need to run a parallel infrastructure to deliver live and stored video services.|$|R
50|$|The chapel for the {{university}} is located in St. Mary's Hall, the Jesuit residential facility. The college also maintains close relations with the nearby Church of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. The church is named after {{the founder of the}} Jesuit order, Saint Ignatius of Loyola. It is run independently of the Archdiocese and is staffed by the Jesuits. Although not technically {{the university}}'s church, Boston College provides the parish with Internet access, e-mail service, telephone and <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> <b>service,</b> parking, and dormitory space for the religious education program. Each year, several Boston College students teach in the religious education program. Jesuits priests from Boston College occasionally preside at the church's liturgies. St. Ignatius provides a spiritual home for many students during their time at Boston College and has also hosted alumni weddings. The church building is also used by the college for some of their larger religious events.|$|E
5000|$|Many of the show's {{periodically}} recurring segments {{are based}} on listener participation, and involve the hosts taking calls on a discussion topic or for a guest, or involve games and contests created around promotional giveaways.

Other segments focus on the hosts and their personalities and quirks, like [...] "Thanks for That Info, Bean", which pokes fun at Baxter's intense interest in seemingly trivial topics, and [...] "A Moment with...", where a humorous audio clip of a statement made on-air by a host is replayed. [...] "Would You Like to Take That Back?" [...] is another feature during which the hosts give each other the option of [...] "taking back" [...] an unsuccessful or poorly delivered joke or pun.|$|E

50|$|In 2010, Robinson was {{the chief}} {{technology}} officer at FlyFi, an online music service owned by Maine-based Emergent Discovery which uses his anti-spam programming techniques along with collaborative filtering technologies to help make music recommendations to web users. His blog Gary Robinson's Rants has been quoted by others in the computer and online music industries and cited by academic papers. Robinson helped develop recommendation engine technology which applies high-power mathematical techniques using software algorithms to have a computer guess intelligently about what a consumer might like. For example, if a consumer likes music by artists such as the Beach Boys, Bob Dylan and the Talking Heads, the computer software will match these preferences with a much larger dataset of other consumers who also like those three artists but which cumulatively has much greater musical knowledge than the single consumer. Accordingly, the computer will find music that the user might like but hasn't been exposed to, and therefore hopefully offer intelligent recommendations, in a process which {{has come to be}} called knowledge management. But the mathematics behind such comparisons can become quite complex and involved. Robinson studied mathematics at Bard College and graduated in 1979 and studied further at the Courant Institute of New York University. In the 1980s, Robinson worked on an entrepreneurial start-up dating service called 212-Romance which used similar computer algorithms to match singles romantically. The New York City-based <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> dating <b>service</b> created community-based automated recommendations and used collaborative filtering technologies which Robinson developed further in other capacities.|$|R

40|$|<b>Voice</b> <b>mail</b> {{has become}} a major {{communications}} tool. This study examined the opinions of 357 Indiana chief executive officers regarding <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> systems [...] based on a random sample of the 4, 697 members of the Indiana Chamber of Commerce as of November 18, 1992. A 100 percent response rate was achieved. The CEOs generally did not like calling into systems. The study concluded that 20 percent of Indiana businesses have <b>voice</b> <b>mail.</b> The major advantage [...] as cited by CEOs [...] to calling into systems was that they can leave detailed messages at anytime. The major disadvantage was that <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> is cold and impersonal [...] CEOs want to speak to a real person.

40|$|The <b>Voice</b> <b>Mail</b> <b>Service</b> (VMS) enables {{forwarding}} {{of calls}} to a dedicated Voice Mail Server (VMS) {{on behalf of}} the call receiving subscriber during certain conditions such as 'busy subscriber', 'no answer', 'always', etc. The standardization forum 3 GPP has specified the Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) while the standardization forum ITU-T has specified the Integrated Services Digital Networks  (ISDN) User Part (ISUP) call control protocol. Both of these standards rely on the use of Time Division Multiplex (TDM) as a media bearer and SS 7 as signalling bearer, where both bearers require use of very expensive telecom-specific hardware. The thesis proposes the solution to use RTP as media bearer and IP as signalling bearer towards the handset in GSM and only use TDM as media bearer and SS 7 as signalling bearer towards the VMS. The thesis demonstrates  the feasibility and the advantages provided, by creating an implementation in Erlang/OTP and testing it to check if it confirms to the specification...|$|E
40|$|The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) {{framework}} as {{an architectural}} framework to deliver multimedia services is under rapid development, {{to become the}} nextgeneration telecommunication service framework.

This master thesis contributes to this objective {{by the development of}} a prototype of a voicemail application server that integrates into the IMS architecture. Several communication protocols, among them SIP and MEGACO, were implemented for the integration of the application server with the IMS core network. All implementation was done using Erlang, a language widely used in telecom. After the prototype of the voice mail server was built, it was tested in an IMS simulation environment. The tests confirmed that the basic functionality of the voicemail was successfully implemented and that the integration with the IMS network was satisfactory.

40|$|<b>Voice</b> <b>mail</b> is a {{computer-aided}} {{telephone system}} which {{is capable of}} storing and forwarding spoken messages. The <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> market has been and is still focused on larger companies since they comprise a sizable amount of the installed base of voice processing systems (Radisich, 1994). Consequently, all <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> research has been centered on the large company and concentrates on advantages or disadvantages found in these substantial companies. This study focused on the implementation and diffusion of a relatively new communication technology and its consequences in an unresearched arena [...] the small company. Also a comparatively new methodology {{in the field of}} communications research, grounded theory, was used to explore the impact of a new technology, thus possibly advancing the credibility of this research methodology. The results of this pilot study on <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> in a small company found diffusion to be extremely successful, {{even to the point of}} surprising some of the subjects with their total acceptance of the technology. The study results indicated that the small company can benefit from <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> usage in similar ways to the large company, especially if the company has travelers or off-site locations. The results implied that there are some ways that <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> can assist in the small company where it has not previously had a reported effect in the large company [...] -as a negotiating, organizing, and delegating tool. The results of the study could provide insights for other small companies concerned with successful usage of the <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> technology in similar environments. Several concepts on novel uses of <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> surfaced as a result of this study. These concepts could provide hypothesis for empirical testing to further <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> investigation. The study concluded that <b>voice</b> <b>mail</b> is a communication technology that is an accepted and beneficial tool which offered several major advantages that the subject small company was able to successfully utilize.
