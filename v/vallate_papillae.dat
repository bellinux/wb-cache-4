40|$|SUMMARY: The <b>vallates</b> <b>papillae</b> lingual {{are located}} in the surface of the tongue in a area {{denominated}} of V lingual and it presents cells gustatory gathered in gustatory buttons. This research evaluated the height papilar in relation {{to the surface of the}} tongue of 519 lingual <b>vallates</b> <b>papillae.</b> 45 human tongue samples were selected, of both sexes, inside of the 40 - 50 year-old age group, obtained from necropsias accomplished in the Service of Verification of Deaths (S. V. O.) of UFPE/Secretaria of Health of the state of Pernambuco, in the city of Recife. The samples were classified different height levels accordingly in relation to the surface of the tongue, not establishing the exact height, where there was the predominance of the height above the lingual surface.

40|$|The {{postnatal}} maturation of the <b>vallate</b> <b>papilla</b> and its {{taste buds}} was quantitatively investigated in rats by light microscopy. Specifically, we measured postnatal {{increases in the}} size of mature vallate taste buds and the <b>vallate</b> <b>papilla,</b> increases in the thickness of the gustatory epidermis, and increases in the number of mature taste buds and taste cells per bud. Mature taste buds, defined as those having a taste pore, are rare at birth but proliferate rapidly during the first postnatal month until an average of 610 mature taste buds has accumulated by 90 days. Throughout this postnatal period, mature taste buds adjust to the developmental thickening of the epidermis by continuously increasing in length. Mature taste buds also increase in width, in part due to a threefold increase from 10 and 45 days in the number of taste cells per bud. From 10 to 21 days there is an average daily net increase of three cells per mature taste bud. The maturational increase in taste buds and cells may contribute to the functional changes in taste nerve responses known to occur {{over the course of several}} generations of taste receptor cells. The dimensions of the <b>vallate</b> <b>papilla</b> and the surface area of the gustatory epithelium increase logarithmically with age. Although mature taste buds continue to increase in number until 90 days, both taste bud density (178 /mm 2) and the number of cells per mature taste bud (70 – 75 cells) reach ceilings by 45 days. Thus, density-dependent factors appear to control vallate taste bud maturation. The immaturity of lingual taste buds in newborn rats supports the view that odor, rather than taste, is the chemosensory signal that guides suckling in altricial rodents...|$|R
40|$|Several hundred {{taste buds}} develop and mature in the trench {{walls of the}} rat's <b>vallate</b> <b>papilla</b> during the first 3 months after birth. The {{objective}} of this investigation of taste bud development was to determine: (i) whether the <b>vallate</b> <b>papilla</b> has local growth zones where new taste buds form, (ii) whether new taste buds arise by the division of mature taste buds, (iii) how many days are required for a new taste bud to mature, and (iv) whether a taste pore forms as the taste bud reaches a critical volume. Camera lucida drawings were made of more than 4000 iron hematoxylin-stained, serially sectioned, vallate taste buds. The relative abundance of immature taste buds declined exponentially with age, from 18 % of the mature taste buds at day 15 to 2 % at day 90. At days 21, 33 and 45 most of the immature taste buds (those lacking a taste pore) were located in growth zones at the anterior and posterior extremes of the vaUate trench. A mean of 10. 5 days was required for the maturation of each cohort of immature taste buds present at days 15, 21, 33 and 45. Vallate taste buds were added de novo; fission of mature taste buds was rare. Taste buds varied widely in the taste bud volume at which a pore formed and in the final volume of the taste bud...|$|R
50|$|The circumvallate {{papillae}} (or <b>vallate</b> <b>papillae)</b> are dome-shaped {{structures on}} the human tongue that vary in number from 8 to 12.They are situated {{on the surface of}} the tongue immediately in front of the foramen cecum and sulcus terminalis, forming a row on either side; the two rows run backward and medially, and meet in the midline.Each papilla consists of a projection of mucous membrane from 1 to 2 mm. wide, attached to the bottom of a circular depression of the mucous membrane; the margin of the depression is elevated to form a wall (vallum), and between this and the papilla is a circular sulcus termed the fossa.The papilla is shaped like a truncated cone, the smaller end being directed downward and attached to the tongue, the broader part or base projecting a little above the surface of the tongue and being studded with numerous small secondary papillæ and covered by stratified squamous epithelium.Ducts of lingual salivary glands, known as Von Ebner's glands empty a serous secretion into the base of the circular depression, which acts like a moat. The function of the secretion is presumed to flush materials from the base of circular depression to ensure that taste buds can respond to changing stimuli rapidly. The circumvallate papillae get special afferent taste innervation from cranial nerve IX, the glossopharyngeal nerve, even though they are anterior to the sulcus terminalis. The rest of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue gets taste innervation from the chorda tympani of cranial nerve VII, distributed with the lingual nerve of cranial nerve V.|$|E

40|$|We {{previously}} {{have published}} data detailing {{the time course of}} taste bud regeneration in the anterior tongue following transection of the chorda tympani (CT) nerve in the rat. This study extends the prior work by determining the time course of taste bud regeneration in the <b>vallate</b> <b>papilla,</b> soft palate and nasoincisor ducts (NID) following transection {{of either the}} glossopharyngeal (GL) or greater superficial petrosal (GSP) nerve. Following GL transection in rats (n = 6 per time point), taste buds reappeared in the <b>vallate</b> <b>papilla</b> between 15 and 28 days after surgery, and returned to 80. 3 % of control levels (n = 12) of taste buds by 70 days postsurgery. The first appearance and the final percentage of the normal complement of regenerated vallate taste buds after GL transection resembled that seen previously in the anterior tongue after CT transection. However, in the latter case, regenerated taste buds reached asymptotic levels by 42 days after surgery, whereas within the time frame of the present study, a clear asymptotic return of vallate taste buds was not observed. In contrast to the posterior (and anterior) tongue, only 25 % of the normal complement of palatal taste buds regenerated by 112 days and 224 days after GSP transection (n = 9). The difference in regenerative capacity might relate to the surgical approach used to transect the GSP. These experiments provide useful parametric data for investigators studying the functional consequences of gustatory nerve transection and regeneration...|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} peripheral taste system undergoes functional {{changes during}} postnatal development. These changes could reflect age-dependent alterations in the membrane properties of taste cells, which use {{a vast array}} of ion channels for transduction mechanisms. Yet, scarce information is available on the membrane events in developing taste cells. We have addressed this issue by studying voltage-dependent Na+, K+, and Cl- currents (I-Na, I-K, and I-Cl, respectively) in a subset of taste cells (the so-called Na/OUT cells, which are electrically excitable and thought to be sensory) from mouse <b>vallate</b> <b>papilla.</b> Voltage-dependent currents play a key role during taste transduction, especially in the generation of action potentials. Patch-clamp recordings revealed that I-Na, I-K, and I-Cl were expressed early in postnatal development. However, only I-K and I-Cl densities increased significantly in developing Na/OUT cells. Consistent with the rise of I-K density, we found that action potential waveform changed markedly, with an increased speed of repolarization that was accompanied by an enhanced capability of repetitive firing. In addition to membrane excitability changes in putative sensory cells, we observed a concomitant increase in the occurrence of glia-like taste cells (the so called leaky cells) among patched cells. Leaky cells are likely involved in dissipating the increase of extracellular K+ during action potential discharge in chemosensory cells. Thus, developing taste cells of the mouse <b>vallate</b> <b>papilla</b> undergo a significant electrophysiological maturation and diversification. These functional changes may have a profound impact on the transduction capabilities of taste buds during development...|$|R
40|$|In {{the adult}} mouse tongue, {{an average of}} 11 % of the {{gustatory}} receptor cells are replaced each day. In investigating homeostatic cell death mechanisms in gustatory renewing epithelium, we observed that taste receptor cells were selectively immunopositive for the bcl- 2 family death factor, Bax, and for the protease Caspase- 2 Nedd 2 /Ich 1. We determined that 8 – 10 % of the taste receptor cells of the <b>vallate</b> <b>papilla</b> were Bax positive and that 11 % were Caspase- 2 positive. Some of these immunopositive taste cells had apoptotic morphological defects. Within the subset of vallate taste cells immunopositive for either Caspase- 2 or Bax, up to 79 % coexpressed both death factors. Bax and Caspase- 2 first appeared in occasional vallate taste receptor cells on the same postnatal day—the day after birth. bax null mutation markedly reduced gustatory Caspase- 2 immunoexpression. These observations suggest that taste cell death pathways utilize p 53, Bax, and Caspase- 2 to dispose of aged receptor cells. Apart from reducing Caspase- 2 expression, Bax deficiency also altered taste organ development. bax −/− mice had a more profusely innervated <b>vallate</b> <b>papilla,</b> which grew to be 25 % longer and taller, with the mean taste bud containing {{more than twice the}} normal number of taste cells. This augmentation of taste organ development with increased innervation is complementary to the well-documented reduction in taste organ development with sparse innervation. We propose that additional taste neurons survived programmed cell death in Bax-deficient mice, thereby providing an inductive boost to vallate gustatory development. J. Comp.

40|$|Ciguatera is a food {{poisoning}} caused by toxins of Gambierdiscus toxicus, a marine dinoflagellate. The neurological {{features of this}} intoxication include sensory abnormalities, such as paraesthesia, heightened nociperception, and also taste alterations. Here, we have evaluated the effect of gambierol, one of the possible ciguatera toxins, on the voltage-gated ion currents in taste cells. Taste cells are excitable cells endowed with voltage-gated Na+, K+, and Cl currents (INa, IK, and ICl, respectively). By applying the patch-clamp technique to single cells in isolated taste buds obtained from the mouse <b>vallate</b> <b>papilla,</b> we have recorded such currents and determined the effect of bath-applied gambierol. We found that this toxin markedly inhibited IK in the nanomolar range (IC 50 of 1. 8 nM), whereas it showed no significant effect on INa or ICl even at high concentration (1 mM). The block of IK was irreversible even after a 50 -min wash. In addition to affecting th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Cytokeratins in {{taste buds}} were immunocyto-chemically {{evaluated}} with monoclonal antibodies. In each of six different epithelial {{sites in the}} rat oral cavity, intragemmal cells of taste buds were immunoreactive for keratin polypeptides 8, 18, and 19, {{as well as for}} keratin 7, which has not been previously reported in taste buds. Keratin- 18 -like immunoreactivity was present in fewer than half of the intragemmal cells, whereas all intragem-ma 1 cells were immunopositive for keratins 7, 8, and 19. Apart from some salivary duct cells, no other cells in the tongue were immunoreactive for any of these four kera-tins. Morphological and immunocytochemical profiles indicate that taste buds are islets of simple epithelium embedded in an expanse of stratified squamous epitheli-um. These simple epithelial cells and their keratins are nerve-dependent, since denervatiorf eliminated all four keratins and replaced elongated taste cells of the <b>vallate</b> <b>papilla</b> with stratified squamous epithelium. We con-clude that antibodies against keratins 7, 8, or 19 are use-ful markers for intragemmal cells in studies of taste bud development, degeneration, regeneration, turnover and tissue culture...|$|R
40|$|Taste {{cells in}} adult mammals are {{functionally}} heterogeneous {{as to the}} expression of ion channels. How these adult phenotypes are established during postnatal development, however, is not yet clear. We have addressed this issue by studying voltage-gated K+ and Cl – currents (IK and ICl, respectively) in developing taste cells of the mouse <b>vallate</b> <b>papilla.</b> IK and ICl underlie action potential waveform and firing properties, and {{play an important role}} in taste transduction. By using the patch clamp technique, we analyzed these currents in a specific group of cells, called Na/OUT cells and thought to be sensory. In adult mice, three different electrophysiological phenotypes of Na/OUT cells could be detected: cells with IK (K cells); cells with both IK and ICl (K+Cl cells); and cells with ICl (Cl cells). In contrast, at early developmental stages (2 – 4 postnatal days, PD) there were no Cl cells, which appeared at PD 8. Our findings indicate a mechanism that contributes to building-up the functional heterogeneity of mammalian taste cells during the postnatal development.

Macroscopically, the tongues presented elongated shape, rounded apex, body, root, median sulcus in the root's apex, and two <b>vallate</b> <b>papillae.</b> The mucous membrane of the tongue revealed a keratinized stratified pavement epithelium, while the ventral surface of the tongue was thin and smooth, not provided with any type of papillae.

Several neuronal fibers were detected under the chemoreceptorial epithelium. Some of these fibers were in contact with the taste buds and in some cases neuronal projections were also present between the buds or inside them; some others fibers were present below this layer but in a more peripheral area. Antibodies against CGRP, SP and CCK stained fibers just below the chemoreceptorial epithelium, whereas fibers more distally located were immunolabeled by anti VIP, NOS- 1 and NF- 200 antibodies. Some double staining experiments were conducted using confocal microscopy. Other sections were processed cytochemically for AChE and subsequently for NADPH-d in colocalization experiments. All the data obtained using these techniques confirmed the results obtained with single immunostaining, as did the ultrastructural results. In conclusion, the present work demonstrates that the subgemmal plexus is a bilayered structure, suggesting that the complex relationship between the two layers plays a pivotal role in taste and in the control of processes ancillary to taste, such as control of vascular or secretory mechanisms.

Application of capsaicin (30 micron) to the apex of the tongue or to the palatinal mucosa, but not to the radix of the tongue, caused a reproducible burning sensation and salivation from the submandibular-sublingual and parotid glands. The salivation response to capsaicin was reduced by methylscopolamine pretreatment. Similar levels of substance P immunoreactivity were present in the lingual apex and radix area (including <b>vallate</b> <b>papillae)</b> of man, while in the cat about 4 times higher levels of substance P immunoreactivity were present in the <b>vallate</b> <b>papillae</b> than in the lingual apex. Immunohistochemistry showed that in the cat many substance P immunoreactive nerves were associated with the taste buds of the <b>vallate</b> <b>papillae,</b> while in man substance P immunoreactive fibres were only seen penetrating into the epithelium of the lingual apex. In addition some subepithelial blood vessels in all regions were surrounded by substance P immunoreactive nerves in both cat and man. Citric acid application to the tongue apex caused both submandibular-sublingual and parotid salivary secretion concomitant with a burning sensation. Salivary secretion was also seen after citric acid application to the radix of the tongue. This response was associated with a sour taste. The salivation response to citric acid was not significantly reduced by methylscopolamine pretreatment. Lingual apex application of nicotine was associated with a sweet taste and a small rise in salivary secretion rate. This response was not significantly reduced by methylscopolamine. In conclusion, the sensitivity to capsaicin of the human tongue is restricted to the apex portion. This is in parallel with the occurrence of intraepithelial substance P immunoreactive nerve fibres. Capsaicin induced salivary secretion seems mainly to be mediated via parasympathetic, cholinergic reflex mechanisms. Citric acid and nicotine induced salivation responses are comparatively more resistant to methylscopolamine pretreatment...|$|E

Apoptosis was implicated {{by the presence of}} fragmented DNA in about 8 % of taste receptor cells in the <b>vallate</b> <b>papilla.</b> In using immunocytochemistry to seek putative death factors, we observed that squamous epithelial cells of the tongue were negative for Bax, a death factor in the Bcl- 2 family of survival/death factors, and were also negative for p 53, a tumor-suppressor protein linked to apoptosis and Bax transcription. In contrast, 8 – 10 % of the taste receptor cells were Bax-positive, and 9 – 11 % were p 53 positive. These immunopositive taste receptor cells were more likely to display death-related morphologic defects than other receptor cells, and they frequently coexpressed p 53 and Bax. In both neonatal and adult mice, the labeling of dividing cells with 5 -bromo- 2 ′-deoxyuridine indicated that all Bax-positive taste cells were at least 5 days old. On postnatal day 7, when few taste cells were old, no more than 1 % of taste cells were immunopositive for either p 53 or Bax. We inferred that old taste receptor cells employ p 53 and Bax as part of their apoptotic death pathway. The routine expression of p 53 by postmitotic, aged taste cells broadens the conventional view that p 53 is restricted to mitotic cells that have stress-damaged DNA. Furthermore, the scattered distribution of aged receptor cells within the taste bud excludes some explanations for stable taste signals during receptor cell turnover. J. Comp.

40|$|Capybara is {{the largest}} rodent {{in the world and}} {{displays}} a seasonally dependent herbivore feeding behavior. Here, we present an anatomical contribution for understand this fact, by light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy methodologies for tongue tissue analysis. the histological preparations revealed filiform, fungiform, <b>vallate,</b> and foliate <b>papillae</b> on the dorsal mucosa of the capybara tongue. the epithelial layer exhibited a lining of keratinized stratified squamous epithelial cells. the lamina propria was characterized by a dense connective tissue composed of the primary and secondary papillar projections. We also revealed the original aspects of the connective papillae. the shapes of the papillae varied by region of the tongue, and filiform, fungiform, <b>vallate,</b> and foliate <b>papillae</b> and subjacent layers of muscular fibers were observed. Pyriform taste buds occupying the epithelial layer of fungiform, <b>vallate</b> and foliate <b>papillae</b> were identified and the intracellular components of the taste buds and the intracorpuscular amyelinated nerve fibers were observed. the taste buds were characterized by the distribution of granular endoplasmic reticulum throughout the perinuclear area, the Golgi apparatus, and mitochondrial assemblies of various distinct diameters. Mitochondrial accumulation was also observed in the collagen bundle-surrounded amyelinated nerve fibers beside the basal cells. Therefore, these peculiar anatomical descriptions may contribute to understanding the adaptation of the feeding behavior of capybaras in a seasonally changing environment. Microsc. Res. Tech., 2013.

40|$|Taste buds are sensory {{structures}} {{made up by}} tightly packed, specialized {{epithelial cells}} called taste cells. Taste cells are functionally heterogeneous, and {{a large proportion of}} them fire action potentials during chemotransduction. In view of the narrow intercellular spaces within the taste bud, it is expected that the ionic composition of the extracellular fluid surrounding taste cells may be altered significantly by activity. This consideration has led to postulate the existence of glialike cells that could control the microenvironment in taste buds. However, the functional identification of such cells has been so far elusive. By using the patch-clamp technique in voltage-clamp conditions, I identified a new type of cells in the taste buds of the mouse <b>vallate</b> <b>papilla.</b> These cells represented about 30 % of cells patched in taste buds and were characterized by a large leakage current. Accordingly, I named them Leaky cells. The leakage current was carried by K+, and was blocked by Ba 2 + but not by tetraethylammonium (TEA). Other taste cells, such as those possessing voltage-gated Na+ currents and thought to be chemosensory in function, did not express any sizeable leakage current. Consistent with the presence of a leakage conductance, Leaky cells had a low input resistance (similar to 0. 25 G Omega). In addition, their zero-current (resting) potential was close to the equilibrium potential for potassium ions. The electrophysiological analysis of the membrane currents remaining after pharmacological block by Ba 2 + revealed that Leaky cells also possessed a Cl- conductance. However, in resting conditions the membrane of these cells was about 60 times more permeable to K+ than to Cl-. The resting potassium conductance in Leaky cells could be involved in dissipating rapidly the increase in extracellular K+ during action potential discharge in chemosensory cells. Thus Leaky cells might represent glialike elements in taste buds. These findings support a model in which specific cells control the chemical composition of intercellular fluid in taste buds...|$|R
40|$|A clear {{understanding}} of the role of different papillae in the pig may permit the development of a more palatable diet, thus, better utilizing anatomical structures and morphological characteristics to enhance health and productivity in this domestic species. The study used ten healthy market-size, mixed-breed pigs to properly describe the surface structure of the tongue papillae using standard scanning electron microscopic techniques. Two types of sharp and blunt filiform papillae were identified. Fungiform papillae, located on the lateral side of the tongue, were circular and large with surface taste pores. The majority of oval papillae on the dorsal surface of the tongue contained multidirectional surface grooves and lacked taste pores. The foliate papillae, located principally on the caudal third and lateral part of the tongue, were comprised of four to five leaves and they had additional pseudopapillae. The two <b>vallate</b> <b>papillae,</b> found in the caudal third and dorsum of the tongue, had a well-defined vallum and pseudopapillae on their surface. At the root of the tongue, two types of conical papillae with or without apex were observed. The entire area covered by conical papillae was deeply occupied by lingual tonsils. The lingual tonsils were scattered with varying sized lymph nodules in the propria mucosa of the conical papillae deep to epithelium. Functionally, the filiform and conical papillae appeared to have a mechanical role whereas fungiform, foliate, and <b>vallate</b> <b>papillae</b> apparently perform a gustatory role in the pig. The tonsillar location {{at the root of the}} tongue provides an ideal experimental model for immunohistological and immunological studies on the lymphoid tissue in man.

40|$|Amiloride-sensitive Na+ {{channels}} play {{an important}} role in transducing Na+ salt taste. Previous studies revealed that in rodent taste cells, the channel shares electrophysiological and pharmacological properties with the epithelial Na+ channel, ENaC. Using subunit-specific antibodies directed against alpha, beta, and gamma subunits of rat ENaC (rENaC), we observed cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for all three subunits in nearly all taste cells of fungiform papillae, and in about half of the taste cells in foliate and <b>vallate</b> <b>papillae.</b> The intensity of labeling in cells of <b>vallate</b> <b>papillae</b> was significantly lower than that of fungiform papillae, especially for beta and gamma subunits. Dual localization experiments showed that immunoreactivity for the taste cell-specific G protein, gustducin, occurs in a subset ofrENaC positive taste cells. Aldosterone is known to increase the amiloride sensitivity of the NaCl taste response. In our study, increases in blood aldosterone levels enhanced the intensity of apical immunoreactivity for beta and gamma rENaC in taste cells of all papillae. In addition, whole cell recordings from isolated taste cells showed that in fungiform papillae, aldosterone increased the number of amiloride-sensitive taste cells and enhanced the current amplitude. In vallate taste cells, which are normally unresponsive to amiloride, aldosterone treatment induced an amiloride sensitive current in about half of the cells. Immunoreactivity for rENaC subunits also was present in nonsensory epithelial cells, especially in the anterior portion of the tongue. In addition, immunoreactivity for all subunits, but especially beta and gamma, was associated with some nerve fibers innervating taste papillae. These extragustatory sites of rENaC expression may indicate a role for this channel in paracellular transduction of sodium ions...|$|E
40|$|The {{innervation}} pattern by primary {{afferent nerve}} fibres and the neurotrophic effect on taste cells were investigated in the guinea pig vallate taste bud {{by means of}} glossopharyngeal neurectomy and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) tracing. In the glossopharyngeal neurectomy study, taste buds in the <b>vallate</b> <b>papillae</b> of adult guinea pigs were denervated by unilateral resection of the right glossopharyngeal nerve. Denervated animals were killed on days 1, 3 and 5 and weeks 1 - 9, 12 and 24 postneurectomy. The results showed that, on the denervated side, the taste buds decreased significantly in number during the 1 st 2 wk, and disappeared completely by wk 3; no mature taste buds were present even 24 wk after neurectomy. This suggests that the vallate taste buds disappear {{in the absence of}} the glossopharyngeal nerve. In the neural tracing study, HRP or WGA-HRP was injected into the proximal end of the right glossopharyngeal nerve, near the jugular foramen. After a survival time of 24 h, the <b>vallate</b> <b>papillae</b> were sectioned and examined by light and electron microscopy. Light microscopy revealed that the HRP or WGA-HRP-labelled fibres innervated the vallate taste buds of the injected side. Most of the taste cells in the buds were labelled with HRP or WGA-HRP reaction products from the basal to the apical region. At the ultrastructural level, the reaction products were confined to the cytoplasm of the labelled cells, which were identified as type I, II and III cells, but not basal cells. Labelled intragemmal nerve profiles were seen among the taste cells. No synapse formation was seen with nerve profiles abutting on type I and II cells, whereas on certain type III cells, typical synapses were formed. We conclude that both the right and left vallate papilla in the guinea pig are unilaterally innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve without cross-innervation...|$|E
40|$|The G-protein subunit �-gustducin, {{which is}} similar to rod transducin, has been implicated in the {{transduction}} of both sweet- and bitter-tasting substances. In rodents, there are differences in sensitivity to sweet and bitter stimuli in different populations of taste buds. Rat fungiform taste buds are more responsive to salts than to sweet stimuli, whereas those on the palate respond predominantly to sweet substances. In contrast, hamster fungiform taste buds are more sensitive to sweet-tasting stimuli. Taste buds in the <b>vallate</b> and foliate <b>papillae</b> of both species are sensitive to bitter compounds. These differences in sensitivity should be reflected in the numbers of gustducin-containing cells in different taste bud populations. We examined taste buds in the rat and hamster for immunoreactivity to an antibody against �-gustducin. Immunofluorescence of labeled taste cells was examined by confoca...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{extensive}} immunological {{characterization of}} the cells within taste buds, {{little is known about}} the functional significance of the different cell types. In this study, we use taste cells isolated from mouse <b>vallate</b> and foliate <b>papillae</b> to characterize voltage-gated currents in the three principal elongate types of taste cells: type I, II, and III. Cell types are identified by using antibodies to external epitopes [antigen H for type I cells, antigen A for type II cells, and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) for type III cells]. In addition, we identify the subset of type II cells that contains �-gustducin, a G-protein involved in bitter transduction, by using transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of the gustducin promoter. Our results indicate that antigen H-immunoreactive (-IR) cells and many of the antigen A-IR cells have small voltage-gated inward Na � and outward K � currents but no voltage-gated Ca 2 � currents. In contrast, a subset of antigen A-IR cells and all NCAM-IR cells have large inward Na � and outward K � currents as well as voltage-gated Ca 2 � currents. Unexpectedly, all gustducin-expressing cells lacked voltage-gated Ca 2 � currents, suggesting that these cells use mechanisms other than classical synapses to communicate signals to the brain.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{three-dimensional}} structure {{and patterns of}} distribution of the lingual papillae of healthy rats (the norm) and their changes {{in the process of}} development of diabetes mellitus І type. The research was conducted on 65  laboratory rats of the Weestar line. The research investigated the mucus shell and the microcirculatory network of the tongue. The distribution and three-dimensional structure of the papillae of the tongue were studied using a scanning electron microscope. It was found that there are 5 morphological subspecies of filiform papillae on the dorsal surface of body of the tongue: true filifom, flattened, thin and giant conical and brush-like. Isolated fungiform papillaе are unevenly distributed between filiform papillaе. The dorso-lateral edge of the dorsal lingual surface is covered by foliate papillae. The unique oval <b>papilla</b> <b>vallate</b> is located in the back-end of the middle line of the root of the tongue. The far back of the root of the tongue lacks papillae, is flattened and covered by squamous formations. The distribution and types of lingual papillae is similar in rats to other rodents. In the process of development of diabetic glossitis a reduction in the height of different types of papillae of the tongue was observed, and an increase in the amount of keratinized mass, which plays a role in the fixation of microflora {{on the surface of the}} mucus shell, which as a result may lead to development of inflammatory process in the tongues of rats with experimental diabetes mellitus. The stages of morphological and morphometric changes in the mucus shell and microcirculatory network of the tongues of rats with diabetes mellitus were investigated, the characteristic signs of these changes were marked. On the basis of morpho-functional changes of the tongues of rats with experimental streptozotocin induced diabetes mellitus, two stages of development of pathomorphological changes were distinguished: 1) reactive changes (2 – 4 th week) and 2) destructive processes (6 – 8 th week). At the end of the first stage there was a reduction in height of the filiform papillae and width of mushroom-like papillae in the mucus shell of the tongue, an increase in its keratinization, a considerable reduction in the number of cells in the deeper layers of the epithelium of the tongue and the adsorption capacity of superficial epіtheliocites diminished, a significant reduction in the diameter of path clearance of all departments of the microcirculatory network is traced here. At the end of the secondary stage, there was a reduction in the sizes of all papillae of the back of the tongue, in all links of the microcirculatory network there was a development of diabetic microangiopathy which is characterized: by narrowing of the arterial and exchange links on a background expansion of capacity link. The question of influencing the pathological process in the vessels of the microcirculatory network on the state of the mucus shell of the tongue in animals with experimental streptozotocin induced diabetes mellitus is discussed...|$|R
