5|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} its sustainability, the university has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in 2017. In addition, it has pledged to employ low-flow faucets and shower heads, use sustainable materials like reprocessed flooring, recycle up to 90% of its debris, and seek LEED Silver certification in its construction of new facilities on campus. Also, the Department of Grounds Maintenance at Fordham has committed to making half of its <b>vehicle</b> <b>fleet</b> electric by 2016.

5|$|Sweden has {{achieved}} the largest E85 flexible-fuel <b>vehicle</b> <b>fleet</b> in Europe, {{with a sharp}} growth from 717 vehicles in 2001 to 243,136 through December 2014. As of 2008 a total of 70% of all flexifuel vehicles operating in the EU were registered in Sweden. The recent and accelerated growth of the Swedish fleet of E85 flexifuel vehicles {{is the result of}} the National Climate Policy in Global Cooperation Bill passed in 2005, which not only ratified the Kyoto Protocol but also sought to meet the 2003 EU Biofuels Directive regarding targets for use of biofuels, and also let to the 2006 government's commitment to eliminate oil imports by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Farmer {{was also}} criticized for his {{management}} of the agriculture department's <b>vehicle</b> <b>fleet.</b> Late in his first term, Farmer had removed the vehicles used by the Agriculture Department from the state fleet, opting to have department officials manage them separately. In 2010, the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a free market think tank, criticized the department's {{management of the}} vehicles under its control, citing {{the frequency with which}} the department's vehicles were being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted in 2010 that the department's fleet had grown from 178 to 206 vehicles since 2007 while the state's fleet had shrunk by 5%, and that all but three of the department's vehicles were fewer than four years old. A department spokesman defended the moves, citing decreased maintenance costs and higher resale values of vehicles being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted that such incidents could undermine Williams and Farmer's traditional Republican message of the need for less government spending.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe road {{transport}} system is moving, slowly but surely, away from using fossil fuels. Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are an energy-efficient alternative to conventional <b>vehicles.</b> Commercial <b>vehicle</b> <b>fleets</b> are an attractive entry for PEVa into the transport system. This paper presents findings from a three-year study of 550 PEVs and their users. A combination of technical {{and social science}} methods provides a basis for greater understanding of PEV operations in commercial <b>vehicle</b> <b>fleets.</b> This paper shows that battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have proven their functionality in several applications, but that winter conditions still imply an unjustified decrease in use. Usage varies according to application but results show that in general a substantial share of the battery capacity is redundant. Findings indicate that usage is not necessarily inhibited by the technical specifications of the battery but by the operational conditions in which commercial duties are performed. The only reliable alternative is to return with a large battery surplus. The vehicles studied have demonstrated their functionality and the users are positive. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) imply no restrictions in mobility, which results in high user satisfaction. Commercial <b>vehicle</b> <b>fleets</b> are suitable for PEV operations and with growing acceptance users have requested more PEVs hence a significant possibility exists to substitute {{a large share of}} the fossil-fuelled vehicles operating in commercial <b>vehicle</b> <b>fleets...</b>|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{foreseeable}} potential lies in shared <b>vehicle</b> <b>fleets.</b> In adequate regions (e.g. sub-urban regions) that (a) show trip patterns of inhabitants that are conform with an EV’s autonomy and that (b) are suitably provided with public recharge infrastructure, the typical hurdles of economic viability and battery capacity of an EV can be overcome. Furthermore, shared <b>vehicle</b> <b>fleets</b> {{will serve as}} great mean of publicity among private vehicle owners and help (in {{the same way as}} professional fleets) bring costs of EVs down due to increased demand. The economic viability of EVs in private vehicle ownership can therefore be facilitated.|$|R

25|$|The 2007 TfL report {{makes it}} clear that only a one-off {{reduction}} of emissions could be expected from the introduction of the charge, whilst further reductions are unlikely to be {{as a result of the}} charge.

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} counts/estimates of motor vehicles in New Zealand had them at 82,000 in 1925.
