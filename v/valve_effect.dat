40|$|We derive kinetic {{equations}} describing injection {{and transport}} of spin polarized carriers in organic semiconductors with hopping conductivity via an impurity level. The model predicts a strongly voltage dependent magnetoresistance, defined as resistance variation between devices with parallel and antiparallel electrode magnetizations (spin <b>valve</b> <b>effect).</b> The voltage {{dependence of the}} magnetoresistance splits into three distinct regimes. The first regime matches well known inorganic spintronic regimes, corresponding to barrier controlled spin injection or the well known conductivity mismatch case. The second regime at intermediate voltages corresponds to strongly suppressed magnetoresistance. The third regime develops at higher voltages and accounts for a novel paradigm. It is promoted by the strong non-linearity in the charge transport which strength {{is characterized by the}} dimensionless parameter $eU/k_BT$.

For the nonmagnetic metal both aluminium (Al) and copper (Cu) are used. Our multi-terminal geometry allows us to experimentally separate the spin <b>valve</b> <b>effect</b> from other magneto resistance signals such as the anomalous magneto resistance (AMR) and Hall effects.

In a 'non local' spin valve measurement we are able to completely isolate the spin valve signal and observe clear spin accumulation signals at T= 4. 2 K as well as at room temperature (RT). For aluminum we obtain spin relaxation lengths (lambda_{sf}) of 1. 2 mu m and 600 nm at T= 4. 2 K and RT respectively, whereas for copper we obtain 1. 0 mu m and 350 nm.
