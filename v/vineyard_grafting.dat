The extent of the ETcc reduction decreased over time as the cover crop regrew. Over the 28 -day period following the mowing, soil evaporation was 35 and 48 % lower than mowed and unmowed cover crop evapotranspiration, respectively.

40|$|Grapevine {{rootstocks}} {{have been}} {{an essential component of}} grape growing for over 150 years as rootstocks can impart desirable characteristics for grapevine growth. This review examined Italian and Sicilian literature on rootstocks, focusing on key issues including updates on needs for the future. Other related issues include the performance of major selection traits associated with salinity, drought, potassium uptake, vegetative growth, grape and wine quality and the propagation of grafted vines. Research on rootstocks started in Italy, and of course in other European Countries, once phylloxera was imported. In Italy, phylloxera was detected in Agrate (north Italy) in August 1879, but it may have been present since 1870. French and Italian researchers immediately understood that phylloxera resistance was common in American species of Vitis and in September 1879, the National Ampelographic Committee of Phylloxera was born in Italy. In 1880 the Italian Minister authorized the import of 0. 8 tons of Vitis rotundifolia, V. cordifolia, V. aestivalis and V. riparia seeds from Unites States. In 1883 more than 0. 3 tons of seeds were distributed: 185, 000 scions and 11, 300 vines of different biotypes of Solonis, Riparia, Rupestris, Berlandieri, Taylor, Vialla, Clinton, Cunningham, Jacquez. In 1884 another 800 Kg V. riparia seeds and 15, 000 scions of different species were distributed. From 1886 - 95, 36 nurseries were created on a total of 67 Hectares of cultivated surface. In order to develop research expertise, Dr. Paulsen (from Portici) and Dr. Silva (from Conegliano) went to France and later became the head of “Vivai Governativi di viti americane” in Palermo and Elba Island, respectively. From this period, research was concentrated on V. riparia and V. rupestris selections and in 1889 Palermo’s governmental nursery made the first crosses. Studies were also carried out on rootstock adaptability to different calcareous soils levels and adaptability to different environmental conditions. The important rootstocks were V. riparia, gloire and grand glabre, V. riparia x V. rupestris, 3306, 3309, V. berlandieri x V. riparia, 34 EM, 420 A, 157 / 11, V. rupestris du Lot and Aramon x Rupestris Ganzin n. 1. At the end of 1930 the national surface of replanted <b>vineyards</b> <b>grafted</b> on American rootstocks was 809, 091 hectares. In Sicily, V. riparia x V. rupestris hybrids were rejected because of grafting incompatibility with the local varieties and winegrape growers used Aramon x Rupestris Ganzin n. 1.

During the growing season several parameters were measured (leaf area, leaf water potential, leaf gas-exchanges, leaf layer number, canopy size, intercepted photosynthetically active radiation, fruit composition, yield and vigour). Basal leaf removal improved the canopy microclimate by a lower leaf layer number with positive effects on the interception of radiation at fruit zone, inferior percentage of interior leaves and clusters. On shoot density, it was verified that the D 2 presented the best conditions of canopy microclimate. Yield was positively influenced by shoot density increase by the augment of the cluster number, while cluster weight was not affected. Leaf removal had not a significant effect on yield parameters.

The experimental field belongs to the private company Dão Sul, Soc. Vitivinícola, SA, located at Dão region, in centre of Portugal. The <b>vineyard</b> was <b>grafted</b> in 1991 onto 1103 P rootstock. The training system is bilateral Royat with vertical shoot positioning. Three different shoot densities were assayed (at G stage of Baggiolini scale) : 23 shoots. m- 1 row (D 23), 17 shoots. m- 1 row (D 17) and 11 shoots. m- 1 row (D 11). At veraison, two other factors were introduced: leaf removal at fruit zone – LR 1 (no leaf removal - LR 0) and cluster thinning (30 %) – CT 1 (no cluster thinning – CT 0). During the growing season several parameters were measured: leaf area, leaf water potential, leaf gas-exchanges, leaf layer number (LLN), canopy size, intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), fruit composition, yield and vigour. The reduction of shoot density and clusters thinning slightly improved the canopy microclimate, while basal leaf removal affected these parameters in a stronger way. Basal leaf removal didn’t affect any of the yield parameters. The yield was, however, significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced by cluster thinning and, in 2005, by the decreasing of shoot density. Concerning the grape composition, the studied factors didn’t significantly affect any of its parameters. These results may lead us to presume that no intervention on vineyard would be desirable. However, we verified that D 23 treatment substantially increased pruning time (D 23 – 88 hours/ha, D 17 – 36 hours/ha, D 11 – 29 hours/ha).

40|$|There are {{approximately}} 90, 000 ha of grapes in Brazil including wine, juice and table grapes.

40|$|Crimson Seedless’ (Vitis vinifera L.) is an attractive, late season, red, {{seedless}} cultivar, {{which is}} currently a very popular table grape cultivar. It {{is one of the}} most planted cultivars in South Africa and third in terms of total area of table grape vineyards in production. Mature ‘Crimson Seedless’ grapes are characterized by outstanding eating quality, good flavour, firm and crisp berries. One of the key factors affecting the yield of table grape cultivars is bud fruitfulness. Low fruitfulness can have a significant effect on the yield of table grape cultivars and ‘Crimson Seedless’ is characterized by a fruitfulness problem. Summer pruning, such as the removal of shoots after harvesting grapes, is a cultivation practice widely used by some table grape producers in the Orange River region of South Africa. The first hypothesis of this study stated that the removal of shoots after harvest will increase the transmitted PAR through the canopy, increase carbohydrate reserve levels in canes and improve bud fruitfulness of ‘Crimson Seedless’. A second hypothesis of this study stated that the cut back of all main shoots and shoots developing from spurs to the nearest lateral shoot and the removal of all unproductive shoots after berry set will result in fruitful shoots the following season. The third and final hypothesis of this study stated that the removal of shoots after harvest and berry set will improve the yield and quality of Vitis vinifera cv. ‘Crimson Seedless’. The study was conducted over three seasons (2010 / 11 to 2012 / 13) and aimed at investigating factors, including shoot removal, impacting bud fruitfulness of an 11 -year-old commercial V. vinifera L. cv. ‘Crimson Seedless’ <b>vineyard,</b> <b>grafted</b> on ‘Ramsey’ (Vitis champinii) rootstocks in the Hex River Valley. The treatment design was a complete randomized design and involved five treatments, which included 33 % shoot removal (S 33) and 66 % shoot removal (S 66) after harvest, cutting of all main and lateral shoots developing from spurs to the nearest lateral shoot (LS), removal of all unproductive shoots (RSB) which was compared with the control, in which standard pruning practices were performed. The results obtained in this experiment showed that shoot removal after harvest and after berry set improves PAR transmission into the canopy, but there was no significant impact on bud fruitfulness. In addition, it was found that shoot removal reduced vegetative growth resulting in thinner canes that also led to the improvement in PAR transmission. Furthermore, bunch number per shoot in the LS treated vines was reduced when compared with S 33 treated vines, illustrating that shoot removal at berry set can reduce bunch number per shoot due to defoliation after berry set. The significant decrease in bud burst in the S 33 treatments compared with the control was expected due to less shoots, resulting in a reduction in cane mass during the 2010 / 11 season. The significant effect of LS treatments after berry set on TSS and total red pigments compared with the S 66 treatments and the control, respectively, clearly indicates that shoot removal after berry set improves grape colour. The positive effect of LS treatments on colour was supported by the significant improvement in class 4 bunches, representing an improvement in quality. Although shoot removal did not have a significant effect on the bunch mass per vine of ‘Crimson Seedless’, there was a significant reduction in total bunches for export and mass of the total export bunches in the LS treatments in the 2011 / 12 season. A link between carbohydrate concentration in canes and bud fruitfulness was not found in this study, as S 33 and S 66 treatments did not have a significant effect on carbohydrate content in canes during the 2011 / 12 season. The question therefore arises whether the treatments applied during the growing seasons are worthwhile, because there was no significant impact on bud fruitfulness of Vitis vinifera L. cv. ‘Crimson Seedless’. This study illustrates that growers need to decide whether it is worthwhile to utilize labour for this practice and they must manage grapevines not only for the current seasons crop, but also for the next season and this can be accomplished by maintaining sufficient carbohydrates for fruitfulness and yield from season to season.

40|$|Grapevines were {{propagated}} from cuttings {{up until}} the late 19 th century when the soil-borne aphid phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae [Fitch]) destroyed Vitis vinifera L. vines grown on their own roots. The damaging import of grape phylloxera to France in 1868 led to extensive international research and collaboration to save European viticulture. Numerous growers, breeders and scientists played important roles in the historic campaign against the grape phylloxera and in finding {{the solution to this}} problem, which ultimately lay in grafting European vines on American rootstocks. Nowadays, more than 80 % of the <b>vineyards</b> worldwide use <b>grafted</b> plants: a scion of V. vinifera grafted onto a rootstock of single American Vitis species or interspecific hybrids of Vitis species that combine desirable features of their parentage. The majority of rootstocks used today were bred {{at the end of the}} 19 th century or at the turn of the 20 th century. They are mainly hybrids of four species: V. berlandieri, V. riparia, V. rupestris and V. vinifera, but secondary species have also been used. In addition to phylloxera, rootstocks contribute to the control of other soil-borne pests such as nematodes and to various abiotic constraints such as drought, salinity, limestone and mineral nutrition problems. They also strongly interact with scion genotypes and modify whole plant development, biomass accumulation and repartition, and phenology. In the context of climate change, they may be considered as a key element of adaptation. Rootstock breeding programs in the main grape growing countries around the world aim to improve pest resistance and adaptation to abiotic stresses. This article will give an overview of the history of rootstock use in the world, a brief description of the main rootstocks cultivated and some details on current breeding programs...|$|R
