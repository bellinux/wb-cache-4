6000|$|Yet the rice-fed Li Tee {{suffered}} most {{in their}} privations. His habitual apathy increased {{with a certain}} physical lethargy which Jim could not understand. When they were apart he sometimes found Li Tee stretched on his back with an odd stare in his eyes, and once, at a distance, {{he thought he saw}} a vague thin <b>vapor</b> <b>drift</b> from where the Chinese boy was lying and vanish as he approached. When he tried to arouse him there was a weak drawl in his voice and a drug-like odor in his breath. Jim dragged him to a more substantial shelter, a thicket of alder. It was dangerously near the frequented road, but a vague idea had sprung up in Jim's now troubled mind that, equal vagabonds though they were, Li Tee had more claims upon civilization, through those of his own race who were permitted to live among the white men, and were not hunted to [...] "reservations" [...] and confined there like Jim's people. If Li Tee was [...] "heap sick," [...] other Chinamen might find and nurse him. As for Li Tee, he had lately said, in a more lucid interval: [...] "Me go dead--allee samee Mellikan boy. You go dead too--allee samee," [...] and then lay down again with a glassy stare in his eyes. Far from being frightened at this, Jim attributed his condition to some enchantment that Li Tee had evoked from one of his gods--just as he himself had seen [...] "medicine-men" [...] of his own tribe fall into strange trances, and was glad that the boy no longer suffered. The day advanced, and Li Tee still slept. Jim could hear the church bells ringing; he knew it was Sunday--the day on which he was hustled from the main street by the constable; the day on which the shops were closed, and the drinking saloons open only at the back door. The day whereon no man worked--and for that reason, though he knew it not, the day selected by the ingenious Mr. Skinner and a few friends as especially fitting and convenient for a chase of the fugitives. The bell brought no suggestion of this--though the dog snapped under his breath and stiffened his spine. And then he heard another sound, far off and vague, yet one that brought a flash into his murky eye, that lit up the heaviness of his Hebraic face, and even showed a slight color in his high cheek-bones. He lay down on the ground, and listened with suspended breath. He heard it now distinctly. It was the Boston boy calling, and the word he was calling was [...] "Jim." ...|$|E
40|$|A {{fairly common}} {{occurrence}} in late June and July is {{the appearance of}} distorted leaves on soybean plants. The {{most common cause of}} this response is exposure to a growth regulator herbicide (2, 4 -D; dicamba; etc.). Dicamba is the most commonly used growth regulator herbicide in Iowa crop production, and is present in numerous products (Banvel®, Clarity®, Marksman®, Distinct®, Status®, and many others). Soybeans may be exposed to dicamba in three ways: spray particle drift, <b>vapor</b> <b>drift</b> (volatilization), and sprayer contamination. Injury from spray drift or sprayer contamination usually is fairly straightforward in diagnosing, but questions often arise regarding volatilization...|$|E
40|$|This NebGuide {{discusses}} {{conditions that}} cause particle drift, and methods private and commercial applicators may employ to reduce drift potential from pesticide spray applications. Spray drift of pesticides {{away from the}} target is an important and costly problem facing both commercial and private applicators. Drift causes many problems including: 1. damage to susceptible off target sites, 2. a lower rate than intended which can reduce {{the effectiveness of the}} pesticide, wasting pesticide and money, and 3. environmental contamination, such as water pollution and illegal pesticide residues. Drift occurs by two methods; <b>vapor</b> <b>drift</b> and particle drift. This NebGuide focuses mainly on conditions that cause particle drift, and methods to reduce the drift potential of spraying pesticides...|$|E
50|$|At 10:53, an {{explosion}} in the cargo hold occurred; the reasons are unknown. It is supposed that some of the fuel tanks were damaged and fuel <b>vapors</b> <b>drifted</b> into the burning cargo hold, causing {{an explosion}}.|$|R
60|$|The figure vanished. There was a flash {{behind the}} broken {{window and the}} shock of an explosion. For a moment the hovel was filled with light; then it tottered and {{a cloud of smoke}} rolled about the falling walls. Blocks of hard clay splashed in the creek and fell about the marsh. The smoke cleared and Carrie saw the dabbin had gone. A pile of rubbish, round which thin <b>vapor</b> <b>drifted,</b> marked the spot it had occupied. A man stood {{on the end of the}} ridge of high ground, his bent figure {{outlined}} against the sky, holding up his arms as if in protest. Then he vanished, and Jim and the others started silently for Langrigg.|$|R
60|$|Beyond the aloes, {{the white}} walls rose glaringly bright with smears of bluish <b>vapor</b> <b>drifting</b> from every opening, though the smoke was {{thickest}} about one wide gap between them. As he watched it, oblivious {{of the rifle}} in his hand, there was a thin whirling of flame {{in the midst of}} the vapor, and a sound that resembled a rapid hammering came sharply through the din. Then a strip of the mud wall crumbled into dust, which made a haze about the garden, and a spurt of flung‐up soil struck him in the face. A man behind him screamed, and while there was a pattering among the bananas close on his right Appleby crawled past him.|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a computer pro- gram for steady-state and transient BWR subchannel analysis. The conservation equations for the subchannels are obtained by area-averaging of the two-fluid model conservation equa- tions and reducing them to the drift-flux model formulation. The conservation equations are solved by a marching type technique which limits the code to analysis of operational transients only. The transfer of mass, momentum and energy between adjacent subchannels is split into diversion cross- flow and turbulent mixing components. The transfer of mass by turbulent mixing is assumed to occur in a volume-for- volume scheme reflecting experimental observations. The phenomenon of lateral <b>vapor</b> <b>drift</b> and mixing enhancement with flow regime are included in the mixing model of the program. The following experiments are used for the purpose of the assessment of the code under steady-state conditions: 1) GE Nine-Rod tests with radially uniform and nonuniform heating 2) Studsvik Nine-rod tests with strong radial power tilt 3) Ispra Sixteen-rod tests with radially uniform heating Comparison of calculated results with these data shows that the program is capable of predicting the correct trends in exit mass velocity and quality distributions.

40|$|The WOSUB-codes are {{spin-offs}} and {{extensions of}} the MATTEO-code [1]. The series of three reports describe WOSUB-I and WOSUB-II in their respective status as of July 31, 1977. This report is the third {{in a series of}} three, the first of which [2] contains all the information about the models, solution methods and constitutive equations and the second [3] being the user's manual of the code. This report summarizes the assessment of the WOSUB- code against experiments and compares its results with the results of other subchannel codes. The following experiments are used for the purpose of the assessment of the code under steady-state conditions: 1) 9 -rod GE-tests with radially uniform and non- uniform peaking factor patterns. 2) 16 -rod Columbia tests with slight power tilts. 3) Planned 9 -rod Swedish tests with very strong power tilts. 4) Actually performed 9 -rod Swedish tests with power tilt. 5) 9 -rod GE-CHF experiments. The comparison with these data shows that WOSUB is capable of predicting the lower-than-average behavior of the corner sub- channel and the higher-than-average behavior of the center subchannel for both quality and mass flux. None of the other well-known subchannel codes is indeed capable of specifically predicting the correct corner subchannel behavior. These codes seem to inherently suffer from major deficiencies associated with their incorporated mixing models. Therefore, it is con- cluded that only improved models for the description of two- phase flow phenomena are capable of handling these situations and that the <b>vapor</b> <b>drift</b> flux model together with the vapor diffusion model as incorporated into WOSUB is doing a good job. The fact that WOSUB does not perfectly match the experimental results over the whole spectrum of experimental evidence {{can be attributed to the}} vapor diffusion model which was originally fitted to air-water test results in a geometry consisting of two subchannels only. Obviously, this geometry leads to over- emphasizing the importance of the vapor diffusion as compared to what actually happens in a multi-rod geometry. WOSUB gives the user the option of calculating the critical power as a function of the boiling length - a concept which is especially useful to easily account for axially nonuniform power profiles and which closely resembles the procedure now used by GE. Furthermore, the code determines four heat transfer coefficients around the circumference of the fuel pin, thus giving the user the possibility of selecting the minimal one for the purpose of hot spot calculations. Overall, the assessment and comparison presented in this volume show that the WOSUB-code has to be considered a valuable tool for BWR bundle and PWR test bundle analysis with a potential for further improvements. The commonly used concept of power-to-flow ratio fails to explain most of the test data used for comparison in this report. The WOSUB-code is still in the stage of evolutionary development. In this context, the results presented in this present report have to be considered preliminary. They reflect the development as of July 1977...|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} full moon, {{the night was}} calm, and the flowing tide rippled among the {{mangrove}} roots. Clammy <b>vapor</b> <b>drifted</b> about the ship and big drops fell from the rigging and splashed upon the deck. A plume of smoke went nearly straight up from the funnel, and now and then the clang of furnace-slice and shovel rose from the stokehold, for Mayne hoped to float the vessel next tide. For the most part, however, the men were asleep {{and it was very}} quiet in the room under the poop. A lamp tilted at a sharp angle gave a feeble light that touched Adam's face.

50|$|Across Slovenia {{there are}} many oronyms, {{regional}} names, and microptoponyms named Pekel 'hell'. In folk geography, the name was used to metaphorically designate chasms, caves, shafts, and other narrow, dark places; for example, in Kropa there is an oeconym Pekel originally referring to a blacksmith's shop. Semantically related names in Slovenia include Devil's Hole (Vragova luknja) in the settlement of Okrog and Devil's Ravine (Hudičev graben) in the settlement of Parož. The cave's dark, black entrance inspired {{the idea that the}} Devil lived inside. Other stories of the name's origin say that one of the rocks near the entrance was thought to look like the Devil or that warm water <b>vapor</b> <b>drifting</b> from the cave in the winter had an eerie effect.

60|$|In vain {{they had}} {{strained}} their eyes through the darkness, to catch, by the fitful {{glare of the}} flashes, the tall masts of the Spaniard. Of one thing {{at least they were}} certain, that with the wind as it was, she could not have gone far to the westward; and to attempt to pass them again, and go northward, was more than she dare do. She was probably lying-to ahead of them, perhaps between them and the land; and when, a little after midnight, the wind chopped up to the west, and blew stiffly till day break, they felt sure that, unless she had attempted the desperate expedient of running past them, they had her safe in the mouth of the Bristol Channel. Slowly and wearily broke the dawn, on such a day as often follows heavy thunder; a sunless, drizzly day, roofed with low dingy cloud, barred and netted, and festooned with black, a sign that the storm is only taking breath awhile before it bursts again; while all the narrow horizon is dim and spongy with <b>vapor</b> <b>drifting</b> before a chilly breeze. As the day went on, the breeze died down, and the sea fell to a long glassy foam-flecked roll, while overhead brooded the inky sky, and round them the leaden mist shut out alike the shore and the chase.|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{then turned}} his eye upward {{to look at}} the clouds. In one place {{there seemed to be a}} break among them, and the fleecy masses around the break were slowly moving along. The place where Rollo was looking was about the middle of the sky; that is, about midway between the horizon and the zenith.[5] While Rollo was looking at this break, which seemed, while he looked at it, to {{brighten}} up and open more and more, he saw suddenly, to his utter amazement, a large green tree burst into view in the midst of it, and then disappear again a moment afterwards as a fresh mass of cloudy <b>vapor</b> <b>drifted</b> over. Rollo was perfectly bewildered with astonishment. To see a green tree, clear and distinct in form and bright with the beams of the sun which just at that instant caught upon it, breaking out to view suddenly high up among the clouds of the sky, seemed truly an astonishing spectacle. Rollo had scarcely recovered from the first emotion of his surprise before the clouds parted again, wider than before, and brought into view, first a large mass of foliage, which formed the termination of a grove of trees; then a portion of a smooth, green field, with a flock of sheep feeding upon it, clinging apparently to the steep slope like flies to a wall; and finally a house, with a little blue smoke curling from the chimney. Rollo was perfectly beside himself with astonishment and delight at this spectacle; and he determined immediately to go and ask his uncle to come and see.|$|R
60|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} the youth pulled in his horse and studied with the closest care a big cloud looming in the sky. All day snowy thunderheads had been emerging into view near the horizon, blooming like gigantic roses out of the deep purple of the sky, but this particular cloud had not changed its sharp, clean-cut outline for an hour, and, as he looked, a veil of <b>vapor</b> suddenly <b>drifted</b> away from it, and Mose's heart leaped with exultation, as though a woman's hand had been laid on his shoulder. That cloud-like form was a mountain! It could be nothing else, for while all around it other domes shifted line and mass, this one remained constant, riding through the mist as the moon endures {{in the midst of}} the flying vapor of the night.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report the {{preliminary}} findings of hydrogen vapor cloud dispersion experiments conducted by NASA.

Instrumented towers, located downwind of the spill site, gather data on the temperature, hydrogen concentration, and turbulence levels as the hydrogen <b>vapor</b> cloud <b>drifted</b> downwind.

60|$|It was not {{a cheerful}} {{prospect}} he looked down upon, and that evening the desolation of the surroundings reacted upon him.

60|$|They went on, {{and when}} {{darkness}} fell they pitched their light tent beside the creek. It was now freezing hard, and after supper the men lay smoking, wrapped in blankets, with the tent {{between them and}} the stinging wind, while a great fire of cedar branches snapped and roared in front of them. Sometimes the red blaze shot up, flinging a lurid light on the stately trunks and tinging the men's faces with the hue of burnished copper; sometimes it fanned out away from them while the sparks drove along the frozen ground and the great forest aisle, growing dim, was filled with <b>drifting</b> <b>vapor.</b> The latter was aromatic; pungently fragrant.|$|R
60|$|It was by {{his order}} the {{shattered}} leading company flung {{itself into the}} houses when the Sin Verguenza were met by an enfilading volley as they reeled into the calle. The street might have proved a death‐trap while the cazadores held the windows, but one could pass along the roofs, and the troops came out headlong when the Sin Verguenza descended upon them from above. Then they in turn found the calle too hot to hold them when they faced the fire of the second company which had taken shelter in the doorways. It was strewn with huddled objects lying upon the hot stones when they fled out of it, {{and a few minutes}} later Appleby stopped close by where Tony stood in the larger plaza. Tony’s face was set and white, though there was a curious gleam in his eyes, and he seemed to shiver a little as he glanced back up the glaring street. It was very still now, a narrow gap between the white walls that were ridged with shattered green lattices, but filmy wisps of <b>vapor</b> still <b>drifted</b> out of the doorways.|$|R
60|$|Then another rifle flashed, {{there was}} a sudden shouting, and a tumultuous patter of naked feet, and a shadowy mass of running figures hurled {{themselves}} at the stockade. A good many of them never reached it, for the dusky barrier blazed with twinkling points of light, and a withering volley met them in the face. Then the drifting smoke was rent by brighter snapping flashes in quick succession, and the jarring thud of heavier reports broke through the crash of the rifles. This lasted for perhaps two minutes, and then there was by contrast a silence that was almost bewildering. It seemed emphasized when once or twice the ringing of a rifle came out of the streaks of <b>drifting</b> <b>vapor</b> that hung about the stockade.|$|R
60|$|Two {{days had}} slipped away since Jimmy joined the Tyee, when, with her dew-wet canvas slatting at every roll, she crept {{out from the}} narrow waters into the Pacific.

To starboard the shore of Vancouver Island rose, a faint blur of misty pines, and ahead the sea was dimmed by <b>drifting</b> <b>vapors</b> out of which the long swell swung glassily. At times a wandering zephyr crisped it with a darker smear, and the Tyee crawled ahead a little. Then she stopped again, heaving her bows high out of the oily sea, while everything in her banged and rattled.|$|R
6000|$|Scarcely had I seated myself {{before a}} great brown animal, with black eyes, round and fierce, {{rose to the}} surface of the stream half a dozen yards from my feet; then quickly {{catching}} sight of me, it plunged noisily again under water, breaking the clear image reflected there with a hundred ripples. I waited for the last wavelet to fade away, but when the surface was once more still and smooth as dark glass, I began to be affected by the profounded silence and melancholy of nature, and by a something proceeding from nature--phantom, emanation, essence, I know not what. My soul, not my sense, perceived it, standing with finger on lips, there, close to me; its feet resting on the motionless water, which gave no reflection of its image, the clear amber sunlight passing undimmed through its substance. To my soul its spoken [...] "Hush!" [...] was audible, and again, and yet again, it said [...] "Hush!" [...] until the tumult in me was still, and I could not think my own thoughts. I could thereafter only listen, breathless, straining my senses to catch some natural sound, however faint. Far away in the dim distance, in some blue pasture, a cow was lowing, and the recurring sound passed me like the humming flight of an insect, then fainter still, like an imagined sound, until it ceased. A withered leaf fell from the tree-top; I heard it fluttering downwards, touching other leaves in its fall until the silent grass received it. Then, as I listened for another leaf, suddenly from overhead came the brief gushing melody of some late singer, a robin-like sound, ringing out clear and distinct as a flourish on a clarionet: brilliant, joyous, and unexpected, yet in keeping with that melancholy quiet, affecting the mind like a spray of gold and scarlet embroidery on a pale, neutral ground. The sun went down, and in setting, kindled the boles of the old trees here and there into pillars of red fire, while others in deeper shade looked by contrast like pillars of ebony; and wherever the foliage was thinnest, the level rays shining through imparted to the sere leaves a translucence and splendor that was like the stained glass in the windows of some darkening cathedral. All along the river a white mist began to rise, a slight wind sprang up and the <b>vapor</b> <b>drifted,</b> drowning the reeds and bushes, and wreathing its ghostly arms about the old trees: and watching the mist, and listening to the [...] "hallowed airs and symphonies" [...] whispered by the low wind, I felt that there was no longer any anger in my heart. Nature, and something in and yet more than nature, had imparted her [...] "soft influences" [...] and healed her [...] "wandering and distempered child" [...] until he could no more be a [...] "jarring and discordant thing" [...] in her sweet and sacred presence.|$|R

60|$|While Hawkeye and the Indians lighted their fire, {{and took}} their evening's repast, a frugal meal of dried bear's meat, {{the young man}} {{paid a visit to}} that curtain of the {{dilapidated}} fort which looked out on the sheet of the Horican. The wind had fallen, and the waves were already rolling on the sandy beach beneath him, in a more regular and tempered succession. The clouds, as if tired of their furious chase, were breaking asunder; the heavier volumes, gathering in black masses about the horizon, while the lighter scud still hurried above the water, or eddied among the tops of the mountains, like broken flights of birds, hovering around their roosts. Here and there, a red and fiery star struggled through the <b>drifting</b> <b>vapor,</b> furnishing a lurid gleam of brightness to the dull aspect of the heavens. Within the bosom of the encircling hills, an impenetrable darkness had already settled; and the plain lay like a vast and deserted charnel-house, without omen or whisper to disturb the slumbers of its numerous and hapless tenants.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there was}} bustle and hurry. Julius Savine raised his hand, and Tom from Mattawa whirled high the unfurled flag. Somebody beat upon an iron sheet {{invisible}} below and {{the strip of}} beach {{in the depths of}} the cañon became alive with running men. Next followed a deep stillness intensified by the clamor of the river which would never raise the same wild harmonies again, for the slender hand of a woman had bound it fast henceforward under man's dominion. The hush was ended suddenly. For a second the great hollow seemed filled with tongues of flame; then, while thick smoke quenched them and crag and boulder crumbled to fragments, a stunning detonation rang from rock to rock and rolled upwards into the frozen silence of untrodden hills. Huge masses which eddied and whirled, filling the gorge with the crash of their descent leaped out of the vapor; there was a ceaseless shock and patter of smaller fragments, and then, while long reverberations rolled among the hills, the roar of the tortured river drowned the mingled din. Rising, tremendous in its last revolt, its majestic diapason was deepened by the boom of grinding rock and the detonation of boulders reduced to powder. The draught caused by the water's passage fanned the smoke away, and the blue <b>vapor,</b> curling higher, <b>drifted</b> past the staging, so that Helen could only dimly see a great muddy wave foam down the cañon, bursting here and there into gigantic upheavals of spray. She watched it, held silent, awe-stricken, by the sound and sight.|$|R
40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{objective of}} the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management System (CRWMS) Program is to safely emplace and isolate the nations` spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and radioactive wastes in a geologic repository. Radioactive waste emplaced in a geologic repository will generate heat, increasing {{the temperature in the}} repository. The magnitude of this temperature increase depends upon (1) the heat source, i. e. the thermal loading of the repository, and (2) the geologic and engineered heat transport characteristics of the repository. Thermal management techniques currently under investigation include ventilation of the emplacement drifts during the preclosure period which could last as long as 100 years. Understanding the amount of heat and moisture removed from the emplacement drifts and near-field rock by ventilation, are important in determining performance of the engineered barrier system (EBS), as well as the corrosive environment of the waste packages, and the interaction of the EBS with the near-field host rock. Since radionuclide releases and repository system performance are significantly affected by the corrosion rate related to the psychometric environment, it is necessary to predict the amount of heat and moisture that are removed from the repository horizon using a realistic model {{for a wide range of}} thermal loading. This can be realized by coupling the hydrothermal model of the rock mass to a ventilation/climate model which includes the heat and moisture transport on the rock-air interface and the dilution of water <b>vapor</b> in the <b>drift.</b> This paper deals with the development of the coupled model concept, and determination of the boundary conditions for the calculations...|$|R

60|$|And be it {{remembered that}} all these faults and {{deficiencies}} {{are to be found}} in their drawing merely of the separate masses of the solid cumulus, the easiest drawn of all clouds. But nature scarcely ever confines herself to such masses; they form but the thousandth part of her variety of effect. She builds up a pyramid of their boiling volumes, bars this across like a mountain with the gray cirrus, envelops it in black, ragged, <b>drifting</b> <b>vapor,</b> covers the open part of the sky with mottled horizontal fields, breaks through these with sudden and long sunbeams, tears up their edges with local winds, scatters over the gaps of blue the infinity of multitude of the high cirri, and melts even the unoccupied azure into palpitating shades. And all this is done over and over again in every quarter of a mile. Where Poussin or Claude have three similar masses, nature has fifty pictures, made up each of millions of minor thoughts--fifty aisles penetrating through angelic chapels to the Shechinah of the blue--fifty hollow ways among bewildered hills--each with their own nodding rocks, and cloven precipices, and radiant summits, and robing vapors, but all unlike each other, except in beauty, all bearing witness to the unwearied, exhaustless operation of the Infinite Mind. Now, in cases like these especially, as we observed before of general nature, though it is altogether hopeless to follow out in the space of any one picture this incalculable and inconceivable glory, yet the painter can at least see that the space he has at his command, narrow and confined as it is, is made complete use of, and that no part of it shall be without entertainment and food for thought. If he could subdivide it by millionths of inches, he could not reach the multitudinous majesty of nature; but it is at least incumbent upon him to make the most of what he has, and not, by exaggerating the proportions, banishing the variety and repeating the forms of his clouds, to set at defiance the eternal principles of the heavens--fitfulness and infinity. And now let us, keeping in memory what we have seen of Poussin and Salvator, take up one of Turner's skies, and see whether he is as narrow in his conception, or as niggardly in his space. It does not matter which we take, his sublime Babylon[33] is a fair example for our present purpose. Ten miles away, down the Euphrates, where it gleams last along the plain, he gives us a drift of dark elongated vapor, melting beneath into a dim haze which embraces the hills on the horizon. It is exhausted with its own motion, and broken up by the wind in its own body into numberless groups of billowy and tossing fragments, which, beaten by the weight of storm down to the earth, are just lifting themselves again on wearied wings, and perishing in the effort. Above these, and far beyond them, the eye goes back to a broad sea of white, illuminated mist, or rather cloud melted into rain, and absorbed again before that rain has fallen, but penetrated throughout, whether it be vapor or whether it be dew, with soft sunshine, turning it as white as snow. Gradually as it rises, the rainy fusion ceases, you cannot tell where the film of blue on the left begins--but it is deepening, deepening still,--and the cloud, with its edge first invisible, then all but imaginary, then just felt when the eye is not fixed on it, and lost when it is, at last rises, keen from excessive distance, but soft and mantling in its body, as a swan's bosom fretted by faint wind, heaving fitfully against the delicate deep blue, with white waves, whose forms are traced by the pale lines of opalescent shadow, shade only because the light is within it, and not upon it, and which break with their own swiftness into a driven line of level spray, winnowed into threads by the wind, and flung before the following vapor like those swift shafts of arrowy water which a great cataract shoots into the air beside it, trying to find the earth. Beyond these, again, rises a colossal mountain of gray cumulus, through whose shadowed sides the sunbeams penetrate in dim, sloping, rain-like shafts; and over which they fall in a broad burst of streaming light, sinking to the earth, and showing through their own visible radiance the three successive ranges of hills which connect its desolate plain with space. Above, the edgy summit of the cumulus, broken into fragments, recedes into the sky, which is peopled in its serenity with quiet multitudes of the white, soft, silent cirrus; and under these again, drift near the zenith, disturbed and impatient shadows of a darker spirit, seeking rest and finding none.|$|R
