From the functional perspective they {{can be seen as}} components of certain lexicogrammatical patterns used to compose a text. Therefore this specific functional <b>noun</b> group is identified on the junction between lexis and grammar. These <b>nouns</b> have not been detected by Lithuanian linguists, but they have been identified and analyzed in the English langauge. <b>Nouns</b> such as aim, fact, problem, thing, etc. are given different names by different linguists: container <b>nouns,</b> general <b>nouns,</b> unspecific <b>nouns,</b> anaphoric <b>nouns,</b> carrier <b>nouns,</b> shell <b>nouns,</b> signaling <b>nouns,</b> etc. Nevertheless, all of them share the same features.

40|$|Collocation {{learning}} {{has long been}} recognised as a problematic domain for even high-level learners and acknowledged to lag far behind acquisition of other SLA aspects. This thesis explores the role of vocabulary growth in the learning of L 2 collocations. It addresses the relationship between vocabulary increase and L 2 collocation learning, aiming to identify whether increasing lexemes in a syn(onym) set (Fellbaum, 1998) is the main factor responsible. A corpus-based cross-sectional study was undertaken on Chinese EFL learners’written production of three types of collocations: <b>verb</b> + <b>noun</b> collocations (the main research target), adjective + <b>noun</b> and <b>noun</b> + <b>noun</b> collocations. Lexical <b>verbs</b> in <b>verb</b> + <b>noun</b> collocations were classified into synsets and analyses were performed on collocations within these synsets. It finds a lag in L 2 learners’verb + <b>noun</b> collocational knowledge with rising proficiency. This lag in collocational knowledge {{was found to be}} associated with an increase in lexical verbs learnt at higher levels. Collocation errors were seldom made where there was no increase in verb synsets. However, for synsets in which there was a verb increase, collocation errors involving new verbs were significantly more likely than errors with old verbs. The occurrence of collocation errors became increasingly limited to synsets with a verb increase as learners proceeded to more advanced levels. An alternative explanation was attempted to see if newly acquired <b>nouns</b> were also a factor responsible for the collocation lag. Results showed that in the majority of new <b>nouns</b> produced by higher levels of learners, collocations were target-like, and the percentages of new <b>nouns</b> in erroneous <b>verb</b> + <b>noun</b> collocations remained constant at both higher levels. In contrast, it finds an improvement in L 2 learners’knowledge of adjective + <b>noun</b> and <b>noun</b> + <b>noun</b> collocations. The thesis attempted to account for such differing performance from the perspective of vocabulary growth within synsets. The decreasing synonym density of <b>verbs,</b> adjectives and <b>nouns</b> may account for the relatively poorer performance on <b>verb</b> + <b>noun</b> collocations, and better performance on adjective + <b>noun</b> and <b>noun</b> + <b>noun</b> collocations. These findings are discussed with a view to a clearer understanding of the process of second language collocation learning, and to pedagogical implications...|$|R
50|$|Tuvaluan {{tends to}} favour using <b>verbs</b> over <b>nouns.</b> <b>Nouns</b> can be formed from many verbs {{by adding the}} suffix -ga.

Generally, verbs can be identified by the tense marker which precedes them (usually immediately, but occasionally separated by adverbs). Verbs do not change form because of tense, and only occasionally undergo gemination in the plural. Passive and reciprocal verbs undergo some changes by the use of affixes, but these forms are used infrequently and usually apply to loan words from Samoan.|$|R

The main concern {{of this study is}} the morphological component of JDLA though a general overview of the phonological system along with major phonological processes have been presented and accounted for. Such a presentation of the phonological processes is justified by the fact that phonology and morphology do interplay greatly in many points in the grammar. This dissertation is the first study of JDLA. The presentation of this dissertation is conducted in the following way. Chapter I is an introduction. Chapter II deals in brief with the phonological system of the dialect. This includes the consonants and vowels, syllable structure, stress rules and the major phonological processes of JDLA. Phonological processes include syncope, epenthesis, assimilation, metathesis, vowel length, vowel harmony, etc. Chapter III introduces the morphology of verbs where the derivation and inflection of triliteral and quadriliteral verbs are presented in detail. This includes the derivational and inflectional processes of sound, doubled, hollow and defective verbs [...] . etc. JDLA morphology is a root-based morphology where different morphological categories are produced through the interdigitation of roots and vowels which might be accompanied by affixes. Such a process is a very productive method in word creation as has been pointed out in the main body of this work. Chapter IV is devoted to the morphology of <b>nouns.</b> The derivation and inflection of verbal <b>nouns,</b> instance <b>nouns,</b> unit <b>nouns,</b> feminine <b>nouns,</b> instrumental <b>nouns,</b> locative <b>nouns,</b> etc. are elaborated upon.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Saudi dialects such as Hijazi Arabic (henceforth HA) and Najdi Arabic (henceforth NA) {{have been}} studied for centuries. However, other lesser-known Saudi dialects have not been studied yet. Zahrani Spoken Arabic (henceforth ZSA) is a dialect from the {{southern}} region of Saudi Arabia, with around 35, 000 speakers, {{which has not been}} described or analyzed. Due to migration and the loss of speakers across generations, it is now an endangered language. This thesis presents an analysis of the ZSA dialect, including a brief description of its history, speakers, and location. It is organized into eight chapters focusing on three main areas: phonology, morphology, and syntax. The phonological description provides information on consonants and vowels, syllable structure, word stress, and the main phonological processes in ZSA. As discussed in Chapter Three, verbs in ZSA are formed from two main types of root—triliteral and quadriliteral. Within these groups, there are six different classes of triliteral root: sound roots, double roots, hamzated (glottalized) roots, assimilated roots, hollow roots, and defective roots; and another three distinct classes are formed from the quadriliteral roots: sound roots, weak roots, and reduplicated roots. These different classes can be seen to form up to ten derivational forms. This chapter also deals with the inflectional forms of verbs, including subject-verb agreement, tense, aspect, mood, and voice. The discussion of nominal morphology covers both derivational and inflectional processes. It shows that ZSA has two main types of noun: these are derived <b>nouns,</b> which include verbal <b>nouns</b> and verbal derivatives, and non-derived <b>nouns,</b> which include proper <b>nouns</b> and borrowed <b>nouns.</b> Additionally, there are certain types of derived <b>nouns</b> that are named according to their meanings after the derivational processes have taken place. These are: unit <b>nouns,</b> instant <b>nouns,</b> <b>nouns</b> of place, occupational <b>nouns,</b> instrumental <b>nouns,</b> diminutive <b>nouns,</b> and common <b>nouns.</b> Adjectives in ZSA vary according to the derivational processes involved. They are derived from lexical roots or other parts of speech such as verbs. Some adjectives are derived from <b>nouns</b> by attaching nisbah suffixes. This thesis also provides a basic description of phrase structure in ZSA, including <b>noun</b> phrases, adjective phrases, prepositional phrases, and verb phrases. Following on from this discussion, other related issues such as word order and agreement are dealt with. Lastly, it provides a basic description of verbal and equational clauses in ZSA, including word order and agreement. A brief description of negation in both verbal and equational clauses is given, and the structure of interrogatives is also discussed...|$|R

Some of the problems with the FORmula TRANslation era are that 1) for non-technical and technical people alike, programs written in mathematical notation are hard to understand; 2) it is not particularly applicable to non-numerical applications such as bioinformatics and data bases; 3) it depends on pointers for efficient execution limiting hardware designs; 4) it is inherently sequential and handles data parallel, parallel to scalar extraction and scalar to parallel broadcasting computation poorly and 5) it can not be easily verbalized, requiring auxiliary equipment such as keyboards and mice for input, limiting its use. This paper describes how some of the features of natural language prose, such as <b>verbs,</b> <b>nouns,</b> pronouns, <b>noun</b> phrases, and prepositional phrases can be used for programming. This model is suitable for all types of computers, but is especially appropriate for SIMD multicore chips. A brief introduction to Plain English using the Minimal Spanning Tree algorithm is included...|$|R
