To allow the construction of hybrid systems, where the 4-20 mA is generated by the controller, but {{enables the use of}} pneumatic valves, a range of current to pressure (I to P) converters are available from manufacturers.

After treatment or processing, valves are opened to allow the product to drain and vessels may receive the next batch. However, with conventional valves {{there will always be}} an amount of fluid trapped between the <b>valve</b> closing <b>element</b> and the tank or vessel, especially for those which are jacketed to allow heating or cooling. This amount is usually untreated, that is to say has not undergone the changes or processing taking place on the fluid bulk in the vessel.

In order to utilize the natural forisome elements in a technical chip application, we integrated the protein complexes into the channel system of a microflow cell. In this artificial environment, the reversible conformation change of the forisomes could be induced by varying the calcium concentration or by an electrically generated pH shift. In consequence, the swelling of the forisome reversibly blocked a microparticle flow in various branched and unbranched channel geometries. The regulation of the flow was successfully verified by detecting the particle flux while switching the valve and by impedance spectroscopy.

30|$|Importantly, a {{permanent}} readout {{of the current}} status of active microfluidic elements is highly demanded since this will serve as an interface with current electronic semiconductor technologies {{and at the same time}} will enable the collection of information about the dynamics and kinetics of chemical processes [18]. One possible way to interface electronics with the microfluidic domain is given by the implementation of an optical detection system directly in the microfluidic channel. Due to their unique electrochemical or optoelectronic properties, nanoparticles (NPs) made of metallic [19, 20] or semiconductive [21] materials are often applied for sensing application in microfluidic systems. However, many of these NP based systems suffer from leaching and instability of the NPs. In this regard, the chemical immobilization of NPs on surfaces or in porous matrices is a known alternative to overcome these problems [22 – 24]. In case of soft-matter, active material components, especially hydrogels, it is obvious to use these as host matrix for NPs. The polymers facilitate compatibility with the NPs, a stable immobilization and provide desired optical properties. These requirements are mandatory for a suitable on-chip sensor. Many examples of these hybrid materials were reported to date [24 – 33] prepared by different coupling methods such as grafting the polymer to the NP ligand shell [26, 27, 33] or capping the NP by the polymer [31, 32, 34]. Apart from these hybrid materials, optically active quantum dots (QDs) can be considered as a promising material for the functionalization of the hydrogels, as the optical readout signal (which is the strong and photostable emission of QDs), is extremely sensitive to pH changes [35, 36]. Hence, QDs are applied as pH sensors and have been used in the development of bio- and ratiometric sensing platforms [37 – 41]. However, none of the realized sensing approaches show {{a permanent}}ly immobilization of QDs in a microfluidic chip system. In the study at hand, we developed a new hybrid material that consists of pH sensitive, fluorescent QDs made of glutathione (Glu) capped cadmium telluride (CdTe) which are immobilized by covalent attachment in a polyelectrolyte PA hydrogel. The QDs based hybrid system was further integrated in microfluidic chips in order to demonstrate a successful combination of an optical pH sensor and an active <b>valve</b> <b>element.</b>|$|E
40|$|Tutorialpg. 211 In {{order to}} ensure safe, reliable, {{efficient}} and cost effective operation of reciprocating pumps, pump dynamics should not be ignored. Pump problems due to dynamics are often difficult to diagnose and solve. Dynamic problems usually lie {{in one or more}} of the following areas: *Pulsation control (piping acoustics) *Vibration control (piping mechanics) *Cavitation control (pulsation and pressure drop) *Pump valve dynamics (valve motion). All the areas can be interactive to such an extent that it is difficult to know where the most effective changes can be made. A clear summary of each area will be presented with a view towards understanding how these areas can interact. The topic will be approached from an engineering perception viewpoint (a spectral energy response overlay) with minimal emphasis on mathematical concepts. Following the energy as it transfers though the whole system reveals how inefficient energy transfer and local energy magnification (resonance) is key to understanding how to prevent or solve everyday problems. Problems such as vibration, bladder failure, valve failure, poor performance, fatigue failure, and safety concerns are usually linked to one or more dynamic areas. Along with a basic understanding of the physics involved in pump dynamic areas, it is also helpful to have a working knowledge of ?rule of thumb? techniques that can be reliable and extremely cost effective. Pulsation control will be viewed using mechanical analogies with cause and effect scenarios. Vibration control will be focused on reducing the shaking force through reducing acoustic-to-mechanical coupling mechanisms, instead of brute force mechanical modifications. Cavitation and NPSHR (the inlet pressure required to prevent cavitation) problems will be viewed from a simple understanding of local instantaneous pressure compared to vapor pressure. Valve dynamics will be viewed in terms of simple fluid pressure forces, as they are exerted on a pressure controlled <b>valve</b> <b>element.</b> This engineering perception has a firm theoretical foundation but requires only fundamental mathematics to employ. Two short case histories will be presented illustrating pulsation/vibration control, cavitation control and pump valve problems. In almost all cases, piping vibration is the result of pulsation coupling into mechanical shaking forces yielding vibration with possible fatigue failures. Pump manifolds and external piping can be modified to ensure nonresonant acoustic systems that greatly reduce vibrational force. Once the shaking force is reduced, it remains to ensure that mechanical resonance is not present. Although cavitation is generally thought to be pressure drop related, in many cases it can be traced to acoustical resonances associated with the pump manifold and connected piping. Pump valve problems are generally solved through increasing spring stiffness, decreasing lift and employing more rugged materials. The use of newly developed materials has had the tendency of appearing as a universal fix where high pulsation levels can be tolerated. The best solution for many valve problems is reducing the pulsations that induce excessive impact forces. The use of a spectral energy response overlay or window is a concept that is in use by many who deal with dynamic problems. This type of approach is easily understood, but not as rigorous as the actual model approach. It should become apparent that most design quality can be determined by the overlay approach. It is not intended to replace the full model, but it will produce a good initial starting design and form the basis for analyzing existing field problems...|$|E

This project combines human operator control with robotic control concepts to create a hybrid control architecture, in which the strengths of each control method are combined to increase machine efficiency and reduce operator fatigue. The kinematics reconfiguration type differential control of the excavator implemented with a variety of ''software machine kinematics'' is the key feature of the project. This software re-configured excavator is more desirable to execute a given digging task. The human operator retains the master control of the main motion parameters, while the computer coordinates the repetitive movement patterns of the machine links. These repetitive movements may be selected from a pre-defined family of trajectories with different transformations.

40|$|A {{proposed}} valve {{for controlling}} {{the rate of}} flow of a fluid would include an electric-motor-driven ball-screw mechanism for adjusting the seating element of the valve to any position between fully closed and fully open. The motor would be of a type that can be electronically controlled to rotate to a specified angular position and to rotate at a specified rate, and the ball screw would enable accurate linear positioning of the seating element {{as a function of}} angular position of the motor. Hence, the proposed valve would enable fine electronic control of the rate of flow and the rate of change of flow. The uniqueness of this valve lies in a high degree of integration of the actuation mechanism with the flow-control components into a single, relatively compact unit. A notable feature of this integration is that {{in addition to being a}} major part of the actuation mechanism, the ball screw would also be a flow-control component: the ball screw would be hollow so as to contain part of the main flow passage, and one end of the ball screw would be the main seating <b>valve</b> <b>element.</b> The relationships among the components of the valve are best understood by reference to the figure, which presents meridional cross sections of the valve in the fully closed and fully open positions. The motor would be supported by a bracket bolted to the valve body. By means of gears or pulleys and a timing belt, motor drive would be transmitted to a sleeve that would rotate on bearings in the valve body. A ball nut inside the sleeve would be made to rotate with the sleeve by use of a key. The ball screw would pass through and engage the ball nut. A key would prevent rotation of the ball screw in the valve body while allowing the ball screw to translate axially when driven by the ball nut. The outer surface of the ball screw would be threaded only in a mid-length region: the end regions of the outer surface of the ball screw would be polished so that they could act as dynamic sealing surfaces. The inlet end (the right end as depicted in the figure) of the ball screw would be the main seating valve element: in the fully closed position, it would be pressed against the valve seat, as depicted in the upper part of the figure. A retainer would hold the valve seat in an inlet fitting. In addition, the retainer would be contoured to obtain a specified flow rate as a function of axial position of the ball screw. In the fully closed position, little force would be needed to press the ball screw against the seat because the push bore area upon which the upstream pressure would act would be small. The motor would position and hold the ball screw against the seat, providing the force necessary for sealing. To open the valve to a particular position, the motor would be commanded to rotate to a particular angular position (equivalently, a particular number of revolutions) at a particular rate of rotation within its torque limitations. Once the valve was open, fluid would flow through the inlet fitting and the chamber in the inlet housing, past the seat and its retainer, along the hollow core of the ball screw, and through the outlet housing and outlet fitting. The net force generated from fluid pressure in the open position would be small because the pressure exposed to the push bore areas at the inlet and outlet are nearly equal and the forces generated would be in opposing directions...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. 2016. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisors: Perry Li, Thomas Chase. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); 331 pages. Hydraulic systems offer {{a range of}} benefits, such as high power density, ruggedness, linear actuation, and low cost, which {{have led to the}} use of hydraulic actuation systems throughout a wide range of industries. However, they also typically suffer from lower efficiency than competing methods of actuation, which limits their appeal in some applications, and presents a threat to their continued prevalence as energy efficiency becomes increasingly important. The relatively low efficiency of hydraulic systems {{is due in part to}} inefficient components, such as pumps and motors, and partially due to the typical method of control, which uses throttling valves to place restrictions in the flow path to dissipate excess power as heat. Several approaches to reducing throttling losses have been studied, such as using pumps, motors, or transformers to control individual actuators, or creating circuits with multiple pressure levels to reduce the pressure drop across individual valves. However, these approaches often suffer from high cost and size requirements, or experience reduced control performance, which can limit their appeal. An alternative approach is to use high-speed on/off valves to charge and discharge energy storage elements to transform the power flow rather than restricting it. Different configurations of switching hydraulic circuits can be used to create variable pumps, motors, actuators, or transformers. This approach can significantly reduce the power loss that is typically associated with controlling hydraulic systems using conventional valves. However, control using high speed switching valves presents several challenges. The most significant drawback is the power ripple that results from the discontinuous nature of the control valves. While this can be mitigated using energy storage elements, such as inertias and accumulators, it cannot be completely eliminated. Furthermore, there is a fundamental trade-off between the degree of smoothing and the speed of response of the system. In chapter 2 the system dynamics of a switching system are studied in the context of a specific switching circuit, the Virtually Variable Displacement Pump (VVDP), and it is demonstrated that the trade-off between ripple and response time can be improved by increasing the Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) frequency and through the use of feedback control. An example of the VVDP circuit, which uses an on/off valve to load and unload a fixed displacement pump with an accumulator to smooth the output flow, is shown experimentally to improve the efficiency of the control system by up to 43 % over a throttling valve system when operating at 2. 5 Hz. However, this efficiency benefit is reduced to 24 % when the switching frequency is increased to 10 Hz. This highlights another challenge with designing switching circuits: the power loss mechanisms that occur in on/off valve controlled systems, particularly transition throttling and compressibility losses which occur every switch, can reduce the potential efficiency benefits and must be taken into account as PWM frequencies are increased. The throttling loss that occurs as the valve transitions between states is often the largest source of power loss in on/off valve systems operating at moderate to high PWM frequencies. The long transition time of many conventional switching valves places an upper limit on the PWM frequencies that can be achieved while still providing an efficiency benefit. To reduce the effect of the transition loss, the concept of hydraulic soft switching is introduced in chapter 3 which, in simulation, reduced the transition loss by 81 %. This technique, which mimics a concept from switching electrical converters, provides temporary flow paths for the hydraulic fluid to bypass the transitioning on/off valve, thus avoiding most of the transition throttling. Another power loss that must be considered, particularly at high PWM frequencies, is the power needed to actuate the on/off valve. While increasing the PWM frequency can be effective at reducing the output ripple and the size of the energy storage elements, the energy needed to accelerate the switching elements in conventional on/off valves at high PWM frequencies is not insignificant. If the kinetic energy of the switching element is not re-captured, the power needed to actuate the valve increases with the PWM frequency cubed. To address this problem, a novel type of rotary valve that spins at a constant speed is presented in chapter 4. This rotary valve achieves high PWM frequencies by alternately connecting a fixed port in the housing to supply or tank as the spool rotates. The duty ratio, which describes the fraction of the rotation that the valve is “on,” is adjusted by moving the valve spool axially. The fact that the valve rotates with a constant speed eliminates the need to accelerate the <b>valve</b> <b>element,</b> meaning the valve must only overcome viscous friction. This has the potential to enable much higher switching speeds than conventional valves. However, with this novel valve architecture, there are a number of design trade-offs that must be negotiated. In chapter 4, the design of the rotary valve, in the context of both a VVDP and a Virtually Variable Displacement Pump/Motor (VVDPM), is formulated as a constrained power loss minimization problem to determine the optimal design parameters. For the VVDPM, this optimization is done for a device that is operating as the wheel motor in a Hydraulic Hybrid Passenger Vehicle. In addition to losses due to throttling across control valves, hydraulic system efficiency is degraded by power losses within hydraulic components, such as pumps and motors. The majority of these losses stem from leakage and friction caused by high pressure applied to elements that move relative to each other. In conventional piston type devices, which are common in the hydraulics industry, the displacement of the unit, and thus its power output, is varied by changing the stroke length of the pistons as they are rotated. This method maintains high pressure on the same number of pistons, regardless of the power output, resulting in leakage and friction losses that do not decrease with the power output and a sharp drop in efficiency at low displacements. In order to address this problem, a different form of on/off control can be used: direct control of individual pistons in a pump/motor. Using this method, pressure is removed from pistons to reduce the pump/motor displacement, which allows the power losses in the system to decrease with displacement. In chapter 5, the power loss mechanisms in both a conventional and discrete piston device are compared, and the potential efficiency benefit is highlighted. One challenge with creating discrete piston controlled pump/motors is designing the control valves to operate quickly and efficiently enough to provide effective control of the pressure in the piston chambers. Designs have been proposed that use two fast-acting electrohydraulic valves to connect the piston to supply or tank. This approach provides flexibility in selecting the disabling strategy and valve timing, but it also leads to designs that are expensive and complicated to control. The requirements for a discrete piston control valve are that it must switch quickly, especially as the pump/motor shaft speed increases, require little actuation power, and have repeatable timing with respect to the pump/motor shaft position. These characteristics match well with the two degree of freedom rotary valve described in chapter 4. In chapter 6 several valve designs based on the rotary valve concept are proposed, and a mechanism using the rotary valve as a pilot stage driving three-way spool valves is selected, analyzed, and designed as a part of a discrete piston controlled pump/motor. The detailed design of a discrete piston prototype, which uses hydro-mechanical rather than electrohydraulic control valves is described, and experimental results are presented in chapter 7. While high internal leakage caused by manufacturing challenges limited the experimentally demonstrated efficiency, estimates of the power loss without the internal leakage, analytical equations, and simulation results demonstrate the potential of the discrete piston control approach. Whether they are used to create switching circuits that avoid the losses associated with conventional throttling valves, or if they are used to reduce the leakage and friction losses in a discrete piston controlled pump motor, on/off valves can be used to improve the efficiency of hydraulic control systems. However, the design of switching valve controlled systems is not without challenges, and this thesis examines many of the potential benefits, as well as difficulties in creating efficient and effective solutions using on/off valves...|$|E

A local 'hysteresis loop' technique has been invented to study the abrupt switching behavior of individual elements.

30|$|To {{compare the}} effect of {{reinforcement}} fiber volume fraction and orientation on the closing of a tubular heart <b>valve,</b> the finite <b>element</b> (FE) model was created and utilized. First, {{the ability of the}} model to converge with decreasing mesh size was investigated for the heart valve model without textile reinforcement. Finally, the fiber volume fraction and fiber reinforcement orientation was investigated to show how the fiber reinforcement can be tailored to decrease maximum strain or change valve shape under pressure.|$|R

Major changes in the technical state of the valve components under dynamic operating loads were revealed using the results of resource tests of two-position valves with polarized electromagnetic actuator. An effective way for reducing the dynamic loads {{has proved to be}} the introduction of the damping element into the kinematic scheme of the electromagnetic <b>valve</b> actuator. Damping <b>elements</b> efficiency in reducing dynamic loads has been confirmed experimentally...|$|R
50|$|MPC models {{predict the}} change in the {{dependent}} variables of the modeled system that will be caused by changes in the independent variables. In a chemical process, independent variables that can be adjusted by the controller are often either the setpoints of regulatory PID controllers (pressure, flow, temperature, etc.) or the final control <b>element</b> (<b>valves,</b> dampers, etc.). Independent variables that cannot be adjusted by the controller are used as disturbances. Dependent variables in these processes are other measurements that represent either control objectives or process constraints.|$|R
40|$|Nine young {{patients}} with normally functioning bi-leaflet mechanical prosthetic heart valves in the mitral or aortic positions were studied with digital phonocardiography and a signal processing technique known as digital deconvolution analysis. This analysis determines the temporal sequence of impacts {{produced by the}} <b>valve's</b> occluding <b>element(s)</b> striking the <b>valve</b> cage and characterizes the acoustic response to normal asynchronous impacting forces. Phonocardiographic signals were recorded with a high frequency accelerometer transducer and digitized at 8000 samples/s. Beat-to-beat variability in asynchrony of leaflet closure occurred with a difference of 0 - 9 msec between closure times of the two valve leaflets. Individual mean asynchrony values ranged from 1. 9 - 5. 8 msec, probably related to changing contours of initial reversing blood flow capturing each leaflet separately. Digital deconvolution analysis characterizes dynamic and structural properties of mechanical prosthetic heart valves and provides a simple noninvasive method for serial assessment of the valve's function...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a piezoelectric-hydraulic pump with {{innovative}} active valves is presented in this study. The pump structure consists of a piezoelectric stack actuator and two piezoelectric unimorph disc valves acting as inlet and delivery valves. The pump actuation mechanism is composed of a pumping chamber and a diaphragm attached to the piezoelectric stack actuator. Static and dynamic piezoelectric finite element analyses {{have been used to}} maximize the delivered fluid volume per stroke and to predict the dynamic behavior, respectively. A structural optimization technique has been employed to optimize the pump’s efficiency for specific geometrical dimensions. A transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been utilized to predict flow rates.
