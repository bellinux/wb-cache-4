50|$|In {{another case}} {{reported}} in 2013, a 48-year-old female patient reported 4 days of mild dyspnea, dry cough, bilateral popliteal fossae pain and diffuse upper abdominal pain. She had {{no history of}} liver disease or alcohol or illicit substance abuse. Initial physical examination was remarkable only for mildly pale conjunctivae and mild abdominal tenderness and pain in the left popliteal fossa. A complete blood count and complete metabolic panel were normal. Prothrombin time (PT) was above 100 s, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was above 200 s and international normalized ratio (INR) was reported as above 12.0. Urinalysis revealed hematuria. <b>Venous</b> <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound of lower extremities demonstrated left popliteal vein thrombosis. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen demonstrated transmural hematoma, and fecal occult blood test was positive. A full anticoagulant work-up showed critical reduction of vitamin K-dependent factors II, VII, IX and X. PT and PTT corrected with mixing studies proving factor deficiency {{as the cause of}} the coagulopathy. Lupus anticoagulant studies were negative. Superwarfarin toxicity was suspected and confirmed with an anticoagulant poison panel positive for brodifacoum. The patient was hospitalized and successfully treated with fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate and vitamin K. In conclusion, paradoxical thrombosis and hemorrhage should raise the suspicion for superwarfarin toxicity in the appropriate clinical setting. It was concluded that concomitant presentation for thrombosis and hemorhhage with remarkably abnormal PT and PTT should raise the suspicion for brodifacoum poisoning.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{analyze the}} {{usefulness}} of transvaginal color Doppler assessment of venous flow in the differential diagnosis of adnexal masses. Material and Methods Ninety-one consecutive patients (mean age: 46. 6 years, range: 16 – 81 years) diagnosed as having an adnexal mass were evaluated by transvaginal color Doppler sonography prior to surgery. Color Doppler was used to detect and analyze the flow velocity waveform from arterial and venous blood flow within the tumor. For arterial signals the resistance index and peak systolic velocity, and for veins the maximum venous flow velocity, were calculated. Receiver operator characteristic curves were plotted {{to determine the best}} venous flow velocity cut-off. According to our previous study using arterial Doppler, a tumor was considered as malignant when flow was detected and the lowest resistance index was ≤ 0. 45. Using <b>venous</b> <b>Doppler</b> a mass was considered as malignant when flow was detected and the venous flow velocity was ≥ the best cut-off found on the receiver operator characteristic curve. Definitive histopathological diagnosis was obtained in all cases. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for B-mode morphology (evaluation performed according to Sassone’s scoring system), arterial Doppler, <b>venous</b> <b>Doppler,</b> and a combination of both arterial and <b>venous</b> <b>Doppler</b> were calculated. Results Twenty-five masses (27. 5 %) were malignant and 66 (72. 5 %) benign. Arterial and venous flow was found more frequently in malignant than in benign masses (92 % vs. 41 % (P < 0. 001) and 72 % vs. 21 % (P < 0. 001), respectively). The resistance index was significantly lower in malignant tumors (0. 42 vs. 0. 60, P = 0. 0003). No differences were found in peak systolic velocity. Venous flow velocity was significantly higher in malignant masses (18. 1 cm/s vs. 8. 9 cm/s, P = 0. 0006). The best cut-off of venous flow velocity was 10 cm/s. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for morphology, arterial Doppler, <b>venous</b> <b>Doppler,</b> and the combination of both arterial and <b>venous</b> <b>Doppler</b> were 92 %, 71 %, 45 %, 96 %; 76 %, 95 %, 87 %, 91 %; 68 %, 94 %, 81 %, 89 %; and 88 %, 91 %, 79 %, 95 %, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the hepatic <b>venous</b> <b>Doppler</b> technique {{in the diagnosis}} of premature heart beats in prenatals. Furthermore, to estimate the prevalence and persistency of atrial and ventricular extra beats throughout pregnancy and delivery, and explore the coexistence of congenital heart disease. METHODS: Retrospective study of 256 singleton pregnancies on out-patient attendance due to fetal extra beats. Hepatic <b>venous</b> <b>Doppler</b> and detailed fetal echocardiography were performed. Fetal heart rate patterns during labor and neonatal conditions were collected. Congenital heart malformations and the frequency and persistence of fetal extrasystole were noted. RESULTS: 228 (89 %) showed signs of supraventricular extrasystole (SVES) and 19 (11 %) had ventricular extrasystole (VES). One fetus with SVES developed atrial flutter during pregnancy and another supraventricular tachycardia postnatally. SVES persisted in 28 fetuses until labor and delivery (12. 3 %) and in 6 with VES (21. 4 %). In 31 of 34 having extra beats during labor and delivery, the conduction pattern normalized within three days (91. 2 %). Five neonates were referred for evaluation by a pediatric cardiologist. Two cases had congenital heart disease. Extra beats persisted until labor and delivery more frequently in male fetuses (p< 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic <b>venous</b> <b>Doppler</b> can differentiate between SVES and VES. Although more uncommon, VES tends to persist throughout pregnancy more often than SVES. In spite of this, the results strongly support a benign development with only two cases developing tachycardia and two (0. 78 %) having a coexisting congenital heart malformation.

Aim of our study was to establish the prognostic impact of LV diastolic function as assessed by Transmitral flow and Pulmonary Venous Flow (PVF) transesophageal Doppler recording in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DC). Methods. One hundred and twenty two patients affected by DC with different etiologies were consecutively enrolled in 1995. They were all on optimized therapy. They underwent a TEE Doppler study. Thus PVF was evaluated with the most reliable approach. The following parameters were measured: peak systolic and diastolic PV wave ratio (S/D), E and A mitral wave ratio (E/A), mitral E deceleration time (EDT) and the time difference between PV atrial reversal (Ar) and mitral A wave duration (A).

40|$|Objectives. This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine whether intravenous injection of a sonicated albumin echocardiographic contrast agent (Albunex) improved {{the quality of the}} transthoracic pulmonary venous flow Doppler signal. Background. Previous studies have shown that transesophageal echocardiography provides pulmonary venous flow Doppler signals superior in quality to those seen with transthoracic echocardiography, which are of limited quality in up to 25 % of patients. Methods. Twenty-one patients underwent transthoracic pulsed wave Doppler examination of pulmonary venous flow before, during and after two doses of Albunex ranging from 0. 08 ml/kg (low dose) to 0. 22 ml/kg (high dose). In addition, five patients underwent transesophageal examination of pulmonary venous flow before and after a 0. 08 -ml/kg dose of Albunex. The efficacy of the contrast injection was determined using a score that graded the quality of the three components of the pulmonary <b>venous</b> <b>Doppler</b> signal from 0 to 3 (0 = no visible signal; 3 = optimal signal). Results. Albunex enhanced the quality of the pulmonary <b>venous</b> <b>Doppler</b> signal from baseline (score 3. 9 ± 1. 8 [mean ±SD]) and at both low (score 5. 1 ± 2. 2, p < 0. 05) and high doses (score 5. 6 ± 2, p < 0. 001). Transthoracic pulmonary venous flow velocities were increased, and peak flow velocity ratios were unchanged, after injection of contrast agent. The contrast-enhanced variables showed good agreement with transesophageal flow velocities. Conclusions. Albunex improves the quality of the transthoracic pulmonary <b>venous</b> <b>Doppler</b> signal, thus allowing improved accuracy of measurement.

Patients and methods: Twenty-two BD patients (20 males and 2 females) {{with a mean age of}} 36. 9  ±  10. 6  years and disease duration of 10. 8  ±  11. 3  years without any known vascular disease and 22 age and sex matched controls were enrolled in this study. The Behçet’s disease current activity form (BDCAF) was used to assess disease activity. Patients and controls were subjected to <b>venous</b> <b>Doppler</b> US for both upper and lower limbs as well as the inferior vena cavae (IVC). The Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) severity score was used to evaluate the severity of venous insufficiency. Results: The 22 patients had a mean BDCAF score of 2. 2  ±  0. 2. No venous thrombosis or thrombophlebitis was detected in patients or controls. Three patient (13. 6 %) and one control (4. 5 %) revealed venous-insufficiency (venous reflux > 1  s) in the lower extremities. The venous-insufficiency involved the superficial venous system and involved the deep venous system in 1 patients and the control. The lower limb veins were normal on both sides as regards compressibility, wall thickness and competency of perforator veins. Upper extremity veins were totally normal in all subjects.

We reviewed our subsequent experience using fetal pulmonary <b>venous</b> <b>Doppler</b> patterns to identify and manage fetuses with critical left heart obstruction and suspected restrictive atrial septum. MethodsA retrospective review of neonates with a prenatal diagnosis of critical left heart obstruction was performed. Fetal restrictive atrial septum was defined as a small/absent interatrial shunt on 2 -dimensional imaging and a mean forward/reverse time-velocity integral ratio of 5 or less. Available serial pulmonary <b>venous</b> <b>Doppler</b> data were reviewed. The primary outcome was postnatal confirmation of restrictive atrial septum or severe left atrial hypertension. ResultsEight of 39 infants had a forward/reverse time-velocity integral ratio of 5 or less. A restrictive atrial septum was confirmed postnatally in 6 of 8 infants. Overall, a forward/reverse time-velocity integral ratio of 5 or less had a sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 94 % for emergency atrial septostomy. Lowering the cutoff value to 3 or less would have eliminated false-positive diagnoses in the current series. Serial data demonstrated that late second trimester values did not change in later gestation with respect to either threshold in 30 of 32 fetuses. ConclusionsIn the fetus with critical left heart obstruction, a threshold forward/reverse time-velocity integral ratio of 3 or less optimizes specificity for predicting emergency atrial septostomy.

During investigation of the etiology of the varicose veins, radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging of the left leg were requested. These showed images suggestive of an osteolytic lesion in the tibia, but led us to the diagnosis of an intraosseous vein with anomalous drainage. This was confirmed through vascular examinations comprising <b>Doppler</b> <b>venous</b> flow measurement and phlebography. Recognition of this rare intraosseous anomaly is fundamental for proper patient management, but an intraosseous surgical approach is unnecessary...|$|R
40|$|Diagnosis of non cirrhotic portal {{fibrosis}} {{was considered}} when {{the following criteria}} were fulfilled evidence of portal hypertension (oesophageal varices, hypersplenism, ascites, or increased hepatic <b>venous</b> pressure gradient), <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound showing patent portal and hepatic veins, and liver biopsy showing sign of cirrhosis. Non cirrhotic portal fibrosis clinically characterized by splenomegaly, anemia, portal hypertension, and histopathological examination portal tract showing fibrosis and sclerosis. Portal hypertension are most caused by a cirrhotic liver (85 %), {{there are only a}} few reports on non cirrhotic portal hypertension, mostly in Japan and India. We reported a case of non cirrhotic portal fibrosis in young male. The clinical complications of portal hypertension are variceal bleeding and pancytopenia due to hypersplenism. Variceal band ligation and splenectomy were performed. The patient showed good clinical response...|$|R
