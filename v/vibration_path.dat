Today noise and vibration generated {{inside and outside the}} vehicles are more important factors for customers than before. So far several researchers have focused on interior noise transfer path analysis and the results have been published in related papers but each method has its own limitations. In present work, the vibration transfer path analysis and <b>vibration</b> <b>path</b> ranking of a car interior have been performed. As interior vibration is a source of structural borne noise problem, thus, the results of this research can be used to present the structural borne noise state in a vehicle. The proposed method in this paper does not need to disassemble the powertrain from the chassis. The procedure shows a good ability of <b>vibration</b> <b>path</b> ranking in a vehicle and is an effective tool to diagnose the vibration problem inside the vehicle.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades there have been many {{advances}} in home construction and appliances that are placed in homes. An important advancement in home construction is the manufactured I-joist used in flooring. Appliances have been advanced through front load washing machines. A local company to Boise, iLevel Manufacturing, is one particular producer of engineered lumber, and has received many complaints due to front load washing machines located on the second story of residential buildings. These front load machines tend to vibrate more than ordinary machines, and although manufactured I-joist can support a vertical load better than sawed lumber, they do not have enough lateral stiffness to be able to resist these vibrations. The design team has met with iLevel to find a solution to this problem. Two paths were taken, one to solve problems in existing homes and the other to prevent this problem from occurring in future homes. In vibration analysis, there is a vibration source (the washing machine), a <b>vibration</b> <b>path</b> (the washing machine feet and the floor), and a vibration responder (the home and everything contained within it). To address problems in existing homes, the <b>vibration</b> <b>path</b> was addressed. The design team has developed a concept of vibration isolating pads that will be placed under each corner of the washing machine to isolate the vibrations before they reach the responder. The vibrations have been analyzed through a series of mathematical models in order to select the appropriate isolation pad. For future home construction, the vibration responder was addressed. The design is to stiffen the floor through a series of joist blocking, smaller joist spacing, and heavier wood products. These models have both shown reduced transmitted vibrations through testing...|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{reports have}} {{indicated}} that some biological effects of relatively weak alternating magnetic fields depend upon the presence and magnitude of a parallel-directed static magnetic field. One explanation of these phenomena is parametric resonance mechanism, originally proposed by Lednev and also applied in modified form by Blackman and Blanchard. The mechanism, as formulated by Lednev, involves the Zeeman splitting of infrared vibration levels of Ca 2 + ions within proteins such as calmodulin. It is shown that this model can be formulated using mostly classical physics. In this formulation the linear <b>vibration</b> <b>path</b> of an oscillating ion is set into uniform rotation by the static magnetic field Bdc at an angular velocity equal to {{one half of the}} ion cyclotron resonance frequency Ω. Application of the alternating magnetic field Bac = B 1 cos bt will make the angular velocity non-uniform. Rather than relying on transition between vibration levels, and thus implicitly on energy changes due to radiation, as in the original model, we propose that the non-uniform rotation will lead to time-varying changes in the electrostatic component of the binding forces between the ion and the surrounding ligands. The angular displacement Δ 2 ̆ 6 phis; between “stagnation points”, where the angular velocity of the <b>vibration</b> <b>path</b> is zero, is computed for applied angular frequencies, b = Ω, Ω/ 2 and 2 Ω at specified ratios α = (B 1 /B 0). The selected values of α are those where the Lednev model predicts maximum biological effects. The values of Δ 2 ̆ 6 phis; are discussed in relation to published quantitative information about the structure of Ca 2 + binding sites within calmodulin. The double blind Jurkat cell experiments, conducted with B dc = [. 707,. 639,. 566,. 467,. 231,. 132,. 059] Gauss and Bac = [. 569,. 572,. 537,. 538,. 517] Gauss at fac = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] Hz, respectively, confirmed that our data were not inconsistent with the proposed mechanism. Based on our Jurkat data, when frequency index, n = ½, 1, 3 / 2, 2,… 6, we tested resonance of 65 bio-ions for (1) the verification of the mechanism and (2) the comparison between the Lednev model and the Blackman and Blanchard model. ...|$|E

These models should include the effects of the sources, receivers, supporting structure, sensors, and actuators. In this paper, a modeling technique which meets these requirements is developed and some active control strategies briefly investigated. The particular subject of investigation is an equipment loaded panel and the equations of motion are developed using the Lagrange-Rayleigh-Ritz (LRR) approach. The various pieces of equipment on the panel are mounted on active or passive suspensions, and resonators are used to represent the internal dynamics of the mounted equipment. Control of the panel, which transmits vibrations from sources to receivers, is by means of piezoelectric patches and the excitation consists of dynamic loads acting on the equipment encloseures and/or directly on the panel. The control objective is to minimize the displacement at an arbitrary output location. The LRR model developed is verified against one produced by an appropriate Finite Element Method. Finally, some initial controller design studies are undertaken to investigate and compare the effectiveness of different control strategies (eg minimization at the source, along the <b>vibration</b> <b>path,</b> or at the receiver) ...|$|E

The aim is to test practical solutions for helicopter interior noise reduction using active control techniques. Very annoying components of cabin noise are associated with gearbox meshing tones. A preliminary transmissibility analysis of the <b>vibration</b> <b>path</b> between the gearbox and the helicopter fuselage showed the predominant contribution of the longitudinal vibration. Thus the experiments were arranged and performed on a strut under longitudinal disturbance conditions. The strut was connected with two end masses to roughly reproduce terminal impedances and equipped {{with a pair of}} surface-bonded piezoelectric patches. The control algorithm was the feed-forward FXLMS. The primary excitation was generated on one end- mass by an electro-mechanical shaker aligned with the beam longitudinal axis. The analysis of the high voltage requirements of the control devices led to the implementation of a frequency-shaped FXLMS algorithm, by including a set of digital band-pass filters designed to concentrate the control action on a priori selected disturbing tones. A careful study has been conducted on the type of pass-band filters to ensure low delay response, high cutting properties, no ripple phenomenon and limited computational burden. Experimental results revealed the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Complete rejection of large amplitude narrow band disturbances was achieved with limited control effort...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{strength}} of new structural materials and longer spans of new footbridges, accompanied with aesthetic requirements for greater slenderness, are resulting in more lively footbridge structures. In {{the past few}} years this issue attracted great public attention. The excessive lateral sway motion caused by crowd walking across the infamous Millennium Bridge in London is the prime example of the vibration serviceability problem of footbridges. In principle, consideration of footbridge vibration serviceability requires a characterisation of the vibration source, path and receiver. This paper is the most comprehensive review published to date of about 200 references which deal with these three key issues. The literature survey identified humans as the most important source of vibration for footbridges. However, modelling of the crowd-induced dynamic force is not clearly defined yet, despite some serious attempts to tackle this issue in the last few years. The <b>vibration</b> <b>path</b> is the mass, damping and stiffness of the footbridge. Of these, damping is the most uncertain but extremely important parameter as the resonant behaviour tends to govern vibration serviceability of footbridges. A typical receiver of footbridge vibrations is a pedestrian who is quite often the source of vibrations as well. Many scales for rating the human perception of vibrations have been found in the published literature. However, few are applicable to footbridges because a receiver is not stationary but is actually moving across the vibrating structure. During footbridge vibration, especially under crowd load, it seems that some form of human–structure interaction occurs. The problem of influence of walking people on footbridge vibration properties, such as the natural frequency and damping is not well understood, let alone quantified. Finally, {{there is not a single}} national or international design guidance which covers all aspects of the problem comprehensively and some form of their combination with other published information is prudent when designing major footbridge structures. The overdue update of the current codes to reflect the recent research achievements is a great challenge for the next 5 – 10 years...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tools in clinical diagnostics. MRI scanners are associated by strong vibration which results in unpleasant and disturbing acoustic noise. The primary source of this vibration is the Lorentz force produced by fast switching of the currents inside the gradient coils of MRI scanners under a strong static magnetic field. During an MR-imaging scan the switching is controlled in order to spatially code the hydrogen nuclei that will generate the signal, which is reconstructed into anatomical images. Faster switching of the currents allows for shorter scan times and/or higher image resolutions. Consequently, the clinical quality has motivated the drive for shorter switching time and higher currents. This development, however, has also caused an undesired increase of MRI vibrations. The overall vibration phenomenon of an installed fully functional MRI scanner system becomes unique because of the installed location and ambiance. This vibration can potentially degrade the image quality and hence the diagnosis. Apart from the vibration produced, the associated annoying acoustic noise may not only affect the patients under examination and the clinical staff, but may also be transmitted to other parts of the building and causing discomfort for the personnel working there. In order to devise an effective isolation plan or improve an existing one both for vibration and acoustic noise it is important to study the noise and <b>vibration</b> transfer <b>paths.</b> This paper concerns an investigation of <b>vibration</b> transfer <b>paths</b> for <b>vibration</b> excited by an installed functional MRI scanner at a medical facility.

For damaged gears, these signatures relate {{to changes in}} dynamics due to the meshing of the damaged tooth. These signatures, referred to as condition indicators (CI), can perform differently when measured on different systems, such as a component test rig, or a full-scale transmission test stand, or an aircraft. These differences can result from dissimilarities in systems design and environment under dynamic operating conditions. The static structure can also filter the response between the vibration source and the accelerometer, when the accelerometer is installed on the housing. To assess the utility of static <b>vibration</b> transfer <b>paths</b> for predicting gear CI performance, measurements were taken on the NASA Glenn Spiral Bevel Gear Fatigue Test Rig.

HUMS analyze vibration signatures associated with faults and quantify them as condition indicators to predict component behavior. <b>Vibration</b> transfer <b>paths</b> are characterized by frequency response functions derived from the input/output relationship between applied force and dynamic response through a structure as a function of frequency. With an objective to investigate the differences in transfer paths, transfer path measurements were recorded under similar conditions in the left and right nose gearboxes of an AH- 64 helicopter and in an isolated left nose gearbox in a test fixture at NASA Glenn Research Center. The test fixture enabled the application of measured torques-common during an actual operation. An impact hammer as well as commercial and lab piezo shakers, were used in conjunction with two types of commercially available accelerometers to collect the vibration response under various test conditions. The frequency response functions measured under comparable conditions of both systems were found to be consistent. Measurements made on the fixture indicated certain real-world installation and maintenance issues, such as sensor alignments, accelerometer locations and installation torques, had minimal effect.

For instance, the ability to identify and quantify internal forces can greatly improve the estimation of parameters of a numerical model. In this paper, the identification of internal forces in a mechanical system has been investigated by {{the application of the}} Transfer Path Analysis (TPA) technique. TPA can be summarized as a test based approach which allows the analysis of the contribution of different <b>vibration</b> <b>paths</b> in a structure.

The aim is to estimate internal forces acting at the proximity of the bearings, under operating conditions, by the implementation of the TPA technique with the specific MI method. A Monte-Carlo simulation is also performed as a measure of the sensitivity of the method to errors in the experimental Frequency Response Function matrix. The internal forces are also directly measured by load cells installed at the specific locations, making this test rig an ideal tool for validation of the proposed technique.

This represents a drawback while optimizing the resilient mounting of large vibrating machinery where every knowledge of the dynamics of the <b>vibration</b> <b>paths</b> plays an important role. In the years, to improve isolation performance of the mounts, air springs, instead of the full rubber mounts, have been adopted. These consists of a rubber sleeve, with appropriate endings, filled up with air at the appropriate pressure. Again the manufacturers do not provide much of the information, the engineers would need to use those devices at their best. In this work the authors describe the testing machine that has been builded at the LVA to derive the force vs frequency vs pressure plots of a set of commercial air spring. The machine can measure the forces both above and below the device, allowing to determine, directly, in three directions, the transmissibility as function of the frequency and of the applied pressure. The preload acting on the spring, as well as the internal pressure, can also be modified allowing for a more accurate system description. The characteristics curves derived for the air-spring in such a way, will be used within a simple SDOF AVC system. The performances of this solution will be compared with the performance of an analogous system using only the commonly available static deflection value.

This technique is commonly applied on test measurements, based on prototypes, {{at the end of the}} design process. In order to apply such methodology already within the design process, a contribution analysis method based on dynamic substructuring of a multibody system is proposed with the aim of improving the quality of the design process for vehicle NVH assessment and to shorten development time and cost. The methodology here proposed is applied to assess vibrational contributions of an internal combustion engine without considering the corresponding Frequency Response Functions (FRF). Hence, the different excitations of the system (e. g. combustion, piston-liner interaction, bearing contact forces, etc.) are directly applied on the investigated geometry and their contributions are computed through numerical simulation.

Meanwhile, the potential applications of power flow in the TPA field are especially discussed. Secondly, focused on the OTPA method, an acoustic transfer path system by spherical radiation transfer path simulation system and a <b>vibration</b> transfer <b>path</b> experiment system by a rectangular plate vibrator excitation are designed considering {{the effects of the}} distance from reference points. The results show that the relative error between the OTPA values and the theoretical values as well as the experimental values is less than 5 % and 8 % respectively. At the same time, OTPA is sensitive to noise. When the noise is lower, the nearer reference points can improve the precision of OTPA method. Therefore, it is needed to arrange sensors and design operating conditions reasonably. Finally, the development trend of TPA method is presented...|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Sound and Vibration [© Elsevier] and the definitive version is available at: www. elsevier. com/locate/jsviPrevious research into structural <b>vibration</b> transmission <b>paths</b> has shown {{that it is possible to}} predict vibrational power transmission in simple beam and plate structures. However, in many practical structures transmission paths are composed of more complex curved elements; therefore, there is a need to extend vibrational power transmission analyses to this class of structure. In this paper, expressions are derived which describe the vibrational power transmission due to flexural, extensional and shear types of travelling wave in a curved beam which has a constant radius of curvature. By assuming sinusoidal wave motion, expressions are developed which relate the time-averaged power transmission to the travelling wave amplitudes. The results of numerical studies are presented which show the effects upon power transmission along a curved beam of: (i) the degree of curvature; and (ii) various simplifying assumptions made concerning beam deformation...|$|R
