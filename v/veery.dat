25|$|The Kishwaukee's bird {{population}} is not atypical for the area, which is primarily agricultural. Of the 299 species of bird that regularly occur in Illinois at least 262 {{of them can}} be found along and around the Kishwaukee River. Around 135 species have bred in and around the Kishwaukee River at some time or another. The wetlands that remain along the Kishwaukee {{are some of the most}} desirable habitat for avian species. Exner Marsh and Kloemphen Marsh, both in McHenry County have had several rookeries of great blue heron, pied-billed grebe, king rail, common gallinule, <b>veery</b> the state-endangered yellow-headed blackbird, the state-endangered osprey, and the state-threatened least bittern. Several Bald Eagles hunt and nest in the Rockford area.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a fairly}} high level of bird {{biodiversity}} in the watershed of Tenmile Run. Birds living in the stream's watershed include worm-eating warblers, wood thrushes, ovenbirds, Eastern tufted titmouses, Eastern towhees, <b>veerys,</b> pileated woodpeckers, nuthatches, common yellowthroats, and American redstarts. Other bird species found in the watershed include scarlet tanagers, black-capped chickadees, and black-throated green warblers.|$|R
50|$|This bird has a breezy, downward-spiralling, flute-like song, {{often given}} {{from a low}} and {{concealed}} perch. The most common call is a harsh, descending vee-er, which gave the bird its name. Other calls include a chuckle, a sharp and low wuck, and a slow wee-u. <b>Veeries</b> {{have been shown to}} decrease the rate and duration of singing when exposed to Barred owl playback, possibly to decrease the chance of predation.|$|R
40|$|We {{discovered}} variable {{modes of}} parental {{care in a}} breeding population of color-banded <b>Veeries</b> (Catharus fuscescens), a Nearctic-Neotropical migratory songbird, long thought to be socially monogamous, and performed a multi-locus DNA microsatellite analysis to estimate parentage and kinship {{in a sample of}} 37 adults and 21 offspring. We detected multiple mating in both sexes, and four modes of parental care that varied in frequency within and between years including multiple male feeders at some nests, and males attending multiple nests in the same season, each with a different female. Unlike other polygynandrous systems, genetic evidence indicates that multi-generational patterns of kinship occur among adult <b>Veeries</b> at our study site, and this was corroborated by the capture of an adult male in 2013 that had been banded as a nestling in 2011 at a nest attended by multiple male feeders. All genotyped adults (n = 37) were related to at least one other bird in the sample at the cousin level or greater (r ≥ 0. 125), and 81 % were related to at least one other bird at the half-sibling level or greater (r ≥ 0. 25, range 0. 25 - 0. 60). Although our sample size is small, it appears that the kin structure is maintained by natal philopatry in both sexes, and that <b>Veeries</b> avoid mating with close genetic kin. At nests where all adult feeders were genotyped (n = 9), the male(s) were unrelated to the female (mean r = - 0. 11 ± 0. 15), whereas genetic data suggest close kinship (r = 0. 254) between two male co-feeders at the nests of two females in 2011, and among three of four females that were mated to the same polygynous male in 2012. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of polygynandry occurring among multiple generations of close genetic kin on the breeding ground of a Nearctic-Neotropical migratory songbird...|$|R

50|$|They make a cup nest on {{the ground}} or near the base of a shrub. The nest {{consists}} of three structural layers, including outer, inner, and nest lining layers. The outer layer consists of leaves and supporting branches, while the inner layer consists of material woven together. Nest lining consists of flexible material such as bark, roots, and seeds. The use of different parts of 27 plant species, including invasive/alien plants, has been documented. Nests contain three to five greenish-blue eggs {{that may or may not}} have brown spots. The eggs are incubated for 10 to 14 days by the female, while both parents feed nestlings. Young <b>Veeries</b> can leave the nest between 10 and 12 days after they hatch.|$|R
50|$|Willard {{is known}} for its {{wildlife}} and particularly for the common loons that nest {{at the edge of the}} pond. The site of the nesting is usually roped off so that boaters cannot disrupt the birds. Besides loons, many other waterfowl can be found, including wood ducks and hooded mergansers. Many other birds can be spotted, including bald eagles, hawks, osprey, ravens, and turkey vultures, as well as pine warblers, hermit thrushes, black-throated blue warblers, <b>veeries,</b> winter wrens, and white-throated sparrows. The last two can be found year-round, while some of the others are seasonal birds. At the summit of Bald Mountain many other birds can be heard, including yellow-rumped warblers, dark-eyed juncos, golden-crowned kinglets, and Blackburnian warblers. In the forests surrounding the pond various animals can be found including eastern chipmunks, snowshoe hares, fishers, bobcats, eastern coyotes, white-tailed deer, black bear, moose, red squirrels, gray squirrels, and many more. At the top of Bald Mountain lots of red spruce grow, and the tree surrounding Willard are a mixture of oak, pine, and maple. Along the shores of the pond are various shrubs which include highbush blueberry, maple-leaved viburnum, and hobblebush.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Small rodents {{such as the}} white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and {{the eastern}} {{chipmunk}} (Tamias striatus) efficiently transmit Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, to feeding ticks, whereas other hosts of ticks are less efficient reservoirs of B. burgdorferi. We examined the roles of ground-foraging and ground-nesting songbirds as alternative hosts for ticks, focusing on their potential to dilute the infection prevalence of ticks (Ixodes scapularis, the black-legged tick) with B. burgdorferi. We developed a mathematical model based on the rela-tive use by ticks of rodent and bird hosts across varying host densities. We parameterized the model for sites in south-eastern New York State using original data and for the northeastern United States using published values. Our results indicate that American robins (Turdus migratorius), ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus), <b>veeries</b> (Catharus fuscescens), and wood thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) have a low capacity to dilute the prevalence of tick infection, particularly when rodents are at moderate to high densities. We attribute this result to low use by ticks of birds and a low density of birds relative to that of rodents. Only when rodents constitute less than ca. 10 – 20 % of the combined rodent and songbird host community are birds capable of substantially reducing the infection prevalence of ticks. In years or habi-tat types in which the density of rodents is low but that of ground-dwelling songbirds is high, the risk of human expo-sure to Lyme disease may reduced because birds dilute the infection prevalence of tick vectors.

The new NOU Field Card, which can be ordered by sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope to the NOU Librarian, Univ of Nebraska State Museum, Lincoln, NE 68588 - 0514, indicates species that need complete documentations, mostly casual and accidental species. However, we realize that information about early and late migration dates, and rarity in the west or east is not readily available, so in this summary we have indicated significant reports that were not accompanied by details on the sighting by using the phrase 2 ̆ 2 no details provided 2 ̆ 2 or something similar. We would very much appreciate it if observers of these reports could provide details of the sighting, including identification points and circumstances such as habitat, viewing conditions, etc. These reports are as important as those of rare birds, and {{it would be nice to}} have them substantiated. Of course sightings discussed in this report are always subject to acceptance by the NOU Records Committee; reports with asterisks denote those for which written documentation has been submitted to the NOU Records Committee.

I did not need to go outdoors to take the air, for the atmosphere within had lost none of its freshness. It was not so much within doors as behind a door where I sat, even in the rainiest weather. The Harivansa says, [...] "An abode without birds is like a meat without seasoning." [...] Such was not my abode, for I found myself suddenly neighbor to the birds; not by having imprisoned one, but having caged myself near them. I was not only nearer to some of those which commonly frequent the garden and the orchard, but to those smaller and more thrilling songsters of the forest which never, or rarely, serenade a villager--the wood thrush, the <b>veery,</b> the scarlet tanager, the field sparrow, the whip-poor-will, and many others.|$|E
