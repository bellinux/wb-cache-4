Rupture of a hollow organ, with subsequent evacuation of contents in the peritoneal cavity could also determine neurogenic shock, a subtype of distributive shock.

25|$|During storage, bladder {{pressure}} stays low, {{because of}} the bladder's highly compliant nature. A plot of bladder (intravesical) pressure against the depressant of fluid in the bladder (called a cystometrogram), will show a very slight rise as the bladder is filled. This phenomenon is {{a manifestation of the}} law of Laplace, which states that the pressure in a spherical <b>viscus</b> is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius. In the case of the bladder, the tension increases as the organ fills, but so does the radius. Therefore, the pressure increase is slight until the organ is relatively full. The bladder's smooth muscle has some inherent contractile activity; however, when its nerve supply is intact, stretch receptors in the bladder wall initiate a reflex contraction that has a lower threshold than the inherent contractile response of the muscle.|$|E
40|$|The European {{mistletoe}} (Viscum album) is an evergreen, perennial, epiphytic, hemiparasitic shrub, {{which is}} widely distributed in Europe. Its occurrence induces extremely sensitive health of host trees further {{contributing to the}} phenomenon of forest decline spiral. Besides mechanical pruning a hyperparasitic fungus (Phaeobotryosphaeria <b>visci)</b> could be a successful candidate to develop an effective biocontrol agent against V. album. We were extensively aware of the insect community of European mistletoe in light of finding another potential agent. We collected and identified 22 insect species (4 Sternorrhyncha, 5 Heteroptera, 5 Coleoptera, 5 Hymenoptera, 2 Lepidoptera, 1 Diptera) from which eight are specialists restricted only to European mistletoe (Cacopsylla <b>visci,</b> Carulaspis <b>visci,</b> Hypseloecus <b>visci,</b> Pinalitus viscicola, Ixapion variegatum, Liparthrum bartschti, Synanthedon loranthi, Celypha woodiana).

Species assotiation with this plant is reported for the first time in Hungary for the Leptophloeus hypobori species. Based on our observations and literature review only the mass occurrence of different pests would have the potential to effectively control this hemiparasite.

30|$|A {{critical}} {{trait of}} pathosystems established in plant populations {{is the degree}} to which the same pathogen populations are present and dispersed in the field. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the majority of the isolates from our study fall in the same group with strains reported in previous studies (Varga et al. 2012 a; Phillips et al. 2008). This indicates that there is a widely distributed haplotype that is predominant in Sphaeropsis <b>visci</b> populations in Hungary. It has a common ITS sequence matching with sequences known from other countries in Europe (Phillips et al. 2008). Sphaeropsis <b>visci</b> is a hyperparasitic pathogen with reported anamorphic reproducing affinity (Phillips et al. 2008). However, we currently know very little about the reproductive biology of this pathogen. Teleomorphs of this species are rarely found and the connection between Phaeobotryosphaeria <b>visci</b> and its anamorph Sphaeropsis <b>visci</b> was only recently shown (Phillips et al. 2008). The presence of different ITS types in the population could be attributed to sexual recombination as shown by Ahvenniemi et al. (Ahvenniemi et al. 2009) for Rhizoctonia solani JG Kühn. However, during our large scale field survey conducted in Hungary during 2010 (Varga et al. 2014) we were unable to find P. <b>visci</b> teleomorphs on Viscum album. Clonality of this species’ life cycle reduced variation in the analyzed population but this may increase among population, if migration is low. In the absence of high levels of gene flow, local selective sweep will remove variation within populations but will not remove variation between populations (Rydholm et al. 2006). This should be investigated in detail by further large scale analyses sampling further populations of Hungary. Such analysis of the population genetic structure of this hyperparasitic fungus is under way and would be crucial to understand the dynamics of such pathosystems.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The plant {{pathogenic}} fungus, Sphaeropsis <b>visci</b> a dark-spored {{species of}} Botryosphaeriaceae, which causes the leaf spot {{disease of the}} European mistletoe (Viscum album).

Findings Most isolates of Sphaeropsis <b>visci</b> grouped together in our phylogenetic analyses, indicating that isolates had a previously reported haplotype sequence, which is commonly found in the analyzed Hungarian population. This haplotype was also reported from diseased mistletoe bushes from other European countries. We further identified unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ITS region, which were specific to the only well resolved clade in the phylogenetic analysis.

30|$|Currently {{the best}} method to control {{mistletoe}} is to cut off infected branches of the host trees. However, mistletoe cannot be removed completely because it forms adventive shoots from the cortical strands below the cambium of the host (Zuber 2004; Varga et al. 2012 b). In order to develop Sphaeropsis <b>visci</b> as an effective bio-control agent against Viscum album more information is needed about the epidemiology, population biology {{and the existence of}} possible haplotypes of this fungus. Fungal biological control agents (BCAs) must perform well in the field tolerating wide range of climatic conditions (fluctuating temperatures, humidities, UV light), edaphic (soil types) and biotic (antagonistic) factors (Butt and Copping 2000). One of the major criticism of fungal BCAs is that they act slowly, therefore factors determining pathogen virulence should be identified and used in strain selection and quality control (Butt and Copping 2000). Cultural conditions must be identified, which retain virulence without increasing production costs. At present little {{progress has been made in}} this area with S. <b>visci,</b> however, there are efforts to identify optimal growth conditions (Varga et al. 2012 c, 2013).|$|R
30|$|Here {{we present}} the {{application}} of a diPCR-based assay for the rapid and specific detection of Sphaeropsis <b>visci</b> haplotypes without prior DNA purification. The PCR assay amplifies the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene. This region is widely used in fungal taxonomy, and used also to identify haplotypes of plant pathogenic fungi (Coates et al. 2002; Kiss et al. 2011; Nechwatal and Mendgen 2009; Bakonyi et al. 2006).|$|R

Cacopsylla <b>visci</b> (Curtis) (4.5  %) and Cacopsylla saliceti (Foerster) (4.2  %) followed C. mali in abundance. The two known AP vectors, C. picta and C. melanoneura were detected in all the orchards, although their relative occurrence was low (2.1 and 0.7  % of total catches, respectively). Two Trioza species, T. urticae (L.) (2.6  %) and T. remota Foerster (1.3  %) were also among the psyllid species with more than 25 specimens.|$|R
60|$|Consider, then, {{how great}} {{must be the}} damage inflicted by undue mental {{excitement}} on children and youths. More or less of this constitutional disturbance will inevitably follow an exertion of brain beyond the normal amount; and when not so excessive as to produce absolute illness, is sure to entail a slowly accumulating degeneracy of physique. With a small and fastidious appetite, an imperfect digestion, and an enfeebled circulation, how can the developing body flourish? The due performance of every vital process depends on an adequate supply of good blood. Without enough good blood, no gland can secrete properly, no <b>viscus</b> can fully discharge its office. Without enough good blood, no nerve, muscle, membrane, or other tissue can be efficiently repaired. Without enough good blood, growth will neither be sound nor sufficient. Judge, then, how bad must be the consequences when to a growing body the weakened stomach supplies blood that is deficient in quantity and poor in quality; while the debilitated heart propels this poor and scanty blood with unnatural slowness.|$|E
60|$|By way of unobtrusively {{introducing}} the general reader to biological truths of this class, {{let us begin}} by noticing one or two with which he is familiar. Take first, {{the relation between the}} activity of an organ and its growth. This is a universal relation. It holds, not only of a bone, a muscle, a nerve, an organ of sense, a mental faculty; but of every gland, every <b>viscus,</b> every element of the body. It is seen, not in man only, but in each animal which affords us adequate opportunity of tracing it. Always providing that the performance of function is not so excessive as to produce disorder, or to exceed the repairing powers either of the system at large or of the particular agencies by which nutriment is brought to the organ,--always providing this, it is a law of organized bodies that, other things equal, development varies as function. On this law are based all maxims and methods of right education, intellectual, moral, and physical; and when statesmen are wise enough to see it, this law will be found to underlie all right legislation.|$|E
6000|$|One {{other point}} {{has to be}} noted--the {{relative}} importance of this factor. If additional developments of muscles and bones may be transmitted--if, as Mr. Darwin held, there are various other structural modifications caused by use and disuse which imply inheritance of this kind--if acquired characters are hereditary, as the Duke of Argyll believes; then the area over which this factor of organic evolution operates is enormous. Not every muscle only, but every nerve and nerve-centre, every blood-vessel, every <b>viscus,</b> and nearly every bone, may be increased or decreased by its influence. Excepting parts which have passive functions, such as dermal appendages and the bones which form the skull, {{the implication is that}} nearly every organ in the body may be modified in successive generations by the augmented or diminished activity required of it; and, save in the few cases where the change caused is one which conduces to survival in a pre-eminent degree, it will be thus modified independently of natural selection. Though this factor can operate but little in the vegetal world, and can play but a subordinate part in the lowest animal world; yet, seeing that all the active organs of all animals are subject to its influence, it has an immense sphere. The Duke of Argyll compares the claim made for this factor to [...] "some bit of Bumbledom setting up for Home Rule--some parochial vestry claiming independence of a universal empire." [...] But, far from this, the claim made for it is to an empire, less indeed than that of natural selection, and over a small part of which natural selection exercises concurrent power; but of which the independent part has an area that is immense.|$|E
40|$|European {{mistletoe}} (Viscum album), the hemiparasitic shrub, infects a {{wide range}} of woody species. It adversely affects the height and diameter growth and it is associated with increased mortality of its hosts. Currently there are no effective control methods against it. Therefor, we started to study a specific hyperparasitic fungus (Phaeobotryosphaeria <b>visci),</b> which can completely destroy European mistletoe by infecting its branches, leaves and berries. An important aspect of the initial phase of mycopesticide candidate is culturing of the organism on artificial or non-synthetic media, followed by the optimization of spore production. We focused to determinate the growth media and light conditions needed for sporulation of P. <b>visci.</b> We also tested the viability and pathogenecy of the spores, because these are important features for further processing and applications. The cultures were grown on seven different media (potato dextrose agar, sugar free potato dextrose agar, cellophane covered potato dextrose agar, oatmeal agar, V 8 Juice agar, S medium and SNA medium) under constant dark, constant light (400 - 750 nm) and 12 h of alternating dark and light illumination. The best primary agar media were oatmeal and sugar free potato dextrose agar under permanent illumination, while constant dark inhibited the conidial production. The viability and virulence of harvested conidia were normal, and the symptoms of the disease appeared 7 - 14 days after the inoculation on mistletoe leaves. We will continue our experiments studying the effect of near UV (280 – 400 nm) light. Use of variable photoperiods supplemented with near UV and different media could help us to optimize the spore production and create a fast and cheap mass production technique...|$|R

60|$|I addrest {{myself to}} Warburg's drops (Tinctura Warburgii), a {{preparation}} invaluable for travellers {{in the tropics}} and in the lower temperates. The action appears to be chiefly on the liver through the skin. The more a traveller sees, the firmer becomes his conviction that health means the good condition of this rebellious <b>viscus,</b> and that its derangement causes the two great pests of Africa, dysentery and fever. Indeed, he is apt to become superstitious upon the subject, and {{to believe that a}} host of diseases--gout and rheumatism, cholera and enteric complaints--result from, and are to be cured or relieved only by subduing, hepatic disturbances. My 'Warburg' was procured directly from the inventor, not from the common chemist, who makes the little phialful for 9d. and sells it for 4s. 6d. Some years ago a distinguished medical friend persuaded Dr. Warburg, once of Vienna, now of London, to reveal his secret, in the forlorn hope of a liberal remuneration by the Home Government. Needless to say the reward is to come. I first learnt to appreciate this specific at Zanzibar in 1856, where Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton used it successfully in the most dangerous remittents and marsh-fevers. Cases of the febrifuge were sent out to the Coast during the Ashanti war for the benefit of army and navy: the latter, they say, made extensive use of it. I have persistently recommended it to my friends and the public; and, before leaving England in 1879, I wrote to the 'Times,' proposing that all who owe (like myself) their lives to Dr. Warburg should join in relieving his straitened means by a small subscription. At this moment (June 1882) measures are being taken in favour of the inventor, and I can only hope that the result will be favourable.|$|E
60|$|If, after contemplating these analogies of structure, we inquire {{whether there}} are any such analogies between the {{processes}} of organic change, the answer is--yes. The causes which lead to increase of bulk {{in any part of}} the body-politic, are of like nature with those which lead to increase of bulk in any part of an individual body. In both cases the antecedent is greater functional activity consequent on greater demand. Each limb, <b>viscus,</b> gland, or other member of an animal, is developed by exercise--by actively discharging the duties which the body at large requires of it; and similarly, any class of labourers or artisans, any manufacturing centre, or any official agency, begins to enlarge when the community devolves on it more work. In each case, too, growth has its conditions and its limits. That any organ in a living being may grow by exercise, there needs a due supply of blood. All action implies waste; blood brings the materials for repair; and before there can be growth, the quantity of blood supplied must be more than is requisite for repair. In a society it is the same. If to some district which elaborates for the community particular commodities--say the woollens of Yorkshire--there comes an augmented demand; and if, in fulfilment of this demand, a certain expenditure and wear of the manufacturing organization are incurred; and if, in payment for the extra quantity of woollens sent away, there comes back only such quantity of commodities as replaces the expenditure, and makes good the waste of life and machinery; there can clearly be no growth. That there may be growth, the commodities obtained in return must be more than sufficient for these ends; and just in proportion as the surplus is great will the growth be rapid. Whence it is manifest that what in commercial affairs we call profit, answers to the excess of nutrition over waste in a living body. Moreover, in both cases when the functional activity is high and the nutrition defective, there results not growth but decay. If in an animal, any organ is worked so hard that the channels which bring blood cannot furnish enough for repair, the organ dwindles: atrophy is set up. And if in the body-politic, some part has been stimulated into great productivity, and cannot afterwards get paid for all its produce, certain of its members become bankrupt, and it decreases in size.|$|E
60|$|Madeira has at once gained {{credit for}} comfort and has lost {{reputation}} as a sanatorium, a subject upon which fashion is peculiarly fickle. During the last century the Faculty sent its incurables to Lisbon and Montpellier despite the mistral and the fatal vent de bise. The latter town then lodged some 300 English families of invalids, presently reduced to a few economists and wine-merchants. Succeeded Nice and Pisa, {{one of the most}} wearying and relaxing of 'sick bays;' and Pau in the Pyrenees, of which the native Béarnais said that the year has eight months of winter and four of inferno. Madeira then rose in the world, and a host of medical residents sounded her praises, till Mentone was written up and proved a powerful rival. And the climate of the hot-damp category was found to suit, mainly if not only, that tubercular cachexy and those, bronchial affections and lung-lesions in which the <b>viscus</b> would suffer from the over-excitement of an exceedingly dry air like the light invigorating medium of Tenerife or Thebes. Lastly, when phthisis was determined to be a disease of debility, of anæmia, of organic exhaustion, and of defective nutrition, cases fitted for Madeira were greatly limited. Here instruments deceive us as to humidity. The exceeding dampness is shown by the rusting of iron and the tarnishing of steel almost as effectually as upon the West African coast. Yet Mr. Vivian's observations, assuming 100 to be saturation, made Torquay 76 and Funchal 73. [Footnote: Others make the mean humidity of Funchal 76, and remark that in the healthiest and most pleasant climates the figures range between 70 and 80]. Moreover it was found out that consumption, as well as intermittent fevers, are common on the island, so common, indeed, as to require an especial hospital for the poorer classes, although the people declare them to have been imported by the stranger. I may here observe that while amongst all the nations of Southern Europe great precautions are taken against the contagion of true phthisis, English medicos seem to ignore it. A Pisan housekeeper will even repaper the rooms after the death of a consumptive patient. At Funchal sufferers in every stage of the disease live in the same house and even in the same rooms.|$|E

40|$|There {{are more}} than 3000 ha in Hungary {{infected}} by European mistletoe (Viscum album L.), which have currently raised. The only way to control this hemiparasite is to cut down the infected branches, while other effective control methods are unknown. Our research focused on the efficiency of herbicide control methods against V. album. We tested three herbicide agents and combinations in three concentrations during our study (glyphosate isopropylamine salt, 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, methsulphuron-methil). After the pesticide treatments the phototoxic effects were studied on mistletoe shrubs and on the host trees (Acer campestre L.) too. The most efficient agent was 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, which caused the whole necrosis of mistletoe shrubs even in the lowest concentration, but low chlorosis, rarification of foliage and drying of twigs were detected on the host trees. Phaeobotriosphaeria <b>visci,</b> which seems suitable for biological control, appeared 3 – 6 months after the application of 2, 4 -D on the necrotic mistletoe shrubs. Therefore the effect of 2, 4 -D and glyphosate on the mycelial growth were examined under in vitro laboratory conditions. Even the lowest herbicide concentration caused significantly lower mycelial growth; besides higher concentrations no mycelial growth was detected.

6000|$|By what process does {{a changed}} part modify other parts? By modifying their {{functions}} {{in some way}} or degree, seems the necessary answer. It is indeed, imaginable, that where the part changed is some dermal appendage which, becoming larger, has abstracted more of the needful material from the general stock, the effect may consist simply in diminishing the amount of this material available for other dermal appendages, leading to diminution of some or all of them, and may fail to affect in appreciable ways the rest of the organism: save perhaps the blood-vessels near the enlarged appendage. But where the part is an active one--a limb, or <b>viscus,</b> or any organ which constantly demands blood, produces waste matter, secretes, or absorbs--then all the other active organs become implicated in the change. The functions performed by them have to constitute a moving equilibrium; and the function of one cannot, by alteration of the structure performing it, be modified in degree or kind, without modifying the functions of the rest--some appreciably and others inappreciably, according to the directness or indirectness of their relations. Of such inter-dependent changes, the normal ones are naturally inconspicuous; but those which are partially or completely abnormal, sufficiently carry home the general truth. Thus, unusual cerebral excitement affects the excretion through the kidneys in quantity or quality or both. Strong emotions of disagreeable kinds check or arrest the flow of bile. A considerable obstacle to the circulation offered by some important structure in a diseased or disordered state, throwing more strain upon the heart, causes hypertrophy of its muscular walls; and this change which is, so far as concerns the primary evil, a remedial one, often entails mischiefs in other organs. [...] "Apoplexy and palsy, in a scarcely credible number of cases, are directly dependent on hypertrophic enlargement of the heart." [...] And in other cases, asthma, dropsy, and epilepsy are caused. Now if a result of this inter-dependence as seen in the individual organism, is that a local modification of one part produces, by changing their functions, correlative modifications of other parts, then the question here to be put is--Are these correlative modifications, when of a kind falling within normal limits, inheritable or not. If they are inheritable, then the fact stated by Mr. Darwin that [...] "when one part is modified through continued selection," [...] "other parts of the organization will be unavoidably modified" [...] is perfectly intelligible: these entailed secondary modifications are transmitted pari passu with the successive modifications produced by selection. But what if they are not inheritable? Then these secondary modifications caused in the individual, not being transmitted to descendants, the descendants must commence life with organizations out of balance, and with each increment of change in the part affected by selection, their organizations must get more out of balance--must have a larger and larger amounts of re-organization to be made during their lives. Hence the constitution of the variety must become more and more unworkable.|$|E
60|$|From confirmations thus {{furnished}} by sociology to physiology, {{let us now}} pass to {{a suggestion}} similarly furnished. A factory, or other producing establishment, or a town made up of such establishments, is an agency for elaborating some commodity consumed by society at large; and may be regarded as analogous to a gland or <b>viscus</b> in an individual organism. If we inquire what is the primitive mode in which one of these producing establishments grows up, we find it to be this. A single worker, who himself sells the produce of his labour, is the germ. His business increasing, he employs helpers--his sons or others; and having done this, he becomes a vendor not only of his own handiwork, but of that of others. A further increase of his business compels him to multiply his assistants, and his sale grows so rapid that he is obliged to confine himself {{to the process of}} selling: he ceases to be a producer, and becomes simply a channel through which the produce of others is conveyed to the public. Should his prosperity rise yet higher, he finds that he is unable to manage even the sale of his commodities, and has to employ others, probably of his own family, to aid him in selling; so that, to him as a main channel are now added subordinate channels. Moreover, when there grow up in one place, as a Manchester or a Birmingham, many establishments of like kind, this process is carried still further. There arise factors and buyers, who are the channels through which is transmitted the produce of many factories; and we believe that primarily these factors were manufacturers who undertook to dispose of the produce of smaller houses as well as their own, and ultimately became salesmen only. Under a converse aspect, all the stages of this development have been within these few years exemplified in our railway contractors. There are sundry men now living who illustrate the whole process in their own persons--men who were originally navvies, digging and wheeling; who then undertook some small sub-contract, and worked along with those they paid; who presently took larger contracts, and employed foremen; and who now contract for whole railways, and let portions to sub-contractors. That is to say, we have men who were originally workers, but have finally become the main channels out of which diverge secondary channels, which again bifurcate into the subordinate channels, through which flows the money (representing the nutriment) supplied by society to the actual makers of the railway. Now it seems worth inquiring whether this is not the original course followed in the evolution of secreting and excreting organs in an animal. We know that such is the process by which the liver is developed. Out of the group of bile-cells forming the germ of it, some centrally-placed ones, lying next to the intestine, are transformed into ducts through which the secretion of the peripheral bile-cells is poured into the intestine; and as the peripheral bile-cells multiply, there similarly arise secondary ducts emptying themselves into the main ones; tertiary ones into these; and so on. Recent inquiries show that the like is the case with the lungs,--that the bronchial tubes are thus formed. But while analogy suggests that this is the original mode in which such organs are developed, {{it at the same time}} suggests that this does not necessarily continue to be the mode. For as we find that in the social organism, manufacturing establishments are no longer commonly developed through the series of modifications above described, but now mostly arise by the direct transformation of a number of persons into master, clerks, foremen, workers, &c.; so the approximate method of forming organs, may in some cases be replaced by a direct metamorphosis of the organic units into the destined structure, without any transitional structures being passed through. That there are organs thus formed is an ascertained fact; and the additional question which analogy suggests is, whether the direct method is substituted for the indirect method.|$|E

30|$|A {{thorough}} and extensive sampling (7  years, 50 orchards) in Germany, France and Switzerland reported 25 psyllid species inhabiting apple orchards (Jarausch et al. 2009). With a considerably lower effort (2  years, 5 orchards) we collected 22 species, varying {{the number of}} species per site between 15 and 19. Such a high richness is likely a consequence of the low pesticide input in our cider-apple orchards as well as the high plant richness in the orchards and their surroundings (Miñarro and Prida 2013; Rosa García and Miñarro 2014), since most of the collected psyllids have not apple among their hosts (Ossiannilsson 1992; Jarausch et al. 2009). In fact, only three species, C. mali, C. picta and C. melanoneura, have apple as a host (Ossiannilsson 1992). They are the most abundant psyllids in apple orchards (Jarausch et al. 2009), although not in our study. The occurrence and density of the Ctenarytaina species are easily explained by the wide distribution of eucalypt crops in the surroundings of the orchards (Rosa García et al. 2014). The third most abundant species, C. <b>visci,</b> has mistletoe (Viscum album L.) as host (Hansen and Hodkinson 2006), and this parasitic plant frequently grows on apple in our region. The other abundant species, C. saliceti, T. urticae and T. remota Foerster, live on Salix, Urtica and Quercus, respectively (Ossiannilsson 1992), all of which can be either present in the orchards or in nearby habitats.|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{die-back}} andmortality {{of various}} ornamental {{trees and shrubs}} has been observed in parts of the Western Balkans region during the past decade. The disease symptomshave been typical of those caused by pathogens residing in the Botryosphaeriaceae. The aims of this study were to isolate and characterize Botryosphaeriaceae species associated with diseased ornamental trees in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Isolates were initially characterized based on the DNA sequence data for the internal transcribed spacer rDNA and six major clades were identified. Representative isolates from each clade were further characterized using DNA sequence data for the translation elongation factor 1 -alpha, b-tubulin- 2 and large subunit rRNA gene regions, as well as the morphology of the asexualmorphs. Ten species of theBotryosphaeriaceae were identified of which eight, i. e., Dothiorella sarmentorum, Neofusicoccum parvum, Botryosphaeria dothidea, Phaeobotryon cupressi, Sphaeropsis <b>visci,</b> Diplodia seriata, D. sapinea and D. mutila were known taxa. The remaining two species could be identified only as Dothiorella spp. Dichomera syn-asexual morphs of D. sapinea, Dothiorella sp. 2 and B. dothidea, aswell as unique morphological characters for a number of the known species are described. Based on host plants and geographic distribution, the majority of Botryosphaeriaceae species found represent new records. The results of this study contribute to our knowledge of the distribution, host associations and impacts of these fungi on trees in urban environments.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{give an account}} of the genera and species in the Botryosphaeriaceae. We {{consider}} morphological characters alone as inadequate to define genera or identify species, given the confusion it has repeatedly introduced in the past, their variation during development, and inevitable overlap as representation grows. Thus it seems likely that all of the older taxa linked to the Botryosphaeriaceae, and for which cultures or DNA sequence data are not available, cannot be linked to the species in this family that are known from culture. Such older taxa will have to be disregarded for future use unless they are epitypified. We therefore focus this paper on the 17 genera that can now be recognised phylogenetically, which concentrates on the species that are presently known from culture. Included is a historical overview of the family, the morphological features that define the genera and species and detailed descriptions of the 17 genera and 110 species. Keys to the genera and species are also provided. Phylogenetic relationships of the genera are given in a multi-locus tree based on combined SSU, ITS, LSU, EF 1 -α and β-tubulin sequences. The morphological descriptions are supplemented by phylogenetic trees (ITS alone or ITS + EF 1 -α) for the species in each genus.
