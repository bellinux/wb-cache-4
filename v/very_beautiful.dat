5|$|Matilda had a younger, {{legitimate}} brother, William Adelin, and her father's {{relationships with}} numerous mistresses resulted in around 22 illegitimate siblings.

In 1108 Henry left Matilda and her brother {{in the care of}} Anselm, the Archbishop of Canterbury, while he travelled to Normandy; Anselm was a favoured cleric of Matilda's mother.

She had just returned from education in France and Switzerland, and was reckoned as <b>very</b> <b>beautiful</b> by her acquaintances. She was the daughter of Constantine's Master of the Horse, Colonel Petros Manos, and his wife Maria Argyropoulos. The 21-year-old Alexander was smitten, and was so determined to seduce her that he followed her to the island of Spetses where she holidayed that year. Initially, Aspasia was resistant to his charm; although considered very handsome by his contemporaries, Alexander had a reputation as a ladies' man from numerous past liaisons. Despite this, he finally won her over, and the couple were engaged in secret. However, for King Constantine I, Queen Sophia and much of European society of the time, it was inconceivable for a royal prince to marry someone of a different social rank.|$|E
