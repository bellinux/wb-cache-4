5|$|Many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} advanced {{as to what}} functions the cranial crest of Parasaurolophus performed, but most have been discredited. It is now believed {{that it may have}} had several functions: <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> for identifying species and sex, sound amplification for communication, and thermoregulation. It is not clear which was most significant at what times {{in the evolution of the}} crest and its internal nasal passages.|$|E
5|$|Like the sassabies, {{hartebeest}} produce quiet quacking and grunting sounds. Juveniles {{tend to be}} {{more vocal}} than adults, and produce a quacking call when alarmed or pursued. The hartebeest uses defecation as an olfactory and <b>visual</b> <b>display.</b> Herds are generally sedentary, and tend to migrate only under adverse conditions such as natural calamities. The hartebeest is the least migratory in the tribe Alcelaphini (which also includes wildebeest and sassabies), and also consumes the least amount of water and has the lowest metabolic rate among the members of the tribe.|$|E

Thus, no telemanipulation system is adequate {{which does not}} make extensive use of <b>visual</b> <b>displays.</b> Although an important use of <b>visual</b> <b>displays</b> is the presentation of a televised image of the work scene, <b>visual</b> <b>displays</b> are examined for presentation of nonvisual information (forces and torques) for simulation and planning, and for management {{and control of the}} large numbers of subsystems which make up a modern telemanipulation system...|$|R
40|$|Analogy is a {{powerful}} heuristic for problem solving. In design, where designers are constantly exposed to visual stimuli, visual analogies {{are considered to be}} particularly helpful. To date, however, few researchers have given enough attention to visual analogy and <b>visual</b> <b>displays</b> in design contexts. This study deals with the use of these tools by investigating the effect that expertise has on them, in ill-defined and well-defined problem solving. Novice and experienced designers solved both types of design problem with exposure to <b>visual</b> <b>displays</b> and with the requirement to use visual analogy. Results showed that when <b>visual</b> <b>displays</b> and instructions to use analogy were available no expertise differences existed in well-defined problem solving. However, with the availability of only <b>visual</b> <b>displays,</b> architects tend to perform better than students. Without guidance to use analogy, students found difficulty in spontaneous recall of <b>visual</b> <b>displays</b> as candidate analogues in well-defined problems. In ill-defined problem solving, architects performed better than novice students in the use of both analogy and <b>visual</b> <b>displays.</b> However, no {{differences were found between the}} experienced designers and the advanced students in any experimental condition in this problem context. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{theory of}} frill use in sexual display was first {{proposed}} in 1961 by Davitashvili. This theory has gained increasing acceptance. Evidence that <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> was important, either in courtship {{or in other}} social behavior, {{can be seen in}} the fact that horned dinosaurs differ markedly in their adornments, making each species highly distinctive. Also, modern living creatures with such displays of horns and adornments use them in similar behavior. The use of the exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists in modern species.|$|E
5|$|Kates {{built the}} game to {{showcase}} his additron tube, a miniature version of the vacuum tube, though the transistor overtook it in computer development shortly thereafter. Patent issues prevented the additron tube from being used in computers besides Bertie before {{it was no longer}} useful. Bertie the Brain is a candidate for the first video game, as it was potentially the first computer game to have any sort of <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> of the game. It appeared only three years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display. Berties use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions of a video game.|$|E
5|$|The Saturn had {{technically}} impressive hardware at {{the time}} of its release, but its complexity made harnessing this power difficult for developers accustomed to conventional programming. The greatest disadvantage was that both CPUs shared the same bus and were unable to access system memory at the same time. Making full use of the 4kB of cache memory in each CPU was critical to maintaining performance. For example, Virtua Fighter used one CPU for each character, while Nights used one CPU for 3D environments and the other for 2D objects. The Saturn's <b>Visual</b> <b>Display</b> Processor 2 (VDP2), which can generate and manipulate backgrounds, has also been cited as one of the system's most important features.|$|E

5|$|The game of Nim {{running on}} the Nimrod is a {{candidate}} for one of the first video games, as {{it was one of the}} first computer games to have any sort of <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> of the game. It appeared only four years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display, and one year after Bertie the Brain, a computer similar to the Nimrod which played tic-tac-toe at the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. The Nimrod's use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions of a video game.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{birds are}} known to {{communicate}} using visual and auditory signals, and the wide diversity of <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> structures among fossil dinosaur groups, such as horns, frills, crests, sails and feathers, suggests that visual communication has always been important in dinosaur biology. Reconstruction of the plumage color of Anchiornis huxleyi, suggest the importance of color in visual communication in non-avian dinosaurs. The evolution of dinosaur vocalization is less certain. Paleontologist Phil Senter suggests that non-avian dinosaurs relied mostly on visual displays and possibly non-vocal acoustic sounds like hissing, jaw grinding or clapping, splashing and wing beating (possible in winged maniraptoran dinosaurs). He states they were unlikely to have been capable of vocalizing since their closest relatives, crocodilians and birds, use different means to vocalize, the former via the larynx and the latter through the unique syrinx, suggesting they evolved independently and their common ancestor was mute.|$|E
5|$|The Nimrod {{was created}} {{only four years}} after the 1947 {{invention}} of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, and one year after a similar purpose built game-playing machine, Bertie the Brain, the first computer-based game to feature a <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> of any sort. The Nimrod is considered under some definitions one of the first video games, possibly the second. While definitions vary, the prior cathode-ray tube amusement device was a purely analog electrical game, and while the Nimrod and Bertie did not feature an electronic screen they both had a game running on a computer. The software-based tic-tac-toe game OXO and a draughts program by Christopher Strachey were programmed a year later in 1952 and were the first computer games to display visuals on an electronic screen rather than through light bulbs.|$|E

5|$|The {{other main}} {{behavioural}} {{theory is that}} the crest was used for intra-species recognition. This means that the crest could have been used for species recognition, as a warning signal, and for other, non-sexual uses. These could have been some of the reasons crests evolved in Parasaurolophus and other hadrosaurids. Instead, social and physiological functions have become more supported as function(s) of the crest, focusing on visual and auditory identification and communication. As a large object, the crest has clear value as a visual signal, and sets this animal apart from its contemporaries. The large size of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the presence of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. If, as is commonly illustrated, a skin frill extended from the crest to the neck or back, the proposed <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> would have been even showier. As is suggested by other lambeosaurine skulls, the crest of Parasaurolophus likely permitted both species identification (such as separating it from Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus) and sexual identification by shape and size.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} {{their use in}} sexual display was first {{proposed}} by Davitashvili in 1961 and has gained increasing acceptance since. Evidence that <b>visual</b> <b>display</b> was important, either in courtship or in other social behavior, {{can be seen in}} the fact that horned dinosaurs differ markedly in their adornments, making each species highly distinctive. Also, modern living creatures with such displays of horns and adornments use them in similar behavior. A 2006 study of the smallest Triceratops skull, ascertained to be a juvenile, shows the frill and horns developed at a very early age, predating sexual development and thus probably important for visual communication and species recognition in general. The use of the exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists for structures in modern species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Visual</b> <b>display</b> was prized. Brilliant {{colors were}} {{obtained}} by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of leeks. Yellow came from saffron or egg yolk, while red came from sunflower, and purple came from Crozophora tinctoria or Heliotropium europaeum. Gold and silver leaf were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as tourte parmerienne which was a pastry dish {{made to look like}} a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with gold leaf. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast swan or peacock sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being gilded. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.|$|E

25|$|The {{two major}} {{divisions}} of hadrosaurids are differentiated by their cranial ornamentation. While {{members of the}} Lambeosaurinae subfamily have hollow crests that differ depending on species, members of the Saurolophinae (Hadrosaurinae) subfamily have solid crests or none at all.

40|$|Creativity is {{a primary}} and {{essential}} part of the engineering design process. So, multiple support tools are developed to aid engineers and designers in the creative design process. The use of <b>visual</b> <b>displays</b> is seen as a helpful and encouraging tool in design problem solving. The paper concludes a brief literature on the engineering design process, activities performed during its stages and various methods that can stimulate creativity in different steps of this process. This study describes analogy as a supportive and powerful tool mentioned in the literature for creative design. It helps to explain new problems in terms of familiar ones and involves the transfer of relational information between two situations. So, analogy can help designers to use <b>visual</b> <b>displays</b> in a new and creative way. The study presents the process of using <b>visual</b> <b>displays</b> in design and the results suggest that practicing with a large and diverse number of <b>visual</b> <b>displays</b> can help engineering designers in general, to spontaneously retrieve significant information, and to enhance their design abilities. It’s especially crucial in generating creative ideas and therefore creative products...|$|R
