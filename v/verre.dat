50|$|<b>Verrès</b> Castle (Castello di <b>Verrès,</b> Château de <b>Verrès)</b> is a {{fortified}} 14th-century {{castle in}} <b>Verrès,</b> {{in the lower}} Aosta Valley, in north-western Italy. It has been {{called one of the}} most impressive buildings from the Middle Ages in the area. Built as a military fortress by Yblet de Challant in the fourteenth century, {{it was one of the}} first examples of a castle constructed as a single structure rather than as a series of buildings enclosed in a circuit wall. The castle stands on a rocky promonitory on the opposite side of the Dora Baltea from Issogne Castle. The castle dominates the town of <b>Verrès</b> and the access to the Val d'Ayas. From the outside it looks like an austere cube, thirty metres long on each side and practically free of decorative elements.|$|R
5000|$|In Cicero's speech Against <b>Verres,</b> {{delivered}} in late 70 BC, Cicero, the attorney prosecuting {{on behalf of}} the province of Sicily, denounces <b>Verres,</b> the defendant on trial, in the extortion court. <b>Verres</b> was the governor of Sicily from 73-71 BC, and the Sicilians charged him with being morally corrupt and flagrant with bribery as well as having stolen 40 million sesterces worth of money and items from Sicily. They also charged him with having killed Roman citizens without trial, something forbidden by Roman law. Creticus and Quintus Hortensius Hortalus were to be the two consuls in the coming year. They were both friends with <b>Verres,</b> and they supported him; Hortalus was his defense lawyer. Marcus Caecilius Metellus, one of Creticus' brothers, was {{to be president of the}} extortion court in the coming year. The defense planned to put the trial off until the coming year, when Quintus Caecilius Metellus, Quintus Hortensius Hortalus, and Marcus Caecilius Metellus would be able to influence the court's decision. Quintus Caecilius Metellus sent for the Sicilians and told them that <b>Verres</b> would come to no harm due to the power invested in himself, his family, and other supporters of <b>Verres</b> in the coming year. Because of this, Cicero reviles Quintus Caecilius Metellus as corrupt to the point that he would [...] "throw duty and dignity to the winds" [...] without even having a real connection to <b>Verres.</b> Cicero goes on to suggest twice that Quintus Caecilius Metellus won his office due to Verres' bribery rather than his own merit, and tries to turn Quintus Caecilius Metellus against <b>Verres</b> by stating that <b>Verres</b> proclaimed it to be so.|$|R
50|$|Hortensius and <b>Verres</b> both knew, Cicero argued, that Quintus Metellus, {{a friend}} and ally would {{be in charge of}} the {{extortion}} court in the new year, and so saw a benefit to such a gaming of the system. Cicero remarked that one of his friends had heard Hortensius congratulate <b>Verres</b> in the Forum soon after Metellus' election, announcing that this meant that <b>Verres</b> was as good as acquitted.|$|R

25|$|Klee {{began to}} {{introduce}} a new technique in 1905: scratching on a blackened glass panel with a needle. In that manner he created about 57 <b>Verre</b> églomisé pictures, among those the 1905 Gartenszene (Scene on a Garden) and the 1906 Porträt des Vaters (Portrait of a Father), with which he tried to combine painting and scratching.

25|$|In 1594, the Compagnie van <b>Verre</b> ("Company of Far Lands") {{was founded}} in Amsterdam, {{with the aim of}} sending two fleets to the spice islands of Maluku. The first fleet sailed in 1596 and {{returned}} in 1597 with a cargo of pepper, which more than covered the costs of the voyage. The second voyage (1598–1599), returned its investors a 400% profit. The success of these voyages led to the founding of a number of companies competing for the trade. The competition was counterproductive to the companies' interests as it threatened to drive up the price of spices at their source in Indonesia whilst driving them down in Europe.|$|E

In 2005, the museum sold two paintings by Marc Chagall and Auguste Renoir at Sotheby's. In 2011, it auctioned two Picassos (Sur l'impériale traversant la Seine (1901) and <b>Verre</b> et pipe (1919)), Henri Matisse's Femme au fauteuil (1919), and Georges Braque's Nature morte à la guitare (rideaux rouge) (1938) at Christie's in London.|$|E

Restaurants at the Dubai Creek and Connaught hotels followed, the latter branded with his protégé Angela Hartnett's name. Ramsay has opened restaurants outside the UK, beginning with <b>Verre</b> in Dubai. Two restaurants, Gordon Ramsay at Conrad Tokyo and Cerise by Gordon Ramsay, both opened in Tokyo in 2005.

2500|$|Duchamp's {{interest}} in kinetic works can be discerned {{as early as}} the notes for The Large Glass and the Bicycle Wheel readymade, and despite losing {{interest in}} [...] "retinal art", he retained interest in visual phenomena. In 1920, with help from Man Ray, Duchamp built a motorized sculpture, Rotative plaques <b>verre,</b> optique de précision ("Rotary Glass Plates, Precision Optics"). The piece, which he did not consider to be art, involved a motor to spin pieces of rectangular glass on which were painted segments of a circle. When the apparatus spins, an optical illusion occurs, in which the segments appear to be closed concentric circles. Man Ray set up equipment to photograph the initial experiment, but when they turned the machine on for the second time, a belt broke, and caught a piece of the glass, which after glancing off Man Ray's head, shattered into bits.|$|E
