5|$|If it {{is unclear}} what counts as science, how the process of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for <b>values</b> and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, <b>values</b> can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural <b>values</b> held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and <b>values</b> concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time).
