40|$|It is {{possible}} to set up <b>virtual</b> <b>connections</b> across multiple ATM switches using ATM Forum's Private NetworkNetwork Interface (PNNI). However, the PNNI protocol is a complex signalling protocol. Although PNNI supports QoS routing, current ATM switches may not fully implement QoS routing as in the PNNI specification [1]. This paper describes a system for creating <b>virtual</b> <b>connections</b> based on QoS requirements, thus providing basic QoS routing functionality. The system maintains upto -date link-state information in a centralised database, and distributes system tasks such as connection set-up, QoS route selection and detection of link failures, to a few subsystems in a scalable manner.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a fundamental problem in resource management for flow-based hybrid switching systems. Such systems aim at efficient transport of layer 3 connectionless IP traffic over layer 2 connection-oriented ATM switching fabrics. One idea behind flow-based hybrid switching is to decompose individual IP packet streams into flows {{and then to}} classify them into short-lived flows and long-lived flows. While the short-lived flows are good for forwarding by the embedded software through permanent <b>virtual</b> <b>connections</b> (PVC), the long-lived flows are more effectively transmitted by hardware through switched <b>virtual</b> <b>connections</b> (SVC). Clearly the flow identification /classification mechanism will have great impact on the utilization of the system's resources. Unlike the traditional emphasis on resources such as link bandwidth and cell buffer size, our paper focuses on the resources which are directly associated with packet processing power, signalling capacity and flow cache table size [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{an optical}} packet-switched node subject to asynchronous, variable-length packets and connectionoriented operation. We firstly {{address the problem}} of setting up the optical <b>virtual</b> <b>connections</b> and properly configuring the forwarding table at the node. We do not deal with routing aspects, but with the efficient mapping of the <b>virtual</b> <b>connections</b> to the wavelengths of the output ports. In this context, we suggest a wavelength assignment procedure that improves the node performance in comparison with simple random or balanced schemes. We then address the QoS provisioning problem. While existing solutions focus on applying some forms of resource reservation on top of the contention resolution algorithm, here we propose a method based on the well-known ATM scheme of defining different service categories. In particular, we define a case study with three OPS service categories, and for each category a specific contention resolution algorithm is applied. With such a strategy the algorithms present the problem of a different performance alignment; we solve it by designing an ad hoc optical buffer architecture based on non-degenerate delays. The performance of the final node architecture is evaluated by simulation. The results obtained indicate the merits of this method, which opens up interesting future developments for a whole optical network scenario. Postprint (published version...|$|R
