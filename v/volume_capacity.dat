500|$|For thermosets, {{typically}} {{two different}} chemical components are {{injected into the}} barrel. These components immediately begin irreversible chemical reactions which eventually crosslinks the material into a single connected network of molecules. As the chemical reaction occurs, the two fluid components permanently transform into a viscoelastic solid. [...] Solidification in the injection barrel and screw can be problematic and have financial repercussions; therefore, minimising the thermoset curing within the barrel is vital. This typically means that the residence time and temperature of the chemical precursors are minimised in the injection unit. The residence time can be reduced by minimising the barrel's <b>volume</b> <b>capacity</b> and by maximising the cycle times. These factors {{have led to the}} use of a thermally isolated, cold injection unit that injects the reacting chemicals into a thermally isolated hot mould, which increases the rate of chemical reactions and results in shorter time required to achieve a solidified thermoset component. After the part has solidified, valves close to isolate the injection system and chemical precursors, and the mould opens to eject the moulded parts. Then, the mould closes and the process repeats.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Decompressive {{laparotomy}} {{followed by}} temporary abdominal closure (TAC) is an established prophylaxis and treatment for abdominal compartment syndrome. The herein presented study {{aimed at the}} comparison of <b>volume</b> reserve <b>capacity</b> and development of intra-abdominal hypertension after forced primary abdominal closure and different TAC techniques in a porcine model. METHODS: Eight anesthesized and mechanically ventilated domestic pigs underwent a standardized midline laparotomy. A bag was placed into the abdominal cavity. Before abdominal closure, the bag was prefilled with 3, 000 mL water to simulate increased intra-abdominal volume. The intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) was then increased in 2 mm Hg steps up to 30 mm Hg by adding <b>volume</b> (<b>volume</b> reserve <b>capacity)</b> to the intra-abdominal bag. <b>Volume</b> reserve <b>capacity</b> with the corresponding IAP were analyzed and compared for primary abdominal closure, bag silo closure, a zipper system, and vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) with different negative pressures (- 50, - 100, and - 150 mm Hg). Hemodynamic and pulmonary parameters were monitored throughout the experiment. RESULTS: <b>Volume</b> reserve <b>capacity</b> was the highest for bag silo closure followed by the zipper system and VAC with primary abdominal closure providing the least <b>volume</b> reserve <b>capacity</b> in the whole IAP range. Of interest, VAC - 50 mm Hg resulted in a lower <b>volume</b> reserve <b>capacity</b> when compared with VAC - 100 and - 150 mm Hg. Pulmonary and hemodynamic parameters demonstrated {{no significant differences between}} primary abdominal closure and the evaluated TAC techniques at all IAP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The present experimental in vivo study indicates that bag silo closure and zipper systems may be favorable TAC techniques after decompressive laparotomy. In contrast, the VAC techniques resulted in lower <b>volume</b> reserve <b>capacity</b> and therefore may bear an increased risk for recurrent intra-abdominal hypertension in the initial phase after decompressive laparotomy...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{assess the}} effects of obesity on lung <b>volume</b> and <b>capacity</b> in {{children}} and adolescents. Data sourceThis is a systematic review, carried out in Pubmed, Lilacs, Scielo and PEDro databases, using the following Keywords: Plethysmography; Whole Body OR Lung Volume Measurements OR Total Lung Capacity OR Functional Residual <b>Capacity</b> OR Residual <b>Volume</b> AND Obesity. Observational studies or clinical trials that assessed {{the effects of}} obesity on lung <b>volume</b> and <b>capacity</b> {{in children and adolescents}} (0 – 18 years) without any other associated disease; in English; Portuguese and Spanish languages were selected. Methodological quality was assessed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Data synthesisOf the 1, 030 articles, only four were included in the review. The studies amounted to 548 participants, predominantly males, with sample size ranging from 45 to 327 individuals. 100 % of the studies evaluated nutritional status through BMI (z-score) and 50. 0 % reported the data on abdominal circumference. All demonstrated that obesity causes negative effects on lung <b>volume</b> and <b>capacity,</b> causing a reduction mainly in functional residual capacity in 75. 0 % of the studies; in the expiratory reserve volume in 50. 0 % and in the residual volume in 25. 0 %. The methodological quality ranged from moderate to high, with 75. 0 % of the studies classified as having high methodological quality.

40|$|Abstract Phrenic nerve is {{the main}} nerve drive to the {{diaphragm}} and its injury is a well-known complication following cardiac surgeries. It results in diaphragmatic dysfunction with reduction in lung <b>volumes</b> and <b>capacities.</b> This study aimed to evaluate the objectivity of lung <b>volumes</b> and <b>capacities</b> as an outcome measure for the prognosis of phrenic nerve recovery after cardiac surgeries. In this prospective experimental study, patients were recruited from Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Department, Educational-Hospital of College of Medicine, Cairo University. They were 11 patients with right phrenic nerve injury and 14 patients with left injury. On the basis of receiving low-level laser irradiation, they were divided into irradiated group and non-irradiated group. Measures of phrenic nerve latency, lung <b>volumes</b> and <b>capacities</b> were taken pre and post-operative and at 3 -months follow up. After 3 months of low-level laser therapy, the irradiated group showed marked improvement in the phrenic nerve recovery. On the other hand, vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in the first second were the only lung <b>capacity</b> and <b>volume</b> that showed improvement consequent with the recovery of right phrenic nerve (P value < 0. 001 for both). Furthermore, forced vital capacity was the single lung capacity that showed significant statistical improvement in patients with recovered left phrenic nerve injury (P value < 0. 001). Study concluded that lung <b>volumes</b> and <b>capacities</b> cannot {{be used as an}} objective outcome measure for recovery of phrenic nerve injury after cardiac surgeries...|$|R
40|$|Large space {{telescope}} missions {{have always been}} limited by their launch vehicle's mass and <b>volume</b> <b>capacities.</b> The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was specifically designed to fit inside the Space Shuttle and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is specifically designed to fit inside an Ariane 5. Astrophysicists desire even larger {{space telescope}}s. NASA's "Enduring Quests Daring Visions" report calls for an 8 - to 16 -m Large UV-Optical-IR (LUVOIR) Surveyor mission to enable ultra-high-contrast spectroscopy and coronagraphy. AURA's "From Cosmic Birth to Living Earth" report calls for a 12 -m class High-Definition Space Telescope to pursue transformational scientific discoveries. NASA's "Planning for the 2020 Decadal Survey" calls for a Habitable Exoplanet Imaging (HabEx) and a LUVOIR as well as Far-IR and an X-Ray Surveyor missions. Packaging larger space telescopes into existing launch vehicles is a significant engineering complexity challenge that drives cost and risk. NASA's planned Space Launch System (SLS), with its 8 or 10 -m diameter fairings and ability to deliver 35 to 45 -mt of payload to Sun-Earth-Lagrange- 2, mitigates this challenge by fundamentally changing the design paradigm for large space telescopes. This paper reviews the mass and <b>volume</b> <b>capacities</b> of the planned SLS, discusses potential implications of these capacities for designing large space telescope missions, and gives three specific mission concept implementation examples: a 4 -m monolithic off-axis telescope, an 8 -m monolithic on-axis telescope and a 12 -m segmented on-axis telescope...|$|R
