5|$|The T-26 was a Soviet {{development}} of the British <b>Vickers</b> 6-Ton (<b>Vickers</b> Mk.E) (the Polish 7TP tank was another {{development of}} <b>Vickers</b> E 6-Ton) tank, which was designed by the Vickers-Armstrongs company in 1928–29. The simple and easy-to-maintain <b>Vickers</b> 6-Ton was intended for export to less technically advanced countries: the Soviet Union, Poland, Brazil, Argentina, Japan, Thailand, China, and many others. <b>Vickers</b> advertised the tank in military publications, and both the Soviet Union and Poland expressed interest in the <b>Vickers</b> design.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1959, English Electric (EE) and <b>Vickers</b> {{worked on}} {{combining}} {{the best of}} both designs in order to put forward a joint design with a view to having an aircraft flying by 1963, while also working on merging the companies under the umbrella of the British Aircraft Corporation (along with Bristol Aircraft). EE had put forward a delta winged design and <b>Vickers,</b> a swept wing on a long fuselage. The EE wing, born of their greater supersonic experience, was judged superior to <b>Vickers,</b> while the <b>Vickers</b> fuselage was preferred. In effect, the aircraft would be built 50/50: <b>Vickers</b> the front half, EE the rear.|$|E

5|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 178, with Earnhardt leading Johnson and <b>Vickers.</b> That lap, Burton (in fifth) had a flat left {{rear tire}} and lost a lap. The field then formed a single line, with most remaining in that formation {{for the rest}} of the race. On the final lap, Johnson and <b>Vickers</b> left turn two with Johnson moving out of line to pass Earnhardt. When <b>Vickers</b> tried to move out with Johnson to provide drafting assistance, he clipped Johnson's right rear quarter panel. Johnson clipped Earnhardt, sending both drivers into the infield. The yellow flag went out and the field was frozen in place, with the order of finish determined by where the drivers were when the caution began. This gave <b>Vickers</b> the victory (the first of his career), although he was booed by the crowd.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russian Civil War {{the victorious}} Bolsheviks {{considered}} finishing Izmail, and possibly Borodino, to their original design. It would have taken at least two years to build all of Izmails turrets, even if enough guns had been available. Ten had been delivered by <b>Vickers</b> before the Revolution and one gun had been completed domestically in 1912, but the prospects that more guns could be purchased from <b>Vickers</b> or that the Soviets could make more were not promising, given the state of their heavy industry {{in the wake of the}} Civil War. Another problem was the complicated electrical system; it could not be completed under current conditions, and at least twenty months would be required to replace it with a simpler system.|$|E
5|$|All {{production}} aircraft were flight tested before delivery.

Quill devised the standard testing procedures which, with variations for specific aircraft designs, operated from 1938. Alex Henshaw, chief test pilot at Castle Bromwich from 1940, was placed in charge of testing all Spitfires built at that factory. He co-ordinated a team of 25 pilots and also assessed all Spitfire developments. Between 1940 and 1946, Henshaw flew a total of 2,360 Spitfires and Seafires, more than 10% of total production.|$|E

5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is given}} Michael's client list as a going-away present, {{much to the}} shock and envy of the other salesmen, and after losing one, {{requests}} the help of Deangelo <b>Vickers</b> (Will Ferrell) to retain them. <b>Vickers</b> nearly ruins {{a relationship with a}} client but Andy gains enough confidence to salvage the sale. Along the way, <b>Vickers</b> reveals that he was not hired for his business experience, but because he helped prevent the theft of one of Sabre CEO Jo Bennett's dogs. Meanwhile, Dwight (Rainn Wilson) is antagonistic towards Michael, still bitter over Michael not recommending him for a manager position, despite Michael's attempts to reconcile. He initially expresses disdain for Michael's going-away present, a recommendation letter, but appears touched as he reads further.

30|$|The Si-coated SiC (Si-SiC) {{composite}} nanoparticle {{was prepared}} by non-transferred arc thermal plasma processing of solid-state synthesized SiC powder {{and was used}} as a sintering additive for SiC ceramic formation. Sintered SiC pellet was prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS) process, and the effect of nano-sized Si-SiC composite particles on the sintering behavior of micron-sized SiC powder was investigated. The mixing ratio of Si-SiC composite nanoparticle to micron-sized SiC was optimized to 10  wt%. <b>Vicker’s</b> hardness and relative density was increased with increasing sintering temperature and holding time. The relative density and <b>Vicker’s</b> hardness was further increased by reaction bonding using additional activated carbon to the mixture of micron-sized SiC and nano-sized Si-SiC. The maximum relative density (97.1 %) and <b>Vicker’s</b> hardness (31.4  GPa) were recorded at 1800  °C sintering temperature for 1  min holding time, when 0.2  wt% additional activated carbon was added to the mixture of SiC/Si-SiC.|$|R
30|$|Micron-sized SiC (2 – 5  μm) powder was {{synthesized}} by a solid-state method using Si {{powder and}} activated carbon sources. Nano-sized Si-SiC composite powder, having 20 – 70  nm particle size, was prepared by non-transferred arc thermal plasma process. Sintered SiC pellets were prepared by SPS process using the mixture with different ratio of micron-sized SiC powder and nano-sized Si-SiC composite particle as a sintering additive. At a fixed ratio of micron-sized SiC and nano-sized Si-SiC (90 : 10), the relative density and <b>Vicker’s</b> hardness increased with increasing sintering temperature and holding time. The maximum relative density (88.2 %) and <b>Vicker’s</b> hardness (21.2) were recorded at 1800  °C sintering temperature for 1  min holding time. The relative density and <b>Vicker’s</b> hardness was further increased by addition of extra activated carbon to {{the mixture of}} micron-sized SiC and nano-sized Si-SiC. The relative density and <b>Vicker’s</b> hardness were increased to 97.1 % and 31.4  GPa, respectively, {{with the addition of}} 0.2  wt% of extra activated carbon to the SiC/Si-SiC mixture. It was found that the nano-size effect of Si-SiC composite particle and the exothermic nature of silicon–carbon reaction bonding were responsible for the increase in relative density and hardness. Therefore, it was suggested that the nano-sized Si-SiC composite particle could be a promising additive for sintering of SiC ceramics.|$|R
