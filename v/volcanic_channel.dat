40|$|Under the {{assumption}} of axial symmetry, the quasistationary phase of the initial stage of a volcanic eruption is modeled. The constructed model allows calculation {{of the distribution of}} the regimes of magma flow in the <b>volcanic</b> <b>channel</b> and the quasistationary distribution of a suspension of gas-dust volcanic ejections in the at-mosphere from the prescribed parameters of the magmatic source. The model can be used for evaluation of the parameters of the atmosphere above an erupting volcano, the height of a dust column during the quasis-tationary phase of eruption, the thickness of the layer of ash fallen on the earth, and other forms of action of volcanic eruptions on the environment. Introduction. A volcanic eruption {{is one of the most}} destructive types of natural disasters. We know about the horrific effects of the eruption of such volcanos as Vesuvius (A. D. 79), which destroyed the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum, Thira (formerly Santorin) (1650 B. C.), which destroyed Minoan civilization, Krakatau, which ejected about 1000 cubic kilometers of magma (1883, energy of eruption about 370 Mtons in TNT equivalent), or Mount Tambora, which took 92, 000 lives (1815, energy of eruption 25 Gtons). Although eruptions of this power usually hap...|$|E
40|$|Venusian channel meanders {{properties}} generally follow terrestrial river {{trends of}} wavelength (L) to width (W) ratios, suggesting an equilibrium adjustment of channel form. The unusually low L/W values for some sinuous rilles probably indicate modification of original meander patterns by lava-erosional channel widening. A drainage channel constructed by typical basaltic lavas can be significantly deepened and widened by highly fluid and hot superheated tholeiitic basalt or ultramafic lava to form sinuous rilles. Canali-type channels are unique {{because of their}} great lengths (up to 6800 km) and nearly constant channel cross sectional shapes along their paths. Common terrestrial-type tholeiite lava cannot sustain a superheated and turbulent state for the long distances required for thermal erosion of canali within allowable discharge rates. If canali formed mainly by constructional processes, sustained discharge rates might travel the observed distances. An exotic low-temperature, low-viscosity lava like carbonatite or sulfur seems to be required for the erosional genesis of canali. The "Outflow Channel" has a morphology {{similar to that of}} terrestrial catastrophic flood channels and Martian outflow channels. Calculated discharge rates and power/unit area imply that the channel was carved by very energetic lava flows. Valley network formation seems to require sapping processes which may be caused by low-viscosity lavas moving through a relatively permeable, fractured, medium. The close associations of many sinuous rilles with coronae leads to the hypothesis that mantle-plume volcanism caused the high-effusion and sustained lava eruptions essential for sinuous rill formation. Canali lengths exceed the lengths of other common <b>volcanic</b> <b>channel</b> types on Venus, implying a large volume of lava and long duration of the eruption. An hypothesized global resurfacing event late in history may be responsible for canali formation. Longitudinal profiles of canali-type channels show clear evidence of deformation by plains tectonism. Deformation occurred at multiple scales as evidenced in the profiles. The range of lava channel morphology on Venus is wider than for other terrestrial planets and the Moon. This is probably attributed to the volcanological conditions unique to Venus and to a lack of intense erosional processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{reported}} {{evaluation of}} Martian channel characteristics {{is based on}} Viking photographs taken from July 1976 to February 1977. The wide variation in crater densities shown by the considered Martian channels strongly implies widely differing ages for both fluviatile and lava channels. Attention is given to age determination methodology, a description of channels and implications for channel formation, surface water under present Martian conditions, surface water under more favorable Martian conditions in the past, channel parameter estimates, and <b>volcanic</b> <b>channels...</b>|$|R
40|$|During {{the period}} {{just prior to}} an earthquake, an electomagnetic {{emission}} develops over seismic zones. In this paper, a model of excitation of magnetic fields over zones of volcanic activity is proposed. Movement of magma along <b>volcanic</b> <b>channels</b> precedes an earthquake, hydrodynamic processes in the moving magma can lead to formation of waves and vortices in the flow which, in turn, can cause development of magnetic fields in conducting magma. During this period, {{the movement of the}} magma intensifies leading to a corresponding intensification of the magnetic fields. In this paper, different possible sources of ULF pulsation in magma are examined,and the variable geomagnetic fields induced by this pulsation are estimated...|$|R

40|$|Hecates Tholus is {{a volcano}} {{located at the}} Elysium {{volcanic}} province in the Martian lowlands (32 ºN, 210 ºW). In addition to several nested calderas, the volcano shows several geological and geomorphological features that could be indicative of a complex <b>volcanic</b> evolution: <b>channels,</b> depressions, pits, faults and ridges, and a complex volcano topography. The processes that can explain the structural evolution of the volcano, include: (1) volcanic spreading, (2) lateral volcanic activity, (3) development of large landslides, (4) hydrothermal activity, and (5) tectonic deformation. We discuss these hypotheses and their implications, {{in order to establish}} the most feasible volcanic history of Hecates Tholu...|$|R

The pictures represent {{only a small fraction}} of the many thousands taken, and were chosen to illustrate the diverse geology of Mars and its atmospheric phenomena. Specific topics discussed include the Viking mission and its objectives, a brief comparison of Earth and Mars, and surface features of Mars including the great equatorial canyons, <b>channels,</b> <b>volcanic</b> and deformational features, and craters.

40|$|Mars {{data sets}} {{from many sources}} have been put into a common digital format and global maps at {{constant}} scale have been produced. These formatted data sets {{form the basis of}} the Mars Consortium. They currently include maps of geology, <b>volcanic</b> units, <b>channels,</b> wind features, topography, gravity, Viking approach and apoapsis color, predawn temperature residuals, thermal inertia, radiometric and solar albedo, water vapor abundance, 1. 4 micrometers albedo, crater abundance, Earth-based radar and photographic telescope observations, and terrestrial spectral observations. The generation of these data sets is briefly described. As an example of their use, the mapped geologic units are characterized in terms of color, predawn temperature and elevation, and unusual areas identified. The Oxia Palus region is examined as an example of combining higher resolution data with the Consortium data sets. Use of the existing data sets and submission of new ones are encouraged...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} of channels, inner terraces, and delta-like features with Martian impact craters {{has previously been}} interpreted as evidence {{in favor of the}} past existence of crater lakes on Mars. However, examination of a candidate crater-lake system in western Memnonia suggests instead that its features may have formed through igneous processes involving the flow and ponding of lava. Accumulations of material in craters and other topographic lows throughout much of the study region have characteristics consistent with those of volcanic deposits, and terraces found along the inner flanks of some of these craters are interpreted as having formed through drainage or subsidence of <b>volcanic</b> materials. <b>Channels</b> previously identified as inlets and outlets of the crater-lake system are interpreted instead as volcanic rilles. These results challenge previous interpretations of terrace and channel features in the study region and suggest that candidate crater lakes located elsewhere should be reexamined...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} unique landforms around the head. Immediately {{in front of}} the head there is a rock {{platform}} which was formed in the Permian to Triassic periods around 180 - 280 million years ago. In the platform there is a <b>volcanic</b> intrusion, a <b>channel</b> of darker rock running {{from one side of the}} platform to the other. The intrusion was created by waves quarrying a softer basalt lava flow out of the surrounding granite. The lava came from an ancient volcano, probably Mount Warrawolong to the west.|$|R
40|$|Several {{alternative}} {{models were}} {{proposed for the}} origin and mode of formation of channels and valley networks on Martian volcanoes, notably Hecates Tholus, Ceraunius Tholus, and Alba Patera. Early interpretations of Mariner 9 and Viking images suggested that these features on Alba were lava channels, while those on Ceraunius Tholus were interpreted as fluvial or <b>volcanic</b> debris <b>channels.</b> Subsequent mapping of Tyrrehna Patera and Hecate Tholus has suggested that pyroclastic activity may have characterized eruptions on these volcanoes, and that at least for Hecates the channels were probably formed by fluvial erosion of unconsolidated ash deposits on the flanks of the volcano. As part of a continuing program {{to better understand the}} eruptive history of the young volcanic centers on Mars, numerous channels were identified on the flanks of Alba Patera that resemble the channels on Hecates. As a result, the possibility is being explored that some of the small channels on the flanks of Alba Patera may be fluvial in origin and potentail water sources and modes of formation are being explored...|$|R
40|$|An updated map is {{presented}} {{which shows the}} distribution of more than 200 channels and valleys on Venus. A large number of channels are concentrated in equatorial regions characterized by highlands, rift and fracture zones, an associated <b>volcanic</b> features. Many <b>channels</b> associated with flow deposits are similar to typical terrestrial lava drainage channels. They {{are associated with a}} wide range of volcanic edifices. More than half of the sinuous rilles are associated with coronae, coronalike features, or arachnoids. Corona volcanism driven by mantle plume events may explain this association. Many valley network are observed in highlands and in association with coronae, coronalike features, or arachnoids. This indicates that highlands and coronae provided fractures and flow-viscosity lavas, both of which seem to be required for network formation by lava sapping processes. Canali-type channels have a unique distribution limited to some plains regions...|$|R
40|$|Regions near Apollinaris Patera are {{proposed}} for consideration as Mars Surveyor landing sites. Gulick (1998) proposed this region at the First Mars Surveyor Landing Site workshop; Bulmer and Gregg (1998) provided additional support. Apollinaris Patera is {{situated on the}} highlands/lowlands boundary at 8. 5 S, 186 W. The volcano itself has been mapped as Hesperian in age. The regions surrounding Apollinaris show evidence for volcanism, volcano-ice interactions, and erosion by water. Numerous valleys modified by fluvial processes dissect a large fan structure emanating from the southern flank of the volcano. Sapping valleys have formed along the southern terminus of the fan structure. Regions near Apollinaris Patera provide {{a unique opportunity to}} sample outcrop lithologies ranging from highland Noachian basement rocks, to Hesperian aged lava flows, channel and flood plain materials, to Amazonian <b>volcanic,</b> ash and <b>channel</b> deposits...|$|R
40|$|Observations of sinuous and {{branching}} channels on planets {{have long}} driven {{a debate about}} their origin, fluvial or volcanic processes. In some cases planetary conditions rule out fluvial activity (e. g. the Moon, Venus, Mercury). However, the geology of Mars leads to suggestions that liquid water existed on the surface in the past. As a result, some sinuous and branching channels on Mars are cited as evidence of fluvial erosion. Evidence for a fluvial history often focuses on channel morphologies that are unique from a typical lava channel, for instance, a lack of detectable flow margins and levees, islands and terraces. Although these features are typical, they are not necessarily diagnostic of a fluvial system. We conducted field studies in Hawaii to characterize similar features in lava flows to better define which characteristics might be diagnostic of fluvial or volcanic processes. Our martian example is a channel system that originates in the Ascraeus Mons SW rift zone from a fissure. The channel extends for approx. 300 km to the SE/E. The proximal channel displays multiple branches, islands, terraces, and has no detectable levees or margins. We conducted field work on the 1859 and 1907 Mauna Loa flows, and the Pohue Bay flow. The 51 -km-long 1859 Flow originates from a fissure and {{is an example of}} a paired a a and pahoehoe lava flow. We collected DGPS data across a 500 m long island. Here, the channel diverted around a pre-existing obstruction in the channel, building vertical walls up to 9 m in height above the current channel floor. The complicated emplacement history along this channel section, including an initial a a stage partially covered by pahoehoe overflows, resulted in an appearance of terraced channel walls, no levees and diffuse flow margins. The 1907 Mauna Loa flow extends > 20 km from the SW rift zone. The distal flow formed an a a channel. However the proximal flow field comprises a sheet that experienced drainage and sagging of the crust following the eruption. The lateral margins of the proximal sheet, past which all lava flowed to feed the extensive channel, currently display a thickness of < 20 cm. Were this area covered by a dust layer, as is the Tharsis region on Mars, the margins would be difficult to identify. The Pohue Bay flow forms a lava tube. Open roof sections experienced episodes of overflow and spill out. In several places the resultant surface flows appear to have moved as sheet flows that inundated the preexisting meter scale features. Here the flows developed pathways around topographic highs, and in so doing accreted lava onto those features. The results are small islands within the multiple branched channels that display steep, sometimes overhanging walls. None of these features alone proves that the martian channel networks are the result of volcanic processes, but analog studies such as these are the first step towards identifying which morphologies are truly diagnostic of fluvial and <b>volcanic</b> <b>channels...</b>|$|R
5000|$|An active vent at {{the edge}} of the lake is a source of {{elemental}} sulfur, and supports a mining operation. Escaping <b>volcanic</b> gases are <b>channelled</b> through a network of ceramic pipes, resulting in condensation of molten sulfur. The sulphur, which is deep red in colour when molten, pours slowly from the ends of these pipes and pools on the ground, turning bright yellow as it cools. The miners break the cooled material into large pieces and carry it away in baskets. Miners carry loads ranging from 75 kg to 90 kg, up 300 m to the crater rim, with a gradient of 45 to 60 degrees and then 3 kilometres (1.86 miles) down the mountain for weighing. Most miners make this journey twice a day. A nearby sulfur refinery pays the miners by the weight of sulfur transported; as of September 2010, the typical daily earnings were equivalent to approximately $13 US. The miners often receive insufficient protection while working around the volcano [...] and complain of numerous respiratory afflictions. There are 200 miners, who extract 14 tons per day - about 20 percent of the continuous daily deposit.|$|R
40|$|In the Sicily <b>Channel,</b> <b>volcanic</b> {{activity}} has been concentrated {{mainly on the}} Pantelleria and Linosa islands, while minor submarine volcanism {{took place in the}} Adventure, Graham and Nameless banks. The volcanic activity spanned mostly during Plio-Pleistocene, however, historical submarine eruptions occurred in 1831 on the Graham Bank and in 1891 offshore Pantelleria Island. On the Graham Bank, 25 miles SW of Sciacca, the 1831 eruption formed the short-lived Ferdinandea Island that represents the only Italian volcano active in historical times currently almost completely unknown and not yet monitored. Moreover, most of the Sicily Channel seismicity is concentrated along a broad NS belt extending from the Graham Bank to Lampedusa Island. In 2012, the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) carried out a multidisciplinary oceanographic cruise, named “Ferdinandea 2012 ”, the preliminary results of which represent the aim of this paper. The cruise goal was the mapping of the morpho-structural features of some submarine volcanic centres located in the northwestern side of the Sicily Channel and the temporary recording of their seismic and degassing activity. During the cruise, three OBS/Hs (ocean bottom seismometer with hydrophone) were deployed near the Graham, Nerita and Terribile submarine banks. During the following 9 months they have recorded several seismo-acoustic signals produced by both tectonic and volcanic sources. A high-resolution bathymetric survey was achieved on the Graham Bank and on the surrounding submarine volcanic centres. A widespread and voluminous gas bubbles emission was observed by both multibeam sonar echoes and a ROV (remotely operated vehicle) along the NW side of the Graham Bank, where gas and seafloor samples were also collected...|$|R
