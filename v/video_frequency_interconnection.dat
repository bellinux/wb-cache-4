50|$|The {{physical}} {{design of}} D-sub connectors is ill-suited for consumer plug-and-play applications. Thin metal pins, especially in higher-density connectors, are easily bent or broken, particularly if frequently plugged in by touch behind equipment. The need to tighten screws for a secure connection is cumbersome. There {{is a high}} risk of shorting the male pins with the mating connector's surrounding lip as well. Although ESD- and EMI-resistant D-sub connectors exist, the fundamental design was never intended to protect from electrostatic discharge or electromagnetic interference or facilitate very high <b>frequency</b> <b>interconnections.</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the optimal wiresizing problem under the {{distributed}} Elmore delay model. We {{show that the}} optimal wiresizing solutions satisfy a number of interesting properties, including the separability, the monotone property, and the dominance property. Based on these properties, we develop a polynomial-time optimal wiresizing algorithm for arbitrary interconnect structures under the distributed Elmore delay model. Extensive experimental results show that our wiresizing solution reduces interconnection delay by up to 51 % {{when compared to the}} uniform-width solution of the same routing topology. Furthermore, compared to the wiresizing solution based on a simpler RC delay model in [7], our wiresizing solution reduces the total wiring area by up to 28 % while further reducing the interconnection delays to the timing-critical sinks by up to 12 %. 1 Introduction As the VLSI fabrication technology reaches submicron device dimension and gigahertz <b>frequency,</b> <b>interconnection</b> delay has [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a multistage interconnection network (MIN) with regular interconnections {{in three dimensions}} (two space dimensions and the third dimension is the frequency) and dimension-dependent switches. (Regular interconnections mean that the same interconnection principles are applied throughout the stages of the MIN.) The frequency domain is organized by introducing artificial dimensions. The architecture is interpreted as an optical frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system with multidimensional interconnections and switches where the dimension is an additional design parameter. The multidimensional interconnections may be implemented {{using a combination of}} space and frequency channels. The <b>frequency</b> <b>interconnections</b> (data movements between channels) are expressed by the Kronecker product (KP) of permutation matrices. In this case the number of frequency conversion (FC) operations and the number of frequency channels crossed during the generation of interconnections and switching decreases. The architectural principles presented are of general interest for the study of transmission and processing in arbitrary large scale interconnection systems implemented in the 3 -D physical space...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} meet {{stringent}} specifications of bandwidth flatness, differential gain and phase, and 75 Ω drive capability, high speed complementary bipolar processes are more suitable than CMOS processes for video switches and multiplexers. Traditional CMOS switches and multiplexers suffer from several disadvantages at <b>video</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Their switching time (typically 50 ns or so) is not fast enough for today's video applications, and they require external buffering in order to drive typical video loads. In addition, the small variation of the CMOS switch on-resistance with signal level (RON modulation) introduces unwanted distortion in differential gain and phase. Multiplexers based on complementary bipolar technology offer a better solution at <b>video</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The tradeoffs, of course, are higher power and cost. Functional block diagrams of the AD 8170 /AD 8174 /AD 8180 /AD 8182 bipolar video multiplexer are shown in Figure 1. The AD 8183 /AD 8185 video multiplexer is shown in Figure 2. These devices offer {{a high degree of}} flexibility and are ideally suited to video applications, with excellent differential gain and phase specifications. Switching time for all devices in the family is 10 ns to 0. 1 %. The AD 8186 /AD 8187 are single-supply versions of the AD 8183 /AD 8185.

This method was adopted, with crossover frequencies for the emphasis/de-emphasis at 5.2 MHz for Y and 1.6 MHz for C.
