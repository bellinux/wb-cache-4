5000|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, vulcanization is {{a necessary}} step to prepare the uncured silicone mold for spin casting production. Under controlled heat and pressure the silicone slowly cures to a heat-resistant, flexible, permanent mold. The vulcanizing press or <b>vulcanizer</b> uniformly compresses the mold while exposing it to high temperature {{over a period of}} several hours. The <b>vulcanizer</b> consists of a pair of parallel heated platens mounted on a hydraulic press. Smaller or home-made vulcanizers may compress the mold via screws or a heavy duty clamp instead of hydraulic pressure. Some spin casting operations choose to forgo running their own <b>vulcanizer</b> and instead contract out their mold production.|$|E

At this point, the foam form can be de-molded and sent to a washing step. Typical molding cycles are 60 minutes. After washing, the foam form is introduced into the <b>vulcanizer</b> stage to complete the cross-linking process. The final step is the drying process where residual moisture is driven off.|$|E

25|$|Rubber cements are {{solutions}} {{of synthetic}} or natural rubber products in solvents, {{with or without}} resins and gums. <b>Vulcanizers,</b> accelerators, and stabilizers are considered problematic {{due to the nature}} of their compounds. One example is the additive of sulfur which is harmful to some types of material, including silver, because it can cause discoloration. Rubber adhesives can be confused with epoxy resins due to their similar appearance. However, unlike epoxy resins, rubber adhesives will stretch when pulled. Nitromors or Polystrippa solvent brands are used as a solvent but warm water can also loosen the bond.|$|R

The spin casting machine has been constructed in UAJY in 2007, {{but it did not}} use the cured silicon rubber already. It was applied to RTV silicone rubber. The experimental works showed that using uncured silicone rubber in spin casting tend to produce inappropriate shape of products because of its elasticity.

40|$|Resumo: Esta pesquisa trata da caracterização e comparação entre as principais borrachas naturais utilizadas em pneumáticos, GEB- 1, STR, SMR- 20 e RSS- 3, utilizando-se um único composto e alterando-se apenas a borracha. A caracterização e comparação foram feitas medindo-se as propriedades mecânicas (dinamométricas), reométricas, queima, viscosidade, densidade e dureza. O composto estudado foi uma mistura típica contendo borracha natural, negro de fumo, óleo plastificante, auxiliares de processamento, antioxidantes, adesivante, acelerante e vulcanizante, todos numa quantidade pré-estabelecida. Antes de iniciar o trabalho de mistura dos compostos do estudo, foi realizada a caracterização das borrachas utilizadas. Desta caracterização, a borracha RSS- 3 (Ribbed Smoked Sheet) se difere das demais principalmente pela viscosidade e pelo PRI que são maiores. As borrachas SMR- 20, GEB- 1 e STR são semelhantes e no composto final isto pôde ser observado. Na análise dinamométrica, o módulo de alongamento à 100 % e tensão de ruptura foram mais altos para o composto com a borracha RSS- 3, porém com menor dispersão em comparação às demais. A Borracha GEB- 1 apresentou um desvio padrão maior entre as várias análises efetuadas. O alongamento à ruptura ficou menor com a borracha RSS- 3. A borracha RSS- 3 conferiu maior viscosidade ao composto final, já esperado uma vez que sua viscosidade e PRI são maiores que as outras três borrachas estudadas. Concluindo que para obtenção dos mesmos valores de viscosidade, que é um parâmetro importante no processamento do composto, o ciclo de confecção deste composto deveria ser alterado, para isto é aconselhado um novo estudo. Para todas as borrachas a densidade apresentou valores semelhantes, com dispersão também uniforme, concluindo que a mistura dos compostos em todos os casos estavam homogêneas e que o ciclo de confecção utilizado foi suficiente para garantir a boa mistura. A partir dos resultados obtidos conclui-se que nos períodos de entre-safra pode-se utilizar outras borrachas em substituição à indisponível, desde que o ciclo de confecção seja alterado e que uma pequena alteração das características do composto final sejam permitidasAbstract: The present {{research}} concerns the characterization and comparison among the main natural rubber used in tires, GEB- 1, STR, SMR- 20 and RSS- 3, utilizing one compound and altering only the rubber. Both characterization and comparison {{were made by}} measuring the mechanical properties (dynamometric, rheometric, burning, viscosity, density and hardness). The studied compound was a typical mixture containing natural rubber, carbon black, plasticizing oil, processing auxiliaries, antioxidants, adhesives, accelerants and <b>vulcanizer,</b> all in a specific pre-established quantity. Prior to initiating {{the process of the}} mixture of the compounds, a characterization of the used rubbers was carried out. In the course of this characterization it was observed that the RSS- 3 rubber (Ribbed Smoked Sheet) differs from the others, mainly due to its viscosity and by the PRI, which are higher. The MST- 20, GEB- 1 and STR rubbers are similar, fact which was observed in the final composition. In the dynamometric analysis, the stretch module at 100 % and load of rupture were higher for the RSS- 3 compound, although with a lower dispersion if compared with the other rubbers. The GEB- 1 rubber presented a standard deviation, the highest among the several analyses that were performed. The stretch to the rupture was lower with the RSS- 3 rubber. The RSS- 3 rubber presented more viscosity to the final composition, which was expected since its viscosity and PRI are higher then the other three studied rubbers. Therefore, in order to obtain the same values of viscosity, which is an important parameter in the compound process, the cycle of confection of this compound must be altered. Such alteration would require a new study. The density presented similar results to all rubbers, also with a uniform dispersion, concluding that the mixture of the compounds in all cases were homogenous and that the cycle utilized was sufficient to guarantee a good mixture. From the obtained results one concludes that during the between-harvest seasons one can use other rubbers as a substitution to the available one, as long as the cycle of confection is modified and that a small alteration of the characteristic of the final composition be allowe...|$|E
