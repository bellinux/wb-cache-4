5|$|In the {{seemingly}} empty city, Rick follows a helicopter flying overhead {{right into a}} horde of zombies. They attack his horse, forcing him to drop his bag of weapons and take shelter in a tank.

5|$|Gerry Anderson biographers Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn {{suggest that}} Thunderbird 6 {{develops}} {{the character of}} Lady Penelope from her previous appearances in the Thunderbirds franchise. This is argued to be due, in part, to a more mature reading of the character's lines from Sylvia Anderson, who provided Penelope's <b>voice</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first episode of the Thunderbirds television series. Archer and Hearn also praise the work of David Graham, particularly his reading of Parker's dialogue, but note that other regular characters, such as Gordon and John, appear infrequently in the film.|$|E
5|$|Seasons {{begins as}} the Triforce {{calls out to}} Link from within Hyrule Castle. Link {{approaches}} it, and is transported to a dark forest where he encounters a traveling group led by a dancer named Din. After Din welcomes Link to Holodrum, the sky becomes covered in black clouds. A <b>voice</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> clouds calls Din the Oracle of Seasons and refers to himself as Onox, General of Darkness. A funnel cloud drops from the sky, taking Din into its dark heights. As the tornado dissipates, the seasons of Holodrum fall into disarray and change rapidly.|$|E

5|$|Mysore was the {{location}} of the first private radio broadcasting station in India when Akashavani (<b>voice</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sky) was established in the city on 10 September 1935 by M.V. Gopalaswamy, a professor of psychology, at his house in the Vontikoppal area of Mysore, using a 50-watt transmitter. The station was taken over by the princely state of Mysore in 1941 and was moved to Bangalore in 1955. In 1957, Akashvani was chosen as the official name of All India Radio (AIR), the radio broadcaster of the Government of India. The AIR station at Mysore broadcasts an FM radio channel at 100.6MHz, and Gyan Vani broadcasts on 105.2. BIG FM and Red FM are the two private FM channels operating in the city.|$|E
25|$|The first {{opera house}} was opened in 1810 and {{destroyed}} by fire in 1873. The modern building was constructed by Fellner & Helmer in neo-baroque (Vienna Baroque) style and opened in 1887. The {{architecture of the}} luxurious audience hall follows the late French rococo style. The unique acoustics of the horseshoe-designed hall allows to deliver even a whisper-low tone of <b>voice</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stage to {{any part of the}} hall.

25|$|Charlie's Angels is a 2000 American action comedy film {{based on}} the Charlie's Angels 1976 {{original}} television series.

The film was directed by McG, adapted by screenwriters Ryan Rowe, Ed Solomon, and John August, and starring Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu as three women working in a private detective agency in Los Angeles. John Forsythe reprised {{his role as the}} unseen Charlie's <b>voice</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original series. Making cameo appearances are Tom Green (who was dating Barrymore at the time of production) and LL Cool J.|$|E

25|$|A pilot cutter {{cruising}} in {{the vicinity}} of Lundy Island had encountered Montagu a short time earlier. The battleship had stopped engines, come abreast, and hailed from the bridge requesting a distance and bearing for Hartland Point on the mainland of England. Though the cutter supplied these accurately, the <b>voice</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> battleships bridge replied that they must be wrong and that the pilot cutter must have lost her bearings. As Montagu restarted her engines and began to move ahead, the cutter shouted back that on her present course Montagu would be on Shutter Rock within ten minutes, and a short time later the sound of the battleship running aground carried through the fog.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, on the {{occasion}} of the festival of Eid ul-Adha, he is said to have delivered an hour-long sermon extempore in Arabic expounding the meaning and philosophy of sacrifice. This episode is celebrated as one of the important events of the history of Ahmadiyya. The sermon was simultaneously written down by two of his companions and came to be known as the Khutba Ilhamiyya, the revealed or inspired sermon. Ahmadiyya literature states that during this sermon, there was a change in his voice, he appeared as if in a trance, in the grip of an unseen hand, and as if a <b>voice</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> unknown had made him its mouthpiece. After the sermon ended, Ahmad fell into prostration, followed by the rest of the congregation, as a sign of gratitude towards God.|$|E
25|$|The sadhaka {{may also}} meditate on a deity. Offerings to the deity {{are put in}} the corpse's mouth. The {{practitioner}} may perform pranayama and meditate on his guru and the deity in his mind. He can also practice japa (repetition of a mantra or a deity's names or epithets), till the corpse promises him to grant his wish. He may encounter an Akashavani (a <b>voice</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> skies) which may try to tempt him with material things. He will experience terrifying visions and sounds as well as temptations; however the practitioner should remain untouched and concentrate on the meditation. On conducting the rite successfully, the sadhaka would be blessed with mantra-siddhi (a supernatural power to use a mantra) or become one with Shiva. Uniting with Shiva is said to lead to detachment, a characteristic of the ascetic god. Shiva is himself equated with shava, the corpse. As the vessel of Shiva, the adept becomes an avadhuta, a mystic who is beyond egoic-consciousness, duality and common worldly concerns. The Tantrasara says that a voice may ask for more offerings or bless the practitioner by granting his wishes.|$|E

25|$|ACM {{started working}} with the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES) to create {{traveling}} exhibitions, which were the first major African American themed exhibitions at the Smithsonian. In 1977 the exhibition The Anacostia Story exhibited {{the history of the}} neighborhood from 1608 to 1930. Frederick Douglass, who lived in Anacostia, was the focus of The Frederick Douglass Years. The 1979 exhibition Out of Africa: From West African Kingdoms to Colonization was the first {{to make use of the}} museum's budding permanent collection, and Chancellor Williams lectured. The museum closed for little over two months in, from November until January, 1980, re-opening with the exhibition Anna J. Cooper: A <b>Voice</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> South. To celebrate the centennial of the birth of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Smithsonian organized an institution wide series of events, with ACN organizing Mary McLeod Bethune and Roosevelt's Black Cabinet. Mercer Ellington, the son of Duke Ellington, filmed a public service announcement for the exhibition The Renaissance: Black Arts of the '20s. ACM focused on Washington, D.C.'s role in equal and civil rights in To Achieve These Rights: The Struggle for Equal Rights and Self-Determination in the District of Columbia, 1791-1978. The Washington region was a focus again with Footsteps from North Brentwood, which discussed the history of Prince George's County, Maryland.|$|E
