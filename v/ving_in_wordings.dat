Adult patients treated for sepsis or septic shock with acute kidney injury (AKI) and patients undergoing elective pharyngolaryngeal or orthopedic surgery were enrolled. IAP was measured in the urinary bladder. Total body water (TBW), extracellular water content (ECW) and volume excess (VE) were measured by whole body bioimpedance. Among critically ill patients, all parameters were analyzed over three consecutive days, and parameters were evaluated perioperatively in surgical patients. One hundred twenty patients were studied. Taken together, the correlations between IAP and VE, TBW, and ECW were measured at 408 time points.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the inhibitory effect of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) on antidiuretic hormone (ADH) -stimulated net Cl- absorption and spontaneous transepithelial voltage (<b>Ve)</b> <b>in</b> single medullary thick ascending limbs of Henle (TALH, thick ascending limb; mTALH, medullary segment; cTALH, cortical segment) obtained from mouse kidney. The experimental {{data indicate that}} PGE 2 reduced the ADH-dependent values of net Cl- absorption (JnetCl, eq cm- 2 s- 1) and <b>Ve</b> (mV) <b>in</b> a dose-dependent manner; that increasing concentrations of peritubular ADH reversed the PGE 2 -mediated reductions in the ADH-dependent moiety of <b>Ve</b> <b>in</b> the mouse mTALH; that PGE 2 {{had no effect on}} cyclic AMP-stimulated increments <b>in</b> <b>Ve</b> <b>in</b> the mouse mTALH; and that PGE 2 had no effect on <b>Ve</b> <b>in</b> the cTALH, where Ve is unaffected either by ADH or by cyclic AMP. These effects might be obtained because of a direct competition between ADH and PGE 2 for receptor binding on basolateral membranes. Alternatively, PGE 2 might have reduced the affinities between ADH-receptor units and a component(s) of the series of processes leading to adenyl cyclase activation. The latter argument requires that basolateral membranes of the mouse mTALH exhibit receptor reserve, i. e., at the minimum concentration of ADH required to enhance Ve and JnetCl maximally, a fraction of basolateral membrane ADH receptors were unoccupied. According to this view, increasing peritubular ADH concentrations might reverse the PGE 2 -mediated reduction in ADH-dependent salt transport by increasing the number of basolateral membrane receptors occupied by ADH...|$|R

Six healthy male volunteers undertook about of sub-maximal (100 W) and maximal (sprint ca. 350 W) exercise on a cycle ergometer. VE was measured breath-by-breath and arterial blood was sampled at regular intervals from a catheter inserted into a brachial artery for measurement of [K+]a and base excess. Changes in [K+]a closely mirrored changes <b>in</b> <b>VE</b> during exercise and recovery. At 100 W [K+]a increased from 4 mM to 5 mM, and during the sprint [K+]a increased to ca. 7 mM. Base excess did not mirror <b>VE</b> <b>in</b> that it reached its nadir 1 - 3 min after exercise had stopped, when [K+]a and VE were both falling. The increases in [K+]a seen here are probably sufficient to enhance the arterial chemoreceptor drive during exercise. Furthermore, the close temporal relationship between [K+]a and VE suggests that it is possible that exercise hyperkalaemia may contribute to the control of breathing in exercise...|$|R
