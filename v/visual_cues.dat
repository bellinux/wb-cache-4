40|$|Currently, touch {{panels are}} used in many devices, {{and there have been}} many {{proposals}} to add tactile sensation to touch panels, which require additional electro-mechanical components. In this paper, we propose a simple method of adding a tactile sensation of a ridge, using just a thin sheet. The sheet has ridges that are haptically imperceptible, but once a <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> such as a line is presented, visuotactile cross-modal response induces a haptic ridge. We tested the effects of the <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> and height of the ridge. The result showed that the <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> definitely enhances feeling of a ridge...|$|R
40|$|These {{experiments}} {{examined the}} effects of dorsomedial striatal inactivation on the acquisition of a response and <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> discrimination task, as well as a shift from a response to a <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> discrimination, and vice versa. In Experiment 1, rats were tested on the response discrimination task followed by the <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> discrimination task. In Experiment 2, the testing order was reversed. Infusions of 2 % tetracaine did not impair acquisition of the response or <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> discrimination but impaired performance when shifting from a response to a <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> discrimination, and vice versa. Analysis of the errors revealed that the deficit was not due to perseveration of the previously learned strategy, but to an inability to maintain the new strategy. These results contrast with findings indicating that prelimbic inactivation impairs behavioral flexibility due to perseveration of a previously learned strategy. Thus, specific circuits in the prefrontal cortex and striatum may interact to enable behavioral flexibility, but each region may contribute to distinct processes that facilitate strategy switching. There have been several different theories regarding the function of the striatum in learning and memory over the past severa...|$|R
40|$|Wrappers are tools used {{to extract}} {{relevant}} information from HTML pages. Current approaches use DOM tree, <b>visual</b> <b>cue,</b> and ontology to extract data. DOM tree based techniques are fast and simple. However, {{they are not}} as accurate as visual based wrappers due to lack of additional information needed to perform data extraction. Visual based wrappers, on the other hand, are slow due to the extra processing needed to obtain <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> from the underlying browser rendering engine. Ontology based wrappers are accurate, but they are also slow and need manual tuning to operate them. In this paper, we propose a novel visual based wrapper to extract information from HTML pages. Our wrapper uses <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> to eliminate unnecessary regions, hence reduces the running time of extraction task as our wrapper only needs to consider the relevant region for extraction. Then, our wrapper removes irrelevant data from the relevant region using <b>visual</b> <b>cue.</b> Experiment results show that our wrapper outperforms state-of-the-art wrapper WISH in data extraction...|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that aposematism and mimicry is less evident in marine invertebrates than terrestrial insects because predation is a more intense selective force for many insects, which also disperse as adults rather than as larvae and have much shorter generation times.

40|$|Here {{we provide}} fMRI data used for MVPA in the {{following}} project (for details see data description file) : Gertz H, Lingnau A and Fiehler K (2017). Decoding Movement Goals from the Fronto-Parietal Reach Network. Front. Hum. Neurosci. 11 : 84. doi: 10. 3389 /fnhum. 2017. 00084 During reach planning, fronto-parietal brain areas need to transform sensory information into a motor code. It is debated whether these areas maintain a sensory representation of the <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> or a motor representation of the upcoming movement goal. Here, we present results from a delayed pro-/anti-reach task which allowed for dissociating {{the position of the}} <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> from the reach goal. In this task, the <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> was combined with a context rule (pro vs. anti) to infer the movement goal. Different levels of movement goal specification during the delay were obtained by presenting the context rule either before the delay together with the <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> (specified movement goal) or after the delay (underspecified movement goal). By applying fMRI multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) we demonstrate movement goal encoding in the left dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and bilateral superior parietal lobule (SPL) when the reach goal is specified. This suggests that fronto-parietal reach regions maintain a prospective motor code during reach planning. When the reach goal is underspecified, only area PMd but not SPL represents the <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> position indicating an incomplete state of sensorimotor integration. Moreover, this result suggests a potential role of PMd in movement goal selection...|$|R
5|$|After 400–500 {{accumulated}} degree-days above , adults {{begin to}} emerge from trees in late spring, and peak emergence occurs around 1000 degree-days. After emergence, adults feed for one week on ash leaves in the canopy before mating, but cause little defoliation in the process. Males hover around trees, locate females by <b>visual</b> <b>cues,</b> and drop directly onto the female to mate; mating can last 50 minutes, and females may mate with multiple males over their lifespan. A typical female can live around six weeks and lay approximately 40–70 eggs, but females that live longer can lay up to 200 eggs.|$|E
5|$|Banded sugar ants {{will often}} attack the nests of other ant species at random, while {{ignoring}} other ants nearby. They use their mandibles to hold opponents, and use formic acid to kill them. Foraging workers use <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> {{to help them}} find their way around, or to let them determine that they are lost; workers will identify landmarks they are familiar with to orientate themselves. When provoked, an individual banded sugar ant will lift up its abdomen and use its large mandibles to fend off an attacker. If further provoked, it can defend itself by spraying formic acid from its abdomen to deter predators.|$|E
5|$|Several of Necrid's attacks {{duplicate}} physical {{motions and}} properties of attacks used by other {{characters in the}} series. However, each attack causes his weapon to extend from then retract into his hands, resulting in different <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> than the move they derive from. Some attacks combine elements of two other existing character moves; for example, Dragon Blaze begins with one attack used by Maxi and ends with another from Nightmare. Despite this fact some moves are unique to Necrid's repertoire, such as Elder Topaz, an attack stance that allows {{the use of an}} altered set of attacks for a short time, and Void Cannon, which creates a small explosion on the ground at varying distances from Necrid.|$|E

40|$|In three experiments, rats {{received}} a successive, auditory discrimination in which presentations of the reinforced stimulus, the S +, were followed after a 30 -s trace interval by {{the delivery of}} the reinforcer (footshock). Of primary interest was the effect on discrimination learning of presenting a visual stimulus immediately after each auditory cue. In Experiment 1, a 30 -s <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> retarded {{the development of the}} discrimination. This effect was taken to reflect the fact that the <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> had acquired associative strength by virtue of its temporal contiguity with reinforcement on reinforced trials. In Experiments 2 A and 2 B, the duration of the visual stimulus was reduced to 10 s and 1 s, respectively. The visual stimulus had little impact on discrimination learning in Experiment 2 A, but facilitated learning in Experiment 2 B. This facilitation was, in large measure, a consequence of the <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> reducing the extent of generalized responding on nonreinforced S− trials. It is argued that the presence of the <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> in Experiment 2 B disrupts the development of associations between the unique and common elements of the discriminanda that would otherwise mediate generalization between them, and the implication of this interpretation for the notion of "marking" is discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{number of}} {{chromosomes}} per individual varies {{from one to}} over 70 among the species in the genus. The genome of M. pilosula is contained on {{a single pair of}} chromosomes (males have just one chromosome, as they are haploid). This is the lowest number possible for any animal, and workers of this species are homologous. Like M. pilosula, M. croslandi also contains a single chromosome. While these ants only have a single chromosome, M. pyriformis contains 41 chromosomes while M. brevinoda contains 42. The chromosome count for M. piliventris and M. fulvipes is 2 and 12, respectively. The genus Myrmecia retains many traits that are considered basal for all ants (i.e. workers foraging alone and relying on <b>visual</b> <b>cues).</b>|$|E
5|$|Most ants are univoltine, {{producing}} {{a new generation}} each year. During the species-specific breeding period, new reproductives, females, and winged males leave the colony in {{what is called a}} nuptial flight. The nuptial flight usually takes place in the late spring or early summer when the weather is hot and humid. Heat makes flying easier and freshly fallen rain makes the ground softer for mated queens to dig nests. Males typically take flight before the females. Males then use <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> to find a common mating ground, for example, a landmark such as a pine tree to which other males in the area converge. Males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow. Males will mount females in the air, but the actual mating process usually takes place on the ground. Females of some species mate with just one male but in others they may mate with as many as ten or more different males, storing the sperm in their spermathecae.|$|E
5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} and button to input commands, though home versions use a game controller with a directional pad.

Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time. During these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} investigated how perceptual, structural, and lexical cues affect structural choices during English transitive sentence production. Participants described transitive events under {{combinations of}} <b>visual</b> <b>cueing</b> of attention (toward either agent or patient) and structural priming {{with and without}} semantic match between the notional verb in the prime and the target event. Speakers had a stronger preference for passive-voice sentences (1) when their attention was directed to the patient, (2) upon reading a passive-voice prime, and (3) when the verb in the prime matched the target event. The verb-match effect was the by-product of an interaction between <b>visual</b> <b>cueing</b> and verb match: {{the increase in the}} proportion of passive-voice responses with matching verbs was limited to the agent-cued condition. Persistence of <b>visual</b> <b>cueing</b> effects in the presence of both structural and lexical cues suggests a strong coupling between referent-directed visual attention and Subject assignment in a spoken sentence...|$|R

40|$|Freezing of gait (FOG) is a {{distressing}} {{symptom of}} Parkinson’s disease {{with a significant}} impact on fall risk and quality of life. Although medication improves some of the symptoms of slowness and rigidity, it is only minimally effective in treating FOG. Therefore, a better understanding of alternative treatment strategies is needed to manage this symptom. To investigate the effectiveness of <b>visual</b> <b>cueing</b> in the management of FOG, and to determine if <b>visual</b> <b>cueing</b> is dependent upon the spatial location of cue presentation. Six individuals with Parkinson’s disease who experience FOG were asked to complete the Timed Up and Go test three times in each of the following conditions: (i) no <b>visual</b> <b>cue,</b> (ii) cue presented at the users feet, (iii) cue presented at a distance equivalent to step length, and (iv) cue presented at a distance equivalent to stride length. Step length, velocity, and the elapsed time taken to complete a 180 degree turn was assessed using a 10 -ft Zeno electronic walkway. In addition, time taken to complete the Timed Up and Go test was recorded, and walker positioning assessed via Kinovea motion analysis software. The results of this study identified that irrespective of the spatial location of <b>cue</b> presentation, <b>visual</b> <b>cueing</b> led to an improvement in four out of the five outcome measures (timed up and go, turn time, walker positioning and step length).

5|$|When meeting {{another of}} the same species, P. fimbriata does not stalk but {{displays}} by moving quickly and smoothly, and displays at 4 to 27centimetres away.

5|$|Among {{the most}} {{satisfying}} moments in the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers appreciated the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player experimentation, such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile. Some of these <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> were lost amidst the game's visual presentation. TouchArcade wondered whether the simplified environment was an aesthetic choice or the result of efforts to save on development costs. The GameSpot reviewer was disappointed to see an option for paid puzzle solutions in an otherwise short game about discovering the secret to a puzzle on one's own. Compared to the main series, in which the player may stake out a building at a distance, the experimentation in Deus Ex Go is limited to finding the right answer rather than finding multiple routes to solve the same problem.|$|E
5|$|Other, {{more recent}} {{studies suggest that}} the idea of object {{permanence}} may not be an innate function of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that young children develop object permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these young children? Is object permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of object permanence rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and their perception of the object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other <b>visual</b> <b>cues,</b> such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E

40|$|Rationale: It {{is thought}} that alcohol {{addiction}} is influenced by environmental cues. One way this relationship is built is through Pavlovian learning, in which the alcohol is repeatedly paired with an environmental cue. Sign-tracking {{is a type of}} behavior that exhibits a Pavlovian learned association. Objectives: Our experiment studies induced sign-tracking using ethanol and a light <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> (conditioned stimulus or CS). Methods: In this study, one set of mice was given ethanol through intraperitoneal (IP) injections before being placed in an apparatus with a spatially isolated light <b>visual</b> <b>cue.</b> A control group was also placed in an apparatus with the light <b>visual</b> <b>cue,</b> but was not given ethanol IP injections until an hour after the trial (in the home cage). Following these conditioning trials, the mice were given a series of preference tests, where the <b>visual</b> <b>cue</b> was present (CS+) and both groups of mice received saline IP injections prior to the test. Results Throughout the conditioning trials, there was no distinction between groups for the time spent on the light side of the apparatus. However, when examining the nose poke counts per trial, the paired group poked more in the CS+ hole during preference test 2 compared to the CS- hole. Conclusions: The paired group of mice did learn the association, and {{it can be argued that}} sign-tracking was observed because the mice showed a preference for the CS+ in the nose poke count of preference test 1.

5|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurological condition in which dysarthria may develop later in the progression of the disease. Some individuals eventually lose all functional speech. AAC approaches are generally used to supplement and support natural speech. A portable amplifier, for example, {{may be used to}} increase the volume of speech and thus its intelligibility. The individual may be taught to point to the first letter of each word they say on an alphabet board, leading to a reduced speech rate and <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> for the listener to compensate for impaired articulation. Entire words can be spelled out if necessary. In users that have reduced range and speed of movement, a smaller than usual selection display may be preferred. High-tech AAC keyboard speech-generating devices are also used; keyguards may be required to prevent accidental keystrokes caused by the tremor typical of the disease. Factors affecting AAC use in Parkinson's disease include motor deficits and cognitive changes; the latter may result in unawareness of their problems with spoken communication.|$|E

5|$|While most ants have poor eyesight, Myrmecia ants have {{excellent}} vision. This trait {{is important to}} them, since Myrmecia primarily relies on <b>visual</b> <b>cues</b> for navigation. These ants are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a metre away. Winged alates are only active during the day, as they can see better. Members of a colony have different eye structures due to each individual fulfilling different tasks, and nocturnal species have larger ommatidia in comparison to those that are active during the day. Facet lenses also vary in size; for example, the diurnal species M. croslandi has a smaller lens in comparison to M. nigriceps and M. pyriformis which have larger lenses. Myrmecia ants have three photoreceptors that can see UV light, meaning {{they are capable of}} seeing colours that humans cannot. Their vision is said to be better than some mammals, such as cats, dogs or wallabies. Despite their excellent vision, worker ants of this genus find it difficult to find their nests at night, due to the difficulty of finding the landmarks they use to navigate. They are thus more likely to return to their nests the following morning, walking slowly with long pauses.|$|E
