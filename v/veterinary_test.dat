40|$|The Chemical and <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Test</b> Agency (CVUA) Stuttgart has {{detected}} glycidol {{fatty acid}} esters in refined vegetable fats on a palm oil base. The analytical methods currently available do not, however, permit the determination, merely {{the estimation of}} the exact levels. Fur-thermore, {{we do not know}} what levels of glycidol are released from the glycidol fatty acid esters during digestion in humans. Based on findings from animal experiments, glycidol is classified as probably carcinogenic to humans. Because of this major hazard potential and because refined edible fats are used in products like margarine and in infant formula, too, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) takes the findings of CVUA Stuttgart seriously and presents its initial evaluation of the as-sessment whether the detected ester-bound glycidol could constitute a threat to health. This evaluation is based on the worst case scenario that glycidol is released fully during digestion from the fatty acid esters and is then available in the organism. As the exact levels of glycidol fatty acid esters could not be reliably determined up to now in vegetable fats, BfR adopts the hypothetical assumption that one kilogram of edible fat contains one milligram glycidol. Based on this calculation, BfR comes to the conclusion that infants who are fed exclusively industrially prepared infant milk formula would take in harmful levels of glycidol...|$|E

40|$|The {{feeding of}} dairy cows and its {{influence}} upon their fertility is gaining increasing weight in the literature. Of particular importance is the energy supply during the early period of lactation. Due to the rapid increase of milk production and the relatively slower increase of food processing capacity, the degree and duration of this period of negative energy balance has particular consequences upon the fertility. For the {{period of one year}} the body condition of 284 cows was evaluated once a month, as well as during calving and service times. During this time, conventional <b>veterinary</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out. Particular breeding hygiene tests were carried out on a fortnightly basis. In addi-tion, the progesterone levels of the last milking were measured on a weekly basis during the first 42 days of lactation. At the observed cattle yard, three different feeding rations were fed, with energy levels of 6. 4, 6. 7 and 7. 1 MJ/kg dry matter, on the basis of maize and grass silage of very good quality. The body condition of most of the animals referred to the respective status of their state of lactation. The study focused on the influence of the cows&# 8217; body condition upon the herd&# 8217;s fertility, at the time of calving, on the consequence of differences in the body condition in the period 65 days before until 65 days after calving, and on the body condition at the time of service. Additional evaluations were carried out for the interval calving &# 8211; first service, interval between first service &# 8211; conception, days open, interval between calving, interval calving &# 8211; first observed heat, involuntary waiting periods, number of all services and number of successful services. The body condition at the time of calving has an influence upon the interval calving &# 8211; first observed heat. Cows with a better physical condition at the time of calving showed an earlier heat. Additional influences of the physical condition upon the fertility parameter could not be identified from the available data. During the first 42 days of lactation neither could a correlation between the body condition and progesterone levels be identified. On the basis of the evaluations carried out {{in the course of this}} study the following claim can be made: chances in the body condition during the reproductive cycle have, in the case of the here used TMR-feeding, an insignificant influence upon the herd&# 8217;s fertility parameter. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Surveillance for swine {{pathogens}} {{and health}} related biomarkers {{is of great}} importance to the financial success of the swine industry {{and the health of}} animal and human populations worldwide. Research has shown that the use of oral fluid specimens in diagnostics and surveillance provides many advantages over serum. To discover the full potential of this technology many aspects of its use must be evaluated e. g. sample collection and handling techniques, assay performance parameters and detection limits of pen-based samples. As reviewed in Chapter 1, the detection of many analytes in human and animal oral fluid samples has been reported. In the process of these discoveries, it was been identified that oral fluid sample collection material, post-collection processing and sample storage can affect testing results of human and animal oral fluid samples. Though little data was found in the literature regarding these effects on animal samples, limited reports suggest they may similarly affect <b>veterinary</b> <b>testing</b> of oral fluid specimens. As more diagnostic tests for human and animal oral fluid samples become available, it will be important to consider if and how these external factors affect testing results. Pursuant to the concerns identified in Chapter 1, the objective of the first research project (Chapter 2) was to evaluate the effect of oral fluid sampling material and post-collection processing on the results produced by antibody- and polymerase chain reaction-based assays. Oral fluid samples were collected from 104 pens of commercial wean-to-finish pigs using 3 types of rope. Processed (centrifuged and filtered) and unprocessed oral fluid samples were tested using commercial ELISAs for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) antibodies and total IgM, IgA, and IgG. Only unprocessed samples were tested for PRRSV nucleic acid and processed samples for PRRSV neutralizing antibodies. It was found that all three factors could affect results, but statistically significant effects were non-uniform and assay-dependent. The objective of the second study (Chapter 3) was to evaluate the detection limits of assays detecting PRRSV antibodies and PRRS virus in pen-based oral fluid samples from commercial swine. Five successive oral fluid samples were collected from 25 pens of commercial swine of known PRRSV prevalence (0 %, 4 %, 12 %, 20 % and 36 %) with five pens per prevalence level. PRRSV prevalence was established by vaccinating commercial swine with an intramuscular modified live PRRSV vaccine 14 days prior to the trial. The vaccinated pigs were then introduced at the designated prevalence levels into pens of otherwise PRRSV negative pigs one day prior to sample collection. Serum was collected from each pig in each pen to confirm expected PRRSV prevalence. Oral fluid and vaccinated pig serum was tested using RT-PCR and ELISA by six laboratories. Intra-laboratory agreement was measured and predicted probability of PRRSV detection in pen-based oral fluid samples was estimated for each assay...|$|R
