The {{specific}} details presented within that demonstration {{are not included in}} this report. Instead, we give an overview over the purpose and the procedure of conformance tests at the IITB. Conformance tests are used to check the conformance of a given communication-protocol-implementation against the protocol specification, which is usually an international standard. Conformance testing is done by communication of the testsystem, residing on a test center computer, with the implementation under test, residing on a <b>vendor</b> <b>computer,</b> using the underlying protocol layers.

5000|$|Minimizing latency is of {{interest}} in the capital markets, particularly where algorithmic trading is used to process market updates and turn around orders within milliseconds. Low latency trading refers to the network connections used by financial institutions to connect to stock exchanges and Electronic communication networks (ECNs) to execute financial transactions. [...] Joel Hasbrouck and Gideon Saar (2011) measure latency based on three components: the time it takes for 1)information to reach the trader, 2) the trader’s algorithms to analyze the information, and 3) the generated action to reach the exchange and get implemented. Hasbrouck and Saar contrast this with the way in which latencies are measured by many trading venues who use much more narrow definitions, such as, the processing delay measured from the entry of the order (at the <b>vendor’s</b> <b>computer)</b> to the transmission of an acknowledgement (from the <b>vendor’s</b> <b>computer).</b> [...] With the spread of computerized trading, electronic trading now makes up 60% to 70% of the daily volume on the NYSE and algorithmic trading close to 35%. Trading using computers has developed to the point where millisecond improvements in network speeds offer a competitive advantage for financial institutions.|$|R

The three sectors were distinct, because personal computers, corporate mainframes, and online computer networks operated in relative isolation. The arrival of the Internet effectively connected everything, facilitating the entry of mass-market vendors into enterprise software and of both mass-market and enterprise software <b>vendors</b> into <b>computer</b> services.

Part of {{the first phase of}} COLIS was the creation of a "Demonstrator " or "testbed " environment to investigate and demonstrate strategies for the incremental development of levels of technical interoperability in learning space application integration. Interoperability was based on adoption of IMS standards such as Content Packaging and Digital Repositories, the IEEE Learning Object Meta-data (LOM) standard, and the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) standard. This paper provides reflections on the evolution of the Demonstrator environment, and the implications of this experience for future developments in e-learning standards...|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 04 - 07, 1991 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaThere {{have been}} many recent {{technological}} advances in small computers, graphics stations, and system networks. This {{has made it possible}} to build highly advanced distributed processing systems for telemetry data acquisition and processing. Presently there is a plethora of vendors marketing powerful new network workstation hardware and software products. <b>Computer</b> <b>vendors</b> are rapidly developing new products as new technology continues to emerge. It is becoming difficult to procure and install a new computer system before it has been made obsolete by a competitor or even the same vendor. If one purchases the best hardware and software products individually, the system can end up being composed of incompatible components from different vendors that do not operate as one integrated homogeneous system. If one uses only hardware and software from one vendor in order to simplify system integration, the system will be limited to only those products that the vendor chooses to develop. To truly take advantage of the rapidly advancing computer technology, today’s telemetry systems should be designed for an open systems environment. This paper defines an optimum open architecture system designed around industry wide standards for both hardware and software. This will allow for different <b>vendor’s</b> <b>computers</b> to operate in the same distributed networked system, and will allow software to be portable to the various computers and workstations in the system while maintaining the same user interface. The open architecture system allows for new products to be added as they become available to increase system performance and capability in a truly heterogeneous system environment...|$|R

40|$|This {{draft report}} was {{prepared}} by NIST {{staff at the}} request of the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC) to serve as a point of discussion at the Dec. 4 - 5 meeting of the TGDC. Prepared in conjunction with members of a TGDC subcommittee, the report is a discussion draft and does not represent a consensus view or recommendation from either NIST or the TGDC. It reflects the conclusions of NIST research staff for purposes of discussion. The TGDC is an advisory group to the Election Assistance Commission, which produces voluntary voting system guidelines and was established by the Help America Vote Act. NIST serves as a technical advisor to the TGDC. The NIST research and the draft report's conclusions are based on interviews and discussions with election officials, voting system <b>vendors,</b> <b>computer</b> scientists, and other experts in the field, as well as a literature search and the technical expertise of its authors. It is intended to help in developing guidelines for the next generation of electronic voting machine to ensure that these systems are as reliable, accurate, and secure as possible. Issues of certification or decertification of voting systems currently in place are outside the scope of this document and of the TGDC's deliberations. VOTING MACHINES...|$|R
