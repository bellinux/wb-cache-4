40|$|Working age {{adults with}} <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in BC are not {{achieving}} {{the same level}} of employment as people with disabilities in general.

This study investigates the barriers employers face in hiring people with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> through two methodologies; semi-structured interviews and case studies. My analysis finds that the most effective mechanism for helping employers understand the workplace capabilities of people with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> is to expose employers to working with people with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments.</b> Recommendations include implementing a BC Public Service Agency initiative to encourage public sector leadership in employing people with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments...</b>|$|R
40|$|Visual {{perception}} {{is an important}} source of information when driving a car. <b>Visual</b> <b>impairments</b> of drivers will therefore have an effect on performing the driving task. However, the effects on the crash rate are limited. The reason is, among other things, that people with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> often compensate for this disability, for example by avoiding crowded rush hours and driving in the dark, by adjusting their driving speed and by applying other visual strategies. Many <b>visual</b> <b>impairments,</b> like cataract and reduced acuity of vision, are more frequent among the elderly. However, other <b>visual</b> <b>impairments,</b> e. g. colour-blindness, are not age-related. Most of the negative results of <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> can be remedied by devices or treatments; this cannot be done for all impairments, for example colour-blindness.

40|$|At colleges or {{universities}} {{students with}} <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> {{have to be}} mainstreamed. Therefore, each year {{quite a lot of}} students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> can be found in classes scattered over the different colleges and universities in every country. However, most teachers have not been instructed how to teach students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in a mainstream classroom. Thus, they worry about changes in the syllabus, availability of suitable textbooks, and how to teach all students together in an effective way. Obtaining necessary information about the students’ problems and sources for help are paramount for the successful integration of students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> into the mainstream classroom. This paper, therefore, aims to provide information for teachers with little or no background knowledge in special education.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Charles Bonnet {{syndrome}} (CBS) is by complex {{visual hallucinations}} and ocular pathology causing vision loss. It {{has been considered}} that CBS occurs frequently in elderly visually handicapped patients and the hallucinations are limited to the visual modality. Three hypotheses we examined were: (1) whether <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> are associated with visual hallucinations (2) whether <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> are associated with auditory hallucinations (3) whether the development of visual and auditory hallucinations in patients with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> is associated with age. METHOD: Data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) in the United States were used to examine whether associations between <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> and <b>visual</b> hallucinations {{can be found in}} the general population, and whether such influences of <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> are limited to the visual modality and to specific age groups. RESULTS: Prevalence of visual and auditory hallucinations in respondents with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> were 12. 8 % (95 % Confidence Interval (CI) = 3. 4 - 22. 2 %) and 7. 1 % (95 %CI = 2. 6 - 11. 6 %) respectively. Although the point estimates were substantive, the odds ratios between <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> and existence of visual hallucinations or auditory hallucinations were not statistically significant (odds ratio (OR) = 2. 43, 95 %CI = 0. 92 - 6. 44, P = 0. 07 and OR = 2. 16, 95 %CI = 0. 87 - 5. 33, P = 0. 10, respectively) in the whole sample. Association between <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> and <b>visual</b> hallucination was significant (OR = 3. 09, 95 %CI = 1. 06 - 8. 99, P < 0. 05) only in the elderly (age group 60 -), while significant association was found between <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> and auditory hallucinations in a younger age group (age group 18 - 39, OR = 13. 25, 95 %CI = 2. 99 - 58. 75, P < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: <b>Visual</b> <b>impairments</b> act as a trigger for both visual and auditory hallucinations.

40|$|The {{itinerant}} {{service for}} students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> provides additional professional instructions and teaches special educational knowledge and skills. At {{the same time it}} provides consulting and support for parents, teachers, peers and other colleagues to ensure inclusion of students into regular forms of education in the entire vertical of the school system as well as at their home. The itinerant service {{for students with}} <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> was created as a result of paradigmatic, legislative and social changes, as well {{as a result of the}} needs of practice, as the students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> have been educated in regular educational programs for more than 40 years before the adoption of the law. Despite the fact, that inclusion of students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in various educational programs became both an objective and demand, Slovenia is currently still struggling with ensuring the personnel, material, legislative and organizational conditions for the implementation of itinerant service for students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments.</b> Every itinerant teacher of students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> has to possess extensive body of knowledge, competencies, skills and also beliefs and attitudes from the field of <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> and education that enables efficient and high quality work in order to create positive relationships that are the foundation of cooperative work between all people involved.

The condition can be inherited (Primary glaucoma) or a secondary condition to a variety of other eye issues including tumors or lens luxation. Both breeds are affected by juvenile cataracts which can occur at up to four years of age. Symptoms can include discoloring of the pupil, and treatment may include surgery to remove the cataract.|$|E
5|$|Every {{participant}} at the Paralympics {{has their}} disability grouped {{into one of}} five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; <b>visual</b> <b>impairment,</b> including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly {{under one of the}} other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to assess {{self-regulation}} of students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> across two academic subjects, language and math. The participants were 46 Greek students with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> who completed self-regulation measures across the subject matters of language and math. Initially, the factorial validity of the scale was established. In turn, results pointed to the existence of a single universal self-regulation functioning pattern in individuals with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> across subject matters (at the mean level). Measurement invariance was also observed at the item level through imposing equality constraints between items from different subjects.

5|$|Johnson {{allegedly}} remarried, {{this time}} to Angeline Johnson, in the early 1930s, but, as with Harris, {{it is unlikely that}} the union was officially registered. Throughout the Great Depression and the 1940s, he performed in several cities and towns in Texas, including Beaumont. A city directory shows that in 1945, a Reverend W. J. Johnson—undoubtedly Blind Willie—operated the House of Prayer at 1440 Forrest Street, in Beaumont. In 1945, his home was destroyed by a fire, but, with nowhere else to go, Johnson continued to live in the ruins of his house, where he was exposed to the humidity. He contracted malarial fever, and no hospital would admit him, either because of his <b>visual</b> <b>impairment,</b> as Angeline Johnson stated in an interview with Charters, or because he was black. Over the course of the year, his condition steadily worsened until he died, on September 18, 1945. His death certificate reported syphilis and blindness as contributing factors.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{was born}} in 1846 near Franklin in Pendleton County, Virginia (now West Virginia) to the {{affluent}} and prominent Johnson family. His father, Colonel Jacob F.

Like his elder brother James, Johnson was born with severe <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> which became total blindness {{a few years after}} his birth. He and his brother received their early education at home from a governess. Johnson furthered his education at the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind, a common school in Franklin during the American Civil War, and at a classical school in New Market. During his studies at New Market, Johnson made considerable progress in mathematics, literature, science and foreign languages.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{not born}} blind, though he was {{impaired}} with the disability at an early age. It is uncertain how he lost his sight, but it is generally agreed by most biographers of Johnson that he was blinded by his stepmother when he was seven years old, a claim that was first made by Johnson's purported widow Angeline Johnson. In her recollection, Willie's father had violently confronted his stepmother about her infidelity, and during the argument she splashed Willie with a caustic solution of lye water, permanently blinding him. Other theories have also been developed to explain Johnson's <b>visual</b> <b>impairment,</b> including that he wore the wrong spectacles, that he viewed a partial solar eclipse that was observable over Texas in 1905, {{or a combination of}} the two conjectures.|$|E

5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} H.nidulans are {{neurotoxic}} if ingested. The toxin {{was identified as}} polyporic acid, a terphenyl compound first identified from a mycelial culture of the fungus in 1877. This chemical, present at 20–40% of the dry weight of the fruit bodies, inhibits the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. It is found in other mushrooms, but in much lower amounts. In a poisoning case reported in 1992, one German family who consumed H.nidulans experienced nausea, impaired movement, <b>visual</b> <b>impairment,</b> liver and kidney failure; symptoms began about 12 hours after consuming the mushroom. Additionally, the urine of all three poisoning victims temporarily turned violet. They recovered fully a week later. Similar symptoms and recovery were reported in a 2013 poisoning case, in which the fungus was confused with the edible Fistulina hepatica.

For people with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments,</b> who do not always need the visual display of a mobile phone, alternative means of eyes-free wearable interaction are particularly appealing. To explore the potential impacts of such technology, we conducted two studies.

The second was an interview and design probe study with 10 participants with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments.</b> Our findings expand on past work to characterize a range of trends in smartphone use and accessibility issues therein. Participants with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> also responded positively to two eyes-free wearable device scenarios: a wristband or ring and a glasses-based device. Discussions on projected use of these devices suggest that small, easily accessible, and discreet wearable input could positively impact the ability of people with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> to access information on the go and to participate in certain social interactions.

40|$|Introduction: Anxiety is {{the most}} common {{psychological}} problem reported among children with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments.</b> Although cognitive behavior therapy interventions have proven successful in treating childhood anxiety, it is unclear whether they are suitable and accessible for children who have <b>visual</b> <b>impairments.</b> This study aimed to determine if and how traditional cognitive behavior therapy–based interventions could be adapted for use with this specific population by interviewing children with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> themselves. Methods: A qualitative research design was used. Sixteen children with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> (aged 9 to 13 years) participated in two focus group interviews. Participants attended two special schools in the Western Cape, South Africa. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim, and content analysis was undertaken. Results: Three primary themes emerged from the focus group data: (1) difficulties encountered by children with visual impairments; (2) existing coping strategies; and (3) insight into the concepts of feelings, thoughts and behaviors (central to cognitive behavior therapy). Discussion: The emergent themes and their implications for the adaptation of a cognitive behavior therapy–based anxiety intervention are discussed.

40|$|INTRODUCTION A {{growing number}} of people suffer from <b>visual</b> <b>{{impairments}}.</b> These impairments and the resulting disabilities greatly affect {{the quality of life of}} many older, otherwise healthy people. The rehabilitation needs of people with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> cover a wide scope of activities including reading, face recognition, independent mobility, attending to daily activities, and watching television (TV). Traditionally, vision rehabilitation has been aimed at improving mobility and reading skills. The incorporation of computerized image enhancement to improve video images for people with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> was first proposed by Peli and Peli. Although image enhancement may be used in portable mobility devices, 2, 3 in the near future we see the main value of image enhancement in providing people with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> with access to the growing volume of video images presented on stationary monitors. TV is an important means of obtaining information and sharing in our culture. ...|$|R
