5000|$|Diospyros blancoi (commonly {{known as}} <b>velvet</b> <b>apple,</b> velvet {{persimmon}} or mabola tree) is a tree {{of the genus}} Diospyros of ebony trees and persimmons. Its edible fruit has a skin covered in a fine, velvety fur which is usually reddish-brown, and soft, creamy, pink flesh, with a taste and aroma comparable to fruit cream cheese. It is native to the Philippines, [...] where kamagong usually refers to the entire tree, and mabolo or tálang {{is applied to the}} fruit. <b>Velvet</b> <b>apple</b> trees are found, but rare, in Sri Lanka too.|$|E
50|$|Another woman {{painter who}} excelled {{in the field}} of art in the Philippines was Paz Paterno. Her {{important}} painting known as Still Life was decorated with native fruits such as lanzones (Lansium domesticum), bananas, mabolos (<b>velvet</b> <b>apple,</b> Diospyros blancoi), atis (sugar-apple, the fruit of Annona squamosa), balimbings (carambola or starfruit, fruit of Averrhoa carambola), pili nuts, and coconuts.|$|E
50|$|The {{leaves of}} <b>velvet</b> <b>apple</b> trees {{have been shown}} to contain isoarborinol methyl ether (also called cylindrin) and fatty esters of α- and β-amyrin. Both isoarborinol methyl ether and the amyrin mixture {{demonstrated}} antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties have also been shown for the isolated amyrin mixture.|$|E
40|$|Cover Crop: Sorghum {{is used as}} {{a drought}} tolerant, summer annual {{rotational}} cover crop either alone or seeded in a warm season cover crop mixture. There are multiple cultivars of sorghum available for use as a cover crop including sorghum-Sudangrass hybrids (Sorghum bicolor x Sorghum bicolor var. sudanense). However, all sorghum and Sudangrass-related species have the potential to smother weeds, suppress nematode species, and penetrate compacted subsoil (Clark, 2007). Sorghum cover crops can also be used as livestock forage in a cropping system (Magdoff and Van Es, 2009). Sorghum-Sudangrass hybrids can produce up to 4, 000 - 5, 000 pounds of dry matter per acre (Clark, 2007). Soil Compaction: Sorghums and sorghum-Sudangrass hybrids have extensive root systems that can penetrate up to 8 feet into the soil and extend more than 3 feet away from the stem (Shoemaker and Bransby, 2010). These aggressive root systems alleviate subsoil compaction. To encourage more significant root growth, sorghum stalks should be cut at least once during the growing season when they reach 3 – 4 feet tall (Clark, 2007). Weed Management: Sorghums are quick growing grasses that have the potential to shade out and/or smother weed populations when planted at a high density. In addition, root exudates of sorghum have been shown to reduce the growth of weeds such as <b>velvet</b> leaf, thorn <b>apple,</b> redroot pigweed, crabgrass, yellow foxtail and barnyardgrass (Stapleton et al., 2010). Sorghum is also recommended for control of nutsedge infestations (Clark, 2007). Flowering sorghum seed head and vegetation in Tucson, Arizona...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Antioxidant {{plays a role}} in {{inhibiting}} oxidation by binding to free radicals. As a result, the cell {{damage that}} leads to degenerative diseases can be inhibited. This research was conducted to determine the antioxidant activity and total phenolic content of ethyl acetate fraction of velvet aple (Diospyros blancoi A. DC.) juice. Previously known that other plants from genus Diospyros contain phenolic compounds such as quercetin. Antioxidant activity test performed qualitatively and quantitatively using radical of 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 pikrilhidrazil (DPPH) and expressed as the value Inhibition Concentration 50 (IC 50). Determination of total phenolic using Folin-Ciocalteu method expressed as equivalent mass of gallic acid. Phenolic compounds will be oxidized by the Folin-Ciocalteu under alkaline conditions, forming a blue solution. The results showed that the ethyl acetate fraction of <b>velvet</b> <b>apple</b> juice has very strong antioxidant activity with IC 50 of (30. 0 ± 0. 09) mg / mL. Total phenolic content of (393. 5 ± 0. 35) mg gallic acid equivalents per gram of ethyl acetate fraction. Keywords: antioxidant, <b>velvet</b> <b>apple</b> (Diospyros blancoi A. DC), ethyl acetate fraction, DPPH, total phenolic content...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} at the Hill Tracts Agricultural Research Station, Ramgarh during two years in 2007 and 2008 to evaluate the variability and performance of selected 11 <b>velvet</b> <b>apple</b> germplasm. A lot of variations in different parameters were observed among the trees. The age of plant varied from 7 to 25 years having tree volume 58 m 3 to 428 m 3. The number of fruits ranged from 42 to 674 per plant with single fruit weight 118 to 283 g. The length and diameter ranged from 6. 63 cm to 7. 7 cm and 5. 73 cm to 8. 3 cm, respectively. The maximum edible portion (68. 3 %) was recorded in DD RAM 011, while it was the lowest (47. 6 %) in DD RAM 001. The highest TSS% ranged from 7. 28 % to 14. 9 %. Highest yield per plant (103. 67 kg) was observed in DD RAM 001 and it was lowest in DD RAM 008 (5. 99 kg). All the parameters showed poor correlation among them. Considering the factors of weight and size, edible portion %, TSS %, taste, sweetness, and yield per plant, the line DD RAM 011 was found better than others...|$|E
