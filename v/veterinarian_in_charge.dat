40|$|Six {{hundred and}} thirty {{individual}} serum samples from dairy sheep were tested {{for the presence of}} antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii using an indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT). The sampled animals came from 33 dairy herds representative of the southern area of the Tuscany region. Questionnaires exploring the management system were filled in by the <b>veterinarian</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the herds. Using a cut-off of 1 : 64, 214 animals (33. 97 %) were positive with a herd prevalence of 96. 97 %. Using a sensitivity and specificity of 80 % and 95 % respectively, the true prevalence was calculated as 38. 62 % (CI, 34. 82 %, 42. 43 %). In the multivariate statistical analysis, T. gondi i seropositivity in sheep was significantly associated with herd size < 300 (OR= 2. 046, CI= 1. 284 - 3. 261), still water source (OR= 1. 514, CI= 1. 050 - 2. 182), and access of cats to water given to animals (OR= 1. 585, CI= 1. 057 - 2. 379) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Serum {{samples from}} 630 milk sheep, in 33 dairy flocks {{representative}} of the southern area of the Tuscany region, were tested {{for the presence of}} antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii using an indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT). Questionnaires exploring the management system were completed by the <b>veterinarian</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the flocks. Results At least one seropositive animal was found in 32 of the 33 flocks tested (97. 0 %; 95 % CI: 84. 2 %, 99. 9 %). In the positive flocks, median seroprevalence was 29. 4 % (interquartile range: 15. 9 %- 46. 1 %). Overall animal-level seroprevalence, adjusted for sampling weights and test sensitivity and specificity, was 33. 3 % (95 % CI: 24. 8 %, 42. 7 %). In a multivariable negative binomial regression model the number of seropositive animals in a flock decreased with increasing flock size (for > 400 vs. CR) [*]=[*] 0. 62; 95 % CI: 0. 41, 0. 95; P [*]=[*] 0. 028) and was greater on farms where stray cats had access to animals’ water (CR [*]=[*] 1. 54; 95 % CI: 1. 05, 2. 26; P [*]=[*] 0. 027). Conclusions Small flock size and access of cats to water are potential risk factors for Toxoplasma infection in sheep in the Grosseto district in Tuscany, Italy. Sheep could be an important source of T. gondii infection in humans, since we estimate that between 25 % and 43 % of sheep in the district were seropositive. Toxoplasmosis is also likely to be an important cause of abortion in sheep in the district. Control and prophylactic measures must be adopted to improve the rearing system and the implementation of health promoting programmes in a joint effort between sheep farmers, farmers’ associations and veterinarians to inform about the means of transmission of the infection and for {{a better understanding of the}} disease. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{controversial}} discussions arose during major animal disease outbreaks in the EU about the ethical soundness of mass culling. In contrast to numerous publications about ethical issues and laboratory animals/animal experiments, literature concerning ethical deliberations {{in the case}} of mass culling as a means of outbreak control remain scarce. <b>Veterinarians</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of decision about and implementation of mass culling actions find themselves in an area of conflict in between the officially required animal disease control policy and a public that is increasingly critical. Those veterinarians are faced with the challenge to defend the relevant decisions against all stakeholders and also themselves. In this context an interdisciplinary workshop was initiated in Switzerland in October 2007 with ethicians and (official) veterinarians from Germany, Switzerland and Austria. With the aim to identify ethical components of animal disease control for official veterinarians, talks and moderated group discussions took place. This article summarizes selected discussion points and conclusions...|$|R

40|$|Quarantine, as a {{means of}} {{preventing}} disease importation, has been used for people and animals since the mid- 19 th century in Canada. The first animal quarantine facility in North America was established at Lévis, Québec in 1876. This quarantine station existed at Lévis until 1982 when it was closed and the function moved to Mirabel, Québec, near the International Airport. <b>Veterinarians</b> were <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> during the life of the Lévis Quarantine Station and some were also <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the Port of Quebec or a nearby District Office prior to the 1950 's. In 1884 and 1886 the value of such a facility was illustrated in preventing the entry into Canada of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia and a vesicular disease. It was described in 1933 as “undoubtedly our most important quarantine station” and a year's operating costs as “trifling in comparison to losses which could occur if a foreign plague invaded this country”. This facility's history also illustrated the close veterinary and human medical cooperation during the early days of organized veterinary medicine in Canada. The station was an example for the establishment of other such facilities in North America...|$|R
