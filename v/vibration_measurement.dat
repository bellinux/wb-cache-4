A glass fiber reinforced composite material sample is fabricated with two different polarimetric sensor types embedded in it. The two types of polarimetric sensors embedded are based on polarization maintaining photonic crystal fiber (PM-PCF) and Panda fiber. The vibration frequencies and amplitudes are measured using the embedded polarimetric sensors and the results from both sensor types are compared. Analysis {{of the limitations of}} Panda fiber based <b>vibration</b> <b>measurements</b> over PM-PCF is carried out and the results are presented. It is found that for high amplitude <b>vibration</b> <b>measurements,</b> PMPCF based sensors offer a wider linear range and are more suitable than Panda fiber based polarimetric fiber sensors.
