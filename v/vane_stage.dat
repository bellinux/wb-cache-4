40|$|Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant {{produces}} low-BTU syngas which imposes design {{constraints on}} the gas turbine (compressor, combustor and turbine itself). Consequently, the gas turbine axial flow compressor in an IGCC plant can operate at a higher pressure ratio as compared with its natural gas service, pushing the compressor towards its surge limit. Therefore, increasing the air flow through the axial compressor, while bleeding it for other uses after compression, alleviates this problem. Through the use of steady state and dynamic models this research work, firstly analysed the influence of syngas firing {{on the performance of}} the gas turbine designed for natural gas service. Secondly, this study also assessed the influence of bleeding air from the gas turbine axial flow compressor on the overall performance of the gas turbine. The steady state model was developed in MATLAB® and the dynamic model was developed using Simulink®. The dynamic model simulated the inlet air flow control using inlet guide <b>vanes,</b> <b>stage</b> by stage model of a 17 -stage axial compressor, a thermodynamic model of the combustors, a lumped turbine blade cooling model, a 4 -stage turbine model and a torsional shaft model. This open loop dynamic model was then controlled using control blocks that modulated the inlet guide vanes and fuel supply to facilitate stable operation using natural gas and syngas. The model investigated the impact of switching from natural gas firing to syngas firing. The model also demonstrated the influence of air extraction on the ability to maintain the compressor pressure ratio and the gas turbine output. Influence of variation in the diluent nitrogen quantity supplied to the combustor was also analysed. In summary, the main objective of this research is to provide a generic method for performing dynamic modelling of the gas turbine in an IGCC plant, operating with air-side integration.

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} demands for energy world-wide has prompted research into {{and implementation of}} devices to harvest power from renewable sources of energy, such as hydroelectricity. Large-scale hydroelectric plants have existed for over a century, and are capable of producing over 10000 MW of power. However, such facilities are expensive and generally {{have a significant impact}} on the local ecosystem; as such, there are relatively few locations and communities that can support their construction. Small-scale hydroelectric facilities, which produce power up to 30 MW, are increasing in popularity since they do not divert the natural flow of the river and are capable of harnessing energy from smaller sources than their large-scale cousins one of the main concerns being the negative effects they can have on the local fauna. Specifically, fish inadvertently passing through the facility can be hurt or killed by the inlet guide vanes or rotor assembly through a variety of mechanisms, including striking the structure, being caught between rotating and stationary parts, or through dramatic changes in fluid pressure. In order to mitigate injury to fish passing through small-scale hydroelectric facilities, AlphaStar Hydro has developed a novel vaneless swirl injector to replace current inlet guide <b>vane</b> <b>stages,</b> which allows the fish to travel through with minimal damage, while still imparting the necessary swirl component onto the flow for proper turbine operation. This swirl injector is made up of a single spiral flighting wrapped around a central shaft. The main focus of this work is on quantifying and optimizing the flow through the vaneless swirl injector. Of primary concern is the axisymmetry of the flow exiting the injector, the pressure drop across it, and the swirl that it provides, all of which directly impact rotor performance. Based upon a preliminary patented design provided by AlphaStar Hydro, the flow field generated by the injector was determined through a computational fluid dynamics study. This provided the foundation for a geometric optimization study to maximize flow axisymmetry and swirl, while minimizing pressure loss. A 5 by 4 grid was setup using number of revolutions and pitch angle as variables. Four metrics were measured: axial axisymmetry, tangential axisymmetry, swirl number and pressure loss. Using the four metrics, an objective function was created and was subsequently optimized using a line search algorithm. The study concluded that the number of revolutions is not as important as the pitch angle and that the optimal geometry is 4 revolutions at a pitch angle of 25 degrees. A test rig was designed and constructed in order to test the newly optimized design with the addition of the nose cone. The setup is composed of a reservoir, a pump, a gate valve, a circle-to-rectangle transition, flow conditioning elements, the swirl injector, a test section and return plumbing. The rig was commissioned and initially characterized by measuring the velocity drift with time, the change in temperature with time, and the inlet velocity profile upstream of the injector. The experimental facility was coupled with numerical simulations to explore the flow field downstream of the optimized swirl injector with an attached nose cone, as would be the case upon rotor installation. The pressure, axial velocity and tangential velocity contours were analyzed to assess the performance of the swirl injector in its operational configuration, in preparation for rotor installation. A recirculation zone on the nose cone was observed, which was due to the flow separation on the nose cone. The swirl numbers and the axisymmetry metrics were compared between the optimization model and the nose cone model, revealing that there were no significant differences between the two. The experimentally measured velocity profiles were found to match well with the numerical profiles, as did the pressure distributions within the test section. This provided cross-validation of the experimental and numerical studies. The experimental data exhibited relatively high fluctuations in the velocity signals, however...|$|R

This compressor was designed to produce a 14 : 1 pressure ratio in ten stages with an adiabatic efficiency of 88. 2 percent in the flight propulsion system.

The proposed duty cycle of ATS turbines will require the use of different criteria in the design of the materials for the critical hot gas path components. In particular, thermal barrier coatings will be an essential feature of the hot gas path components in these machines. While such coatings are routinely used in high-performance aircraft engines and are becoming established in land-based turbines, the requirements of the ATS turbine application are sufficiently different that significant improvements in thermal barrier coating technology will be necessary. In particular, it appears that thermal barrier coatings will have to function on all airfoil sections of the first <b>stage</b> <b>vanes</b> and blades to provide the significant temperature reduction required. In contrast, such coatings applied to the blades and vances of advanced aircraft engines are intended primarily to reduce air cooling requirements and extend component lifetime; failure of those coatings can be tolerated without jeopardizing mechanical or corrosion performance.

Both airline and maintenance companies need the best possible accu-racy regarding the prediction of emerging costs and time of en-gine maintenance process to secure their operation.

In a pilot project a Bayesian belief network (BBN) has been de-veloped to determine the deterioration condition of the General Electric CF 6 - 80 C 2 first stage high pressure turbine (HPT) noz-zle guide vane (NGV). The aim of this paper is to extend the used BBN techniques to the HPT first and second stage rotor blades and the second <b>stage</b> <b>vanes.</b> Thereby, its objective is to prove the successful application of the developed method for constructing a BBN for component hardware forecast.

Performing statistical data analysis and combining these parameters with expert knowledge result in component specific BBNs.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain better performance, gas {{turbines}} always operate with high inlet temperature. This contributes to {{a high level of}} thermal load on the first <b>stage</b> <b>vane</b> endwall. To ensure safe operation of a gas turbine within a proper temperature range, the cooling performance of the vane endwall must be further investigated. In the present study, effects of the mainstream turbulence and upstream coolant flow direction on the endwall cooling and vane suction side surface phantom cooling were numerically investigated. Three-dimensional (3 D) Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations combined with shear stress transport (SST) k-ω turbulence model were solved to conduct the numerical simulations on basis of the validated turbulence model. The calculated results indicate that both the adiabatic cooling effectiveness on the endwall and the phantom cooling effectiveness on the vane suction side surface are significantly influenced by slot injection angle. For α=- 30 °, the coolant injection is driven towards the vane suction side, which contributes to the lowest adiabatic cooling effectiveness level on the pressure side endwall and the highest phantom cooling effectiveness level on the vane suction side surface. With the increase of the slot injection angle, the adiabatic cooling effectiveness level on the pressure side endwall is enhanced significantly. In contrast, the phantom cooling (when the vane suction side is cooled by coolant originating from the endwall) of the vane suction side surface is reduced significantly. This is because a large slot injection angle leads to a large coolant momentum towards the pressure side. Moreover, the case with a smaller slot injection angle obtains a slightly higher area-averaged adiabatic cooling effectiveness level around the leading edge due to a relatively larger portion of coolant being confined near the leading edge. In addition, the inlet turbulence intensity has a small impact on the overall endwall cooling and the phantom cooling of the vane suction side surface compared to the slot injection angle...|$|R
40|$|A few {{components}} {{belonging to}} an engine retrieved {{from the wreckage}} of crashed aircraft were sent to this laboratory for investigation. The components that were sent for laboratory analysis are (i) fractured rim and diaphragm of stage IV compressor disc, (ii) spline bolt, (iii) HPTR blade, (iv) LPTR blade, (v) HP nozzle guide <b>vane,</b> (vi) <b>stage</b> I compressor rotor blades, and (vii) a metallic piece recovered from fuel oil unit. Examination revealed that the diaphragm of stage IV compressor disc had sheared off circumferentially and along the fillet of the rim. While majority of the fracture surface showed reverse slant fracture features, a region spanning about 50 - 60 mm on the fracture surface had smooth and flat appearance. Fractographic study conducted on this region showed presence of a half-moon shape region, indicative of progressive mode of crack propagation. Further examination of this region under a scanning electron microscope confirmed that the crack propagation was by fatigue. The fatigue crack {{was found to have}} initiated at the fillet of the rim of the disc on the side facing stage V compressor. Detailed examination revealed that after initiation, the crack had propagated progressively over about 18 mm in length and 2. 5 mm in depth. Followed by this, the fatigue crack propagation was relatively fast through the remaining thickness of the diaphragm and over a length of 50 - 60 mm on the diaphragm surface. Once the fatigue crack attained this length, the diaphragm sheared off circumferentially and along the fillet of the rim instantaneously by overload. The fatigue crack origin region was severely damaged due to post fracture rubbing and hence, no further study was possible to examine {{whether or not there was}} any localized stress concentrator either mechanical or metallurgical, which could be responsible for the fatigue crack initiation. It may, however, be noted that there were no metallurgical abnormalities in the material of construction of the compressor disc and it was found to conform to specification of BT 3 - 1 Ti-alloy. Study of the surfaces and the metallurgical examination did not reveal any evidences of overheating in the components such as HPTR blade, LPTR blade and HP nozzle guide vane. Although certain microstructural changes were observed in the material of HPTR blade, these changes were found to be within the acceptable range, and they are expected to occur in the material over prolonged use at elevated temperatures. Although the features on the fracture surfaces of the spline bolts were completely obliterated due to oxidation/exposure to fire, gross fractographic features and deformation preceding fracture indicated that the failure was by overload. Compositional analysis confirmed that the metallic piece recovered from the fuel oil unit is a fractured segment of the nose-fairing. Analysis also showed presence of traces of nose-fairing on the damaged regions of stage I compressor rotor blades. Analysis suggests that the compressor disc with a fatigue crack of length 50 - 60 mm at the rim fillet region would not survive, and it is likely to fracture during engine run. It is, therefore, stated that the fatigue fracture of stage IV compressor disc was the first in the chain of events that led to engine failure...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{represents}} an experimental {{investigation of a}} compact aero engine centrifugal compressor stage with pipe-diffuser and tandem deswirler in which the vanes of the first deswirl row are immerged into the diffuser channel. This geometrical arrangement eliminates a vaneless space between diffuser and deswirler, which is present in current conventional centrifugal compressor stages and can result into much lower outer stage diameters. In addition to the nominal centered alignment of the first deswirl row vanes within the diffuser channel, {{a variation of the}} circumferential positioning of the deswirler towards diffuser suction and pressure side was conducted. Furthermore, a bleed extraction between impeller and diffuser was varied. For a comparison of the compact compressor stage to conventional stage designs, additionally three compressor stages with vaneless space between diffuser and deswirler were experimentally investigated, whereas each stage contained a different deswirl system. Impeller and diffuser inlet geometry of all four stages were the same. The study demonstrates that the compact centrifugal compressor stage reaches similar performance values in terms of pressure build-up and efficiency as the stages with decoupled deswirlers. In comparison to a conventional stage with simple one row prismatic deswirl <b>vanes,</b> the compact <b>stage</b> even shows a significant increase in performance. However, the compact stage looses surge margin compared to all three reference stages. Also, a shift of the characteristics of the different stage components was detected. The impeller of the compact stage shows a slightly higher pressure build-up and slightly lower work input. Furthermore, the diffuser inlet shows a significant increase in pressure build-up which is linked to the loss in surge margin. Within the diffuser channel the pressure build-up is lower due to the lower dynamic head at the channel inlet. This results from the increased diffusion at the diffuser inlet. The three-dimensionally designed deswirlers of the compact stage and of two reference stages are showing equal characteristics, whereas the pressure build-up of the deswirler of the last reference <b>stage</b> with prismatic <b>vanes</b> is significantly decreased and the total pressure loss increased. With a total-to-static stage balancing, a variation of the circumferential positioning of the deswirler to the diffuser of the compact compressor stage shows very small changes in pressure build-up and efficiency. However, the surge margin increases from suction to pressure sided positioning of the deswirler relative to the diffuser. With a total-to-total balancing of the stage, the pressure sided positioning of the deswirler relative to the diffuser shows the smallest losses but also the highest Mach-numbers at the stage exit...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} a shroud bleed slot system of a compressor stage from a turbocharger unit used in heavy duty diesel engines of approximately 300 kW. The {{first part of the}} work presented in this thesis deals with a detailed analysis of a compressor stage with and without a shroud bleed slot, and various slot geometries which include three different widths and three different positions of the slot. The second stage of this study is an investigation of an addition of a set of vanes in the annular cavity of the shroud bleed slot system. This investigation was performed using both CFD modelling and experimental measurements. The CFD model used a full stage steady state approach. Very good agreement was achieved between the experimental measurements of efficiency, pressure ratio and mass flow rate and those values predicted by the CFD model over the entire performance map, providing confidence in the CFD model as a tool to help understand the flow features of the bleed slot, its various geometries and an addition of annular cavity <b>vanes.</b> The first <b>stage</b> of the study emphasises the significance of the inclusion of a shroud bleed slot into the conventional turbocharger compressor stage and the appropriate choice of the slot geometry in order to achieve as the widest map possible. In comparison with the non-bleed slot compressor stage, the bleed slot significantly extended the map width at the higher speeds, by reducing the surge mass flow rate. However, no or very little improvement was found at lower speeds. The analysis of changes to design parameters revealed that it is vital to obtain an optimised geometry of the bleed slot system for a compressor stage to achieve a wider map without compromising other performance characteristics of the compressor. This study also discloses the importance of an optimised shape of the shroud bleed slot system to increase the compressor performance by avoiding the recirculation losses within the slot and cavity passages at both choke and surge flow conditions. In the second stage of the work presented in this thesis, three different types of the annular cavity vane (straight, positive curved and negative curved vanes) have been designed and investigated. The purpose of the annular cavity vane technique is to remove some of the positive swirl that can be carried through the bleed slot system, which would influence the pressure ratio. In addition to this, the series of cavity vanes provides better guidance to the slot recirculating flow before it mixes with the impeller main inlet flow. Better guidance of the flow improves the mixing at the inducer inlet in the circumferential direction. As a consequence, the stability of the compressor is improved at lower flow rates and a wider map can be achieved. The impact of these three cavity vane designs on the map width and performance of the compressor has been highlighted through a detailed analysis of the impeller and cavity vane bleed slot flow field. Interestingly, all three types of cavity vane showed an improvement in map width by moving the surge point to a lower mass flow rate with no significant efficiency penalty over the entire operating range. This improvement was most evident at the highest running speed. In particular, the negative curved vane showed a significant increase in map width which re{{presents an}} extra 67 % improvement in map width that was achieved between the baseline bleed slot and non-bleed slot configurations.
