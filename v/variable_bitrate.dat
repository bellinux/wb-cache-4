25|$|A more {{sophisticated}} MP3 encoder can produce <b>variable</b> <b>bitrate</b> audio. MPEG audio may use bitrate switching on a per-frame basis, but only layer III decoders must support it. VBR is used when {{the goal is}} to achieve a fixed level of quality. The final file size of a VBR encoding is less predictable than with constant bitrate. Average bitrate is a type of VBR implemented as a compromise between the two: the bitrate is allowed to vary for more consistent quality, but is controlled to remain near an average value chosen by the user, for predictable file sizes. Although an MP3 decoder must support VBR to be standards compliant, historically some decoders have bugs with VBR decoding, particularly before VBR encoders became widespread. The most evolved LAME MP3 encoder supports the generation of VBR, ABR, and even the ancient CBR MP3 formats.|$|E

With our new approach (focussing of MPEG 2 with <b>variable</b> <b>bitrates)</b> the resource usage compared to fixed-bandwidth allocation can be significantly decreased.

50|$|ACM is {{considered}} an outdated framework/API and Microsoft now encourages the use of at least DirectShow. However, unlike ACM and the related Video Compression Manager (VCM), DirectShow provides no means to encode files for end-users but requires developers to build end-to-end graphs for encoding content. ACM also does not support VBR audio streams; therefore newer codecs like MPEG-4 AAC, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC etc. cannot be supported through ACM if using <b>variable</b> <b>bitrates.</b> Though many sources state the contrary, Ogg Vorbis does work well with the ACM, e.g. when embedded in a RIFF-compatible file (such as a WAV or AVI file as mentioned earlier), provided the Ogg Vorbis stream is encoded at a constant bitrate.|$|R

30|$|A key {{characteristic}} of the MPEG- 4 SLS standard is the scalability property which enables the coding and transmission of the enhancement data at <b>variable</b> <b>bitrates,</b> thus allowing for variable audio quality improvement. This scalability is achieved by creating additional encoding stages for the residual signal. In each stage, {{a subset of the}} residual signal is encoded through bit-plane coding schemes based on the Bit-Plane Golomb Code (BPGC) [7]. The MPEG- 4 SLS method and previous methods on scalable encoding [8 – 10] generally follow a cascaded residual coding approach, in which the residual signal of one encoding stage is the input to another encoding stage. Since we do not employ this residual coding approach, we have devised an alternative scalability scheme that works in conjunction with our conversion-based method and allows for variable bit rate during transmission of the enhancement parameters.|$|R
40|$|In video {{transmission}} over packet data networks, {{it may be}} desirable to adapt the coding rate according to bandwidth availability. Classical approaches to rate adaptation are bitstream switching, requiring the storage of several pre-coded versions of a video, or layered (scalable) video coding, which has coding efficiency and/or complexity penalties. In this {{paper we propose a}} new GOP-level rate adaptation scheme for a single stream, <b>variable</b> target <b>bitrate</b> H. 264 encoder; this allows each group of pictures (GOP) to be encoded at a specified bitrate. We first compare the performance of the standard H. 264 rate control algorithm with the proposed one in the case of constant target bitrate. Then, we present results on how close the new technique can track a specified per-GOP target bitrate schedule. Results show that the proposed approach can obtain the desired target rates with less than 5 % error...|$|R

Application specific source coding schemes for the sensor networks provide fewer bits to represent {{the same amount of}} information exploiting the redundancy present in the source model, network architecture and the physical process. This paper reports the performance of representative codes from various families of source coding schemes (lossless, lossy, constant <b>bitrate,</b> <b>variable</b> bit-rate, distributed and joint encoding/decoding) in terms of energy consumed, bit-rate achieved, quantizationerror/reconstruction-error, latency and complexity of encoderdecoder(codec).

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{research}} has been pursued on all aspects of streaming media. While many theoretical results {{have been reported in}} the literature, few performance results of large-scale systems have been published. In this report we specifically explore the scalability aspects of our Yima streaming media architecture in an end-to-end test environment. With Yima it was our goal to design and implement an architecture that would scale in performance from small to large systems. Some of the design features include 1) a multi-node cluster architecture based on commodity hardware and custom software, 2) media type independence (support ranges from 500 Kb/s MPEG- 4 to 45 Mb/s HDTV, at both <b>variable</b> and constant <b>bitrates),</b> 3) fine-grained online scale up/down capabilities, and 4) a client-controlled rate smoothing protocol. We briefly discuss the design and implementation of these capabilities of Yima and then thoroughly evaluate its scalability through several sets of experiments. Our results show that Yima scales linearly (within the range of our test parameters) as a function of the cluster size and also as a function of available resources such as network bandwidth and CPU performance. key words: Streaming media, continuous media, multimedia servers 1...|$|R

5000|$|Average bitrate {{can also}} {{refer to a}} form of <b>variable</b> <b>bitrate</b> (VBR) {{encoding}} in which the encoder will try to reach a target average bitrate or file size while allowing the bitrate to vary between different parts of the audio or video. As it is a form of <b>variable</b> <b>bitrate,</b> this allows more complex portions of the material to use more bits and less complex areas to use fewer bits. However, bitrate will not vary as much as in <b>variable</b> <b>bitrate</b> encoding. [...] At a given bitrate, VBR is usually higher quality than ABR, which is higher quality than CBR (constant bitrate). [...] ABR encoding is desirable for users who want the general benefits of VBR encoding (an optimum bitrate from frame to frame) but with a relatively predictable file size. [...] Two-pass encoding is usually needed for accurate ABR encoding, as on the first pass the encoder has no way of knowing what parts of the audio or video need the highest bitrates to be encoded.|$|E
