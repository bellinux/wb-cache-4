50|$|An {{early winter}} in the North Pacific in September 1871 forced the captains of an American whaling fleet in the Arctic to abandon their ships, in {{what became known as}} the Whaling Disaster of 1871. With 32 <b>vessels</b> <b>trapped</b> in the ice and {{provisions}} insufficient to weather the nine-month winter, the captains ordered the abandonment of the ships and the three million dollars' worth of property carried on board but in the process saved the lives of over 1,200 men, women, and children.|$|R

50|$|Heron's {{fountain}} is {{a device}} invented by Heron of Alexandria {{that consists of}} a jet of fluid being fed by a reservoir of fluid. The fountain is constructed {{in such a way}} that the height of the jet exceeds the height of the fluid in the reservoir, apparently in violation of principles of hydrostatic pressure. The device consisted of an opening and two containers arranged one above the other. The intermediate pot, which was sealed, was filled with fluid, and several cannula (a small tube for transferring fluid between vessels) connecting the various <b>vessels.</b> <b>Trapped</b> air inside the vessels induces a jet of water out of a nozzle, emptying all water from the intermediate reservoir.|$|R

30|$|Theoretically, UAE may {{contribute}} to difficulties in embryo implantation or maintenance of pregnancy by decreasing vascularity of the uterine myometrium and endometrium. In fact, embolization particles have been identified after UAE in structures adjacent to leiomyomas (myometrium, parametrium, mesovarium) [14]. Most often, myometrium adjacent to embolized leiomyomas is spared from tissue necrosis. In addition, there generally {{does not seem to}} be any significant histologic impact on the endometrium, presumably because myometrial <b>vessels</b> <b>trap</b> particles before arrival in the endometrium. Colgan and colleagues [15] reported cervical necrosis, necrotizing myometritis, endomyometritis, or acute endometritis in five of eight hysterectomy specimens that were performed for complications after 555 UAE procedures. Therefore, although the overall risk seems to be low, there is a concern that UAE could produce a deleterious impact on myometrium and endometrium.|$|R
50|$|While it was {{originally}} proposed that NETs would be formed in tissues at a site of bacterial/yeast infection, NETs have {{also been shown to}} form within blood vessels during sepsis (specifically in the lung capillaries and liver sinusoids). Intra-vascular NET formation is tightly controlled and is regulated by platelets, which sense severe infection via platelet TLR4 and then bind to and activate neutrophils to form NETs. Platelet-induced NET formation occurs very rapidly (in minutes) and may or may not result in death of the neutrophils. NETs formed in blood vessels can catch circulating bacteria as they pass through the <b>vessels.</b> <b>Trapping</b> of bacteria under flow has been imaged directly in flow chambers in vitro and intravital microscopy demonstrated that bacterial trapping occurs in the liver sinusoids and lung capillaries (sites where platelets bind neutrophils).|$|R

40|$|The “E. B. Barber” (Canada 194458) {{was built}} in 1953 by the Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. of Port Arthur, Ontario, Canada. The steel {{propeller}} vessel was owned by Algoma Central Railway, Ltd., of Sault St. Marie, Ont., from 1953 until 1985. During the winter of 1963 - 1964, she was converted into self-unloader by Collingwood Shipyards, Ltd. of Collingwood, Ont. Later that year, the vessel experienced severe bottom damage at Depot Harbor, Ont. On February 12, 1975, an engine room fire broke out while in Port Colborne, Ont. In September 1981, she collided with “Lewis Wilson Foy” near Soo Locks; no major damage was reported. During the winter 1983, the vessel was one of fourteen <b>vessels</b> <b>trapped</b> in Detroit River due to ice. In early August 1985, she arrived in Vigo, Spain, where she was demolished by Miguel Martins Pereira at Guixar-Vigo...|$|R
50|$|Anchor Point {{was first}} settled by Robert Bartlett, a British seaman, and his nephew Robert Genge, both from Yeovil, Somerset, England in 1740. They used the cove {{as a base}} for fishing and fur hunting from Anchor Point to Bartlett's Harbour in the late 18th century. Robert Bartlett {{eventually}} returned to England while Robert Genge was joined by his brother Abram, who employed men from England seasonally to sell his furs and fish to American <b>vessels.</b> <b>Trapping,</b> salmon fishing and sealing were very important industries of Anchor Point in the 19th century. His descendant, William Genge, was the first Waymaster in 1885. By the 1850s, Anchor Point was established as a commercial center for fur trading and fishing on the St. Barbe coast. The land around Anchor Point was also very productive with excellent pasture which led to extensive cultivation of the land and the raising of livestock.|$|R

50|$|The game {{is divided}} into two parts; one in which the player {{controls}} the seaQuest in an isometric perspective overworld and is able to buy equipment and weapons and travel the ocean quadrant, and horizontal scrolling shooter style missions, in which the player must achieve various objectives using a complement of mini-subs, robots, and a trained dolphin wearing an aqua-lung. Some of the missions are simplistic and require the player to make use of only one of the seaQuest's vessels; others have the player make use of several of them in succession. For example, there's a mission in the first ocean quadrants where the player must rescue the crew of an exploration <b>vessel</b> <b>trapped</b> in a caved-in underwater cave, and has to use armed subs to clear several cave-ins before they can bring in the only mini-sub that's equipped to rescue personnel from other subs. The missions also typically involve combat between the player's mini-subs and the units of pirates, eco-terrorists, and other foes, but also more often than not require the player to perform some sort of non-combat task such as the aforementioned rescue operation.|$|R
50|$|The {{accident}} control facility of the VVER-TOI project {{includes a}} corium trap, a unique Russian safety technology, which provides the guaranteed safety control through melt localizing and cooling {{in the terms}} of a severe accident at the beyond-vessel stage of core-melt localization. Within the frame of VVER-TOI, there are performed the works directed toward optimization of technical solutions made for corium trap project to decrease cost indicators and justify the corium trap operation efficiency. It is supposed to achieve a considerable decrease in the <b>trap</b> <b>vessel</b> overall sizes and sacrificed materials weight, as well as to transfer to module design of the <b>trap</b> <b>vessel</b> that make it possible to simplify transportation of the large-sized equipment to the site of NPP construction.|$|R

25|$|The 1901 {{winter season}} began mildly, but a sudden drop in {{temperatures}} in February {{led to some}} of the worst conditions on the Delaware in memory. Ice Boat No. 3 was placed in commission on 5 February, the other two ice boats re-entering service on the 6th and 8th respectively. Ice Boat No. 3 spent most of the night of the 5th clearing ice in the Horseshoe, and on 7 February, No. 2 and No. 3 successfully refloated the steamer Switzerland, ashore on Chester Island. In the afternoon of 21 February No. 3 refloated the barge Baker, aground in the Shoe, and on 26 February refloated the ship Bengalore, ashore at Cherry Island Flats. The following day, the three ice boats worked together in the Horseshoe to free 21 <b>vessels</b> <b>trapped</b> in ice, and on 1 March, another 41 vessels were freed by the ice boats. With conditions rapidly improving, Ice Boat No. 1 was decommissioned on 6 March, followed by No. 2 and No. 3 on 7 and 9 March respectively, the crews of all three boats being paid and discharged and the boats returned to the City Ice Boat Dept. caretakers in accordance with standard procedure. Of the three ice boats, No. 3 spent the longest time in commission for the season, recording 34 days in full commission and another 40 days in commission with half crew.|$|R

25|$|Warm {{winters in}} the Gulf of Saint Lawrence {{have led to}} thinner and more {{unstable}} ice there. In 2007, Canada's federal fisheries ministry reported that while the pups are born on the ice as usual, the ice floes have started to break up before the pups learn to swim, causing the pups to drown. Canada reduced the 2007 quota by 20%, because overflights showed large numbers of seal pups were lost to thin and melting ice. In southern Labrador and off Newfoundland's northeast coast, however, there was extra heavy ice in 2007, and the coast guard estimated as many as 100 <b>vessels</b> were <b>trapped</b> in ice simultaneously.|$|R
