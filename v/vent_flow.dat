The hybrid model comprised two integrated models: a zone and a network model. The two-zone model was developed to simulate fire and smoke movement inside the room of fire-origin and neighboring compartments. The network model capable of predicting both mass and energy flow is used to simulate smoke movement {{into the rest of}} the compartments that are far away from the fire-origin room. The two models were combined to produce a hybrid model that allows an accurate simulation offire dynamics in both the near- and far-field. The paper illustrates the different steps of the development of the model. In a subsequent paper, the implementation of the developed hybrid model for different buildings will be discussed.

Both collections and images taken along transects document the small-scale abundance patterns of each species {{with respect to}} temperature and distance from <b>vent</b> <b>flows.</b> Lepetodrilus fucensis and Depressigyra globulus were most abundant at distances from <b>vent</b> <b>flows</b> of 0 to 25 cm in warm fluids with high temperature variability (10 ± 5 °C) over several time scales. Both species were also abundant at 26 to 50 cm, where temperatures were lower with less variability (4 ± 1 °C). Provanna variabilis was most abundant from 51 to 75 cm, where temperatures were stable (3 ± 0. 5 °C). All species were absent where maximum fluid temperatures reached 18 °C and their substratum coverage was related to temperature. When presented with a choice in vent fluids from 10 to 2 °C, L. fucensis and D. globulus moved to areas with temperatures above 5 °C, while P. variabilis showed no preference. In species-specific temperature preference experiments, L. fucensis and D. globulus aggregated between 5 and 13 °C, while P. variabilis occupied areas with significantly lower temperatures from 4 to 11 °C. These experimental temperature preferences correspond with their thermal environments. Upper temperature limits are moderate; extreme abiotic variability in higher temperature fluids may constrain these 3 species. We conclude thermal conditions are a primary determinant of habitat selection, thereby driving gastropod abundance patterns. However, other factors likely contribute. Space competition nearest <b>vent</b> <b>flows</b> may result in the displacement of individuals of these species to low quality habitats...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the details used to model a post-flashover fire compartment as a well-stirred reactor. In particular, it examines the two foremost important variables that dictate post-flashover fire behaviour inside the fire compartment. These two variables are: (1) the {{mass flow rate}} of air into the compartment via the vent opening and (2) the fuel mass loss rate inside the compartment. The <b>vent</b> <b>flow</b> analysis shows that the orifice analogy typically used to describe compartment <b>vent</b> <b>flow</b> is restricted to small wall opening applications. For large wall openings, such as a window occupying one whole wall, the flow rate is dictated by the plume entrainment with a flow rate - 60 % of the flow rate estimated from the orifice theory. A series of fire experiments using a reduced-scale compartment were conducted to study the <b>vent</b> <b>flow</b> behaviour in a compartment with a horizontal roof opening and a vertical wall opening. Based on the analytical and experimental studies, it is shown {{that in the case}} where the roof vent opening is not excessively large and a wall opening having a small downstand, the neutral-plane exists below the soffit of the wall opening giving outflow and inflow through the wall opening and outflow through the roof opening. In such a case, the flows through these openings can be adequately described using an extended form of the <b>vent</b> <b>flow</b> formulation that includes the roof vent opening. The area of the roof vent and the depth of the downstand between the ceiling and the soffit of the wall opening are found to be significant in determining the extra air inflow induced due to the existence of the roof vent opening. The cellulosic and pool fuels each have different burning behaviour inside a compartment. However, compartment fire temperatures and fuel mass loss rates, from both fuel types, are strongly dependent on the available fuel surface area to ventilation opening ratio and the fuel surface to enclosure area ratio. In the case of thermoplastic pool fires, the ratio between the heat of combustion of air for the fuel and the heat of gasification of the fuel is also found to be influential on the resulting fires. A post-flashover fire computer program, CFIRE, has been developed that incorporates these findings. The simulation studies performed using the CFIRE computer program show that the fire time-temperature histories of wood fires are highly dependent on the remaining fuel surface area over time. In the case of thin wood, a shorter and hotter fire is expected as it has greater surface area than thick wood, even with the same fuel load. The study also shows that for small ventilation opening, a pool fire inside a fire compartment is less severe than a wood fire because the thermoplastic fuel is easily vaporised under the radiation feedback from the hot surrounding environment and discharged outside the compartment. In the case of large openings, pool fires are more likely to produce a hotter fire in the compartment than wood fires because wood fuel would not have sufficient fuel surface area to achieve ventilation controlled burning. By comparing these simulated fires with the Eurocode parametric fires, the Eurocode parametric fires do not provide realistic decay rate. With the modified parametric fires, these fires are conservative as they provide envelopes for the simulated fire curves. However, these parametric fires do not clearly describe the fire behaviour of realistic furnishing inside the fire compartment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe risk of leakage along {{existing}} wellbores {{associated with}} CO 2 sequestration depends strongly upon the leakage path permeabilities. If enough buildups of surface casing pressure (SCP) {{and rates of}} surface casing <b>vent</b> <b>flow</b> (SCVF) recorded on intermediate wellbore casing strings are available, a frequency distribution of leakage path permeability values can be obtained. Uncertainty about {{the location of the}} leak source results in a range of leakage path permeability values for each measurement of SCP or SCVF. Most permeability values exceed intact cement permeability, consistent with the presence of cracks or other defects in the formation/cement/casing interface. Assuming the gas migration path through leaky wellbores in hydrocarbon reservoirs is analogous to the leakage path for CO 2 plumes, the distribution of inferred permeabilities enables quantitative estimation of CO 2 leakage fluxes...|$|E
40|$|Since fluidic {{devices have}} not {{mechanical}} movable parts, {{it is well}} known that one of the most distinguishing characters of these devices is that they are not influenced by mechanical vibration, but it can be thought that some effects are created by mechanical vibration so long as the behaviours of these devices depend on a dynamical motion. Then, in this paper, an experimental research is performed by vibrating some wall attachment amplifiers with pentagonal splitter to three directions, parallel to the main jet flow (Y-direction), parallel to the <b>vented</b> <b>flow</b> (X-direction), perpendicular to both the main jet and the <b>vented</b> <b>flow</b> (Z-direction). Air is used as working fluid and the frequency is varied from 0 to 50 Hz.

The effect of vibration to X- and Z- direct 1 on is comparatively remarkable in the case of a small quantity of both a supply flow and a control pressure, but it almost vanishes as the supply flow and / or the control pressure increases. 　Further experimental research is performed by changing the size of devices.

Also, flow rate through an exhaust decreases as volume of the structure increases. In a larger volume more leakage can be expected, thus decreasing the efficiency of positive pressure ventilation.

When heating systems are in use during cold winter months hot air from a floor-mounted vent located below a window will often flow over the cold window. The nature of the air-flow pattern over the window tends to be changed {{by the presence of}} the <b>vent</b> <b>flow</b> thus altering the rate of convective heat transfer to the window. The effect of the <b>vent</b> <b>flow</b> on the convective heat transfer rate from the window will be influenced by the presence of a blind system over the window. In recent times top-down, bottom-up plane blind systems in which the blind can both be raised at the bottom and lowered at the top have become popular. In the present study the effect of the hot air flow from a below window vent on the heat transfer rate from a recessed cold window covered by a top-down, bottom-up plane blind system has been numerically studied. The window, represented by a plane isothermal section recessed into the wall, is colder than the room air far from the window. It is assumed that the floor-mounted vent is located against the wall and has a uniform discharge velocity which is normal to the vent surface. The flow has been assumed to be steady. Situations involving both laminar and turbulent flow have been considered. The fluid properties have been assumed constant except for the density change with temperature that gives rise to the buoyancy forces. This was dealt with using the Boussinesq approach. Radiant heat transfer effects have been neglected. The governing equations have been solved using the commercial CFD code ANSYS FLUENT©. The k-epsilon turbulence model with buoyancy force effects fully accounted for was used. Results have been obtained for a Prandtl number of 0. 74, i. e., effectively the value for air.

Every study on this topic has attracted considerable interest, and the paper of Ricci et al. cannot be overlooked [1].
