5|$|The central adrenomedullary vein, in the adrenal medulla, is {{an unusual}} type of blood vessel. Its {{structure}} {{is different from the}} other <b>veins</b> <b>in</b> that the smooth muscle in its tunica media (the middle layer of the vessel) is arranged in conspicuous, longitudinally oriented bundles.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} their area forming the wing membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future <b>veins,</b> <b>in</b> which the nerves and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
5|$|CSF pressure, as {{measured}} by lumbar puncture, is 10–18 cmH2O (8–15 mmHg or 1.1–2 kPa) with the patient lying {{on the side and}} 20–30 cmH2O (16–24 mmHg or 2.1–3.2 kPa) with the patient sitting up. In newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10 cmH2O (4.4–7.3mmHg or 0.78–0.98kPa). Most variations are due to coughing or internal compression of jugular <b>veins</b> <b>in</b> the neck. When lying down, the CSF pressure as estimated by lumbar puncture is similar to the intracranial pressure.|$|E

In mammals, where a subarachnoid space is present, the CSF is present in it. Absorption of CSF is seen in amniotes and more complex species, and as species become progressively more complex, the system of absorption becomes progressively more enhanced, and the role of spinal epidural <b>veins</b> <b>in</b> absorption plays a progressively smaller and smaller role.|$|E

40|$|A veia gástrica {{posterior}} não é muito citada nos livros de anatomia e nos trabalhos sobre hipertensão porta. Estudou-se sua anatomia, freqüência e desembocadura. Ela foi encontrada em 54 % dos casos e, em 100 %, desembocava na veia esplênica. Discute-se a vantagem ou não de sua ligadura ou preservação no tratamento cirúrgico da hipertensão porta. The posterior gastric vein has {{not been}} mentioned very often neither in anatomy textbooks nor in portal hypertension papers. The authors studied the anatomy, frequency and confluence of this vein because is a huge variety in the presentation of esophageal varices. Twenty-six adult preserved corpses (twenty females and six males) had a wide abdominal incision allowing the dissection of the portal system, identifying the frequency and confluence of its tributaries, notably the posterior gastric vein. The portal <b>vein,</b> <b>in</b> all cases, was formed by {{the confluence of the}} superior mesenteric vein with the splenic vein and had a mean length of 6. 4 cm. The splenic vein had a mean length of 6. 5 cm. The left gastric vein was tributary of the portal <b>vein</b> <b>in</b> 50 % of the cases and in 30 % of the cases <b>in</b> the splenic <b>vein.</b> The right gastric vein had it's confluence to portal <b>vein</b> <b>in</b> 30 % of the cases and to the splenic <b>vein</b> <b>in</b> 4 %. The inferior mesenteric vein was tributary of the splenic <b>vein</b> <b>in</b> 54 % of the cases and in the superior mesenteric <b>vein</b> <b>in</b> 46 %. The left gastro-omental vein had its confluence to the splenic <b>vein</b> <b>in</b> 50 % of the cases and to the inferior polar <b>vein</b> <b>in</b> 34 %. The middle colic vein had its confluence to superior mesenteric <b>vein</b> <b>in</b> 42 % of the cases, to inferior mesenteric <b>vein</b> <b>in</b> 12 % and to splenic <b>vein</b> <b>in</b> 8 %. The posterior gastric <b>vein</b> was found <b>in</b> 54 % of the corpses, and in all cases it was a tributary of the splenic <b>vein,</b> <b>in</b> retropancreatic position, coming from the esophageal-gastric junction. These findings agree with previous papers describing a prevalence of 60 % of posterior gastric <b>vein</b> <b>in</b> patients submitted to surgery in portal hypertension, and in all cases, this vein was tributary of the splenic vein. The identification of this vein may influence the treatment, because if left untied during cases of portal-azigos disconnection, they may predispose to postoperative bleeding, but in cases of splenorenal anastomosis may preserve its patency in cases of anastomosis occlusion, or can lead again to postoperative bleeding feeding the esophageal varices. To ligate or not this vein will depends on the surgeon 's experience and common sense. Regarding to previous papers and to this data presented here, the authors believe that the prevalence of this vein is between 50 and 60 % in the population...|$|R

Until {{the second half of the}} 20th century it remained a diagnosis generally made after death. In the 1940s, reports by Dr Charles Symonds and others allowed for the clinical diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis, using characteristic signs and symptoms and results of lumbar puncture.|$|E
5|$|Venous {{insufficiency}} {{results when}} the vein dilates secondary to a vein wall disease or when normal {{functioning of the}} valves, which serve to keep blood flowing to the heart and to prevent reflux, become damaged and/or incompetent (the dilation of a vein will prevent valves to close properly). This incompetence will result in an reversed blood flow through the affected vein or <b>veins.</b> <b>In</b> varicose veins the valves are damaged, disfunction or missing and the insufficiency will be chronic. The reversed blood pools in the low third of legs and feet.|$|E
5|$|Most {{veins and}} crossveins {{occur in the}} {{anterior}} area of the remigium, {{which is responsible for}} most of the flight, powered by the thoracic muscles. The posterior portion of the remigium is sometimes called the clavus; the two other posterior fields are the anal and jugal ares. When the vannal fold has the usual position anterior to the group of anal veins, the remigium contains the costal, subcostal, radial, medial, cubital, and postcubital <b>veins.</b> <b>In</b> the flexed wing the remigiumturns posteriorly on the flexible basal connection of the radius with the second axillary, and the base of the mediocubital field is folded medially on the axillary region along the plica basalis (bf) between the median plates (m, m') of the wing base.|$|E

We examined postural changes of femoral <b>vein</b> velocity <b>in</b> order to elucidate the mechanism. Thirty patients scheduled for general thoracic surgery were enrolled in this study. The common femoral veins on both sides were examined by color-duplex ultrasound for venous caliber and velocity when the patients were in the right lateral, left lateral, and supine positions. The maximum diameters of the right femoral <b>vein</b> <b>in</b> the right lateral decubitus position and the left femoral <b>vein</b> <b>in</b> the left decubitus position were significantly larger than those in the other positions. The venous velocity of the right femoral <b>vein</b> <b>in</b> the right lateral decubitus position was significantly smaller than that in the supine position, while the velocity of the left femoral <b>vein</b> <b>in</b> the left lateral decubitus position was not significantly decreased.

5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has played}} an enormous role in refining the wings, control and sensory systems, {{and anything else}} that affects aerodynamics or kinematics. One noteworthy trait is wing twist. Most insect wings are twisted, as are helicopter blades, with a higher angle of attack at the base. The twist generally is between 10 and 20 degrees. In addition to this twist, the wing surfaces are not necessarily flat or featureless; most larger insects have wing membranes distorted and angled between the <b>veins</b> <b>in</b> {{such a way that the}} cross-section of the wings approximates an airfoil. Thus, the wing's basic shape already is capable of generating a small amount of lift at zero angle of attack. Most insects control their wings by adjusting tilt, stiffness, and flapping frequency of the wings with tiny muscles in the thorax (below). Some insects evolved other wing features that are not advantageous for flight, but play a role in something else, such as mating or protection.|$|E

5|$|The third {{axillary}} sclerite (3Ax) lies in {{the posterior}} part of the articular region of the wing. Its form is highly variable and often irregular, but the third axillary is the sclerite on which is inserted the flexor muscle of the wing (D). Mesally it articulates anteriorly (f) with the posterior {{end of the second}} axillary, and posteriorly (b) with the posterior wing process of the tergum (PNP), or with a small fourth axillary when the latter is present. Distally the third axillary is prolonged in a process which is always associated with the bases of the group of <b>veins</b> <b>in</b> the anal region of the wing here termed the vannal veins (V). The third axillary, therefore, is usually the posterior hinge plate of the wing base and is the active sclerite of the flexor mechanism, which directly manipulates the vannal veins. The contraction of the flexor muscle (D) revolves the third axillary on its mesal articulations (b, f) and thereby lifts its distal arm; this movement produces the flexion of the wing. The Fourth Axillary sclerite is not a constant element of the wing base. When present it is usually a small plate intervening between the third axillary and the posterior notal wing process and is probably a detached piece of the latter.|$|E
