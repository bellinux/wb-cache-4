5|$|In 1964, <b>VAT</b> {{had started}} to seek a {{stronger}} partner when it negotiated with AB Scania-Vabis. The companies planned to use Scania engines in Vanaja vehicles but the plan proved too expensive for <b>VAT.</b> This may have led the major owners of <b>VAT</b> to start discussions about merging <b>VAT</b> and SAT. The chairman of <b>VAT</b> held regular meetings with the SAT manager Tor Nessling. In 1967, AB Scania-Vabis expressed its interest in <b>VAT</b> and German company Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG was interested in co-operation with, or acquisition of, <b>VAT.</b> Valmet is also rumoured to {{have been interested in}} <b>VAT</b> but {{there is no evidence of}} concrete negotiations.|$|E
5|$|<b>VAT</b> used Valmet gearboxes, {{which were}} copied from the {{transmissions}} {{made by the}} American company Fuller in the late 1940s and the early 1950s. When components became more easily available, <b>VAT</b> started to use genuine Fullers and ZF-made gearboxes. The transfer cases were supplied by Timken and ZF. <b>VAT</b> built the rear axles from gears made by ATA until the company started buying axles from Timken.|$|E
5|$|Although Jersey {{does not}} have <b>VAT,</b> the States of Jersey {{introduced}} a goods and services tax (GST) on 6 May 2008, at a standard rate of 3%. The rate was amended to 5% on 1 June 2011. Although GST is at 5%, shopping in Jersey is still far more expensive than in the UK. Food is not exempt, unlike with <b>VAT.</b>|$|E
50|$|The winery uses {{stainless}} steel <b>vats</b> with temperature control. It currently has twenty-three 70,000 liter <b>vats</b> and nine 25,000 liter <b>vats.</b> The bottling plant has {{a capacity of}} 6,000 bottles per hour.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vats</b> Church (<b>Vats</b> kyrkje) is {{a parish}} church in Vindafjord {{municipality}} in Rogaland county, Norway. It {{is located in}} the village of <b>Vats</b> {{at the southern end of}} the lake Vatsvatnet. The church is part of the <b>Vats</b> parish in the Haugaland deanery in the Diocese of Stavanger. The white, wooden church was built in 1855 using designs by the architect Hans Linstow.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vats</b> is {{a former}} {{municipality}} in Rogaland county, Norway. Located in the traditional district of Haugaland, the municipality existed from 1891 until 1965. The 124 km2 municipality encompassed the land {{to the east and}} west surrounding the Vatsfjorden and the lake Vatsvatnet. <b>Vats</b> is typically divided into two parts Øvre <b>Vats</b> (around the lake in the north) and Nedre <b>Vats</b> (around the fjord in the south).|$|R
5|$|<b>VAT</b> {{delivered}} {{its first}} mid-engined bus chassis to Ajokki Oy coach works in April 1958. It was {{powered by a}} horizontally mounted 164-hp AEC diesel engine. The end customer was bus operator Väinö Paunu Oy, which also participated in the development work. In 1960, <b>VAT</b> introduced the VLK500 chassis with air suspension and dual-circuit air brakes. <b>VAT</b> returned to building rear-engined buses in 1966–67, but sales did not reach {{the level of the}} mid- and front-engined models. The company conducted a number of experiments with the construction; one example was a bus with a frameless structure in which the beams were replaced by a lighter solution.|$|E
5|$|Because {{value added}} tax (<b>VAT)</b> {{has not been}} levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, {{providing}} an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of <b>VAT</b> has also led {{to the growth of}} the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding <b>VAT</b> on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. Low-value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.|$|E
5|$|Bus chassis {{production}} {{began in}} 1950. <b>VAT</b> {{made the first}} prototypes of rear-engined buses in 1956. The company made two prototype chassis, which were designated model VAT-4800; the superstructures were made by coach builders Ajokki Oy and Nummela Oy. The solution caused several technical problems, including proper cooling and transfer of heating to {{the front end of}} the body. The cooling problem was finally solved by a large air scoop located at the back of the roof; this was not regarded as an aesthetically pleasing arrangement. As the solution was found, <b>VAT</b> produced ten more rear-engined chassis called type VAT-5200.|$|E
50|$|Fermentation {{usually takes}} place in {{stainless}} steel <b>vats,</b> a technique introduced in the 1960s (lined cement <b>vats</b> were introduced already in the 1920s), to improve hygiene and control over the fermentation process (especially of temperature). During the 1980s, some producers began reintroducing wooden fermentation <b>vats.</b> There are pros and cons with all types of <b>vats,</b> and their role in winemaking seems less important than other elements in the process.|$|R
50|$|In 1925, <b>Vats</b> was {{promoted}} to Superintendent of Northern Circle and he supervised the excavations at Harappa till 1934-35. Shortly after retirements, <b>Vats</b> published {{the results of their}} excavations.|$|R
50|$|The George Dickel {{distillery}} uses deeper (13 foot) <b>vats</b> and distills to 135 proof. Dickel chills its whisky to 40 degrees F (5 °C) {{before it}} enters the <b>vats,</b> and allows the whiskey to fill the <b>vats</b> instead of trickling it through. The distillery claims that these differences yield a better filtering process, as Dickel found he made more pleasing whisky during the cooler winter months.|$|R
5|$|Speculation about {{a merger}} between SAT and <b>VAT</b> began in Swedish {{newspapers}} in 1967 {{and was soon}} {{picked up by the}} Finnish media. The major owner, the state of Finland with its 45% share, suggested a merger to Nessling in December 1967. The financial situation of <b>VAT</b> was unsustainable; the whole year's turnover was 19.5 million new Finnish marks when the company had debts of 14.5 million; 100 old Finnish marks became 1 new mark in 1963. The contract for the merger of Suomen Autoteollisuus and Vanajan Autotehdas was signed on 30 May 1968. <b>VAT</b> was formally discontinued at the end of 1968. After the merger, the state owned 17.2% of the new SAT, becoming the third-largest shareholder of the company.|$|E
5|$|The Codex Vaticanus (The Vatican, Bibl. <b>Vat.,</b> <b>Vat.</b> gr. 1209; no. B or 03 Gregory-Aland, δ 1 von Soden) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} extant manuscripts of the Greek Bible (Old and New Testament), one of the four great uncial codices. The Codex is named after its place of {{conservation}} in the Vatican Library, where it has been kept since at least the 15th century. It is written on 759 leaves of vellum in uncial letters and has been dated palaeographically to the 4th century.|$|E
5|$|The merger {{led to a}} {{clash of}} two {{organisational}} cultures. While <b>VAT</b> had a flat organisation, open communication among its workforce and a spirit of togetherness, SAT's organisation was strictly hierarchical. The division of portfolios between Karis and Hämeenlinna was changed after the merger. Lorry production was gradually concentrated at Karis and Sisu-Hämeenlinna focused on producing mobile cranes, bus chassis, terminal tractors and military vehicles. Former <b>VAT</b> personnel had to increase production of the new portfolio and simultaneously adopt new processes, so it was {{three to four years}} before the Hämeenlinna factory could deliver results in line with its capacity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} of <b>vats</b> [...] "was prosecuted with great diligence and energy" [...] and approximately 2000000 ft of lumber was consumed annually {{for a period}} of several years in order to construct the <b>vats.</b>|$|R
50|$|In March 1920, <b>Vats</b> {{joined the}} Archaeological Survey of India with a Sanskrit {{scholarship}} and was deputed to officiate as Assistant Superintendent of Western Circle in 1923 when Assistant Superintendent G. C. Chandra acted as the Superintendent {{in the absence}} of Rakhaldas Banerjee. <b>Vats</b> began his term by deciphering newly discovered inscriptions at Karle. But soon afterwards, <b>Vats</b> diverted his attention to Mohenjodaro as the excavations there had been left incomplete.|$|R
5000|$|Rohit <b>Vats</b> of Hindustan Times {{rated the}} film three and {{half out of}} five stars, {{describing}} it as [...] "Stunning, gripping, edge-of-the-seat, shocking, engrossing". <b>Vats</b> praised the film for being successful as a suspense thriller.|$|R
5|$|<b>VAT</b> {{celebrated its}} 20th anniversary in 1963. All press {{releases}} and publications ignored {{the fact that}} its key competitor, SAT, had had a significant role in its foundation. Yhteissisu was not mentioned in any context.|$|E
5|$|VAT's {{positioning}} in the heavy-vehicle market strengthened in 1950 and {{the company}} started producing bus chassis. The same year, <b>VAT</b> introduced a new product familythe VK series. Production was disrupted by a three-month strike, {{as a result of}} which completion of some of the 150 state-ordered vehicles scheduled for delivery that year was delayed until the following year. Despite its difficulties <b>VAT</b> posted a profit of almost two million marks. By now, the company employed 106 workers.|$|E
5|$|After the {{original}} {{contract with the}} state was terminated, a new agreement {{for the production of}} 650 vehicles to be delivered between 1948 and 1952 was reached. The state helped production with a significant prepayment of 132 million marks. According to the contract, 150 vehicles were scheduled to be built in 1948. The company reached this target and made a further 11 vehicles for private use. 92 were sold under the name of Sisu S-22 or S-22K and 69 were badged as Vanaja V-48. 101 M2 Half-Tracks were sold. In 1948, <b>VAT</b> made a loss of 746,000 marks. In 1949, <b>VAT</b> made another 150 vehicles for the state and 37 vehicles for private operators; it produced 163 V-48s and 24 VaWhs. The company also sold 211 M2 Half-Tracks, allowing it to declare its first profit of 1.208 million marks, which was helped by a devaluation of the Finnish mark.|$|E
50|$|The {{molten glass}} {{would then be}} ladled into <b>vats</b> of water. The water removed {{chloride}} and sulfate impurities from the mixture. The process of remelting and placing the molten mixture into <b>vats</b> of water was repeated several times until the glass-makers were satisfied.|$|R

5|$|Both <b>VAT</b> and SAT were criticised in 1954 {{by heavy}} vehicle {{importers}} {{because the two}} companies had access to {{a large share of}} the limited foreign currency reserves for component supply. The importers' representatives said neither Sisu nor Vanaja were very domestic products and the vehicles the importers represented were actually more domestic because some assembly work was done in Finland. According to the Association of Vehicle Importers, the domestic vehicles cost between 30% and 80% more compared to imported ones. The following year, the government started to investigate possibilities for importing heavy vehicles in kit form to reduce foreign-currency expenditure. <b>VAT</b> and SAT expressed doubts about the viability of such production. In 1957, the government ended restrictions on the import of heavy vehicle chassis. Eventually, the prices of imported vehicles approached those of Sisu and Vanaja vehicles.|$|E
5|$|General Manager Eero Kytölä {{resigned}} {{from his position}} in 1962. DI Ilmari Karttunen, who had previously worked as factory superintendent, was appointed {{the new head of}} the company. He led <b>VAT</b> until 1967, when Jaakko Jarimo took the post.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, <b>VAT</b> {{became the}} {{representative}} for Ansaldo S.A. and Kämper-Motoren GmbH. Ansaldo offered engines of between 100hp and 8,000hp intended for marine and industrial applications. Kämper products delivered between 14hp and 150hp.

5|$|In 2007, of the 1,420 <b>VAT</b> {{registered}} enterprises 55% were in agriculture, forestry and fishing, 12% {{in manufacturing}} and construction, 12% in wholesale, retail and repairs, and 5% in hotels and restaurants. A further 5% were public service related. 55% of these businesses employ between 5 and 49 people.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish Defence Forces {{carried out}} a winter test for {{potential}} military vehicles in March 1958. 35candidate vehicles from the two domestic producers and various importers were driven around Finland. <b>VAT</b> sent four vehicles to the test, three of which were 4×4s and one was an ordinary, rear-wheel driven vehicle. During the five days' testing period, all vehicles were continuously fully loaded. For part of the journey, the vehicles had to tow an eight-ton field cannon. The vehicles were tested for off-road capabilities in even, -deep snow. One of the Vanajas was destroyed in an accident. The domestic vehicles performed well in the test; {{in some cases the}} rear-wheel driven Sisus and Vanajas outperformed the 4×4-driven foreign competitors. None of the vehicles were clearly better than the others but the result convinced the Defence Forces of the capabilities of the domestic vehicles and led to several deals for SAT and <b>VAT.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Vanaja petrol engines made by SAT and Tampella were {{outdated}} American engines built under licence. Customers wanted diesel engines, {{which were}} more powerful. The first Vanaja diesel models were powered by Kämper and Saurer engines. <b>VAT</b> also tested Südwerke's two-stroke diesel engines {{but only one}} such vehicle was built. Import licences for diesel engines were difficult to obtain and this constrained vehicle sales. In some cases, customers provided their own enginesfor example Volvo or Mercedes-Benz, which were mounted to their ordered vehicles on the assembly line. In 1955, <b>VAT</b> bought two batches of 6-cylinder 90-hp Leyland 0.350 diesel engines. These proved to be too inefficient, and the following year the company ordered a batch of 300 stronger Leylands made in the Netherlands by van Doorne's Automobilfabriek N.V.|$|E
