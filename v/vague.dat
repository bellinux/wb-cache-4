5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were angry {{about the fact that he}} had deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors that he was going to make himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were <b>vague,</b> and as such, their plan against him was <b>vague.</b> The fact that their motives were <b>vague,</b> and that they had no idea of what to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E

50|$|Major Lionel B. Holliday bred <b>Vaguely</b> Noble who was foaled in 1965. <b>Vaguely</b> Noble was by Vienna (GB) who won six {{races and}} £27,970 {{before he was}} {{exported}} to France and then to Japan. His dam was the Lancashire Oaks winner, Noble Lassie (GB) was by Nearco (ITY) from Belle Sauvage by Big Game. Noble Lassie was the dam of several other horses, but <b>Vaguely</b> Noble was her only graded stakes winner. <b>Vaguely</b> Noble was inbred to Hyperion {{in the third and}} fourth generation (3m x 4f) and also to Bahram in the fourth generation (4m x 4f).|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked more}} sharply at his host, as if <b>vaguely</b> {{suspicious}} of a trap; then not less <b>vaguely</b> he sighed. [...] "Well, it's what I came up for--to try you all. But do {{they live on}} that?" [...] he continued.|$|R

5|$|Any size {{estimate}} of A. fragillimus must be regarded with caution {{because of the}} lack of specimens or even detailed, accurate documentation of its fossils.

60|$|Hurlstone {{gazed at}} the speaker with a troubled air. It was once more the quaint benevolent figure whom he had <b>vaguely</b> noted among the other passengers, and as <b>vaguely</b> despised. He hesitated a moment, and then, half timidly, half reservedly, {{extended}} his hand.|$|R
50|$|Major Lionel B. Holliday died in 1965; as {{a two-year-old}} <b>Vaguely</b> Noble raced in the colours of the Major's son, Brook Holliday. <b>Vaguely</b> Noble was {{sold at the}} end of his two-year-old season and was {{subsequently}} owned by Americans Wilma Franklyn and Nelson Bunker Hunt.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vaguely</b> Noble was {{regarded}} as one of the best European gallopers of the post World War II-era after winning six of his nine starts in England and France for the equivalent of US$366,647 in prize-money, and earned a Timeform rating of 140. In 1968 a 25% share in <b>Vaguely</b> Noble was acquired for $1.25 million by John R. Gaines of Lexington, Kentucky to make this a world record stallion syndication valuation of $5 million. <b>Vaguely</b> Noble was sent to stand at stud at Gainesway Farm in Lexington.|$|R

5|$|Feynman tried LSD {{during his}} {{professorship}} at Caltech. He also tried marijuana and ketamine experiences at John Lilly's famed sensory deprivation tanks, {{as a way}} of studying consciousness.

5|$|Most {{academic}} sources {{maintain that}} the associations made between world events and Nostradamus's quatrains are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else are so <b>vague</b> as to render them useless as evidence of any genuine predictive power.|$|E
5|$|On March 22, 1982, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey held (536 F. Supp. 317, (1982)) {{that the}} New Jersey statute was not unconstitutionally <b>vague</b> {{and did not}} impermissibly {{infringe}} on union members' First Amendment rights.|$|E
5|$|Proposals from shipbuilders for two dreadnoughts (along with a {{possible}} third, to match Brazil should a third ship be ordered) and twelve destroyers were solicited in 1908 by open tender.

5|$|Testing the {{validity}} of astrology can be difficult, {{because there is no}} consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict. Most professional astrologers are paid to predict the future or describe a person's personality and life, but most horoscopes only make <b>vague</b> untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.|$|E
5|$|The {{description}} of what happens next is deliberately cryptic. Lucius reminds the reader that the uninitiated {{are not allowed to}} know the details of the mystery rites, before describing his experience in <b>vague</b> terms.|$|E
5|$|A chavrusa {{helps the}} student stay awake, keep his mind {{focused on the}} learning, sharpen his {{reasoning}} powers, develop his thoughts into words, and organize his thoughts into logical arguments. This type of learning also imparts precision and clarity into ideas that would otherwise remain <b>vague.</b> Having to listen to, analyze and respond to another's opinion inculcates respect for others. It is considered poor manners to interrupt one's chavrusa. The chavrusa relationship also strengthens the student's personal commitment to his studies, as he is loathe to disappoint or cancel on his chavrusa.|$|E

5|$|Artificial selection, the {{deliberate}} selective breeding of domestic animals, {{is being used}} to breed back recently extinct animals in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that resembles that extinct wildtype ancestor. A breeding-back (intraspecific) hybrid may be very similar to the extinct wildtype in appearance, ecological niche and to some extent genetics, but the initial gene pool of that wild type is lost forever with its extinction. As a result, bred-back breeds are at best <b>vague</b> look-alikes of extinct wildtypes, as Heck cattle are of the aurochs.|$|E
5|$|Cantharidin, the blister-causing oil {{found in}} several {{families}} of beetles {{described by the}} <b>vague</b> common name Spanish fly, was accepted by the FDA in 2004 as treatment for warts and other skin problems.

5|$|Classic {{learning}} {{theories and}} the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction of interesting, tangential details to learning content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of <b>vague</b> or uninteresting material.|$|E
