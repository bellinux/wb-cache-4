50|$|A {{plant cutting}} {{is a piece}} of a plant that is used in {{horticulture}} for <b>vegetative</b> (asexual) <b>propagation.</b> A piece of the stem or root of the source plant is placed in a suitable medium such as moist soil. If the conditions are suitable, the plant piece will begin to grow as a new plant independent of the parent, a process known as striking. A stem cutting produces new roots, and a root cutting produces new stems. Some plants can be grown from leaf pieces, called leaf cuttings, which produce both stems and roots. The scions used in grafting are also called cuttings.|$|R

25|$|In 2007, Brian Keener and Lawrence J. Davenport {{described}} the fertile Havana Glen {{population as a}} separate species, Asplenium tutwilerae. They argued that as the fertile population is sexually reproducing, reproductively isolated, and emerged from a common origin (in contrast to A.×ebenoides, which arises through independent hybridization events, possibly followed by <b>vegetative</b> <b>propagation),</b> it is consistent with several well-accepted biological species concepts and is deserving of recognition.|$|E
25|$|Coffea arabica is {{predominantly}} self-pollinating, {{and as a}} result the seedlings are generally uniform and vary little from their parents. In contrast, Coffea canephora, and C. liberica are self-incompatible and require outcrossing. This means that useful forms and hybrids must be propagated vegetatively. Cuttings, grafting, and budding are the usual methods of <b>vegetative</b> <b>propagation.</b> On the other hand, there is great scope for experimentation in search of potential new strains.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} area of symbiosis between carnivorous plants and insects is pollination. While {{many species of}} carnivorous plant can reproduce asexually via self-pollination or <b>vegetative</b> <b>propagation,</b> many carnivorous plants are insect-pollinated. Outcross pollination is beneficial as it increases genetic diversity. This means that carnivorous plants undergo an evolutionary and ecological conflict often called the pollinator-prey conflict. There are several ways by which carnivorous plants reduce the strain of the pollinator-prey conflict. For long-lived plants, the short-term loss of reproduction may be offset by the future growth made possible by resources obtained from prey. Other plants might [...] "target" [...] different species of insect for pollination and prey using different olfactory and visual cues.|$|E
40|$|Many shrubs, vines, {{and trees}} {{can be easily}} multiplied using {{various parts of the}} plant, such as stems, leaves, or roots.

Molecular markers, such as allozymes (e.g., del Río, 1999) and inter-simple sequence repeats (e.g., Pissard et al., 2006), show oca diversity {{to be low}} relative to other crops, probably because of its <b>vegetative</b> mode of <b>propagation.</b> While genetic differentiation corresponds well with folk classification, cluster analyses indicate that folk cultivars are not perfect clones, but rather genetically heterogeneous groupings.|$|R
40|$|A recent {{genetic and}} {{physical}} study (Arber et al. 1979) of spontaneous P 1 prophage mutants affected in the <b>vegetative</b> phage <b>propagation</b> revealed {{that at the}} most a few percent of spontaneous mutations were caused by nucleotide substitution or other small altera-tions in the nucleotide sequence. About 70 % of all mu-tations studied were relatively long deletions clustering around the single IS/element carried in the wild-type PI genome.

Studies of alpine and subalpine heath indicate a minimum average fire-free period greater than 250 years, and it is unlikely that many seeds will persist this long. It appears that plants of O. revolutus maintain themselves predominantly through <b>vegetative</b> <b>propagation</b> during the long disturbance free periods, and the great majority of young plants are the result of underground stems. It is therefore possible that the high levels of parasitism witnessed in the seed pods of O. revolutus represent a negligible impact on recruitment.

2500|$|Within the Eurasian clade, the two subclades {{differ in}} bulb type. In subclade B2 (Fritillaria, Rhinopetalum, and Japonica), the bulb type is {{described}} as Fritillaria-type, with 2–3 fleshy scales and the tunica derived from the remnants of previous year's scales. by contrast subclade B2 (Petilium, Theresia and Korolkowia) differ. Those of Theresia and Korolkowia are large, consisting of a single large fleshy scale, while Petilium species have several large erect imbricate scales. In Liliorhiza the bulbs are naked and have nunerous scales similar to Lilium, but with numerous [...] "rice-grain bulbils". The location of thee bulbils differ from the more common aerial pattern of arising from within the axil of a leaf or inflorecence, as in Lilium and Allium. Similar bulbils are also found in Davidii. These bulbils arise in the axils of the scale leaves. Bulbils confer an evolutionary advantage in <b>vegetative</b> <b>propagation.</b>|$|E
60|$|Again, {{propagation}} is of one mode in {{the higher}} animals, of two in all plants; but <b>vegetative</b> <b>propagation,</b> by budding or offshoots, extends through the lower grades of animals. In both kingdoms there may be separation of the offshoots, or indifference in this respect, or continued and organic union with the parent stock; and this either with essential independence of the offshoots, or with a subordination of these to a common whole; or finally with such subordination and amalgamation, along with specialization of function, that the same parts, which in other cases can be regarded only as progeny, in these become only members of an individual.|$|E
40|$|While {{tissue culture}} (TC) {{technology}} for <b>vegetative</b> plant <b>propagation</b> is gradually gaining in importance in Africa, rigorous ex post assessments of welfare effects for smallholder farm households is lacking. Using recent survey data and accounting for self-selection in technology adoption, we analyze {{the impacts of}} TC banana technology on household income and food security in Kenya. To assess food security outcomes, we employ the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) – a tool {{that has not been}} used for impact assessment before. Estimates of treatment-effects models show that TC banana adoption increases farm and household income by 153 % and 50 %, respectively. The technology also reduces relative food insecurity in a significant way. These results indicate that TC technology can be welfare enhancing for adopting farm households; its use should be further promoted through upscaling appropriate technology delivery systems.

50|$|Because the {{variegation}} {{is due to}} {{the presence}} of two kinds of plant tissue, propagating the plant must be by a <b>vegetative</b> method of <b>propagation</b> that preserves both types of tissue in relation to each other. Typically, stem cuttings, bud and stem grafting, and other propagation methods that results in growth from leaf axil buds will preserve variegation. Cuttings with complete variegation may be difficult if not impossible to propagate. Root cuttings will not usually preserve variegation, since the new stem tissue is derived from a particular tissue type within the root.|$|R

40|$|Plant hormones, and {{especially}} auxins, are {{low molecular weight}} compounds highly involved in the control of plant growth and development. Auxins are also broadly used in horticulture, as part of <b>vegetative</b> plant <b>propagation</b> protocols, allowing the cloning of genotypes of interest. Over the years large efforts {{have been put in}} the development of more sensitive and precise methods of analysis and quantification of plant hormone levels in plant tissues.

In this review, the current methods of auxin analysis are discussed. Sample preparation procedures, including extraction, purification and derivatization, are reviewed and compared. The different analytical techniques, ranging from chromatographic and mass spectrometry methods to immunoassays and electrokinetic methods, as well as other types of detection are also discussed. Considering that auxin analysis mirrors the evolution in analytical chemistry, the number of publications describing new and/or improved methods is always increasing and we considered appropriate to update the available information. For that reason, this article aims to review the current advances in auxin analysis, and thus only reports from the past 15 years will be covered...|$|R
40|$|<b>Vegetative</b> shoot-based <b>propagation</b> of plants, {{including}} mass {{propagation of}} elite genotypes, {{is dependent on}} the development of shoot-borne roots, which are also called adventitious roots. Multiple endogenous and environmental factors control the complex process of adventitious rooting. In the past few years, we have shown that the auxin response factors ARF 6 and ARF 8, targets of the microRNA miR 167, are positive regulators of adventitious rooting, whereas ARF 17, a target of miR 160, is a negative regulator. We showed that these genes have overlapping expression profiles during adventitious rooting and that they regulate each other’s expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels by modulating the homeostasis of miR 160 and miR 167. We demonstrate here that this complex network of transcription factors regulates the expression of three auxin-inducible Gretchen Hagen 3 (GH 3) genes, GH 3. 3, GH 3. 5, and GH 3. 6, encoding acyl-acid-amido synthetases. We show that these three GH 3 genes are required for fine-tuning adventitious root initiation in the Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyl, and we demonstrate that they act by modulating jasmonic acid homeostasis. We propose a model in which adventitious rooting is an adaptive developmental response involving crosstalk between the auxin and jasmonate regulatory pathways...|$|R

40|$|Many of {{the goals}} of the {{university}} teacher today are to enthuse, drive and challenge students academically, intellectually and personally; to advance their capacity for critical thinking, judgement and communication; and to equip them with sufficient scientific and technical knowledge to make them competent horticultural practitioners. Given that most programme modules are delivered by lectures, there is general consensus that student learning is primarily passive. Similarly, module assessment tends to be summative. Thus, student-centred learning to foster an environment for active learning and encourage greater student class participation was introduced into a horticulture module (Nursery Production and Management HORT 40090). Similarly, formative assessment methods were also introduced. To this end, a segment of the above module relating to <b>vegetative</b> plant <b>propagation</b> was selected. The students were asked to work in self selected groups to thoroughly research the different aspects of the topic and to prepare a short PowerPoint slide presentation for delivery to the class. Additionally, they were required to peer assess each presentation and to agree a suitable grade with staff members in attendance. It is considered that the introduction of active learning and formative assessment to the module resulted in more meaningful learning for the students concerned and moved them higher up the student-centred learning curve towards more, responsibility and accountability.

The rocky coast population relied heavily upon sexual fertilization while the estuarine population relied almost solely upon <b>vegetative</b> fragmentation for <b>propagation,</b> clearly indicating life history plasticity within this species.

Ectomycorrhizas from oaks and hazels from two orchards were mapped and genotyped using {{simple sequence repeat}} markers and the mating type locus. The distribution of the two T. melanosporum mating types was also monitored in the soil. In one orchard, the genetic profiles of the ascocarps were {{compared with those of}} the underlying mycorrhizas. A pronounced spatial genetic structure was found. The maximum genet sizes were 2. 35 and 4. 70 m in the two orchards, with most manifesting a size < 1 m. Few genets persisted throughout two seasons. A nonrandom distribution pattern of the T. melanosporum was observed, resulting in field patches colonized by genets that shared the same mating types. Our findings suggest that competition occurs between genets and provide basic information on T. melanosporum propagation patterns that are relevant for the management of productive truffle orchards...|$|R

40|$|Adventitious roots (AR) are post {{embryonic}} lateral organs that {{differentiate from}} non-root tissues. The {{understanding of the}} molecular mechanism which underlies their differentiation is important because of their central role in <b>vegetative</b> plant <b>propagation.</b> Here it was studied how the expression of different microtubule (MT) -associated proteins (MAPs) is affected during AR induction, and whether expression differences are dependent on MT organization itself. To examine AR formation when MTs are disturbed we used two mutants in the MT severing protein KATANIN. It was found that rate and number of AR primordium formed following IBA induction for three days was reduced in bot 1 - 1 and bot 1 - 7 plants. The reduced capacity to form ARs in bot 1 - 1 was associated with altered expression of MAP-encoding genes along AR induction. While the expression of MAP 65 - 4, MAP 65 - 3, AURORA 1, AURORA 2 and TANGLED, increased in wild-type but not in bot 1 - 1 plants, the expression of MAP 65 - 8 and MDP 25 decreased in wild type plants {{but not in the}} bot 1 - 1 plant after two days of IBA-treatment. The expression of MOR 1 was increased two days after AR induction in wild type and bot 1 - 1 plants. To examine its expression specifically in AR primordium, MOR 1 upstream regulatory sequence was isolated and cloned to regulate GFP. Expression of GFP was induced in the primary root tips and lateral roots, in the pericycle of the hypocotyls and in all stages of AR primordium formation. It is concluded that the expression of MAPs is regulated along AR induction and that reduction in KATANIN expression inhibits AR formation and indirectly influences the specific expression of some MAPs...|$|R
40|$|In plants, {{undifferentiated}} or totally differentiated {{cells can}} be easily in vitro cultured to generate undifferentiated embryogenic cells that can regenerate complete plants. This is the most spectacular expression of totipotency. Embryogenic cells represent a key material in plant biotechnologies as they are used in many processes aiming at asexual reproduction by somatic embryogenesis (SE), genetic transformation, protoplast regeneration and cryopreservation. Nevertheless, tissue culture systems that involve the acquisition of competence for totipotency and extensive cell division remain risky with respect to genome and epigenome instabilities. Particularly, the use of embryogenic cell suspensions has frequently been {{associated with an increased}} likelihood of genetic instability and somaclonal variation (SV) in the regenerated plants. SV is a major concern in all in vitro <b>vegetative</b> plant <b>propagation</b> systems because it leads to the loss of genetic fidelity. Since 20 years, embryogenic cell suspension based SE techniques have been applied to coffee for the large-scale dissemination of exceptional Arabica hybrids. Here, we present our production and research experience showing that SE is efficient and reliable for true-to-type propagation. Over 99 % of coffee trees regenerated fully conform to the mother plant, both morphologically - they grow, flower and produce normally. Hence strong genetic and epigenetic changes in proliferating embryogenic cells are not a fatality. The results also demonstrated the importance of embryogenic culture age on SV and hence the non-random nature of this phenomenon. The genetic and epigenetic alterations are particularly limited during SE. The main change in most of phenotypic variants was aneuploidy showing that mitotic aberrations {{play a major role in}} SV in coffee. These results provide a proof of concept for the use of embryogenic cell suspensions with other plant species: a revolution in the world of plant micropropagation on an industrial scale.

Softwood cuttings of C. acuminata rooted readily in intermittent mist (4 sec on every 6 min.) in coarse vermiculite when treated with K-IBA (indolebutyric acid, potassium salt) quick dips ranging from 4. 14 mM to 37. 3 mM, with a 29. 0 mM quick dip (5 sec.) promoting 82 % rooting with little foliar damage.
