Its minor curves and angles were all subjected to one strong ruling tendency and law of advance, dependent partly on the aim of every shoot to raise itself upright, partly on the necessity which each was under to yield due place to the neighboring leaves, and obtain for itself as much light and air as possible. It had indeed been ascertained that <b>vegetable</b> <b>tissue</b> was liable to contractions and expansion (under fixed mechanical conditions) by light, heat, moisture, etc. But <b>vegetable</b> <b>tissue</b> in the living branch did not contract nor expand under external influence alone. The principle of life manifested itself either by contention with, or felicitous recognition of, external force. It accepted with a visible, active, and apparently joyful concurrence, the influences which led the bough towards its due place in the economy of the tree; and it obeyed reluctantly, partially, and with distorted curvatures, those which forced it to violate the typical organic form. The attention of painters of foliage had seldom been drawn with sufficient accuracy to the lines either of branch curvature, or leaf contour, as expressing these subtle laws of incipient volition; but the relative merit of the great schools of figure design might, in absence of all other evidence, be determined, almost without error, by observing the precision of their treatment of leaf curvature. The leaf-painting round the head of Ariosto by Titian, in the National Gallery, might be instanced.|$|E

And {{we see in}} this, therefore, {{that the}} {{instinct}} which leads us thus to attribute life to the lowest forms of organic nature, does not necessarily spring from faithlessness, nor the deducing a moral out of them from an irregular and languid conscientiousness. In this, as in almost all things connected with moral discipline, the same results may follow from contrary causes; and as there are a good and evil contentment, a good and evil discontent, a good and evil care, fear, ambition, and so on, there are also good and evil forms of this sympathy with nature, and disposition to moralize over it.[96] In general, active men, of strong sense and stern principle, do not care to see anything in a leaf, but <b>vegetable</b> <b>tissue,</b> and are so well convinced of useful moral truth, {{that it does not}} strike them as a new or notable thing when they find it in any way symbolized by material nature; hence there is a strong presumption, when first we perceive a tendency in any one to regard trees as living, and enunciate moral aphorisms over every pebble they stumble against, that such tendency proceeds from a morbid temperament, like Shelley's, or an inconsistent one, like Jaques's. But when the active life is nobly fulfilled, and the mind is then raised beyond it into clear and calm beholding of the world around us, the same tendency again manifests itself in the most sacred way: the simplest forms of nature are strangely animated by the sense of the Divine presence; the trees and flowers seem all, in a sort, children of God; and we ourselves, their fellows, made out of the same dust, and greater than they only in having a greater portion of the Divine power exerted on our frame, and all the common uses and palpably visible forms of things, become subordinate in our minds to their inner glory,--to the mysterious voices in which they talk to us about God, and the changeful and typical aspects by which they witness to us of holy truth, and fill us with obedient, joyful, and thankful emotion.|$|E

Results showed that ohmic heating rate increased with increasing the temperature and the electric field strength applied, {{as a direct result of}} the increase of electrical conductivity. Moreover, it was also noted the existence of a transition temperature above which a sharp transition of the electrical conductivity curve was observed. The higher the field strength, the lower the transition temperature. Whatever the thermal treatment, as the final temperature increased, the damage of cell membrane of <b>vegetable</b> <b>tissue</b> also increased leading to a reduction in impedance.

The modified bottom platen and its heating system provided rapid heat transfer and reproducible heating rates. Small discs of tissue (1 - 9 mm, 20 - 6 mm dia) were attached to the platen and rheological parameters were measured at 30 °C. Some tissues gave measurements that were within the linear viscoelastic region; others demonstrated nonlinear behaviour. The applied stress was in phase with the strain, and shear modulus (G′) was therefore the important rheological parameter. When discs of <b>vegetable</b> <b>tissue</b> were heated in the range 20 - 80 °C the G′ value rose slightly then declined rapidly.

This study focussed upon the effects of heat on the material properties of model vegetable tissues (Chinese water chestnut and carrot), with particular emphasis on the rate of compression during mechanical testing. In a homogeneous system such as cooked Chinese water chestnut, low strain rate compression (0. 2 min(- 1)) produced buckling of the cell walls, steady fluid expression, low stiffness and fractures at high strains. However a high compressive strain rate (> 50 min(- 1)), produced a high stiffness and failure by a rapid, brittle fracture at low strain, which propagated by cell rupture causing limited, rapid fluid release. These differences in mechanical behaviour are ascribed {{to the ability of}} cellular fluid to flow through the tissue during the timescale of the compressive test. When carrot tissue was heated for short periods of time (20 min at 100 degreesC), weakening of the inter-cellular adhesion changed the failure mechanism from cell rupture to cell separation.

40|$|The {{consumption}} of locally-produced vegetables by humans {{may be an}} important exposure pathway for soil contaminants in many urban settings and for agricultural land use. Hence, prediction of metal and metalloid uptake by vegetables from contaminated soils {{is an important part of}} the Human Health Risk Assessment procedure. The behaviour of metals (cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, lead and zinc) and metalloids (arsenic, boron and selenium) in contaminated soils depends to a large extent on the intrinsic charge, valence and speciation of the contaminant ion, and soil properties such as pH, redox status and contents of clay and/or organic matter. However, chemistry and behaviour of the contaminant in soil alone cannot predict soil-to-plant transfer.

40|$|This book {{focuses on}} two {{specific}} areas related to fractional order systems – {{the realization of}} physical devices characterized by non-integer order impedance, usually called fractional-order elements (FOEs); and the characterization of <b>vegetable</b> <b>tissues</b> via electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) – and provides readers with new tools for designing new types of integrated circuits. The majority of the book addresses FOEs. The interest in these topics {{is related to the}} need to produce “analogue” electronic devices characterized by non-integer order impedance, and to the characterization of natural phenomena, which are systems with memory or aftereffects and for which the fractional-order calculus tool is the ideal choice for analysis. FOEs represent the building blocks for designing and realizing analogue integrated electronic circuits, which the authors believe hold the potential for a wealth of mass-market applications. The freedom to choose either an integer- or non-integer-order analogue integrator/derivator is a new one for electronic circuit designers. The book shows how specific non-integer-order impedance elements can be created using materials with specific structural properties. EIS measures the electrical impedance of a specimen across a given range of frequencies, producing a spectrum that represents the variation of the impedance versus frequency – a technique that has the advantage of avoiding aggressive examinations.
