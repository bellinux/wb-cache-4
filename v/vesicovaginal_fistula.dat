500|$|At {{a meeting}} of the American Gynecological Society in 1920, DeLee sparked {{controversy}} when he presented a paper advocating for the use of a systematic approach to childbirth for physicians, including the use of forceps and episiotomy even in women who had no labor complications. DeLee's [...] "prophylactic forceps operation" [...] consisted of several steps: scopolamine injections in the first stage of labor, ether anesthesia in the next stage, then episiotomy and forceps delivery. Ergot was used in the subsequent manual extraction of the placenta. DeLee reasoned that the episiotomy prevented perineal tears which could cause complications like uterine prolapse and <b>vesicovaginal</b> <b>fistula.</b> He said that the early use of forceps would avoid pressure from the pelvic bones against a baby's head, thus preventing complications like epilepsy and cerebral palsy; DeLee said that fatal complications occurred in 4–5% of labors managed with the traditional conservative approach. Though DeLee said that such interventions should only be carried out by a well-equipped physician specialist, John Whitridge Williams and other prominent obstetricians criticized DeLee sharply. They felt that DeLee was being too aggressive by removing a baby before complications occurred; DeLee's colleagues preferred to be conservative and to manage complications as they arose.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} results of Martius&#x 2032; labial fat pad {{interposition}} and its modification using skin island in the repair of giant and recurrent <b>vesicovaginal</b> and urethrovaginal <b>fistulae.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients of urethrovaginal and <b>vesicovaginal</b> <b>fistulae</b> underwent Martius&#x 2032; labial fat pad interposition and its skin island modification during 1996 to 1999. Ten of these were recurrent (66 &#x 0025;) and five were giant fistulae (34 &#x 0025;) i. e. more than five cms. RESULTS: Results were very gratifying with a successful repair in 14 patients (93 &#x 0025;). Two patients had transient, low-grade stress incontinence, which did not need any additional procedure. In one patient, there was failure of repair, which was later successfully repaired using fat pad from opposite labia. CONCLUSION: Martius&#x 2032; fat pad interposition provides vascularity and surface for epithelialisation and also prevents overlapping of vesical/urethral and vaginal suture lines.

Aim. Genitourinary fistulas are bothersome clinical entities {{not only for the}} patient but also for the treating surgeon as well. A lot of surgical procedures have been proposed; however, most of the fistulas can be easily treated with plain surgical techniques, such as the simple surgical closure of the fistula tract. Material and Method. The study was carried out in the urogynecology department of Ankara Etlik Zübeyde HanımMaternity Training and Research Hospital. The study included 12 cases with <b>vesicovaginal</b> <b>fistulas</b> and 15 cases with rectovaginal fistulas. Twenty-six patients underwent simple surgical closure technique. The age, the referral time to the hospital, the longest diameter of the fistula opening, the hospitalization time, the follow-up period and identifiable risk factors of the patients were evaluated. Results. Caeserean section was detected as primary risk factor for <b>vesicovaginal</b> <b>fistulas</b> and prolonged labor was detected as the most important risk factor for rectovaginal fistulas. In our study, we found that the simple closure technique cured 91 % of <b>vesicovaginal</b> <b>fistulas</b> and 93 % of rectovaginal fistulas. Conclusion. The simple closure technique has very high cure rates for both <b>vesicovaginal</b> and rectovaginal <b>fistulas</b> when the longest diameter of the fistula openings is ≤ 5 mm. 1...|$|R

50|$|A tampon {{is placed}} into the vagina. If the tampon turns blue, <b>vesicovaginal</b> <b>fistula</b> is suspected. If the tampon turns orange, ureterovaginal fistula is suspected. If the tampon turns blue and orange, suspect a {{combination}} of vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulae. It {{is important to be}} alert for leakage around the catheter, which may spill back into the vagina creating the false impression of a fistula. It is also important to ensure that adequate distension of the bladder occurs as some fistulae do not leak at small volumes; conversely, some fistulae with an oblique track through the bladder wall may leak at small volumes, but not at capacity. Direct inspection of leaking dye in vagina in lithotomy position is better than the traditional 'three swab test' as multiple fistulae may be located in this way.|$|E
