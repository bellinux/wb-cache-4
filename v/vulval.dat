25|$|In some animals, in {{addition}} to expelling waste material, urination can mark territory or express submissiveness. Physiologically, urination involves coordination between the central, autonomic, and somatic nervous systems. Brain centers that regulate urination include the pontine micturition center, periaqueductal gray, and the cerebral cortex. In placental mammals, urine is drained through the urinary meatus, a urethral opening in the male penis or female <b>vulval</b> vestibule.|$|E
25|$|Although some {{papillomavirus}} types {{can cause}} {{cancer in the}} epithelial tissues they inhabit, cancer is not a typical outcome of infection. The development of papillomavirus-induced cancers typically occurs {{over the course of}} many years. Papillomaviruses have been associated with the development of cervical cancer, penile cancer and oral cancers. An association with <b>vulval</b> cancer and urothelial carcinoma with squamous differentiation in patients with neurogenic bladder has also been noted.|$|E
500|$|The gestational {{period is}} around 440 to 450 days long, {{following}} which usually a single calf is born, weighing [...] The udder of the pregnant female starts swelling {{two months before}} parturition, and <b>vulval</b> discharges may occur. Parturition takes 3–4 hours, and the female stands throughout this period, though she may rest during brief intervals. The mother consumes the afterbirth and extensively grooms the infant. Her milk is very rich in proteins and low in fat.|$|E
500|$|Hippopotamuses have {{barrel-shaped}} {{bodies with}} short legs and long muzzles. Their skeletal structures are , adapted to carrying their enormous weight, and their specific gravity {{allows them to}} sink and move {{along the bottom of}} a river. Hippopotamuses have small legs (relative to other megafauna) because the water in which they live reduces the weight burden. Though they are bulky animals, hippopotamuses can gallop at [...] on land but normally trot. They are incapable of jumping but do climb up steep banks. Despite being semiaquatic and having webbed feet, an adult hippo is not a particularly good swimmer nor can it float. It is rarely found in deep water; when it is, the animal moves by porpoise-like leaps from the bottom. The eyes, ears, and nostrils of hippos are placed high on the roof of their skulls. This allows these organs to remain above the surface {{while the rest of the}} body submerges. The testes of the males descend only partially and a scrotum is not present. In addition, the penis retracts into the body when not erect. The genitals of the female are unusual in that the vagina is ridged and two large diverticula protrude from the <b>vulval</b> vestibule. The function of these is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|Images of vulvae {{are absent}} from the popular media and {{advertising}} and don't appear in some anatomy textbooks, while community opposition to sex education limits the access that young women have to information about natural variation in labias. Many women have limited knowledge of <b>vulval</b> anatomy, and are unable to say what a [...] "normal" [...] vulva looks like.|$|E
2500|$|Discussions {{of female}} orgasm are {{complicated}} by orgasms in women typically being {{divided into two}} categories: clitoral orgasm and vaginal (or G-spot) orgasm. In 1973, Irving Singer theorized {{that there are three}} types of female orgasms; he categorized these as <b>vulval,</b> uterine, and blended, but because he was a philosopher, [...] "these categories were generated from descriptions of orgasm in literature rather than laboratory studies". In 1982, Ladas, Whipple and Perry also proposed three categories: the tenting type (derived from clitoral stimulation), the A-frame type (derived from G-spot stimulation), and the blended type (derived from clitoral and G-spot stimulation). In 1999, Whipple and Komisaruk proposed cervix stimulation as being able to cause a fourth type of female orgasm.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} of vaginal thrush include <b>vulval</b> itching, <b>vulval</b> soreness and irritation, pain or discomfort during sexual intercourse (superficial dyspareunia), pain or discomfort during urination (dysuria) and vaginal discharge, {{which is usually}} odourless. This can be thin and watery, or thick and white, like cottage cheese.|$|E
50|$|DR12 is {{associated}} with <b>vulval</b> lichen sclerosus, and undifferentiated spondyloarthritis.|$|E
50|$|The inner lips {{extend from}} the {{clitoris}} obliquely downward, laterally, and backward {{on either side}} of the <b>vulval</b> vestibule, ending between the bottom of the <b>vulval</b> vestibule and the outer lips. The posterior ends (bottom) of the inner lips are usually joined across the middle line by a fold of skin, named the frenulum of labia minora or fourchette.|$|E
50|$|Other {{features}} include: the pudendal cleft, sebaceous glands, the <b>vulval</b> vestibule, and the urogenital triangle (anterior {{part of the}} perineum).|$|E
50|$|Many {{malignancies}} {{can develop}} in vulvar structures. Most vulvar cancers are squamous cell carcinomas {{and are usually}} found in the labia particularly the labia majora. The second most common <b>vulval</b> cancer (though not very common) is <b>vulval</b> melanoma. A vulvectomy {{may need to be}} performed in order to remove {{some or all of the}} vulva. This procedure is usually performed as a last resort in certain cases of cancer, vulvar dysplasia or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.|$|E
50|$|HIV/AIDS can be {{contracted}} {{through the}} vagina during vaginal intercourse, {{but it is}} not associated with any local vaginal or <b>vulval</b> disease.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the whole}} area of the <b>vulval</b> vestibule, the mucus {{secreted}} by those glands protects the labia from dryness and mechanical irritation.|$|E
50|$|The vulva (wrapper, covering, plural vulvae or vulvas) {{consists}} of the external female sex organs. The vulva includes the mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, bulb of vestibule, <b>vulval</b> vestibule, urinary meatus, greater and lesser vestibular glands, and the vaginal opening. The urinary meatus is also included as it opens into the <b>vulval</b> vestibule. Other features of the vulva include: the pudendal cleft, sebaceous glands, the urogenital triangle (anterior part of the perineum), and pubic hair.|$|E
5000|$|... 1. The male partner first {{stimulates the}} labia minora {{of the female}} partner by tapping and also rubbing with his penis and then, at {{a certain level of}} arousal, {{proceeds}} to stimulate the internal surfaces of the labia minora and the <b>vulval</b> vestibule, including the urinary meatus in the same manner, followed by stimulation of the clitoris, <b>vulval</b> vestibule, labia minora and the vaginal opening. Removal of the female partner's pubic hair is advised for more comfortable manipulation of the penis.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} how information about epistatic interactions relates to gene pathways, let us consider a simple example of <b>vulval</b> cell differentiation in C. elegans. Cells differentiate from Pn cells to Pn.p cells to VP cells to <b>vulval</b> cells. Mutation of lin-26 blocks differentiation of Pn cells to Pn.p cells. Mutants of lin-36 behave similarly, blocking differentiation at the transition to VP cells. In both cases, the resulting phenotype is marked by an absence of <b>vulval</b> cells as there is an upstream block in the differentiation pathway. A double mutant in which both of these genes have been disrupted exhibits an equivalent phenotype that is no worse than either single mutant. The upstream disruption at lin-26 masks the phenotypic effect of a mutation at lin-36 [...] in {{a classic example of}} an alleviating epistatic interaction.|$|E
50|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} can include: itching, or bleeding; skin changes including rashes, sores, lumps or ulcers, {{and changes in}} <b>vulval</b> skin coloration. Pelvic pain might also occur.|$|E
50|$|B. xylophilus is {{distinguished}} by three characteristics: the spicule is flattened into a disc-shaped cucullus at the tip, the front <b>vulval</b> lip is flap-like, and {{the tail of}} the female is rounded.|$|E
50|$|A rectovestibular fistula, also {{referred}} to simply as a vestibular fistula, is an anorectal congenital disorder where an abnormal connection (fistula) exists between the rectum and the <b>vulval</b> vestibule of the female genitalia.|$|E
5000|$|On <b>vulval</b> inspection: a tense, bulging, bluish {{membrane}} is seen, {{this finding}} {{varies according to}} {{the thickness of the}} obstructing membrane. It may be absent in patients with complete or partial vaginal agenesis.|$|E
50|$|The {{area between}} the labia minora where the vaginal opening and urinary meatus are located is called the <b>vulval</b> vestibule. The urinary meatus is below the {{clitoris}} and {{just in front of}} the vagina.|$|E
50|$|The {{likelihood}} of {{inflammation may be}} reduced through appropriate regular hygienic cleansing of the whole <b>vulval</b> vestibule, using water and medically tested cleansing agents designed for female intimate areas. To avoid contamination of the vulva with fecal bacteria, {{it is recommended that}} the vulva is washed only from front to back, from mons pubis to the perineum and anus. Apart from water and special liquid cleansing agents (lotions), there are commercially available wet wipes for female intimate hygiene. Some women wipe the <b>vulval</b> vestibule dry with toilet tissue after urination to avoid irritation and infections from residual drops of the urine in the area.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of vulvar cancer include itching, a lump or sore on the vulva {{which does}} not heal and/or grows larger, and {{sometimes}} discomfort/pain/swelling in the <b>vulval</b> area. Treatments include vulvectomy - removal of {{all or part of}} the vulva.|$|E
50|$|In female {{individuals}} as well, various anatomical parts can {{be suitable for}} piercings. These include the mons pubis, the clitoris (including the clitoral hood), the (inner and outer) labia and the <b>vulval</b> vestibule (which is the area surrounding the vaginal opening).|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Once {{he recognizes}} a {{hermaphrodite}} worm, the male nematode begins tracing the hermaphrodite with his tail until {{he reaches the}} <b>vulval</b> region. The male then probes the region with his spicules to locate the vulva, inserts them, and releases sperm.|$|E
50|$|George Drummond Robinson {{published}} {{widely in}} the field of Obstetrics, and his publications included Some Micro-Organisms of Obstetrical and Gyaecological Interest, 1895, Progress of Gyaecology and Midwifery during the Queen's Reign, 1897, <b>Vulval</b> Discharges in Children, 1899, and An Atlas of Normal Labour, 1925.|$|E
50|$|To {{the left}} and right of the <b>vulval</b> {{vestibule}} are the labia minora. In front of it are the clitoral hood, frenulum clitoridis, and the clitoral glans. Posterior to it is the posterior commissure of the labia minora and the frenulum of labia minora.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vulval</b> {{vestibule}} (or vulvar vestibule) {{is a part}} of the vulva {{between the}} labia minora into which the urinary meatus (urethral opening) and the vaginal opening open. Its edge is marked by Hart's line. It represents lower end of urogenital sinus from stage of embryo.|$|E
5000|$|Complete - {{in which}} the two ureters drain separately. Complete {{ureteral}} duplication may result in one ureter opening normally into the bladder, and the other being ectopic, ending in the vagina, the urethra or the <b>vulval</b> vestibule. These cases occur when the ureteric bud arises twice (rather than splitting).|$|E
50|$|Parasitic {{infection}}s include trichomoniasis, pediculosis pubis and scabies. Trichomoniasis is a microparasitic infection {{caused by}} the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. This {{is the most common}} <b>vulval</b> infection (in industrialised societies) and is transmitted by sexual contact. Pediculosis pubis commonly called crabs, is a disease {{caused by the}} ectoparasite crab louse (Pthiras pubis).|$|E
5000|$|Female: The vulva is a {{transverse}} slit and the <b>vulval</b> lips do not protrude {{into the}} vagina which generally has an opposing pair of sclerotized {{pieces in the}} lateral view. There are two ovaries which are amphidelphic and outstretched. There is also a spermatheca present. (CIH: Set 3 No. 40.1974) ...|$|E
5000|$|The Caenorhabditis elegans sel-12 gene encodes a multi-pass {{transmembrane domain}} protein {{that is similar}} to human presenilin. [...] sel-12 {{positively}} regulates the lin-12 and glp-1 Notch signaling pathways during hermaphrodite gonadal, <b>vulval,</b> and germline development. sel-12 also plays a role in thermotaxis (the nematode worm prefers a certain temperature and moves accordingly).|$|E
50|$|Egg {{cases of}} this genus contain yellow(ish) eggs {{and have more}} than one hundred {{individual}} eggs in them. They are coated in a thin layer of coagulated <b>vulval</b> secretion and some fine silken threads. This structure rests on a mesh of fine threads above the bottom of the inner chamber of the egg case.|$|E
50|$|Tripylella muscusi is {{a species}} of nematode, first found in Mexico. It can be {{distinguished}} by its body length (averaging 0.94 mm); its pharynx and tail lengths; its possession of an excretory pore; exhibiting body pores and scant somatic setae; a striated cuticle carrying sparse anastomoses; as well as protruding <b>vulval</b> lips, among other characteristics.|$|E
50|$|During menopause, {{hormone levels}} decrease, and as this process happens, {{reproductive}} tissues which {{are sensitive to}} these hormones shrink in size.The mons pubis, labia, and clitoris are reduced in size in post-menopause, although not usually to pre-puberty proportions.This is a condition called <b>vulval</b> atrophy and the decrease in estrogen can cause pale, itchy or sore skin.|$|E
50|$|This {{species has}} a {{relatively}} large body size, with eggs reaching 0.040-0.049 × 0.021-0.026 mm. The structure of the male caudal extremity presents two wide, lobe-like, dorso-lateral caudal projections. It has a large spicule (0.236-0.374 mm) and a transversely wrinkled and non-spiny spicular sheath.Its stichosome has 30-40 stichocytes {{and it has a}} slightly elevated anterior <b>vulval</b> lip.|$|E
