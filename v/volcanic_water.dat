To investigate the weathering processes, turnover time of groundwater, and its origin, wecollected and analyzed water samples from the large-scale landslide area, the Matsukoshi land-slide area and the Ohmata river basin. The following facts can be pointed out: (1) water-rock interaction is very active near the valley head of the large-scale landslide area, (2) bi-carbonate concentration increases with lowering of elevation in the Ohmata river basin, (3) waters from the landslide areas are in equilibrium with kaolinite and montmorillonite, (4) two kinds of water are found near the large-scale landslide area; one is old water rich insodium and bicarbonate and the other is recently recharged water rich in calcium andbicarbonate, and (5) there is no detectable contribution of <b>volcanic</b> <b>water</b> to the naturalwaters around Mt.

Their method {{is based on}} imaging volcanic gas and aerosol plumes using a camera sensitive to the near-infrared (NIR) absorption of water vapor. The imaging data are empirically calibrated by comparison with in situ water measurements made within the plumes. Though the presented method may give reasonable results over short time scales, the authors fail to recognize {{the sensitivity of the}} technique to light scattering on aerosols within the plume. In fact, the signals measured by Pering et al. are not related to the absorption of NIR radiation by water vapor within the plume. Instead, the measured signals are most likely caused by a change in the effective light path of the detected radiation through the atmospheric background water vapor column. Therefore, their method is actually based on establishing an empirical relationship between in-plume scattering efficiency and plume water content. Since this relationship is sensitive to plume aerosol abundance and numerous environmental factors, the method will only yield accurate results if it is calibrated very frequently using other measurement techniques...|$|E

Geochemical and isotopic modeling were used in this study to define the relationship of the volcanic tuff aquifers and aquitards to the underlying regional carbonate ground-water system. The chemical evolution of a ground water as it passes through a hypothetical tuffaceous aquifer was developed using computer models PHREEQE, WATEQDR and BALANCE. The tuffaceous system was divided into five parts, with specific mineralogies, reaction steps and temperatures. The initial solution was an analysis of a soil water from Rainier Mesa. The ending solution in each part became the initial solution in the next part. Minerals consisted of zeolites, smectites, authigenic feldspars and quartz polymorphs from described diagentic mineral zones. Reaction steps were ion exchange with zeolites. The solution from the final zone, Part V, was chosen as most representative, in terms of pH, element molalities and mineral solubilities, of tuffaceous water. This hypothetical <b>volcanic</b> <b>water</b> from Part V was mixed with water from the regional carbonate aquifer, and the results compared to analyses of Yucca Mountain wells.

40|$|International audienceVolcanoes {{can store}} and drain {{water that is}} used as a {{valuable}} resource by populations living on their slopes. The water drainage and storage pattern depend on the volcano lithologies and structure, as well as the geological and hydrometric settings. The drainage and storage pattern will change according to the hydrometric conditions, the vegetation cover, the eruptive activity and the long- and short-term volcano deformation. Inspired by our field observations and based on geology and structure of volcanic edifices, on hydrogeological studies, and modelling of water flow in opening fractures, we develop a model of water storage and drainage linked with volcano evolution. This paper offers a first-order general model of water evolution in volcanoes. The volcano’s water {{plays an important role in}} volcano stability and instability. Nevertheless, the migration and storage of <b>volcanic</b> <b>water</b> prior and during landslide have not been extensively studied in regard to volcano evolution. We further explore this role and its impact on debris avalanche emplacement behaviour. Isolated water-saturated domains will favour ductile deformation, and unequal distribution of water within the debris avalanche partly explains the coeval occurrence of brittle and ductile deformation, indicating complex rheologies, and varied emplacement mechanisms. If the volcano prior to landslide is storing large amounts of water, this water will quickly flow in the landslide and will form a basal slurry upon which the avalanche will spread further...|$|E
40|$|Eruption {{of liquid}} H 2 O magmas along extensional {{fractures}} and graben-bounding normal faults {{may have played}} a critical role in the development of Ganymede's grooved terrain. The resurfacing potential of a water magma is dependent on a variety of factors, including the areal extent of the source region, the rate of discharge, the thickness of the flow, and the time that it takes the flow to completely freeze to its base. In this paper the thermal evolution of such a flow is considered in detail. The minimum unfrozen lifetime of a 5 -m flow is approximately 12. 5 days while a 10 -m flow would survive for at least 50 days. Heating resulting from frictional head loss could reasonably extend these lifetimes by 50 percent or more. With a discharge rate of the order of 1 - 10 cu km/d, an individual <b>volcanic</b> <b>water</b> flow could flood an area of about 10, 000 sq km before freezing. As the flow solidifies, its volume will increase, thus lifting and arching its protective ice cover. Extensional fractures may then develop in the ice subparallel to the graben walls. These fractures could result in grooves directly, given a sufficiently thick (1 km) flow, or they may simply act to concentrate various tectonic forces that could initiate groove-producing faults...|$|E

30|$|It is {{also noted}} that the amount of fluid {{generated}} from the slab is maximum at depths of 30 to 80  km and is greatly reduced deeper than 100  km in most subduction zones (Iwamori 1998). Instead, beneath the northeastern Japan arc, the subducted serpentinite along the slab undergoes dehydration and supplies fluids upward beneath the arc volcanic zones, causing melting in a high-temperature region of {{the central part of the}} mantle wedge (Iwamori 1998). Then, hydrous magma is fed to a shallow chamber, where degassing may create <b>volcanic</b> <b>waters</b> and gases.

In this context, andesitic water and the Arima-type brine as suggested in this study are believed to reflect different origins, although their δ 18 O-δD ranges overlap.|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{geochemistry}} of the stable isotopes of chlorine will be examined. Chlorine {{is one of}} the halogens, the seventh group in the periodic system of elements. This group consists of five elements, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine. This thesis presents the first chlorine isotope measurements on carbonatites. Significant variations in δ³⁷Cl were observed, but since the samples came from different geological settings it is difficult to interpret the results in terms of fractionating processes. A correlation between chlorine, oxygen and carbon isotopes is suggested. If fractionation of chlorine isotopes is caused by the same processes as the fractionation of oxygen and carbon isotopes, then exchange with the country-rocks or Reyleigh fractionation may be important. The data suggest that δ³⁷Cl in primary carbonatites can be between - 1 and 0 ‰. If these data represent mantle values, which is not proven, this is in agreement with data of <b>volcanic</b> <b>water</b> samples from Indonesia which indicate that chloride escaped from the mantle is enriched in ³⁷Cl, resulting in negative δ³⁷Cl values in the mantle. The results invite more research. It is clear that further research must be combined with an effort to understand the chloride geochemistry of carbonatites, since almost nothing is known on this subject. It is also important to obtain good fractionation knowledge of the HCI degassing system. It will be important to measure both the HN 0 ₃-extractable and the total chloride...|$|E

Geothermal energy potential for 1 km 3 reservoir near the six hot springs in southern and eastern of Sri Lanka can be calculated around 5. 76 MW in Mahapelessa to 34. 86 MW in Marangala.

A novel in-field technique for the preconcentration and separation of four arsenic species was, {{for the first}} time, used {{for the analysis of}} geothermal and <b>volcanic</b> <b>waters.</b> Total arsenic levels along the río Agrio ranged from < 0. 2 - 3783 μg/l As(T). The highest arsenic levels were recorded in the el Vertedero spring (3783 μg/l As(T)) on the flank of the Copahue volcano, which feeds the acidic río Agrio. Arsenite (H(3) AsO(3)) predominated along the upper río Agrio (78. 9 - 81. 2 % iAs(III)) but the species distribution changed at lago Caviahue and arsenate (H(2) AsO(4) (-)) became the main species (51. 4 - 61. 4 % iAs(V)) up until Salto del Agrio. The change in arsenic species is potentially a result of an increase in redox potential and the formation of iron-based precipitates. Arsenic speciation showed a statistically significant correlation with redox potential (r= 0. 9697, P= 0. 01).

Improvements in geochemical techniques enable a better investigation of the Tertiary and Quaternary geothermal reservoir in the Los Azufers field. Traditional stable isotope systems ( 18 O,  2 H), nontraditional stable isotope systems ( 37 Cl,  81 Br), radioactive isotopes (3 H), and radiogenic isotopes (87 Sr/ 86 Sr), were utilized to investigate the groundwater geochemistry and detect the circulation of subsurface geothermal water, and consequently determine spatial anomalies in the geothermal activity. Isotopic data indicate recharging of the geothermal reservoir by meteoric water, where, surface water (meteoric water) infiltrated into the deeper sections of the reservoir’s formations due to the faulted and fractured structure of the volcanic formations in the Los Azufers field. The stable isotope results showed strong water–rock reactions in the study area, especially in the production zone, indicating the presence of former active fluid circulation systems because of the observed changes in temperature and pressure. Moreover, based on the  18 O and  2 H values, the infiltrating meteoric water mixed with andesitic (<b>volcanic)</b> <b>water</b> produced by water–rock interaction processes. The isotope compositions of the hot springs in the study area indicate direct communication between the surface and the reservoir, and also suggest lateral communication between some reinjection and production wells. The Sr concentrations and isotope ratios (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) revealed mixing among waters of different sources, and the extent of water-rock interaction with the different types of igneous rock (rhyolite, basalt, andesite) that formed the reservoirs. The 3 H contents suggest a long residence time of deep waters in the reservoir and fingerprint the recharge of water from the surface to the reservoirs. The chlorine (δ 37 Cl) and bromine (δ 81 Br) isotopes were used to identify the different sources of waters, but because of the faults {{it was hard to see}} correlation in the results. The comparison of the  18 O and  2 H values obtained from the current study with those reported in previous studies suggests that waters are shifting toward andesitic type waters...|$|E
