5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} was {{illustrated}} with paintings by the Swiss artist Samuel Hieronymus Grimm, engraved by W. Angus and aquatinted. Grimm {{had lived in}} England since 1768, and was quite a famous artist, costing 2½ guineas per week. In the event, he stayed in Selborne for 28 days, and White recorded that he worked <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> 24 of them. White also described Grimm's method, which was to sketch the landscape in lead pencil, then {{to put in the}} shading, and finally to add a light wash of watercolour. The illustrations were engraved (signed at lower right) by a variety of engravers including William Angus and Peter Mazell.|$|E
5|$|Mladen {{and other}} members of the Tuzla group were sent to the prison in Zenica. Three months after they were sentenced they were joined by Ilić, whose death penalty had been {{commuted}} to 20 years' imprisonment. In the Zenica prison, each convict had to spend the first three months in solitary confinement. This was <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> Mladen, who became mentally unwell and became so emaciated that Ilić could hardly recognise him. He recovered and took a course in shoe-making which was given in the prison. Afterwards, he fell seriously ill and had to undergo surgery in the prison hospital. In late 1917, the Austrian authorities pardoned all convicts of the Tuzla group except Ilić. Mladen went to his family in Prijedor. After a medical examination, he was declared unfit for army service due to his surgery and as a result was not drafted into the Austrian army. He entered the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, shortly before the disintegration of Austria-Hungary in November 1918.|$|E

Jon Siren of Mankind is Obsolete became the band's new full-time drummer, and Vlixx Vaden of HellTrash was on synth.

25|$|After the Sarajevo assassination, {{more than}} 30 {{citizens}} of Bečkerek were accused by the Austria-Hungary’s authorities of high treason. Among them was Dr. Emil Gavrila, who together with Svetozar Miletić and Jaša Tomić, worked <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> {{the cultural and}} social strengthening of Serbs. The Serbs recruited in the Austria-Hungary’s army began soon to desert, {{so that they would}} not fight against their own people. 7000 of them formed volunteer detachments (people were from Banat and Srem) at the Eastern front and fought at Dobruja, but 79 of them fought on the Salonice front, too.|$|E
25|$|Upon Genie's {{removal from}} this {{location}} in April 1977 she required a two-week stay at Children's Hospital, {{where she was}} able to see her mother and the Riglers, and her condition somewhat improved but she continued mostly using sign language to communicate. That month, Curtiss and Fromkin obtained a year-long grant from the National Science Foundation to continue working with Genie. Authorities then moved to another foster home for several months, an arrangement in which Genie reportedly did fairly well but which unexpectedly ended in late 1977, and after giving her temporary accommodations through the end of December of that year authorities moved her into a different location. In early January 1978 Curtiss wrote these moves were all <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> Genie, causing continued regression in all aspects of her life, and that their frequency heightened their traumatic impact.|$|E

25|$|At Pisa Thomas worked <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> his commission, {{sometimes}} 14 {{hours per}} day. The strain {{was too much}} for his wife, perhaps depressed also by her loss. She ran off with an Englishman, but later returned. The issue of adultery came up again. Violent accusations followed, indignantly repudiated; a diplomatic correspondence ensued, and a demand was made, and supported by the grand duke, for an apology, which the professor refused to make, preferring to lose his chair. He set out once more for Scotland, but was intercepted by the Florentine cardinal Luigi Capponi, who persuaded him to remain at Bologna as professor of Humanity. This was the most distinguished post in the most famous of continental universities, and Dempster was {{at the height of his}} fame. Though his Roman Antiquities and Scotia ilustrior had been placed on the Index pending correction, Pope Urban VIII made him a knight and gave him a pension.|$|E

Fall Out Boy later announced on October 13, 2008, that the early November date was in doubt, citing concerns over the planned election day tie-in. The band was stressed out and worked <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> a tight deadline to get the album out on November 4.

500|$|He {{was exposed}} to {{traditional}} flamenco music as a child while vacationing each summer in his parents' native Andalusia in southern Spain. Originally, Sanz intended to become a flamenco performer, but he found the music teachers to be overly strict. Commenting on his early experiences, Sanz explained, [...] "Flamenco can be <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> beginners. If you lose the rhythm, they toss you out with, 'You're no good, boy!' They're very strict and very cruel. But it's also a marvelous education, because you either learn to play or else." [...] He felt {{that he could not}} compete with his peers, and decided to focus on creating pop music with flamenco influences, viewing flamenco to be a [...] "lifestyle" [...] better suited to others.|$|E

According to Blackman, the staff were <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> Witwer when casting him, but claimed he was far above the other candidates and that [...] "he was already inhabiting the mind of this character". Starkiller's expressions are based on Witwer's, which Blackman described as [...] "a new approach for LucasArts", noting that it [...] "affected the way we handled casting for The Force Unleashed" [...] and comparing it to how people see Bill Nighy as Davy Jones in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Blackman noted that Witwer brought new ideas {{and a sense of}} humanity to Starkiller. Sam Witwer has said that Starkiller would be a character he wouldn't mind revisiting.|$|E
500|$|Will and Jake have a {{complicated}} relationship; Jake is the smaller, younger, more sensitive of the two. Will is often <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> Jake (dating {{all the way}} back to their childhood, when Jake sold the family cow to an old man in exchange for [...] "magic beans" [...] instead of money for a doctor; resulting in their sickly younger sister's death) berating and ordering him around. Will is somewhat of a womanizer and wants to make money, whereas Jake is more interested in fairy tales and adventures. Jake feels that Will doesn't care about or believe in him; but even into their adulthood, Will is still very pained by the loss of their sister and blames Jake's belief in magic and happy endings for her death. This feeling of resentment is compounded with Will's intense desire to protect Jake, at times from himself.|$|E
500|$|Playing a {{recurring}} character on sister series , guest star Aron Eisenberg (Kar) quelled rumors {{that he was}} given the part simply because of his Star Trek heritage. [...] He emphasized that he read for the part like any other actor, and felt that he was chosen because the Voyager crew could not find a child actor who could meet muster, nor an adult actor who looked young enough for the part. [...] In an interview with Star Trek: The Official Monthly Magazine, Eisenberg felt that he worked <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the episode, and that his musculature was a boon to playing [...] "a warrior kid." [...] Fellow DS9 actor Max Grodénchik was his acting coach for [...] "Initiations". [...] On Kar, Eisenberg played the character {{on the other end of}} the spectrum from his Nog character, so much so that he wasn't worried about any of Nog's characterizations or idiosyncrasies showing through.|$|E
60|$|With these reflections, and a <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> knock <b>on</b> {{the crown}} of his unfortunate hat at each {{repetition}} of the last word, Newman Noggs, whose brain was a little muddled by {{so much of the}} contents of the pocket-pistol as had found their way there during his recent concealment, went forth to seek such consolation as might be derivable from the beef and greens of some cheap eating-house.|$|R

500|$|In 1995, {{one year}} after the start of the Shia-led 1990s {{uprising}} in Bahrain, Khalid bin Ahmed publicly distributed a [...] "politically charged poem" [...] that contained [...] "racist and hateful views" [...] of the Shia. One verse of the poem called for [...] "spill their bloods until they all die", another called for [...] "remov them from every sensitive position". Khalaf said the poem was [...] "part of the tribal-cum-ethnic-cum-political mobilization and counter mobilization". According to Michael Field, Khalid [...] "as reputation for being <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the Shias". Freedom House mentioned that the Khawalid brothers [...] "espouse a decidedly anti-Shiite agenda, conceiving of the community as a veritable fifth column to be dealt with in the framework of security, rather than through political bargaining". The sectarian violence and rise of Shia powers in Iraq have only strengthened this belief. This view of Shia as a security problem led the Khawalid brothers to consider any economic and political reforms as invalid. Instead they thought that these reforms would only lead the Shia to demand even more.|$|E
500|$|Bachchan {{said that}} Sam was his most {{difficult}} character to play, {{and he worked}} hard on his gestures and mannerisms: [...] "I had {{to work very hard}} to portray a straight man acting gay. It could easily have gone over-board. I wanted to avoid making the character caricatural [...] Barring one portion ... we kept it controlled." [...] Bachchan and Abraham, who had gained weight for their earlier films, had to lose the weight and become more muscular. Although Chopra agreed to wear a swimsuit, she refused to wear a bikini. The actress said that that she did not lose any weight (as the media speculated), but worked out for a toned look in her films; she was also filming Fashion (2008) at the time. According to Chopra, [...] "For Fashion, I had to put on six kilos and later had to shed chip by chip as the character progressed in the film. My body structure in Dostana is more toned than in Fashion as it is a completely beach film. I've worked <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> my body." ...|$|E
500|$|Bart's ballet {{teacher was}} voiced by Susan Sarandon, and was {{designed}} {{to look a little}} bit like her. Sarandon had wanted to guest star on the show because her children were big fans; she brought them with her to the recording session. Due to a traffic jam, she was late for the recording session, but once she arrived, she fell into character and worked <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> getting her accent accurate. Sarandon would later have a cameo appearance as the voice of a computer in the season 17 episode [...] "Bart Has Two Mommies". Mel Brooks has a cameo appearance as himself. His wife Anne Bancroft had {{played a role in the}} episode [...] "Fear of Flying" [...] and Brooks had accompanied her to the recording session. David Mirkin realized that Brooks was [...] "dying to do the show" [...] and asked him if he would be willing to do a guest part, and he agreed.

500|$|In 1984, while {{promoting}} the film This Is Spinal Tap, Shearer, Christopher Guest and Michael McKean had a performance on Saturday Night Live. All three members were offered {{the chance to}} join to the show in the 1984–1985 season. Shearer accepted because he was treated well by the producers and he thought the backstage environment had improved but later stated that he [...] "didn't realize that guests are treated better than the regulars." [...] Guest also accepted the offer while McKean rejected it, although he would join the cast in 1994. Dick Ebersol, who replaced Lorne Michaels as the show's producer, said that Shearer was [...] "a gifted performer but {{a pain in the}} butt. He's just so demanding on the preciseness of things and he's very, <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> the working people. He's just a nightmare-to-deal-with person." [...] In January 1985, Shearer left the show for good, partially because he felt he was not being used enough. Martin Short said Shearer [...] "wanted to be creative and Dick [...] wanted something else. [...] I think he felt his voice wasn't getting represented on the show. When he wouldn't get that chance, it made him very upset." ...|$|E

[...] When Gilbert {{gave it to me}} at the first reading he said, 'Here you are, Jessie, you needn't act this, it's you.'" [...] Gilbert was even more nervous than usual on the first night of Yeomen and came backstage to give his best wishes to the cast. [...] Bond wrote, [...] "I am afraid he made himself a perfect nuisance behind the scenes, and did his best, poor fellow, to upset us all. These first nights were <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> me... and nearly always my understudy was called upon to officiate on the second night of a play, while I lay exhausted in my bed.

500|$|Chloe is {{characterized}} as a [...] "dynamic fashion guru" [...] by Global BC and a [...] "bad girl" [...] by Soap Opera Digest. Hendrickson expressed her happiness in playing a [...] "manipulative" [...] character who takes advantage of people. She said, [...] "I get to play, not only this edgy, spicy kind of character, but she's actually pretty funny too, so it's nice to bring some humor into it as well." [...] Chloe is a [...] "bitchy" [...] stylist who is hired at Jabot Cosmetics as a fashion consultant. Explaining her initial portrayal of Chloe, Hendrickson stated, [...] "I {{was the one who}} wanted to make her edgy and funny. Most of the people I know who are in the fashion business are a little bitchy. I wanted to make Chloe interesting, instead of just playing her like some girl who was putting on fancy clothes. There was no conflict there. The writers definitely gave me that in the writing, and I tweaked it a little. They seemed to enjoy it. Each day, Chloe kept getting funnier and bitchier." [...] She first works with young model Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), the new face of Jabot whom she treats harshly. According to Hendrickson, Chloe [...] "takes her job very seriously. [...] is used to working with more professional models and is <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>on</b> Lily regarding, you know, keeping up some sort of appearance if you will, regarding the fashion industry, which is weight. So [...] starts to give [...] a little weight complex because she is constantly throwing in her face that either she doesn't fit into things or they have to make things larger for her, etc." ...|$|E
