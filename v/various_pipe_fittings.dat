40|$|Fluid transients, {{also known}} as water hammer, can have a {{significant}} impact on the design and operation of both spacecraft and launch vehicles propulsion systems. These transients often occur at system activation and shut down. For ground safety reasons, many spacecrafts are launched with the propellant lines dry. These lines are often evacuated by the time the spacecraft reaches orbit. When the propellant isolation valve opens during propulsion system activation, propellant rushes into lines creating a pressure surge. During propellant system shutdown, a pressure surge is created due to sudden closure of a valve. During both activation and shutdown, pressure surges must be predicted accurately to ensure structural integrity of the propulsion system fluid network. The method of characteristics is the most widely used method of calculating fluid transients in pipeline [1, 2]. The method of characteristics, however, has limited applications in calculating flow distribution in complex flow circuits with phase change, heat transfer and rotational effects. A robust cryogenic propulsion system analyzer must have the capability to handle phase change, heat transfer, chemical reaction, rotational effects and fluid transients in conjunction with subsystem flow model for pumps, valves and <b>various</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>fittings.</b> In recent years, such a task has been undertaken at Marshall Space Flight Center with the development of the Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program (GFSSP), which is based on finite volume method in fluid network [3]. GFSSP has been extensively verified and validated by comparing its predictions with test data and other numerical methods for various applications such as internal flow of turbo-pump [4], propellant tank pressurization [5, 6], chilldown of cryogenic transfer line [7] and squeeze film damper rotordynamics [8]. The purpose of the present paper is to investigate the applicability of the finite volume method to predict fluid transient in cryogenic flow circuits...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{details the}} results of {{fieldwork}} research {{on the effect of}} <b>pipe</b> <b>fittings</b> on particle accumulation in a drinking water network (DWN). The term, affected section of <b>pipe</b> <b>fitting</b> (ASPF) is introduced, which is the length of pipe beyond the <b>pipe</b> <b>fitting</b> where the temporal deposition/erosion processes of particles, due to the daily hydraulics, leads to higher concentrations of particles on the pipe walls. The lengths of the ASPF were calculated to be 5. 31 – 299. 40 m. In order to quantify the mass of particles washed out of fire-hydrants, the resuspension potential method (RPM) or uni-directional flushing (UDF) program, were performed on four different DWNs (populations < 10 000 – 700 000; network length: 20 – 1374 km; DN 100 – DN 250 mm). The flow and turbidity during flushing was measured with online instruments. A relation was found between the concentration of total solids (TS) analysed from grab samples and the turbidity measured with online equipment: 1 NTU = 0. 303 mg/l (n = 63). The turbidity potential of accumulated particles for the ASPF was suggested as coefficient (J) and varied from 1. 02 – 3. 74. The total mass of particles accumulated in either the ASPF or straight sections varied from 0. 57 – 7. 14 g/m (n = 24) and 0. 46 – 5. 79 g/m (n = 21), respectively. Therefore, <b>pipe</b> <b>fittings</b> have greater amounts of dry mass compared with straight sections of pipe, which {{can be explained by the}} inertial effects of <b>pipe</b> <b>fittings...</b>|$|R

40|$|Residual {{stresses}} {{can play}} a key role in the SCC performance of susceptible materials in PWR primary water applications. Residual stresses are stresses stored within the metal that develop during deformation and persist in the absence of external forces or temperature gradients. Sources of residual stresses in <b>pipe</b> <b>fittings</b> include fabrication processes, installation and welding. There are a number of methods to characterize the magnitude and orientation of residual stresses. These include numerical analysis, chemical cracking tests, and measurement (e. g., X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, strain gage/hole drilling, strain gage/trepanning, strain gage/section and layer removal, and acoustics). This paper presents 400 C steam SCC test results demonstrating that residual stresses in as-fabricated Alloy 600 <b>pipe</b> <b>fittings</b> are sufficient to induce SCC.
