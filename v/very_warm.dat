5|$|The {{climate of}} Japan is {{predominantly}} temperate, but varies greatly {{from north to}} south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and <b>very</b> <b>warm</b> to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{east has}} a more {{continental}} climate: winters can be very cold and summers <b>very</b> <b>warm,</b> and longer dry periods can occur. Central and southern Germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental. In addition to the maritime and continental climates that predominate {{over most of the}} country, the Alpine regions in the extreme south and, to a lesser degree, some areas of the Central German Uplands have a mountain climate, with lower temperatures and more precipitation.|$|E

5|$|Irene {{entered the}} Atlantic Ocean near Jupiter, Florida early on October 16, {{still as a}} Category1 hurricane. It turned to the north, {{remained}} a hurricane despite little convection, {{then turned to the}} northeast in response to an approaching upper-level trough. Just offshore, Irene moved parallel to the coastlines of South Carolina and North Carolina on October 17. On October 18, as it interacted with <b>very</b> <b>warm</b> ocean waters and the upper level trough, Irene rapidly intensified, reaching peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) with a pressure of 952mbar, a Category 2 hurricane. Despite its strength, the circulation was very asymmetrical, and the convection was not particularly organized. The hurricane continued to accelerate to the northeast, steadily weakening until becoming extratropical on October 19 to the south of Newfoundland. The extratropical storm continued to the northeast until becoming absorbed by another, larger extratropical storm late that same day.|$|E
5|$|Late on November6, Ida re-emerged over water, {{entering}} the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Upon moving back over water, the storm quickly began to redevelop, with convection increasing around {{the center of}} circulation. Early on November7, Ida restrengthened into a tropical storm as it tracked just west of due north. <b>Very</b> <b>warm</b> sea surface temperatures ahead of the system would have allowed for substantial intensification; however, wind shear over the area quickly increased, resulting in modest strengthening. Later that day, the storm turned northwestward {{in response to a}} strong trough over Mexico and a mid-level ridge extending from the Southeast United States to Hispaniola. As Ida neared the Yucatán Channel, an eye redeveloped and the storm quickly intensified into a hurricane. By the morning of November8, the storm had attained Category2 status with winds of 100mph (155km/h).|$|E

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} usually require <b>very</b> <b>warm</b> {{water to}} depth, generally above 26.5°C (80°F) extending {{to a depth}} of 50meters (160ft). However, the waters off California are cold even in summer. They rarely rise above 24°C (75°F) in near-shore southern California, and usually remain below 17°C (63°F) along {{most of the rest of}} the coast and outer coastal waters, although El Niño events may warm the waters somewhat. This is due primarily to the extensive upwelling of colder sub-surface waters caused by the prevailing northwesterly winds acting through the Ekman Effect. The winds drive surface water to the right of the wind flow, that is offshore, which draws water up from below to replace it. The upwelling further cools the already cool California Current which runs north to south along coastal California and even much of coastal Baja California. This is the same mechanism which produces coastal California's characteristic fog.|$|E
5|$|Upon developing, the {{depression}} {{was located in}} an area of weak steering currents, resulting in an erratic movement generally to the south. In its formative stages, {{the depression}} executed a small loop. As it did so, it moved into an area of <b>very</b> <b>warm</b> waters and decreasing wind shear. The depression's convection gradually organized, although the winds were slower to increase. An anticyclone became established over the system, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Lorenzo at around 1200UTC on September27. At the time, it was located about 150mi (240km) east of Tuxpan, Veracruz, moving steadily westward under the influence of a building ridge to its east. As it approached the coast, Lorenzo rapidly intensified unexpectedly, and within 12hours of attaining tropical storm status it strengthened into a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{jet stream}} moved {{northeast}} across the Great Plains region {{and a strong}} surface low in western Kansas strengthened as it moved to the Nebraska-South Dakota border. Ahead of the low, <b>very</b> <b>warm</b> and moist air spread throughout the South Central United States into Nebraska, eastern sections of South Dakota and the upper Mississippi Valley. The combination of strong winds and warm and moist air created conditions favorable for strong thunderstorms. On June 5, {{a high risk of}} severe weather was issued for six different states in the Midwestern United States, with a moderate risk area surrounding the high risk area. Forecasters had warned of a potentially historic outbreak, as computer forecasting models for June 5resembled those on June 8, 1974, when 39tornadoes struck the southern Great Plains and killed 22people. Wichita State University canceled evening classes because of the weather predictions. Severe weather began developing across eastern Colorado and northwestern Kansas during the morning and into the early afternoon, producing several weak tornadoes in the process. An EF1tornado impacted a campground near Kellogg, Iowa and injured two people. Despite extremely favorable conditions, severe weather for the day was limited and the tornadoes generally caused minimal damage.|$|E

5|$|After the <b>very</b> <b>warm</b> {{practice}} sessions, qualifying on Saturday was run under difficult weather conditions. Qualifying one (Q1) {{started on}} a damp track and therefore on intermediate tyres, while by Q2 the track was almost dry and slick tyres were used. In Q1 Romain Grosjean collided with the slower running HRT of Pedro de la Rosa and lost his front wing. While he succeeded in nursing the car back into the pit lane, {{he was unable to}} change his tyres and was therefore left in a disappointing 18th position on the grid. Michael Schumacher's last ever qualifying did not go well either. He took 14th position, almost half a second down on his teammate, admitting he had perhaps compromised his setup too much for an expected wet race. The McLarens were fastest all weekend and easily took the front row, with Lewis Hamilton securing his last pole position with the team. Title contenders Vettel and Alonso both struggled, taking 4th and 8th position on the grid respectively. Pastor Maldonado was handed a 10-place grid penalty for missing the weighbridge {{in the second part of}} qualifying. He dropped from sixth to 16th, moving Alonso one place up to seventh.|$|E
5|$|Due to low {{amounts of}} {{vertical}} shear, <b>very</b> <b>warm</b> waters, and abundant moisture, steady intensification was forecast, and the depression strengthened to Tropical Storm John later on August 28. Deep convection continued to develop over the storm, while an eye feature developed within the expanding central dense overcast. The storm continued to intensify, and John attained hurricane status on August 29 while 190miles (305km) south-southeast of Acapulco. Banding features {{continued to increase}} as the hurricane moved west-northwestward around the southwest periphery of a mid- to upper-level ridge over northern Mexico. The hurricane underwent rapid intensification, and John attained major hurricane status 12hours after becoming a hurricane. Shortly thereafter, the eye became obscured, and the intensity remained at 115mph (185km/h) due to an eyewall replacement cycle. Another eye formed, and based on Reconnaissance data, the hurricane attained Category4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on August 30 about 160miles (260km) west of Acapulco, or 95miles (155km) south of Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán. Hours later, the hurricane underwent another eyewall replacement cycle, and subsequently weakened to Category3 status as it paralleled the Mexican coastline a short distance offshore.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after peaking in intensity, the {{hurricane}} again weakened as it underwent an eyewall replacement cycle. At 1415UTC on September 12 Ivan passed 25miles (40km) south-southwest of George Town, Cayman Islands, where sustained winds of 150mph (240km/h) were reported. The storm surge from {{the hurricane}} flooded all of Grand Cayman Island. After its eyewall became re-established Ivan attained Category5 status {{for a third}} time early on September 13. Shortly thereafter, a trough created a weakness in the ridge to its north, causing the hurricane to turn to the northwest. The combination of enhanced outflow from the trough and <b>very</b> <b>warm</b> waters allowed Ivan to maintain Category5 status for 30hours. Early on September 14 the hurricane passed through the Yucatán Channel about 17miles (28km) southwest of Cabo San Antonio, Cuba, with the eastern portion of the eyewall crossing the western portion of the island. Only the extreme western portion of the island experienced hurricane-force winds, although rainfall from the hurricane was reported across the island.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was experiencing slight easterly wind shear, which distorted the convection {{to the west}} of the circulation. However, favorable conditions for strengthening were expected, and the depression was forecast to reach peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) before weakening. It tracked slowly northwestward along the southern periphery of a ridge, and quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Kristy after convection increased over its circulation center. By that time, wind shear had decreased to very low levels, and with <b>very</b> <b>warm</b> waters, the storm was expected to quickly intensify to reach hurricane status. By late on August30, the convection was wrapping into the center while an eye feature became intermittent. Organization continued, and Kristy attained hurricane status early on August31, about 30hours after forming. Six hours after attaining hurricane status, an eye-like featured was evident on satellite imagery, and it is estimated Kristy attained peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) about 550mi (880km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California. However, satellite-derived intensity estimates suggested the hurricane could have been as strong as 105mph (170km/h), or as weak as a tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical cyclone, the tropical depression had a broad circulation and organized deep convection. It was located over <b>very</b> <b>warm</b> water temperatures, although the upper-level environment was not conducive for significant intensification. Easterly wind shear was forecast, but the NHC anticipated the depression strengthening to 45mph (75km/h) before making landfall in Louisiana. Under {{the influence of a}} mid-level ridge to its north, the depression was forecast to track generally northwestward. Early on August11, the convection diminished significantly due to the entrainment of dry air and vertical wind shear from a nearby upper-level low. The circulation became difficult to locate; however, conditions favored the redevelopment of the thunderstorm activity. One tropical cyclone prediction model forecast significant intensification to a minimum pressure of 968mbar, and other models forecast the depression would reach hurricane status upon making landfall. As it continued to the northwest, the circulation remained broad and disorganized, and convection remained minimal. Late on August11, a Hurricane Hunters flight reported that the depression was no longer a tropical cyclone, and in post-analysis, the NHC determined that the depression was only a tropical cyclone for 12hours. Redevelopment was not anticipated.|$|E
5|$|When Alex {{was still}} located over the Yucatán Peninsula, the NHC remarked upon the {{potential}} for significant strengthening. Because of low wind shear and <b>very</b> <b>warm</b> water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, the possibility existed that Alex could intensify into a major hurricanea Category3 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scalebefore its next landfall. Early on June28, thunderstorm activity had reformed over the center, and the depression re-intensified into a tropical storm. For the next day, the combination of dry air, increasing wind shear and slightly cooler water temperatures prevented significant convection from developing over the center. At the same time, Alex was moving slowly off the northwest coast of the Yucatán Peninsula, and the environment's conditions became more favorable for intensification as the tropical storm tracked away from the coast. The circulation envelope of Alex remained very large, and by June29, the storm's rainbands covered the entire western half of the Gulf of Mexico; rainfall was reported along the Texas and Louisiana coasts, even while the center was still several hundred miles offshore. The tropical storm continued to strengthen, and based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, {{it is estimated that}} Alex attained hurricane status at 0300UTC on June30, about 255miles (415km) southeast of Brownsville, Texas.|$|E

5|$|With <b>very</b> <b>warm</b> {{sea surface}} temperatures, high ocean heat content, low wind shear, and a moist air mass, Omar quickly {{reached its peak}} {{intensity}} early on October16 as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130mph (215km/h). During the intensification phase, the forward motion of the hurricane increased to 20mph (32km/h). Once in the Atlantic Ocean, Omar began to rapidly weaken, with winds decreasing by 50mph (85km/h) in 12 hours. Visible satellite images depicted an exposed low-level circulation with convection displaced to the east due {{to a combination of}} very high wind shear and dry air. By October17, most of the deep convection associated with the system dissipated; however, a brief decrease in wind shear allowed Omar to re-strengthen to its secondary peak, with winds of 85mph (140km/h). During this phase, convection redeveloped around the center and an eye reformed. Later that day, the trough that caused the rapid northeastern motion bypassed Omar, leading to decreasing movement.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of land, only gradual weakening occurred initially after Odile made landfall. However, a combination of increasingly southwesterly wind shear and the Baja California Peninsula's mountainous terrain began to take its toll on the hurricane, weakening it to a tropical storm by September16. Although the storm's convection was thinning out, Odile retained a well-organized satellite appearance and occasional bursts of thunderstorm activity. On September17, a nearby mid-level ridge steered the system slowly northeastward, moving Odile into the Gulf of California as a moderate tropical storm. Despite the <b>very</b> <b>warm</b> waters, the emergence of wind shear and land interaction offset otherwise favorable conditions. Odile continued to weaken as its convection sped northeastwards into Mexico and the southwestern United States. After turning northward and then northeastward {{in response to a}} mid-latitude trough, Odile moved inland over {{the northern part of the}} Mexican state of Sonora about near Alvaro Obregón as a marginal tropical storm. By doing so, Odile became the first tropical storm to make landfall north of 30°N in Mexico since Hurricane Nora of 1997. At 21:00UTC on September17, the NHC determined that the tropical storm had degenerated into a remnant area of low-pressure inland over northwestern mainland Mexico. The remnant circulation of Odile continued to track northeastward, entering extreme southeastern Arizona by 09:00UTC on September18. This circulation dissipated by September19, just east of the border between Arizona and New Mexico, leaving behind a marked mass of thunderstorms which persisted across the region for the next several days.|$|E
