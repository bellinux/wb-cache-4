25|$|During the Hellenistic period, {{the light}} trireme was supplanted by larger {{warships}} in dominant navies, especially the pentere/quinquereme. The maximum practical number of oar banks a ship could have was three. So {{the number in}} the type name did not refer to the banks of oars any more (as for biremes and triremes), but {{to the number of}} rowers per <b>vertical</b> <b>section,</b> with several men on each oar. The reason for this development was the increasing use of armour on the bows of warships against ramming attacks, which again required heavier ships for a successful attack. This increased the number of rowers per ship, and also made it possible to use less well-trained personnel for moving these new ships. This change was accompanied by an increased reliance on tactics like boarding, missile skirmishes and using warships as platforms for artillery.|$|E
40|$|Mean glomerular volume has {{previously}} been estimated, using stereological techniques, specifically the point-sampled intercept (PSI), either from isotropic or from <b>vertical</b> <b>sections.</b> As glomeruli are approximately spherical structures, the same stereological technique was carried out on <b>vertical</b> and arbitrary <b>sections</b> to determine whether section orientation had any effect on mean glomerular volume estimation. Equine kidneys from 10 individuals were analysed using the PSI method of estimating volume-weighted mean glomerular volume (MGV); for each kidney, arbitrary and <b>vertical</b> <b>sections</b> were analysed. MGVs {{were not significantly different}} between arbitrary and <b>vertical</b> <b>sections</b> (P = 0. 691) when analysing the data with the paired t test; when plotting MGV estimates from arbitrary sections against those from <b>vertical</b> <b>sections</b> the intercept was found not to be significantly different from zero (P > 0. 8) and the slope of the regression line not to be significantly different from 1. 0 (P > 0. 4). For the estimation of MGV in equine kidneys using PSI, arbitrary sections may be used if {{it is not possible to}} use isotropic or <b>vertical</b> <b>sections,</b> but some caution must be exercised in the interpretation of results so gained...|$|R

25|$|The {{tongue is}} a muscular hydrostat that forms {{part of the}} floor of the oral cavity. The left and right sides of the tongue are {{separated}} by a <b>vertical</b> <b>section</b> of fibrous tissue known as the lingual septum. This division is {{along the length of the}} tongue save for the very back of the pharyngeal part and is visible as a groove called the median sulcus. The human tongue is divided into anterior and posterior parts by the terminal sulcus which is a V-shaped groove. The apex of the terminal sulcus is marked by a blind foramen, the foramen cecum, which is the remnant of median thyroid diverticulum in early embryonic development. The anterior oral part is the visible part situated at the front and makes up roughly two-thirds the length of the tongue. The posterior pharyngeal part is the part closest to the throat, roughly one-third of its length. These parts differ in terms of their embryological development and nerve supply.|$|E

The architecture of the vascular tree in the human placenta makes it appropriate to use <b>vertical</b> histological <b>sections.</b> Describing tubules, estimates of total length and diameter are informative. The aim {{of the study was}} to derive a new stereological estimator of the total length of circular tubules observed in thin <b>vertical</b> <b>sections.</b> Design: Dual perfusion fixed human placentas. Systematic, uniformly random sampling of <b>vertical</b> <b>sections.</b> Five-μm-sections were stained by haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and the vertical axis was identified in all sections. A test system with cycloid test lines was used. Since tubular surface area is proportional to length and diameter, S ∝ πdL, surface-weightening is equivalent to diameter×lengthweightening. As each diameter (extra weight) is known, one may eliminate the diameter-weightening by computing the harmonic mean diameter, which is thus the correct, length-weighted mean tubular diameter, dL = d hS. Surface area is estimated in the ordinary way from <b>vertical</b> <b>sections,</b> and with unbiased and robust estimates of S and dL respectively, total length may be estimated L = S / πdhs Conclusion: A new stereological estimator of total length of a circular tubular structure observed in thin <b>vertical</b> <b>sections</b> is presented...|$|R
500|$|The maximum {{practical}} {{number of}} oar ranks a ship could have logistically was three (Greek and Latin tri-).

[...] Indeed, just because a ship was designated with a larger type number did not mean it necessarily had or operated all three possible ranks: the quadrireme may have been a simple evolution of a standard trireme, but with two rowers on the top oar; it may also have been a bireme with two men on each oar; or it may just have had a single rank with four men on a each single oar.

40|$|Sampling schemes {{developed}} {{for use with}} a geometric model of rat small bowel are tested against a design-based scheme (<b>vertical</b> <b>sectioning</b> with cycloid test lines) which offers unbiased estimates of surface amplifications due to villi. The model-based methods comprise transverse and longitudinal sectioning coupled with putative correction factors. Comparisons are based on proximal, middle and distal segments of six small bowels. Transverse and longitudinal sections through the same segments of each animal were analysed by conventional intersection counting (using straight test lines). Appropriate intersection ratios were multiplied by their respective correction factors in order to calculate surface amplifications. Longitudinal sections were employed further as <b>vertical</b> <b>sections</b> and intersections were counted with cycloid arcs to obtain unbiased estimates of surface amplifications. Both model-based schemes (transverse and longitudinal) gave group mean values similar to those obtained by <b>vertical</b> <b>sectioning.</b> Therefore, {{the use of a}} geometric model in past studies on rat small bowel can now be justified on grounds of negligible bias...|$|R

2500|$|The human tongue has {{an unusual}} shape. In most mammals, it's a long, flat {{structure}} contained largely within the mouth. It is attached {{at the rear}} to the hyoid bone, situated below oral level in the pharynx. In humans, the tongue has an almost circular sagittal (midline) contour, much of it lying vertically down an extended pharynx, where it {{is attached to a}} hyoid bone in a lowered position. Partly as a result of this, the horizontal (inside-the-mouth) and vertical (down-the-throat) tubes forming the supralaryngeal vocal tract (SVT) are almost equal in length (whereas in other species, the <b>vertical</b> <b>section</b> is shorter). As we move our jaws up and down, the tongue can vary the cross-sectional area of each tube independently by about 10:1, altering formant frequencies accordingly. That the tubes are joined at a right angle permits pronunciation of the vowels , [...] and , which nonhuman primates cannot do.
