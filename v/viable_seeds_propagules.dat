30|$|Replacement {{of native}} topsoil on mine sites, {{especially}} for uses such as forest, {{is important for}} three reasons. First, <b>viable</b> <b>seeds</b> and <b>propagules</b> contained in the soil provide a seed bank to enable restoration of native species. Second, organic matter in the native soil contains essential soil nutrients for plant growth. Third, soil-dwelling animals and microorganisms in the native soil aid in providing and cycling nutrients for plants, create channels for air and water movement, and promote favorable hydrologic properties. Soil {{should be considered a}} “living resource” and re-spread immediately when possible.|$|R
40|$|A {{riparian}} {{seed bank}} is a reserve of <b>viable</b> <b>seeds</b> and <b>propagules</b> in sediments {{of a river}} channel, channel bank and adjacent floodplain. Dispersal of seeds by water is termed hydrochory. Over the last 20 years, geomorphologists and ecologists have recognized the role of vegetation as an important control on the form and stability of river margins. There is now increasing recognition that these two areas of interest should be integrated {{in order to improve}} riparian management strategies that enhance the natural recovery mechanisms of river systems. However, our understanding of the dynamics of the riparian seed bank remains poor, particularly in an Australian context. Hydrochoric seeds are subject to the same forces as sediment in a river system. Sediment (and seeds) are sourced, transported and stored at various positions in a catchment. Hence, the mechanisms by which sediment is transported and deposited is a key control on the dispersal and storage mechanisms of seeds in the channel and riparian zone of rivers. In this presentation we will introduce background principles of riparian seedbank science and outline some of our research occurring in Wollombi Brook and Watagan Creek, eastern NSW. Through postdoctoral and PhD research we are designing experiments to: 1) Determine the type, volume, structure and viability of the soil seed bank within different geomorphic units and compare it to seed rain and extant vegetation associations. 2) Determine the relationship between hydrology, geomorphic structure and seedbank dynamics along intact riparian corridors. 3) Develop guidelines for best practice river rehabilitation based on an understanding of sediment transport and storage and seed bank dynamics. 1 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Background/Question/Methods The {{introduced}} haplotype of Phragmites australis is {{an aggressive}} invader {{and has a}} negative effect on many aspects of wetland ecosystems in North America. In Chesapeake Bay subestuaries it was more abundant and had higher foliar N in wetlands with developed vs. forested watersheds. Little is known, however, about factors responsible for its spread and success. We addressed the following questions: Are within- and among-patch genetic variation an indicator of spread by seeds vs. rhizomes and do they vary by the level of watershed development? Does seed viability vary across wetlands in different watersheds? Is there a relationship between <b>viable</b> <b>seed</b> production and Phragmites seedling emergence from the seed bank? Do nutrients and cross pollination influence <b>viable</b> <b>seed</b> production? Do environmental and stand conditions affect recruitment of Phragmites from seeds or rhizome? Results/Conclusions High levels of genetic diversity were found both within and among patches, particularly in developed watersheds, indicating the importance of sexual reproduction in Phragmites spread. <b>Viable</b> <b>seed</b> production varied greatly within and among subestuaries but was highest in patches in developed watersheds. High <b>viable</b> <b>seed</b> production resulted in a greater number of seedlings emerging from the seed bank. Patches with 3 ̆e 1 genotype produced more <b>viable</b> <b>seeds</b> and <b>viable</b> <b>seed</b> production was greater for out-crossed plants.

40|$|Background/Question/Methods An exotic {{haplotype}} of Phragmites australis {{is rapidly}} invading wetlands across North America {{where it can}} form large monotypic stands and out-compete native vegetation. In the Chesapeake Bay, Phragmites is more abundant in subestuaries in developed watersheds. Little is known, however, about how this plant spreads and what factors may contribute to its success. Our study addressed the role of sexual reproduction and potential for spread by seed in the invasion of Phragmites in the Chesapeake Bay. We evaluated <b>viable</b> <b>seed</b> production in 45 Phragmites patches from 9 subestuaries with different levels of watershed development (3 forested, 3 mixed-developed, 3 developed) to determine {{the potential impact of}} land-use on reproductive output.

40|$|The {{potential}} for seed-eating birds to spread <b>viable</b> <b>seeds</b> was investigated using captive-feeding trials to determine seed preference, passage time through the gut, and viability of passed seeds for bronzewing pigeons (Phaps chalcoptera), peaceful doves (Geopelia striata), crested pigeons (Ocyphaps lophotes), Senegal doves (Streptopelia senegalensis), zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), black ducks (Anas superciliosa) and wood ducks (Chenonetta jubata). Test seeds were bladder clover (Trifolium spumosum), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum), gorse (Ulex europaeus), canola (Brassica napus) and red panicum (Setaria italica). Their consumption was {{compared with that}} of commercial seed mixes. Although all test seeds were recognizable foods, their consumption usually decreased in the presence of other foods, except for canola, where consumption rates were maintained. Hard-seeded bladder clover was the only species where <b>viable</b> <b>seeds</b> were passed by obligate seedeaters. In contrast, <b>viable</b> <b>seeds</b> of canola and gorse were passed by seed-eating omnivorous/ herbivorous ducks, although the germination of passed seeds (42 %) was reduced significantly {{compared with that of}} untreated control seed (67 %). Field validation with wild, urban bronzewings and Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) offered canola and commercial seed yielded similar outcomes, with a range of <b>viable</b> <b>seeds</b> recovered from magpie soft pellets. Mean seed passage time in captive birds ranged from 0. 5 to 4. 3 h for all test seeds and commercial seed mixes, suggesting that these bird species may potentially disperse seed over moderate distances. Despite the low probability of individual birds spreading <b>viable</b> <b>seed,</b> the high number of birds feeding in the wild suggests that the {{potential for}} granivorous and seed-eating omnivorous birds to disperse <b>viable</b> <b>seeds</b> cannot be discounted, particularly if exozoochorous dispersal is also considered...|$|R

Seedling emergence following recent clearing was monitored {{for a year}} at one site of each species. Percentage {{viability of}} A. saligna seed banks was uniformly high and was not affected by age since clearing. Percentage dormancy in A. saligna was high since few seedlings emerged in the field (1 % of <b>viable</b> <b>seed</b> bank), but after fire, 70 % of the remaining <b>viable</b> <b>seed</b> bank germinated. Percentage viability of A. cyclops seed banks differed significantly among sites, with the proportion of <b>viable</b> <b>seeds</b> in the soil increasing significantly with age since clearing at one site. Percentage germination and viability of fresh A. cyclops seeds also differed significantly among sites. Although seedling emergence in A. cyclops (9 % of <b>viable</b> <b>seed</b> bank) exceeded that in A. saligna, pre-emergence mortality was implicated as the more important process in A. cyclops seed bank decline.

Is the presence of <b>viable</b> <b>seeds</b> from dung correlated with specific seed traits? Location: Calcareous grasslands, South Limburg, the Netherlands/Belgium. Methods: Dung samples (n= 24) from sheep were collected between September 2006 and November 2007 from five sites with Mesobromion plant communities, and communities of Nardo-Galion saxatilis. Germinability and identity of seeds in the dung samples were ascertained from germination of seedlings under glasshouse conditions. Seed traits of species with <b>viable</b> <b>seeds</b> in dung were compared with those present in the local species pool. Results: Seventy-two plant species from 23 plant families had <b>viable</b> <b>seeds</b> in sheep dung. The plant families encountered most frequently were Gramineae and Compositae. The most abundant and frequently recorded plant species in dung samples was Urtica dioica, accounting for > 80 % {{of the total number}} of seeds.

Seeds with low seed mass and a high seed longevity index were over-represented in dung. <b>Viable</b> <b>seeds</b> > 2. 5 mg were infrequent in the dung samples. Conclusions: We conclude that sheep are potentially important dispersers of plant species in Dutch calcareous grasslands.

40|$|We {{compared}} seed banks {{between two}} contrasting anthropogenic surface disturbances (compacted, trenched) and adjacent undisturbed controls {{to determine whether}} site condition influences <b>viable</b> <b>seed</b> densities of perennial and annual Mojave Desert species. <b>Viable</b> <b>seeds</b> of perennials were rare in undisturbed areas (3 – 4 seeds/m 2) and declined to 3 ̆c 1 seed/m 2 within disturbed sites. Annual seed densities were {{an order of magnitude}} greater than those of perennials, were one-third the undisturbed seed densities on compacted sites, but doubled on trenched sites relative to controls. On trenched sites, greater litter cover comprising the infructescences of the dominant spring annuals, and low gravel content, enhanced seed densities of both annuals and perennials.

40|$|General EcologyThis {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the Great Lakes endemic Cirsium pitcheri, Pitcher’s thistle, exhibits overcompensation following damage to its apical meristem. We addressed the following questions: (1) Does pollination frequency differ between single-stemmed and multi-stemmed individuals? (2) Is there a difference in fitness between single-stemmed and multi-stemmed individuals? To assess these questions, we observed potential pollinator rates, head counts and diameters, and <b>viable</b> <b>seed</b> sets on both undamaged and damaged Pitcher’s thistles. Total potential pollinator visits and pollination time per flowering head were significantly greater on multi-stemmed thistles.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the impact of runoff water and soil erosion on the dispersal of weed seeds in small cultivated catchments. Water samples and soil samples were collected from eight hydrological stations in the Houay Pano headwater catchment, near Lak Sip village in northern Laos, during the first big event of the rainy season in 2005 (7 th June, 2005). Samples were also taken from the topsoil near each station {{before the beginning of}} the rainy season. The number of <b>viable</b> <b>seeds</b> was determined for each sample using the simple seedling-emergence method. The rainstorm generated an outflow of approximately 4, 000 kg of suspended material including some 970, 000 <b>viable</b> weed <b>seeds,</b> transported by runoff water. Most of the seeds that left the catchment (an area of 64. 6 ha) were troublesome composite weeds and grasses. The same rainfall event also generated a sediment load of 1, 100 kg of soil that was trapped in the tank of the outlet (drained from 8. 4 ha).
