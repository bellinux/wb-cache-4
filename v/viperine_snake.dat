40|$|The {{activity}} levels of Mallorcan midwife toad tadpoles, Alytes muletensis, were compared in two natural torrent pools which differed {{in their use}} by predatory <b>viperine</b> <b>snakes,</b> Natrix maura. Activity levels were lower in a pool regularly used by snakes {{than they were in}} a snake-free pool, but were reduced in both pools when snakes were experimentally introduced in nylon bags. In the presence of snakes, however, activity was more suppressed in the pool that was usually snake-free. Corresponding reductions in activity were also observed when tadpoles were treated with chemical cues from Mallorcan N. maura in a gravitational flow-through system. However, tadpoles failed to respond to chemical cues from other species of amphibian-eating snakes, or even to those from N. maura collected from a different population in mainland Spain. As none of the snakes used had previously eaten midwife toads, the responses cannot be related to previous diet, and seem to be specific to those N. maura from the island of Mallorca. As <b>viperine</b> <b>snakes</b> were probably introduced to Mallorca about 2000 years ago, the evolution of anti-predator behaviour in midwife toad tadpoles must have occurred relatively recently...|$|R

25|$|In vipers, the pit organ is {{seen only}} in the {{subfamily}} Crotalinae: the pitvipers. The organ is used extensively by them to detect and target warm-blooded prey such as rodents and birds, and it was previously assumed that the organ evolved specifically for that purpose. However, recent evidence shows that the pit organ may {{also be used for}} thermoregulation. In an experiment that tested snakes' abilities to locate a cool thermal refuge in an uncomfortably hot maze, all pitvipers were able to locate the refuge quickly and easily, while true vipers were unable to do so. This suggests that the pitvipers were using their pit organs to aid in thermoregulatory decisions. It is also possible that the organ may even have evolved as a defensive adaptation rather than a predatory one, or that multiple pressures may have potentially contributed to the organ's development. The use of the heat pit to direct thermoregulation in pythons and boas has not yet been determined. <b>Viperine</b> <b>snakes</b> (which lack pit organs) also use thermal cues to guide strike behavior, but not to guide thermoregulation.|$|R
40|$|Introduced {{species have}} contributed {{significantly}} to the extinction of endemic species on islands. They also create new selection pressures on their prey that may result in modified life history strategies. Introduced <b>viperine</b> <b>snakes</b> (Natrix maura) have been implicated in the decline of the endemic midwife toad of Mallorca (Alytes muletensis). A comparison of A. muletensis tadpoles in natural pools with and without snakes showed that those populations subject to snake predation possessed longer tails with narrower tail fins but deeper tail muscles. Field and laboratory experiments showed that these changes in tail morphology could be induced by chemical and tactile cues from snakes. Populations of tadpoles that were subject to snake predation also displayed clear bimodal size-frequency distributions, with intermediate-sized tadpoles missing from the pools completely. Tadpoles in pools frequented by snakes developed faster in relation to their body size than those in pools without snakes. Variation in morphology between toad populations may therefore be caused by a combination of size-selective predation and tadpole plasticity. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the introduction of alien species can result in selection for induced defences, which may facilitate coexistence between predator and prey under certain conditions...|$|R

Patients who had findings of AIN on renal histology were included for this study. Of a total of 42 patients, there were five patients (11. 9 %) with AIN. Our series of five patients is the largest series of this rare presentation in the literature. All of these five patients had features of severe envenomation, severe AKI network stage of AKI and very high antivenom requirements.

40|$|In Switzerland {{all eight}} snake species are {{threatened}} {{and have been}} added to the Swiss Red List with dif- ferent levels of concern. The most threatened is the <b>viperine</b> <b>snake,</b> Natrix maura, a semi-aquatic snake, which is considered as “Critically Endangered” (CR) in Switzerland. Only one population is presently living on the shores of Lake Geneva, mainly located between St-Saphorin and Treytorrens (Canton Vaud). But the population size estima- tion trends show a drastic reduction of this species. Alteration of the lake shore structure and the introduction of the ecologically very similar dice snake, Natrix tessellata, since the 1920 s could be the causes of the observed decline of the <b>viperine</b> <b>snake</b> in the last 15 years. A higher fecundity and a larger body size render the alien species probably more competitive and possibly have a key role on the population decrease of the native species. In order to test the hypothesis of competition between both species, their habitats between St-Saphorin and Treytorrens were described in detail in order to detect differential interspecific use. In total 23 environmental variables were measured at the study area and data were subsequently analysed using tests of proportion. Results indicate that the dice snake prefers slopes with limited vegetation height (0. 5 – 1 m), but inhabits also slopes with light vegetation cover and relatively nar- row littoral zones. In contrast, the habitat use of the <b>viperine</b> <b>snake</b> relates to littoral zones with less steep slopes, but abundant vegetation. In addition, wide littoral zones seem to be preferred by the native species, such as the region near Treytorrens where the <b>viperine</b> <b>snake</b> was observed to be most numerous. Results obtained in this study were used to suggest particular shore management action, in particular to promote the native species...|$|E
40|$|The <b>viperine</b> <b>snake</b> (Natrix maura) is an {{important}} agent of decline of the threatened midwife toad (Alytes muletensis) of Mallorca. However, there is a paucity of biological data to {{support the notion that}} the <b>viperine</b> <b>snake</b> is an introduced species to the island. Here we compare mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences and genomic ISSR-PCR fingerprints from Mallorcan and mainland European viperine snakes. Identical or nearly identical haplotypes and very similar ISSR-PCR profiles provide strong evidence that N. maura arrived only recently to Mallorca. There is no indication of a recent natural colonization of the island by transmarine dispersal. The data therefore support historical information that N. maura was introduced to Mallorca by human agency comparatively recently, and that management measures to reduce the impact of the snake on toad populations are justified...|$|E

Local, dramatic declines in the <b>viperine</b> <b>snake</b> population might {{be associated with the}} appearance of the dice snake through dietary overlap between these 2 species, which mainly feed on bullhead (Cottus gobio). In response to this decline, a control program for dice snake was implemented in 2007 to reduce numbers of this introduced snake. In 2010, a new species of fish, the freshwater blenny (Salaria fluviatilis), which shares the same habitat as the bullhead, was introduced into Lake Geneva and has since reached high densities. We determined the impact of freshwater blenny on diet composition and body condition of dice snakes. In addition, we tested for effects of the control program on the body condition of dice snakes and viperine snakes. We collected 294 dice snakes between 2007 and 2013. Based on morphology and a genetic marker (cytochrome b gene), we determined the ®sh species contained in these snakes' stomachs. We found a drastic switch in dice snake diet following the arrival of freshwater blenny, as consumption of bullhead declined by 68 % and was replaced by the blenny. In addition, the body condition of dice snakes increased significantly after the arrival of freshwater blenny. The body condition of both snake species was positively correlated with the number of dice snakes removed from the study area. This finding has important implications concerning the conservation of the endangered <b>viperine</b> <b>snake,</b> and suggests that the control program of dice snakes should be continued...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{molecular}} phylogeography of the <b>viperine</b> <b>snake,</b> Natrix maura (Linnaeus, 1758), {{was investigated}} using complete sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and genomic ISSR-PCR fingerprinting. In {{a total of}} 120 samples, 44 unique cytochrome b haplotypes were found which defined three major genetic lineages associated with samples from Morocco, Tunisia and Europe, respectively. The same lineages were supported by nuclear data. A possible fourth lineage exists in southern Spain. Genetic distances of cytochrome b sequences between the three main lineages were {{in the range of}} 3. 9 – 5. 6 %, suggesting independent evolution since the early Pliocene. Distinction of the three major lineages at the subspecies or species level is discussed to account taxonomically for the high intraspecific variation in the <b>viperine</b> <b>snake.</b> A more detailed analysis of the European samples based on genetic diversity indices and a network reconstruction suggests a complex Pleistocene history for the <b>viperine</b> <b>snake</b> in Europe. Clear differentiation was found between populations south and north of the central Iberian mountain ranges, suggesting Pleistocene glacial refugia both in the southern and northern Iberian peninsula. In the south, genetic diversity was associated with the main river valleys, whereas northern haplotypes were more broadly distributed, indicating gene flow or postglacial range expansions. Unexpectedly high levels of genetic variation in southeastern France and northwestern Italy would be compatible with the hypothesis of a glacial refugium north of the Pyrenees or in Italy. However, due to the dependence of N. maura on warm climates, the assumption of a northern refugium seems unwarranted. We believe that further sampling in northern Spain is likely to reveal genetically diverse populations which could have served as sources for postglacial recolonization of France and Italy...|$|E
30|$|Abiotic {{environmental}} {{parameters are}} known to have an important, but limited power in determining reptile distributions on a larger scale; other factors such as resources are also important (Guisan and Hofer [2003]). As far as feeding spectra are concerned, the dice snake was considered to be in an intermediate position among the three Natrix species inhabiting the Palearctic. In a comparative study with the closely related grass snake (Natrix natrix), Luiselli and Rugiero ([1991]) found the dice snake to have a narrower feeding spectrum than the grass snake, which also has a broader distribution (Gasc et al. [1997]). The latter species more plastically changing its diet and populations near to each other within relatively short distances may specialise on different food (Luiselli et al. [2005]). What is more, the presence of the dice snake did not have any apparent effect on the food types eaten by grass snakes because grass snakes consumed fish when sympatric with N. tessellata (Luiselli et al. [2005]). The diet of the third species, the <b>viperine</b> <b>snake,</b> Natrix maura, shows a considerable overlap with that of the dice snake but with some exceptions (see e.g. the observations of Scali, [2011]), and due to other factors as fertility and size, the dice snake is able to outcompete the <b>viperine</b> <b>snake</b> (Metzger et al.

The decline of the species has been attributed to the impacts of introduced species such as the <b>viperine</b> <b>snake</b> (Natrix maura) and green frog (Rana perezi), and toads may be surviving only in areas that are suboptimal for these predators. The influence of landscape features (elevation, aspect and maximum slope) on the distribution of toads and associated predators was therefore investigated using GIS. The presence of toads was positively associated with steep slopes. At sites where they occurred with toads, the distribution of predators was negatively associated with elevation. Reproductive success within toad populations was strongly associated with the number of pools at each site, while reproductive success within individual pools was positively associated with elevation. These findings may be used to optimise the design and location of future reintroduction sites. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Food {{availability}} induces geographic {{variation in}} reproductive timing of an aquatic oviparous snake (Natrix maura) X. Santos 1, 2, G. A. Llorente 1, M. Feriche 2, J. M. Pleguezuelos 2, F. Casals 3, A. de Sostoa 1 Abstract. The <b>viperine</b> <b>snake</b> Natrix maura {{is a common}} water snake, which forages on aquatic prey such as fish and frogs in Western Mediterranean water bodies. Female viperine snakes collected from three populations at the Iberian Peninsula during the vitellogenesis period were compared. Mean clutch size and range, {{as well as the}} slope of the regression between body size and clutch size, did not show differences between populations. In contrast, mean size of enlarged follicles of females collected in May from the Ebro Delta proved significantly smaller than those of females from the Matarranya River (50 km far) and the Granada Depression (500 km far). There were no differences in climatic conditions between areas. However, seasonal variation in food availability was significantly different in the Ebro Delta. In this area, the rice fields are dry in early spring as men control the water flow, and prey are not available. This energetic constraint induced female viperine snakes to adjust reproductive timing according to seasonal availability and to delay vitellogenesis for at least one month. By contrast, other Mediterranean populations exhibited a rather high prey availability from early spring (e. g. Matarranya River), females being in good condition in this season and consequently vitellogenesis starting earlier than in the Ebro Delta. This study illustrates a new case of reproductive plasticity in snakes...|$|E
40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{characteristics of}} hemorrhagic metalloproteinases isolated from snake venoms are reviewed, {{together with their}} role in the pathogenesis of the local tissue damage characteristic of crotaline and <b>viperine</b> <b>snake</b> envenomations. Venom metalloproteinases differ in their domain structure. Some enzymes comprise only the metalloproteinase domain, others have disintegrin-like and high cysteine domains and others present, besides these domains, an additional lectin-like subunit. All of them are zinc-dependent enzymes with highly similar zinc binding environments. Some metalloproteinases induce hemorrhage by directly affecting mostly capillary blood vessels. It is suggested that hemorrhagic enzymes cleave, in a highly selective fashion, key peptide bonds of basement membrane components, thereby affecting the interaction between basement membrane and endothelial cells. As a consequence, these cells undergo a series of morphological and functional alterations in vivo, probably associated with biophysical hemodynamic factors such as tangential fluid shear stress. Eventually, gaps are formed in endothelial cells through which extravasation occurs. In addition to hemorrhage, venom metalloproteinases induce skeletal muscle damage, myonecrosis, which seems to be secondary to the ischemia that ensues in muscle tissue as a consequence of bleeding and reduced perfusion. Microvessel disruption by metalloproteinases also impairs skeletal muscle regeneration, being therefore responsible of fibrosis and permanent tissue loss after snakebites. Moreover, venom metalloproteinases participate in the degradation of extracellular matrix components and play a relevant role in the prominent local inflammatory response that characterizes snakebite envenomations, since they induce edema, activate endogenous matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and are capable of releasing TNF-α from its membrane-bound precursor. Owing to their protagonic role in the pathogenesis of local tissue damage, snake venom metalloproteinases constitute relevant targets for natural and synthetic inhibitors which may complement antivenoms in the neutralization of these effects.

40|$|The Ebro Delta is a wetland area {{in which}} natural {{ecosystems}} have been partially replaced by rice fields. This mixed and productive landscape has allowed {{the establishment of a}} rich community of organisms. The <b>viperine</b> <b>snake</b> Natrix maura has traditionally been a common and abundant predator because the habitat is favorable and prey availability is high. In June 1995, we conducted a demographic study to evaluate relative densities of snakes in the rice fields. Thirteen years later, we repeated the same study in the same area and season. The field work consisted of 29 censuses of one hectare each, and snakes and their potential prey (green frogs and fish) were counted. In 1995, we found 27 snakes (0. 93 animals/ha), these occupying 48 % of the sites. Frogs and fish were observed in 23 of the 29 censuses (79 %). In 2008, no snakes were found and frogs and fish appeared in only 11 of the samples (38 %). In 2008, we also prospected 20 sites in rice fields located next to the natural lagoons. At these sites, we detected a greater number of snakes (25 % of the stations). Several factors can explain the clear decline of the N. maura population in the Ebro Delta rice fields: 1) the transformation and degradation of the habitat; 2) the increase in population densities of natural predators such as herons; 3) the decrease in prey availability; 4) the massive use of pollutants in the rice fields; and 5) snake death on local roads and directly by human persecution. We propose that a combined effect of these factors has caused the alarming decline of this predator. The observation of water snakes in rice fields near natural lagoons indicates that protected natural areas act as natural refuges for fauna with reduced mobility, such as viperine snakes. The recovery of the N. maura population in the rice fields of the Ebro Delta depends on an integral change in agricultural management, including the reduced use of pollutants, the recovery of snake prey, and the maintenance of favorable habitats to prevent predation...|$|E
