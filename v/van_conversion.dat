50|$|Another {{method of}} {{building}} a minibus is for a second stage manufacturer to build a specific body for fitting to a semi-completed van or light truck chassis. These allow a higher seating capacity than a simple <b>van</b> <b>conversion.</b> Often, the second stage manufacturer is a bus manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|This term is not {{commonly}} used except for imported North American models, which may vary greatly {{in size from}} semi-low profile coachbuilts to <b>van</b> <b>conversions.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In a side note, Travco {{also offered}} <b>van</b> <b>conversions</b> called [...] "Family Wagons" [...] {{as well as}} class C Minihomes called [...] "Family Wagon", with {{aluminum}} sides similar to Winniebago's [...] "Minnie winnie", and a fiberglass version called [...] "L'Esprit".|$|R
50|$|Busette, {{developed}} by Wayne Corporation in 1972, {{was the first}} successful small school bus {{to be based on}} a cutaway van chassis with dual rear wheels. With a low center of gravity and the dual rear wheels, Busette provided an exceptional combination of increased seating capacity and handling stability over conventional <b>vans</b> and <b>van</b> <b>conversions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Elkhart {{is home to}} many Recreational vehicle (RV) manufacturers, boat manufacturers, and <b>van</b> <b>conversion</b> companies, {{including}} Bennington Marine, Forest River Inc Hy-Line, Keystone, Skyline, Sun Valley, Travel Supreme, Thor Motor Coach, {{and many}} other manufacturers, including Gulf Stream, and Jayco, can be found nearby in Goshen, Middlebury, Nappanee and Wakarusa.|$|E
50|$|The {{most basic}} source of minibus is the <b>van</b> <b>conversion,</b> where the minibus is derived by modifying an {{existing}} van design. Conversions may be produced completely by the van manufacturer, sold {{as part of}} their standard model line-up, or be produced by specialist conversion companies, who source a suitably prepared base model from the van manufacturer for final completion as a minibus.|$|E
5000|$|Sportsmobile is {{a company}} that {{provides}} custom after market conversions for full size vans. Most vans are fully converted to type B RV motor-homes. The Sportsmobile company was founded in 1961 by Charles Borskey [...] and now has three locations: Huntington, Indiana, Austin, Texas and Fresno, California. They are considered one of the oldest <b>van</b> <b>conversion</b> companies in the U.S.|$|E
50|$|Vehicles are sixteen-passenger <b>van</b> <b>conversions</b> {{equipped}} with wheelchair lifts and tiedowns. Twelve of the sixteen seats are collapsible, allowing space {{for up to}} 4 wheelchairs. Fares are $4.50 each way, though passengers are allowed to bring one companion (as a PCA, or Personal Care Assistant) free of charge. Additional fare-paying companions are also permitted.|$|R
5000|$|Initial {{production}} included models {{based upon}} Ford Econoline chassis; {{the company was}} also one of the few to build bus bodies on the Dodge Ram Van chassis. Today, along with the Ford E-Series, <b>van</b> <b>conversions</b> are done on the Chevrolet Express/GMC Savana cutaway chassis. Van Con specializes in manufacturing handicap-accessible buses with wheelchair lifts as an option.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from these}} factory variants, {{there were a}} {{multitude}} of third-party conversions available, {{some of which were}} offered through Volkswagen dealers. They included, but were not limited to, refrigerated vans, hearses, ambulances, police vans, fire engines and ladder trucks, and camping <b>van</b> <b>conversions</b> by companies other than Westfalia. There were even 30 Klv 20 rail-going draisines built for Deutsche Bundesbahn in 1955.|$|R
50|$|Van {{conversions}} involve adding {{windows to}} the bodywork, and seating to the cargo area. <b>Van</b> <b>conversion</b> minibuses outwardly {{look the same}} shape as the parent van, and the driver and front passenger cabin remains unchanged, retaining the driver and passenger doors. Access to the former cargo area for passengers is through the standard van side sliding door, or the rear doors. These may be fitted with step equipment to make boarding easier. Optional extras to van converted minibuses can include {{the addition of a}} rollsign for transit work, and/or a full-height walk-in door, for passenger access to the former cargo area. For public transport use, this door may be an automatic concertina type. For other uses, this may be a simple plug style coach door. Depending on the relevant legislation, conversions may also involve wheelchair lifts and tachograph equipment. A <b>van</b> <b>conversion</b> with a passenger area in the front and a storage area in the back, behind a fixed bulkhead, is called a splitter bus.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, a {{management}} buyout occurred and Westfalia <b>Van</b> <b>Conversion</b> {{is now an}} independent entity. It still converts some vehicles for major car manufacturers to sell through their own networks, such as the Ford Nugget, but also markets conversions through its own network of recreational vehicle dealers. These models include the Ford-based Big Nugget, Volkswagen-based Sven Hedin and the Michelangelo. The Michelangelo vehicle uses a Fiat Scudo chassis and {{is designed to be}} a major competitor to the Volkswagen California.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, DaimlerChrysler {{purchased}} a 49% stake in Westfalia-Werke's <b>van</b> <b>conversion</b> division, and in 2001 absorbed the remaining 51%. Of course, since DaimlerChrysler is a Volkswagen competitor, this spelled {{the end of}} the Volkswagen-Westfalia partnership. While Volkswagen still offers pop-top camper conversions in Europe, they now do have another supplier to do the conversions. Meanwhile, Westfalia now makes high-roof — rather than pop-top — factory camper conversions for Mercedes vans, distributed in the United States by Airstream and badged as Dodge Sprinters. They also provide automotive accessories to BMW, including trailer hitches.|$|E
50|$|Aside from Otosan's {{plant in}} Turkey, {{production}} now also {{takes place at}} Valencia, Spain. As before, to avoid the 25% tariff on imported trucks, all cargo vans sold in the United States will be passenger <b>van</b> <b>conversions</b> which will then be re-converted to cargo configuration upon customer demand. Reports have been publishedthat US Customs told Ford that they must stop this practice.|$|R
50|$|The Wayne Busette was {{the first}} small school bus {{designed}} on a cutaway van chassis. A product of Wayne Corporation of Richmond, Indiana, first developed in 1972, the Busette utilized a van chassis equipped with dual rear wheels. With a low center of gravity, Busette provided the combination of increased seating capacity and handling stability over a Chevy Suburban, conventional <b>vans,</b> and <b>van</b> <b>conversions.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Conversion</b> <b>vans</b> are {{originally}} bare, windowless full-size 1/2 ton or 3/4 ton cargo vans {{such as the}} Chevrolet Express/GMC Savana, the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, Ram ProMaster Van, and the full-size Ford Transit. Recently, the Ford Transit Connect {{has been}} the subject of conversions. The microvan offers a vehicle with improved gas mileage and marks the first time since companies ceased conversions of Chrysler minivans that a car-based van has been used in <b>conversions.</b> The <b>Conversion</b> <b>Van</b> Marketing Association (CVMA) is a partnership between General Motors and seven <b>conversion</b> <b>van</b> manufacturers. Exclusive partnership means members of the CVMA are the only manufacturers authorized by GM to build Chevrolet or GMC <b>conversion</b> <b>vans.</b>|$|R
50|$|Starting in {{the late}} sixties, the campervans were {{converted}} in a lockup garage at Clapham Common in London.The company began as is the way with many camper <b>van</b> <b>conversion</b> companies from a love of VWs and travelling. Richard and Heather would return from a holiday in Australia and decided that they needed a campervan to explore the UK and Europe in. They carried out a conversion with Richard constructing the furniture and his wife Heather working on finishing {{the interior of the}} vehicles including Upholstery and soft furnishings such as curtains.|$|E
50|$|From 1977 to 1980 IH {{contracted}} with Midas <b>Van</b> <b>Conversion</b> Co. of Elkhart, Indiana, to build special luxury models {{to be offered}} through its dealers. These vehicles had swivel bucket seats, shag carpet, color keyed interiors, door panels, headliner, grille guards, dual sunroofs, overhead clocks, 3rd seat, reading lights, tinted windows, fender flares, and special side appliques and paint designs. Models included the Family Cruiser (or just Cruiser), the Street Machine, and Off-Road Vehicle. Another company called Van American (Goshen, Indiana) offered similar options to compete with Midas; however these vehicles were only offered for a short time, making them very rare today. See one here.|$|E
50|$|There are van {{conversions}} with accommodations on {{all parts}} of the spectrum. It {{can be as simple as}} a folding bed in the back, with only the engine battery for power; ranging to vans that have function like micro-apartments on wheels; with complex power setups, kitchenette, and even primitive plumbing. For the simple end vehicles like the Volkswagen Westfalia, factory van conversions, an owner modified regular passenger van, or a cargo van, which can easily be modified for day to day living by a professional conversion company. Complex <b>van</b> <b>conversion</b> have most of the amenities of a conventional home; including heating, AC unit, house battery systems, 2 burner stove, permanent bed, and other modifications that make the vehicle fit for full-time living.|$|E
50|$|Another {{market in}} which Sprinters are gaining ground is as <b>van</b> <b>conversions</b> and {{recreational}} vehicles. Conversions include RV's, limousines, family and luxury vans, office vans, wheelchair accessible vans and golf <b>vans.</b> Sprinter RV <b>conversions</b> {{can also be}} called Sprinter campervans. Sprinter conversions have been produced by several RV and coach manufacturers. Chilled box versions of the Sprinter currently make {{up the majority of}} the supermarket Home Delivery fleet across the UK, but demand for these vans has begun to decline. ASDA recently announced that its new fleet would be primarily custom IVECO vans, {{following in the footsteps of}} Tesco. Mercedes are currently working with Waitrose Home Delivery, who currently use chilled LWB HR Sprinters, on a prototype of a new generation home-delivery van, which is currently being used in select stores, aiming to cut emissions, costs and increase time-efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Although less popular, Mercedes also {{manufactured}} a similar-sized light <b>van</b> and <b>conversions</b> were reasonably {{common in}} the 1960s and '70s. Of a similar size and vintage is the British Commer Spacevan conversion.|$|R
50|$|The new-generation Econoline {{would become}} common {{not only in}} its own right, but {{as the basis for}} other vehicles. With a full frame, the Econoline became popular as a cutaway van chassis; the design served as a basis for many ambulances, and various types of trucks and buses. The shared {{drivetrain}} with the F-Series marked the beginning of aftermarket four-wheel drive conversions. During the 1970s, the Econoline became popular as a basis for <b>van</b> <b>conversions.</b> Using the sparsely-equipped Econoline cargo van as a basis, a luxurious interior was fitted, along with extensive customization of the exterior.|$|R
5000|$|The Holdsworth Motorhomes Company was a UK-based camper <b>van</b> <b>conversion</b> company {{running from}} 1968 to the mid-1990s that {{was run by}} Richard Holdsworth It was of {{importance}} in the UK for {{being one of the}} first campervan conversion companies and went on to be highly successful with the motor industry having contracts in place with British Leyland who gave their full approval for the conversion of their Sherpa vans into campervans and due to the quality of their conversions they were also popular with the public. The Holdsworth company was {{the first of its kind}} in the UK to gain approval from Volkswagen. Before Holdsworth campervan conversion outside of Germany was a cottage industry but the companies success turned conversions into a profitable business and the model was adopted by a number of other companies. Holdsworth success continued through the 80s but in the 90s the company ran into increasing financial difficulty and after one deal left the business with a surplus of stock the company ceased trading. [...] The company would become Cockburn Holdsworth but this venture was short lived and it would shortly cease trading as a camper van manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|After the mid 80s, luxurious {{interiors}} featuring thickly padded seats, {{wood trim}} and luxury lighting {{began to appear}} in conversion vans as families and retirees started using them for road trips and camping. At the same time, both the federal government and vehicle manufacturers began efforts to exert some degree of control on the <b>van</b> <b>conversion</b> industry, demanding that certain safety guidelines be adhered to. The price of conversion vans also started to increase as things such as sleeping accommodations, cooking utilities, televisions and other items were added to the conversion vans. The higher pricing and smaller market segment meant a resulting decrease in sales. Also, DVD and flat screen technology meant that many automobiles now have features once exclusive to conversion vans. At the same time, the price of gas was also increasing, leading still more people away from these large cargo vans, whose V-8 engines and poor aerodynamics resulted in poor gas mileage. Finally, the growing demand for minivans and SUVs siphoned off even more potential customers. Despite these setbacks though, as the economy boomed in the 1990s, conversion vans sales began to improve, with almost 200,000 units sold in 1994 alone. As of 2007, about 20,000 conversion vans are being sold each year, with most being sold for family transport.|$|E
40|$|Formal {{optimisation}} {{studies of}} the aerodynamic design of Emergency Response Vehicles, typically encountered within the United Kingdom, were undertaken. The objectives {{of the study were}} to optimise the aerodynamics of the Emergency Response Vehicles such as Ambulance and Police cars, in terms of drag force. A combination of wind tunnel tests and the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to analyse the flow field and aerodynamic characteristics of Emergency Response Vehicles. The experimental data were used to validate the computer simulations and the good agreement observed gave confidence in the results obtained. Results from computer simulations on the scale models and full-scale models, were also characteristically {{similar to those of the}} validated scale model. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was combined with an efficient optimisation framework to minimize the drag force of three different types of Emergency Response Vehicles, Ambulance <b>Van</b> <b>Conversion,</b> Police <b>Van</b> <b>Conversion</b> and Police Sedan car Conversion. The benefits of employing an airfoil-based roof design and Bezier curve fitting approach which minimizes the deleterious aerodynamic effects of the required front and rear light-bars, were investigated. Optimal Latin Hypercube (OLH) Design of Experiments, the Multipoint Approximation Method (MAM) and surrogate modelling were used for the optimisation. Optimisation results demonstrated a clear improvement of the aerodynamic design of the Emergency Response Vehicles named above. It was also clearly demonstrated that improving the aerodynamic design of Emergency Response Vehicles roof offers a significant opportunity for reducing the fuel consumption and emissions for Emergency Response Vehicles. ...|$|E

5000|$|More {{expensive}} splitters commonly {{come with}} entertainment packages {{in the passenger}} area that may include DVD players, games consoles, CD stereos and MP3 Player docks, mobile internet access. Splitter buses are not produced in the factory by vehicle manufacturers, but rather, they are built by specialist coach builders. Since 2011 {{it has been a}} legal requirement in the UK {{and the rest of the}} EU to have all new splitter <b>van</b> <b>conversions</b> (whether on second hand vehicles or brand new) tested for safety by the relevant vehicle standards agency through the IVA system. All components used in the build must meet strict EU safety requirements.|$|R
40|$|ATRS) [1] {{represents}} {{an alternative to}} <b>van</b> <b>conversions</b> for automobile drivers with lower body disabilities. The core of ATRS is a “smart ” wheelchair that navigates between the driver’s position and a powered lift {{at the rear of}} the vehicle. From an automation perspective, autonomously docking the wheelchair onto the lift platform was the most significant technical challenge due to its geometry constraints. This work investigates the use of a LIDAR-based localization scheme to meet these requirements. Testing was conducted at the component and system level. Results indicate the proposed approach is both accurate and robust under benign and degraded visibility conditions. We expect ATRS to enter the market in late 2007. I...|$|R
50|$|In 1971, ChevyVan {{received}} a major redesign, moving the engine {{forward of the}} driver with a short nose and hood. The van was constructed of a unibody style frame and employed stronger truck style hubs and brakes with dual A-Arm independent front suspension. The major restyle followed the engine-forward design of the competing 1968 Ford Econoline. Suspension and steering parts came from the Chevrolet C/K. GMC now marketed their vans under the VanDura name. These models between 78 and 95 were popular with <b>Van</b> <b>conversions</b> such as Curtis and Starcraft. In addition to the cab-chassis models, there were also factory cube vans from Chevy and GMC, called the Chevy High-Cube or Hi-Cube, and GMC MagnaVan.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>conversion</b> <b>van</b> is a {{full-sized}} cargo van that {{is sent to}} third-party {{companies to}} be outfitted with various luxuries for road trips and camping. It can also mean a full-size passenger van in which the rear seating have been rearranged for taxis, school buses, shuttle buses, and limo purposes {{in place of a}} family <b>van.</b> Other <b>conversions</b> include bespoke fitting services to be undertaken to make the load area of light commercial vehicles suitable for industrial work. This includes various things such as racking systems for the storage of tools and goods so they can be kept safe and utilise the full storage capability of the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|The styling {{was a major}} {{advance on}} the earlier van-based conversions, having a raked front with large {{windscreen}} and side windows to give a light interior. With shallower steps, wider entrance, and generous headroom, the passenger environment was certainly a great improvement on what had come before, with up to 25 (or 33 in the long version) seats comfortably accommodated. However, although the structure appeared to be of a heavyweight construction, long versions soon suffered weaknesses in the extended rear overhang and, in time, major corrosion set in, resulting in a life not quite as lengthy as might have initially been expected. The long-wheelbase version of the Metrorider measures 8.4m or 27' 6" [...] in length, while the wide body was built to 2.375m or 7' 9½" [...] wide, significantly broader than <b>van</b> <b>conversions,</b> allowing wider seats and/or gangway.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Conversion</b> <b>vans</b> {{came into}} style during the 1970s and 1980s. Early <b>conversions</b> were simply <b>vans</b> with seats put in them, often with murals painted along the sides.|$|R
5000|$|Westfalia-Werke also {{converted}} non-Volkswagen vans, {{and produced}} trailers and other products, {{but they were}} best known for their Volkswagen camper conversions. Westfalia began converting Volkswagen buses in 1951. Their famous [...] "pop-top" [...] package was added later, and became very popular on the second-generation VW Bus from 1968 to 1979, its successor the Vanagon, the Sven Hedin and Florida conversions on the Volkswagen LT, and then the T4 EuroVan, which was discontinued in 2003. This design also inspired many imitators, with dozens of other companies worldwide offering pop-top <b>van</b> <b>conversions.</b> Therefore, not all pop-top Volkswagens are Westfalia conversions, although in the United States, the Westfalia conversion {{was by far the}} most common. Conversely, not all Volkswagen Westfalia conversions had pop-tops or cooking facilities. Volkswagen offered a [...] "Weekender" [...] package in the 1970s with a Westfalia interior, but no pop-top. Later, some Vanagon conversions were offered with a pop-top and interior table, but lacked cooking facilities and instead included a luggable 12 volt refrigerator.|$|R
5000|$|Companies are {{replacing}} <b>van</b> <b>conversions</b> {{with wide}} bus bodies—Sprinters with side-facing benches and tall right-side doors—as campus shuttles. Limited numbers of complete [...] "wagons" [...] (passenger vans) are being produced in Germany and shipped complete to the United States mostly for personal and church van uses. Typical Sprinter Wagons accommodate 8 to 10 passengers and have glass in all possible factory positions. Vans {{shipped to the}} United States on-spec (speculation to sell by dealer/distributor) are mostly sent in Arctic White color, but many colors are available. The Dodge dealer network for Sprinters is limited to certified locations (known as [...] "Business Link" [...] certified dealers, usually only awarded to [...] "Five Star" [...] certified dealers), and dealer knowledge is still limited in both sales and service. Special orders typically take one to three months for delivery, and may take even longer due to the assembly and dis-assembly in Germany, and exporting parts to South Carolina for re-assembly. The exception is passenger van models which are assembled in Germany and exported as complete vehicles.|$|R
