So it is a 1920s vibe, it's black and white, very high fashion—you know, you'll see me very dapper in 1920s, Frank Sinatra-ish. So you'll see the cars from that era, you'll {{definitely}} feel the vibe of the house having that 1920s vibe as well. So it's very different and <b>very</b> <b>intimate,</b> and it's not a lot of dancing—it's more personal.|$|E
25|$|During the 3rd {{millennium}} BC, there {{developed a}} <b>very</b> <b>intimate</b> cultural symbiosis between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread bilingualism.

25|$|Rahel Levin {{was born}} in Berlin to a Jewish family. Her father, a wealthy jeweler, was a strong-willed man who ruled his family despotically. She became <b>very</b> <b>intimate</b> with Dorothea and Henriette, {{the daughters of the}} philosopher Moses Mendelssohn. Together with them she knew Henriette Herz, with whom she later became most intimately associated, moving in the same {{intellectual}} sphere. She, Henriette Herz, and Levin's cousin Sara Grotthuis née Meyer hosted the most noted Berlin salons around 1800. Her home became the meeting-place of men like Schlegel, Schelling, Steffens, Schack, Schleiermacher, Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt, Motte Fouqué, Baron Brückmann, Ludwig Tieck, Jean Paul, and Friedrich Gentz. During a visit to Carlsbad in 1795 she was introduced to Goethe, whom she again saw in 1815, at Frankfurt am Main.|$|E
25|$|A {{member of}} the loline {{alkaloids}} was first isolated from the grass Lolium temulentum and its elemental composition determined in 1892. It was initially named temuline and later renamed norloline. (Reviewed by Schardl et al. (2007).) Studies in the 1950s and 1960s by Russian researchers established the name loline and identified the characteristic 2,7 ether bridge in its molecular structure. Since then the analytical methods for purification {{and analysis of the}} lolines have been refined and several different loline species have been identified in many Lolium and related grasses infected by the Epichloë/Neotyphodium (epichloae) endophytes. Lolines are absent in grass plants that do not harbor the epichloae endophytes, and not all epichloae produce the lolines. Because of the <b>very</b> <b>intimate</b> association of plant and endophyte and difficulties to reproduce the symbiotic conditions in vitro, it was long unknown if the fungus was the producer of the lolines, or if they were synthesized by the plant in response to endophyte infection. In 2001, it was demonstrated that the endophyte Neotyphodium uncinatum produces lolines in some chemically defined growth media, which suggests that the endophyte is also the producer of the lolines in the grass plant. The lolines have also been reported from some plants in several plant families, suggesting a more widespread occurrence of these compounds in nature.|$|E
25|$|In November 1816 a {{convention}} {{founded on the}} treaty of Paris was signed between England and the Netherlands, empowering Wellington to dispose of a fund of six millions {{and a half in}} constructing defensive works {{for the protection of the}} Netherlands, and to delegate his powers to as many inspectors as he pleased. The duke named Jones to be sole inspector, and persevered in this choice in spite of strong pressure on behalf of a superior officer. Jones's duty was to make periodical inspections of each fortress, to superintend the execution of the approved plans, sanction modifications, and check expenditure. Wellington generally made two inspections of some weeks annually, when he was always attended by Jones alone, and became <b>very</b> <b>intimate</b> with him. On the return to England of the army of occupation, Jones, who became a regimental lieutenant-colonel on 11 November 1816, was appointed to the command of the royal engineers and royal sappers and miners at Woolwich, and to the charge of the powder factories, while still acting as inspector in the Netherlands. In 1823 Jones was sent by Wellington to the Ionian Islands to confer with the high commissioner, Sir Thomas Maitland, respecting the defences of Corfu. His plans were approved and gradually carried out. On 27 May 1825 Jones was appointed aide-de-camp to the king, with the rank of colonel in the army. On 19 August 1830 Wellington sent him on a special mission to the Netherlands with a view to any military arrangements advisable on account of the recent revolution in France. At Ghent Jones heard of the rising in Brussels, went to the king of the Netherlands at the Hague, and at the king's request joined the Dutch army and the Prince of Orange at Antwerp. By his advice the prince went to Brussels, where he had a good military position and sufficient force to maintain himself. Two hours after Jones had left Brussels for London to report on his mission the prince retired to the Hague, thus abandoning his advantages and determining the subsequent course of the revolution. On 30 September 1831 Jones was created a baronet for his services in the Netherlands. In congratulating him upon the honour conferred on him, Wellington suggested a castle with the word ‘Netherlands’ as an addition to his armorial bearings. From 1835 to 1838 Jones's health compelled him to live in a southern climate. He was promoted major-general John Thomas Jones on 10 January 1837, and in 1838 he was made a K.C.B.|$|E

40|$|William Halsted and Theodor Kocher {{were friends}} on both a {{professional}} and personal level. They greatly admired each other's surgical skills and judgment, and Halsted was a frequent visitor to Kocher in Switzerland.

An analysis of their personal correspondence, which has not been previously published, clearly demonstrates this unique relationship between the two reknowned surgeons...|$|R

500|$|In 1937, Bence took a {{more serious}} role in Luis Saslavsky's drama La fuga, in which she {{supported}} Tita Merello and Santiago Arrieta. The performance earned Bence a contract with Olegario Ferrando at Pampa Film and three other film roles. After a long theatrical season with Luis Arata and inconsequential participation in El forastero, she filmed La vuelta al nido with José Gola. Bence defined the film as [...] "one {{of the best of}} our cinema... A simple and profound story... <b>very</b> <b>intimate,</b> full of sensitive details... it was not understood by critics or the public at the time".|$|E
500|$|The exact {{relationship}} between Fielding's The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling and Richardson's The History of Sir Charles Grandison cannot be known, but the character Charles Grandison {{was designed as}} a morally [...] "better" [...] hero than the character Tom Jones. In 1749, a friend asked Richardson [...] "to give the world his idea of a good man and fine gentleman combined". Richardson hesitated to begin such a project, and he did not work on it until he was prompted the next year (June 1750) by Mrs. Donnelland and Miss Sutton, who were [...] "both <b>very</b> <b>intimate</b> with one Clarissa Harlowe: and both extremely earnest with him to give them a good man". [...] Near the end of 1751, Richardson sent a draft of the novel to Mrs. Donnellan, and the novel was being finalised in the middle of 1752.|$|E
500|$|It {{has also}} been said that Demosthenes paid Isaeus 10,000drachmae (somewhat over 1.5talents) on the {{condition}} that Isaeus should withdraw from a school of rhetoric which he had opened, and should devote himself wholly to Demosthenes, his new pupil. Another version credits Isaeus with having taught Demosthenes without charge. According to Sir Richard C. Jebb, a British classical scholar, [...] "the intercourse between Isaeus and Demosthenes as teacher and learner can scarcely have been either <b>very</b> <b>intimate</b> or of very long duration". Konstantinos Tsatsos, a Greek professor and academician, believes that Isaeus helped Demosthenes edit his initial judicial orations against his guardians. Demosthenes is also said to have admired the historian Thucydides. In the Illiterate Book-Fancier, Lucian mentions eight beautiful copies of Thucydides made by Demosthenes, all in Demosthenes' own handwriting. These references hint at his respect for a historian he must have assiduously studied.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{initially}} planned as {{a documentary about}} Thirty Seconds to Mars' creative process while recording their next album, but upon {{the advent of the}} lawsuit, was retooled as a documentary about making that album {{in the face of a}} legal battle that might prevent it from being released. Leto described the film as [...] "a really special, DIY project." [...] He explained, [...] "We all shared a part of our lives that we've never shared on-screen before, a <b>very</b> <b>intimate</b> and personal part of our lives. We take you ... inside the studio, and in our hearts, and in our minds, to share how difficult this point is in our lives—just battling this massive corporation, and fighting for what we believe in."

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} during March 2010 – 2011 at Capitol Studios and Avatar Studios. The album's title {{comes from the}} lead track [...] "I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter", originally a hit for Fats Waller in 1935. Said McCartney in the liner notes, [...] "I worked with Diana Krall, and great jazz musicians like John Clayton. This is an album very tender, <b>very</b> <b>intimate.</b> This is an album you listen to at home after work, {{with a glass of}} wine or a cup of tea." [...] The disc was helmed by LiPuma who has previously worked with Miles Davis and Barbra Streisand, among others. The album is mostly standards, with two originals written in the same style ("My Valentine" [...] and [...] "Only Our Hearts"). [...] "My Valentine", composed by McCartney, the first song released from the album, features Eric Clapton on guitar. Stevie Wonder plays harmonica on [...] "Only Our Hearts". McCartney plays acoustic guitar on [...] "Get Yourself Another Fool" [...] and [...] "The Inch Worm", but otherwise contributes only vocals.|$|E

However, the singer was protecting the idea of the raw version, and said: [...] "This is how we wanted to be". They added two changes to the song and then {{spent the rest of the}} day recording Björk's vocals. They wanted to have only one take that really worked so that they did not have to edit different takes. They recorded 20 takes, and used the fifth or sixth, and because of that, the producer thought that [...] "this track is <b>very</b> <b>intimate</b> and personal because of the way the vocals were recorded". The way the song was recorded was [...] "kind of rough" [...] according to Knak; [...] "It's also very close to the mic; all these things that you wouldn't normally keep. In that sense, it is very kind of, almost naked. In the structure and in the feeling because of the lyrics".|$|E

He said that, like the song, the video is by turns garish and <b>very</b> <b>intimate.</b> The website's Jocelyn Vena thought that it had [...] dreamlike and surrealistic images of Rihanna, who moves through set-ups that are occasionally exceptional. E! Online's Bruna Nessif said that the video shows an abundance of elaborate imagery, narratives, and especially a [...] "mysterious and sexy" [...] Rihanna. Additionally, she found it obvious that the body of a heavily tattooed man's arm, which Rihanna clings to desperately, is a reference to Chris Brown. NME magazine observed Rihanna being shown in four environments that represent the four elements of the earth, air, water and fire. Billy Johnson Jr. of Yahoo! Canada felt the video had failed to capture the song's vivid celebration of a love affair and stated, [...] "It seems as though [...] in chaos, reflecting on happier times." [...] Marc Hogan of Spin concluded that the video was a [...] "confirmation of Rihanna's awkward segue into adult-contemporary-dom." [...] The video for [...] "Diamonds" [...] was Vevo's fourth most-viewed visual of 2013.|$|E

Both sides thought that it needed to be <b>very</b> <b>intimate,</b> but the director thought that the moment should be drawn out more while de Pablo and Michael Weatherly wanted to keep it brief. Furthermore, the latter two believed that simply looking at each other would be sufficient to convey the message to the audience. Eventually, de Pablo approached O'Hara and said, [...] "Listen, if there was any more time of staring into each other's eyes, it would be like, cut to a hotel room." [...] In an interview, she explained that she and Weatherly played the characters as being at a more vulnerable level than is typical for the show. She likened Tony to a [...] "man Teddy Bear" [...] in the episode; in the Tony-Ziva dynamic, he is normally portrayed as being the more juvenile of the two while Ziva is more mature and worldly. In [...] "Berlin", their roles are largely reversed as more of [...] "the little girl in Ziva" [...] is shown and as Tony takes charge of the situation while they are dancing. De Pablo said that she found this reversal in their interactions to be an interesting change.|$|E
