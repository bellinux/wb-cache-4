6000|$|... 'Thank {{heaven for}} a most {{fortunate}} day. At three o'clock {{this morning in}} a damp, chill mist all hands were roused to work. With a small delay, {{for one or two}} improvements I had seen to be necessary last night, the engine started and since that time I do not think there has been half an hour's stoppage. A rope to splice, a block to change, a wheel to oil, an old rusted anchor to disengage from the cable which brought it up, these have been our only obstructions. Sixty, seventy, eighty, a hundred, a hundred and twenty revolutions at last, my little engine tears away. The even black rope comes straight out of the blue heaving water: [...] passes slowly round an open-hearted, good-tempered looking pulley, five feet diameter; aft past a vicious nipper, to bring all up should anything go wrong; through a gentle guide; on to a huge bluff drum, who wraps him round his body and says [...] "Come you must," [...] as plain as drum can speak: the chattering pauls say [...] "I've got him, I've got him, he can't get back:" [...] whilst black cable, much slacker and easier in mind and body, is taken by a slim <b>V-pulley</b> and passed down into the huge hold, where half a dozen men put him comfortably to bed after his exertion in rising from his long bath. [...] In good sooth, {{it is one of the}} strangest sights I know to see that black fellow rising up so steadily in the midst of the blue sea. [...] We are more than half way to the place where we expect the fault; and already the one wire, supposed previously to be quite bad near the African coast, can be spoken through. I am very glad I am here, for my machines are my own children and I look on their little failings with a parent's eye and lead them into the path of duty with gentleness and firmness. I am naturally in good spirits, but keep very quiet, for misfortunes may arise at any instant; moreover to-morrow my paying-out apparatus will be wanted should all go well, and that will be another nervous operation. Fifteen miles are safely in; but no one knows better than I do that nothing is done till all is done.|$|E

40|$|A {{revolving}} die and roller type pelletizing {{machine was}} designed and constructed to produce fish feed pellets for small scale fish farmers. The major components of the pelletizer were the hopper, rollers, a flat die, shaft, discharge tray, frame, V-belt, <b>V-pulley</b> and electric motor. These components were designed based on strength and rigidity. An electric motor drives the die by a shaft connected to its pulley. The rotation of the die initiates {{the rotation of the}} rollers which pick up the feed material and compress it into the die holes to form pellets. The pelletizing machine was tested at two speed levels of 507 and 761 rpm and at three moisture content (MC) levels (wet basis) of 20, 25 and 30 � 20 At 30 � 0 MC, highest pellet output of 34. 3 kg/hr and 40. 4 kg/hr were obtained for die speeds of 507 and 761 rpm respectively. Higher pellet output obtained from die speed of 761 rpm could be {{as a result of the}} production of higher heat which resulted in proper gelatinization of the carbohydrate in the compounded feed. The gelatinized starch acts as a binding agent and this reduces crumbling during pelleting. The small and medium scale fish farmer can operate the machine because of its simplicity and this will alleviate the problem of sourcing for imported fish feed...|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{audio tape}} recorder was a non-magnetic, non-electric version invented by Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory and patented in 1886 (...) [...] It employed a 3/16 in strip of wax-covered paper that was coated by dipping it {{in a solution}} of beeswax and paraffin and then had one side scraped clean, with the other side allowed to harden. The machine was of sturdy wood and metal construction, and hand-powered {{by means of a}} knob fastened to the flywheel. The wax strip passed from one eight-inch reel around the periphery of a pulley (with guide flanges) mounted above the <b>V-pulleys</b> on the main vertical shaft, where it came in contact with either its recording or playback stylus. The tape was then taken up on the other reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a vibrating mica diaphragm, cut the wax from the strip. In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus, attached to a rubber diaphragm, carried the reproduced sounds through an ear tube to its listener.|$|R
