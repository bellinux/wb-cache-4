40|$|This book {{primarily}} explores two topics: {{the representation}} of simultaneous, cooperative work processes in product development projects {{with the help of}} statistical models, and the assessment of their emergent complexity using a metric from theoretical physics (Effective Measure Complexity, EMC). It is intended to promote more effective management of development projects by shifting the focus from the structural complexity of the product being developed to the dynamic complexity of the development processes involved. The book is divided into four main parts, the first of which provides an introduction to <b>vector</b> <b>autoregression</b> <b>models,</b> periodic <b>vector</b> <b>autoregression</b> <b>models</b> and linear dynamical systems for modeling cooperative work in product development projects. The second part presents theoretical approaches for assessing complexity in the product development environment, while the third highlights and explains closed-form solutions for the complexity metric EMC for <b>vector</b> <b>autoregression</b> <b>models</b> and linear dynamical systems. Lastly, part four validates the models and methods using a case study from the industry, together with several Monte Carlo experiments. Presenting a truly unique, integrated treatment of statistical approaches for modeling simultaneous, cooperative work processes in product development projects and assessing their complexity, the book offers a valuable resource for researchers in Industrial Engineering, Engineering Management and Project Management, as well as Project Managers seeking to model and evaluate their own development projects...|$|R

40|$|Inflation {{is one of}} {{the crucial}} modern {{macroeconomic}} problems. Nowadays the issue of inflation is very relevant. Inflation is a constant and consistent increase in the general price level in the country, due to which the purchasing power of a national currency unit decreases. In practice, the measures of inflation are various price indices, such as a consumer price index (CPI), producer price index (PPI), or gross domestic product deflator. However, inflation is usually defined as a change in the HCPI over a year. Time series models, linear regression models and a <b>vector</b> <b>autoregression</b> <b>model</b> (VAR) can be used to model and forecast inflation processes. This paper examines Lithuanian consumer price inflation using a modern stationary time series and econometric theory. The <b>vector</b> <b>autoregression</b> <b>model</b> is proposed for inflation modelling. Theoretical aspects of model estimation are reviewed: time series stationarity, model identification, parameter estimation, model usage and forecasts. The stationarity of the HCPI index and exogenous variables are analyzed using the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test. A <b>vector</b> <b>autoregression</b> <b>model</b> of Lithuanian inflation processes is investigated and proposed for inflation modelling. The obtained model is used for forecasting purposes and shows a fairly high degree of accuracy of the inflation forecast in the coming 12 -month period...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{relations between}} stock markets and economic tendencies of BRICS group, {{which consists of}} 5 world‘s developing countries. The review of previous scientific researches has revealed that such concept of interaction analysis is not new. Nevertheless, aforementioned investigation does not lose its relevance, {{because the majority of}} previous researches mostly have been focused just on developed countries. In addition, recent investigations recognize that developing countries {{have a significant impact on}} the development of global economics. Data issues as insufficient access to data and newest information analysis demand remain significant concerns for such research. Therefore, <b>vector</b> <b>autoregression</b> <b>models</b> are used in this study in order to evaluate relations between economic and stock market tendencies for chosen countries. Meanwhile, one-dimensional models for financial time series are applied seeking to evaluate stock market tendencies of BRICS countries. Afterwards, calculations of logarithms and growth rates (returns) are used for modifications of selected stock market and economic tendencies indicators, so the risk of spurious relationships detection could be reduced. It has been noted that components related to variance and shocks of chosen indexes, which reflect stock markets of BRICS countries, significantly affect these time series after the one-dimensional models is set. This means that aforementioned models are more suitable for forecasting the risk rather than the returns of indexes. Moreover, after setting up multivariate (<b>vector</b> <b>autoregression)</b> <b>models,</b> no mutual relations between economic situation indicators and stock indexes have been detected. Furthermore, stock indexes of Brazil, Russia and the Republic of South Africa affects composite leading indicator models while composite leading indicators themselves are significant parameters for stock indexes of India and China. Likewise, some economic indicators such as money supply and inflation leads stock indexes meantime particular economic indicators (exchange rate and inflation) are affected by same stock indexes. Nevertheless, structural analysis shows transient relationships between the stock indexes and the economic indicators of BRICS countries. According to determined forecast errors of predictions on stock indexes, one-dimensional models are more suitable for forecasting of such time series. During the separate investigation of Russia‘s case, the factors to represent stock market‘s indicators are chosen those which contain information of returns for stocks quoted in Moscow Exchange.
