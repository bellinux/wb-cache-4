When ruthless railroad man Mike King (Richard Widmark) <b>violates</b> <b>a</b> <b>treaty</b> by building on Indian territory, the Arapaho Indians retaliate by stampeding buffalo through his camp, killing many, including women and children. Disgusted, Zeb resigns and heads to Arizona.|$|R
50|$|Mason and Dixon {{failed to}} measure {{the entire length of}} the south {{boundary}} of Pennsylvania as determined by its charter. In the summer of 1767, the surveying party crossed the Monongahela River and the Great Catawba War Path, <b>violating</b> <b>a</b> <b>treaty</b> limiting the westward expansion of English settlements. Not wishing to risk inciting native hostilities, Mason and Dixon were forced to return east after making their final observations at the crest of Brown's Hill.|$|R
50|$|An {{additional}} {{problem was}} that refusing Abutalebi's entry to the United States would <b>violate</b> <b>a</b> 1947 <b>treaty</b> agreement that was a prerequisite for the United Nations to locate their headquarters in New York City.|$|R
50|$|Philinus of Agrigentum (3rd-century BCE) lived {{during the}} First Punic War and wrote its history from a pro-Carthaginian standpoint. His {{writings}} {{were used as}} a source by Polybius for {{his description of the}} First Punic War. Although Polybius uses Philinus' writings he does also accuse him of being biased and inconsistent. Philinus maintained that the initial Roman intervention in Sicily {{at the start of the}} First Punic War <b>violated</b> <b>a</b> <b>treaty</b> between Rome and Carthage which recognized Roman sovereignty on the Italian peninsula and Carthaginian control in Sicily.|$|R

Spira took {{a photograph of}} a primate who had been imprisoned for months in a Bethesda Naval Hospital chair to the Black Star Wire Service, which sent the picture around the world. It was shown to Indira Gandhi, India's PM, who cancelled monkey exports to the United States, because the photograph suggested the U.S. Navy was <b>violating</b> <b>a</b> <b>treaty</b> with India that forbade military research on animals.|$|R

50|$|<b>Violating</b> <b>a</b> <b>treaty</b> of 1868, George Armstrong Custer led an {{expedition}} to the Black Hills region in 1874, and according to custom he camped near Bear Butte. Custer verified the rumors of gold in the Black Hills, and Bear Butte then served as an easily identifiable landmark for the rush of invading prospectors and settlers into the region. Indian reaction to the illegal movements of whites into the area was intense and hostile. Ultimately the government reneged on its treaty obligations regarding the Black Hills and instead embarked on a program to confine all northern Plains tribes to reservations.|$|R

25|$|The white {{minority}} in South Carolina felt more threatened {{than in other}} parts of the South, and reacted more to the economic Panic of 1819, the Missouri Controversy of 1820, and attempts at emancipation in the form of the Ohio Resolutions of 1824 and the American Colonization Petition of 1827. South Carolina's first attempt at nullification occurred in 1822, when South Carolina adopted a policy of jailing foreign black sailors at South Carolina ports. This policy <b>violated</b> <b>a</b> <b>treaty</b> between the United Kingdom and the United States, but South Carolina defied a complaint from Britain through American Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and a United States Supreme Court justice's federal circuit decision condemning the jailings.|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that international cooperation can arise through strategies of reciprocity. In this paper, we investigate whether citizens in the United States and twenty-five other countries support reciprocity to deal with climate change. We find little public enthusiasm for intrinsic reciprocity, in which countries restrain their consumption of fossil fuels {{if and only if}} other countries do the same. In contrast, we find significant support for extrinsic reciprocity, in which countries enforce cooperation by linking issues. Citizens support economic sanctions against polluters and are willing to shame them in international forums, especially when the polluters are <b>violating</b> <b>a</b> <b>treaty.</b> Cooperation could, therefore, emerge from efforts to link climate with other issues and to embed climate commitments in international law...|$|R
40|$|This Comment {{assesses the}} use of the Alien Tort Statute (“ATS”) as a {{jurisdictional}} basis for claims of international copyright infringement occurring outside of the United States. Under the ATS, aliens may sue in United States district courts for torts that amount <b>to</b> violations of <b>treaties</b> or the law of nations. Given that copyright infringement is a tort, an alien may only be able to establish ATS jurisdiction in a suit of extraterritorial infringement if the infringement <b>violated</b> <b>a</b> <b>treaty</b> or the law of nations. This comment argues that extraterritorial copyright infringement does indeed amount to a violation of the law of nations. Consequently, an alien’s claim of extraterritorial copyright infringement may invoke ATS jurisdiction, even under the demanding standards imposed by Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain...|$|R
5000|$|In August 1914, {{as part of}} the Schlieffen Plan, the German Army invaded and {{occupied}} the neutral nation of Belgium without explicit warning, which <b>violated</b> <b>a</b> <b>treaty</b> of 1839 that the German chancellor dismissed as a [...] "scrap of paper" [...] and the 1907 Hague Convention on Opening of Hostilities. Within the first two months of the war, the German occupiers terrorized the Belgians, killing thousands of civilians and looting and burning scores of towns, including Leuven, which housed the country's preeminent university, mainly in fear of Belgian resistance fighters, or francs-tireurs. This action was in violation of the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare provisions that prohibited collective punishment on civilians and looting and destruction of civilian property in occupied territories.|$|R
