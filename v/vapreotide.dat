40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of delivering <b>vapreotide,</b> a somatostatin analogue, by transdermal iontophoresis. METHODS: In vitro experiments were conducted using dermatomed porcine ear skin and heat-separated epidermis. In addition to quantifying <b>vapreotide</b> transport into and across the skin, the effect of peptide delivery on skin permselectivity was also measured. The influence of (1) current density, (2) pre- and post-treatment of the skin, (3) competitive ions, and (4) inclusion of albumin in the receptor on <b>vapreotide</b> delivery were investigated. RESULTS: Epidermis proved to be a better model than dermatomed skin for <b>vapreotide</b> transport studies. Despite the susceptibility of <b>vapreotide</b> to enzymatic degradation, a flux of 1. 7 microg/cm 2 per hour was achieved after 7 h of constant current iontophoresis (0. 15 mA/cm 2). Post-iontophoretic extraction revealed that, depending on the experimental conditions, 80 - 300 microg of peptide were bound to the skin. <b>Vapreotide</b> was found to interact with the skin and displayed a current-dependent inhibition of electroosmosis. However, neither the pre-treatment strategies to saturate the putative binding sites nor the post-treatment protocols to displace the bound peptide were effective. CONCLUSION: Based on the observed transport rate of <b>vapreotide</b> across porcine epidermis and its clinical pharmacokinetics, therapeutic concentrations should be achievable using a 15 -cm 2 patch...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to develop {{biodegradable}} microspheres for controlled delivery of the somatostatin analogue <b>vapreotide</b> and maintenance of sustained plasma levels over 2 – 4 weeks after a single injection in rats. <b>Vapreotide</b> was microencapsulated into end-group capped and uncapped low molecular weight poly(lactide) (PLA) and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) by spray-drying and coacervation. Microspheres were prepared from single and blended (1 : 1) polymer types. The microparticles were characterized for peptide loading, in vitro release and pharmocokinetics in rats. Spray-drying and coacervation produced microspheres in the size range of 1 – 15 and 10 – 70 μm, respectively, and with encapsulation efficiencies varying between 46 % and 87 %. In vitro release of <b>vapreotide</b> followed a regular pattern and lasted more than 4 weeks, time at which 40 – 80 % of the total dose were released. Microspheres made of 14 -kDa end-group uncapped PLGA 50 : 50 or 1 : 1 blends of this polymer with 35 kDa end-group uncapped PLGA 50 : 50 gave the best release profiles and yielded the most sustained plasma levels above a pre-defined 1 ng/ml over approximately 14 days. In vitro/in vivo correlation analyses showed for several microsphere formulations a linear correlation between the mean residence time in vivo and the mean dissolution time (r= 0. 958) and also between the amount released between 6 h and 14 days and the AUC 6 h– 14 d (r= 0. 932). For several other parameters or time periods, no in vitro/in vivo correlation was found. This study demonstrates that controlled release of the <b>vapreotide</b> is possible in vivo for a duration of a least 2 weeks when administered i. m. to rats.

40|$|The {{determination}} of in vitro release kinetics of peptides from poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres generally requires optimization {{of the test}} conditions for a given formulation. This is particularly important when in vitro/in vivo correlation should be determined. Here, the somatostatin analogue <b>vapreotide</b> pamoate, an octapeptide, was microencapsulated into PLGA 50 : 50 by spray-drying. The solubility of this peptide and its in vitro release kinetics from the microspheres were studied in various test media. The solubility of <b>vapreotide</b> pamoate was approximately 20 – 40 μg/ml in 67 mM phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at pH 7. 4, but increased to approximately 500 – 1000 μg/ml at a pH of 3. 5. At low pH, the solubility increased with the buffer concentration (1 – 66 mM). Very importantly, proteins (aqueous bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution or human serum) appeared to solubilize the peptide pamoate, resulting in solubilities ranging from 900 to 6100 μg/ml. The release rate was also greatly affected by the medium composition. Typically, in PBS of pH 7. 4, only 33 ± 1 % of the peptide were released within 4 days, whereas 53 ± 2 and 61 ± 0. 9 % were released in 1 % BSA solution and serum, respectively. The type of medium was found critical for the estimation of the in vivo release. The in vivo release kinetics of <b>vapreotide</b> pamoate from PLGA microspheres following administration to rats were qualitatively in good agreement with those obtained in vitro using serum as release medium.

40|$|SUMMARY Different {{treatment}} {{strategies have}} been used to control variceal haemorrhage including drugs, oesophageal tambonade, endoscopie sclerotherapy or ligation, TIPS, and surgery. Optimal therapy should stop bleeding and prevent early rebleeding. The initial resuscitation of patients {{is as important as the}} other specific measures to promote haemostasis. Balloon tambonade is a highly effective treatment to achieve a temporary control of bleeding but it carries a very high risk of complications. Pharmacologie treatment has the theoretical advantage of allowing specific therapy without requiring any complicated equipment and experienced personnel. Drugs currently used in the treatment include vasopressin, terlipressin and somatostatin or its analogues octreotide and <b>vapreotide.</b> In clinical studies somatostatin was more effective than vasopressin and as effective as terlipressin but with improved safety profile. Endoscopie treatments (sclerotherapy and ligation) are highly effective in achieving haemostasis but they are largely depended on the experience of the endoscopist. The association of endoscopie with pharmacologie therapy (preferably somatostatin), used as soon as the diagnosis is suspected (before the endoscopy) and continued for five days, currently appears to be the best approach to treatment. TIPS is indicated in patients in whom bleeding cannot be controlled or recurs after two sessions of endoscopie treatment.

Various PLGA were studied as biodegradable drug carriers and their in vivo release profiles were examined. Poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) implants containing RC- 160 were prepared by an extrusion method and the drug release was evaluated in vivo in rats using a radioimmunoassay method. The effects on the release profile, obtained by varying molecular weight, lactide/glycolide ratio and core loading were studied. The effects of polymer end groups were also investigated. Gel permeation chromatography was employed to characterize the loss in molecular weight of the different polymers after extrusion and γ-sterilization.

40|$|Despite {{developments}} in diagnosis and treatment, lung {{cancer is the}} commonest {{cause of cancer death}} in Europe and North America. Due to increasing cigarette consumption, the incidence of the disease and resultant mortality is rising dramatically in women. Novel approaches to the management of lung cancer are urgently required. Somatostatin is a tetradecapeptide first identified in the pituitary and subsequently throughout the body particularly in neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract and the nervous system. The peptide has numerous functions including inhibition of hormone release, immunomodulation and neurotransmission and is an endogenous inhibitor of cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Somatostatin and its analogs, including octreotide (SMS 201 - 995), somatuline (BIM 23014) and <b>vapreotide</b> (RC- 160), act by binding to specific somatostatin receptors (SSTR) of which there are 5 principal subtypes, SSTR- 1 - 5. Although elevated plasma somatostatin levels may be detected in 14 - 15 % of patients, tumor cell expression appears rare. SSTR may be expressed by lung tumors, particularly small cell lung cancer and bronchial carcinoid disease. [111 In]pentetreotide scintigraphy may {{have a role to play}} in the localization and staging of lung cancers both before and following treatment, and in detecting relapsed disease. The potential role of radiolabelled somatostatin analogs as radiotherapeutic agents in the management of lung cancer is currently being explored.

40|$|Somatostatin, a peptidic hormone {{also known}} as {{somatotropin}} release-inhibiting factor (SRIF), is implicated in multiple biological functions, mediated by direct interaction of the peptide with a family of structurally related, G-protein coupled transmembrane receptors (GPCRs), named SSTR 1 - 5. However, the full therapeutic potential of SRIF cannot be further exploited owing to its short half-life of < 3 min in plasma and its lack of selectivity against all receptors. With the aim to overcome these limitations, many SRIF analogs containing key modifications have been synthesized over recent decades. Octreotide, lanreotide, <b>vapreotide</b> and pasireotide are the four synthetic analogs that have reached the market so far. They are shorter analogs they contain a more rigid ring than somatostatin. Consequently, they are long-acting analogs with increased receptor selectivity. Also, they share a similar fragment including residues Phe/Thr 7 -D-Trp 8 -Lys 9 -Thr/Val 10, which populates betaturn conformations and has been proposed to be the pharmacophore of the hormone. Early studies uncovered the possibility that an aromatic interaction between Phe 6, Phe 7 or Phe 11 {{plays a key role}} in the structural stabilization of the hormone. We considered that exploring the presumed aromatic interactions that stabilize some bioactive conformations in SRIF would be a unique way to obtain analogs with enhanced stability and conformational rigidity, and improved biological activity. For this purpose, we have synthesized and studied 24 SRIF-analogs containing aromatic non-natural amino acids as site-directed modifications. The gram-scale syntheses of these amino acids (3 -mesitylalanine (Msa), 3 -(3 ’, 4 ’, 5 ’-trimethylphenyl) -alanine (Tmp) and 3 -(3 ’, 5 ’-difluorophenyl) -alanine (Dfp)) were achieved by different routes, using a Rhodium-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation reaction as source of enantioselectivity. These non-natural residues displayed specific hydrophobic, electronic and steric properties. The introduction of Msa, Tmp and Dfp residues in the tetradecapeptidic SRIF scaffold allowed us to prove and modulate the noncovalent interactions between the aromatic residues in the natural hormone somatostatin. Several of these analogs showed a high conformational rigidity relative to that of SRIF, which allowed us to characterize for the first time the 3 D structures of their major conformations in solution using NMR and computational techniques. These investigations allowed us to prove that bulky, hydrophobic and electron-rich residues (i. e. Msa or Tmp) in position 7 shifts the conformational equilibrium in solution toward a major conformation that should be very similar to that of SRIF when it binds to the SST 2 receptor. We considered that an aromatic interaction between the Ar 6 -Ar 11 residues is the factor that contributes the most to stabilize this particular conformation. In this regard, we have used the L-Msa 7 _D-Trp 8 fragment to fine-tune the Ar 6 -Ar 11 interaction, thus developing several highly SSTR 2 -active and –selective 14 -residue SRIF analogs. The introduction of Dfp residues allowed us to prove that this electron-poor aromatic amino acid in position 11 engage an aromatic interaction with the cross-strand Phe 6. Our studies involving SRIF analogs containing the Cha amino acid indicated that the specific interaction between aromatic residues that contributes to the conformational stabilization in SRIF is unique to aromatic moieties, and is not exclusively driven by a hydrophobic collapse. Our studies, initially devoted to prove the postulated Phe 6 -Phe 11 interaction in somatostatin, have led us to gain invaluable and unprecedented insight into structure-activity relationships of somatostatin and SRIF analogs. Looking ahead, despite we have been able to exploit specific aromatic interactions to obtain directed SSTR-selectivity, there is still much that we do not yet understand regarding the nature of these non-covalent interactions. Our combination of NMR and computational techniques in the study of 14 -residue SRIF analogs has provided a powerful tool to fill this gap. Taking into account the wide distribution of SSTR 2 and its role in SRIF-regulated processes, the therapeutic potential of SRIF analogs that bind exclusively to this receptor continue to be of high importance. Our highly potent and SSTR 2 -selective peptides, which presumably show an appropriate persistence (half-life) in blood, would certainly present a potential alternative to the currently marketed drugs. The success in future design of 14 -residue SRIF analogs will rely on the right modifications of its sequence based on the structural information obtained from our studies. La hormona peptídica somatostatina (SRIF) está implicada en un gran número de funciones biológicas, mediadas por la interacción directa del péptido con una familia de cinco GPCRs, comúnmente denominados SSTR 1 - 5. Sin embargo, no ha sido posible maximizar el potencial terapéutico de la somatostatina debido a su bajo tiempo de vida media en plasma y a la falta de selectividad por sus receptores. Con el objetivo de superar esas limitaciones se han sintetizado un gran número de análogos de somatostatina. La mayoría de estos análogos son octapéptidos, y por lo tanto son más rígidos que la somatostatina, más estables y más selectivos frente a los cinco receptores distintos. Los recientes avances en la síntesis de péptidos en fase sólida nos llevaron a reconsiderar la estructura completa de la somatostatina (es decir, los catorce residuos) como molde para sintetizar nuevos análogos que tuvieran mayor estabilidad y selectividad. Además, trabajando con tetradecapéptidos estaríamos estructuralmente mucho más cerca de la hormona natural de lo que lo están los octapéptidos. Nosotros consideramos que el estudio de las presuntas interacciones aromáticas que estabilizan ciertas conformaciones bioactivas en SRIF podría funcionar como un método único para obtener análogos con mayor estabilidad y rigidez conformacional, así como una actividad biológica mejorada. Para ello, estudiamos la sustitución de las Phe 6, Phe 7 y Phe 11 por tres aminoácidos aromáticos no naturales: 3 -mesitilalanina (Msa), 3 -(3 ’, 4 ’, 5 ’-trimetilfenil) -alanina (Tmp) y 3 -(3 ’, 5 ’-difluorofenil) -alanina (Dfp). Seleccionamos estos tres residuos por su alta hidrofobicidad y sus peculiares propiedades electrónicas y estéricas. En esta tesis doctoral probamos que la introducción de estos residuos aromáticos en la secuencia de somatosatina incrementa ciertas interacciones aromáticas entre Ar 6 -Ar 11, lo que aumenta la rigidez conformacional de estos péptidos. Debido a ello, las estructuras de las conformaciones mayoritarias de estos tetradecapéptidos has sido por primera vez caracterizadas por técnicas de RMN y computacionales. La mayoría de los análogos presentaban perfiles de selectividad y afinidad muy interesantes. Identificamos el fragmento L-Msa 7 -D-Trp 8 como clave para incrementar la interacción Ar 6 -Ar 11 y obtener alta afinidad por el receptor SSTR 2, y lo hemos usado junto con otros aminoácidos no naturales, para obtener los tetradecapéptidos conformacionalmente más rígidos descritos hasta la fecha, con una actividad y selectividad excepcionales frente a SSTR 2...|$|E
