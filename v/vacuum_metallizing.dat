50|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>metallizing</b> {{involves}} {{heating the}} coating metal to its boiling {{point in a}} vacuum chamber, then letting condensation deposit the metal on the substrate's surface. Resistance heating, electron beam, or plasma heating is used to vaporize the coating metal. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>metallizing</b> was used to deposit aluminum on the large glass mirrors of reflecting telescopes, such as with the Hale telescope.|$|E
50|$|Rubberplas BSP Ltd, Mary Vale Road, {{manufactures}} Rubber Moulding, Thermoplastic Moulding & <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Metallizing</b> for automotive {{and domestic}} industries. It also launched the Golf Grass Mat used to install permanent or temporary walkways around Golf Courses.|$|E
40|$|The {{most popular}} {{technique}} for the metalic finishing of plastic are electroplating and <b>vacuum</b> <b>metallizing.</b> Electroplating for plastics is {{a surface coating}} process with metal in the electrolyte cell, where the role of plastic is as a catode, and metal as an anode. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>metallizing</b> for plastics is {{a process in which}} plastics surfaces are thinly coated with metal by exposing them to the vapor of metal that has been evaporated under vacumm...|$|E
40|$|Composite {{flexible}} multilayer insulation systems (MLI) {{were evaluated}} for thermal performance and compared with currently used fibrous silica (baseline) insulation system. The systems described are multilayer insulations consisting of alternating layers of metal foil and scrim ceramic cloth or <b>vacuum</b> <b>metallized</b> polymeric films quilted together using ceramic thread. A silicon carbide thread {{for use in}} the quilting and the method of making it are also described. These systems provide lightweight thermal insulation for a variety of uses, particularly on the surface of aerospace vehicles subject to very high temperatures during flight...|$|R
5000|$|The plaques {{themselves}} contain various items {{under the}} glass. Modern awards often use CDs instead of records. Most gold and platinum records are actually vinyl records {{which have been}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>metallized</b> and tinted, while trimmed and plated metal [...] "masters", [...] "mothers", or [...] "stampers" [...] (metal parts used for pressing records out of vinyl) were initially used. The groove on the record may not match the actual recording being awarded. Individual plaque-makers produced their awards according to available materials and techniques employed by their graphic arts departments. The plaques, depending on size and elaborateness of design, cost anywhere between US$135 and $275, most often ordered and purchased by the record label that issued the original recording.|$|R
50|$|Mark Spaulding {{became the}} {{associate}} publisher/editor-in-chief of CONVERTING QUARTERLY in September 2010. CONVERTING QUARTERLY {{is the official}} publication of the Assn. of International Metallizers, Coaters & Laminators, headquartered in Ft. Mill, SC. CONVERTING QUARTERLY is a new hybrid technical-journal and B2B trade magazine with five Q&A technical columns and 8-12 technical articles in each issue. Content focuses on the web-processing and finishing technologies of coating, laminating, <b>vacuum</b> coating and <b>metallizing,</b> slitting, rewinding, diecutting, flexographic and gravure printing.|$|R
40|$|Spurred R&D toward {{improved}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>metallizing</b> techniques led to {{an extensive}} line of commercial products, from insulated outdoor garments to packaging for foods, from wall coverings to window shades, from life rafts to candy wrappings, reflective blankets to photographic reflectors. Metallized Products, Inc. (MPI) {{was one of the}} companies that worked with NASA in development of the original space materials. MPI markets its own metallized products and supplies materials to other manufacturers. One of the most widely used MPI products is TXG laminate. An example is a reflective kite, the S. O. S. Signal Kite that can be flown as high as 200 feet to enhance radar and visual detectability. It offers a boon to campers, hikers, mountain climbers and boaters. It is produced by Solar Reflections, Inc. The company also markets a solar reflective hat. Another example is by Pro-Tektion, Inc. to provide protection for expensive musical equipment that have sensitive electronic components subject to damage from the heat of stage lights, dust, or rain at outdoor concerts. MP supplied the material and acceptance of the covers by the sound industry has been excellent...|$|E
