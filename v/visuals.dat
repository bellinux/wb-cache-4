40|$|To {{develop a}} {{comprehensive}} and systematic {{approach to the}} automated design of <b>visual</b> discourse, we introduce a <b>visual</b> task taxonomy that interfaces high-level presentation intents with low-level <b>visual</b> techniques.

Therefore, we can characterize <b>visual</b> tasks by their <b>visual</b> accomplishments and implications.

5|$|As with {{previous}} games, the <b>visuals</b> of End of Ages were widely praised. The switch to real-time rendering was generally {{seen as a}} positive step. The game's music was lauded; GameSpot's review noted the use of music in End of Ages was sparse, but the little audio present set the proper tone for different Ages. A few reviewers, such as Charles Herold of the New York Times, felt that the graphics fell short of what was possible, especially compared to the prerendered <b>visuals</b> of Myst IV: Revelation. While Greg Kasavin of GameSpot felt that though the <b>visuals</b> were on par {{with previous}} games, End of Ages was missing several elements which made Myst IV more immersive; only important, story-driving items could be interacted with, for example, and the player makes no sounds or footsteps in the game.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 1995 at Millenium Interactive in Cambridge under the working title of Dead Man Dan.

40|$|The {{fruit fly}} Drosophila melanogaster has a {{sophisticated}} <b>visual</b> system and exhibits complex <b>visual</b> behaviors. <b>Visual</b> responses, vision processing and higher cognitive processes in Drosophila {{have been studied}} extensively. However, {{little is known about}} whether the retinal location of <b>visual</b> stimuli can affect fruit fly performance in various <b>visual</b> tasks. We tested the response of wild-type Berlin flies to <b>visual</b> stimuli at several vertical locations. Three paradigms were used in our study: <b>visual</b> operant conditioning, <b>visual</b> object fixation and optomotor response. We observed an acute zone for <b>visual</b> feature memorization in the upper <b>visual</b> field when <b>visual</b> patterns were presented with a black background. However, when a white background was used, the acute zone was in the lower <b>visual</b> field. Similar to <b>visual</b> feature memorization, the best locations for <b>visual</b> object fixation and optomotor response to a single moving stripe were in the lower <b>visual</b> field with a white background and the upper <b>visual</b> field with a black background. The preferred location for the optomotor response to moving gratings was around the equator of the <b>visual</b> field. Our results suggest that different <b>visual</b> processing pathways are involved in different <b>visual</b> tasks {{and that there is a}} certain degree of overlap between the pathways for <b>visual</b> feature memorization, <b>visual</b> object fixation and optomotor response...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were 1) to probe the effects of <b>visual</b> motion adaptation on early <b>visual</b> and V 5 /MT cortical excitability and 2) to investigate whether changes in cortical excitability following <b>visual</b> motion adaptation are related to the degree of <b>visual</b> dependency, i. e., an overreliance on <b>visual</b> cues compared with vestibular or proprioceptive cues. Participants were exposed to a roll motion <b>visual</b> stimulus before, during, and after <b>visual</b> motion adaptation. At these stages, 20 transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses at phosphene threshold values were applied over early <b>visual</b> and V 5 /MT cortical areas from which the probability of eliciting a phosphene was calculated. Before and after adaptation, participants aligned the subjective <b>visual</b> vertical in front of the roll motion stimulus as a marker of <b>visual</b> dependency. During adaptation, early <b>visual</b> cortex excitability decreased whereas V 5 /MT excitability increased. After adaptation, both early <b>visual</b> and V 5 /MT excitability were increased. The roll motion-induced tilt of the subjective <b>visual</b> vertical (<b>visual</b> dependence) was not influenced by <b>visual</b> motion adaptation and did not correlate with phosphene threshold or <b>visual</b> cortex excitability. We conclude that early <b>visual</b> and V 5 /MT cortical excitability is differentially affected by <b>visual</b> motion adaptation. Furthermore, excitability in the early or late <b>visual</b> cortex is not associated with an increase in <b>visual</b> reliance during spatial orientation. Our findings complement earlier studies that have probed <b>visual</b> cortical excitability following motion adaptation and highlight the differential role of the early <b>visual</b> cortex and V 5 /MT in <b>visual</b> motion processing. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We examined the influence of <b>visual</b> motion adaptation on <b>visual</b> cortex excitability and found a differential effect in V 1 /V 2 compared with V 5 /MT. Changes in <b>visual</b> excitability following motion adaptation were not related to the degree of an individual’s <b>visual</b> dependency...|$|R

50|$|The Divided <b>Visual</b> Field Paradigm is an {{experimental}} technique that involves measuring task performance when <b>visual</b> stimuli are presented {{on the left}} or right <b>visual</b> hemifields. If a <b>visual</b> stimulus appears in the left <b>visual</b> field (LVF), the <b>visual</b> information is initially projected to the right cerebral hemisphere (RH), and conversely, if a <b>visual</b> stimulus appears in the right <b>visual</b> field (RVF), the <b>visual</b> information is initially received by the left cerebral hemisphere (LH). In this way, if a cerebral hemisphere has functional advantages with some aspect of a particular task, an experimenter might observe improvements in task performance when the <b>visual</b> information is presented on the contralateral <b>visual</b> field.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA steady {{increase}} in reading speed is {{the hallmark of}} normal reading acquisition. However, little is known of the influence of <b>visual</b> attention capacity on children's reading speed. The number of distinct <b>visual</b> elements that can be simultaneously processed at a glance (dubbed the <b>visual</b> attention span), predicts single-word reading speed in both normal reading and dyslexic children. However, the exact processes that account for the relationship between the <b>visual</b> attention span and reading speed remain to be specified. We used the Theory of <b>Visual</b> Attention to estimate <b>visual</b> processing speed and <b>visual</b> short-term memory capacity from a multiple letter report task in eight and nine year old children. The <b>visual</b> attention span and text reading speed were also assessed. Results showed that <b>visual</b> processing speed and <b>visual</b> short term memory capacity predicted the <b>visual</b> attention span. Furthermore, <b>visual</b> processing speed predicted reading speed, but <b>visual</b> short term memory capacity did not. Finally, the <b>visual</b> attention span mediated the effect of <b>visual</b> processing speed on reading speed. These results suggest that <b>visual</b> attention capacity could constrain reading speed in elementary school children...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The Bag-of-Words (BoW) {{model is}} prone to the {{deficiency}} of spatial constraints among <b>visual</b> words. The {{state of the art}} methods encode spatial information via <b>visual</b> phrases. However, these methods discard the spatial context among <b>visual</b> phrases instead. To address the problem, this letter introduces a novel <b>visual</b> concept, the <b>Visual</b> Phraselet, as a kind of similarity measurement between images. The <b>visual</b> phraselet refers to the spatial consistent group of <b>visual</b> phrases. In a simple yet effective manner, <b>visual</b> phraselet filters out false <b>visual</b> phrase matches, and is much more discriminative than both <b>visual</b> word and <b>visual</b> phrase. To boost the discovery of <b>visual</b> phraselets, we apply the soft quantization scheme. Our method is evaluated through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (Oxford 5 K, Paris 6 K and Flickr 1 M). We report significant improvements as large as 54. 6 % over the baseline approach, thus validating the concept of <b>visual</b> phraselet.
