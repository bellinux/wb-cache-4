500|$|Despite this, {{possibly}} due {{to their}} concerns with passenger comfort (the <b>VOR</b> 1 <b>approach</b> would have required performing the [...] "circle to land" [...] maneuver at a relatively low altitude over the airport to land on runway 19), or possibly by simply being late to {{set up for the}} recommended <b>VOR</b> 1 <b>approach</b> (the flight time was only about 8 minutes from takeoff at Albany to the Glens Falls area, with a significant tailwind component of approximately 50 knots), the crew did not execute the <b>VOR</b> 1 <b>approach.</b> Instead, the crew appeared to select an improvised and unauthorized modified version of the VOR/DME 19 approach, which included flying outbound followed by a course reversal at about [...] north of the airport, over Lake George. As the crew performed what appeared to be an unpublished and unauthorized procedure turn for course reversal on the VOR/DME 19 approach path, they descended prematurely and hit the side of a mountain. It was subsequently determined that a [...] southerly wind created a downdraft effect which, coupled with the aircraft's low altitude over the terrain, contributed to the crash.|$|R

50|$|As of 2005, due to {{advances}} in technology, many airports are replacing <b>VOR</b> and NDB <b>approaches</b> with RNAV (GPS) approach procedures; however, receiver and data update costs are still significant enough that many small general aviation aircraft are not {{equipped with a}} GPS certified for primary navigation or approaches.|$|R
50|$|When {{visibility}} and ceiling are below minimums for the River Visual and southerly winds restrict northbound runway operations, aircraft fly an offset localizer or GPS approach to Runway 19, again involving a final turn moments before touchdown, or they fly a <b>VOR</b> or GPS <b>approach</b> {{to either of}} the shorter Runways 15 and 22, which are within FAA limitations for most airline jets.|$|R
50|$|The {{accident}} aircraft, a Convair 240, commenced a non-precision <b>VOR</b> <b>approach</b> to the uncontrolled airport {{despite the}} fact that visibility, at one-eighth of a mile in fog, was below the legal minimum required for such an approach.

25|$|When the River Visual is not {{available}} due to visibility or winds, aircraft may fly an offset localizer or GPS approach to Runway 19 along a similar course (flying a direct approach course on instruments as far as Rosslyn, and then turning to align with the runway visually moments before touchdown). Most airliners are also capable of performing a <b>VOR</b> or GPS <b>approach</b> to the shorter Runway 15/33.

40|$|A ground {{simulator}} {{experiment was}} conducted on the Flight Simulator for Advanced Aircraft at Ames Research Center to investigate the influence of several static stability and stability/control augmentation design parameters on helicopter flying qualities during terminal area operations in instrument conditions. Effects of light turbulence were included. Two levels of static stability in each rotational axis (pitch, roll, yaw) were examined for a hingeless rotor configuration. The variations in pitch and roll were: (1) stable and (2) neutral static stability; in yaw there were two stable levels. Four types of stability/control augmentation were also examined for the lower level of static stability in each axis. This latter investigation covered three helicopter rotor types: hingeless, articulated, and teetering. Four pilots performed a total of 105 evaluations of these parameters for a representative <b>VOR</b> instrument <b>approach</b> task. Pilot rating results indicate the acceptability of neutral static stability longitudinally and laterally and the need for pitch-roll attitude augmentation to achieve a satisfactory system...|$|R
40|$|A "Multimode" or "switched" {{system is}} one that {{switches}} between various modes of operation. When a switch occurs from one mode to another, a discontinuity may result followed by a smooth evolution under the new regime. Characterizing the switching behavior of these systems is not well understood and, therefore, identification of multimode systems typically requires a preprocessing step to classify the observed data according to a mode of operation. A further consequence of the switched nature of these systems is that data available for parameter estimation of any subsystem may be inadequate. As such, identification and parameter estimation of multimode systems remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we 1) show that the NARMAX model structure {{can be used to}} describe the impulsive-smooth behavior of switched systems, 2) propose a modified extended least squares (MELS) algorithm to estimate the coefficients of such models, and 3) demonstrate its applicability to simulated and real data from the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (<b>VOR).</b> The <b>approach</b> will also allow the identification of other nonlinear bio-systems, suspected of containing "hard" nonlinearities...|$|R

50|$|The weather {{conditions}} in Dhaka were poor {{on the day}} of the accident; there was turbulence and heavy rain made visibility very poor. Amid these conditions, the crew first attempted a <b>VOR</b> <b>approach</b> to Zia International Airport's runway 32.

The crew then tried an ILS approach on runway 14 of the same airport, but a missed approach had to be executed again as both pilots had failed to spot the runway once again. On the crew's third approach (second on runway 14), the plane got too low while it was still several hundred meters from the runway but neither crew member realized this (due to the poor visibility) and the plane crashed into a swamp about 550 meters short of the runway.|$|E
40|$|ROG, BNatSchG und UVPG formulieren zwei analytische Aufträge in Bezug auf die "gewachsene" bzw. "historische Kulturlandschaft", nämlich zum Ersten die flächendeckende Erfassung, Auswertung und Bewertung von historischen Kulturlandschaftselementen und - strukturen als "prägende Merkmale“ sowie zweitens die Markierung von "gewachsenen Kulturlandschaften“ als Regionalisierung der gesamten Fläche der Bundesrepublik Deutschland. Beide Ansätze sind dadurch miteinander verbunden, dass Konstruktionen von "gewachsenen Kulturlandschaften“ nur als zweckbestimmte Ausgliederungen relativ homogener Räume erfolgen können, die durch eine spezifische Kombination "prägender Merkmale“ bestimmt sind. Die "prägenden Merkmale" sind analytisch fassbar als historische Landschaftselemente und -strukturen. Durch diesen Rekurs auf die Objektebene werden Wendungen wie "gewachsene Kulturlandschaft" in der Planung umsetzbar, denn an den Objekten entzünden sich Nutzungskonflikte im Spannungsfeld von Schutz und Weiterentwicklung. Diesen Gedanken folgt das in der Geographie in engem Kontakt zur Denkmalpflege entwickelte Konzept der Kulturlandschaftspflege. Deren zentrale analytische Instrumente sind die Inventarisierung von ulturlandschaftselementen und -strukturen in Kulturlandschaftskatastern“ sowie die Ausgliederung von "Kulturlandschaften“ auf dieser Basis. Der Beitrag stellt dazu in der Praxis erprobte Verfahren <b>vor.</b> <b>Approaches</b> {{towards a}} planning-oriented {{analysis}} of evolved cultural landscapes {{from the perspective}} of cultural landscape preservation In German law, the Federal Spatial Planning Act (ROG), the Federal Nature Protection Act (BNatSchG) and the Environmental Impact Assessment Act (UVPG) frame two analytical tasks with regard to “evolved” - ie, “historical” - cultural landscapes: the first is that the key elements and structures of historic cultural landscapes – the “constitutive features” – should be identified, assessed and evaluated throughout the national territory; the second is to designate “historic cultural landscapes” as {{part of the process of}} regionalising the overall territory of the Federal Republic of Germany. These two approaches are linked in as much as any attempt to create the construct of an “evolved cultural landscape” can only be a matter of hiving off relatively homogenous areas (in respect of a particular purpose) displaying a shared and specific combination of “constitutive features”. These “constitutive features” are quantifiable analytically as historic landscape elements and structures. It is only by making recourse to the level of tangible objects that such terms as “evolved cultural landscape” can be rendered capable of implementation in the planning process; as far as these individual objects are concerned, they are frequently the source of conflicting views on future uses - to preserve or to develop? This is the line underlying the concept of “preservation of the cultural landscape”, a concept from geography developed in close association with the task of preserving sites of historic interest. The key analytical instruments to support this approach are, firstly, the production of cultural landscape registers, consisting of inventories of elements and structures of cultural landscapes, and, on the basis of such registers, the identification and delineation of “cultural landscapes”. This paper describes a number of procedures which have been trialled to this end in practical contexts...|$|R
50|$|There {{were several}} {{plausible}} explanations {{that might be}} the cause of the crash of Flight 222, {{one of them was a}} steep trans cockpit authority gradient. A steep trans cockpit occurred when the First Officer didn&apos;t challenge, intervene, or corrected the Captain's mistakes. This maybe occurred due to skills comparison. Several notable flight crashes that occurred due to steep trans cockpit authority include Airblue Flight 202 and Merpati Nusantara Airlines Flight 8968. In Flight 222, First Officer Chiang did not challenge any of the mistakes that Captain Lee did. He didn&apos;t voice any concerns over the actions that Captain Lee took. It would have also increased the probability that Captain Lee made decisions without consulting the first officer. The aircraft’s impact with terrain was a direct consequence of the captain descending the aircraft below the published Minimum Descent Altitude for the runway 20 <b>VOR</b> <b>approach</b> procedure. Moreover, it was also as a result of poor planning by the crew. During the landing approach, the actions of the flight crew progressively increased the risk of a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). The crew, however, seemed unaware that an impact with terrain was almost certain until the final two seconds.|$|E
5000|$|IFP {{has three}} {{instrument}} approaches. Runway 16 has a GPS approach. Runway 34 has a GPS approach and a <b>VOR</b> <b>approach</b> using the Needles VORTAC. The GPS approach provides vertical guidance {{as well as}} course (horizontal) guidance. The Needles VORTAC approach only gives pilots course guidance. Runway 34’s GPS approach provides the lowest minimums for the Airport. The FAA approach plate for this instrument approach is shown in Appendix B. The GPS LPV approach allows aircraft {{to come down to}} about 640 feet above ground level (AGL). [...] All landing traffic in VFR weather is kept {{to the west of the}} airfield. So, right turning traffic for Runway 16 and left turning traffic for Runway 34.An airport traffic control tower is used to control traffic on the ground at IFP and in the vicinity. It is only operational from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm Mountain Time, which is their local time zone. The control tower is stationed at about midfield on the east side. When the control tower is closed, area traffic uses the common traffic advisory frequency. If the airport is closed during instrument conditions, landing traffic are controlled by the Los Angeles air route traffic control facility.|$|E
