The update added an experience-based ranking {{system in which the}} player is given a {{numerical}} <b>value</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> their amount of experience points, which are gained by shooting or killing enemies in public multiplayer. The update also addressed several issues with matchmaking, including adding bots in place of players who have quit or lost connection to the game.|$|E
5|$|Title to real {{property}} acquired by recipients with federal awards vests with the recipient. It {{must be used}} for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose. Real property may be used in other federally sponsored projects or programs that have purposes similar to the one the property was bought for, as long as the federal government authorizes it. However it may not dispose of or encumber the title to {{real property}} without prior federal government consent. When it is no longer needed for the federally supported programs or projects, the recipient must request disposition instructions from the federal government. As with equipment, if the property is sold, a proportionate share is provided to the federal government, amount of the current fair market <b>value,</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the percent of federal funds to own recipient's fund used to acquire the item.|$|E

25|$|The new {{non-domestic}} {{rating system}} {{became known as}} business rates, or sometimes the universal business rate. It retained from its predecessors {{the concept of a}} series of local rating lists, with each property being assessed for a rateable <b>value</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> rental values. Rating lists were prepared and maintained by the Valuation Office (reconstituted in 1991 as an UK Government Executive Agency, the Valuation Office Agency), while billing and collection was the responsibility of local authorities. Previously, local authorities had decided what proportion of rateable values to charge; the new system featured a centrally set multiplier, {{often referred to as the}} Uniform Business Rate, by which the basic bill was calculated. The bill could be further modified by various reliefs, including the newly introduced transitional relief, which was designed to smooth large changes in liability due to revaluations. The multiplier was calculated to ensure that, on average, bills rose by no more than the rate of inflation.|$|E
500|$|There {{are also}} team {{competitions}} such as wheelchair rugby. [...] Members {{of the team}} are each given a point <b>value</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> their activity limitation. [...] A lower score indicates a more severe activity limitation than a higher score. A team cannot {{have more than a}} certain maximum total of points on the field of play {{at the same time to}} ensure equal competition. For example, in wheelchair rugby the five players' combined disability number must total no more than eight points.|$|E
500|$|Differences between prior mercantilists and Cantillon arise {{early in}} Essai, {{regarding}} {{the origins of}} wealth and price formation on the market. Cantillon distinguishes between wealth and money, considering wealth in itself [...] "nothing but the food, conveniences, and pleasures of life." [...] While Cantillon advocated an [...] "intrinsic" [...] theory of <b>value,</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the input of land and labour (cost of production), he is considered to have touched upon a subjective theory of value. Cantillon held that market prices are not immediately decided by intrinsic value, but are derived from supply and demand. He considered market prices to be derived by comparing supply, the quantity of a particular good in a particular market, to demand, the quantity of money brought to be exchanged. Believing market prices to tend towards the intrinsic value of a good, Cantillon may have also originated the uniformity-of-profit principle—changes in the market price of a good may lead to changes in supply, reflecting a rise or fall in profit.|$|E

500|$|Equipment means tangible, {{non-expendable}} property acquired {{with federal}} assistance funds, {{that has a}} useful life {{of more than one}} year, and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit (though, consistent with a recipient’s own equipment policy, lower cost limits may be established). Basically, this section requires that, as per [...] and [...] regulations, equipment must be used in the federal program it was bought for, or—when appropriate—other federal programs. Additionally, the recipient must keep equipment records, perform a physical equipment inventory at least once every two years, and implement an appropriate internal control system to safeguard and maintain the equipment. When equipment with a current fair market value of $5,000 or more is no longer needed, it may be retained or sold, as a proportionate share is provided to the federal government amount of the current fair market <b>value,</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the percent of federal funds to own recipients fund used to buy the item.|$|E
500|$|Interviewed by G4TV, Bungie representatives saw part of {{the mixed}} and {{negative}} reception as stemming from their own marketing of the title—first as an expansion pack, then a full game. [...] "If {{you look at the}} lower scores, they almost all cite an issue in perceived <b>value</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> an initial expectation that was set for an 'expansion' and then a feeling that they were overcharged for the final product," [...] Jarrad said, echoing Staten's comment that [...] "if we'd never said the words 'expansion pack' we would have seen an appreciable increase in the review scores". Other elements they wish they had improved had they the time were the pacing and navigation of the nighttime segments and matchmaking for Firefight. Halo manager 343 Industries director Frank O'Connor said that he was glad ODST [...] "didn't take off", in his view, because it allowed people to focus on Reach and its launch and marketing.|$|E
