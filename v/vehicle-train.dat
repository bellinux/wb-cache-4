50|$|The Gerogery level {{crossing}} accident was a <b>vehicle-train</b> crash that occurred at Bells Road on the Olympic Highway, where it crossed the Main Southern railway in Gerogery, New South Wales, Australia. The crash occurred on 27 January 2001 at 16:07 {{and resulted in}} five fatalities in a car that {{was struck by a}} Melbourne-bound XPT service travelling at 160kmh. Although the train derailed in the impact, there were no deaths to the train passengers or crew. The crash site extended for more than 1 km south of the {{level crossing}}, with vehicle, train and rail track debris found throughout. There had been a continuing series of crashes at the level crossing prior to the fatal crash, resulting in the local road and rail authorities installing perceptual countermeasures such as warning signs and enhanced road markings in attempts to provide more information to drivers of the crossing location and characteristics and to influence vehicle approach speeds.|$|E

40|$|Presented at the 21 st International Conference on Auditory Display (ICAD 2015), July 6 - 10, 2015, Graz, Styria, Austria. Human factors {{research}} has {{played an important}} role in reducing the incidents of <b>vehicle-train</b> collisions at rail grade crossings over the past 30 years. With the growing popularity of in-vehicle infotainment systems and GPS devices, new opportunities arise to cost-efficiently and effectively alert drivers of railroad crossings and to promote safer driving habits. To best utilize this in-vehicle technology, 32 auditory warnings (16 verbal, 7 train-related auditory icons, and 9 generic earcons) were generated and presented to 31 participants after a brief low-fidelity driving simulation. Participants rated each sound on eight dimensions deemed important in previous auditory warning literature. Preliminary results and possible interpretations are discussed...|$|E
40|$|As the {{interface}} between roads and train lines, railway level crossings are the potential site for <b>vehicle-train</b> collisions. Due {{to the lack of}} financial viability in solely approaching this issue from an engineering perspective, there is increased interest in a human factors perspective. This chapter will outline the findings from preliminary research conducted as part of a three-year study of motorist behaviour at railway level crossings in Australia. In-depth interviews were undertaken with 122 participants from the at-risk road user groups of: heavy vehicles; older drivers and younger drivers. Risk behaviours and attitudes were found to differ between sub groups and by setting which has strong implications for the design of educational interventions to improve motorist safety at level crossings...|$|E
40|$|Railway level {{crossings}} are {{the interface between}} roads and train lines, and as such are the potential site for <b>vehicle-train</b> collisions and incidents. Of all road crash types, those between motor vehicles and trains are amongst the most severe. However, research into motorist safety at {{level crossings}} is currently very limited in Australia, despite 74 fatalities due to collisions between trains and motor vehicles at level crossings from 1997 to 2002. In Queensland, there were 230 reported crashes from 1997 to 2001. Train Drivers are first-hand witnesses to numerous incidents that occur between road users and trains at railway level crossings. This exploratory study utilised focus group discussions to investigate Train Driver experience of motorist behaviour at railway level crossings. Observed motorist behaviour, "near misses", "incidents" and reporting issues were investigated. Analysis of focus group data was used {{to assist in the}} identification of high risk road user groups specific to the issue of railway level crossing safety, and associated high risk driving behaviours...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this proposed study is to utilize FRA crash database to evaluate safety effectiveness of stop-sign treatment on public highway-railroad grade crossings. Engineers and policy makers who make decisions about traffic control posting configurations are not in complete agreement if stop signs are effective when used at highway-railroad grade crossings. Using the Federal Railroad Administration database, an overall analysis of effectiveness of stop-sign treatment at highway-railroad grade crossings is proposed to be conducted. This proposed study will focus on a before-and-after and cross-sectional statistical analysis of crash history at public highway-railroad grade crossings that were upgraded from Crossbuck-only to stop signs without using other TCDs or automatic countermeasures. Specifically, the objectives of this research are to: 1) determine if the stop-sign treatment {{can lead to a}} lower <b>vehicle-train</b> accident frequency after stop controls were implemented at passive grade crossings, and 2) utilize negative binomial regression model to analyze and predict how specific risk changes may be expected afte...|$|E
40|$|Heavy <b>vehicle-train</b> {{collisions}} {{have the}} potential to be catastrophic in terms of fatalities, environmental disaster, delays in the rail network, and extensive damage to property. Heavy vehicles, such as 'Road Trains' and 'B-Doubles', are vulnerable road users due to their size and mass and require specific risk management solutions. The present study aimed to capture the experiences of heavy vehicle drivers and train drivers at road-rail level crossings, with a view to exploring the contributing factors toward such accidents. A series of semi-structured focus groups were conducted, with a total of 17 train drivers and 26 heavy vehicle drivers taking part. Though there were some differences between the groups in perceptions of the causes of heavy vehicle level crossing incidents, discussion in both groups centred on design issues and behavioural issues. With regard to design, the configuration of level crossings was found to affect heavy vehicle driver visibility and effective vehicle clearance. With regard to behaviour, discussion centred around wilful violation of crossing protocols, often as a time-saving measure, as well as driver complacency due to high levels of familiarity. The implications of these factors for future level crossing safety initiatives are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{three main}} {{requirements}} of a vehicle-trailer connection system are: en route stability, over- or under-steering restraint, minimum off-tracking along curved path. Linking the two units by four-bar trapeziums, wider stability margins may be attained {{in comparison with the}} conventional pintle-hitch for both instability types, divergent or oscillating. The stability maps are traced applying the Hurwitz method or the direct analysis of the characteristic equation at the instability threshold. Several types of four-bar linkages may be quickly tested, with the drawbars converging towards the trailer or the towing unit. The latter configuration appears preferable in terms of self-stability and may yield high critical speeds by optimising the geometrical and physical properties. Nevertheless, the system stability may be improved in general by additional vibration dampers in parallel with the connection linkage. Moreover, the four-bar connection may produce significant corrections of the under-steering or over-steering behaviour of the <b>vehicle-train</b> after a steering command from the driver. The offtracking along the curved paths may be also optimized or kept inside prefixed margins of acceptableness. Activating electronic stability systems if necessary, fair results are obtainable for both the steering conduct and the off-tracking...|$|E
40|$|Intersections {{handling}} a high {{volume of traffic}} and pedestrians (and possibly railroads) limit {{the capacity of the}} approaching roads. Grade-separating these conflict points allow an uninterrupted flow of traffic while also eliminating the safety threat posed by trains, pedestrians, or other vehicles. Three primary roadway improvement objectives are accomplished using grade separated intersections: � Increased capacity and uninterrupted flow. � Increased safety. � Reduced <b>vehicle-train</b> conflict and delay. Overpasses increase the capacity of a roadway by allowing uninterrupted flow in all directions. The intersection approaches do not come in direct contact but rather bypass each other. Fewer signals are required to direct traffic, eliminating the queues caused by signals. Grade separation increases roadway safety by reducing the vehicle-vehicle and vehiclepedestrian conflicts. The crossing traffic is removed from the intersection, thus eliminating the possibility of collisions between those streams of vehicles. Pedestrians are given greater protection from cars, as there will be only one line of traffic to cross and more refuge points can be provided at multiple locations. Removing at-grade intersections with railroads substantially increases speed for both trains and cars. Street traffic moves freely over or under railroad tracks, reducing wait times for a passing train and increasing travel speed and capacity of the roadway. Most importantly, the incidence rate of train-vehicle collisions is eliminated as the intersection no longer puts traffic in front of trains...|$|E
40|$|Preemption {{of traffic}} signal {{controllers}} near railroad grade crossings equipped with active warning devices is often required because queues from the intersection can extend {{back over the}} tracks, thereby creating {{the potential for a}} serious <b>vehicle-train</b> accident. Current textbooks, manuals and other references contain minimal information regarding preemption timing and design. ’ ” The {{purpose of this article is}} to present guidelines for determining when a preemption capability is required at isolated intersections, and for calculating the duration of the preemption timing intervals. Need for Preemption One of the fundamental issues involved in preemption design is determining the need for preemption. One of the few quantitative statements concerning preemption in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) suggests that preemption be installed when a signalized intersection is located within 200 feet (ft) of a railroad grade crossing. ?There is, however. no explanation as to how this figure was derived. Whatever the rationale. the current recommendation does not recognize that in some cases it may be appropriate to install preemption at an intersection that is more than 200 ” ft from a set of tracks because of prevailing queuing characteristics. The queue length expected during any signal cycle will be a function of the approach Volume. cycle length, saturation flow rate and the effective green interval. If the highway traffic signal is already present. queue lengths can simply be measured in the field. However, because a decision to use preemption will most likely need to be made before the signal is installed, it will often be necessary to estimate expected queue lengths with some type of traffic flow model. Although the signalized intersection capacity analysis procedures in the ffi~hwwy Capuciry A 4 anaa / (HCM) provide for the calculation of maximum discharge rates, they do not include a method for estimating storage requirements to preclude spillback into adjacent lanes or upstream intersections, ’ A simple yet practical method for doing this is to apply a macroscopic “continuum” model that assumes constant arrival and discharge flow rates. ’ For unsaturated conditions, the time in seconds necessary to discharge a queue of vehicles is given by: ~=q(c–g) s–...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of grade crossing safety has long focused on <b>vehicle-train</b> crashes using statistical models based on crash data. The potential crashes generated by vehicle-vehicle rear-end conflicts {{have often been}} ignored. The interaction of different traffic attributes on safety performance of a grade crossing is also not well-understood. The primary objective of this thesis is to model the causal relationship of vehicle-vehicle interactions by developing the operation logic of gate-equipped grade crossing using a commercially available microscopic simulation package that models human driver behaviors. The simulation-generated vehicle trajectory data allows detail safety performance analysis on vehicle-vehicle interaction over time as they approach the track. A dual-gate equipped crossing at Kitchener, Ontario is selected as the study area. Initially, logic modifications are made to the simulation package (VISSIM) in order to accurately model the grade crossing segment. A two-step calibration is used in this thesis. Firstly, model input parameters for a signalized intersection from literature are used to model typical car-following behavior along this type of roadway. Secondly, parameters used to model drivers’ decision and reaction when approaching crossing is fine tuned through data collection and calibration. After incorporating all the modifications to the simulation package, validation is undertaken by comparing model-generated speed profiles to on-site observed speed profile. The established model is tested for its safety performance sensitivity through varying three traffic attributes in the simulation: (i) percentage of bus, (ii) total traffic volume, (iii) percentage of cars in the center lane of a 2 -lane approach. Four safety performance measures were selected. The overall {{results indicate that the}} established model is functional and reliable in modeling grade crossing vehicles interactions at gated crossings. In the absence of a train, vehicles’ reduction in speed in the vicinity of a crossing results in traffic flow turbulence that increases the opportunity for high risk rear-end vehicle interactions. The sensitivity test revealed that the spillback behavior of vehicles due to the stopping behaviors of buses increases risk in the upstream section. Also, overloading of vehicles into the network indeed improves safety as the effect of differential speed diminishes. Among the four selected safety performance measures, DRAC seems to reflect problems with rear-end vehicle interactions in the vicinity of a crossing {{as a function of the}} traffic attributes considered in this research...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{character}} of the original source materials and the nature of batch digitization, quality control issues may be present in this document. Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Priority or hazard indices are used by the states to rank their rail-highway intersections according to relative hazard to aid in locating crossings for treatment of conditions and/or improvements in warning devices. The Texas Priority Index has been effective over the years in identifying particularly hazardous rail-highway intersections based on high vehicle volumes, train volumes, and accident histories, and these crossings have been treated or improved. Many of the remaining crossings, however, are not well discriminated in terms of their need for improvement; many crossings have the same index number. The objective of this research was to evaluate sight distance as a criterion for prioritizing rail-highway intersections in Texas to help distinguish between the crossings with similar or identical priority index numbers. Accident and sight distance data were compiled and analyzed. A sight distance variable was incorporated into the current Texas Priority Index and evaluated for its effects on the overall ranking of the rail-highway intersections. A state hazard index was chosen from a state-of-the-practice review with which to compare the current and revised Texas Priority Indices. Finally, the effectiveness of each of the indices was predicted in terms of the distribution of priority index numbers and their ability to move the most potentially hazardous crossings up in the rankings. It was concluded from the accident analysis that sight distance contributed to more <b>vehicle-train</b> accidents than any other factor. Further, improvements to warning devices at passive crossings would effectively reduce the overall sight obstruction, reduce the number of train involved accidents, and thus, reduce the number of injuries and fatalities resulting from accidents at rail-highway intersections. It was concluded from the field data analysis that the Method 1 revised Texas Priority Index was the most effective index of the four priority indices evaluated in this thesis for ranking crossings in terms of exposure, accident history, sight distance, and protection type. The Method 1 revised index was effective at redistributing the individual index numbers in the rank and identifying crossings with restricted sight distance while conserving the significance of the exposure values...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. With the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement Act, there is quite a potential for an increase in rail traffic in the state of Texas. Despite the fact that the number of <b>vehicle-train</b> collisions that occurred decreased 47 percent between 1981 and 1992, safety at highway-railroad grade crossings is still a major concern. This thesis investigates modifications to the existing advance warning sign used at highway-railroad grade crossings. A literature review was conducted to find supporting information that explains the importance of this research relative to other research being conducted in the area of railroad grade crossing safety. The background and supporting information includes information on highway-railroad grade crossings, driver behavior at highway-railroad grade crossings, and effectiveness of traffic control devices that have supplemented the standard signing system with strobe lights. The objective of this research was to determine if the addition of a strobe light to an advance warning preceding a passive railroad crossing would result in adverse driver reactions such as slamming on the brakes or erratic steering maneuvers. Approaching motor vehicles detected by a motion sensor activate a strobe light which flashed until the vehicle passed the advance warning sign. The modified sign system was tested at a closed driving course at the Texas A&M University Riverside Campus. In addition to the driving test, study participants completed a questionnaire and participated in a group discussion to determine their opinions of the three signs they saw on the driving course: the standard advance warning sign, the advance warning sign modified with a standard flasher and an the advance warning sign modified with a vehicle activated strobe light. None of the three signs, including the strobe modified sign, resulted in any adverse driver reactions. The strobe light and flasher modified signs did, however, solicit more braking than did the standard sign. Head movement at each of the three signs was not found to be statistically different. Participants clearly preferred the standard flasher modification to the strobe light. Furthermore, the strobe light sign was preferred over the standard sign. Both the strobe fight and the standard flasher were said to have better attention gaining qualities than the standard sign that made drivers exercise greater caution near them. While some drivers simply did not like the strobe light, only three subjects said it startled them. Most of the startling that they experienced was attributed to the novelty of the strobe {{and the fact that they}} were trying to determine what was flashing with such an irregular pattern...|$|E
