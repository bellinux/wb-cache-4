5000|$|Commonly {{known in}} Germany, and {{particularly}} in the field of passive fire protection, as [...] "TU Braunschweig", its iBMB Institute has been accredited by the German Institute for Building Technology (Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik) and has, for decades, performed public testing for the purpose of establishing fire-resistance ratings of products and systems for manufacturers. iBMB also assists the DIBt in third-party <b>vendor</b> <b>inspections</b> (product certification) and quality control testing, in an effort to maintain DIBt approvals. iBMB was also instrumental in leading the Eureka project, which has become a guideline for building codes and regulations governing fire protection measures for traffic tunnels.|$|R
50|$|The Plaintiffs {{eventually}} obtained {{an order}} directing {{each of the}} Corcoran Defendants to produce their respective hard drives to an independent <b>vendor</b> for <b>inspection</b> and deleted file recovery and for a keyword search of terms be conducted for extraction and production. The Corcoran Defendants eventually produced two hard drives ("Hard Drives") which they say are an exact replica of the central server {{in connection with the}} persons in question as all Corcoran e-mails are forwarded to a central server.|$|R
5000|$|Total {{estimated}} costs of project are €900 million, including €630 {{million for the}} offshore section. [...] The Algerian onshore section of the pipeline is to be constructed by UTE Initec - Spie Capag and the offshore section is to be constructed by Saipem. [...] The offshore section of the pipeline was laid by Castoro Sei, Saipem 7000 and Crawler pipe-laying ships. [...] Steel pipes are delivered by Nippon Steel, and three compressor trains were supplied by Dresser-Rand. [...] Lloyd's Register would provide pipeline inspection and certification services, including <b>vendor</b> works <b>inspection</b> for the pipeline and equipment and certification for the onshore and offshore pipe lay {{and the construction of}} the compressor station.|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} {{is focused on}} mapping of mechanical properties using methods of non-destructive structuroscopy of cast irons, which {{are a result of}} research at TU of Liberec and Institute of Physics of ASCR. Investigated samples become from melts of FOCAM s. r. o Olomouc Foundry shop. It compares data of mechanical properties obtained using ultrasound method with data from magnetic spot method and MAT. These are interpreted by mathematic models applicable in practice. In the following it concerns to derivation of loading tensile curve method, which can be used to obtain yield and fatigue strength limits even for cast irons with flake graphite. In spite of promising results reported by literature the experiments are bothered with error. This method can be applied to structure checking both before casting and at <b>vendor</b> <b>inspection</b> of castings...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{premise of}} the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing and inspection program is that licensees {{are responsible for the}} proper construction and safe and efficient operation of their nuclear power plants. The Federal government and nuclear industry have established a system for the inspection of commercial nuclear facilities to provide for multiple levels of inspection and verification. Each licensee, contractor, and vendor participates in a quality verification process in compliance with requirements prescribed by the NRC`s rules and regulations (Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations). The NRC does inspections to oversee the commercial nuclear industry to determine whether its requirements are being met by licensees and their contractors, while the major inspection effort is performed by the industry within the framework of quality verification programs. This periodical covers the results if inspections that were performed by the NRC`s Special Inspection Branch, <b>Vendor</b> <b>Inspection</b> Section, and that were distributed to the inspected organizations during the period from July through September 1997...|$|E
50|$|ISO 9000 and Z299 {{standards}} have many similar requirements. One {{of the main}} differences between them is that Z299 requires Inspection and Test Plans to be submitted to the purchaser by the <b>vendor,</b> and independent <b>inspection</b> and testing. The Inspection and Test Plan details key inspections and tests at certain points in the production process, and is meant to complement a generic quality program by providing detail on the requirements of a specific product.|$|R

40|$|Many health {{sciences}} libraries are {{now considering}} integrated automated systems for {{an investment of}} several hundred thousand dollars. The request for proposals (RFPs) is the usual method of selecting candidate <b>vendors</b> for close <b>inspection</b> of promising systems. This paper draws upon {{the experience of the}} Library of Rush University and that of twelve other health sciences libraries. The libraries were interviewed by telephone using a short questionnaire that asked them to compare the RFPs with the systems actually obtained and their experiences in implementing them. The libraries were also asked, with the benefit of hindsight, what would they have done differently. Four vendors were also interviewed by telephone, in order to get their point of view...|$|R
40|$|Researchers at NASA/GSFC {{evaluated}} various automated inspection systems (AIS) technologies using test boards {{with known}} defects in surface mount solder joints. These boards were complex and included almost {{every type of}} surface mount device typical of critical assemblies used for space flight applications: X-ray radiography; X-ray laminography; Ultrasonic Imaging; Optical Imaging; Laser Imaging; and Infrared <b>Inspection.</b> <b>Vendors,</b> representative of the different technologies, inspected the test boards with their particular machine. The results of the evaluation showed limitations of AIS. Furthermore, none of the AIS technologies evaluated proved to meet all of the inspection criteria for use in high-reliability applications. It was found that certain inspection systems could supplement but not replace manual inspection for low-volume, high-reliability, surface mount solder joints...|$|R
