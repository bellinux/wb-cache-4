5|$|Hardy, {{along with}} his brother Jeff and friends, started their own federation, the Trampoline Wrestling Federation (TWF) and mimicked the moves they saw on television. Shortly after Hardy sent in a tape for the World Championship Wrestling (WCW) Amateur Challenge using the ring name High <b>Voltage,</b> a tag team named High <b>Voltage</b> began {{competing}} in WCW, causing Hardy to change his name to Surge. A few years later, it was revealed to him by Chris Kanyon that the tape had been kept in the WCW Power Plant, watched multiple times, and that the name High <b>Voltage</b> was blatantly stolen from it. Beginning in 1994, The Hardys wrestled for several North Carolina-based independent circuit promotions and adapted a number of alter-egos. As The Wolverine, Hardy captured the New England Wrestling Alliance (NEWA) Championship in May 1994. As High <b>Voltage,</b> he teamed with Venom to claim the New Frontier Wrestling Association (NFWA) Tag Team Championship in March 1995. A month later, High <b>Voltage</b> defeated the Willow for the NFWA Championship.|$|E
5|$|In a wind farm, {{individual}} turbines are interconnected with {{a medium}} <b>voltage</b> (often 34.5 kV), {{power collection system}} and communications network.

5|$|The {{earliest}} electrical {{application of}} SiC was in lightning arresters in electric power systems.

The <b>voltage</b> across the resistor is amplified for performance or recording. In most cases, the electronics in the microphone itself contribute no <b>voltage</b> gain as the <b>voltage</b> differential is quite significant, up to several volts for high sound levels.

Very long filaments for high <b>voltages</b> are fragile, and lamp bases become more difficult to insulate, so lamps for illumination are not made with rated <b>voltages</b> over 300 volts.
