5|$|Skanderbeg {{instructed}} {{his troops}} {{on what to}} expect and opened battle by ordering a force of archers to open fire on the <b>Venetian</b> line. Soon, the Albanian right wing advanced to engage first and managed to push the <b>Venetian</b> left wing back, while {{the center and the}} right engaged the <b>Venetian</b> center and left. The breakthrough was soon accomplished by attacking the gaps in the <b>Venetian</b> lines, causing disorder among their ranks. The battle continued for hours until large groups of <b>Venetian</b> troops began to flee. Skanderbeg, seeing his fleeing adversaries, ordered a full-scale offensive, routing the entire <b>Venetian</b> army. The Republic's soldiers were chased right to the gates of Scutari, and <b>Venetian</b> prisoners were thereafter paraded outside the fortress.|$|E
5|$|However, the League of Lezhë {{defeated}} {{both the}} <b>Venetian</b> {{forces and the}} Ottoman expedition. The League won over the <b>Venetian</b> forces on 23 July 1448 {{at the gates of}} Scutari, and over the Ottomans three weeks later, on 14 August 1448, at the Battle of Oronichea. The Republic was, thereafter, left with few soldiers to defend <b>Venetian</b> Albania. As a result, the League soon signed peace with the Republic of Venice, while continuing the war against the Ottoman Empire. After the Albanian–Venetian War of 1447–1448, Venice did not seriously challenge Skanderbeg or the League, allowing Skanderbeg to focus his campaigns against the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|On 13 February 1386 Corfu became {{once more}} a <b>Venetian</b> {{possession}} {{and this time}} <b>Venetian</b> rule would last {{until the end of}} the Republic. This was accomplished voluntary by the people of Corfu. On 10 May, the Corfiotes appointed five ambassadors to submit to the <b>Venetian</b> senate. The Ottomans made several attempts to capture Corfu, the first of which was in 1537. This attack led Venice to an alliance with the Pope and Emperor Charles V, known as the Holy League, against the Ottoman Empire. Another major unsuccessful Ottoman attack was that of July 1716.|$|E

50|$|In 1479, Turkish forces {{reached the}} islands {{and many of}} the people fled from the island out of fear of the new Turkish settlers. Those that {{remained}} hid in the mountains to avoid the pirates who controlled the channel between Cephalonia and Ithaca and the bays of the island. In the following five years, the Turks, Toques and <b>Venetians</b> laid claim to the islands diplomatically. Possession of the islands was finally taken by the Ottoman Empire from 1484 to 1499. During this period, the <b>Venetians</b> had strengthened into a major power with an organized fleet. The <b>Venetians</b> pursued their interest in the Ionian Islands, and in 1499 a war between the <b>Venetians</b> and the Turks began. The allied fleets of the <b>Venetians</b> and the Spanish besieged Ithaca, and the other islands. The fleets prevailed, and from 1500 onwards the <b>Venetians</b> controlled the islands. According to a treaty of 1503, Ithaca, Cephalonia and Zakynthos would be ruled by the <b>Venetians,</b> and Lefkada by the Turks. By then Ithaca was almost uninhabited, and the <b>Venetians</b> had to grant incentives to settlers from neighbouring islands and the mainland to repopulate it.|$|R
50|$|In 1715, the Ottomans {{attacked}} the Peloponnese {{and managed to}} drive out the <b>Venetians</b> within seventy days. The <b>Venetians</b> won some minor naval battles off Mani but abandoned the Peloponnese in 1715. The next year, the Treaty of Passarowitz was signed, and the <b>Venetians</b> abandoned their claim to the Peloponnese.|$|R
5|$|The Albanians {{managed to}} inflict 2,500 {{casualties}} on the <b>Venetian</b> force, capturing 1,000. Skanderbeg's army suffered 400 casualties, most {{on the right}} wing. The <b>Venetian</b> presence in Albania was weakened and the garrisons in the cities were stretched thin.|$|E
5|$|The {{currency}} {{of the islands}} during <b>Venetian</b> rule was the <b>Venetian</b> lira, as in Venice. There was a special issue for the Islands; the observe side of it has the complete or shertened inscription CORFU/CEFALONIA/ZANTE in three lines. The reserve depicts the winged and haloed lion of Saint Marc in a front view, holding {{the book of the}} Gospel in his fore-paws. The Ionian Islands formed part of the <b>Venetian</b> maritime trade route to the Orient.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>Venetian</b> {{operation}} {{was an attempt}} to blockade the Dardanelles in 1646. To interdict the supplies headed to the Ottoman forces in Crete, a force of 23 <b>Venetian</b> ships under Tommaso Morosini scoured the Aegean for Ottoman shipping, and attempted to capture the strategically important island of Tenedos at the entrance of the Dardanelles. The Kapudan Pasha Koca Musa led a fleet of 80 warships against the Venetians, but his fleet was driven back into the Dardanelles on 26 May. However, the blockading fleet was unable to stop the next exit of the Ottoman fleet on 4 June, when the lack of wind enabled the Ottoman galleys to evade the <b>Venetian</b> sailing ships. The Ottomans were thus able to land new troops and supplies on Crete unopposed. The efforts of the <b>Venetian</b> fleet to counter the Ottoman land operations in Crete likewise failed, through a combination of timidity on behalf of their commanders, the delays in payment for the crews, and the effects of a widespread plague.|$|E
5|$|While his envoys {{negotiated}} in Italy, Louis marched to Dalmatia to relieve Zadar, but the <b>Venetians</b> bribed his commanders. When the citizens broke out and attacked the besiegers on 1 July, the royal army failed to intervene, and the <b>Venetians</b> overcame the defenders outside {{the walls of}} the town. Louis withdrew but refused to renounce Dalmatia, although the <b>Venetians</b> offered to pay 320,000 golden florins as compensation. Lacking military support from Louis, however, Zadar surrendered to the <b>Venetians</b> on 21 December 1346.|$|R
50|$|On 14 June the <b>Venetians</b> {{were between}} Lemnos and Mount Athos, with the Ottoman fleet to the NNW. The <b>Venetians</b> sailed westward, the Ottoman fleet eastward.|$|R
50|$|In 1770, the <b>Venetians,</b> {{an ally of}} the Ottoman Empire, sent a 10,000-strong {{force to}} Dubrovnik to fight Šćepan Mali. The armies met at Kotor. The <b>Venetians</b> {{suffered}} 500 wounded and some 350 killed, and the Montenegrins officially won with much lower casualties. The retreat of the <b>Venetians</b> was secured by Šćepan himself for 10,000 gold coins paid by the <b>Venetians</b> and the surrender of all their weapons and four cannons. This {{was the only time}} Montenegro used westernized tactics of warfare (e.g. line infantry and such) in the 18th century.|$|R
5|$|A <b>Venetian</b> confidant on Hvar reported, in 1498, the Ottoman {{preparation}} of 25 ships for sea attack on Krajina and Kačićs. In the next year, they became Ottoman subjects. In 1500, the Split monarch reported to Venice that Ottomans captured several delegates from Split, and that safely arrived in Mostar only thanks to knez Juraj Marković, an Ottoman subject and <b>Venetian</b> friend. Marković wrote from Makarska to Venice {{that he was}} knez for 15 years and always {{a friend of the}} Venetians. In the Marković collection and archive, D. Papalić found the Croatian redaction of the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja.|$|E

50|$|The {{conflict}} {{was named the}} War of Chioggia because the <b>Venetians,</b> after an initial success, were defeated in Pula by the Genoese, who occupied Chioggia and besieged Venice. The <b>Venetians</b> established a new fleet and besieged the Genoese in Chioggia in turn, forcing them to surrender in 1380. The war ended in favour of the <b>Venetians</b> with the Peace of Turin on 8 April 1381.|$|R
50|$|According to a February 2014 poll by Ixè, in a hypotethical {{referendum}} on independence, 47% of <b>Venetians</b> would vote yes and 26% no. According to a March 2014 poll by Ilvo Diamanti's Demos&Pi, 55% of <b>Venetians</b> favoured independence, 39% opposed {{it and the}} remaining 6% did not answer. According to a similar poll conducted right after by Istituto Piepoli, 64% of <b>Venetians</b> would vote in favour of more autonomy with 19% against, and 51% would vote for independence with 32% against. According to a Demos&Pi poll taken in October 2014, 53% of <b>Venetians</b> favoured independence, thus making Veneto the most separatist region in Italy, followed by Sardinia (45%) and Sicily (44%). In March 2015 Demos&Pi found that 57% of <b>Venetians</b> (including 83% of Liga Veneta-Lega Nord's voters) favoured independence.|$|R
5|$|Although Etty had {{traditionally}} {{worked in}} the <b>Venetian</b> style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from <b>Venetian</b> styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, {{and closer to the}} style of Titian. This is likely owing {{to the nature of the}} subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology, and took place in brightly lit Mediterranean settings. The Seasons, by contrast, was seen as an explicitly English work, requiring a more muted palette to deal with the typical lighting conditions of Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|As {{the power}} and {{reputation}} of Pietro II grew, the <b>Venetian</b> people {{began to wonder if}} he was secretly planning to establish a hereditary monarchy. Their fears were confirmed when his son, Otto Orseolo (named after Otto III), assumed the title of Doge upon Pietro II's death in 1009, thereby becoming the youngest Doge in <b>Venetian</b> history at the age of 16. Scandal marked much of Otto's reign as he showed a clear inclination toward nepotism by elevating several relatives to positions of power. In 1026, he was deposed by his enemies and exiled to Constantinople, but his successor, Pietro Barbolano, had such difficulty in attempting to unite the city that it seemed infighting would once again seize Venice.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Selvo's rule, he took over responsibility for the third construction of St. Mark's Basilica. This final and most famous version of the church, whose construction was begun by Domenico Contarini and finished by Vitale Faliero in 1094, remains an important symbol of the long periods of medieval <b>Venetian</b> wealth and power. The church is also {{a monument to the}} great Byzantine influence on <b>Venetian</b> art and culture throughout its history, but particularly in the 11th century. Though Selvo did not oversee {{the beginning}} or completion of St Mark's Basilica, his rule covered a longer period of its construction than the other two Doges who oversaw the project.|$|E
5|$|In 1232, <b>Venetians</b> {{mentioned}} that Dubrovnik {{was not allowed}} to accept Kačićs and Omišani, and if Venice were to send ships against Kačićs, Dubrovnik must join the <b>Venetians</b> with a ship of at least 50 people.|$|R
50|$|On 25 August the <b>Venetians</b> {{captured}} some Ottoman galleys, then discipline {{broke down}} and the Ottomans recaptured the vessels while they were being looted; the French reinforcements abandoned the <b>Venetians</b> in disgust and fled to Rhodes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Venetians</b> Movement (Movimento Veneti) is an Venetist separatist cross-party {{political}} movement {{which aims to}} promote independence regardless of individual political positions such as left or right, in a democratic and nonviolent way. The complete name of the movement, which was founded on 26 November 2006 in Padua, is <b>Venetians</b> Movement for the Independence of Venetia (Movimento Veneti par ła Indipendensa de ła Venetia), but it is commonly known also as The <b>Venetians</b> (I Veneti).|$|R
5|$|Before {{the age of}} the bucentaurs, it is {{probable}} that for ceremonies in the <b>Venetian</b> Lagoon the doge was simply assigned a small galley from the <b>Venetian</b> fleet. As Venice's wealth increased due to its naval power, plans were made for a special ship to be built. This is evidenced by the promissioni – sacramental pledges spoken by the doges when they were sworn into office – of Reniero Zeno of 1252, Lorenzo Tiepolo of 1268 and Giovanni Soranzo of 1312 which mention the construction of a bucentaur in the Arsenale shipyard and naval depot.|$|E
5|$|Between 1580 and 1600 Jan Zamoyski {{commissioned}} the <b>Venetian</b> architect Bernardo Morando {{to build the}} city of Zamość. The town and its fortifications were designed to consistently implement the Renaissance and Mannerism aesthetic paradigms.|$|E
5|$|Between January {{and the end}} of April 1684, the Republic of Venice {{accepted}} 4,200 {{families as}} settlers on the Venetian–Ottoman frontier, including 20,000 warriors. The Venetians provided them with food and 1,800 rifles, and their leaders were given monthly pay. The families were settled in the territory of Zadar and Šibenik, and around Klis. Pivljanin and his brother Dimitrije served in the cavalry bands in Zadar until Antonio Zeno, the extraordinary provveditore of Kotor, requested that they be sent for service in the Bay of Kotor. This was approved by Lorenzo Donà, the provveditore of Dalmatia, on 12April 1684. In September 1684 Pivljanin was documented as having been with his band in Herceg Novi, and in October in the area of Livno. The <b>Venetian</b> Senate thanked Pivljanin and Jovan Sikimić for their victory at Jezero, and approved Zeno's decision to reward them medals and sequins, on 12October 1684. Marino Mikiel, a <b>Venetian</b> commissary, writing {{of the state of the}} <b>Venetian</b> cavalry in Dalmatia on 26January 1685, highlighted that Stojan Janković and Pivljanin received the wages of cavalry soldiers due to their merit and by grace of the state, without having to effectively serve as soldiers. In March 1685 Pivljanin informed the <b>Venetian</b> extraordinary provveditore about his band's operations in the territory of the Republic of Ragusa; his band numbered 130 fighters and had three harambašas: Miho Kolumbara; Miloš Lepirić; and Božo Lučić. In February, they had captured a caravan with wheat in Zupci, stolen some cattle and burnt down the village of Glavska, attacked Cavtat and returned to Trebinje.|$|E
50|$|After {{an initial}} {{attack by the}} <b>Venetians,</b> which inflicted severe destruction, Caterina's army managed to outmanoeuvre them. Afterwards, the war {{continued}} with minor skirmishes until the <b>Venetians</b> were able to circumvent Forlì to reach Florence by another route.|$|R
50|$|In 1447, Skanderbeg demanded {{from the}} <b>Venetians</b> to give control over Drivast to him, {{along with the}} lands which earlier belonged to Lekë Zakarija. However, the <b>Venetians</b> refused to accept his demands and Skanderbeg started the war against Venice.|$|R
50|$|Cyprus {{was sold}} in 1489 to Venice by the Cypriot Queen Catherine Cornaro. The <b>Venetians</b> did not have Cyprus' best {{interest}} at heart, they were only interested in receiving the taxes and in exploiting the country’s resources. The <b>Venetians</b> strengthened the Castle of Limassol.|$|R
5|$|By early 1570, the Ottoman {{preparations}} and {{the warnings}} {{sent by the}} <b>Venetian</b> bailo at Constantinople, Marco Antonio Barbaro, had convinced the Signoria that war was imminent. Reinforcements and money were sent post-haste to Crete and Cyprus. In March 1570, an Ottoman envoy was sent to Venice, bearing an ultimatum that demanded the immediate cession of Cyprus. Although some voices were raised in the <b>Venetian</b> Signoria advocating the cession of the island in exchange for land in Dalmatia and further trading privileges, the hope of assistance from the other Christian states stiffened the Republic's resolve, and the ultimatum was categorically rejected.|$|E
5|$|For 1654, the Ottomans marshaled their strength: the Arsenal (Tersâne-i Âmire) in the Golden Horn {{produced}} new warships, and squadrons from Tripolitania and Tunis {{arrived to}} strengthen the Ottoman fleet. The strengthened Ottoman fleet that sailed forth from the Dardanelles in early May numbered 79 ships (40 sailing ships, 33 galleys and 6 galleasses), and further 22 galleys from around the Aegean and 14 ships from Barbary stood by to reinforce it off the Straits. This force considerably outnumbered the 26 ships of the <b>Venetian</b> blockade fleet under Giuseppe Dolfin. Although the battle that followed resulted in an Ottoman victory, for the Venetians, given the successful escape of their fleet from the superior Ottoman force, coupled with reports of large Ottomans casualties and the great bravery displayed by the <b>Venetian</b> crews, it counted as a moral victory. The Ottoman fleet, now reinforced by the Aegean and Barbary squadrons, plundered the <b>Venetian</b> island of Tinos, but retreated after only a brief skirmish with the Venetians under Alvise Mocenigo on 21 June. Kara Murad Pasha succeeded in evading the Venetians {{for the remainder of}} the year, with both fleets sailing back and forth in the Aegean, before returning to the Dardanelles in September due to agitation among the fleet's Janissaries. The final months of 1654 were marked by a significant change in the <b>Venetian</b> leadership: Mocenigo died at Candia, and was succeeded as acting Captain General of the Sea by Francesco Morosini, who had distinguished himself in the previous battles.|$|E
5|$|His father, Niccolò Polo, a merchant, traded {{with the}} Near East, {{becoming}} wealthy and achieving great prestige. Niccolò {{and his brother}} Maffeo set off on a trading voyage before Marco's birth. In 1260, Niccolò and Maffeo, while residing in Constantinople, then {{the capital of the}} Latin Empire, foresaw a political change; they liquidated their assets into jewels and moved away. According to The Travels of Marco Polo, they passed through much of Asia, and met with Kublai Khan, a Mongol ruler and founder of the Yuan dynasty. Their decision to leave Constantinople proved timely. In 1261 Michael VIII Palaiologos, the ruler of the Empire of Nicaea, took Constantinople, promptly burned the <b>Venetian</b> quarter and re-established the Eastern Roman Empire. Captured <b>Venetian</b> citizens were blinded, while many of those who managed to escape perished aboard overloaded refugee ships fleeing to other <b>Venetian</b> colonies in the Aegean Sea.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Venetians</b> {{occupied}} {{the area in}} 1207. In 1571 an Ottoman military force landed at Souda and caused major destruction in the Chania area. The <b>Venetians</b> fortified Souda Island between 1570 and 1573, {{in order to protect}} the area from Ottoman raiders and pirates. However, Souda Bay remained a pirate infested area during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The <b>Venetians</b> managed to hold on to the strategic islands within Souda Bay until 1715, over thirty years after the fall of Crete to the Ottomans.|$|R
50|$|The Genoese then {{approached}} Michael VIII Palaiologos, Emperor of Nicaea. After the Treaty of Nymphaeum was ratified in 1261, {{the emperor}} funded fifty ships {{to fight the}} <b>Venetians.</b> After this assault, in 1264, the <b>Venetians</b> returned to Tyre to conquer it, but backed out when Tyre received reinforcements.|$|R
50|$|The Ottoman Empire {{captured}} Isthmia in 1423, and permamently in 1458. Isthmia {{was fought}} {{over by the}} Turks, <b>Venetians,</b> and local potentates for over three centuries.
