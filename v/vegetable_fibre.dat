Cotton being a <b>vegetable</b> <b>fibre</b> will be bleached using an oxidizing agent, such as dilute sodium hypochlorite or dilute hydrogen peroxide. If the fabric is to be dyed a deep shade, then lower levels of bleaching are acceptable, for example. However, for white bed sheetings and medical applications, the highest levels of whiteness and absorbency are essential.|$|E
25|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} a disease of old age: It {{typically}} originates in the secretory cells lining the gut, and risk factors include diets low in <b>vegetable</b> <b>fibre</b> and high in fat. If a younger person gets such a cancer, it {{is often associated with}} hereditary syndromes like Peutz-Jegher's, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or familial adenomatous polyposis. Colorectal cancer can be detected through the bleeding of a polyp, colicky bowel pain, a bowel obstruction or the biopsy of a polyp at a screening colonoscopy. A constant feeling of having to go to the toilet or anemia might also point to this kind of cancer.|$|E
60|$|The chemist {{must answer}} that. And {{he tells us}} that wood can become lignite, or wood-coal, by parting with its oxygen, {{in the shape of}} {{carbonic}} acid gas, or choke-damp; and then common or bituminous coal, by parting with its hydrogen, chiefly in the form of carburetted hydrogen--the gas with which we light our streets. That is about as much as the unscientific reader need know. But it is a fresh corroboration of the theory that coal has been once <b>vegetable</b> <b>fibre,</b> for it shows how <b>vegetable</b> <b>fibre</b> can, by the laws of nature, become coal. And it certainly helps us to believe that a thing has been done, if we are shown that it can be done.|$|E

This activity generates not only millions of tons of mineral waste but also millions of tons of carbon dioxide gas emissions. Therefore, research about building materials based on renewable resources like <b>vegetable</b> <b>fibres</b> is needed. This paper discusses the use of <b>vegetable</b> <b>fibres</b> as reinforcement in cement based materials. It includes fibre characteristics, properties and the description of the treatments that improve their performance; it covers the compatibility between the fibres and the cement matrix and also how the fibres influence cement properties. It also includes the properties and durability performance of cementitious materials reinforced with <b>vegetable</b> <b>fibres.</b> Furthermore future research trends are also suggested...|$|R

Nearly eighty inches of yearly rain {{and more than}} eighty degrees of perpetual heat make swift work with <b>vegetable</b> <b>fibre,</b> which, in our cold and sluggard clime, would curdle into leaf-mould, perhaps into peat.

But this is the zone of illimitable sun-force, which destroys as swiftly as it generates, and generates again as swiftly as it destroys.

The sun-force must stay, shut up age after age, invisible, but strong; working at its own prison-cells; transmuting them, or making them capable of being transmuted by man, into the manifold products of coal--coke, petroleum, mineral pitch, gases, coal-tar, benzole, delicate aniline dyes, and what not, till its day of deliverance comes.|$|E

This vast morass was about thirty miles long, and ten miles wide, and its {{interior}} but little known. With his usual zeal and hardihood he explored it on horseback and on foot. In many parts it was covered with dark and gloomy woods of cedar, cypress, and hemlock, or deciduous trees, the branches of which were hung with long drooping moss. Other parts were almost inaccessible, from the density of brakes and thickets, entangled with vines, briers, and creeping plants, and intersected by creeks and standing pools. Occasionally the soil, composed of dead <b>vegetable</b> <b>fibre,</b> was over his horse's fetlocks, and sometimes he had to dismount and make his way on foot over a quaking bog that shook beneath his tread.|$|E

As to the scrapings of the window, nothing but <b>vegetable</b> <b>fibre</b> could there be detected; but on the stile, there was undoubtedly a mark containing human blood-disks; Tom proved that both by comparison with his books, and by pricking his own finger, and kept Ethel to see it after every one else was gone up to bed. But as one person's blood was like another's, who could tell whether some one with a cut finger had not been through the stile? Tom shook his head, there was not yet enough on which to commit himself. 'But I'll have him!--I'll have him yet!' said he. 'I'll never rest while that villain walks the earth unpunished!' ...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} inventive, {{sustainable}} strategies used in ground engineering is the substitution of biodegradable materials for non-biodegradable materials, particularly in situations where short-term ground improvement is needed. Biodegradable materials such as <b>vegetable</b> <b>fibres</b> have excellent engineering properties {{that could be used}} in the construction industry to enhance filtration, drainage and reinforcement. Two {{of the most}} important properties of <b>vegetable</b> <b>fibres</b> used for soil reinforcement are their high initial tensile strength and environmentally-friendly qualities. This paper investigates the time-dependent behaviour of basal-reinforced embankments erected on soft ground using biodegradable geotextiles, such as coir fibre, derived from coconuts, as reinforcing materials. An analytical model for soil reinforcement, which incorporates changes of foundation soil strength over time due to consolidation, is analyzed using the GEO 5 slope stability computer software. The initial strength of the fibre reinforcement required to achieve a specific factor of safety is calculated...|$|R

This paper presents an initial investigation on the use of a construction material, composed of cement and pre-treated (heat or alkaline treatments) sugar cane bagasse fibres. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyse the effect of fibre content and treatment on thermal conductivity, specific heat, flexural strength and density. The addition of retified fibres reduces composites thermal conductivity and yields a weaker specific heat in comparison with composites made with alkaline fibres. From mechanical point of view, composites made with alkaline fibres have a better flexural strength than others...|$|R
