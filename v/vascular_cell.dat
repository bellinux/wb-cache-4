25|$|A 2007 study {{reported}} {{the impact of}} the antibiotic minocycline on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes and serum immune molecules in 40 MS patients over 24 months of open-label minocycline treatment. Despite a moderately high pretreatment relapse rate in the patient group prior to treatment (1.3/year pre-enrollment; 1.2/year during a three-month baseline period), no relapses occurred between months 6 and 24 on minocycline. Also, despite significant MRI disease-activity pretreatment (19/40 scans had gadolinium-enhancing activity during a three-month run-in), the only patient with gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI at 12 and 24 months was on half-dose minocycline. Levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12), which at high levels might antagonize the proinflammatory IL-12 receptor, were elevated over 18 months of treatment, as were levels of soluble <b>vascular</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). The activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was decreased by treatment. Clinical and MRI outcomes in this study were supported by systemic immunological changes and call for further investigation of minocycline in MS.|$|E
2500|$|In vivo data {{supports}} {{a critical role}} for SFRP1 in ischemia-induced angiogenesis in adults. [...] Using adenovirus-expressing SFRP1, impaired the canonical Wnt/Fzd pathway in the early phase of ischemia {{and as a result}} reduced <b>vascular</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation and delayed vessel formation. [...] When SFRP1 was induced specifically in ECs along the kinetics of ischemia repair, a biphasic response was seen: [...] a delay in capillary formation until day 15 and then an increase in vascular formation at day 25. [...] This indicates that SFRP1 can fine tune the outcome of Wnt/Fzd signaling at different steps in the course of neovessel formation.|$|E

These genes contributed to biological processes including immune response, cytokine signaling, cellular adhesion and apoptotic process, indicating that they may be critical to protect <b>vascular</b> <b>cells</b> from inflammatory damage in a NF-κB-dependent manner (Fig.  9 D and S 1 G).

30|$|Here, using CRISPR/Cas 9 -mediated genome editing, we {{generated}} RelA-deficient {{human embryonic}} stem cells (ESCs) to abolish NF-κB activity. We obtained RelA-deficient VECs, VSMCs and MSCs via directed differentiation and uncovered a protective role of NF-κB/RelA in different human <b>vascular</b> <b>cells</b> under basal and inflammatory conditions. RelA deficiency in VECs resulted in impaired vasculogenesis and monocyte-endothelium adhesion, as well as excessive proliferation. In MSCs, loss of RelA resulted in defective proliferation and dysregulated differentiation potential. Additionally, RelA deficiency promoted TNFα-induced apoptosis in different human <b>vascular</b> <b>cells.</b> Further transcriptomic analysis of RelA-deficient <b>vascular</b> <b>cells</b> revealed the cellular changes in vascular matrix organization, angiogenesis, inflammatory response, cell proliferation and survival. Lastly, analysis of gene expression patterns in various IκBα knockout <b>vascular</b> <b>cells</b> showed that IκBα acted largely independent of RelA signaling under basal condition and upon TNFα stimulation. Taken together, our data illustrate a novel protective role of NF-κB/RelA in human <b>vascular</b> <b>cells</b> and provide a platform {{for the study of}} NF-κB function in human adult stem cells and somatic cells.|$|R

40|$|Bovine aortic endothelial and smooth-muscle cells {{down-regulate}} {{the rate}} of glucose transport {{in the face of}} hyperglycaemia, thus providing protection against deleterious effects of increased intracellular glucose levels. When exposed to high glucose concentrations these cells reduced the mRNA and protein content of their typical glucose transporter, GLUT- 1, as well as its plasma-membrane abundance. Inhibition of the lipoxygenase (LO) pathway, and particularly 12 -LO, reversed this glucose-induced down-regulatory process and restored {{the rate of}} hexose transport to the level seen in <b>vascular</b> <b>cells</b> exposed to normal glucose levels. This reversal was accompanied by increased levels of GLUT- 1 mRNA and protein, as well as of its plasma-membrane content. Exposure of the <b>vascular</b> <b>cells</b> to elevated glucose concentrations increased by 2 - 3 -fold the levels of cell-associated and secreted 12 -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12 -HETE), the product of 12 -LO. Inhibition of 15 - and 5 -LO, cyclo-oxygenases 1 and 2, and eicosanoid-producing cytochrome P 450 did not modify the hexose-transport system in <b>vascular</b> <b>cells.</b> These results suggest a role for HETEs in the autoregulation of hexose transport in <b>vascular</b> <b>cells.</b> 8 -Iso prostaglandin F(2 alpha), a non-enzymic oxidation product of arachidonic acid, had no effect on the hexose-transport system in <b>vascular</b> <b>cells</b> exposed to hyperglycaemic conditions. Taken together, these findings show that hyperglycaemia increases the production rate of 12 -HETE, which in turn mediates the down-regulation of GLUT- 1 expression and the glucose-transport system in vascular endothelial and smooth-muscle cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{classical}} estrogen receptor ERalpha mediates many of {{the known}} cardiovascular effects of estrogen and is expressed in male and female <b>vascular</b> <b>cells.</b> Estrogen-independent activation of ERalpha is known to occur in cells from reproductive tissues, but has not been investigated previously in <b>vascular</b> <b>cells.</b> In this study, transient transfection assays in human saphenous vein smooth muscle cells (HSVSMC) and pulmonary vein endothelial cells (PVEC) demonstrated ERalpha-dependent activation of estrogen response element-based, and vascular endothelial growth factor-based reporter plasmids by both estrogen-deficient FBS (ED-FBS) and EGF. In nonvascular cells, ERalpha-mediated gene expression can be activated via mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase- induced phosphorylation of serine 118 of ERalpha. However, in <b>vascular</b> <b>cells,</b> we found that pharmacologic inhibition of MAP kinase did not alter EGF-mediated ERalpha activation. In addition, a mutant ER containing an alanine-for-serine substitution at position 118 was activated {{to the same degree}} as the wild-type receptor by ED-FBS and EGF in both HSVSMC and PVEC. Furthermore, constitutively active MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) activated ERalpha in Cos 1 cells as expected, but MAPKK inhibited ER activation in PVEC. We conclude that growth factors also stimulate ERalpha-mediated gene expression in <b>vascular</b> <b>cells,</b> but find that this occurs via a MAP kinase-independent pathway distinct from that reported previously in nonvascular cells...|$|R

Methods and Results—We previously established a system for differentiating hES <b>cells</b> into <b>vascular</b> <b>cells.</b> We applied this system to human iPS cells and examined their directed differentiation. After differentiation, TRA 1 – 60 Flk 1 cells emerged and divided into VE-cadherin–positive and –negative populations.
