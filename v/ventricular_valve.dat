40|$|The {{objective}} was to measure the visual acuity (VA) of children with the diagnosis of hydrocephalus with or without peritoneal-ventricular shunt (PVS). A total of 55 children {{were included in the}} study (34 Female), with an age range of 0 to 291 weeks. The VA was measured by the sweep visual evoked potential technique. Of those with a PVS, in 31 the <b>ventricular</b> <b>valve</b> was inserted before 15 days after the diagnosis whereas in 14 the <b>ventricular</b> <b>valve</b> was inserted after 15 days. The sweep VEP was performed in all children, 95 exams (94 %) were abnormal and only 6 were normal. There was a statistical difference in the VA between children with a PVS inserted before 15 days of the diagnosis and children with a PVS after 15 days (p = 0. 038) or those without a shunt (p = 0. 031). Children with no complications of the PVS had a better VA as compared to those with shunt complications (p < 0. 001). In the group of children with complications, again those who had a shunt inserted be-fore 15 days had better VA results in com- parison to those in whom the shunt was inserted after 15 days (p = 0. 029). No statistical difference in the VA was found between children without the PVS and with those in which the shunt was inserted after 15 days of the di-agnosis of hydrocephalus (p = 0. 699). We conclude that the delayed insertion of the PVS may compromise the visual development of these children...|$|E
40|$|The elucidation of {{mechanisms}} in semilunar valve development might enable {{the development of}} new therapies for congenital heart disorders. Here, we found differences in proliferation-associated genes and genes repressed by VEGF between human semilunar valve leaflets from first and second trimester hearts. The proliferation of valve interstitial cells and <b>ventricular</b> <b>valve</b> endothelial cells (VECs) and cellular density declined from the first to the second trimester. Cytoplasmic expression of NFATC 1 was detected in VECs (4 weeks) and, later, cells in the leaflet/annulus junction mesenchyme expressing inactive NFATC 1 (5. 5 - 9 weeks) were detected, indicative of endocardial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EndMT) in valvulogenesis. At this leaflet/annulus junction, CD 44 (+) cells clustered during elongation (11 weeks), extending toward the tip along the fibrosal layer in second trimester leaflets. Differing patterns of maturation in the fibrosa and ventricularis were detected via increased fibrosal periostin content, which tracked the presence of the CD 44 (+) cells in the second trimester. We revealed that spatiotemporal NFATC 1 expression actively regulates EndMT during human valvulogenesis, as early as 4 weeks. Additionally, CD 44 (+) cells play a role in leaflet maturation toward the trilaminar structure, possibly via migration of VECs undergoing EndMT, which subsequently ascend from the leaflet/annulus junction...|$|E

40|$|Background/Objective: Primary cardiac {{neoplasms}} are rare, affect {{patients in}} all ages. The most common primary cardiac tumors is myxoma, {{which accounts for}} {{approximately half of the}} cases. Different MRI techniques can be used to evaluate cardiac morphol-ogy (including three-dimensional views), functional mass, <b>ventricular</b> <b>valve</b> motion, intracardiac and peri-cardiac masses, pericardial fluid. In this lecture the clinical, pathological, radiological features of the primary benign and malignant cardiac and pericardial tumors are going to be presented. "nPatients and Methods: The 46 patients were exam-ined with MRI (Siemens, Symphony, 1. 5 T, Germany) Standard views (2 chamber, 4 chamber, cinese-quences in short and long axis) uy and analysis were performed. All patients underwent MRI after 20 mi-nutes, following an intravenous bolus injection (0. 2 mmol/kg). Injection rate was 3 ml/sec, and was fol-lowed by 20 ml of saline. "nResult: One primary angiosarcoma, two myxomas, one primary lymphoma have been diagnosed. "nConclusion: The diagnosis and management of the primary cardiac tumors has been greatly facilitated by the development of noninvasive cardiac imaging. The preferred initial method for detecting cardiac tumours is echocardiography, but a complete assess-ment of the heart and surrounding tissues may some-times be difficult with this technique. Ehocardiography typically shows a solid mass of vari-able echogenicity, local spread to surrounding struc-tures, and physiologic consequences of the tumour mass. CT is helpful in the evaluation of the cardiac tumours as it demonstrates the broad -based tumour attachment, myocardial, pericardial, and mediastinal invasion, as well as extension into the great vessels and pulmonary metastases, when present. Optimal evaluation of the heart tumours is accom-plished with cardiac-gated MR imaging. The differen-tial diagnosis of the heart tumors must include benigh lesions such as a thrombus, haemangiomas, myxoma, lipoma and fibroma, and malignant tumors such as myxosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, neurofibrosarcoma, syn-ovial sarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, rhab-domyosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, un-differentiated sarcoma and lymphoma. MR imaging give very specific information in the evaluation of primary cardiac tumors- location, mor-phological features, and tissue characteristics, includ-ing the presence of calcification, fat fibrous tissue, hemorrhage, and cystic change, and may help to make the diagnosis...|$|E

40|$|The {{serotonin}} transporter (SERT) gene {{has been}} proposed as a candidate gene responsible for the {{sudden infant death syndrome}} (SIDS). In this study, {{for the first time we}} obtained a SERT-knockout (KO) mouse model which reproduces SIDS phenotype. SERT-KO mice were generated by mating SERT(Cre/+) heterozygous mice. The SERT-KO mouse embryos at the pre-natal stage E 18. 5 were lacking of SERT mRNA and protein expression in the heart. A premature death of 75 % of SERT-KO mice occurred in the first week after birth. LacZ staining of whole mounts and tissue sections of the heart from SERT(Cre/+);ROSA 26 R adult mice and E 18. 5 embryos demonstrated a marked localized expression of SERT in the right ventricle, the conal region, the vasculature, the atrial septum, the <b>ventricular</b> <b>valves,</b> and the sinoatrial node of the conduction system. These data suggest a cardiac phenotype for the sudden death of SERT-KO mice. Histological analysis of heart sections showed that SERT-KO mice develop cardiac fibrosis. Increased collagen accumulation in the myocardium and the valvular and perivascular regions, and enhanced expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin were detected in the heart of SERT-KO mice versus wild-type (WT) mice. Interestingly, higher expression levels of the 5 -HT 2 A receptor and increased levels of phospho-SMAD 2 / 3 and phospho-ERK 1 / 2 were detected in SERT-KO mouse heart versus WT mice.

MethodsWe reviewed all hand-sewn right <b>ventricular</b> outlet <b>valves</b> created by the author (Graham R. Nunn) {{in the setting of}} repaired tetralogy of Fallot or equivalent right ventricular outlet pathology when the native pulmonary valve could not be preserved. The valves were assessed by serial transthoracic echocardiography and more recently by magnetic resonance imaging angiography for late valve function. The bileaflet polytetrafluoroethylene valves were constructed in a standardized fashion from a semicircle of 0. 1 -mm polytetrafluoroethylene (the radius of which equaled the length of the outflow tract incision) that gave a lengthened free edge to the leaflets, central fixation of the free edge posteriorly just proximal to the branch pulmonary arteries, and generous augmentation of the outflow tract with polytetrafluoroethylene patch-plasty. The bileaflet configuration shortens the closing time against the posterior wall, and the leaflets are forced to maintain their configuration without prolapse into the right <b>ventricular</b> outlet. The <b>valve</b> can be generously oversized in young children to try to avoid the need for replacement. ResultsA total of 54 patients met the selection criteria— 22 patients received fresh autologous pericardial monocusps, 7 patients received polytetrafluoroethylene (0. 1 -mm) monocusps, and 25 patients received bileaflet polytetrafluoroethylene (0. 1 -mm) outlet valves. The pericardial valves have the longest follow-up, and all valves developed free pulmonary incompetence. Polytetrafluoroethylene monocusps had reliable competence early after surgery but progressed to pulmonary incompetence. The bileaflet polytetrafluoroethylene (0. 1 -mm) valves have remained competent with regurgitant fractions of only 5 % to 30 % (magnetic resonance imaging angiography), and this has remained stable with time. The maximum follow-up for these valves is 5 years. No stenosis or peripheral emboli have been recognized, and no valves have been replaced to date. ConclusionHand-sewn bileaflet polytetrafluoroethylene valves in the right ventricular outlet can reliably provide competence and maintain function in the medium term. Their shape and size allow placement in young children with a reasonable expectation that they will remain competent with growth of the native annulus and not require replacement. Their durability is superior to the pericardial and polytetrafluoroethylene monocusp valves in this series...|$|R

Although occlusion of the ventriculoperitoneal system can still take place in the <b>ventricular</b> catheter, <b>valve,</b> or locally at the distal end of the peritoneal tube or one of its connectors (Stark et al., 1974) and major intra-abdominal complications have been infrequent, a review of these widely reported problems is warranted for a surgeon faced with the management of such a situation. Wound infections or ven-triculitis associated with peritonitis have oc-curred and are successfully treated with anti-biotics and removal of the offending shunt.
