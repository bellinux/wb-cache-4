40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect on stock-price {{volatility}} of a significant event {{in the life of}} the firm, a change in its CEO. We find significant, long-lived increases in volatility following CEO turnover after controlling for firm characteristics and marketwide volatility. These increases are larger after forced departures and outside successions following <b>voluntary</b> <b>departures.</b> Stock prices also respond more strongly to earnings announcements following turnovers. These results are consistent with more informative signals of value driving the increased volatility, helping resolve two sources of uncertainty: possible changes in the firm's strategy and doubt about the successor CEO's ability. ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{now come}} to that period of Cicero's life in which, by common consent of all who have {{hitherto}} written of him, {{he is supposed to}} have shown himself as least worthy of his high name. Middleton, who certainly loved his hero's memory and was always anxious to do him justice, condemns him. [...] "It cannot be denied that in this calamity of his exile he did not behave himself with that firmness which might reasonably be expected from one who had borne so glorious a part in the Republic." [...] Morabin, the French biographer, speaks of the wailings of his grief, of its injustice and its follies. [...] "Cicéron était trop plein de son malheur pour donner entrée à de nouvelles espérances," [...] he says. [...] "Il avait supporté ce malheur avec peu de courage," [...] says another Frenchman, M. Du Rozoir, in introducing us to the speeches which Cicero made on his return. Dean Merivale declares that [...] "he marred the grace of the concession in the eyes of posterity"--alluding to the concession made to popular feeling by his <b>voluntary</b> <b>departure</b> from Rome, as will hereafter be described--"by the unmanly lamentations with which he accompanied it." [...] Mommsen, with a want of insight into character wonderful in an author who has so closely studied the history of the period, speaks of his exile as a punishment inflicted on a [...] "man notoriously timid, and belonging to the class of political weather-cocks." [...] "We now come," [...] says Mr. Forsyth, [...] "to the most melancholy period of Cicero's life, melancholy not so much from its nature and the extent of the misfortunes which overtook him, as from the abject prostration of mind into which he was thrown." [...] Mr. Froude, as might be expected, uses language stronger than that of others, and tells us that [...] "he retired to Macedonia to pour out his sorrows and his resentments in lamentations unworthy of a woman." [...] We have to admit that modern historians and biographers have been united in accusing Cicero of want of manliness during his exile. I propose--not, indeed, to wash the blackamoor white--but to show, if I can, that he was as white as others might be expected to have been in similar circumstances.|$|E

ABSTRACT: The globalization {{of the labor market}} has spawned new forms of mobility and expatriation such as individual expatriation. This communication is designed to expose the appropriate practices for better management of individual expatriates, in this case academics. A qualitative approach was undertaken with 10 "academics " expatriates in France from different nationalities. Their statements show that their host universities have no clear policies for the management of a foreign academic staff. The practices observed (injustice, discrimination, etc.) create counterproductive organizational behaviors and often lead to <b>voluntary</b> <b>departures...</b>|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that there are productivity differentials not only between younger and older workers, but also between newly hired, incumbent and exiting workers, two recent studies have focused on the productivity effects of age-specific flows of labor from and into the firm, i.e., the hiring and dismissal or <b>voluntary</b> <b>departures</b> of younger, prime-aged and older workers, respectively. Relating gross value added in several thousand Finnish firms over a time period of eight years to the in- and outflows of workers of different ages, Ilmakunnas and Maliranta (2007) showed that dismissals of older workers (age 49 +) with potentially outdated skills enhance productivity, whereas separations from prime-aged workers hamper a firm’s productivity, and that these effects are particularly high in innovative industries, such as ICT. Surprisingly, in none of the estimation models referring to the ICT industry hiring younger workers was found to enhance productivity.|$|R
30|$|Several recent {{empirical}} {{studies have demonstrated}} a range of effects of firm characteristics on employment careers. Grotheer et al. (2004) looked at the job stability of employees who had just joined a firm. They found a stabilizing effect of work councils on employment {{as well as a}} strong correlation between the prevalence of part-time or fixed-term employment and employees leaving the firm. A lack of opportunities for promotion owing to a firm’s age demographics was shown to have only a slightly positive effect on the probability of leaving a firm. According to Boockmann and Steffes (2005, 2010), a positive effect was evident from those firms that provided opportunities for further education. Work councils decreased job exit rates especially for blue-collar workers. Bergemann and Mertens (2004) found higher risks of dismissals in smaller firms along with lower rates of layoffs and <b>voluntary</b> <b>departures</b> in larger firms. Moreover, Giesecke and Heisig (2011) showed that men working in larger firms {{are much more likely to}} change employer.|$|R

50|$|Like {{withdrawal}} of {{application for admission}} and voluntary return, <b>voluntary</b> <b>departure</b> requires the alien to leave the United States, but does not put a removal order on the alien's record, thereby avoiding the bars to entry that a removal order would create. However, <b>voluntary</b> <b>departure</b> differs from the other processes in that its scope is not merely limited to arriving aliens. It can also apply to aliens who were admitted to the United States lawfully or entered unlawfully. Any days of unlawful presence acquired are not removed if the alien undergoes <b>voluntary</b> <b>departure.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{exploratory}} study of 57 large bankruptcies and 57 matched survivors examined the top management team (TMT) characteristics associated with major corporate failure. Prior research {{was used to}} guide selection of specific team characteristics for study. Not only did the failing firms show significant annual, or cross-sectional, divergence from survivors on several indicators of TMT composition, but also those divergences became more pronounced, even accelerating, {{over the last five}} years of the bankrupts' lives. The results thus suggest that deterioration of the top management team is a central element of the downward spiral of large corporate failures. Based upon a limited test of causality, the authors propose that a two-way process is at work: (1) team deficiencies bring about or aggravate corporate deterioration, either through strategic errors or stakeholder uneasiness with the flawed team; and (2) corporate deterioration brings about team deterioration, through a combination of <b>voluntary</b> <b>departures,</b> scapegoating, and limited resources for attracting new executive talent. top management teams, executive leadership, organizational decline, bankruptcy...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} turnover among chief executive officers (CEOs) and corporate sustainability performance (CSP) by identifying the influence of two major types of succession to the top job (internal or external promotion) {{and the reasons for}} change. Our model also integrates the firm’s past prioritization of CSP and the impact of a company’s participation in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Upper echelons theory and agency theory frameworks are adopted to understand CSP. Using an analysis of panel data for 88 public companies across 13 years in France, we find that a change of chief executive has a positive and significant effect on CSP 5 years after the change. This positive effect is stronger when the new CEO is recruited from outside the firm. The impact on CSP is invariably positive and significant, except for <b>voluntary</b> <b>departures.</b> The arrival of a new CEO affects CSP less when the firm has already achieved a high standard of CSP and participates in the GRI. These results are obtained after controlling CSP determinants already validated in the literature (financial performance, size, profitability, etc.). The findings show that expectations of CEOs are not solely economic and financial but also concern CSP. In terms of governance, they should prompt shareholders looking to strengthen CSP to choose new CEOs from outside the firm and to encourage the firm to participate in the GRI...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. For development of group-oriented distributed applications, a group membership protocol provides the mechanisms to dynamically adapt {{to changes in}} the membership, ensuring consistent views among all members of the group. This is achieved, by executing a distributed script, that implements a protocol, at each member to maintain a sequence of identical views, in spite of continuous changes, either voluntary or due to failure, to the membership. In asynchronous distributed environments, the protocol has to operate over a network that does not bound delivery times. This thesis presents a decentralized membership protocol, designed to operate on asynchronous environments, that organizes the members in a logical ring. The protocol assumes reliable FIFO channels, that fully interconnect all members to be available. These assumptions are later relaxed to adapt the protocol to real-world environments. Reconfigurations of the group are carried out using a two-phase algorithm. An agreement phase makes the change known to all operational members, and a commit phase integrates the change at all members, in the correct order. The protocol supports failures of one or more members, either successive or simultaneous, <b>voluntary</b> <b>departures,</b> and joining of new members. In the case of simultaneous events, the protocol ensures that they are incorporated one at a time, and following the same sequence, at all members. Lieutenant, Portuguese Nav...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1970 s, the House of Representatives {{appeared}} to be demonstrating signs of becoming less of an institution. This recent trend would be a reversal of a trend detected by Polsby in 1968. He found that the House was becoming more institutionalized. This deinstitutionalization {{has contributed to the}} problems which the House has faced in conducting its business, dealing with the Executive branch, and relating to the public. ^ The author hypothesized that a significant factor in initiating the deinstitutionalization was the reform passed in the early 1970 s. Utilizing historical accounts of the period, the details of the reforms are presented as well as their relation to the current ills of the House. ^ In order to demonstrate the trend of deinstitutionalization, the author employed many of the same indicators of institutionalization as Polsby. This required the collection of aggregate data on various aspects of Congress from 1953 to 1981. Also, a survey of retired Congressmen (retired from the 94 th, 95 th, and 96 th Congresses) was conducted to acquire information on the reasons for the rise of <b>voluntary</b> <b>departures</b> from the House. ^ The study concluded that the trend in deinstitutionalization is genuine, and that it will continue into the foreseeable future. More importantly, the House can anticipate further problems in internal operations as a consequence of this trend. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} {{analysed}} {{the share price}} reactions to changes in top management. A distinction was made among different types of CEO turnover: forced resignation, <b>voluntary</b> <b>departures</b> and age-related retirements. The announcement of a forced CEO resignation is hailed favourably by the market with a small but significantly positive abnormal return of 0. 5 %. The market may have anticipated the forced turnover since the abnormal return over a one-month period prior to the turnover amounts to 6 %. Wher as voluntary resignations do not cause a price reactions, age-related turnover triggers a small negative price reaction. Subsequently, a more detailed classification of the change of top management was made based on {{the background of the}} successor (an internal versus external candidate), {{on the size of the}} corporation and the degree of corporate diversification. Expectedly, the nomination of an external manager following the performance-related forced resignation of a CEO causes a strong increase in abnormal returns of more than 2 %. The cumulative abnormal return of an internal CEO promotion in a poorly performing firms drops by almost 1 % on the day of the announcement. Presumably, this is because the internal manager is held (partially) responsible for past poor performance. In companies with good past performance and with internal succession, there is a price decline, but this is not statistically significant. The paper also analysed which corporate governance mechanisms are responsible for forced CEO turnover. A logit regression which accounted for time and industry specific fixed effects did not reveal a relation between performance and turnover. Furthermore, institutional investors, banks and the government do not seem to provoke CEO departures even if they own large blocks of equity. We did not find evidence that the government exerts control in the companies in which it holds majority shareholdings. In contrast, when industrial companies are major owners, there is evidence that forced turnover is facilitated. It also seems that it is easier to remove management in smaller companies than in larger ones. On the part of holding companies, there is only some evidence that they take a monitoring role in the case of other listed holding companies. No correlation was discovered between the degree of leverage and forced CEOs departures, although CEO turnover is acilitated if creditors have their own representatives on the board. Likewise, a high proportion of shareholder representatives on the board leads to a higher probability of forced CEO resignations. However, this probability decreases when the founding family is represented by one or more (executive) directors. ...|$|R
40|$|Farming {{households}} that {{differ in their}} ability, or willingness to take on risks are likely to make different decisions when allocating resources, and effort among income-producing activities, with consequences for productivity. The authors measure <b>voluntary,</b> and involuntary <b>departures</b> from efficiency for rice-producing households in Bicol, Philippines. They {{take advantage of a}} panel of household observations from 1978, 1983, and 1994. The unusually long-time span of the panel provides ample opportunities for the surveyed households to learn, and apply successful available technologies. The authors find evidence that diversification, and technology choices do effect outcomes among farmers, although these effects are not dominant. Accumulated wealth, past decisions to invest in education, favorable market conditions, and propitious weather are also important determinants of efficiency outcomes among Bicol rice farmers.
