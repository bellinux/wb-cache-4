5|$|During a rainy {{holiday in}} Hastings {{at the end}} of November 1903, Potter {{outlined}} a tale about a cat, a dog, and a tea party she called Something very <b>very</b> <b>NICE.</b> She discussed the Lakefield sketches as backgrounds for the tale with Warne. He proposed a large format volume similar to L. Leslie Brooke's Johnny Crow's Garden to do justice to the detail of the illustrations, but the entire project was set aside when The Tale of Benjamin Bunny and The Tale of Two Bad Mice were chosen for development and publication in 1904.|$|E
5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's {{based on a}} guy I never {{actually}} met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had already retired by the time I started but I used to get a lift to work from his wife, who still worked there. And she would tell me stories about him with the affectionate disdain of {{anyone who has been}} married for more than a year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if he got the chance. I've since found out that the real man is actually a <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> bloke.|$|E
25|$|Scanning {{electron}} microscopy (SEM) visualizes {{details on the}} surfaces of specimens and gives a <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> 3D view. It gives results much {{like those of the}} stereo light microscope. The best resolution for SEM in 2011 was 0.4 nanometer.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, it's {{been opened}} up several years. And {{they say it}} isn't like the hotel life {{anywhere}} else; it's charming. And there's the <b>very</b> <b>nicest</b> class of people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's a {{dear old}} goose, then, if that will please you better--the <b>very</b> <b>nicest</b> old goose that I {{ever had to}} do with. Did he mention Bladud to you?" ...|$|R
25|$|It {{would later}} be {{revealed}} {{that he was the}} younger (and less worthy; the black sheep) brother of the true count, who was a <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> guy. The real Count had mysteriously disappeared, an act supposedly engineered (but could not be proven) by his nastier brother, so that he could become the count. With his brother's disappearance, he claimed everything.|$|E
25|$|Any {{reference}} {{in the script}} to the devastation caused by the Allied bombings was removed. In the script, Shukichi remarks to Onodera’s wife in Kyoto that her city is a <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> place, unlike Tokyo, with all its ruins. The censors deleted the reference to ruins (as an implied critique of the Allies) and, in the finished film, the word “hokorippoi” (“dusty”) was substituted as a description of Tokyo.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} the result, leading Scottish Conservative {{supporter}} Paul McBride QC resigned from the party, citing that he 'frequently found himself {{at odds with the}} party in recent months', particularly with their policy on anti-sectarianism legislation and said of new party leader Ruth Davidson, that 'they have a leader who has no policies and little experience apart from having been on television about as many times as I have' and that (the Scottish Conservatives) 'replaced one nice woman with one not so <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> woman'.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I don't, Aunt Hannah! I'd give {{anything}} in this world if I could stay, {{for this is the}} <b>very</b> <b>nicest</b> place I ever was in. Oh, indeed, I don't want to go away!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The <b>very</b> <b>nicest</b> {{place in}} all the world {{excepting}} the Green Meadows and the Smiling Pool!" [...] replied Jerry promptly. [...] "Won't you stay, Cousin Paddy? I'm sure we would all like to have you." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was a {{trace of}} pride in Muriel's smile. [...] "Of course; but, after all, {{there are not many}} men who can do almost anything, like--Harry Jefferson. Some of the <b>very</b> <b>nicest</b> ones seem quite unable to make money." ...|$|R
25|$|Almost all {{actively}} visited {{areas in}} the path of totality had perfect weather. Many observers reported an unusually beautiful eclipse, with many or all effects visible, and a <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> corona, despite the proximity to the solar minimum. The partial phase of the eclipse was also visible from the International Space Station, where the astronauts on board took spectacular pictures of the moon's shadow on Earth's surface. It initially appeared as though an orbit correction set for the middle of March would bring the ISS into the path of totality, but this correction was postponed.|$|E
25|$|He made {{no attempt}} to direct this picture. He just sat in his {{director}}'s chair like a dead man. He had been <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> and sweetly dead ever since the scandal that ruined his career. But it was such an amazing thing for me to come in to make this broken-down picture, and to find my director was the great Roscoe Arbuckle. Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.|$|E
25|$|Cast threads {{in metal}} parts may be {{finished}} by machining, {{or may be}} left in the as-cast state. (The same can be said of cast gear teeth.) Whether or not to bother with the additional expense of a machining operation depends on the application. For parts where the extra precision and surface finish is not strictly necessary, the machining is forgone in order to achieve a lower cost. With sand casting parts this means a rather rough finish; but with molded plastic or die-cast metal, the threads can be <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> indeed straight from the mold or die. A common example of molded plastic threads is on soda (pop) bottles. A common example of die-cast threads is on cable glands (connectors/fittings).|$|E
6000|$|... "Everybody {{you meet}} will love you {{as long as}} you live." [...] said the Story Girl. [...] "There that's the <b>very</b> <b>nicest</b> fortune I can tell you, and it will come true whether the others do or not, and now we must go in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite the <b>very</b> <b>nicest.</b> Consider {{that fact}} well {{and even if}} you only said it by {{accident}} don't be funny--as you know you sometimes CAN be--and take it back. It's all right. It's charming, isn't it? when our troubles bring us more together. Now go up to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't {{hair from}} the coat of a horse that we want," [...] cried Chippy, as he {{prepared}} to fly after Mrs. Chippy. [...] "It is long hair form the tail or mane of a horse that we must have. It makes the <b>very</b> <b>nicest</b> kind of lining for a nest." ...|$|R
25|$|Perin Thomas: A {{student at}} AEHS. At first, Mia can't {{figure out whether}} Perin is {{a boy or a}} girl. She {{turns out to be a}} girl and becomes friends with Mia. She is again mistaken for a boy in Grandmère's musical, in which she is given a male role. Perin is a <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> person, as she asked if Mia was alright after Michael announces he is moving to Japan, and, though shocked by Mia's new haircut in book eight, says nothing about it. She is also {{surprisingly}} strong and well-mannered. In book ten, it is continually implied that Perin and Ling Su are romantically involved with each other, though this is not confirmed but in the eleventh book Perin and Ling Su become a couple and together run The Frank Gianini Community center.|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{question}} has again been revived {{after many years}} of slumber, and business men in Quebec seem hopeful that something will come of it, though the placing of a subsidy on the statute book is but {{a small part of the}} work to be accomplished, as some of its enthusiastic promoters will, ere long, discover. Both Federal and Provincial Governments seem disposed to contribute towards the cost, and the City of Quebec will also be expected to do its share. Many of our people have objected to any contribution being given by the city unless the bridge is built opposite the town, and the CHRONICLE like every other good citizen of Quebec would prefer to see it constructed at Diamond Harbor, and has contended in the interests of the city for this site as long as there seemed to be any possibility of securing it there. It would still do so if it appeared that our people could have it at that site. A bridge at Diamond Harbor would, it estimated, cost at least eight millions. It would be <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> to have, with its double track, electric car track, and roads for vehicles and pedestrians, and would no doubt create a goodly traffic between the two towns, and be one of the show works of the continent.|$|E
25|$|Indiana {{would start}} {{the game with}} the ball and move into Badgers territory. Indiana QB Nate Sudfeld then threw a deep pass that was intercepted by CB Sojourn Shelton at the Wisconsin 7-yard line. On the first play from {{scrimmage}} for the Badgers, RB James White ran 93 yards for the touchdown. On Indiana's second possession, a fumbled snap was recovered by OLB Brendan Kelly at the Indiana 14-yard line. The Badgers would score three plays later on a Melvin Gordon 1-yard touchdown run. Indiana was forced to punt and Wisconsin would settle for a 31-yard field goal by K Jack Russell. Another punt for the Hoosiers and the Badgers would again {{have to settle for}} a field goal, this time it was a 36-yard field goal by Jack Russell. Indiana would have the ball near midfield as the first quarter came to a close with Wisconsin leading 20–0. Indiana's drive stalled at about midfield and gave the ball back to Wisconsin. The Badgers would then be forced to punt for the first time of the game. After an Indiana three–and–out, Wisconsin took over at their own 7-yard line. The Badgers put together a <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> 9 plays 93 yard scoring drive that was capped with a 32-yard touchdown run by WR Jared Abbrederis. The Hoosier and Badgers would exchange punts as Indiana then closed out the half by running out the clock. The Badgers led 27–0 at halftime.|$|E
60|$|Master George was Mr. and Mrs. Shelby's son. He {{was very}} fond of Tom, and was {{teaching}} him to write. He often used to come and have tea in Uncle Tom's little cottage. Aunt Chloe used to make her <b>very</b> <b>nicest</b> cakes when Mas'r George came to tea. But he was not at home now, {{and did not know}} that Tom had been sold.|$|R

25|$|The Witch {{has raised}} Rapunzel {{as her own}} daughter, keeping her locked away from {{the world in a}} tall tower {{in the middle of the}} woods, {{accessible}} only by climbing Rapunzel's long, golden hair ("Our Little World"). However, on this day a handsome prince spies the beautiful Rapunzel and resolves to climb the tower himself. In another part of the wood, the Baker has tracked down Little Red Ridinghood. Following the Witch's advice, he attempts to simply steal the red cape, but her ensuing temper tantrum guilts him into returning it. When Little Red Ridinghood arrives at her grandmother's house, she is swallowed by the Wolf. The Baker, in pursuit of the cape, slays the Wolf, pulling Little Red Ridinghood and her grandmother from the beast's innards. Little Red Riding hood rewards him with the red cape, reflecting on her new experiences ("I Know Things Now"). Meanwhile, Jack's mother angrily tosses the beans aside, which end up growing into an enormous stalk overnight, and sends her son to bed without supper. As Cinderella flees the Festival, pursued by another handsome prince and his steward, the Wife helps her hide and quizzes Cinderella about the ball. Cinderella explains that it was a nice ball ("A <b>Very</b> <b>Nice</b> Prince") but seems fairly ambivalent about the experience. As a giant beanstalk begins to sprout from the ground next to Jack's cottage, the Baker's Wife spots Cinderella's pure gold slippers. She tries to chase after Cinderella but inadvertently allows Milky White to run off, leaving the Baker's Wife without the slippers or the cow. The characters each state morals and credos as the first midnight chimes ("First Midnight") and they continue their journeys through the woods.|$|E
500|$|In 1909, John's great-aunt, the Dowager Empress of Russia {{wrote to}} her son, Emperor Nicholas II, that [...] "George's {{children}} are <b>very</b> <b>nice...</b> The little ones, George and Johnny are both charming and very amusing..." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't {{you know}} him?" [...] asked a sharp voice {{so close to}} Peter that it made him jump. Peter whirled around. There sat Striped Chipmunk {{grinning}} {{at him from the}} top of the old stone wall. [...] "That's Weaver the Orchard Oriole," [...] Striped Chipmunk rattled on. [...] "If you don't know him you ought to, because he is one of the <b>very</b> <b>nicest</b> persons in the Old Orchard. I just love to hear him sing." ...|$|R
60|$|I'm {{glad to be}} able to say, too, {{that even}} in the heyday of their delight and {{surprise}} over their wonderful presents, the little Josephs did not forget to appreciate the gifts they had prepared for each other. Mollie thought her calendar just too pretty for anything, and Jimmy was sure the new red mittens which Maggie had knitted for him with her own chubby wee fingers, were the <b>very</b> <b>nicest,</b> gayest mittens a boy had ever worn.|$|R
500|$|Algis Budrys {{concluded}} {{his review}} of The Watch Below with [...] "...this is <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> writing when considered simply as prose and {{as an attempt to}} involve the reader's emotions."

500|$|He {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{characters}} outside the immediate Simpson family to appear on the show, and has since been central to several episodes, the first being season two's [...] "Dead Putting Society". His last name comes from Flanders St. in Portland, Oregon, the hometown of Simpsons creator Matt Groening. When he was created, he was intended to just be a neighbor who was <b>very</b> <b>nice,</b> but whom Homer loathed.|$|E
500|$|Peterson {{served as}} the best man at a wedding planned by the [...] "Morning Zoo" [...] of radio station KKRZ (Z-100) FM in 1989. Professional wrestler Rowdy Roddy Piper officiated. Peterson, who had never met the 24-year-old groom, called him [...] "a <b>very</b> <b>nice</b> young gentleman." [...] He also played bongo drums on Where's the Art?, a public-access {{television}} cable TV show with Stephanie Pierce, proprietor of the 24 Hour Church of Elvis.|$|E
60|$|When Unc' Billy Possum {{suddenly}} {{changed the}} subject by asking Jimmy Skunk if he had found any nice fresh eggs lately, he touched a subject very close to Jimmy's heart. I should have said, rather, his stomach. To tell the truth, it was a longing for some eggs that had brought Jimmy to the Green Forest. He knew that somewhere there Mrs. Grouse must be hiding a nestful of the <b>very</b> <b>nicest</b> of eggs, and it was to hunt for these that he had come.|$|R
