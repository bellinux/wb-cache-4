40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of water vending in Onitsha, Nigeria, {{one of the most important}} market towns in West Africa. It illustrates that a rapid reconnaissance survey of water vending activities and the willingness of households to pay for improved water services can yield valuable information for water supply planning and unexpected policy insights. The vast majority of Onitsha obtains its water from an elaborate and well-organized water <b>vending</b> <b>system</b> which has been created and is operated by the private sector. Approximately 275 tanker trucks purchase water from about 20 private boreholes and then sell it to households and businesses equipped with water storage facilities. Many of the households which purchase water from tanker trucks resell the water by the bucket to individuals who cannot afford large storage tanks or who cannot be reached by tanker trucks. During the dry season households obtain approximately 2. 96 million gallons per day (mgd) from the water <b>vending</b> <b>system,</b> for which they pay about US$ 28, 000. In 1987 the public water utility was supplying about 1. 5 mgd during the dry season and only managed to collect US$ 1, 100 in revenues. In the rainy season the revenues from water vendor sales were still several times higher than the water utility. On an annual basis, households in Onitsha are already paying water vendors over twice the operation and maintenance costs of a piped distribution system.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a {{heuristic}} for the inventory management of smart <b>vending</b> machine <b>systems</b> with product substitution under the replenishment point, order-up-to level policy and to evaluate its performance. Design/methodology/approach: The heuristic is developed on the basis of the decoupled approach. An integer linear mathematical model is built to determine the number of product storage compartments and replenishment threshold for each smart vending machine in the system and the Clarke and Wright’s savings algorithm is applied to route vehicles for inventory replenishments of smart vending machines that share the same delivery days. Computational experiments are conducted on several small-size test problems to compare the proposed heuristic with the integrated optimization mathematical model with respect to system profit. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is carried out on a medium-size test problem to evaluate the effect of the customer service level on system profit using a computer simulation. Findings: The results show that the proposed heuristic yielded pretty good solutions with 5. 7 % error rate on average compared to the optimal solutions. The proposed heuristic took about 3 CPU minutes on average in the test problems being consisted of 10 five-product smart vending machines. It was confirmed that the system profit is significantly affected by the customer service level. Originality/value: The inventory management of smart <b>vending</b> machine <b>systems</b> is newly treated. Product substitutions are explicitly considered in the model. The proposed heuristic is effective as well as efficient. It can be easily modified for application to various retail vending settings under a vendor-managed inventory scheme with POS syste...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that raw milk can contain {{microorganisms}} that are harmful to health. In light of {{the increasing number of}} machines where raw milk is sold via raw milk <b>vending</b> <b>systems,</b> the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has assessed the risk for food infections with the Campylobacter bacterium resulting from the milk dispensed from these raw milk vending machines. The assessment also addresses {{the question of whether the}} more frequent occurrence of outbreaks of illness due to Campylobacter infections (Campylobacter enteritis or Campylobacteriosis) could be associated with the increase in the number of points of sale for raw milk and in particular raw milk vending machines. As there are no validated empirical data, the preliminary assessment of the BfR is based on the working hypothesis that changes in consumer behaviour entailing the increased consumption of raw milk from the so-called "milk vending machines" is leading to more frequent outbreaks of Campylobacter. One of the main sources of contamination of the raw milk is faecal contamination during the milking process. Unlike most known foodborne pathogens, these bacteria cannot multiply in the raw milk. However, just a few Campylobacter cells are enough to cause infection. The BfR therefore advises consumers to always comply with the instruction displayed at the point of sale stating "raw milk – boil before consumption". The BfR also advises against preparing and consuming non-heated ("cold") cocoa drinks or other milkshakes made from raw milk both directly on-site and at home (also see the BfR FAQ on the consumption of raw milk [URL]). The full version of this BfR Information is available in German on [URL]...|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} {{continuity}} water vending {{will continue to}} grow {{as long as there is}} lack of supply or intermittent supply (irregular, inefficient and inadequate) from KNSWB (Parkman 2000) which is obvious at present, coupled with the rapid population increase in Kano, about 3.36 % growth rate (National Population Commission—NPC 2010). These are indications that the market potential for this system is assured. Another point is that the individual/household-based nature of water <b>vending</b> <b>system</b> presents a simple process without unnecessary institutional difficulties. The entire relationship is based on pure economic relationship of demand and supply and once households are supplied, the system is assured of its continuity. The consumers, nevertheless, have problems with the waiting time of more than 2  h which they consider very long and in some places have to travel a distance of more than 500  m before getting the water vendor.|$|E
40|$|Effective {{self-service}} automation requires {{data sharing}} among non-proprietary system components. Historically, the original self-service provider, the vending industry, {{has failed to}} develop and implement open architecture standards that enable seamless data sharing among disparate devices and servers in a network. This lack of interoperability among the main entities in a sophisticated <b>vending</b> <b>system</b> (e. g. vending machine controller, telemetry device, vending management software, and cashless payment equipment) has contributed to a lack of innovation and creativity in the evolution of unattended point-ofsale retailing. Recently crafted Vending Data Interchange (VDI) standards from the National Automatic Merchandising Association (NAMA) provide a non-proprietary means by which to share machine-level data among diverse technology providers. The VDI standards are designed to ensure reliability, continuity, and longevity among installed hardware, software, and netware. In essence, VDI standards contain technical specifications that bundle vending machine-level data for easy distribution throughout a vending operator’s technology network and can be implemented by a qualified provider without operator involvement...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine the participation of women in street vending and then evaluate its sustainability as a livelihood strategy by women in Harare Central Business District. Livelihood indicators were used in evaluating sustainability and these include, food security, income levels, level and quality of education, ability to acquire assets and the health standards. A sample of 30 women from 5 selected vending sites were selected as respondents. The researcher used structured questioners and interviews in conducting the research. The findings were based on the information captured in the questioners and the interviews which were conducted {{face to face with the}} women. Women dominated the number of those in street vending in Harare CBD although man and youths were also in the streets. The participation of women in street vending managed to help women improve the poverty levels in their families. The income in families improved as compare to the period before street vending, but however the incomes were very small and differed with the goods at sell. In education women could now send their children to school but to acquire basic education and also using local schools that had lower fees. Food security in household improved and women and their families could now afford to eat at least 2 meals per day. Healthy facilities became accessible, although it was basic and only local clinics. The participation of women in street vending has helped in improving the poverty levels of women but however cannot be sustainable as a livelihood strategy because of the challenges that cripple the <b>vending</b> <b>system</b> and that include, harassment from town officials, cheap and poor quality of good on sell, lack of proper infrastructure, lack of operating licenses discs and low demand and high competition...|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} provides {{a case study}} of water vending in Enugu North Local Government Area, Enugu State of South Eastern Nigeria. Questionnaire copies were randomly distributed in the study area to 200 households. Data obtained from the field were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square test. The analysis revealed that almost all the residents of Enugu North L. G. A. obtain their water from independent water <b>vending</b> <b>systems</b> which are operated by the private sector. Tanker truck, distributing and small retail water vendors all operate in the study area. There are an estimated number of 250 tanker truck drivers serving Enugu North L. G. A. Approximately 35 tanker trucks serve Hill- top/Udi siding ward, while there are a total of 52 retail vendors in Onuasata ward. Majority of the respondents are low income earners who spend within the ranges of NGN 500 ($ 3. 33) and NGN 1500 ($ 10) a month on water on the average. 50. 0 percent of these respondents opined that vended water was expensive. Of the respondents, 49. 4 percent consumed 91 - 100 litres per capita per day, which is less than the 120 litres per capita per day recommended by the Federal Re- public of Nigeria’s National water supply and sanitation policy document of 2000. This deficit {{can be attributed to the}} cost of vended water. From the chi-square test, there is significant difference in the unit cost of water sold by vendors in the various wards in Enugu North L. G. A. In the absence of regular water provision through pipe-connections from the public utility, water vending should be supported but regulated. Meeting the water and sanitation target and optimizing water resources for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 will require a dramatic scaling up of joint efforts by the state government and the people in ensuring that vendors provide safe water at a low cost...|$|R

By applying advanced technologies in different historical periods, retailers and marketers could provide consumers with an effective purchase process and secure online transaction. This research adopted a historical analysis approach to review the influences of various technologies in different periods of time. A 5 -level scale analysis had been applied to study the integration of technologies in retailing; they are (1) Entry; (2) Adoption; (3) Refinement; (4) Infusion; and (5) Transformation. Five key periods have been identified based on this analysis. This research is not going to build theories, but rather critically looking at how the emergence of advanced technologies in different stages of the chronological order that shaped our consumers. The analysis shows that the concept of shopping is no longer around retailing strategies in physical store but rather a bigger scope of virtual worlds. Technologies had been playing a crucial role in shaping our consumers experiences.
