5|$|Hundreds of {{emergency}} personnel {{responded to the}} crash site and helped save victims. Many of those who survived were severely injured and required months or years to physically recover. NTSB investigators looked at various factors {{that contributed to the}} crash. The failures of the flight crew were cited as the probable cause of the crash, but the weather, air traffic controller performances, and FAA traffic management were also cited as contributing to the events that led to the accident. This conclusion was controversial, with disagreement between investigators, passengers, and Avianca as to who was ultimately responsible. Eventually, the U.S. government joined with Avianca and settled to pay for the damages to the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families. The crash was also portrayed in a variety of media.|$|E
5|$|In {{cultures}} {{that did not}} recognize a smallpox deity, there was often nonetheless a belief in smallpox demons, who were accordingly blamed for the disease. Such beliefs were prominent in Japan, Europe, Africa, {{and other parts of}} the world. Nearly all cultures who believed in the demon also believed that it was afraid of the color red. This led to the invention of so-called red treatment, where <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> rooms would be decorated in red. The practice spread to Europe in the 12th century and was practiced by (among others) Charles V of France and Elizabeth I of England. Afforded scientific credibility through the studies by Finsen showing that red light reduced scarring, this belief persisted even until the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} came at {{a delicate}} time for relations between Iran and Western nations, which were removing sanctions on Iran after its compliance with an agreement for curtailing development of its nuclear enrichment program. The agreement stipulated that once Iranian compliance with {{the terms of the}} agreement was verified, most sanctions against Iran would be lifted, including all sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council as well as nuclear-related European Union and U.S. sanctions; U.S. sanctions against Iran for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles would not be affected. In mid-January 2016, most sanctions were lifted. In March, the District Court for the Southern District of New York found, by default, that Iran had provided support to certain terrorist groups and individuals responsible for the September 11 attacks and awarded $10.5billion in damages to the plaintiffs, which consisted of $3billion to reimburse insurance companies for paid claims and $7.5billion for <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families ($2million for pain and suffering and $6.88million in punitive damages per victim). The same judge ruled just six months earlier that there was insufficient evidence linking Saudi Arabia—which has sour relations with Iran—to the 9/11 attacks to overcome, under the terrorism exemption, Saudi Arabia's immunity under the FSIA.|$|E

25|$|There {{was also}} a $5 billion lawsuit filed by the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> {{families}} against the owner, landlord, city, and some building material manufacturers. That suit was settled during July 1995 for $15.8 million or $163,000 per victim. The lesser amount was due mostly to unrelated financial difficulties of the landlord.|$|E

50|$|A serial rapist can use online dating {{sites to}} {{identify}} potential victims. Threatening {{harm to the}} <b>victim</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> family is another tactic used. Drugging the victim is sometimes employed. Some serial rapists are specific in identifying <b>their</b> targets <b>and</b> <b>their</b> schedules. A serial rapist may describe their activities on websites, describing the tactics they use to commit the sexual assault. One recent 18-year-old accused of serial rapes used messaging cell phone apps, Facebook, Kik, and Snapchat to establish a relationship with girls. Some serial rapists drive victims to remote locations.|$|R
50|$|Die Healing is {{the seventh}} album by doom metal pioneers Saint Vitus, which was {{released}} in 1995 by Hellhound Records. It was their final album before their breakup in 1996.

25|$|Carolyn McCarthy—whose husband Dennis McCarthy {{was killed}} by Ferguson, and whose son Kevin McCarthy was {{severely}} injured—was subsequently elected to the United States Congress, {{on a platform of}} gun control.

Some of Ferguson's other <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> family members have also become involved in gun control efforts.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the physical and psychological damages resulting from rape, sexual violence {{in the context of}} war often disrupt the linkages between the rape <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> communities. Thus, the phenomenon of war rape can structurally affect entire societies, which is closely linked to the logic underlying the strategic use of rape as an instrument in armed conflicts. Raping ‘enemy’ women also constitutes an act of abuse and humiliation against the men of the community the victims were representative of.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the victim}} {{has joined the}} offender, various {{techniques}} are used to restrict the victim's access to communication with home, such as imposing physical punishment unless the victim complies with the trafficker's demands and making threats of harm and even death to the <b>victim</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> family. Sometimes, the victims will succumb to the Stockholm Syndrome because their captors will pretend to [...] "love" [...] and [...] "need" [...] them, even {{going so far as}} promise marriage and future stability. This is particularly effective with younger victims, because they are more inexperienced and therefore easily manipulated.|$|R
25|$|Organizers of the 2013 Vancouver Sun Run, {{which was}} held on April 21, 2013, donated $10 from every late entry for the race to help victims of the bombing at the Boston Marathon. Jamie Pitblado, {{vice-president}} of promotions for The Vancouver Sun and The Province, said the money would go to One Fund Boston, an official charity that collected donations for the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families. Sun Run organizers raised anywhere from $25,000 to $40,000. There were over 48,000 participants, many dressed in blue and yellow (Boston colors) with others wearing Boston Red Sox caps.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} focus climaxed on April 23, when President Bill Clinton, {{along with}} Governor Keating and the Reverend Billy Graham, spoke in Oklahoma City. In the weeks following the bombing, rescue efforts ceased {{and the building}} was imploded. Through both his own works and the works of his wife Cathy Keating, Governor Keating gained both national and international attention for his efforts to help the <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families. Governor Keating also created a $6 million fund to assist victims and provide for college scholarships for children who lost a parent, or both parents, in the attack.|$|E
25|$|The {{conclusion}} contained many factual errors: eating {{fish and}} shellfish from {{other areas of the}} Shiranui Sea, not just Minamata Bay, could cause the disease; eating small amounts, as well as large amounts of contaminated fish over a long time also produced symptoms; the outbreak had not, in fact, ended in 1960 nor had mercury-removing wastewater facilities been installed in January 1960. Nevertheless, the government announcement brought a feeling of relief to a great many <b>victims</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families. Many felt vindicated in their long struggle to force Chisso to accept responsibility for causing the disease and expressed thanks that their plight had been recognised by their social superiors. The struggle now focused on to what extent the victims should be compensated.|$|E
