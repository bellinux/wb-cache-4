40|$|Infectious {{bronchitis}} (IB) is {{an acute}} highly contagious viral respiratory disease of poultry caused by virus {{belongs to the}} family of Coronaviridae. The virus consist of many serotypes with low level of cross-protectivity among serotypes. Field data showed that the outbreaks of IB were frequently reported in chicken flocks, although vaccinations against the disease have been practiced. Hence, the study on serotype relationship among isolates of the viruses is essentially required. The aim {{of this study was to}} isolate and characterize IB viruses from chicken flocks in some areas of Java. Isolation of the virus was carried out in nine-day old embrionated chicken eggs and identified by means of agar gel precipitation (AGP) tests against standard antisera to IB virus. The serotypes of the IB <b>viral</b> <b>isolates</b> were determined by cross-neutralization tests in nine day old embryonated chicken eggs using r value derived from homologous and heterologous serum titres as criteria. This study obtained 12 IB <b>viral</b> <b>isolates</b> which were identified on the basis of the ability to cause lesions in chicken embryos and positive to agar gel presipitation test against standard positive antiserum to the virus.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Avian {{infectious}} bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates {{have been widely}} characterized by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. In present study, these techniques were applied to three viral genomic regions comprising the complete and/or a partial S 1 segment, S 2 and nucleocapsid genes. DNA sequences from <b>viral</b> <b>isolates</b> obtained from 1972 to 1989 and from 2006 to 2008 were compared. High similarity (> 90 %) was observed {{among some of the}} genomic segments, including S 1 hypervariable region, which could suggest a common origin or ancestry. DNA sequences from S 2 and N protein genes obtained from different infected tissues of the same flock were analyzed, and a clear segregation between respiratory and intestinal tract was observed. Therefore, these data suggest cocirculation of more than one viral strain in the same flock. 57. 1 % of DNA sequences from the S 1 complete segment samples, 53. 3 % from the S 2 fragment and 62. 5 % from the partial N gene were found to be different from analyzed sequences from reference strains leading to the conclusion that parte of <b>viral</b> <b>isolates</b> included in this study may be considered region specific.

In this study sequential <b>viral</b> <b>isolates</b> were analyzed from five patients with prior zidovudine (AZT) use who received 6 to 16 months of ddI therapy. Following ddI therapy, <b>viral</b> <b>isolates</b> exhibited an increased AZT susceptibility and decreased ddI susceptibility. Sequence and nested PCR analysis of the HIV- 1 RT gene revealed that two <b>viral</b> <b>isolates</b> contained the Leu to Val change at codon 74, and three other isolates with reduced susceptibility to ddI each contained changes at codons 65, 70, and 72. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to insert specific mutations in RT gene of proviral clone pNL 4 - 3. Analysis of virion-associated reverse transcriptase activity indicated that the Lys 70 Arg mutation resulted in an enzyme with 2 - to 4 -fold decreased susceptibility to ddATP.
