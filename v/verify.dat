5|$|Empiricist David Hume's {{requirement}} that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the logical positivist movement, particularly the philosopher A. J. Ayer. The movement proposed that, for {{a statement to}} hold meaning, it must be possible to <b>verify</b> its truthfulness empirically– with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to <b>verify.</b> Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued {{that he could not}} have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher Antony Flew proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that, in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{two pieces}} of work, one building on the other, that advance {{the state of the}} art of formal verification. The focus, in both cases, is on proving end-to-end correctness for realistic implementations of computer software. The first piece is a <b>verified</b> compiler for a stateful higher-order functional programming language, CakeML, which is packaged into a <b>verified</b> read-eval-print loop (REPL). The second piece is a <b>verified</b> theorem-prover kernel for higher-order logic (HOL), designed to run in the <b>verified</b> REPL. Self-compilation is the key idea behind the verification of the CakeML REPL, in particular, the new technique of proof-grounded bootstrapping of a <b>verified</b> com-piler. The <b>verified</b> compiler is bootstrapped within the theorem prover used for its verification, and then packaged into a REPL. The result is an implementa-tion of the REPL in machine code, <b>verified</b> against machine-code semantics. All the end-to-end correctness theorems linking this low-level implementation to its desired semantics are proved within the logic of the theorem prover. Therefor...|$|R
