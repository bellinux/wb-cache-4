40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} problem of mobile robots with {{distinct}} <b>visibility</b> <b>ranges</b> patrolling a curve. Assume a set of $k$ mobile robots (patrolmen) $a_ 1, a_ 2, [...] ., a_k$ walking along a unit-length curve {{in any of the}} two directions, not exceeding their maximal speeds. Every robot $a_i$ has a <b>range</b> of <b>visibility</b> $r_i$, representing the distance from its current position at which the robot can see in each direction along the curve. The goal of the patrolling problem is to find the perpetual movement of the robots minimizing the maximal time when a point of the curve remains unseen by any robot. We give the optimal patrolling algorithms for the case of close curve environment (known as the boundary patrolling problem in the robotics literature) and open curve (fence patrolling), when all robots have the same maximal speed. We briefly discuss the case of distinct speeds, showing that the boundary patrolling problem for robots with distinct <b>visibility</b> <b>ranges</b> is essentially different than the case of point visibility robots. We also give the optimal algorithm for fence patrolling by two robots with distinct speeds and <b>visibility</b> <b>ranges.</b> For the case when the environment in which the robots operate is a general graph, we show that the patrolling problem for robots with distinct <b>visibility</b> <b>ranges</b> is NP-hard, while it is known that the same problem for point-visibility robots has been known to have a polynomial-time solution...|$|R

50|$|The {{technique}} {{is to start}} at the estimated position of the target, at a distance above the bottom to provide the best view, and to swim in a cardinal direction a distance roughly equal to or slightly greater than the <b>visibility</b> <b>range.</b> The estimate of distance is commonly by kick counts, so using a whole number of kicks is necessary, and preferably a number which can be mentally accumulated by the diver.
