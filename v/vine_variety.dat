25|$|While California's wine regions can be {{generally}} {{classified as a}} Mediterranean climate, there are also regions with more continental dry climates.

He is considered the father of the Müller-Thurgau vine, which was crossed in 1882 and is the world's first scientifically-based new vine breed. With its success it displaced the old varieties, such as Elbling and Räuschling, and up until today has remained the most successful specifically cultivated vine variety: More than 41,000 ha are cultivated worldwide, which corresponds to almost three times the total vine area of Switzerland. It is most widespread in Germany; in German-speaking Switzerland it is still the most important white wine variety today. For a long time this <b>vine</b> <b>variety</b> was thought to be a crossing between Riesling and Silvaner. In 1998 an Austrian research team discovered, on the basis of molecular-genetic tests, that the crossing partners were not Riesling x Silvaner, but Riesling x Madeleine Royal.

Data were collected during a three years period (i. e, 2012, 2013 and 2014) over five wine-growing regions, covering more than 1000 ha, in Greece. Data for more than twenty different <b>vine</b> <b>varieties</b> were processed and analysed. In particular, reflectance hyperspectral data from a spectroradiometer (GER 1500, Spectra Vista Corporation, 350 - 1050 nm, 512 spectral bands) were calculated from the raw radiance values and then were correlated with the corresponding reflectance observations from the UAV and satellite data. Reflectance satellite data (WorldView- 2, 400 nm- 1040 nm, 8 spectral bands, DigitalGlobe), after the radiometric and atmospheric correction of the raw datasets, were classified towards the detection and the discrimination of the different <b>vine</b> <b>varieties.</b> The concurrent observations from in-situ hyperspectral, aerial hyperspectral and satellite multispectral data over the same vines were highly correlated.

In Dão, it was evaluated the influence of shoot density (23, 17 and 11 for linear meter of canopy) and qualitative cluster thinning at veraison. In Bairrada, the traditional vine trellising has been compared with the Lys system. In both conduction systems has been evaluated the influence of qualitative cluster thinning at veraison. In Vinhos Verdes, in the system LYS 2 / 3, has been studied the effect of shoot density (29 and 20 for linear meter of canopy) and leaf removal associated to qualitative cluster thinning at veraison. In these three regions, two of them that are not traditional places for this variety, the ‘Touriga Nacional’ reached high levels of yield and quality, in adjusted technological itineraries. Cluster thinning reduced yield in all cases, as it was expectable, with gains of PAC only in Bairrada.

Thus, there were determined: phenology of varieties, fertility and productivity for table varieties and wine varieties, the behavior of these varieties at the attack of the main diseases and phylloxera, physico-mechanical characteristics, the technological attributes of varieties, the physico-chemical characteristics of wines. For determination of the volatile compounds from grapes was used the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method. The <b>vine</b> <b>varieties</b> studied were: Valeria and Muscat de Pölöskei (table <b>vine</b> <b>varieties),</b> Seyval, Valérien and Purpuriu (varieties of wine). In ecopedoclimatic terms from the southern Romania, varieties mature in the ages II-III (Valeria), IV-V (Muscat de Pölöskei, Seyval and Purpuriu) and V-VI (Valérien). From {{the point of view}} of fertility varieties, Valeria and Valérien had the best behavior (over 80 % fertile shoots) and as productivity were noted the varieties Muscat de Pölöskei and Purpuriu with the absolute productivity index of 424, respectively 332 g. Towards the major diseases and phylloxera, the varieties behaved differently, thus, we see that the Valeria variety with an attack grade of 1 % at all diseases and phylloxera and the Seyval variety with an attack grade of 0 % at most diseases but with a significant sensitivity to mold (12 % attack degree). Regarding the accumulation of the sugars in the grape, the sugar content has varied between 168 and 212 g/L at the wine varieties and between 184 and 186 g/L at the table varieties, were noted the varieties Valeria and Seyval. Regarding the analysis of the main volatile compounds shows that limonene, hexanol, 2 -methyl propanol and 3 -methyl butanol is found in highest concentration in all varieties; concerning terpenes, at the expressing of olfactory characteristics of grapes, in the highest proportion is found limonene, in lower concentration are found terpenes as: myrcene, cymene, pinene...|$|R
