Nay the New Downing Street, I foresee, when once it has got its [...] "Industrial Regiments" [...] organized, will make these mainly do its fighting, what fighting there is; and so save immense sums. Or indeed, all citizens of the Commonwealth, as is the right and the interest of every free man in this world, will have themselves trained to arms; each citizen ready to defend his country with his own body and soul,--he is not worthy to have a country otherwise. In a State grounded on <b>veracities,</b> that would be the rule. Downing Street, if it cannot bethink itself of returning to the <b>veracities,</b> will have to vanish altogether! ...|$|R

5|$|The Apple River Fort Historic Foundation began {{attempting}} {{to locate the}} original site of the fort {{in the spring of}} 1995. Local tales told of the fort being situated on a hill not far from Main Street in Elizabeth. The group, unable to determine the <b>veracity</b> of the tale, hired an archaeologist to determine the location of the old frontier fortification.|$|E
5|$|The siege left several traces in {{the legends}} of the nascent Muslim world, {{although}} it is conflated with accounts of another expedition against the city a few years previously, led by the future Caliph Yazid I. As a result, the <b>veracity</b> of Theophanes's account has been questioned by recent scholarship, which places more emphasis on the Arabic and Syriac sources.|$|E

They might, possibly, not be {{impressions}} of a single day, but of two days or three; though in all human probability they were seen just as I have stated them;[102] but they are records of successive impressions, as plainly written as ever traveller's diary. All of them pure <b>veracities.</b> Therefore immortal.|$|R
60|$|It {{might have}} been a warning protest of the <b>veracities</b> against what they were doing; but the madness of sight-seeing, which spoils travel, was on them, and they {{delivered}} themselves up to it as they used in their ignorant youth, though now they knew its futility so well. They spared themselves nothing that they had time for, that day, and they felt falsely guilty for their omissions, as if they really had been duties to art and history which must be discharged, like obligations to one's maker and one's neighbor.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} {{accounts}} {{state that the}} congregation's first synagogue was built at South State and South streets in 1861 and burned by the Union Army in 1863, but the <b>veracity</b> of this claim is disputed. In 1867 the congregation constructed a wood frame building {{at the corner of}} South State and South streets. The building, which was used both as a schoolhouse and for prayer services, was the first synagogue in Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{authors have}} implicated Domitian {{in the death}} of his brother, either by {{directly}} accusing him of murder, or implying he left the ailing Titus for dead, even alleging that during his lifetime, Domitian was openly plotting against his brother. It is difficult to assess the factual <b>veracity</b> of these statements given the known bias of the surviving sources. Brotherly affection was likely at a minimum, but this was hardly surprising, considering that Domitian had barely seen Titus after the age of seven.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians, however, {{doubt the}} <b>veracity</b> of this theory. For one thing, notes Kenneth R. Beesley, the Deseret News and every book {{published}} in the alphabet prominently feature {{the key to the}} alphabet, and anyone without a key could have gotten a copy of A Journey to Great-Salt-Lake City, or traveled to Salt Lake City themselves and bought one. Contemporary scholars Richard F. Burton and Jules Remy also dismissed the secrecy argument, in 1860 and 1855 respectively.|$|E
60|$|It is this {{consideration}} that lends a certain air of futility even {{to all the}} inspired simplicities and thunderous <b>veracities</b> of Tolstoy. We feel that a man cannot make himself simple merely by warring on complexity; we feel, indeed, in our saner moments that a man cannot make himself simple at all. A self-conscious simplicity may well be far more intrinsically ornate than luxury itself. Indeed, {{a great deal of}} the pomp and sumptuousness of the world's history was simple in the truest sense. It was born of an almost babyish receptiveness; it was the work of men who had eyes to wonder and men who had ears to hear.|$|R

In the current era of big data, many traditional data management and analytic approaches may not be suitable for handling the big data due to their well-known 5 V's characteristics. Over the past few years, several systems and applications have developed to use cluster, cloud or grid computing to manage and analyze big data so as to support data science (e. g., knowledge discovery and data mining). In this paper, we present a knowledge-based system for social network analysis so as to support big data mining of interesting patterns from big social networks that are represented as graphs...|$|R

5|$|The {{battle was}} brought to greater public {{attention}} in 1992 by a CBC television docu-drama, The Valour and the Horror, which {{made a number of}} controversial claims about senior leadership in the Second World War and devoted one of its three episodes to the Black Watch attack on Verrières Ridge. The episode raised a spirited debate among the historical and veterans' communities and led to calls for apologies from the producers and an official investigation by the CBC Ombudsman into the <b>veracity</b> of the claims {{and the way in which}} they were presented.|$|E

5|$|A {{story was}} told that Ælfric {{introduced}} monks into the cathedral church of Christ Church, Canterbury, replacing the secular clerks that {{had taken over the}} foundation during the ninth century. Ælfric is said to have done this on the command of the pope. This story originally dates to soon after the Norman Conquest and originated with the monastic historians of Canterbury, and its <b>veracity</b> is unclear. He likely performed the marriage ceremony of King Æthelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy in 1002. A later tradition held that he consecrated a Bishop of Llandaff and two Bishops of St. David's in Wales, which, if true, would have meant extending Canterbury's jurisdiction into new territory.|$|E
60|$|His mind {{drifted away}} to still more general speculations, and always {{he was trying}} not to see the figure of Sir Isaac, grimly and yet meanly resolute--in possession. Always too like some {{open-mouthed}} yokel at a fair who knows nothing of the insult chalked upon his back, he disregarded how he himself coveted and desired and would if he could have gripped. He forgot his own watchful attention to Euphemia in the past, nor did he think what he might have been if Lady Harman had been his wife. It needed the chill <b>veracities</b> of the small hours to bring him to that. He thought now of crude egotism as having Sir Isaac's hands and Sir Isaac's eyes and Sir Isaac's position. He forgot any egotism he himself was betraying.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{cognitive}} radio systems, secondary users should determine correctly whether the primary user is absent or {{not in a}} certain spectrum within a short detection period. Traditional spectrum sensing schemes based on fixed threshold are sensitive to noise uncertainty, a fractional fluctuate of average noise power {{in a short time}} will lead to the accuracy of spectrum detection decreasing seriously. In this paper we propose a novel dynamic threshold energy detection algorithm in {{cognitive radio}} systems. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed strategy can combat the noise uncertainty effectively, and good detection accuracy can be attained, if a suitable detection threshold is chosen. That is, the proposed scheme can enhance the robustness of combatting the noise uncertainty and <b>veracities</b> of the spectrum sensing.

40|$|The {{generation}} of heterogeneous big data sources with ever increasing volumes, velocities and <b>veracities</b> over the he {{last few years}} has inspired the data science and research community to address the challenge of extracting knowledge form big data. Such a wealth of generated data across the board can be intelligently exploited to advance our knowledge about our environment, public health, critical infrastructure and security. In recent years we have developed generic approaches to process such big data at multiple levels for advancing decision-support. It specifically concerns data processing with semantic harmonisation, low level fusion, analytics, knowledge modelling with high level fusion and reasoning. Such approaches will be introduced and presented in context of the TRIDEC project results on critical {{oil and gas industry}} drilling operations and also the ongoing large eVacuate project on critical crowd behaviour detection in confined spaces...|$|R

In her dissent, Ginsburg opposed the majority's decision to defer to legislative findings that the procedure was not safe for women. Ginsburg focused her ire on the way Congress reached its findings and with the <b>veracity</b> of the findings. Joining the majority for Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , a case which struck down parts of a 2013 Texas law regulating abortion providers, Ginsburg also authored a short concurring opinion which was even more critical of the legislation at issue. She asserted the legislation was not aimed at protecting women's health, as Texas had claimed, but rather to impede women's access to abortions.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, Europe {{experienced}} {{a series of}} protests, rebellions and often violent upheavals that {{became known as the}} Revolutions of 1848. In France, a revolution led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the French Second Republic. Marx was supportive of such activity and having recently received a substantial inheritance from his father (withheld by his uncle Lionel Philips since his father's death in 1838) of either 6,000 or 5,000 francs he allegedly used a third of it to arm Belgian workers who were planning revolutionary action. Although the <b>veracity</b> of these allegations is disputed, the Belgian Ministry of Justice accused Marx of it, subsequently arresting him and he was forced to flee back to France, where with a new republican government in power he believed that he would be safe.|$|E

On {{the other}} hand, the men whose quiet {{patience}} and exquisite manual dexterity are at present employed in producing large and costly plates, {{such as that}} of the Belle Jardinière de Florence, by M.

The same number of hours of labor, applied with the like conscientious skill, would multiply precious likenesses of the real picture, full of subtle <b>veracities</b> which no steel line could approach, and conveying, to thousands, true knowledge and unaffected enjoyment of painting; while the finished plate lies uncared for in the portfolio of the virtuoso, serving only, so far as it is seen in the printseller's window by the people, to make them think that sacred painting must always be dull, and unnatural.|$|R

Most drawing of reflections is at once confused and hard; but Nature's is at once intelligible and tender. Generally, {{at the edge of the}} water, you ought not to see where reality ceases and reflection begins; as the image loses itself you ought to keep all its subtle and varied <b>veracities,</b> with the most exquisite softening of its edge.

The <b>veracity</b> of Volkov's account, which he claims is rooted in interviews with Shostakovich, has been debated.
