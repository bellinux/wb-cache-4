50|$|Subtelomeric {{transcripts}} are pseudogenes (transcribed genes producing RNA sequences not {{translated into}} protein) and gene families. In humans, they code for olfactory receptors, immunoglobulin heavy chains, and zinc-finger proteins. In other species, several parasites such as Plasmodium and Trypanosoma brucei have developed sophisticated evasion mechanisms {{to adapt to}} the hostile environment posed by the host, such as exposing variable surface antigens to escape the immune system. Genes coding for surface antigens in these organisms are located at subtelomeric regions, and it has been speculated that this preferred location facilitates gene switching and expression, and the generation of new variants. For example, the genes belonging to the var family in Plasmodium falciparum (agent of malaria) code for the PfEMP1 (Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1), a major virulence factor of erythrocytic stages, var genes are mostly localized in subtelomeric regions. Antigenic variation is orchestrated by epigenetic factors including monoallelic var transcription at separate spatial domains at the nuclear periphery (nuclear pore), differential histone marks on otherwise identical var genes, and var silencing mediated by telomeric heterochromatin. Other factors such as non-coding RNA produced in subtelomeric regions adjacent or within var genes may contribute as well to antigenic variation. In Trypanosoma brucei (agent of sleeping sickness), <b>variable</b> <b>surface</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> (VSG) antigenic variation is a relevant mechanism used by the parasite to evade the host immune system. VSG expression is exclusively subtelomeric and occurs either by in situ activation of a silent VSG gene or by DNA rearrangement that inserts an internal silent copy of a VSG gene into an active telomeric expression site. To contrast with Plasmodium falciparum, in Trypanosoma brucei, antigenic variation is orchestrated by epigenetic and genetic factors. In Pneumocystis jirovecii major surface glycoprotein (MSG) gene family cause antigenic variation. MSG genes are like boxes at chromosome ends and only the MSG gene at the unique locus UCS (upstream conserved sequence) is transcribed. Different MSG genes can occupy the expression site (UCS), suggesting that recombination can take a gene from a pool of silent donors and install it at the expression site, possibly via crossovers, activating transcription of a new MSG gene, and changing the surface antigen of Pneumocystis jirovecii. Switching at the expression site is probably facilitated by the subtelomeric locations of expressed and silent MSG genes. A second subtelomeric gene family, MSR, is not strictly regulated at the transcriptional level, but may contribute to phenotypic diversity. Antigenic variation in P. jirovecii is dominated by genetic regulation.|$|E

Thus we have investigated antibody responses to surface exposed epitopes of the <b>variable</b> <b>surface</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> in Trypanosoma congolense-infected N'Dama (trypanotolerant) and Boran (susceptible) cattle. Similar titres and isotypes were found in both N'Damas and Borans indicating that trypanotolerance is not associated with superior antibody-mediated destruction of trypanosomes. However, significant differences in antibody responses to cryptic VSG epitopes and non-trypanosome antigens were identified. Trypanosusceptible Boran cattle had low IgG 1 responses to cryptic epitopes but high IgM responses to non-trypanosome antigens such as 3 -galactosidase. In contrast the N'Dama cattle had significantly higher IgG 1 responses to cryptic VSG epitopes and negligible responses to 3 -galactosidase.

For analysis of biological function, bovine monocytes were used which had been incubated with bovine interferon y (primed) or with culture medium (unprimed).

The other was directed against determinants on the Protozoan, parasitic blood flagellate of livestock and wildlife in Africa, Trypanosoma brucei, develops in and is transmitted by tsetse flies (Glossina spp.).

Previous approaches to universal vaccination have required protracted multi-dose immunizations. Here we evaluate a single dose universal vaccine strategy using recombinant adenoviruses (rAd) expressing the conserved influenza virus antigens matrix 2 and nucleoprotein. In BALB/c mice, administration of rAd via the intranasal route was superior to intramuscular immunization for induction of mucosal responses and for protection against highly virulent H 1 N 1, H 3 N 2, or H 5 N 1 influenza virus challenge. Mucosally vaccinated mice not only survived, but had little morbidity and reduced lung virus titers. Protection was observed as early as 2 weeks post-immunization, and lasted at least 10 months, as did antibodies and lung T cells with activated phenotypes. Virus-specific IgA correlated with but was not essential for protection, as demonstrated in studies with IgA-deficient animals.

The relative distribution of all the glycosyltransferases was remarkably similar for the three species of African trypanosomes studied. The Golgi complex fraction contained most of the gaIactosyltransferase activity followed by the smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum fractions. The dolichol-dependent mannosyltransferase activities were highest for the rough endoplasmic reticulum, lower for the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and lowest for the Golgi complex. Although the dolicholindependent form of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase was essentially similar in all the fractions, the dolichol-dependent form of this enzyme was much higher in the endoplasmic reticulum fractions than in the Golgi complex fraction. Inhibition of this latter activity in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum fraction by tunicamycin A, suggests that core glycosylation of the <b>variable</b> <b>surface</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> may occur in this organelle and not in the rough endoplasmic reticulum as previously assumed.

40|$|Sera from {{goats and}} cattle that were {{infected}} with 2 T. vivax clones (ILDat 1. 2 and ILDat 2. 1) derived from different stocks were analysed for antibody activity against the <b>variable</b> <b>surface</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> (VSGs) of the infecting clones by ELISA and immune lysis. To obtain purified VSG, lysed trypanosomes were separated on dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were copper stained and the VSG protein band was excised from the gel. After destaining, the proteins were electroeluted from the gel slices {{and used as}} antigens in ELISA. High titres of IgM and IgG 1 antibodies and lytic antibodies against the VSG of the infecting clone were detected. The IgG 1 response appeared about 4 days later than the IgM response. IgG 2 antibodies were only detected in goats and cattle that were infected with ILDat 1. 2. Two goats and 2 calves that were infected with ILDat 1. 2 showed recurrent peaks in lytic activity and of IgM and IgG 1 antibody activity to the VSG of the infecting variable antigenic type (VAT). Two goats that were infected with ILDat 2. 1 showed a similar pattern, but in 2 other goats there was a recurrent peak only in the IgM class. Recurrent peaks of antibody activity to the VSG of ILDat 1. 2 and ILDat 2. 1 were not detected in the sera of goats that had been inoculated with irradiated trypanosomes or that had been infected with an unrelated T. vivax clone. The recurrence of antibody peaks against the VSG of infection VATs suggests that trypanosomes with completely or partially identical surface determinants reappear during T. vivax infection of ruminants...|$|R
40|$|Groups {{of cattle}} were inoculated {{intravenously}} with cloned populations of bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei or Trypanosoma congolense. All five steers infected with T. brucei ILTat 2. 1 and {{six of the}} eight steers infected with T. congolense IL 13 -E 14 became aparasitemic within 16 and 32 weeks postinfection, respectively. Examination of sera from animals infected with T. brucei by indirect immunofluorescence and neutralization assays revealed the presence of antibodies against all the metacyclic variable antigen types (VATs) of the infecting clone. The neutralizing capacity of the sera increased with the course of infection from 1 : 10 at 2 months to 1 : 100 at 3 to 4 months postinfection. The recovered animals were completely immune to challenge by Glossina morsitans subsp. centralis infected with clone IL Tat 2. 1, which had initiated the infection, {{as well as with}} another clone (IL Tat 2. 2) belonging to the same serodeme, but they were susceptible to a tsetse-transmitted heterologous challenge with isolate STIB 367 -H. Similar results were obtained with sera from T. congolense IL 13 -E 14 -infected steers. The six steers infected with a different T. congolense ILNat 3. 1 clone did not recover spontaneously; however, 2 months postinfection, sera from five of them also contained neutralizing antibodies against ILNat 3. 1 metacyclic VATs. These results indicate that some of the bloodstream VATs that arise {{during the course of a}} chronic infection possess surface epitopes in their <b>variable</b> <b>surface</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> that are identical to those of the metacyclic VATs. It is suggested that in chronic infection, the infecting trypanosomes could exhaust their VAT repertoire, including those that cross-react with metacyclics, thereby leading to both "self-cure" and subsequent immunity to homologous cyclically transmitted challenge...|$|R
