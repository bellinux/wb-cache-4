5|$|The neck {{consisted}} of nine cervical vertebrae, {{which would have}} formed an S-shaped curve, {{as indicated by the}} shape of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> in the side view of the skeleton. The <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> of the anterior cervical vertebrae are shaped like a parallelogram, those of the middle are rectangular and those of the posterior show a trapezoid shape. The trunk was short, consisting of 12 dorsal and 6 fused sacral vertebrae. The tail was long compared to the body; although incompletely known, it probably {{consisted of}} 34 to 37 caudal vertebrae. The dorsal spine was stiffened by ossified tendons, beginning with the fourth dorsal vertebra. This feature is present in many other ornithischian dinosaurs and probably countered stress caused by bending forces acting on the spine during bipedal locomotion. In contrast to many other ornithischians, the tail of Heterodontosaurus lacked ossified tendons, and was therefore probably flexible. It had a long, narrow pelvis and a pubis which resembled those possessed by more advanced ornithischians.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{features}} of the cervical vertebrae which distinguish Dinocephalosaurus from other protorosaurs include the low and keel-like neural spines, and the anterior and posterior (rear) articular surfaces of the vertebrae both being concave (amphicoelous). In the first ten vertebrae, the bottom margin is also concave. The long, slender cervical ribs bear frontal projections free of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies,</b> which are also unique to Dinocephalosaurus. These ribs are aligned along the neck and bridge multiple consecutive vertebral joints, from two or three consecutive joints in the anterior the neck to five or six in the posterior neck. There appear to be no distinct processes on the vertebrae for articulation with the ribs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Study Design and Aims This was an {{observational}} {{pilot study}} of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> growth plates in scoliosis involving high-resolution coronal plane magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and histological examination. One {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> growth plates in scoliosis demonstrated abnormalities on MR imaging. A second aim was to determine if a relationship existed between MR and histological abnormalities in these <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> growth plates. Methods MR imaging sequences of 18 patients demonstrated the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> growth plates well enough to detect gross abnormalities/deficient areas/zones. Histological examination of ten <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> growth plates removed during routine scoliosis surgery was performed. Observational histological comparison with MR images was possible in four cases. Results Four of the 18 MR images demonstrated spines with normal curvature and normal <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> growth plates. In 13 scoliotic spines, convex and concave side growth plate deficiencies were observed most frequently at or near the apex of the curve. One MR image demonstrated a 55 Â° kyphosis and no convex or concave side deficiencies. The degree of <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> wedging was independent of the presence of <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> growth plate deficiency. Histological abnormalities of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> growth plates were demonstrated in four with MR imaging abnormalities. Conclusion This study demonstrated MR image abnormalities of scoliotic <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> growth plates compared to controls. A qualitative relationship was demonstrated between MR imaging and histological abnormalities. The finding that <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> growth plate deficiencies occurred both on the convex and concave sides of the spine, closest to the apical vertebra of the scoliosis curve, implied that they are less likely to be the result of adaptive changes to the physical forces involved in the scoliotic deformity. One explanation is that they represent a primary disturbance of growth. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Stereotactic {{radiosurgery}} (SRS) is {{an emerging}} treatment modality for malignant spinal tumors. After SRS, some patients suffered from pain aggravation due to development of vertebral compression fracture (VCF). In these cases, surgery should be considered. Methods: This {{study consisted of}} 72 patients who underwent SRS due to spinal tumors. In them, whether post-SRS VCF developed or not was investigated. We retrospectively analyzed their medical records and radiological imaging data. VCF was diagnosed with X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The incidence, time to development and risk factors for VCF were investigated. Age, sex, whole <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> involvement rate, <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> osteolysis rate, pre-SRS spinal deformity, spinal instability neoplastic score (SINS), spinal canal encroachment, lesion level, and radiation dose were ana-lyzed as potential risk factors. A multi-variate logistic regression model was used for statistical analysis. Results: In our study population, VCF was observed in 26 patients (36 %). The mean time to VCF development was 1. 5 months. Using uni-variate analyses, the significant risk factors were pre-SRS spinal deformity, SINS, <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> osteol-ysis rate, and whole <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> involvement rate. However, using multi-variate analyses, the only significant risk factor was <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> osteolysis rate. The patients whose <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> was destroyed by more than 60 % showed an 8. 4 times higher risk of VCF {{than those who had}} <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> destruction of less than 60 % (p= 0. 016).

40|$|Abstract Background Metastatic {{diseases}} and infections frequently involve the spine. This {{is the result}} of seeding of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> by tumor cells or bacteria delivered by venous blood from Batson's plexus, which is hypothesized to enter the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> via the epidural veins. Isolated spinal segments deform significantly at the bony end plate when under compression. This deformation could cause a volume change of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> and may be accompanied by retrograde flow of venous blood. To date, this process has not been investigated quantitatively. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the volume changes of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> and basivertebral vein for a <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> under compression. Methods A three-dimensional finite element mesh model of the L 4 segment with both adjacent discs was modified from a 3 -D computed tomography scan image. An octagon representing the basivertebral vein was introduced into the center of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> in the model. Four compressive orientations (1500 N) were applied on the top disc. The volume change of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> model and the basivertebral vein were then computed. Results The volume change of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> was about 0. 1 cm 3 (16. 3 % of the basivertebral vein) for the four loading conditions. The maximum cross-sectional area reductions of the basivertebral vein and volume reduction were 1. 54 % and 1. 02 %, for uniform compression. Conclusion Our study quantified the small but significant volume change of a modeled <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> and cross-sectional areas and that of the basivertebral vein, due to the inward bulging of the end plate under compression. This volume change could initiate the reverse flow of blood from the epidural venous system and cause seeding of tumors or bacterial cells. </p...|$|R
40|$|Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty {{have become}} common {{surgical}} techniques {{for the treatment}} of vertebral compression fractures. Vertebroplasty involves the percutaneous injection of bone cement into the cancellous bone of a <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> with the goals of pain alleviation and preventing further loss of <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> height. Kyphoplasty utilizes an inflatable balloon to create a cavity for the cement with the additional potential goals of restoring height and reducing kyphosis. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are effective treatment options for the reduction of pain associated with <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> compression fractures. Biomechanical studies demonstrate that kyphoplasty is initially superior for increasing <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> height and reducing kyphosis, but these gains are lost with repetitive loading. Complications secondary to extravasation of cement include compression of neural elements and venous embolism. These complications are rare but more common with vertebroplasty. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are both safe and effective procedures {{for the treatment of}} <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> compression fractures...|$|R
40|$|Background Context. Computed tomography- (CT-) guided fine-needle {{aspiration}} biopsy of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> is {{an important}} tool in the diagnostic evaluation of vertebral osteomyelitis. The procedure is considered simple to perform and it is considered a safe procedure with few complications. Purpose. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe an unusual complication due to a CT-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> of L 3, to better understand the relationship between surgical procedure and complication, and to reflect on how to avoid it. Study Design/Setting. Case report and literature review. Methods. The medical records, laboratory findings, and radiographic imaging studies of an 11 -year-old boy, with an unusual complication due to a CT-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> of L 3, were reviewed. Results. We report a case of vertebral osteomyelitis of L 3 caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Following a computed tomography-guided aspiration biopsy of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> of L 3, vertebral osteomyelitis rapidly progressed into the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> of L 4 as well as the L 3 -L 4 disk. Conclusions. Based on the present case, one should consider that a CT-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> may be complicated by a progression of a vertebral osteomyelitis into both the intervertebral disk and also the adjacent <b>vertebral</b> <b>body...</b>|$|R
25|$|Lampreys have {{vertebral}} arches, {{but nothing}} resembling the <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> {{found in all}} higher vertebrates. Even the arches are discontinuous, consisting of separate pieces of arch-shaped cartilage around the spinal cord {{in most parts of}} the body, changing to long strips of cartilage above and below in the tail region. Hagfishes lack a true vertebral column, and are therefore not properly considered vertebrates, but a few tiny neural arches are present in the tail.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} ligaments {{involved in the}} holding together of the vertebrae in the column, and in the column's movement. The anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments extend {{the length of the}} vertebral column along the front and back of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies.</b> The interspinous ligaments connect the adjoining spinous processes of the vertebrae. The supraspinous ligament extends the length of the spine running along the back of the spinous processes, from the sacrum to the seventh cervical vertebra. From there it is continuous with the nuchal ligament.|$|E
25|$|The main {{radiographic}} {{features of}} generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency. Frequent complications of osteoporosis are vertebral fractures for which spinal radiography can help considerably in diagnosis and follow-up. Vertebral height measurements can objectively be made using plain-film X-rays by using several {{methods such as}} height loss together with area reduction, particularly when looking at vertical deformity in T4-L4, or by determining a spinal fracture index that takes into account the number of vertebrae involved. Involvement of multiple <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> leads to kyphosis of the thoracic spine, leading to what is known as dowager's hump.|$|E
40|$|The {{shape of}} the L 5 <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> was {{analyzed}} using a computerized tomography (CT) scan. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} is to determine if the <b>vertebral</b> L 5 <b>body</b> shape varies depending on the height of the CT slices through the L 5 pedicle. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The morphometry of L 5 has been studied to help the introduction of pedicular screws. The {{shape of the}} <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> has been seldom looked into, and the findings obtained show a triangular shape and hemispherical shape, supposedly owing to interpersonal variability. The hemisphere shape enables pedicular screws to be introduced nonconvergently, whereas the triangular shape enables pedicular screws to be introduced at a convergent angle but posing the risk of cortical perforation unless these guidelines are followed. METHODS: Abdominal CT multicut with 64 crowns was performed in 101 consecutive patients with diverse indications. Width of CT slices was with a 1 -mm reconstruction increase. We selected one axial slice that passed through the upper part of the pedicle and another one that passed through the lower part of the pedicle and compared next parameters in both cuts: pedicular cortical width, pedicular endostal width, pedicular angle, <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> length, <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> width, <b>vertebral</b> perimeter angles, and visual appearance of <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> shape. RESULTS: We found statistical differences between all values except the anterior vertebral perimeter angle on comparing values of upper part with values of lower part and visual <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> shape was different in 93 % of vertebrae. In the upper part the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> is hemispherical whereas in the lower part it is triangular. CONCLUSION: In most cases, the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> shape is hemispherical in the upper part of the pedicle and triangular in the lower part of the pedicle. It means that in the lower part pedicular screws must be introduced at a more convergent angle than in the upper part if we do not want to break any cortical of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body...</b>|$|R

Aim: This study aims at describing the Neurospinal Academy (NSA) technique {{as an attempt}} to achieve an approximation of the fracture line to the axis body, which may be used for Type II and IIA patients with severe displacement and angulation. Settings and Design: NSA technique both pars or pedicle screws are placed bicortically to ensure that anterior surface of C 2 <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> will be crossed 1 - 2 mm. A rod is prepared in suitable length and curve to connect the two screws. For placing the rod, sufficient amount of bone is resected from the C 2 spinous process. C 2 <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> is pulled back by means of the screws that crossed the anterior surface of C 2 <b>vertebral</b> <b>body.</b> Materials and Methods: Hangman II and IIA patient are treated with NSA technique.

Conclusions: In Hangmanâ²s fractures Type II and IIA with severe <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> and pedicle displacement, NSA technique is an effective and reliable treatment alternative for the approximation of posterior elements to the C 2 <b>vertebral</b> <b>body,</b> which is tilted, angulated, and dislocated...|$|R
25|$|Lumbar disc herniations {{occur in}} the lower back, most often between {{the fourth and fifth}} lumbar <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> or between the fifth and the sacrum. Symptoms can affect the lower back, buttocks, thigh, anal/genital region (via the perineal nerve), and may radiate into the foot and/or toe.

The femoral nerve can also be affected and cause the patient to experience a numb, tingling feeling throughout one or both legs and even feet or even a burning feeling in the hips and legs. A hernia in the lumbar region often compresses the nerve root exiting at the level below the disk. Thus, a herniation of the L4/5 disc will compress the L5 nerve root.|$|E
25|$|The general {{structure}} of human vertebrae is fairly typical of {{that found in}} mammals, reptiles, and birds. The shape of the vertebral body does, however, vary somewhat between different groups. In mammals, such as humans, it typically has flat upper and lower surfaces, while in reptiles the anterior surface commonly has a concave socket into which the expanded convex face of the next vertebral body fits. Even these patterns are only generalisations, however, {{and there may be}} variation in form of the vertebrae {{along the length of the}} spine even within a single species. Some unusual variations include the saddle-shaped sockets between the cervical vertebrae of birds and the presence of a narrow hollow canal running down the centre of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> of geckos and tuataras, containing a remnant of the notochord.|$|E
25|$|Basal Ichthyopterygia, {{like their}} land-dwelling ancestors, still had {{vertebrae}} that possessed {{a full set}} of processes that allowed them to interlock and articulate, forming a vertebral column supporting the weight of the body. As ichthyosaurs were fully aquatic, their bodies were supported by the Archimedes force exerted by the water; in other words, they were buoyant. Therefore, the vertebral processes had lost much of their function. Early ichthyosaurs proper had rear dorsal vertebrae that had become disc-shaped, like those of typical fishes. With more derived species, the front dorsals also became discs. Gradually, most processes were lost, including those for rib attachment. The <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> became much shorter. The front and rear sides of the discs were hollowed out, resulting in a so-called amphicoelous condition. A transverse cross-section of such a vertebra has an hourglass shape. This morphology is unique within the Amniota and makes discerning ichthyosaur vertebrae from those of other marine reptiles easy. The only process that kept its function was the spine at the top, serving as an attachment for the dorsal muscles. However, even the spine became a simple structure. The neural arch, of which it was an outgrowth, typically no longer fused to the vertebral centre.|$|E
