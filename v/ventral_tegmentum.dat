50|$|The {{dopamine}} or dopaminergic system {{consists of}} several pathways, originating from the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum</b> or substantia nigra as examples. It acts on dopamine receptors.|$|E
50|$|Almost {{all areas}} {{receiving}} projections from the VTA project back to it. Thus, the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum</b> is reciprocally {{connected with a}} wide range of structures throughout the brain suggesting that it has a role in the control of function in the phylogenetically new and highly developed neocortex, as well as that of the phylogenetically older limbic areas.|$|E
50|$|The mesocortical pathway is a {{dopamine}}rgic pathway {{that connects}} the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum</b> to the prefrontal cortex.

It is essential to the normal cognitive function of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (part of the frontal lobe), and is thought to be involved in cognitive control, motivation, and emotional response.|$|E
50|$|Group A10 is {{the largest}} group of dopaminergic cells in the <b>ventral</b> {{midbrain}} <b>tegmentum</b> of rodents and primates.

After large injections of the fluorescent retrograde tracer, Evans blue, into the frontal cortex, many neural somata of the <b>ventral</b> midbrain <b>tegmentum</b> were retrogradely labeled; most of the retrogradely labeled neurons also showed catecholamine fluorescence. However, some labeled cells (10 - 15 %) did not show any catecholamine fluorescence.

50|$|According {{to the new}} disease model, {{rather than}} being a disease in the {{conventional}} sense, addiction is a disease of choice. That is, it is a disorder of {{the parts of the}} brain necessary to make proper decisions. As one becomes addicted to cocaine, the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum</b> nucleus accumbens in the brain is the organ. The defect is stress-induced hedonic regulation.|$|E
50|$|Neurobiologists {{have often}} had great {{difficulty}} distinguishing the VTA in humans and other primate brains from the substantia nigra (SN) and surrounding nuclei. Originally, the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum</b> was {{designated as a}} ‘nucleus’, but over time ‘area’ became the more appropriate term used because of the heterogeneous cytoarchitectonic features {{of the region and}} the lack of clear borders that separate it from adjacent regions. Because of the selective limbic-related afferents to the VTA, the cells of the VTA are given the designation A10 to differentiate them from surrounding cells.|$|E
5000|$|Drug {{addiction}} may {{be regarded}} as a disease of the brain reward system. This system, closely related to the system of emotional arousal, is located predominantly in the limbic structures of the brain. Its existence was proved by demonstration of the [...] "pleasure centers," [...] that were discovered as the location from which electrical self-stimulation is readily evoked. The main neurotransmitter involved in the reward is dopamine, but other monoamines and acetylcholine may also participate. The anatomical core of the reward system are dopaminergic neurons of the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum</b> that project to the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, prefrontal cortex and other forebrain structures.|$|E
40|$|In the rat brain, {{destruction}} of dopaminergic cell groups by injections of 6 -hydroxydopamine into the <b>ventral</b> mesencephalic <b>tegmentum</b> results in large decreases {{in the number}} of neurotensin binding sites in the mesencephalon and the striatum. In contrast, these lesions produce an increase {{in the number of}} 125 I-labeled neurotensin binding sites in the lateral part of the prefrontal cortex despite a large decrease in cortical dopamine levels. Increases in the number of 125 I-labeled neurotensin binding sites in this cortical area as well as in the entorhinal cortex, the nucleus accumbens, and the central part of the striatum were also obtained after chronic blockade of dopamine neurotransmission by a long-acting neuroleptic pipotiazine palmitic ester. We propose that dopamine inputs regulate the density of postsynaptic neurotensin binding sites through cortical and subcortical dopamine receptors. Therefore, some of the clinical effects of neuroleptics in schizophrenic patients could be partly related to changes in neurotensin neurotransmission...|$|R

40|$|We {{generated}} a transgenic mouse line named E 1 -Ngn 2 /Cre that expresses Cre recombinase and GFP {{under the control}} of the E 1 enhancer element of the gene Ngn 2 (Scardigli et al. : Neuron 31 : 203 – 217, 2001). Crerecombinase activity and GFP fluorescence are consistent with the reported expression pattern controlled by the E 1 -Ngn 2 enhancer. Recombination was detected in the progenitor domains p 1 and p 2 in the ventricular zone of the neural tube and in distinct domains of the pretectum, the dorsal and <b>ventral</b> thalamus, the <b>tegmentum</b> of the mesencephalon, and the hindbrain. In the developing cortex, Cre-recombinase activity is confined to a subpopulation of progenitors predominantly in the region of the ventral and lateral pallium.

50|$|The {{ventral tegmental area}} (VTA) (tegmentum is Latin for covering), {{also known}} as the ventral tegmental area of Tsai, or simply <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum,</b> is a group of neurons located close to the midline {{on the floor of the}} midbrain. The VTA is the origin of the {{dopamine}}rgic cell bodies of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system and other dopamine pathways; it is widely implicated in the drug and natural reward circuitry of the brain. The VTA plays an important role in a number of processes, including cognition, motivation, orgasm, and intense emotions relating to love, as well as several psychiatric disorders. Neurons in the VTA project to numerous areas of the brain, ranging from the prefrontal cortex to the caudal brainstem and several regions in between.|$|E
50|$|The {{midbrain}} {{is divided}} into three parts. The first is the tectum, (Latin:roof), which forms the ceiling. The tectum comprises the paired structure of the superior and inferior colliculi and is the dorsal covering of the cerebral aqueduct. The inferior colliculus, is the principal midbrain nucleus of the auditory pathway and receives input from several peripheral brainstem nuclei, as well as inputs from the auditory cortex. Its inferior brachium (arm-like process) reaches to the medial geniculate nucleus of the diencephalon. Superior to the inferior colliculus, the superior colliculus marks the rostral midbrain. It is involved in the special sense of vision and sends its superior brachium to the lateral geniculate body of the diencephalon. The second part is the tegmentum which forms the floor of the midbrain, and is ventral to the cerebral aqueduct. Several nuclei, tracts, and the reticular formation are contained here. The third part, the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum</b> is composed of paired cerebral peduncles. These transmit axons of upper motor neurons.|$|E
50|$|The {{nucleus accumbens}} and the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum</b> {{are the primary}} sites where {{addictive}} drugs act. The following are commonly considered to be addictive: heroin, cocaine, alcohol, opiates, nicotine, amphetamine, and their synthetic analogs. These drugs alter the neuromodulatory influence of dopamine on the processing of reinforcement signals by prolonging the action of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens or by stimulating the activation of neurons there {{and also in the}} VTA. The most common drugs of abuse stimulate the release of dopamine, which creates both their rewarding and the psychomotor effects. Compulsive drug-taking behaviors are a result of the permanent functional changes in the mesolimbic dopamine system arising from repetitive dopamine stimulation. Molecular and cellular adaptations are responsible for a sensitized dopamine activity in the VTA and along the mesolimbic dopamine projection in response to drug abuse. In the VTA of addicted individuals, the activity of the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase increases, as does the ability of these neurons to respond to excitatory inputs. The latter effect is secondary to increases in the activity of the transcription factor CREB and the up regulation of GluR1, an important subunit of AMPA receptors for glutamate. These alterations in neural processing could account for the waning influence of adaptive emotional signals in the operation of decision making faculties as drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviors become habitual and compulsive.|$|E
40|$|The {{organization}} of the main dopaminergic cell groups in the brain, located in the <b>ventral</b> mesencephalic <b>tegmentum,</b> and the circuits {{in which they are}} inserted are reviewed here, with emphasis on rodents. Subdivisions based on cytoarchitecture (substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area and related nuclei, retrobulbal field), dopaminergic phenotype (A 8, A 9 and A 10 cell groups) and organization in dorsal and ventral tiers are discussed and compared. Dendritic release and gap junctional protein expression, interactions with glial cells, molecular and cellular features of the chemical repertoire of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and their main inputs are also reviewed. An account is given on basal ganglia circuits, including the {{organization of}} the direct, inderct and hyperdirect pathways of information processing and dopamine modulation of these pathways. Data on the dopaminergic innervation of limbic structures, including the extended amygdala, and the distribution and laminar organization of dopaminergic fibers in the cerebral cortex are summarized. The last part of the chapter focuses on the distribution of dopamine receptor subtypes and their relative densities in different brain structures. For each of the D 1, D 2, D 3, D 4 and D 1 B/ 5 receptors, an overview and distributional maps are provided, followed by data on their localization in the rat basal ganglia, cerebral cortex and limbic system, and a comparison with findings obtained in the human and nonhuman primate brain. This chapter thus presents an overview, at the moecular, cellular and system levels, of central dopaminergic circuits involved in state-setting modulatory systems, generation and integration of motor behavior, cognitive functions and reward mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the brain}} plays {{a crucial role}} in the control of micturition, little is known about the {{structures}} involved. Identification of these areas is important because their dysfunction is thought to cause urge incontinence, a major problem in the elderly. In the cat, three areas in the brainstem and diencephalon are specifically implicated in the control of micturition: the dorsomedial pontine tegmentum, the periaqueductal grey, and the preoptic area of the hypothalamus. PET scans were used to test whether these areas are also involved in human micturition. Seventeen right-handed male volunteers were scanned during the following four conditions: (i) 15 min prior to micturition during urine withholding; (ii) during micturition; (iii) 15 min after micturition; (iv) 30 min after micturition. Ten of the 17 volunteers were able to micturate during scanning. Micturition was associated with increased blood flow in the right dorsomedial pontine tegmentum, the periaqueductal grey, the hypothalamus and the right inferior frontal gyrus. Decreased blood flow was found in the right anterior cingulate gyrus when urine was withheld. The other seven volunteers were not able to micturate during scanning, although they had a full bladder and tried vigorously to do so. In this group, during these unsuccessful attempts to micturate, increased blood pow was Sound in the right <b>ventral</b> pontine <b>tegmentum,</b> which corresponds with the hypothesis, formulated from results in cats, that this area controls the motor neurons of the pelvic poor Increased blood pow was also found in the right inferior frontal gyrus during unsuccessful attempts at micturition, and decreased blood pow in the right anterior cingulate gyrus was found during the withholding of urine. The results suggest that, as that of the cat, the human brainstem contains specific nuclei responsible for the control of micturition, and that the cortical and pontine micturition sites are predominantly on the right side...|$|R
40|$|Experiments in the cat {{have led}} to a concept of how the CNS {{controls}} micturition. In a previous study this concept was tested in a PET study in male volunteers, It was demonstrated that specific brainstem and forebrain areas are activated during micturition, It was unfortunate that this study did not involve women, because such results are important for understanding urge incontinence, which occurs more frequently in women than in men. Therefore, a similar study was done in 18 right-handed women, who were scanned during the following four conditions: (i) 15 min prior to micturition (urine withholding); (ii) during micturition; (iii) 15 min after micturition; and (iv) 30 min after micturition, Of the 18 volunteers, 10 were able to micturate during scanning and eight were not, despite trying vigorously. Micturition appeared to be associated with significantly increased blood flow in the right dorsal pontine tegmentum and the right inferior frontal gyrus, Decreased blood flow was found in the right anterior cingulate gyrus during urine withholding. The eight volunteers who were not able to micturate during scanning did not show significantly increased regional cerebral blood flow in the right dorsal, but did so in the right <b>ventral</b> pontine <b>tegmentum,</b> In the cat this region controls the motor neurons of the pelvic floor. In the same unsuccessful micturition group, increased blood flow was also found in the right inferior frontal gyrus, In all 18 volunteers, decreased blood flow in the right anterior cingulate gyrus was found during the period when they had to withhold their urine prior to the micturition condition. The results suggest that in women rind in men the same specific nuclei exist in the pontine tegmentum responsible for the control of micturition. The results also indicate that the cortical and pontine micturition sites are more active on the right than on the left side...|$|R

40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} if sensitization to nicotine could be assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with BOLD contrast. Sensitization describes a phenomenon whereby subsequent doses of a drug produce greater responses than the initial dose. Robust locomotor sensitization was demonstrated in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by the daily administration of nicotine 0. 4 mg/kg over 5 days. In parallel experiments, brain activity was monitored using fMRI in animals receiving their first dose (acute) or fifth dose of nicotine (sensitized) and appropriate saline controls. Compared to the acute nicotine animals, brain activity in the sensitized animals demonstrated prolonged BOLD activation in response to nicotine in the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, ventral pallidum and <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum,</b> and more intense peak activation in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum.</b> In addition, sensitization was associated with a relative decrease in activation in the anterior cingulate gyrus. Furthermore, despite the rich endowment of nicotinic receptors in the visual cortex there was no change in activation with sensitization, thus establishing the specificity of the observed pattern of regional activation and inhibition. Taken together, the current studies support the premise that nicotine sensitization is accompanied by changes in brain activation including a sensitized BOLD response in the extended limbic system that may subserve the process of dependence...|$|E
40|$|Anatomical {{findings}} are presented that identify cortical and subcortical sources of afferents to the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (NRTP) and basal pontine nuclei. Projections {{from the middle}} temporal visual area (MT), medial superior temporal visual area (MST), lateral intraparietal area (LIP), and areas 7 a. and 7 b to the basal pontine nuclei were studied using H- 3 -leucine autoradiography. The results complemented a parallel study of retrograde neuronal labeling attributable to injecting WGA-HRP into NRTP and neighboring pontine nuclei. Small 3 H-leucine injections confined to MT, MST, LIP, area 7 a, or area 7 b, produced multiple patches of pontine terminal label distributed as follows: (1) An injection within MT produced terminal label limited to the dorsolateral and lateral pontine nuclei, (2) Injections restricted to MST or LIP showed patches of terminal label in the dorsal, dorsolateral, lateral, and peduncular pontine nuclei. (3) Area 7 a targets the dorsal, dorsolateral, lateral, peduncular, and ventral pontine nuclei, whereas area 7 b projects, additionally, to the dorsomedial and paramedian pontine nuclei. Notably, no projections were seen to NRTP from any of these cortical areas. In contrast, injections made by other investigators into cortical areas anterior to the central sulcus revealed cerebrocortical afferents to NRTP, in addition to nuclei of the basal pontine gray. With our pontine WGA-HRP injections, retrograde neuronal labeling was observed over a large extent of the frontal cortex continuing onto the medial surface which included {{the lining of the}} cingulate sulcus and cingulate gyrus. Significant subcortical sources for afferents to the NRTP and basal pontine nuclei were the zona incerta, <b>ventral</b> mesencephalic <b>tegmentum,</b> dorsomedial hypothalamic area, rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, red nucleus, and subthalamic nucleus. The combined anterograde and retrograde labeling data indicated that visuo-motor cortico-pontine pathways arising from parietal cortices target only the basal pontine gray, whereas the NRTP, together with select pontine nuclei, is a recipient of afferents from frontal cortical areas. The present findings implicate the existence of parallel direct and indirect cortico-pontine pathways from frontal motor-related cortices to NRTP and neighboring pontine nuclei...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{lines of}} {{evidence}} indicate that neurons within the brainstem pontomesencephalic tegmentum (PMT) are critically {{involved in the}} initiation of paradoxical sleep (PS). Evidence suggests that unidentified but "possibly" cholinergic neurons discharge at higher rates during PS than during slow wave sleep or even Waking and would thus play an active role, whereas "presumed" monoaminergic neurons cease firing during PS and would thus play a permissive role in PS generation. Efferent projections from these PMT neurons have been thought to stimulate PS through modulation of (1) adjacent neurons in the oral pontine reticular formation, (2) more caudally distributed neurons of the medullary reticular formation, and (3) more rostrally distributed neurons in the <b>ventral</b> mesencephalic <b>tegmentum,</b> as well as thalamic and extrathalamic relay systems implicated in limbic and cortical activation. In the present study, dual-immunostaining for c-Fos, as a marker of cellular activation, and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), serotonin (Ser), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), or glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) permitted immunohistochemical identification of active neurons during PS rebound as compared with PS deprivation and PS control conditions. In the PMT, {{there was an increase}} in ChAT+/c-Fos+ cells, a decrease in Ser+/c-Fos+ and TH+/c-Fos+ cells, and an increase in GAD+/c-Fos+ cells during PS rebound. These results support the hypothesis that cholinergic neurons are active, whereas monoaminergic neurons are inactive during PS and possibly inhibited by surrounding GABAergic neurons. In the reticular formation, there was an increase in c-Fos+ cells and a decrease in GAD+/c-Fos+ cells during PS rebound in the oral pontine reticular nucleus, suggesting a disinhibition of these reticular neurons. In contrast, in the caudal pontine and medullary reticular nuclei, there was an increase in GAD+/c-Fos+ cells during PS rebound, and covariation with EMG in a manner to suggest an inhibitory role of these GABAergic neurons in muscle atonia. In the midbrain, there was an increase in TH+/c-Fos+ cells in the ventral tegmental area during PS rebound. The results suggest that DA neurons may increase activity during PS and therein, via connections with limbic and cortical structures, contribute to the unique physiological and cognitive aspects of that state, including dreaming...|$|R
40|$|PMID: 9120053 As {{part of a}} {{research}} program {{to determine if the}} organization of basal ganglia (BG) of amphibians is homologous to that of amniotes, the afferent connections of the BG in the anurans Xenopus laevis and Rana perezi and the urodele Pleurodeles waltl were investigated with sensitive tract-tracing techniques. Hodological evidence is presented that supports a division of the amphibian BG into a nucleus accumbens and a striatum. Both structures have inputs in common from the olfactory bulb, medial pallium, striatopallial transition area, preoptic area, ventral thalamus, ventral hypothalamic nucleus, posterior tubercle, several mesencephalic and rhombencephalic reticular nuclei, locus coeruleus, raphe, and the nucleus of the solitary tract. Several nuclei that project to both subdivisions of the BG, however, show a clear preference for either the striatum (lateral amygdala, parabrachial nucleus) or the nucleus accumbens (medial amygdala, <b>ventral</b> midbrain <b>tegmentum).</b> In addition, the anterior entopeduncular nucleus, central thalamic nucleus, anterior and posteroventral divisions of the lateral thalamic nucleus, and torus semicircularis project exclusively to the striatum, whereas the anterior thalamic nucleus, anteroventral, and anterodorsal tegmental nuclei provide inputs solely to the nucleus accumbens. Apart from this subdivision of the basal forebrain, {{the results of the present}} study have revealed more elaborate patterns of afferent projections to the BG of amphibians than previously thought. Moreover, regional differences within the striatum and the nucleus accumbens were demonstrated, suggesting the existence of functional subdivisions. The present study has revealed that the organization of the afferent connections to the BG in amphibians is basically similar to that of amniotes. According to their afferent connections, the striatum and the nucleus accumbens of amphibians may play a key role in processing olfactory, visual, auditory, lateral line, and visceral information. However, contrary to the situation in amniotes, only a minor involvement of pallial structures on the BG functions is present in amphibians. J. Comp. Neurol. 378 : 16 – 49, 1997.

40|$|The role of {{dopamine}} (DA) in {{the development}} of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was investigated by depleting the dopaminergic innervation of the PFC. A new stereotaxic procedure made it possible to produce small lesions in 1 -day-old rats confined to the A 10 group of dopaminergic cell bodies in the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum,</b> from which the dopaminergic projection to the PFC originates. The variety in the lesions revealed a clear topographical organization of the efferent connections of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the prefrontal cortex. As far as we know from the literature the data presented in this study are a first direct indication of a neurotrophic role for dopamine {{in the development}} of the prefrontal cortex. When the prefrontal cortex was depleted of the dopaminergic innervation from birth on, by lesioning the cells of origin on postnatal day 1, the cortical thickness in the medial PFC was reduced by about 6 %. Although coagulative lesions in the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum</b> cause also a depletion of cortical serotonin, cortical reduction seems to be rather the result of the absence of dopamine during its development.

Cocaine induced focal signal increases in nucleus accumbens/subcallosal cortex (NAc/SCC), caudate, putamen, basal forebrain, thalamus, insula, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, cingulate, lateral prefrontal and temporal cortices, parietal cortex, striate/extrastriate cortices, <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum,</b> and pons and produced signal decreases in amygdala, temporal pole, and medial frontal cortex. Saline produced few {{positive or negative}} activations, which were localized to lateral prefrontal cortex and temporo-occipital cortex. Subjects who underwent repeat studies showed good replication of the regional fMRI activation pattern following cocaine and saline infusions, with activations on saline retest that might reflect expectancy. Brain regions that exhibited early and short duration signal maxima showed a higher correlation with rush ratings. These included the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum,</b> pons, basal forebrain, caudate, cingulate, and most regions of lateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, regions that demonstrated early but sustained signal maxima were more correlated with craving than with rush ratings; such regions included the NAc/SCC, right parahippocampal gyrus, and some regions of lateral prefrontal cortex. Sustained negative signal change was noted in the amygdala, which correlated with craving ratings. Our data demonstrate the ability of fMRI to map dynamic patterns of brain activation following cocaine infusion in cocaine-dependent subjects and provide evidence of dynamically changing brain networks associated with cocaine-induced euphoria and cocaine-induced craving...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} the thesis is {{a study of the}} {{projections}} from low threshold oral and face afferents to the cerebral cortex and of descending motor control mechanisms originating in the cerebral cortex or the hypothalamus and influencing the jaw reflexes. Cats anaesthetized with chi oral ose were used for the experiments. Ipsi- and contralateral nerves from the oral cavity and the face were stimulated electrically. Cortical potentials were averaged and recorded. The location of the projections was related to the cytoarchi-tectonic areas of the cerebral cortex. It was found that the afferents projected to separate maximum points in areas 3 a, 3 b, 5 a and 6 aß. The projections to areas 3 a and 3 b were somatotopically organized, but the layout of the projections on the cortex was not facelike. The effect of monopolar anodal stimulation of the cerebral cortex on the monosynaptic jaw closing and the di synaptic jaw opening reflexes was investigated. A sequence of facilitation and inhibition of both reflexes was elicited by cortical stimulation. The effects were of short latency (2. 5 ms) and could start with either facilitation or inhibition. The timecourse of the sequence was sinuslike with a period of 10 ms. The largest effect originated in the "sensory" areas 3 a and 3 b and not in the "motor" areas 4 y and 6 ag. It is suggested, that a tri gemino-cortico-tri geminai loop via area 3 a may function in reflex modulation of jaw movements. The hypothalamic effects on the jaw reflexes were evoked by electrical stimulation in those parts of the hypothalamus, which are w known to generate defence, attack or feeding responses. A tenfold facilitation of the jaw closing reflex and a facilitation followed by almost complete inhibition of the jaw opening reflex were observed in the anaesthetized animal with intact cerebral cortex. The effects remained but were diminished in amplitude after cortical ablation. The descending path was located in the <b>ventral</b> midbrain <b>tegmentum.</b> It is suggested that the observed hypothalamo-tri geminai mechanism may exercise a tonic influence on the trigeminal motoneurones, thereby controlling the set points of the biting force and the rest position. The implications of this hypothesis on the etiology of bruxism and the myofascial pain-dysfunction are discussed. Härtill 3 rapporter. digitalisering@um...|$|R
40|$|The Hippocampal Formation (HF) has a {{critical}} role in episodic memory. One of the major components in episodic memory is the encoding of novel stimuli, which is associated to dopaminergic system. Lisman and Grace (2005) proposed that novelty signals in the hippocampus modulate the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and that, via a feedback loop, the increase of dopamine in hippocampal neurons promotes the encoding for the novel event. Retrograde tracer studies have demonstrated that the VTA projects directly to the HF in primates (Amaral and Cowan, 1980; Insausti et al., 1987) as well as in rodents. However, whether these projections are reciprocal or not is unknown. Despite this lack of evidence of a direct projection, functional studies indicate that the dopaminergic neurons of the VTA are strongly influenced by the hippocampus indirectly through either lateral septum (Luo et al. 2011) or nucleus accumbens-ventral pallidum pathways (Lisman and Grace 2005). In order to determine the existence of direct inputs from the HF to the VTA and which are the specific fields within the HF responsible of the projection, the retrograde tracers were placed in the mesencephalic <b>ventral</b> and dorsal <b>tegmentum</b> of the Macaca fascicularis monkey, including the VTA.

40|$|The prefrontal cortico-midbrain pathway {{is thought}} to play an {{important}} role in the regulation of the firing pattern in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons. The understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of the midbrain dopamine neurons is critical to elucidate the reward system as well as certain pathological conditions such as drug addiction or schizophrenia. Descending prefrontal cortex (PFC) projections to the VTA have been primarily documented in the rodent brain (Maurice et al., 1999; Sesack and Carr, 2002). Furthermore, several anatomical studies based on the use of anterograde tracers in the nonhuman primate, have shown labeled fibers in the VTA that originated in the medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (areas 25, 32 and 24), orbitofrontal cortex (areas 11 and 14) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (area 9 and 46) (Chiba et al., 2001; Frankle et al., 2006). In order to complete the study of the direct inputs from the PFC to the VTA, the retrograde tracer 3 Fast Blue (FB) was placed in the mesencephalic <b>ventral</b> and dorsal <b>tegmentum</b> in Macaca fascicularis monkey, including the ventral tegmental area. We analyzed three cases injected with FB through a Hamilton syringe in the ventral mesencephalon. A magnetic resonance (MR) examination to localize the stereotaxic coordinates of the injection site was performed in all the animals used in this study. After 2 weeks survival, animals were deeply anesthetized and perfused through the heart with 4 paraformaldehyde. Several additional cases with 3 H-aminoacid injections reported previously (Insausti and Amaral, 2008) were also available for analysis under dark field illumination. Our preliminary results showed labeled neurons in the deep layers of principally, the medial frontal and orbitofrontal cortices, including areas 24, 32 and 25, and the orbitofrontal cortex (areas 11, 13, 12 and 14). Comparatively, the dorsolateral prefrontal (area 10, 9, 46 and 6) cortex displayed far fewer labeled neurons. Most of the labeled neurons were situated at the level of the medial part of caudal area 9 and rostral area 6. The anterograde tracer experiments (5 cases with 3 H-aminoacid deposits placed in the orbitofrontal cortex, and 3 cases in the medial frontal cortex) confirmed the existence of these projections, thus ruling out the contamination by fibers of passage at the retrograde tracer injection sites. Our data suggest that the influence of medial frontal and orbitofrontal cortices on the dopaminergic ascending projections is much higher than from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Induction of immediate-early genes (IEGs), such as c-fos, {{has been}} widely used to mark the {{activation}} of brain regions following different types of sexual stimulation and behavior. A relatively common set of hormone-concentrating basal forebrain and midbrain structures in female and male rodents is activated by copulatory stimulation, in particular, stimulation of sensory nerves that innervate the penis or vagina/cervix, olfactory or pheremonal stimuli, and conditioned sexual incentives. These regions include the preoptic area, lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, paraventricular hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus, medial amygdala, ventral premammillary nuclei, <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum,</b> central tegmental field, mesencephalic central gray, and peripeduncular nuclei. Regions that do not contain classic intracellular steroid receptors, such as the ventral and dorsal striatum or cortex, ar...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a case of}} a 48 -year-old woman who underwent a resection of a tectal pilocytic astrocytoma complicated by a sequence of fluctuating consciousness, psychosis with complex hallucinations and lasting sleeping disturbances in which she vividly acts out her dreams. Based on the clinical and anatomical evidence of this case, we propose the term locus coeruleus syndrome to describe this association of iatrogenic symptoms. Along with those of the locus coeruleus, lesions of the dorsal raphe nucleus, <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum,</b> substantia nigra pars compacta, the superior colliculus and other peduncular lesions (such as peduncular hallucinosis) are involved in the regulation of sleepwake/ arousal, behaviour, sleeping disorders and rapid eye movement atonia. However, iatrogenic lesion of the locus coeruleus could explain the complications on all levels in our patient...|$|E
40|$|A {{group of}} rats {{was trained to}} press levers for {{electrical}} stimulation from bipolar electrodes aimed at the lateral hypothalamus (LH), and another group was trained to self-stimulate from electrodes in the locus coeruleus (LC). All rats in both groups were subjected to unilateral injections of 6 -hydroxydopamine into the substantia nigra and midbrain <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum.</b> The lesions produced profound depletions of dopamine from the ipsilateral frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens/olfactory tubercle, and corpus striatum. Pretreatment with desmethylimipramine prevented loss of noradrenaline in excess of that caused by electrode implantation. The destruction of the dopamine projections produced a persistent and pronounced deficit in intracranial self-stimulation from ipsilateral electrodes in both the LH and LC groups, but only transient effects on self-stimulation from contralateral electrodes at these sites. These results suggest that an intact dopamine system {{is required for the}} expression of self-stimulation behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Morfin is a {{clinically}} used {{analgesic drug}} {{but also an}} abusive drug. It {{has an impact on}} a wide range of CNS regions (nucleus accumbens, <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum,</b> hippocampus, etc.) and affects their functions, e. g. cognitive functions or anxiety. Although the results of so far published studies are often contradictory, the effects on cell death and proliferation in the CNS have been demonstrated. In this work, we focused on how chronic administration of morphine and subsequent withdrawal of this drug affects neurogenesis and neurodegeneration in the rat brain and how it affects some markers involved in the addiction and post-drug-induced condition. We have succeeded in introducing immunohistochemical markers for monitoring neurogenesis (bromodeoxyuridine and doublecortin) and neurodegeneration (Fluoro-Jade C) and for detection of selected neuromodulatory peptides (cholecystokinin and neuropeptide Y). We have found that morphine may influence the process of neurogenesis and neurodegeneration, but its effects differ in different CNS structures (nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and amygdala). Key words: Morphine, brain, rat, withdrawal syndrom, neurogenesis, neurodegeneratio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Bipolar {{disorder}} (BD) {{and major}} depressive disorder (MDD) are heri-table neuropsychiatric disorders associated with disrupted circadian rhythms. The hypothesis that circadian clock dysfunction plays a causal role in these dis-orders has endured for decades but {{has been difficult to}} test and remains contro-versial. In the meantime, the discovery of clock genes and cellular clocks has revolutionized our understanding of circadian timing. Cellular circadian clocks are located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the brain’s primary circadian pacemaker, but also throughout the brain and peripheral tissues. In BD and MDD patients, defects have been found in SCN-dependent rhythms of body temperature and melatonin release. However, these are imperfect and indirect indicators of SCN function. Moreover, the SCN may not be particularly relevant to mood regulation, whereas the lateral habenula, <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum,</b> and hip-pocampus, which also contain cellular clocks, have established roles in this regard. Dysfunction in these non-SCN clocks could contribute directly to the pathophysiology of BD/MDD. We hypothesize that circadian clock dysfunctio...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the active {{ingredient}} of Cannabis, D 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (D 9 -THC), and of the highly addictive drug heroin on in vivo dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens were compared in Sprague-Dawley rats by brain microdialysis. D 9 -THC and heroin increased extracellular dopamine concentrations selectively in the shell of the nucleus accumbens; these effects were mimicked by the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN 55212 - 2. SR 141716 A, an antagonist of central cannabinoid receptors, prevented the effects of D 9 -THC but not those of heroin. Naloxone, a generic opioid antagonist, administered systemically, or naloxonazine, an antagonist of m 1 opioid receptors, infused into the <b>ventral</b> <b>tegmentum,</b> prevented the action of cannabinoids and heroin on dopa-mine transmission. Thus, D 9 -THC and heroin exert similar effects on mesolimbic do-pamine transmission through a common m 1 opioid receptor mechanism located in the ventral mesencephalic tegmentum. Although Cannabis is the most commonly abused illicit substance, its reinforcing properties are difficult to demonstrate i...|$|E
