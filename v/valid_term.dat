Thus, they conclude that although the construct of willingness might be morally unacceptable, it is a scientifically <b>valid</b> <b>term.</b> A similar argument was put forward by Oellerich, who stated that considering all adult/non-adult sexual behavior as abusive and lacking consent can lead to bias in scientific research in the area, and that recognizing this distinction does not necessarily lead to considering adult/non-adult sexual interactions as morally permissible.|$|E

The Compound Term Composition Algebra (CTCA) is an algebra {{with four}} {{algebraic}} operators, {{which can be}} used to generate the <b>valid</b> (meaningful) compound <b>terms</b> of a given faceted taxonomy, in an efficient and flexible manner.

Indeed, the SLDNF-resolution can be used for checking compound term validity and well-formedness of an algebraic expression in polynomial time w. r. t. the size of the expression and the number of terms in the taxonomy. This result makes our logic programming representation a competitive alternative to imperative algorithms.

CHP (Combined Heat & Power) is a vested term referring to thermal power generation with heat recovery. The lack of clear terminology on CHP activities causes confusion and suboptimal regulation, what impairs investment decisions. An improved discourse on CHP is significant in addressing the issues. It starts at the basic definition of CHP itself. A proper definition is instrumental in identifying what the real merit of CHP is, also questioning whether high-quality CHP is a <b>valid</b> <b>term.</b> The proper yardstick of CHP performance is quantities of cogenerated electricity. In extraction-condensing steam turbines, being the most applied thermal power processes, the quantities are not directly observable.

40|$|When {{the nuclear}} genome of an oocyte is {{replaced}} by a somatic cell genome, the resulting hybrid cell can develop into a ‘‘cloned embryo’ ’ that outwardly resembles a fertilized embryo. The somatic pattern of gene expression is not compatible with developmental totipotency, and therefore it needs to be changed through an epigenetic process that has been given the name of nuclear reprogramming. The commonly held view is that the outcome of nuclear reprogramming should result in a pattern of gene expression that approximates that of a fertilized embryo, the only case of developmental totipotency seen in nature. This is seldom the case; therefore (or nevertheless), the task of comparatively assessing cloning results is served by the fertilized embryo, sealing its fate as a control in countless studies to date. But what if an advance in the cloning method enabled a substantial portion of cloned embryos to develop to full term? Would such an advance succeed in copying natural processes, or would it open a new path of developmental totipotency? If the latter, would the fertilized embryo still be a <b>valid</b> <b>term</b> of comparison?
