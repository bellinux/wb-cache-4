2500|$|Munch often uses {{shadows and}} rings of color around his figures to {{emphasize}} {{an aura of}} fear, menace, anxiety, or sexual intensity. These paintings have been interpreted as reflections of the artist's sexual anxieties, though {{it could also be}} argued that they represent his turbulent relationship with love itself and his general pessimism regarding human existence. Many of these sketches and paintings were done in several versions, such as Madonna, Hands and Puberty, and also transcribed as wood-block prints and lithographs. Munch hated to part with his paintings because he thought of his work as a single body of expression. So to capitalize on his production and make some income, he turned to graphic arts to reproduce many of his most famous paintings, including those in this series. Munch admitted to the personal goals of his work but he also offered his art to a wider purpose, [...] "My art is really a <b>voluntary</b> <b>confession</b> and an attempt to explain to myself my relationship with life—it is, therefore, actually a sort of egoism, but I am constantly hoping that through this I can help others achieve clarity." ...|$|E

40|$|In the 2010 case of R. v. Sinclair, the Supreme Court of Canada {{explained}} how the Charter right to counsel applies {{in the context}} of police questioning a detainee. Sinclair constitutes the final instalment in the so-called “interrogation trilogy,” which also includes R. v. Oickle and R. v. Singh. This trilogy of cases, which lays out the legal framework for police interrogation in Canada, has been criticized as providing insufficient safeguards for detainees. Yet, despite the strong reaction from critics, this paper argues that the interrogation trilogy has done little to change Canadian law. The author identifies two main conclusions to be drawn from these cases. First, the Supreme Court has clearly rejected the idea that detainees can cut off interrogation by invoking Charter rights. Second, the <b>voluntary</b> <b>confessions</b> rule has been established as the principal protection for interrogated suspects. The author argues that while the Court’s rejection of questioning cut-off rules was unfortunate, the current system of safeguards centred on the confessions rule may well protect detainees against abuse in the interrogation room better than a system centered on warnings, waivers and questioning cut-off rules...|$|R

40|$|Since the UK Police and Criminal Evidence Act {{introduced}} {{tape recorders}} to police interview rooms in 1984, the insights gained from audio- (and, more recently, video-) recorded police interview data have enabled forensic psychologists to analyse {{the cognitive and}} behavioural processes of interview participants, leading to sweeping {{changes in the way}} that interviewing is taught and practised by British police officers. However, less {{attention has been paid to}} the language of police interviewing and police interviewing methods practised in other parts of the world, such as the Reid Technique, which is ubiquitous in North America. This paper seeks to address both these deficiencies by introducing a linguistic perspective to the analysis of data drawn from an Australian corpus of recorded police interviews.

When evaluating the quality of evidential information obtained in an interview, it is critical to the robustness of the case that the brief is prepared on the basis of volunteered information and not police suggestions.

In addition, the rule outlines a faithful pastoral practice seeking to renew Lutheran congregational life along catholic and confessional lines.

The third part was an unvarying quantity, but {{the first and second}} parts could be varied an infinite number of times. Thus, the pair of lovers could be jarred apart by misunderstood motives, by accident of fate, by jealous rivals, by irate parents, by crafty guardians, by scheming relatives, and so forth and so forth; they could be reunited by a brave deed of the man lover, by a similar deed of the woman lover, by change of heart in one lover or the other, by forced confession of crafty guardian, scheming relative, or jealous rival, by <b>voluntary</b> <b>confession</b> of same, by discovery of some unguessed secret, by lover storming girl's heart, by lover making long and noble self-sacrifice, and so on, endlessly.

5000|$|In the Torah, Reuben is briefly {{described}} as having had sexual activity with Bilhah, his step-mother's maid and father's concubine. On his deathbed, Jacob declares that Reuben [...] "will no longer excel, for you went up onto your father's bed, onto my couch and defiled it." [...] Reuben's behaviour angered Jacob {{to the extent that}} he gave Reuben's birthright (as firstborn) to Joseph: classical rabbinical sources argue that the birthright had included the right of his descendants (the tribe of Reuben) to become ruler over the tribes (transferred to Judah) and priests (transferred to Levi). However, some of these sources argue that Reuben had not actually had sexual activity with Bilhah, but instead had simply supported the cause of his mother Leah, by harming that of Bilhah, angering Jacob; in these sources, it is argued that after the death of Rachel (Jacob's favourite wife), Jacob sought to give the precedence to Bilhah, as he had formerly preferred her mistress, and Reuben removed Bilhah's bed from the place where Jacob wished to have it. The classical rabbinical texts argue that Reuben immediately showed contrition for his actions in regard to Bilhah, and thus was the first penitent; initially, according to these sources, Reuben practiced penitence by secretly meditating, and also by abstaining from meat and wine, but when Judah confessed to the matter of Tamar, Reuben admitted what he had done, lest his other brothers might be suspected of his deed and punished for it. The classical sources go on to state that in honour of this <b>voluntary</b> penance and <b>confession,</b> God gave the tribe of Reuben Hosea as a member, and Reuben was given a reward in the future world.|$|R
50|$|Clark’s {{background}} as a former prosecutor and attorney general also influenced his views {{in the area of}} criminal procedure and cases involving the rights of criminal defendants, often leading him to support the government's prosecutorial efforts, particularly during his early years on the bench. In Crooker v. State of California (1958), for instance, he wrote the Court’s 5-4 opinion upholding a murder conviction {{of a man who was}} repeatedly refused legal counsel and had not been informed of his right to remain silent during fourteen hours between his arrest and confession because, in Clark’s view, the police tactics were reasonable and the <b>confession</b> <b>voluntary.</b> Six years later, however, he joined with his more liberal brethren in the landmark decision Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) upholding the right to a fair trial and due process under the Sixth Amendment and guaranteeing that an individual defendant must have an attorney appointed for him if he could not afford one. Clark dissented in Miranda v. Arizona, the historic ruling in which the Court held that the Constitution ensures a “right to remain silent,” but he later clarified that he did not disagree with the underlying idea of limits on custodial interrogation. Clark also authored the Court’s landmark decision in Mapp v. Ohio, which broadened the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on the prosecution’s use of improperly seized evidence, known as the exclusionary rule, to include state prosecutions. Clark's law enforcement background actually led him to support this approach, because he believed that having a states attorney and a federal prosecutor operating under the same system would ensure that police would be more disciplined and that it would actually lower the risk of evidence being disallowed. Clark demonstrated this progressive understanding right up through his final day on the bench, writing Berger v. New York (1967), an important Fourth Amendment decision in which the Court held unconstitutional a state statute allowing electronic eavesdropping. It was a holding that was quite distant from policies he had imposed as attorney general.|$|R

Travellers of late have told us enough--and too much for our comfort of mind--of that prevailing dread of poison as well as of magic which urges the African Negroes to deeds of horrible cruelty; and the fact that these African Negroes, up to the very latest importations, are the special practisers of Obeah, is notorious through the West Indies. The existence of this trick of poisoning is denied, often enough. Sometimes Europeans, willing to believe the best of their fellow-men--and who shall blame them?-- simply disbelieve it because it is unpleasant to believe.
