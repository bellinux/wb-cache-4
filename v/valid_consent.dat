500|$|In Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, the United States Supreme Court {{established}} {{a framework for}} determining whether a suspect's consent is voluntary. The Court noted that historically, when [...] "determining whether a defendant's will was overborne in a particular case, the Court has assessed the totality of all the surrounding circumstances—both {{the characteristics of the}} accused and the details of the interrogation". Consequently, the Court held that voluntariness should be determined [...] "from the totality of all the circumstances". The Court also clarified that judges should examine the [...] "possibly vulnerable subjective state of the person who consents" [...] to determine whether a suspect was coerced into consenting, and [...] "account must be taken of subtly coercive police questions". However, the Court also held that suspects may still give <b>valid</b> <b>consent</b> even if they do not know that they can refuse to consent to the search.|$|E

40|$|M. Sc. (Med.) (Bioethics and Health Law)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Health Sciences, 2012. A <b>valid</b> Informed <b>consent</b> (IC) is the {{cornerstone}} of good research ethics practice from clinical trials to social science research. My research report will explore the idea of IC from its first known beginnings to its many facets as now recognised in the literature. One of my focuses is on the Nuremberg Code which I consider to still carry the fundamental ethical ideals concerning research involving human participants. As I identify the many obstacles to achieving a <b>valid</b> informed <b>consent,</b> it will be clear that {{in the context of a}} developing or ‘low income’ country, that a <b>valid</b> informed <b>consent</b> should be taken very seriously as it involves much more than just a research participant putting his or her signature on a piece of paper. In research, particularly in clinical trials where the scientific or clinical impact is potentially very great and in which much money has been invested, researchers should be aware that often their participants hold different views of what participation involves. For example, some may view participation in a clinical trial as a means of obtaining medical treatment they would otherwise not receive. One of the many barriers to realizing a <b>valid</b> informed <b>consent</b> that I consider is the problem of the increasing length of informed consent forms. This, I will suggest represents a shift from the ethical ideal of protecting human participants in research. Rather, it seems to represent as a protection from possible liability on the part of the industry-sponsor. In my research report, I also identify particular South African legislation and research ethics guidelines which should guide good research practice in South Africa. I point out that there are many laws, research ethics guidelines and regulations that have been implemented due to the atrocities of the past (and present) regarding using people in experimentation and the gross human right violations that accompanied these. Yet, in spite of these, I identify the many barriers that are present in obtaining a <b>valid</b> informed <b>consent</b> as well as the recognition that it is a process. A <b>valid</b> informed <b>consent</b> has at its ethical grounding respect for the dignity and worth of every human being. This research report hopes to add to the discussion concerning the importance of a <b>valid</b> informed <b>consent</b> in research involving human participants...|$|R

2500|$|Until 2012, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{considered}} rape a crime solely {{committed by}} men against women. In 2012, {{they changed their}} definition from [...] "The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will" [...] to [...] "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, {{without the consent of}} the victim." [...] The previous definition, which had remained unchanged since 1927, was considered outdated and narrow. The updated definition includes recognizing any gender of victim and perpetrator and that rape with an object can be as traumatic as penile/vaginal rape. The bureau further describes instances when the victim is unable to give consent because of mental or physical incapacity. It recognizes that a victim can be incapacitated by drugs and alcohol and unable to give <b>valid</b> <b>consent.</b> The definition does not change federal or state criminal codes or impact charging and prosecution on the federal, state or local level; it rather means that rape will be more accurately reported nationwide.|$|E
2500|$|The Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) {{believes}} that mental disability {{is not a}} reason to deny sterilization. [...] The opinion of ACOG is that [...] "the physician must consult with the patient’s family, agents, and other caregivers" [...] if sterilization is desired for a mentally limited patient. [...] In 2003, Douglas Diekema wrote in Volume 9 of the journal Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews that [...] "involuntary sterilization ought not be performed on mentally retarded persons who retain the capacity for reproductive decision-making, the ability to raise a child, or the capacity to provide <b>valid</b> <b>consent</b> to marriage." [...] The Journal of Medical Ethics claimed, in a 1999 article, that doctors are regularly confronted with request to sterilize mentally limited people who cannot give consent for themselves. The article recommend that sterilization should only occur {{when there is a}} [...] "situation of necessity" [...] and the [...] "benefits of sterilization outweigh the drawbacks." [...] The American Journal of Bioethics published an article, in 2010, that concluded the interventions used in the Ashley treatment may benefit future patients. [...] These interventions, {{at the request of the}} parents and guidance from the physicians, included a hysterectomy and surgical removal of the breast buds of the mentally and physically disabled child.|$|E

40|$|Informed consent {{refers to}} the process of giving information, {{discussing}} and obtaining permission of patients or participants in terms of medical treatment and human research. Informed consent is the most important right for the patient. However making standardization of <b>valid</b> informed <b>consent</b> is likely to be difficult due to a number of obstacles. On the other hand, courts may require <b>valid</b> informed <b>consent</b> to hold litigation. For this reason, this paper intends to discuss the difficulties in obtaining <b>valid</b> informed <b>consent</b> which is divided into five main elements: disclosure of information, understanding, voluntariness, competence, and consent. This paper will focus on particular situations: emergency cases, critically ill, psychiatric patients, child patients, and human research. This literature review is developed from examining in depth some references such as journal and text book. Chosen references reviewed are study of informed consent particularly in emergency cases, critically ill, psychiatric patients, child patients and human research. The main theory is from Beauchamp, the author of Principle Bioethics. After reviewing this literature it is found that, employing the four aspects of informed consent is likely to be complicated. This may be caused by the condition of patients and participants. People have to deal with some ambiguities of the four aspects of informed consent. There is likely to be conflict between promoting autonomy and the principle of beneficence. Furthermore, the <b>valid</b> informed <b>consent</b> may not be obtained. Therefore, courts have to consider informed consent as a part of legal doctrine for those circumstances. Nonetheless, physicians and researchers have {{to be aware of the}} importance of informed consent to grant patients and participants??? autonomy and to respect human rights.

40|$|As {{the number}} of human {{participants}} in clinical trials continues to grow, it is increasingly imperative that research nurses are educated about <b>valid</b> research informed <b>consent</b> to improve patient outcomes.

The research nurse must also be aware of their available resources and who to contact if they suspect a problem or a lack of patient comprehension of the study. In order to address these needs, an evidence-based performance improvement project was created as part of a Clinical Nurse Leader Internship on the Clinical Research Unit of an urban teaching hospital. This unit did not have any formal training on research informed consent for their nursing staff.
