The populations of this research are all companies under Advertising Printing Media stocks listed on IDX. The results of this research are: (1) Based on the statistical test of the average abnormal return of stocks during the event period, it was found that {{there was no significant difference}} in the average of abnormal return before and after the presidential election year 2014. It is due to the type of capital market of Indonesia that is semi-strong type of capital market, therefore the information or events that happened in Indonesia did not respond quickly by Indonesian investors. (2) Based on the statistical test of the average trading volume of stocks during the event period, it was found that there was no significant difference in the average of trading volume before and after the presidential election year 2014. The absence of significant differences in the average of trading <b>volume</b> <b>activities</b> before and after the presidential election was because of no demand from investors to trade their stocks, this means investors assumed the presidential election year 2014 was not a big event that affects the desire of investors to trade their stocks in market.
