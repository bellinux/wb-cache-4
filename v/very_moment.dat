5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} sole {{survivor of the}} flight, a Czech officer, Eduard Prchal. Prchal, like many pilots who {{did not wish to}} tempt fate was known for never wearing his Mae West life jacket — but on this occasion, when rescued from the sea, he was wearing one. During the inquiry he denied this, and later blamed the inconsistency on post-crash shock affecting his actions and memory – essentially, on amnesia. Later he explained that he must have instinctively put the vest on when he realised the plane was in trouble. Polish aviation expert Jerzy Maryniak created a simulation of the crash, in which he concluded that the plane must have been under control up until the <b>very</b> <b>moment</b> of the crash. Kisielewski argues that the plane was likely {{under the control of the}} second pilot, who died in the crash.|$|E
5|$|Between 11 March (Commonwealth Day) and 10 August 2002, {{as part of}} the {{preparations}} for the upcoming Commonwealth Games and to celebrate Her Majesty the Queen's Golden Jubilee, a national Spirit of Friendship Festival was organised. On 9 July, {{a few weeks before the}} Games began, a sculpture outside the new national headquarters of the English Institute of Sport at SportCity was unveiled by the middle-distance runner, Steve Cram MBE. This sculpture, commissioned in late 2001, was created in a little over eight weeks by Altrincham-based artist, Colin Spofforth, who had submitted to Manchester City Council his idea for a heroic-sized sculpture of a sprinter as a means of celebrating the beauty, power and determination of the competing athletes. Reaching thirty feet high, weighing seven tonnes, and titled The Runner, this unique larger-than-life bronze statue of a male sprinter surmounting a bronze globe was, at the time, the United Kingdom's largest sporting sculpture. It depicts the <b>very</b> <b>moment</b> the runner leaves the blocks once the starter's gun has fired.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of Lebanon's Identity Card is {{the main}} form of {{identification}} on {{the territory of the}} Republic of Lebanon. All Lebanese are obliged by law to carry their identity cards with them at all times and are subject to fines should they not. According to the Lebanese obligation of identification, it is compulsory for all Lebanese citizens habitually resident in the Republic of Lebanon, aged 15 or older, to possess either an identity card or a passport noting that the earlier offers no benefits compared to the passport with the exception of being easier to carry in a wallet or a handbag. It enables bearers to log into certain services on the Internet, local computers or add a digital signatures into LibreOffice ODF documents or create DigiDoc formatted containers that also allows encryption during content transfer. While police officers and some other officials have a right to demand to see one of these documents, the law does not state that one is obliged to submit the document at that <b>very</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
40|$|Using a {{procedure}} that borrowed from both a quantitative and a qualitative research approach to psychotherapy, this study investigated audiotaped recordings of six sessions of Gestalt therapy conducted by five distinguished therapists. This in-depth, discovery-oriented research explored the interrelations between in-session client conditions, therapist operations and <b>very</b> good <b>moments.</b> In {{the first phase of}} the study, composite descriptions of six categories of <b>very</b> good <b>moments</b> were generated, based on the identification and the subsequent descriptions of 17 instances of <b>very</b> good <b>moments</b> made by a team of twelve judges. The six categories of <b>very</b> good <b>moments</b> were: From Neutral to Strong Feeling; Strong Expression Directly Toward Therapist; Extratherapy Behavior Change Intention; Acceptance of Problem-Self; State of General Well-Being; and New, Deeply Felt Personality Process-State. In the second phase of the investigation, judges identified explicit therapist operations and methods which, when carried out under identified client conditions or states, were judged as being instrumental in the subsequent occurrence of the given category of <b>very</b> good <b>moments.</b> The main finding was as follows: (a) The skilled and competent use of specific therapist operations, (b) with a client who is ready and willing to use the operations, and to move toward that <b>very</b> good <b>moment,</b> (c) appeared to result in the occurrence of that <b>very</b> good <b>moment.</b> For practitioners who value these categories of <b>very</b> good <b>moments,</b> the findings may be used as provisional suggestions for ways of facilitating the occurrence of these <b>very</b> good <b>moments.</b> For researchers, the findings are illustrative of continuing explorations into how psychotherapy works, into the relations between in-session client conditions or states, therapist operations, and consequent in-session <b>very</b> good <b>moments.</b> By means of careful, in-depth examination, researchers can learn what practitioners do to help bring about important and useful in-session client events...|$|R

At the nuclear power plant, the alien kills another person, but Mulder and Scully are denied access by Spender and Fowley. Upon returning to their car they find Gibson inside, who has escaped from The Smoking Man. Later that night, Fowley tells Mulder she was offered the X-Files and is protecting his interest. Mulder leaves Gibson with Scully and heads off with her. Mulder and Fowley believe the alien is seeking heat, {{which is why it}} is in the nuclear power plant. Inside they find organic material on the ground and cooling pipes.|$|E
5|$|The film's prologue {{shows the}} {{preparations}} {{for a hot}} air balloon ride. The balloon is tethered to the spire of a church next to a river, with a man named Yefim (Nikolay Glazkov) attempting to make the flight by use of a harness roped beneath the balloon. At the <b>very</b> <b>moment</b> of his attempt an ignorant mob arrive from the river and attempt to thwart the flight, putting a firebrand {{into the face of}} one of the men on the ground assisting Yefim. In spite of this the balloon is successfully released and Yefim is overwhelmed and delighted by the view from above and the sensation of flying, but he can not prevent a crash landing shortly after. He is the first of several creative characters, representing the daring escapist, whose hopes are easily crushed. After the crash, a horse is seen rolling on its back by a pond, a symbol of life–one of many horses in the movie.|$|E

25|$|Theologically, {{one major}} {{controversy}} {{of the age}} was the Immaculate Conception. Anthony of Padua (1195–1231) supported Mary's freedom from sin and her Immaculate Conception. His many sermons on the Virgin Mary shaped the Mariological approach {{of a large number}} of Franciscans who followed his approach for centuries after his death. Gradually the idea that Mary had been cleansed of original sin at the <b>very</b> <b>moment</b> of her conception began to predominate, particularly after Duns Scotus dealt with the major objection to Mary's sinlessness from conception, that being her need for redemption. The very divine act, in making Mary sinless at the first instant of her conception was, he argued, the most perfect form of redemption possible.|$|E
