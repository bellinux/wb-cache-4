When the patient was cured or had died, the notes of the physician were examined by a local medical council of other physicians, who would review the practising physician's notes to decide whether his/her performance have met the required standards of medical care. If their reviews were negative, the practicing physician could face a lawsuit from a maltreated patient.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason for}} Japan’s growing aging {{population}} {{is because of}} high life expectancy; Japan's life expectancy in 2016 was 85 years, {{similar to that of}} Singapore, and lower only than that of Monaco. The life expectancy is 81.7 for males and 88.5 for females. Since Japan’s overall population is shrinking due to low fertility rates, the aging population is rapidly increasing. Factors such as improved nutrition, advanced medical and pharmacological technologies reduced the prevalence of diseases, improving living conditions. Also peace and prosperity post-World War II contributed to economic growth, leading to long life.

2500|$|The novel opens by a {{conversation}} between two eminent physicians in an insane asylum. A beautiful woman had {{attracted the attention of}} the <b>visiting</b> <b>physician.</b> The strange story of her life is given in succeeding chapters, carrying the reader from story to philosophy, from pure description to metaphysical speculation without any break in continuity of thought. The story is not startling, and it has few strong dramatic passages. By stages, the reader is carried from the world of the physical into the realm of dreams. At one moment, he is with Mr. and Mrs. Varien; the next, he finds himself peering into the beyond, gazing through the entranced vision of Mrs. Varien on the daily life of the little child which died when only three years old. The life story of Mrs. Varien is set as an odd tale. During the day, she is the same as other people, while at night, for 15 years, she is entranced, and her soul dwells with her child. In this other world, many life mysteries are explained. Many passages, especially the utterances of the mystic master, resemble prose poems. The chapters which aid in forming a conception of the character of the work include: “Doctors Agree,” “She Dreamed a Dream,” “The Dream World,” “The Beginning of the End,” “Science Fails,” “The Watch,” “The Voice of the Master,” “A Star Was Shining,” “A Strange Quest,” “The Gates Are Passed,” “A Successful Experiment,” “Such is the Law,” “Whom God Hath Joined,” “For all Eternity,” “An Innumerable Company.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{congregation}} Philip Neri founded is of {{an original}} stamp, [...] little [...] resembling a monastery of the older type, and its rules (not drawn up [...] by Philip Neri, but approved by Pope Paul V in 1612) [...] leave considerable freedom of action compared with traditional religious foundations. The Oratory admits only priests aged at least 36, or seminarians who have completed their studies and are ready for ordination, and its members are supported by lay brothers. The members live in community, and each pays his own expenses, having the usufruct of his private means—a considerable innovation compared with the monastic vow of poverty. The members have indeed a common table, but the expenses are met by monthly payments from each. Nothing {{is provided by the}} society except the bare lodging, and the fees of a <b>visiting</b> <b>physician.</b> Everything else, including clothing, books, furniture, medicines, must be paid for by the individual. There are no vows, and every member of the society is at liberty to withdraw when he pleases, and to take his property with him. The government is unlike the Jesuit model, and the superior, though first in honour, [...] takes his turn in discharging all the duties which come to each priest of the society in the order of his seniority, including that of waiting at table. Four deputies assist the superior in the government, and all public acts are decided by a majority of votes of the whole congregation, in which the superior has no casting vote. To be elected as superior a priest has to have been a member for 15 years and like all offices, is for a term of 3 years. The individual has an active voice only after three years membership and a [...] deliberative voice only after ten years.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} social factors on medical care service use of African and white adults. The research question stems from an intriguing set of finding from health services research: African Americans have more health problems and are more frequently hospitalized, yet they <b>visit</b> <b>physicians</b> less often. ^ By applying two theoretical frameworks in sociology, this study compares African and white Americans {{to gain a better}} conceptualization of ethnicity as a variable in studying health and medical care services use. ^ The data are two-wave (1986 and 1989) longitudinal data from Americans 2 ̆ 7 Changing Lives, with 3497 African and white subjects. The analytical strategies include t-tests and logistic and multiple regression. Besides separate sample analyses, significant differences between the magnitudes of the regression coefficients in different samples were tested by creating interaction terms between race and independent factors. ^ Effects of independent factors at baseline on three dependent factors (self-rated health, <b>physician</b> <b>visits,</b> and hospitalization) are assessed. Separate sample analyses show that self-rated health is a significant predictor of <b>physician</b> <b>visits</b> for white Americans while chronic conditions and functional health are significant predictors for African Americans. Health insurance does not predict <b>physician</b> <b>visits</b> for the African American sample while it does predict use in the white sample. ^ African Americans with more chronic conditions and with worse functional health {{are more likely to have}} <b>visited</b> a <b>physician.</b> African Americans who drink more and who <b>visited</b> <b>physicians</b> more often at the baseline have reported more <b>physician</b> <b>visits</b> at the follow-up. Also, African Americans who seek religious comfort are more likely to have been hospitalized for a longer period of time. African Americans who get transportation help at baseline are more likely to have been hospitalized and for longer periods of time. ^ Longitudinal data with two or more waves are necessary in order to assess and compare rates of change in health and use of service. Also, it is desirable to measure social support derived from religious involvement in order to achieve a better understanding in social support and religious involvement. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background We {{used the}} {{insurance}} claims of a representative cohort {{to quantify the}} patterns of ambulatory care visits, especially the doctor-shopping phenomenon, in Taiwan. Methods The ambulatory visit files of the 200, 000 -person cohort datasets from the National Health Insurance Research Database in 2002 were analyzed. Only a <b>visit</b> with <b>physician</b> consultation would be considered. We computed the visit patterns both by visit count and by patient count. Results In 2002, there were 182, 474 eligible people with 2, 443, 003 physician consultations. During the year, 87. 4 % of the cohort had <b>visited</b> <b>physician</b> clinics and 57. 5 % had visited hospital-based outpatient or emergency departments. On average, a person had 13. 4 physician consultations and consulted 3. 4 specialties, 5. 2 physicians, and 3. 9 healthcare facilities in a year. In 2002, 17. 3 % of the cohort had ever visited different healthcare facilities on the same day; 23. 5 % had ever <b>visited</b> <b>physicians</b> of the same specialty at different healthcare facilities within 7 days {{and the percentage of}} second visits was 3. 8 % of all visits. Besides, 7. 6 % of the cohort had visited two or more specialties at the same facility on the same day, and such visits make up 2. 5 % of all visits. Conclusion The people in Taiwan did <b>visit</b> the <b>physicians</b> and outpatient departments frequently. Many patients not only consulted several physicians of different specialties and at different healthcare facilities during the year, but also switched the physicians and facilities quickly. An effective referral system with efficient data exchange between facilities might be the solution. </p...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionMany Medicare enrollees do {{not receive}} {{colorectal}} cancer tests at recommended intervals despite having Medicare screening coverage. Little {{is known about the}} <b>physician</b> <b>visits</b> of Medicare enrollees who are untested. Our study objective was to evaluate <b>physician</b> <b>visits</b> of enrollees who lack appropriate testing to identify opportunities to increase colorectal cancer testing. MethodsWe used North Carolina and South Carolina Medicare data to compare type and frequency of <b>physician</b> <b>visits</b> for Medicare enrollees with and without a colorectal cancer test in 2005. Type of <b>physician</b> <b>visit</b> was defined by the physician specialty as primary care, mixed specialty (more than 1 specialty, 1 of which was primary care), and nonprimary care. We used multivariate modeling to assess the influence of type and frequency of <b>physician</b> <b>visits</b> on colorectal cancer testing. ResultsApproximately half (46. 5 %) of enrollees lacked appropriate colorectal cancer testing. Among the untested group, 19. 8 % had no <b>physician</b> <b>visits</b> in 2005. Enrollees with primary care visits {{were more likely to be}} tested than those without a primary care visit. Many enrollees who had primary care visits remained untested. Enrollees with <b>visits</b> to all <b>physician</b> types had a greater likelihood of having colorectal cancer testing. ConclusionsWe identified 3 categories of Medicare enrollees without appropriate colorectal cancer testing: those with no visits, those who see primary care physicians only, and those with multiple <b>visits</b> to <b>physicians</b> with primary and nonprimary care specialties. Different strategies are needed for each category to increase colorectal cancer testing in the Medicare population...|$|R
