40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the effect of wood species and the number of layers of veneer against laminated veneer properties. Wood species consist of sengon, pine, and mixed pine sengon. Laminated <b>veener</b> made by a number of layers consist of 4, 6, and 8 layers. The difference of a number of layers was to identify quality of laminated veneer. The adhesive used is urea formaldehyde (UF) liquid. The results showed that the average moisture content of 10. 76 %, density of 0. 54 g/cm 3, delamination 5. 8 %, MOE 124. 108 kg/cm 2, and MOR 450. 74 kg/cm 2. The moisture content and delamination made all meet the Indonesian National Standard. Statistically, wood species were a significant effect on moisture content, density, MOE, and MOR, while various of layers were a significant effect on moisture content, density, delamination, MOE, and MOR.
