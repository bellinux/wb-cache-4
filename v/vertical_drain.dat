40|$|This paper {{presents}} a finite element procedure {{for the analysis}} of consolidation of layered soils with <b>vertical</b> <b>drain</b> using general one-dimensional (1 -D) constitutive models. In formulating the finite element procedure, a Newton-Cotes-type integration formula is used to avoid the unsymmetry of the stiffness matrix for a Newton (Modified Newton) iteration scheme. The proposed procedure is then applied for the consolidation analysis of a number of typical problems using both linear and non-linear soil models. Results from this simplified method are compared with those from a fully coupled consolidation analysis using a well-known finite element package. The average degree of consolidation, excess porewater pressure and average vertical effective stress are almost the same as those from the fully coupled analysis for both the linear and non-linear cases studied. The differences in vertical effective stresses are tolerable except for the values near the <b>vertical</b> <b>drain</b> boundaries. The consolidation behaviour of soils below a certain depth of the bottom of <b>vertical</b> <b>drain</b> is actually one-dimensional for the partially penetrating case. Therefore, there are not much differences in whether one uses a one-dimensional model or a three-dimensional model in this region. The average degree of consolidation has good normalized feature with respect to the ratio of well radius to external drainage boundary for the cases of fully penetrating <b>vertical</b> <b>drain</b> using a normalized time even in the non-linear case. Numerical results clearly demonstrate that the proposed simplified finite element procedure is efficient for the consolidation analysis of soils with <b>vertical</b> <b>drain</b> and it has better numerical stability characteristics. This simplified method can easily account for layered systems, time-dependent loading, well-resistance, smear effects and inelastic stress-strain behaviour. This method is also very suitable for the design of <b>vertical</b> <b>drain,</b> since it greatly reduces the unknown variables in the calculation and the 1 -D soil model parameters can be more easily determined.

40|$|In Malaysia, {{soft soil}} {{deposits}} ar e widespread {{all over the}} country and mostly found in the coastal area. In general, soft soil posses low strength and high compressibil ity and thus having low bearing capacity. The soil needs to be improved to avoid excessive settlement and prevent stability failure that affecting the safety of the infrastructure. Preloading is one of the mo st effective and economical methods to reduce settlement and improve the bearing capacity of the soft soil. The application of preloading does help in applying stress to the existing soil, thus increasing the pore water pressure. Consolidation happens when the wate r in soil is squeezed out from the soil matrix. With the elimination of water from the soil, the soil strength is increased. However, this method does not have the advantages of speeding up the process of pore water pressure dissipation hence settlement might takes years to complete. The preloading method is usually co mbined with <b>vertical</b> <b>drain.</b> The use of prefabricated <b>vertical</b> <b>drain</b> in a soft soil layer can shorten the treatment time of ground by increasing the rate of consolidation. The consolidation time depends on the travelling distance of the water to flow out from the soil matrix. The installation of <b>vertical</b> <b>drain</b> shor tens the drainage path by allowing the water to flow horizontally towards the drain, and drain out to the soil surface through the <b>vertical</b> <b>drain.</b> Generally, the installation of vertic al drain is carried out in an extensive area. The behavior of ve rtical drain can be expressed as axisymmetric unit cell. There are studies carried out by researchers on <b>vertical</b> <b>drain</b> using linear model, e. g. embankment on soft Bangkok clay (Bergado 1993).

40|$|Various {{analytical}} {{theories of}} consolidation for soils with vertical drains {{have been proposed}} in the past. Most conventional theories {{are based on a}} cylindrical unit cell that contains only a single <b>vertical</b> <b>drain.</b> This paper described a new analytical model where a <b>vertical</b> <b>drain</b> located at the centre (the 2 ̆ 7 inner <b>vertical</b> <b>drain</b> 2 ̆ 7) and is surrounded by two or three vertical drains (the 2 ̆ 7 outer vertical drains 2 ̆ 7), the number of which depends on whether the configuration is triangular or rectangular. Both types of drains are combined into a cylindrical unit cell, and the water is assumed to flow both inwards to the inner <b>vertical</b> <b>drain</b> and outwards to the outer vertical drains distributed around the circumference. The outer radial boundary of the unit cell is regarded as a permeable boundary, with a drainage capacity of two or three separate vertical drains for triangular and rectangular configurations, respectively. The smear effects and the drainage resistances for both the inner and outer vertical drains are considered in the analysis as well. In this way, the equations governing the consolidation process with multiple vertical drains are derived, and the corresponding analytical solutions are obtained for instantaneously loading, ramp loading and multi-stage of instantaneously loading and multi-stage of ramp loading. The present solutions are finally compared with several conventional solutions for a single <b>vertical</b> <b>drain</b> in the literature. The results show that the present model predicts the same average degree of consolidation as conventional models do, which verifies the correctness of this new model.

40|$|This master thesis {{focus on}} {{predicting}} settlement with preloading {{with and without}} <b>vertical</b> <b>drains</b> with respect to time by using finite element method with PLAXIS 2 D. Constructions on soft deposits with high load in term of storing materials are often causing stability and settlements problems because these soft deposits have high compressibility and low shear strength. Preloading {{is one of the}} most economical method to stabilize the soft soil and to ensure it does not cause any problem that can pose a danger. Due to preloading the deformation within soil like clay increases because the preloading produces excess pore pressures within the soil which cause the water in the soil to flow toward the surface, until an equilibrium state of stress is reached where excess pore pressures become zero. To estimate and predict the settlements under stacks of stored sawdust at Bio Energy Luleå, we have made analyses with and without <b>vertical</b> <b>drains</b> on PLAXIS 2 D. Model layers have been defined with the help of geotechnical investigation. <b>Vertical</b> <b>drains</b> have been used to accelerate the rate of consolidation. The model has been analyzed with preloading to reduce the post-construction settlements under the future load due to the stored sawdust. The preloading has been used with the help of sand embankment on the ground. The results of analyzed the model with PLAXIS 2 D program showed that the excess pore water pressures were significantly higher and dissipated slowly for the case without <b>vertical</b> <b>drains</b> compare to the case with <b>vertical</b> <b>drains.</b> The reason is that <b>vertical</b> <b>drains</b> effectively decrease the excess pore pressure and help to accelerate its dissipation during the consolidation period. Also, the rate of settlement during the consolidation with <b>vertical</b> <b>drains</b> is higher than without <b>vertical</b> <b>drains</b> which has been used in the impermeable soil layers due to the low hydraulic conductivity. In both cases with and without <b>vertical</b> <b>drains</b> with preloading, the vertical deformation at the center of an embankment has been observed to be 24 cm and 26 cm respectively and the total deformation is 39 cm and 37 cm. These values are close to the field measurements. The overall duration has been reduced around two months with <b>vertical</b> <b>drains</b> because of increased rate of consolidation and the dissipation of excess pore water pressures with applied external load. The results from the PLAXIS 2 D program shows to be fairly realistic with compare to the field measurements. On the basis of analysis, it can be concluded that preloading without <b>vertical</b> <b>drains</b> will be an economical method to prevent the post-construction settlements at Bio Energy Luleå.

Well resistance, smear effect, vacuum loss, large lateral deformation and variation of soil stiffness and permeability are considered. Centrifuge tests of clay {{with a single}} vertical sand drain and a vertical sand drain group at a spacing of 8 D (D is drain diameter) were carried out.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Many {{different}} formulations for converting a prefabricated <b>vertical</b> <b>drain</b> with {{a rectangular}} cross section to an equivalent diameter {{well have been}} developed. In addi-tion to equivalent diameter, engineers must also consider the impact of smear when design-ing a system that utilizes prefabricated vertical drains. An experiment and mathematical modeling were used to study the validity of using a reduced equivalent diameter to account for smear. Mathematical modeling of the fourmost commonly used equivalent diameter for-mulations yielded nearly the same equipotentials. In addition, the equipotentials calculated for the equivalent diameter wells differed substantially from a prefabricated <b>vertical</b> <b>drain</b> modeled with and without smear. This indicates that equipotentials are not the best means to evaluate equivalent diameter formulations because the change in shape from a rectangle to a circle impacts the head values {{to such a degree}} that the equipotentials will never be simi...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the consolidation of}} a layer of clay in which partially penetrating prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) are {{used in conjunction with}} a combined surcharge and vacuum preloading. Analytical solutions for partially penetrating PVDs are derived by considering vacuum pressure (suction), time-dependent embankment surcharge, well resistance, and smear zone. Three-dimensional seepage with a virtual <b>vertical</b> <b>drain</b> is assumed to reflect real seepage into the soil beneath the tip of a PVD. Analytical solutions were then used to examine the length of the <b>vertical</b> <b>drain</b> and vacuum pressure on soft clay to determine the consolidation time and degree of consolidation, associated settlement, and distribution of suction along the drain. The proposed solutions are then employed to analyse a case history. Finally, an appropriate PVD length in relation to clay thickness and drain spacing is recommended for various loading patterns...|$|E
40|$|Prefabricated <b>Vertical</b> <b>Drain</b> {{incorporated}} with preloading {{has been}} used widely as a ground improvement technique in Geotechnical Engineering. The application of Prefabricated <b>Vertical</b> <b>Drain</b> and Preloading {{has proven to be}} one of the cheapest methods in ground improvement technique. In this paper, the latter was used for a New Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 ground improvement. The new Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 is being constructed on the very soft clay. Due to the nature of the ground, the improvement works by surcharge preloading and prefabricated vertical drains (PVD) was being implemented. This paper will report the case history of ground improvement works base from observation of settlement magnitude using the above technique. Comparison between theoretical calculation and instrumentation observation will be deployed. It was expected that the different in reading is inevitable due to certain constraint in applying the soil parameters obtained from the ground investigation...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} recent {{developments}} in soft soil improvement through consolidation is presented in this paper. The salient aspects described here range from fundamental analysis to methods of implementation. The methods and processes covered here include vertical drains; vacuum preloading or combined vacuum and fill surcharge; and dynamic consolidation with enhanced drainage or vacuum. Discussions on methods to evaluate the degree of consolidation using field data are also made, including various limitations and comparison between the processes where warranted. New types of prefabricated <b>vertical</b> <b>drains</b> (PVD) and new applications such as thermal or electric PVDs are also introduced.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the analytical modeling of <b>vertical</b> <b>drains</b> incorporating vacuum preloading in both axisymmetric and plane strain conditions. The effectiveness of vacuum pressure (i. e. both constant vacuum pressure and varied vacuum pressure) applied along the drain is considered. A multidrain plane strain model is employed to analyse an embankment {{at the site}} of Second Bangkok International Airport (SBIA) stabilised with prefabricated <b>vertical</b> <b>drains.</b> At this site, a significantly reduced height of sand surcharge was applied by reducing the pore pressures through vacuum preloading. The results of FEM analysis confirm the efficiency of vacuum preloading in comparison with the conventional method of surcharge alone...|$|R
40|$|Application of vacuum {{assisted}} preloading is an imperative method when {{a considerable}} load {{is required to}} meet the desired rate of settlement {{and an increase in}} the undrained shear strength upon consolidation. Moreover, where lateral displacements {{at the edge of a}} coastal embankment need to be controlled, application of vacuum pressure with a cut off offers the optimum solution. To facilitate vacuum propagation, <b>vertical</b> <b>drains</b> are usually employed in conjunction. The installation of <b>vertical</b> <b>drains</b> using a steel mandrel creates significant remoulding of the subsoil surrounding the drains thereby, reducing soil permeability and adversely affecting the soil consolidation process. In this paper, the simulation of vacuum assisted consolidation using the spectral method and finite element analysis is carried out. Subsequently, the 2 D and 3 D numerical multi-drain analyses are conducted to predict the excess pore pressures, lateral and vertical displacements. The performance of two selected case histories at the sites of Suvarnabhumi Airport, Thailand and Tianjin Port, China are discussed and analysed. The numerical predictions are then compared with the available field data. Finally, a procedure for the design of <b>vertical</b> <b>drains</b> is presente...|$|R
