25|$|Typically, the IF center {{frequency}} fIF is {{chosen to be}} less than the desired reception frequency fRF. The choice has some performance advantages. First, it is easier and less expensive to get high selectivity at a lower frequency. For the same bandwidth, a tuned circuit at a lower frequency needs a lower Q. Stated another way, for the same filter technology, a higher {{center frequency}} will take more IF filter stages to achieve the same selectivity bandwidth. Second, it is easier and less expensive to get high gain at a lower frequency. When used at high frequencies, many amplifiers show a constant gain–bandwidth product (dominant pole) characteristic. If an amplifier has a gain–bandwidth product of 100MHz, then it would have a <b>voltage</b> <b>gain</b> of 100 at 1MHz but only 10 at 10MHz.

25|$|Input offset voltage: This voltage, {{which is}} what is {{required}} across the op-amp's input terminals to drive the output voltage to zero. In the perfect amplifier, {{there would be no}} input offset voltage. However, it exists in actual op-amps because of imperfections in the differential amplifier that constitutes the input stage of the vast majority of these devices. Input offset voltage creates two problems: First, due to the amplifier's high <b>voltage</b> <b>gain,</b> it virtually assures that the amplifier output will go into saturation if it is operated without negative feedback, even when the input terminals are wired together. Second, in a closed loop, negative feedback configuration, the input offset voltage is amplified along with the signal and this may pose a problem if high precision DC amplification is required or if the input signal is very small.|$|E
25|$|Below, the <b>voltage</b> <b>gain</b> of the {{amplifier}} with feedback, the closed-loop gain AFB, {{is derived}} {{in terms of}} the gain of the amplifier without feedback, the open-loop gain AOL and the feedback factor β, which governs how much of the output signal is applied to the input (see Figure 1). The open-loop gain AOL in general may be a function of both frequency and voltage; the feedback parameter β is determined by the feedback network that is connected around the amplifier. For an operational amplifier, two resistors forming a voltage divider may be used for the feedback network to set β between 0 and 1. This network may be modified using reactive elements like capacitors or inductors to (a) give frequency-dependent closed-loop gain as in equalization/tone-control circuits or (b) construct oscillators.
