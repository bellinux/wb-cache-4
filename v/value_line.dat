Stock typically is categorised as either ongoing core lines (products bought direct from the manufacturer), seasonal ranges or clearance stock, with 10,000 new products featured each year. Initially, unbranded products stocked by Poundland (accounting for roughly 70% of total stock) would carry the Poundland branding and logo; the retailer determined that they could increase sales by removing the Poundland branding and creating around 50 sub-brands, such as Beauty Nation, Kitchen Corner and Toolbox for its <b>value</b> <b>line</b> of DIY products. Some of the products sold under the in-house brand are supplied by manufacturers who are worried about their brand being sold in discount stores and would rather allow their products to sell without their own branding attached.|$|E
2500|$|One fraud {{uncovered}} by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in November 2009 [...] may be directly credited to Sarbanes-Oxley. The fraud, which spanned nearly 20 years and involved over $24 million, was committed by <b>Value</b> <b>Line</b> (...) against its mutual fund shareholders. The fraud was first {{reported to the}} SEC in 2004 by the then <b>Value</b> <b>Line</b> Fund (...) portfolio manager and Chief Quantitative Strategist, Mr. John (Jack) R. Dempsey of Easton, Connecticut, who was required to sign a Code of Business Ethics as part of SOX. Restitution totaling $34 million {{was placed in a}} fair fund and returned to the affected <b>Value</b> <b>Line</b> mutual fund investors. [...] The Commission ordered <b>Value</b> <b>Line</b> to pay a total of $43,705,765 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalty, and ordered Buttner, CEO and Henigson, COO to pay civil penalties of $1,000,000 and $250,000, respectively. The Commission further imposed officer and director bars and broker-dealer, investment adviser, and investment company associational bars (“Associational Bars”) against Buttner and Henigson. No criminal charges were filed.|$|E

We find that <b>Value</b> <b>Line's</b> stock return and earnings forecasts exhibit large positive bias, although their sales predictions do not. For stock returns, <b>Value</b> <b>Line's</b> projections lack predictive power; for other variables predictive power may exist to some degree. Our findings suggest the spectacular past performance of the timeliness indicator reflects either close alignment with other known anomalies or data mining, and that investors and researchers should use <b>Value</b> <b>Line's</b> long-term projections with caution. ...|$|R
