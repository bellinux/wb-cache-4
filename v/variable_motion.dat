In the first example, the nonstationary spatially <b>variable</b> ground <b>motion</b> that satisfies the time-frequency characteristics and response characteristics of the original ground motion is simulated by identifying the parameters of the given time-varying power spectrum. In the second example, the ground motion that satisfies the design response spectra is simulated by defining the parameters of the time-varying power spectrum directly.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new methods}} for automatic classification and retrieval of motion capture data facilitating {{the identification of}} logically related motions scattered in some database. As the main ingredient, we introduce the concept of motion templates (MTs), by which the essence of an entire class of logically related motions can be captured in an explicit and semantically interpretable matrix representation. The key property of MTs is that the variable aspects of a motion class can be automatically masked out in the comparison with unknown motion data. This facilitates robust and efficient motion retrieval even {{in the presence of}} large spatio-temporal variations. Furthermore, we describe how to learn an MT for a specific motion class from a given set of training motions. In our extensive experiments, which are based on several hours of motion data, MTs proved to be a powerful concept for motion annotation and retrieval, yielding accurate results even for highly <b>variable</b> <b>motion</b> classes such as cartwheels, lying down, or throwing motions...|$|E

The goal of the present investigation was to research the composite materials based on 316 L stainless steel powders {{with the addition of}} calcium pyrophosphate (Ca 2 P 2 O 7).

Tribological tests were performed by a special tribometer, which allowed to realize research during the periodically <b>variable</b> <b>motion</b> with low velocity and variable values of pressure. The structure of materials was observed with scanning electron microscope (SEM). The intensive diffusion of main alloying elements brought the segregation of components and appearance of new phases.

40|$|Only the first- order Doppler {{frequency}} shift is considered in current laser dual- frequency interferometers; however; the second- order Doppler {{frequency shift}} {{should be considered}} when the measurement corner cube (MCC) moves at high velocity or variable velocity because it can cause considerable error.

Moreover, the model has been simulated with both high velocity and variable velocity motion. The simulated results show that the second- order Doppler error is proportional to the velocity of the MCC when it moves with uniform motion and the measured displacement is certain. When the MCC moves with <b>variable</b> <b>motion,</b> the second- order Doppler error concerns not only velocity but also acceleration. When muzzle velocity is zero the second- order Doppler error caused by an acceleration of 0. 6 g can be up to 2. 5 nm in 0. 4 s, which is not negligible in nanometric measurement. Moreover, when the muzzle velocity is nonzero, the accelerated motion may result in a greater error and decelerated motion may result in a smaller error...|$|E
