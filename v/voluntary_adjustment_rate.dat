The {{purpose of the present}} work was to analyze the head trajectory of 10 elite athletes, during a competition of 400 m front crawl, in order to give information regarding the path linearity of elite swimmers. The kinematic analysis of the head trajectories was performed by means of stereo-photogrammetry. Results showed that the forward speed and lateral fluctuations speed are linearly related. Multiple regression analysis of discrete Fourier transformation allowed to distinguish 3 spectral windows identifying 3 specific features: strokes (0. 7 - 5 Hz), breathings (0. 4 - 0. 7 Hz), and <b>voluntary</b> <b>adjustments</b> (0 - 0. 4 Hz), which contributed to the energy wasting for 55 %, 10 %, and 35 %, respectively. Both elite swimmers race speed and speed wastage increase while progressing from the 1 st to the 8 th length during a 400 m front crawl official competition. The main sources of the lateral fluctuations that lead to the increasing speed wastage could be significantly attributed to strokes and <b>voluntary</b> <b>adjustments,</b> while breathings contribution did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, both strokes and <b>voluntary</b> <b>adjustments</b> are the main energy consuming events that affect path linearity...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of age on automatic and <b>voluntary</b> motor <b>adjustments</b> in pointing tasks. To this end, young (20 – 25 years) and middle-aged adults (48 – 62 years) were instructed to point at a target that could unexpectedly change its location (to the left or right) or its color (to green or red) during the movement. In the location change conditions, participants were asked to either adjust their pointing movement toward the new location (i. e., normal pointing) or in the opposite direction (i. e., anti-pointing). In the color change conditions, participants were instructed to adjust their movement to the left or right depending on the change in color. The results showed that in {{a large proportion of the}} anti-pointing trials, participants made two adjustments: an early initial automatic adjustment in the direction of the target shift followed by a late <b>voluntary</b> <b>adjustment</b> toward the opposite direction. It was found that the late <b>voluntary</b> <b>adjustments</b> were delayed for the middle-aged participants relative to the young participants. There were no age differences for the fast automatic adjustment in normal pointing, but the early adjustment in anti-pointing tended to be later in the middle-aged adults. Finally, the difference in the onset of early and late adjustments in anti-pointing adjustments was greater among the middle-aged adults. Hence, this study is the first to show that aging slows down voluntary goal-directed movement control processes to greater extent than the automatic stimulus-driven processes. © 2015, The Author(s) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Channel <b>adjustment</b> and {{sedimentation}} <b>rates</b> {{are needed}} when determining stream management activities to reduce erosion and sedimentation. Channel <b>adjustment</b> <b>rates</b> are typically determined using historical channel geometry, channel profiles, and air photos, or dendrogeomorphic techniques. When {{this information is}} not available, sediment deposition rates of a downstream waterbody {{may be used as}} a surrogate for long-term channel <b>adjustment</b> <b>rates</b> in the watershed. Methods of determining sediment deposition rates include developing sediment budgets and/or radiometric (137 Cs) analysis. Using these two methods, short-term and long-term depositional rates within the Lower Cache River-Cypress Creek Wetland in southern Illinois were computed and compared. Results provide insights into the historical rate of upstream channel adjustments in the watershed. Specifically, based on sediment core data collected in 2000, the radiometric (137 Cs) analysis determined that the wetland has a long-term sediment deposition rate of 0. 86 cm/yr (1963 - 2000). The sediment budget method, based upon sediment monitoring data collected between 1986 and 2002, computed a nearly identical short-term sediment deposition rate of 0. 79 cm/yr. Since the depositional rates determined by the two methods are very similar, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the sediment deposition in the wetland, as well as the channel <b>adjustment</b> <b>rates</b> in Big Creek, have been steady since at least 1963...|$|R

Choosing the appropriate production capacity level is an important task for decision makers. The paper analyzes the characters of the short-term demand variation, the matching between the capacity and the demand, and its influence on the enterprise. Supposing the short-term demand varies seasonally, and the objective is minimum the loss of mismatch between the production capacity and market demand. Then,short-term production capacity decision model has been developed. Based on the model, this paper has probed into the mismatching loss of three strategies: fixed capacity strategy, subsection adjustment capacity strategy and dynamic adjustment capacity strategy,and an optimal capacity strategy is provided. By fixing the capacity-demand mismatching loss and changing the capacity <b>adjustment</b> <b>rate,</b> this paper also studies {{the sensitivity of the}} capacity strategy. The result shows that, firstly, as the capacity <b>adjustment</b> <b>rate</b> is less than a certain numerical value, the dynamic adjustment capacity is the optimal choice; secondly, as the capacity <b>adjustment</b> <b>rate</b> exceeds a certain numerical value, the optimal one is fixed capacity strategy; finally, as the rate falls in some specific area, the optimal one is subsection adjustment capacity strategy.

We show that corporate tax policy generates both intensive and extensive margin effects via the channel of marginal Q. Its impact is determined largely by the strength of the extensive margin effect, which in turn depends on the cross-sectional distribution of firms. Depending on the initial distribution of firms, the economy displays asymmetric responses to tax changes. We also show that an anticipated decrease in the future corporate income tax rate raises investment and <b>adjustment</b> <b>rate</b> immediately, while an anticipated increase in the future investment tax credit reduces investment and <b>adjustment</b> <b>rate</b> initially.
