40|$|The time-temperature-stress {{equivalent}} (TTSE) principle {{refers to}} the phenomenon that the time-dependent mechanical properties of materials rely on the variations of temperature and stress level. Thus, {{it is reasonable to}} predict the long time material mechanical properties based on their relationships with rising temperatures and stress levels. According to the single-integral nonlinear constitutive equation proposed by Schapery, a general expression of the TTSE principle for nonlinear viscoelastic creep property is deduced. The specific expression for time-temperature-stress shift factor is presented by assuming quadratic polynomial form of the Doolittle formula for the viscosity as a function of free <b>volume.</b> <b>Creep</b> curves of granite at different temperatures and stress levels are introduced, and the validation of applying time-temperature-stress principle to predict the long time creep property of granite is provided. The master curves are generated through vertical shift modification and horizontal shift equivalence of all creep curves, and corresponding coefficients in the shift equations are determined by curve fittings. The results indicate the modified time-temperature-stress equivalent relation is appropriate to predict the long time creep property of granite. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|E

30|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper evaluates the effect of recycled aggregate quality on the properties of concrete. Evaluation of the aggregate physical and mechanical properties showed an acceptable variation in properties when samples were collected and evaluated from unknown source over 6  months. However, limitations in gradation requirements; high absorption and aggregate strength could be resolved during the proportioning stage and by achieving high packing density. Furthermore, concrete produced utilizing different combination of coarse and fine aggregate without alteration in particle size or distribution showed that comparable compressive, flexural, splitting strength, and modulus of elasticity could be achieved. All mixes except Mix 1, 2, 5 did not show acceptable performance in the RCPT because of the high porosity supported by the examination of the microstructure of the hardened concrete. High concrete porosity and permeability might be attributed to the variability in aggregate gradation and existence of contamination. It is also important to monitor the long-term performance and <b>volume</b> change (<b>creep</b> and shrinkage) to have better assessment of the concrete produced with recycled aggregate.|$|R
40|$|Diffusivity in {{defected}} crystals depends strongly on {{the interactions}} among vacancies and interstitials. Here we present atomistic analyses of point-defect cluster (PDC) concentrations and their kinetic barriers to diffusion in ferritic or body-centered-cubic (bcc) iron supersaturated with carbon. Among all possible point-defect species, only monovacancies, divacancies, and the PDC containing one vacancy and two carbon atoms {{are found to}} be statistically abundant. We find that the migration barriers of these vacancy-carbon PDCs are sufficiently high compared to that of monovacancies and divacancies. This leads to decreased self-diffusivity in bcc Fe with increasing carbon content for any given vacancy concentration, which becomes negligible when the local interstitial carbon concentration approaches twice that of free vacancies. These results contrast with trends observed in fcc Fe and provide a plausible explanation for the experimentally observed carbon dependence of <b>volume</b> diffusion-mediated <b>creep</b> in ferritic (bcc) Fe-C alloys. Moreover, this approach represents a general framework to predict self-diffusivity in alloys comprising a spectrum of point-defect clusters based on an energy-landscape survey of local energy minima (formation energies governing concentrations) and saddle points (activation barriers governing mobility).

40|$|New {{procedures}} involving depth-sensing indentation {{are used}} to measure the submicron scale elastic modulus, hardness, viscosity, and activation energy and <b>volume</b> for <b>creep</b> of amorphous selenium below glass transition. The accurate measurement of Young's modulus in a highly viscoelastic situation using depth-sensing indentation remains a challenge, and a creep correction procedure is employed here to measure the modulus. The measured Young's modulus exhibits a strong decreasing trend from ∼ 10 GPa to 4. 4 GPa as temperature increases from ∼ 302 K to 309 K, in reasonably good agreement with bulk behavior. Two new procedures are also proposed here to measure the viscosity. The measured shear viscosity decreases from ∼ 1 × 1012 Pa-s to ∼ 2 × 1010 Pa-s when the temperature increases over the same range, and the variation with temperature is found to obey an Arrehnius rate equation. The activation energy for the viscous creep process is found to be ∼ 463 kJ/mol. Both the viscosity and the activation energy are lower than the bulk values, and this is thought to be due to the much higher stress levels of over 200 MPa involved in the nanoindentation experiments here. The apparent activation volume exhibits a rising trend from 1. 04 × 10 - 31 to 2. 35 × 10 - 30 m 3 over the same temperature range.

If the seismic anelasticity {{can be used as a}} guide the average viscosity of the lower mantle is about 10 ^(23) P. Combined with previous estimates of the upper mantle viscosity this gives a relaxation time of about 3000 years for the non-equilibrium bulge of the Earth. This is close to the time from the last ice age but is much less than the 10 ^ 7 years required if the non-equilibrium bulge is due to the changing rate of rotation which requires an average mantle viscosity of 10 ^(26) P.

40|$|Inoculation is {{the most}} common grain {{refining}} technique during metal/alloy castings. However, only a small fraction, typically 1 ~ 2 %, of inoculants serve as nucleation sites while most of them do not participate in the nucleation event and hence they are termed ‘inactive’ inoculants. But ‘inactive’ does not mean ‘useless’. Our recent studies showed some extra merits of the inoculated particles. In Mg- 10 wt%Y cast alloy, addition of 1 wt%Al leads to in-situ formation of Al 2 Y particles. Small fraction of the particles acts as effective nucleation sites and refines the grains by 5 times. The majority of Al 2 Y particles segregate along the grain boundaries (GBs). They inhibit the GB migration so that the grain size still keeps constant after solution treatment at 550 °C for 2 days. In contrast, addition of 0. 5 wt%Y in Mg- 9 wt%Al results coarsening of Mg grains by 3 times. The reduction of GB <b>volume</b> reduces its <b>creep</b> strain rate by 5 times at 150 °C. However, its room temperature strength is still well maintained despite of grain coarsening.

In this work we evaluate solar and internal (owing to radioactive decay of U, 7 ’h and 401 { in Pluto’s inferred core) heat sources and their corresponding mechanisms for predicted erup-tive activity on Pluto. For the internal energy supply, a model of conductive-convective heat and mass transport on Triton (Duxbury and Brown 1997) is applied to Pluto’s solid N 2 layer. Previous models of the solid-state convection for different celestial bodies con-sidered only simple parametrized convect ion in H 2 O ice.

40|$|Use of Gulf Coast salt domes for {{construction}} of very large storage caverns by solution mining has grown significantly {{in the last several}} decades. In fact, a nationally important Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) storage occurs in large cavern arrays in some of these domes. Although caverns have been operated economically for these many years, these caverns have a range of relatively poorly understood behaviors, involving creep closure fluid loss and damage from salt falls. It is certainly possible to postulate that many of these behaviors stem from geomechanical or deformational aspects of the salt response. As a result, a method of correlating the cavern response to mechanical creep behavior as determined in the laboratory could be of considerable importance. Recently, detailed study of the creep response of domal salts has cast some insight into the influence of different salt origins on cavern behavior. The study used a simple graphical analysis of the limited non-steady state data to give a bound, or an approach to steady state, as an estimate of the steady state behavior of a given domal salt. This permitted the analysis of sparse creep databases for domal salts. It appears that a shortcoming of the steady state analysis was in masking some of the salt material differences. In an attempt to overcome the steady state analysis shortcomings, a method was developed based on the integration of the Multimechanism-Deformation (M-D) creep constitutive model to fit the transient response. This integration process essentially permits definition of the material sensitive parameters of the model, while those parameters that are either constants or material insensitive parameters are fixed independently. The transient analysis method has proven more sensitive to differences in the creep characteristics and has provided a way of defining different behaviors within a given dome. Creep characteristics, as defined by the transient analysis of the creep rate, are related quantitatively to the <b>volume</b> loss <b>creep</b> rate of the caverns. This type of understanding of the domal material creep response already has pointed to the possibility of establishing various distinct material spines within a given dome. Furthermore, if the creep databases for domal salts can be expanded, one could expect additional definition of domal geology and structure...|$|R

Determination of wear of the polyethylene knee inserts {{has been an important}} subject in improving the longevity of TKR. Accurate wear measurement methodologies are essential to differentiate between the performance of different materials and designs because the geometry changes can be small and can consist of both wear and creep. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a coordinate based threedimensional volumetric determination methodology using CMM and Micro-CT measurement techniques. The validation of the methodology was carried out using a FE model and computational volume removal test.

Finally, the methodology was applied to evaluate both simulator and retrieval specimens. The studies indicated the presented volumetric determination methodology was not dependent on pre-wear data, CAD model or original design drawings and can be used for both simulator and retrieval analysis at relevant levels of wear and creep. It can also be applied to the biotribological study of other polyethylene components, since wear and damage can be assessed visually and volumetrically. The comparison between CMM and Micro-CT methods suggested that the CMM has higher accuracy and better repeatability.

40|$|There {{have existed}} {{for some time}} {{relatively}} sparse creep databases {{for a number of}} domal salts. Although all of these data were analyzed at the time they were reported, to date {{there has not been a}} comprehensive, overall evaluation within the same analysis framework. Such an evaluation may prove of value. The analysis methodology is based on the Multimechanism Deformation (M-D) description of salt creep and the corresponding model parameters determined from conventional creep tests. The constitutive model of creep wss formulated through application of principles involved in micromechanical modeling. It was possible, at minimum, to obtain the steady state parameters of the creep model from the data on the domal salts. When this was done, the creep of the domal salts, as compared to the well-defined Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) bedded clean salt, was either essentially identical to, or significantly harder (more creep resistant) than WIPP salt. Interestingly, the domal salts form two distinct groups, either sofl or hard, where the difference is roughly a factor often in creep rate between the twcl groups. As might be expected, this classification corresponds quite well to the differences in magnitude of effective <b>creep</b> <b>volume</b> losses of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) caverns as determined by the CAVEMAN cavern pressure history analysis, depending upon the specific dome or region within the dome.

40|$|The use {{of thermal}} barrier {{coatings}} {{over the past}} few decades has signi?cantly improved the performance of gas turbine engines by reducing the operating temper-ature of engine components. However, these multilayer systems are not able to be used to their full potential due to the di?culty of accurately modeling the complex interplay of physical phenomena, such as creep and oxidation, that contribute to failure. In order to address this issue, more physics-based failure prediction models need to be developed. One potential way to do this is through the use of dislocation dynamics (DD) models. A DD framework was recently developed which incorporates high temperature e?ects such as vacancy di?usion assisted dislocation climb in ad-dition to dislocation glide. However, the e?ects of certain parameters on simulations of dislocation creep had been unexplored. In particular, the e?ect of the distance required for a dislocation to climb to a new slip plane, the critical climb distance, was not evaluated and the vacancy relaxation volume was set at zero, negating its e?ect on the calculation of vacancy di?usion. The present work aims to address this by studying the e?ect of the critical climb distance and the vacancy relaxation <b>volume</b> on the <b>creep</b> response of micron scale single crystals.

40|$|Simple {{scalings}} {{suggest that}} super-Earths {{are more likely}} than an equivalent Earth-sized planet to be undergoing plate tectonics. Generally, viscosity and thermal conductivity increase with pressure while thermal expansivity decreases, resulting in lower convective vigor in the deep mantle. According to conventional thinking, this might result in no convection in a super-Earth's deep mantle. Here we evaluate this. First, we here extend the density functional theory (DFT) calculations of post-perovskite activation enthalpy of to a pressure of 1 TPa. The activation <b>volume</b> for diffusion <b>creep</b> becomes very low at very high pressure, but nevertheless for the largest super-Earths the viscosity along an adiabat may approach 1030 Pa s in the deep mantle. Second, we use these calculated values in numerical simulations of mantle convection and lithosphere dynamics of planets with up to ten Earth masses. The models assume a compressible mantle including depth-dependence of material properties and plastic yielding induced plate tectonics. Results confirm the likelihood of plate tectonics and show a novel self-regulation of deep mantle temperature. The deep mantle is not adiabatic; instead internal heating raises the temperature until the viscosity is low enough to facilitate convective loss of the radiogenic heat, which results in a super-adiabatic temperature profile and a viscosity increase with depth of no more than ~ 3 orders of magnitude, regardless of the viscosity increase that is calculated for an adiabat. Convection in large super-Earths is characterised by large upwellings and small, time-dependent downwellings. If a super-Earth was extremely hot/molten after its formation, it is thus likely that even after billions of years its deep interior is still extremely hot and possibly substantially molten with a "super basal magma ocean" - a larger version of (Labrosse et al., 2007).

40|$|Deinking {{residues}} (DR) {{are produced}} in the first steps of paper recycling. Most of the Quebec's production, approximately 500 000 humid tons per year, is still sent to dedicated landfills. However, new DR valorization approaches have been proposed, such as their use as geotechnical replacement material for fine-textured soil {{in the construction of}} cover systems for landfills or tailings that generate acid mine drainage (AMD). Due to the high organic content of DR, biochemical and chemical evolution (degradation) can take place and impact not only the environment that they aim to protect, but also the geotechnical properties of DR. In this context, {{the purpose of this study}} was to understand DR degradation mechanisms, evaluate their long-term state, and appraise the impact of degradation on the behaviour of DR in the laboratory and in the field. To attain this goal, this study was divided into three steps: (1 st) DR characterization; (2 nd) laboratory degradation tests; and (3 rd) evaluation of DR degradation in the field. According to tests carried out, it is possible to state that DR degradation follows the degradation phases of domestic waste in sanitary landfills, from the point of view of biogas production evolution as well as the quality of leachate parameters. After 400 days of tests under controlled conditions, a total mass loss of approximately 16 % was obtained for the tests at 38 [degrés Celcius] and 21 [degrés Celcius]. The loss for a test at 12 [degrés Celcius] was approximately 10 %. In the case of the tests at 38 [degrés Celcius], the mass loss by gas production became greater than that by leaching. Microbiology studies identified bacilli and fluorescent sarcina as the predominant morphologies, although they were not as numerous compared to what can be found in domestic wastes. Based solely on observations with the naked eye or with a low-level magnification electronic microscope, it isn't possible to observe a noticeable change in DR appearance, structure and morphology. However, with stronger magnification, we observe areas with significant alteration, accompanied by high microorganism density. Geotechnical tests and monitoring of certain geomechanical and hydraulic parameters show that: degradation caused an increase in water content; degradation affects DR compressibility and causes a decrease in hydraulic conductivity. With loading, DR undergoes significant <b>volume</b> variations (<b>creep),</b> which are potentialized by degradation. Field results demonstrate that several follow-up parameters evolved very similarly in the case of barriers installed at the Eustis and Clinton mine tailings, notably biogas composition ([approximate] 40 % CH[subscript 4] and [approximate] 50 % CO[subscript 2]) and the quality of leachate collected (concentration in total solids around 25 g/l). However, mass loss by leaching is slow, due to low infiltration speeds (evaluated based on water collected in lysimeters). According to the results obtained and observations made during this study, the relevant properties of DR do not seem to be negatively affected by the degradation level attained in the laboratory...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of evaporitic formations in sedimentary basins, often {{dominated by the}} salt mineral halite, is of great influence on the structural style developed during tectonic events. On a somewhat smaller scale, salt rocks often host a variety of deep solution mined caverns, which are increasingly finding use for strategic storage of energy resources {{in the form of}} gaseous or liquid fuels and as vessels for off-peak energy storage in compressed gas. This is in addition to the use of conventionally mined galleries for the long term storage of hazardous waste materials. The low permeability of most salt rocks, with weak rheological behaviour and tendency to self-seal, has attracted engineers to use salt formations to host such projects. The Zechstein salt deposits in the Netherlands exist in the form of original beds and as migrated salt domes/pillows that may reach the kilometre scale. Some contain magnesium rich salts which are solution mined as an economic resource. Caverns constructed within these more soluble and weaker materials pose additional challenges for long term storage management. Careful management of fluid filled caverns requires a full knowledge of the rheological and transport properties of the host salt formations for a safe operation into the future. This thesis addresses a number of deficiencies in the current knowledge of salt mechanical behaviour regarding the creep of halite and its mixtures with magnesium salts. (1) The pressure sensitivity of creep was investigated, using dry synthetic halite rock. The rate controlling mechanism in the temperature range 22 - 350 oC was found to change from dislocation glide to dislocation climb. The experimental results allow quantification of the activation <b>volume</b> for <b>creep.</b> (2) The transition from creep governed by grain size sensitive (GSI) dislocation mechanisms to creep controlled by grain size sensitive (GSS) solution-precipitation mechanisms was studied on the basis of multi-step deformation experiments with constant strain rate parts and stress relaxation. Stress exponents n of conventional creep laws changed from ~ 10 at relatively high stress and strain rate to ~ 1 {{at the end of the}} relaxation steps. (3) The rheology of the magnesium bearing salts carnallite and bischofite was also investigated by means of multistep experiments including relaxation. Special attention was given to the mechanical behaviour of mixtures of these salts with halite. Both bischofite and carnallite, tested at real in situ conditions of temperature 70 oC and pressure 40 MPa, showed a change from GSI creep to GSS creep comparable to what was found for wet halite. n-values changed from ~ 5 to ~ 1. Composite GSI-GSS flow laws for bischofite and carnallite were established. (4) The effects of compositional layering on permeable transport in the excavation damage zones around mined cavities were investigated by argon gas permeability, using natural layered material from mines in China, to better understand effects of bedding orientation relative to deformational stresses expected in cavity and gallery walls at depth. Microstructural investigation revealed that local dilatancy occurred at interfaces, which must have given rice to a local increase in permeability...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Concrete water {{retaining}} structures (WRS) in South Africa are under scrutiny {{due to the}} numerous durability problems that they have experienced lately; despite the efforts by local and national authorities in conserving these structures. At the heart of these problems are the creep and shrinkage phenomena. While shrinkage is the reduction of concrete <b>volume</b> with time, <b>creep</b> {{is defined as the}} time-dependent increase of concrete strain under constant or controlled stress. Both phenomena are affected by conditions to which WRS are exposed hence their accurate prediction is required. Numerical models have been developed to calculate the extent to which concrete creeps or shrinks over time. The objective of this thesis is to identify which of these models is better equipped to be used in South African WRS design. This is achieved through a systematic method that involves an investigation into the contents of these models and a statistical comparison of model calculations to WRS representative data. In partnership with reputable universities, a pioneer experimental creep and shrinkage data base is created in this project from which the WRS related data is selected. While investigating the contents of the numerical models, their applicability to South African WRS is identified and the integrity of model contents is assessed. Indeed, a few irregularities are found in the process and are presented in this thesis. The model calculations are statistically compared to data in the form of individual experiments {{as well as in the}} form of groups of experiments with similar concretes to find the ideal prediction model for different types of concretes as well. Also pioneered in this project is a weighted criteria and point system in which the findings of the model content assessment and statistical evaluations are incorporated. It is based on this system that conclusions are drawn and the most suitable prediction model for WRS design in South Africa is selected...|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} a ductile fault zone is {{incorporated}} into a forward 3 -D earthquake model to better constrain fault-zone hydraulics. The conceptual framework of the model fault zone was chosen such that two distinct parts are recognized. The fault core, characterized by a relatively low permeability, is composed of a coseismic fault surface embedded in a visco-elastic <b>volume</b> that can <b>creep</b> and compact. The fault core is surrounded by, and mostly sealed from, a high permeability damaged zone. The model fault properties correspond explicitly {{to those of the}} coseismic fault core. Porosity and pore pressure evolve to account for the viscous compaction of the fault core, while stresses evolve in response to the applied tectonic loading and to shear creep of the fault itself. A small diffusive leakage is allowed {{in and out of the}} fault zone. Coseismically, porosity is created to account for frictional dilatancy. We show in the case of a 3 -D fault model with no in-plane flow and constant fluid compressibility, pore pressures do not drop to hydrostatic levels after a seismic rupture, leading to an overpressured weak fault. Since pore pressure plays a key role in the fault behaviour, we investigate coseismic hydraulic property changes. In the full 3 -D model, pore pressures vary instantaneously by the poroelastic effect during the propagation of the rupture. Once the stress state stabilizes, pore pressures are incrementally redistributed in the failed patch. We show that the significant effect of pressure-dependent fluid compressibility in the no in-plane flow case becomes a secondary effect when the other spatial dimensions are considered because in-plane flow with a near-lithostatically pressured neighbourhood equilibrates at a pressure much higher than hydrostatic levels, forming persistent high-pressure fluid compartments. If the observed faults are not all overpressured and weak, other mechanisms, not included in this model, must be at work in nature, which need to be investigated. Significant leakage perpendicular to the fault strike (in the case of a young fault), or cracks hydraulically linking the fault core to the damaged zone (for a mature fault) are probable mechanisms for keeping the faults strong and might play a significant role in modulating fault pore pressures. Therefore, fault-normal hydraulic properties of fault zones should be a future focus of field and numerical experiment...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} the characterisation of actual welded samples of P 91 - a 9 %Cr heat resisting steel that is widely used for pressure vessels in the power generation industry. Although the creep resistance of the normalised and tempered base steel is excellent, weld fabrication compromises creep performance because of degraded properties in the heat affected zone (HAZ). In order to elucidate the structure and properties of the HAZ, dilatometer heat treatments and simulations of HAZ sub-zones were carried out using both a dilatometer and a Gleeble thermo-mechanical simulator. The simulated samples were used to study the microstructure of the HAZ sub-zones and to subject them to creep testing. In actual welding, post weld heat treatment (PWHT) is used to produce a uniform tempered martensite structure across the weldment, making it difficult to distinguish the HAZ sub-zones and the boundary with the unaffected base plate. Nevertheless, hardness profiles across the HAZ and measurements within the sub-zones confirmed that softening occurs below the base plate hardness after PWHT in the intercritical (IC) and grain refined (GR) sub-zones. The creep fracture times of cross-weld creep samples were also lower than parent metal because of type IV fracture in these HAZ sub-zones. Dilatometric investigations shed new light on the sensitivity of the properties of the martensite to the thermal cycle associated with austenitisation and subsequent cooling. The AC 1 and AC 3 temperatures were increased with increasing heating rate and MS was lower for a lower heating rate. MS was found to vary from 420 °C to 370 °C and the hardness of the martensite from 365 to 480 HV, depending on the thermal cycle. This varialibilty is due to the extent of carbide solution. There was a marked increase in hardness with increasing peak temperature of the thermal cycle, but subsequent simulated PWHT substantially decreased the hardness and the hardness range of the simulated sub-zones. An excellent correlation was found between the structures and properties of the HAZ of the actual welds and the simulated sub-zones produced by both dilatometric and Gleeble techniques. It was established that the heat input (1. 6 or 2. 6 kJ/mm) had only a minor effect on the microstructure and hardness of Gleeble simulated sub-zone samples. TEM results confirmed the presence of coarse Cr-rich, M 23 C 6 and fine V-and Nb-rich, MC in all simulated sub-zones, before and after PWHT, except for the as simulated GCHAZ in which carbide solution occurred. Accelerated creep testing showed rapid creep failure of both AR and simulated IC and GR sub-zone samples for testing at higher temperatures in the range of 630 °C to 670 °C and at a higher stress, 100 MPa compared to 80 MPa. Failure was associated with high creep ductility and the phenomenon of rehardening in the region adjacent to the neck due to rapid work hardening prior to fracture. This type of failure has been labelled Mode 1 and is characterised structurally by grains and creep cavities that are strongly elongated parallel to the tensile axis. Another characteristic type of creep failure, Mode 2, exhibits a low creep ductility and transversely aligned creep cavities. This mode was found in notched AR samples and notched simulated GCHAZ samples tested at 630 °C and a stress at 80 MPa. However, for both Mode 1 and 2 failures, non-metallic inclusions were found to {{play a significant role in}} the nucleation of creep cracking and cavition. The research work identified that the GRHAZ is the most creep susceptible HAZ sub-zone because the thermal cycle results in carbide coarsening, reduced precipitation and solid solution strengthening and a high γ prior grain boundary surface area/unit <b>volume.</b> The <b>creep</b> resistance was most marked for the simulated GCHAZ samples and this property relates strongly to the hardness of the P 91 steel prior to creep testing. The important role of non-metallic inclusions in the nucleation of creep cracking and cavitation indicates that control of the type, size distribution and content of inclusions should have a significant effect on the creep life of P 91 steel...|$|R

The full text may be available through the publisher links provided above. Inconel 617 is a solid-solution-strengthened Ni-based superalloy {{with a small amount of}} gamma prime (γ′) present. Here, samples are examined in the as-received condition and after creep exposure at 923 K (650 °C) for 574 hours and 45, 000 hours and at 973 K (700 °C) for 4000 hours. The stress levels are intermediate (estimated, respectively, as of the order of 350, 275, and 200 MPa) and at levels of interest for the future operation of power plant. The hardness of the specimens has been measured in the gage length and the head. TEM thin foils have been obtained to quantify dislocation densities (3. 5 × 10 [Superscript: 13] for the as-received, 5. 0 × 10 [Superscript: 14], 5. 9 × 10 [Superscript: 14], and 3. 5 × 10 [Superscript: 14] lines/m[Superscript: 2] for the creep-exposed specimens, respectively). There are no previous data in the literature for dislocation densities in this alloy after creep exposure. There is some evidence from the dislocation densities that for the creep-exposed samples, the higher hardness in the gage length in comparison with the creep test specimen head is due to work hardening rather than any other effect. Carbon replicas have been used to extract gamma prime precipitates. The morphology of γ′ precipitates in the ‘as-received’ condition was spheroidal with an average diameter of 18 nm. The morphology of these particles does not change with creep exposure but the size increases to 30 nm after 574 hours at 923 K (650 °C) but with little coarsening in 45, 000 hours. At 973 K (700 °C) 4000 hours, the average gamma prime size is 32 nm. In the TEM images of the replicas, the particles overlap, and therefore, a methodology has been developed to estimate the volume fraction of gamma prime in the alloy given the carbon replica film thickness. The results are 5. 8 vol pct in the as-received and then 2. 9, 3. 2, and 3. 4 vol pct, respectively, for the creep-exposed specimens. The results are compared with predictions from thermodynamic analysis given the alloy compositions. Thermodynamic prediction shows that nitrogen content is important in determining the gamma prime volume fraction. This has not previously been identified in the literature. The higher the nitrogen content, the lower the gamma prime volume fraction. This may explain inconsistencies between previous experimental estimates of gamma prime volume fraction in the literature and the results here. The observed decrease in the γ′ <b>volume</b> fraction with <b>creep</b> exposure would correspond to an increase in TiN. At present, there are insufficient experimental data to prove that this predicted relationship occurs in practice. However, it is observed that there is a higher volume fraction of TiN precipitates in the gage length of a creep sample than in the head. This suggests that secondary TiN particles are precipitating at the expense of existing γ′ due to the ingress of N from the atmosphere, possibly via creep cracks penetrating in from the surface of the gage length. This effect is not expected to be observed in real components which are much larger and operate in different atmospheres. However, this highlights the need to be conscious of this possibility when carrying out creep testing. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project was to modify the matrix polymer’s relaxation processes by the inclusion of filler and to characterise the interfacial interaction in between matrix polymer and filler. Three types of elastomers were selected for {{this research}}: a purely amorphous elastomer (poly(ethylene-co-propylene) diene monomer) (EPDM), a semi-crystalline elastomer (poly(ethylene-co-methyl acrylate)) (EMA) and a thermoplastic elastomer (thermoplastic polyurethane) (TPU). These elastomers possessed reinforcement via chemical crosslinking, crystalline molecular segments and hydrogen bonding. Fillers {{in the form of}} aluminas (with EPDM) and fumed silicas (with EMAs and TPUs) were added to the elastomers to form composites. Materials were prepared via a solvent casting method. Elastomers were dissolved in an appropriate solvent and fillers were added. A crosslinking agent was also added to the dissolved EPDM. Fillers were dispersed with ultrasonication after which dissolved elastomerfiller compositions were dried then pressed into films. EPDM composites underwent thermally-induced crosslinking. Characterizing techniques including environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), thermogravimetry and analytical techniques including dynamic force thermomechanometry (df-TM), static force thermomechanometry (sf-TM) and modulated force thermomechanometry (mf-TM) were used to examine the interaction between filler and elastomer. Analysis was performed on data from sf-TM (4 -element model for creep analysis data, Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts model for recovery analysis data) and mf-TM (Debye, Cole-Cole, Cole-Davidson and Havriliak-Negami relaxation equations). Mastercurves were created from multi-frequency mf-TM data. Sinusoidal frequency mode was determined to be the best method for obtaining multi-frequency data and the HN-based mastercurve method was the best method for constructing mastercurves. The accuracy of three different shift factor models (Williams-Landel-Ferry, Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann-Hesse and arctan based V’ant model) was compared. Super-mastercurves were constructed from mastercurves. ESEM micrographs of EPDM materials revealed that greater compatibility between elastomer and filler resulted in better dispersion of filler. All elastomers were observed to have thermal reinforcement provided by the presence of fillers. Greater compatibility between elastomer and filler resulted in increased thermal stability, as seen in EPDM composites. Thermal reinforcement was observed to increase with increasing silica volume fraction with the Abstract xxiii temperature of 50 %. w/w loss increasing by approximately 20 °C for the EMA-based materials and by 70 °C for the TPU-based materials at the highest filler volume fraction. Stress-strain analysis data indicated that composites were tougher with greater compatibility between filler and elastomer matrix. The Young’s moduli and strength of all elastomer based systems were observed to increase, but toughness decreased with increasing filler <b>volume</b> fraction. <b>Creep</b> and recovery analysis showed that greater compatibility between filler and elastomer, and increased filler volume fraction resulted in more resistance to elastic and viscoelastic deformation, and viscous flow. Modelling of creep analysis data revealed that the presence of any filler resulted in increased resistance to instantaneous and time dependant uncoiling and extension of molecules. Increasing filler volume fraction resulted in greater resistance to instantaneous and time dependant uncoiling of molecules, and irreversible flow. Materials analysed with a reduced force had greater resistance to all modes of deformation as indicated by their parameter values being greater than those obtained at a higher force. Modelling of recovery analysis data revealed greater compatibility between filler and elastomer resulted in less resistance to recovery and less constraints to the operation of relaxation modes. Resistance to recovery decreased with increasing filler volume fraction. Relaxation times decreased with increasing filler volume fraction. Parameter values obtained from analyses conducted with reduced analysis force indicated that a lower analysis force resulted in less resistance to viscoelastic recovery, longer relaxation times and fewer constraints to the operation of relaxation modes. Modulated force thermomechanometry characterised the elasticity and damping properties of materials. The storage modulus was observed to increase with increasing filler volume fraction; however increased compatibility between filler and elastomer resulted in reduced E′ values. The temperature of failure increased with compatibility and increasing filler volume fraction. The loss modulus was observed to increase with increasing filler volume fraction; however increased compatibility between filler and elastomer resulted in lower loss of energy. The tan d values decreased with the addition of any filler and increasing filler volume fraction; however increased compatibility between filler and elastomer reduced the tan d by a lesser amount. Mastercurves were constructed from the isothermal multi-frequency mf-TM data for the EMA and TPU series of materials. They possessed frequency ranges of approximately 10 - 9 – 1017 Hz. The storage modulus mastercurve data values were observed to increase with increasing filler volume fraction for all materials. The storage modulus values plateaued at Abstract xxiv 10 %. v/v filler. The loss modulus mastercurves of both EMA and TPU-based materials possessed a peak in the loss modulus data corresponding to Tg. The materials plateaued at approximately the same modulus values at the highest transposed frequencies. The modulus data obtained at the highest analysis frequencies exhibited constructive interference with the effects most pronounced in the highest filled composites. The WLF model most accurately modelled shift factor values with respect to temperature. The Wicket error function was used to determine the accuracy of modelling with the relaxation equations. The HN equation modelled the mastercurve data most accurately. The zero and infinite modulus HN parameter values increased with increasing silica volume fraction. The infinite modulus values plateaued at 10 %. v/v filler at the highest transposed frequencies. The relaxation time parameter values increased with increasing filler volume fraction while the a and b shape parameters were observed to overall decrease. Mastercurves could not be constructed for EPDM-based materials as they could not be analysed at sufficiently high frequencies, so single frequency mf-TM data was used with the HN relaxation equation. The addition of compatibilized filler resulted in an increase in E∞ modulus values while the uncompatabilzed filler caused a reduction. The a shape parameter was observed to decrease with the addition of all fillers with the untreated filler resulting in the greatest reduction. The b shape parameter was observed to slightly decrease with the addition of the compatibilized fillers but increase with the addition of the uncompatabilzed filler. The calculated relaxation times were observed to decrease with decreasing compatibility between filler and elastomer. ...|$|R
