50|$|An {{inner join}} {{requires}} each {{row in the}} two joined tables to have matching <b>column</b> <b>values,</b> and is a commonly used join operation in applications but should not be assumed {{to be the best}} choice in all situations. Inner join creates a new result table by combining <b>column</b> <b>values</b> of two tables (A and B) based upon the join-predicate. The query compares each row of A with each row of B to find all pairs of rows which satisfy the join-predicate. When the join-predicate is satisfied by matching non-NULL <b>values,</b> <b>column</b> <b>values</b> for each matched pair of rows of A and B are combined into a result row.|$|R

I thank Michael Weisbach (the editor) and an {{anonymous}} referee for suggestions that greatly improved the paper. 1 This appendix to “Empire-Building or Bridge-Building? Evidence from New CEOs’ Internal Capital Allocation Decisions ” is organized in two sections. The first section reports {{the results of}} robustness checks. The second section discusses the tests for alternative explanations. 1. Robustness Checks This section reports {{the results of the}} robustness checks described in Section 2. 2 of the paper. I change various aspects of the specification in equation (1) in the paper, including the following: the definition of specialists and generalists; the scaling of capital expenditures in the investment ratios; the time frame around turnover; and the composition of the sample. Table A 1 reports the robustness results, focusing on the regression specification used in <b>Column</b> <b>V</b> of Table 3 in the paper. Specifically, I use the industry-adjusted investment ratio as the dependent variable, and include segment Q and segment cash flow as control variables. Using the unadjusted ratio as the dependent variable and adding in more control variables produce similar results.
