5|$|In {{shells of}} most of the species in the {{subgenus}} Amphidromus, resting stages are marked by the deposition of a brown or black radial band called a <b>varix.</b> This appears to be rare in the subgenus Syndromus, although the shell of A. laevus does show evidence of interruption of the spiral banding after a resting phase.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species of}} Blanfordia have a shell with <b>varix.</b>|$|E
25|$|Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni (Bartsch, 1946) - It has a small, smooth shell {{but with}} no <b>varix,</b> is found in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.|$|E
25|$|Amphidromus perversus perversus f. perversus Linnaeus, 1758, {{is a solid}} {{yellow shell}} with black <b>varix</b> and narrow black band behind the peristome. It is known from {{the whole range of}} the species.|$|E
25|$|Oncomelania hupensis tangi (Bartsch, 1936) - It has {{a smooth}} shell but with thick <b>varix,</b> {{is found in}} Fujian {{province}} and Guangxi autonomous region, separated geographically from the Yangtze River, and extensive control measures have brought this subspecies to near extinction.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} solid, polished, amphidromine, {{moderately}} large (45–55mm) high, usually {{with a dark}} <b>varix.</b> Lip and callus white; ground color white, orange, yellow, or yellowish-green. Many specimens with interrupted or continuous radial brownish streaks covering part {{or all of the}} whorls on the lower spire and body whorl.|$|E
25|$|This weakly {{characterized}} race differs {{primarily by}} its intense color, strong color zone, and slight white margin at the suture. Of seventeen shells collected in May, 1954, by Hoogerwerf at Telaga Kastoba, Bawean Island, ten were dextral and seven sinistral. Three lacked a <b>varix,</b> one was grass green in color, three were whitish, and thirteen had yellow ground color. The name sankapurus Fruhstorfer, 1905, refers to white shells {{with a very}} dark color band. This variation is similar to Amphidromus perversus butoti.|$|E
25|$|Oncomelania hupensis hupensis (Gredler, 1881) - in China. It is {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} subspecies of Oncomelania hupensis and lives primarily at low altitude but a few populations live in hilly areas in the drainage area of the Yangtze River in mainland China. It has <b>varix,</b> no matter whether the shell is smooth or ribbed, but most populations have ribbed-shell. Oncomelania hupensis hupensis has the same shell growth allometry as Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni but has a longer shell on average.|$|E
500|$|Esophageal varices {{often do}} not have {{symptoms}} until they rupture. A ruptured <b>varix</b> is considered a medical emergency, because varices can bleed a lot. A bleeding <b>varix</b> may cause a person to vomit blood, or suffer shock. To deal with a ruptured <b>varix,</b> a band may be placed around the bleeding blood vessel, or {{a small amount of}} a clotting agent may be injected near the bleed. A surgeon may also try to use a small inflatable balloon to apply pressure to stop the wound. IV fluids and blood products [...] may be given in order to prevent hypovolemia from excess blood loss.|$|E
500|$|The egg-shaped {{shell of}} this species usually grows to 40–55mm in length (1 1/2" [...] - 2 1/8") (the maximum {{recorded}} shell length is 121mm (4.76in)). It is thick and solid, with a moderately high spire and rounded body whorl, and adult specimens have approximately five whorls. The protoconch is rounded, colored cream with an orange to brown apex. The teleoconch is sculptured by spiral grooves crossed by mostly rather faint growth lines. Its surface varies {{in the degree of}} shell sculpture that is present. Some shells are completely smooth with a high gloss, whereas other shells are grooved. The surface of some shells is granulated, and some even have nodules on the shoulders of the whorls. Several times at different growth stages, the shell develops a thick outer lip, which is characteristic of the subfamily Cassinae. The snail rests between each of these stages of growth, and usually absorbs the entire outer lip before it begins to grow again. In some cases, especially in deep water, the Scotch bonnet does not absorb the outer lip completely, leaving behind a <b>varix</b> on the whorls of the mature shell.|$|E

50|$|A saphena <b>varix,</b> or a saphenous <b>varix</b> is a {{dilation}} of the {{saphenous vein}} at its junction with the femoral vein in the groin. Saphena <b>varix</b> {{is a common}} surgical problem. Patient can present with a groin swelling due to saphena <b>varix.</b>|$|E
50|$|Injection {{sclerotherapy}} {{has been}} used to treat esophageal varices since the 1960s. A sheathed needle is passed through a channel in the endoscope, unsheathed and pushed into a <b>varix.</b> A sclerosing agent, such as ethanolamine or absolute alcohol, is then injected into the <b>varix</b> to cause scarring and constriction of the <b>varix</b> with the aim of obliterating the <b>varix</b> (or varices). This technique has now largely been superseded by variceal band ligation.|$|E

50|$|The <b>varix</b> is a {{thickened}} axial ridge, a subcylindrical protrusion, in {{the shell}} which exists in some families of marine gastropods. It is an important shell character in generic classification. A <b>varix</b> is located at intervals around the whorl, and is formed by considerable thickening of the outer lip during a resting stage {{in the growth of}} the shell. In other words, in gastropods whose shells have varices, the shells are characterised by episodic growth - the shell grows in spurts, and during the resting phase the <b>varix</b> forms.|$|E
