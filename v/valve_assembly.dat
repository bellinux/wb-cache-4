"A team of investigators, {{led by the}} Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and {{including}} representatives from the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), Boeing and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) examined the aircraft {{on the ground in}} Manila. From that work, it was evident that the oxygen cylinder (number-4 in a bank along {{the right side of the}} forward cargo hold) had burst in such a way as to rupture the adjacent fuselage wall and be propelled upwards; puncturing the cabin floor and impacting the frame and handle of the R2 door and the overhead cabin panelling. No part of the cylinder (other than the <b>valve</b> <b>assembly)</b> was recovered and it was presumed lost from the aircraft during the depressurisation." ...|$|E

The motion of the rotary sealing element during actuation provides axial engagement of the rotary sealing element with a stationary valve plate which also has ports. Fluid passages are created through the valve when the ports of the rotary sealing element are aligned with the ports of the stationary valve plate. Alignment is achieved through rotation of the rotary sealing element {{with respect to the}} stationary valve plate. The fluid passages provide direct paths which minimize fluid turbulence created in the fluid as it passes through the valve...|$|R
50|$|For {{high speed}} and high power machines, {{a loss of}} {{lubricant}} can result in rapid bearing heating and damage due to friction. Also in dirty environments the oil can become contaminated with dust or debris that increases friction. In these applications, a fresh supply of lubricant can be continuously supplied to the bearing and all other contact surfaces, and the excess can be collected for filtration, cooling, and possibly reuse. Pressure oiling is commonly used in large and complex internal combustion engines {{in parts of the}} engine where directly splashed oil cannot reach, such as up into overhead <b>valve</b> <b>assemblies.</b> High speed turbochargers also typically require a pressurized oil system to cool the bearings and keep them from burning up due to the heat from the turbine.|$|R

50|$|T-Stoff: High test {{peroxide}} equipment {{consists of}} a pipe which runs along the starboard beam of the lifting frame from the trunnion end to the halfway point. The pipe is fitted at the upper end to the triple <b>valve</b> <b>assembly,</b> consisting of two flow valves and a three-way valve. The triple <b>valve</b> <b>assembly</b> connects to two tanks, a large measuring tank and a smaller overflow tank. The measuring tank can be filled to the rocket's required amount of T-stoff, after which any excess flows down a stand pipe to the overflow tank. The measuring tank is fitted with a ventilation stud, which vents displaced air as the tank is filled. The ventilation stud includes a ball cock fixed to a frustum stopper, which blocks the vent stud in case of accidental overfilling so that T-Stoff does not spray from the air vent. Both T-Stoff tanks are fitted with an inspection window.|$|E
5000|$|A {{pressure}} relief valve (often known as a [...] "pop-up valve") is typically included in pediatric versions and some adult versions, the purpose {{of which is to}} prevent accidental over-pressurization of the lungs.

40|$|An {{advanced}} design of an all metal, fast response, bipropellant, shut-off valve {{for use on}} long duration space missions is reported. The valve provides the flow control capability for a 1, 000 lb thrust, bipropellant engine using oxygen difluoride and diborane as propellants. The shutoff seal selection is a soft-on-hard metal concept. The soft seal is a spherical shell that seats against a hard conical seat. Beryllium copper and beryllium nickel seals were selected to seal against an electrolyzed Inconel 718 seat. Poppet shaft sealing is achieved by use of hydroformed, Inconel 718 bellows. Two <b>valve</b> <b>assemblies</b> were fabricated and subjected {{to a series of}} tests including leak, response time, flow capacity, dry cycles, water cycles, liquid nitrogen cycles, liquid fluorine cycles, and lead-lag operation cycles. These tests demonstrated the ability of the valve to meet design goals...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} on hydraulic systems has mainly focused on energy saving. This {{is because the}} efficiency of hydraulic systems is very low {{even though they have}} large power-to-size ratios. In mobile hydraulic equipment, conventional hydraulic spool valves with pressure compensators have already been replaced by <b>valve</b> <b>assemblies</b> with four-valve independent metering with electronically controlled pressure compensation. The independent metering concept and microprocessor control have much more potential to save more energy than conventional proportional valve control because of the increased controllability of the system. The primary focus {{of this study is to}} reduce the number of Independent Metering Valves (IMV) by introducing one directional control valve. This new model offers two degrees of freedom, i. e., controlling velocity and pressure, just as in conventional IMVs. In the system described here, two of the three independent valves are active during metering. In this paper, the theory behind a new method of flow control based upon load feedback is presented for two of the five distinct metering modes, and its performance is investigated and compared to that of a conventional IMV configuration...|$|R
50|$|The {{double check}} <b>valve</b> <b>assembly</b> is {{suitable}} for prevention of back pressure and back siphonage, but is not suitable for high hazard applications. It is commonly used on lawn irrigation, fire sprinkler and combi-boiler systems. If the hazard is higher, even a relatively low hazard such as using antifreeze in the fire sprinkler system, then a more reliable check valve such as a reduced pressure zone device may be mandated.|$|E
50|$|The bolt and <b>valve</b> <b>assembly</b> is the {{mechanism}} which fires the marker. The valve is a mechanical switch that controls {{whether or not}} the marker is firing. The bolt directs the flow of air and controls the entry of paintballs into the chamber. The bolt and valve may be separate components, as in many blowback and poppet-based electromagnetic markers. Alternatively, the valve may be built into the bolt, as in spool-valve electromagnetic markers.|$|E

This style of trumpet was first developed by the Henri Selmer Paris company in 1933 for Louis Armstrong, and was also famously used by Harry James, who preferred the configuration because of his long arms. Similar trumpets were also made by F. E. Olds (the Olds Recording Model) beginning in 1950 and King Musical Instruments, with the last instruments of this type being manufactured in the early 1970s.|$|E
