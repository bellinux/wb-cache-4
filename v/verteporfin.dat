50|$|In the 1990s, {{through a}} series of {{preclinical}} and clinical studies, Drs. Joan Miller, Evangelos Gragoudas, and colleagues at Mass. Eye and Ear and Mass General Hospital (in collaboration with QLT PhotoTherapeutics Inc. and Novartis) developed photodynamic therapy (PDT) with <b>verteporfin</b> (Visudyne®). <b>Verteporfin,</b> a light-sensitive dye, is injected systemically, and a laser specifically activates the drug in the choroidal vessels, blocking vessel leakage and preventing further vessel growth. On April 12, 2000, <b>verteporfin</b> became the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating AMD.|$|E
50|$|<b>Verteporfin</b> {{is given}} intravenously, 15 minutes before laser treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Verteporfin</b> is {{also used}} off-label for the {{treatment}} of central serous retinopathy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Verteporfin</b> has no {{influence}} on the liver enzyme CYP3A4, which metabolises many pharmaceutical drugs.|$|E

50|$|Another study {{published}} in the January 2009 issue of Ophthalmology provides the evidence for the efficacy of ranibizumab. Brown, et al. reported that monthly intravitreal injection of ranibizumab led to significant increase in the level of mean visual acuity compared to that of photodynamic therapy with <b>verteporfin.</b> It was concluded from the two year, phase III study that ranibizumab was superior to photodynamic therapy with <b>verteporfin</b> in the treatment of predominantly classic (PC) Wet AMD with low rates of ocular adverse effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Verteporfin</b> {{was shown}} to target the neovasculature {{resulting}} from macular degeneration in the macula within the first thirty minutes after intravenous administration of the drug.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, David Dolphin, Julia Levy {{and colleagues}} {{developed}} a novel photosensitizer, <b>verteporfin.</b> <b>Verteporfin,</b> a porphyrin derivative, is activated at 690 nm, {{a much longer}} wavelength than Photofrin. It has the property of preferential uptake by neovasculature. It has been widely tested for its use in treating skin cancers and received FDA approval in 2000 {{for the treatment of}} wet age related macular degeneration. As such it was the first medical treatment ever approved for this condition, which is a major cause of vision loss.|$|E
50|$|<b>Verteporfin</b> (trade name Visudyne), a benzoporphyrin derivative, is a {{medication}} {{used as a}} photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy to eliminate the abnormal {{blood vessels in the}} eye associated with conditions such as the wet form of macular degeneration. <b>Verteporfin</b> accumulates in these abnormal blood vessels and, when stimulated by nonthermal red light with a wavelength of 689 nm in the presence of oxygen, produces highly reactive short-lived singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen radicals, resulting in local damage to the endothelium and blockage of the vessels.|$|E
50|$|As cited above, <b>verteporfin</b> {{was widely}} {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of wet AMD beginning in 1999. The drug targets the neovasculature that is caused by the condition.|$|E
50|$|Most {{common side}} effects are blurred vision, headache, and local effects at the {{injection}} site. Also, photosensitivity; it is advised to avoid exposure to sunlight and unscreened lighting until 48 {{hours after the}} injection of <b>verteporfin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Verteporfin</b> {{has further}} {{advantages}} {{over the first}} generation sensitiser Photofrin. It is rapidly absorbed by the tumour (optimal tumour-normal tissue ratio 30-150 minutes post-intravenous injection) and is rapidly cleared from the body, minimising patient photosensitivity (1-2 days).|$|E
5000|$|Photofrin had the {{disadvantages}} of prolonged patient photosensitivity and a weak long-wavelength absorption (630 nm). This {{led to the}} development of second generation photosensitisers, including <b>Verteporfin</b> (a benzoporphyrin derivative, also known as Visudyne) and more recently, third generation targetable photosensitisers, such as antibody-directed photosensitisers.|$|E
50|$|CNV {{may also}} be treated with {{photodynamic}} therapy coupled with a photosensitive drug such as <b>verteporfin</b> (Visudyne). The drug is given intravenously. It is then activated in the eye by a laser light. The drug destroys the new blood vessels, and prevents any new vessels forming by forming thrombi.|$|E
50|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with <b>verteporfin</b> {{has shown}} promise as an {{effective}} treatment with minimal complications. Follow up studies have confirmed the treatment's long-term effectiveness including its effectiveness for the chronic variant of the disease.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of photodynamic effect (PDE) for Photofrin II (PfII), <b>Verteporfin,</b> and Merocyanine 540 (MC 540) was compared against neoplastic cells.

PfII triplet lifetime was two times longer than that of <b>Verteporfin,</b> however, its singlet molecular oxygen quantum yield was two times lower in comparison with <b>Verteporfin.</b> High singlet molecular oxygen quantum yield of <b>Verteporfin</b> resulted in high biological efficacy. To achieve 50 % mortality of cells four times lower light dose and five times lower concentration of <b>Verteporfin</b> were applied in comparison with PfII. The same level of cell damage was reached using 10 times higher light dose and two times higher concentration of MC 540 in comparison with PfII.

40|$|PURPOSE: The authors {{report on}} the {{therapeutic}} effect of intravenous diclofenac on <b>verteporfin</b> associated low back pain (LBP), {{which is the most}} frequent adverse effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for macular degeneration. METHODS: The authors studied 818 patients who received PDT with <b>verteporfin</b> for choroidal neovascularization. Systemic blood pressures were recorded in all study participants half an hour before PDT treatment. All patients who experienced LBP during <b>verteporfin</b> infusion were asked to grade their pain as mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), or unbearable (4). RESULTS: Thirty-three patients had LBP during their first <b>verteporfin</b> infusion. Of these, 11 subjects (1. 34 % of all) reported increased pain scores (level 2 to 4) and received intravenous diclofenac ahead of their next PDT. Patients with LBP during <b>verteporfin</b> infusion had significantly higher systolic blood pressures than uncomplicated cases (180 mmHg vs 155 mmHg, p= 0. 01). Treatment with intravenous diclofenac short before PDT significantly reduced the patients' mean pain score by 1. 8 levels (p= 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, intravenous application of diclofenac short before <b>verteporfin</b> infusion effectively prevented <b>verteporfin</b> associated LBP in patients with systemic hypertension...|$|E
40|$|Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP 1) is a {{transcriptional}} coactivator in the Hippo signaling pathway. Increased YAP 1 activity {{promotes the}} growth of tumors, including that of colorectal cancer (CRC). <b>Verteporfin,</b> a drug that enhances phototherapy to treat neovascular macular degeneration, is an inhibitor of YAP 1. We found that <b>verteporfin</b> inhibited tumor growth independently of its effects on YAP 1 or the related protein TAZ in genetically or chemically induced mouse models of CRC, in patient-derived xenografts, and in enteroid models of CRC. Instead, <b>verteporfin</b> exhibited in vivo selectivity for killing tumor cells in part by impairing the global clearance of high-molecular weight oligomerized proteins, particularly p 62 (a sequestrome involved in autophagy) and STAT 3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; a transcription factor). <b>Verteporfin</b> inhibited cytokine-induced STAT 3 activity and cell proliferation and reduced the viability of cultured CRC cells. Although <b>verteporfin</b> accumulated {{to a greater extent}} in normal cells than in tumor cells in vivo, experiments with cultured cells indicated that the normal cells efficiently cleared verteporfin-induced protein oligomers through autophagic and proteasomal pathways. Culturing CRC cells under hypoxic or nutrient-deprived conditions (modeling a typical CRC microenvironment) impaired the clearance of protein oligomers and resulted in cell death, whereas culturing cells under normoxic or glucose-replete conditions protected cell viability and proliferation in the presence of <b>verteporfin.</b> Furthermore, <b>verteporfin</b> suppressed the proliferation of other cancer cell lines {{even in the absence of}} YAP 1, suggesting that <b>verteporfin</b> may be effective against multiple types of solid cancers...|$|E
40|$|Autophagy is a {{cellular}} catabolic process {{responsible for the}} degradation of cytoplasmic constituents, including organelles and long-lived proteins, that helps maintain cellular homeostasis and protect against various cellular stresses. <b>Verteporfin</b> is a benzoporphyrin derivative used clinically in photodynamic therapy to treat macular degeneration. <b>Verteporfin</b> was recently found to inhibit autophagosome formation by an unknown mechanism that does not require exposure to light. We report that <b>verteporfin</b> directly targets and modifies p 62, a scaffold and adaptor protein that binds both polyubiquitinated proteins destined for degradation and LC 3 on autophagosomal membranes. Western blotting experiments revealed that exposure of cells or purified p 62 to <b>verteporfin</b> causes the formation of covalently crosslinked p 62 oligomers by a mechanism involving low-level singlet oxygen production. Rose bengal, a singlet oxygen producer structurally unrelated to <b>verteporfin,</b> also produced crosslinked p 62 oligomers and inhibited autophagosome formation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} <b>verteporfin</b> and same-day ranibizumab on retina, choroid, vasculature, choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) {{and visual}} function. METHODS: Eleven patients with occult or predominantly classic subfoveal CNV secondary to age-related macular degeneration received <b>verteporfin</b> and four monthly intravitreal ranibizumab injections. Eyes were examined using fluorescein angiography (FA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT), visual acuity (VA) and microperimetry. RESULTS: Over 9 months, seven patients gained three to 24 letters and one had unchanged VA. Three patients lost eight to 24 letters due to recurrence and received another <b>verteporfin</b> treatment at month 6. Median retinal sensitivity of the central 4 degrees of the macula increased from 0. 9 (SD 2. 3) dB (baseline) to 5. 2 (1. 8) dB (only baseline <b>verteporfin)</b> and 4. 1 (4. 5) dB (second <b>verteporfin</b> treatment) at study end. OCT showed sub- and intraretinal leakage increased with <b>verteporfin,</b> but resolved after 2 weeks. After combination treatment, CNV was completely occluded on FA within 1 week. ICGA showed non-perfusion of small/medium choroidal vessels. Recovery of choroidal perfusion began after 1 month, but remained impaired throughout follow-up. CONCLUSION: Verteporfin/ranibizumab was associated with CNV occlusion, reduced oedema, improved visual function and retinal sensitivity.

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} best {{corrected}} visual acuity (BCVA) between <b>Verteporfin</b> with photodynamic therapy (PDT) and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) {{in patients with}} myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV). METHOD: Published literature from Medline, Premedline, Embase and the Cochrane Library from inception until November 2013 were retrieved. All studies evaluating the BCVA between <b>Verteporfin</b> with PDT and intravitreal anti-VEGF for myopic CNV were included. The results were pooled using mean difference (MD), a corresponding 95 % confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Finally, five studies enrolled 349 eyes {{were included in the}} meta-analysis. We inferred that the BCVA of myopic CNV after the treatment of anti-VEGF was significantly better compared with <b>Verteporfin</b> with PDT (MD= 0. 25, 95 ％CI: 0. 17 - 0. 33, Z = 5. 97, P < 0. 00001).

Methods: In this prospective, non-comparative, interventional case series, 14 eyes of 14 patients with chronic CSC who received half-dose <b>verteporfin</b> PDT were examined. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), macular sensitivity in the central 4, 8, and 12 degrees, and fixation stability were evaluated at baseline and at months 1, 3, 6, and 12 after half-dose <b>verteporfin</b> PDT. Macular sensitivity and fixation stability were determined by MP- 1 microperimetry. Results: Mean retinal sensitivity in the central 4 and 8 degrees was significantly better at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after half-dose <b>verteporfin</b> PDT than at baseline. BCVA was significantly better after half-dose <b>verteporfin</b> PDT but only after 3 months. Fixation was relatively unstable in three eyes at baseline, but became stable at 12 months.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} short-term {{safety and}} the effects on visual acuity and fluorescein angiography of single or multiple sessions of photodynamic therapy with <b>verteporfin</b> for choroidal neovascularization (CNV) not related to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), including pathologic myopia, the ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, angioid streaks, and idiopathic causes. DESIGN: A nonrandomized, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation phase 1 and 2 clinical trial. SETTING: Four ophthalmic centers in Europe and North America providing retinal care. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen patients with subfoveal CNV due to pathologic myopia, the ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, angioid streaks, or idiopathic causes. METHODS: Standardized protocol refraction, visual acuity testing, ophthalmic examinations, color photographs, and fluorescein angiograms were {{used to evaluate the}} results of photodynamic therapy treatments with <b>verteporfin.</b> Follow-up ranged from 12 weeks for patients who were treated once to 43 weeks for patients who were treated up to 4 times. RESULTS: <b>Verteporfin</b> therapy was well tolerated in patients with CNV not related to AMD. No deterioration in visual acuity was observed; most patients gained at least 1 line of vision. Reduction in the size of leakage area from classic CNV was noted in all patients as early as 1 week after <b>verteporfin</b> therapy, with complete absence of leakage from classic CNV in almost half of the patients. Improvement in visual acuity after <b>verteporfin</b> therapy was greatest (+ 6, + 8, and + 9 lines) in 3 patients with relatively poor initial visual acuity (between 20 / 200 and 20 / 800). Up to 4 treatments were found to have short-term safety even with retreatment intervals as short as 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of CNV not related to AMD with <b>verteporfin</b> therapy achieves short-term cessation of fluorescein leakage from CNV in a small number of patients without loss of vision. Further randomized clinical trials including a larger number of patients are under way to confirm whether <b>verteporfin</b> therapy is beneficial for subfoveal CNV not related to AMD...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{compared}} ranibizumab [...] a recombinant, humanized, {{monoclonal antibody}} Fab that neutralizes all active forms of vascular endothelial growth factor A [...] with photodynamic therapy with <b>verteporfin</b> {{in the treatment}} of predominantly classic neovascular age-related macular degeneration. METHODS: During the first year of this 2 -year, multicenter, double-blind study, we randomly assigned patients in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio to receive monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (0. 3 mg or 0. 5 mg) plus sham <b>verteporfin</b> therapy or monthly sham injections plus active <b>verteporfin</b> therapy. The primary end point was the proportion of patients losing fewer than 15 letters from baseline visual acuity at 12 months. RESULTS: Of the 423 patients enrolled, 94. 3 % of those given 0. 3 mg of ranibizumab and 96. 4 % of those given 0. 5 mg lost fewer than 15 letters, as compared with 64. 3 % of those in the <b>verteporfin</b> group (P< 0. 001 for each comparison). Visual acuity improved by 15 letters or more in 35. 7 % of the 0. 3 -mg group and 40. 3 % of the 0. 5 -mg group, as compared with 5. 6 % of the <b>verteporfin</b> group (P< 0. 001 for each comparison). Mean visual acuity increased by 8. 5 letters in the 0. 3 -mg group and 11. 3 letters in the 0. 5 -mg group, as compared with a decrease of 9. 5 letters in the <b>verteporfin</b> group (P< 0. 001 for each comparison). Among 140 patients treated with 0. 5 mg of ranibizumab, presumed endophthalmitis occurred in 2 patients (1. 4 %) and serious uveitis in 1 (0. 7 %). CONCLUSIONS: Ranibizumab was superior to <b>verteporfin</b> as intravitreal treatment of predominantly classic neovascular age-related macular degeneration, with low rates of serious ocular adverse events. Treatment improved visual acuity on average at 1 year. (ClinicalTrials. gov number, NCT 00061594 [ClinicalTrials. gov].) ...|$|E
40|$|Autophagy enables {{cells to}} degrade and recycle cytoplasmic {{materials}} {{both as a}} housekeeping mechanism {{and in response to}} extracellular stress such as nutrient deprivation. Recent studies indicate that autophagy also functions as a protective mechanism in response to several cancer therapy agents, making it a prospective therapeutic target. Few pharmacological inhibitors suitable for testing the therapeutic potential of autophagy inhibition in vivo are known. An automated microscopy assay was used to screen > 3, 500 drugs and pharmacological agents and identified one drug, <b>verteporfin,</b> as an inhibitor of autophagosome accumulation. <b>Verteporfin</b> is a benzoporphyrin derivative used in photodynamic therapy, but it inhibits autophagy without light activation. <b>Verteporfin</b> did not inhibit LC 3 /Atg 8 processing or membrane recruitment in response to autophagic stimuli, but it inhibited drug- and starvation-induced autophagic degradation and the sequestration of cytoplasmic materials into autophagosomes. Transient exposure to <b>verteporfin</b> in starvation conditions reduced cell viability whereas cells in nutrient-rich medium were unaffected by drug treatment. Analysis of structural analogs indicated that the activity of <b>verteporfin</b> requires the presence of a substituted cyclohexadiene at ring A of the porphyrin core but that it can tolerate a number of large substituents at rings C and D.
