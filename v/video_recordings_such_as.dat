The show featured three never before seen sequences of Nu Pogodi! of approximate 10 min. length and were not re-released for home entertainment in spite of various full episode collections. They can, however, be seen on television on some channels during children cartoons time and are viewable through web <b>video</b> <b>recordings</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> YouTube).|$|E
40|$|Real-world {{environment}} introduces many variations into <b>video</b> <b>recordings</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> changing illumination {{and object}} dynamics. In this paper, a technique for abstracting useful spatio-temporal features from graph-based segmentation operations has been proposed. A spatio-temporal volume (STV) -based shape matching algorithm is then devised {{by using the}} intersection theory to facilitate the definition and detection of video events. To maintain system efficiency, this research has integrated an innovative feature-weight evaluation mechanism which “rewards” or “punishes” recognition outputs based on the segmentation quality. Substantial improvements on both the event “Precision” and “Recall” rate and the processing efficiency have been observed in the experiments in the project...|$|E

WITNESS is a human rights non-profitorganization and its mission is to partner with on-the-ground organizations to support the documentation of human rights violations and their consequences, {{in order to further}} public engagement, policy change, and justice. They rely on <b>video</b> <b>recordings</b> using technology <b>such</b> <b>as</b> handheld camcorders and smartphones to capture the world's attention and viscerally communicate human rights abuses. They have documented human rights abuses from the police in the favelas of Brazil, children soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, human trafficking in Brazil and the United States, and many other human rights issues, all through the use of alternative media.|$|R
40|$|Retrieving {{information}} from the ever-increasing amount of unannotated audio and <b>video</b> <b>recordings</b> requires techniques <b>such</b> <b>as</b> unsupervised pattern discovery or query-by-example. In this paper we focus on queries that are specified {{in the form of}} an audio snippet containing the desired word or expression excised from the target recordings. The task is to retrieve all-and-only the instances whose match score with the query meet an absolute criterion. For this purpose we introduce a distance measure between two acoustic vectors that can be calibrated in a completely unsupervised manner. The use of that measure also allows the use of a fast matching approach, which makes it possible to skip more than 97 % of full-fledged DTW with-out affecting performance in terms of precision and recall. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposals with query-by-example experiments conducted on a read speech corpus for English and a spontaneous speech corpus for Dutch...|$|R
40|$|Creating <b>video</b> <b>recordings</b> {{of events}} <b>such</b> <b>as</b> lectures or {{meetings}} is increasingly inexpensive and easy. However, reviewing {{the content of}} such video may be time-consuming and difficult. Our goal is to produce a “comic book ” summary, in which a transcript is augmented with keyframes that disambiguate and clarify accompanying text. Unlike most previous keyframe extraction systems which rely primarily on visual cues, we present a linguistically-motivated approach that selects keyframes that contain salient gestures. Rather than learning gesture salience directly, it is estimated by measuring the contribution of gesture to understanding other discourse phenomena. More specifically, we bootstrap from multimodal coreference resolution to identify gestures that improve performance. We then select keyframes that capture these gestures. Our model predicts gesture salience as a hidden variable in a conditional framework, with observable features from both the visual and textual modalities. This approach significantly outperforms competitive baselines that do not use gesture information...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, 1992 The {{purpose of}} this naturalistic case study was to {{investigate}} conditions under which first year Bachelor of Education students develop and extend their reflective and metacognitive thinking. More specifically, it sought to explore the extent to which: involvement in reflective activities affects metacognitive thinking; the development of metacognitive thinking influences motivation; and participation in group work affects students' reflective thinking practices. The researcher, as participant observer, included individual reflective and group work as integral processes in the subject taught to the first year research group. The research produced a large mass of data including transcripts of audio and <b>video</b> <b>recordings,</b> work samples <b>such</b> <b>as</b> concept maps and journals, and the researcher's observational notes. Findings of the study indicate that reflection and metacognition can be valuable for personal and professional growth of both teachers and students.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of multimodal data comprised of images, <b>videos</b> and additional <b>recordings,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> gaze trajectories, EEG, emotional states, {{and heart rate}} is presently only feasible with custom applications. Even exploring such data requires compilation of specific applications that suit a specific dataset only. This need for specific applications arises since all corresponding data are stored in separate files in custom-made distinct data formats. Thus accessing such datasets is cumbersome and time-consuming for experts and virtually impossible for non-experts. To make multimodal research data easily shareable and accessible to a broad audience, like researchers from diverse disciplines and all other interested people, we show how multimedia containers can support the visualization and sonification of scientific data. The use of a container format allows explorative multimodal data analyses with any multimedia player as well as streaming the data via the Internet. We prototyped this approach on two datasets, both with visualization of gaze data and one with additional sonification of EEG data. In a user study, we asked expert and non-expert users about their experience during an explorative investigation of the data. Based on their statements, our prototype implementation, and the datasets, we discuss the benefit of storing multimodal data, including the corresponding videos or images, in a single multimedia container. In conclusion, we summarize what is necessary for having multimedia containers as a standard for storing multimodal data and give an outlook on how artificial networks can be trained on such standardized containers...|$|R
40|$|Classroom {{management}} (CM) can {{be viewed}} as a system of strategies employed by a teacher to influence the physical and social space of the classroom to foster an environment where learning can occur (Christofferson, Sullivan, & Bradley, 2015). Classroom management skills are crucial for teachers to create classroom settings where students can learn as effective CM leads to student high achievement (Stronge, Ward, & Grant, 2011) and contributes to teacher remaining in the profession. The first years of teaching are usually reported to be the most challenging. The aim of the research is to describe in detail CMS of student teachers (pre-service teachers) on their long term teaching practice in lower secondary classes. The research is based on an integrated mixed methods design (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011). The main, qualitative part of the research is designed as field research based on ethnographic research design. Its aim is to describe conceptions (via interviews and reflective teaching diaries) and use (via observation with <b>video</b> <b>recordings</b> and its transcription) of CMS of student teachers. The quantitative part of the research includes (a) examination of quantitative parameters gathered via <b>video</b> <b>recordings</b> of lessons <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the types of CMS, behaviour alteration messages and techniques, discipline mechanisms, instructional techniques, student negotiation techniques and (b) statistical analyses of survey data regarding CMS and individual characteristics of student teachers <b>such</b> <b>as</b> a the need for (cognitive) closure. CMS were measured by adapted Behavior and Instructional Management Scale – BIMS (Martin & Sass, 2010) and need for cognitive closure by adapted Need for (Cognitive) Closure Scale – NFCS (Roets & Van Hiel, 2011). NFCS consists of 15 items with 6 -point Likert type ratings measuring 5 sub-scales: desire for predictability, preference of order and structure, discomfort with ambiguity, decisiveness, and close-mindedness.
