40|$|The {{approximate}} temporal coincidence {{between the}} five major extinc-tion events {{over the past}} 542 million years and the eruption of large ig-neous provinces (LIPs) has led to speculation that environmental perturbations generated by the emplacement of large volumes of magma and associated outgassing over {{short periods of time}} triggered each global biologic crisis (1). Establishing an exact link between extinctions and LIP eruptions has proved difficult because of the geographic separa-tion between LIP volcanic deposits and stratigraphic sequences preserv-ing evidence of the extinction. In most cases, uncertainties on radioisotopic dates used to correlate between geographically separated study areas exceed the duration of both the extinction interval and LIP volcanism by an order of magnitude. This hinders evaluation of any relationship between magmatism and extinction and precludes accurate estimates of <b>volcanic</b> <b>effusion</b> rates, associated volatile release, and ex-tinction mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of the European Space Agency (ESA) is to improve knowledge of physical properties and geodynamic processes of the lithosphere and the Earth’s deep interior, and their relationship to the Earth-surface changes. PERLA project {{is a part of the}} challenge of ESA’s Living Planet program to investigate the Solid Earth, and in particular the lithosphere of the Paraná-Etendeka Large Igneous Province (LIP). At the present stage the study is focusing on the upper mantle, the source of the magma. The aim is to motivate the asymmetry of the shallow <b>volcanic</b> <b>effusion</b> of the Early Cretaceous tholeiitic magmatism, that in Paraná is wide, thick and represented by the basaltic layer of Serra Geral Formation, while in Etendeka it is rare and spanned. Viceversa the alkaline magmatism shows similar effusions along the region with dyke swarms and associated alkaline and alkaline-carbonatite complexes from Early Creataceous to Paleogene age. ESA’s Living Planet program offers a suite of scientific satellites, the Earth Explorers, and in this context PERLA adopts the newest GOCE satellite mission products. The Marussi tensor field and especially its vertical component show a positive anomaly along the coastline sector of both the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean. Positive anomalies are also related to the deeper Moho under the northern part of Paraná basin, in South America (SAM) and the Etendeka continental part. Here we aim to define the detail of masses between crust and upper mantle by modeling the Marussi Tensor components and the invariants. The invariants are easier to understand because they are independent of the reference system. The forward model uses Tesseroids. The density model is compared with recent seismologic models, and is performed according to the results provided by the physical laws governing rock densities and seismic velocity of lithosphere in function of temperature and pressure combined with laboratory measurements of a great number of mineral samples. Also the age of the mantle is included, according to the standard petrological classification of mantle with the percentages of four lead minerals: Olivine, Orthopyroxene, Clinopyroxene and Garnet. Studying the GOCE gravimetric data with the integration of geophysical and also petrological constraints is useful to investigate the lithosphere and to improve the geodynamics of complex geologic areas like LIPs...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe European and Corsica-Sardinia {{margins of}} the Ligurian Sea (western Mediterranean) have been {{affected}} by a geochemically diverse igneous activity, offshore and onshore, since the Eocene. This magmatism occurred in a global subduction-related framework. On the European side, the oldest Tertiary magmatism dated at ca. 35 Ma was mainly calc-alkaline. It included the emplacement of plutonic bodies of adakitic affinity, such as the quartz microdiorite laccolith locally referred to as "esterellite". Younger magmatic events on-land within the whole Ligurian domain were mostly medium-K or K-rich calc-alkaline. Miocene volcanic activity was important in Sardinia, where andesites and ignimbrites were erupted during several magmatic cycles. In Corsica, it was minor although it emplaced lamprophyres near Sisco at 15 Ma. Dredging and diving cruises conducted in the Ligurian Sea during the last thirty years allowed us to collect a number of submarine samples. We discuss here their geochemistry (major and trace elements) and their whole-rock K-Ar ages and mineral 40 Ar- 39 Ar plateau ages. Around 15 Ma, minor amounts of adakitic lavas were emplaced off southwestern Corsica, in the deepest part of the Liguria-Corsica Basin. They rested over the thinnest southwestern Corsica Hercynian continental crust. Closer to the coast, contemporaneous calc-alkaline rocks erupted on a less thinned crust. The adakitic events could be indicative of either the final stages of active subduction, or alternatively of a slab tearing linked to the southeastern retreat and steepening of the slab. The latter event could be connected {{with the end of the}} Corsica-Sardinia block drifting and its correlative eastern collision. Younger <b>volcanic</b> <b>effusions,</b> dated at 14 - 6 Ma, occurred mostly northwest and north of Corsica. K-rich calc-alkaline basalts, shoshonites and K-rich trachytes were emplaced during this period, and alkali basalts erupted as early as 12 Ma in Sardinia. In the Toulon area, alkali basalts dated at 7 - 6 Ma represent the last onshore activity just before the Messinian crisis, and the Pliocene alkali basaltic outpouring in Sardinia. We propose to link these latter volcanic events to the development of a slab window in a post-collisional tectonic framework...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 The Toba Caldera Complex is the {{youngest}} resurgent caldera in the last 100 kyrs, formed from four overlapping eruptions starting 1. 2 Myrs ago. The last caldera-forming eruption, the Youngest Toba Tuff eruption, occurred ~ 74 kyrs ago, emitting 2800 km 3 of ash and pumice into the atmosphere and forming the caldera outline seen today. The amount of ejecta released into the atmosphere potentially affected the global climate and regional human evolution. The youth of this caldera system has made it the perfect natural laboratory for investigating resurgence, the last stage in the caldera cycle, associated with <b>volcanic</b> <b>effusions</b> and structural deformation and uplift. Organic-rich sediments found on the uplifted caldera floor provide a well-preserved and detailed history of the resurgent uplift, while lava extrusions along faults running through and around the caldera provide geological context for the initiation of resurgent activity at Toba Caldera. New data reveal details of the post-caldera history at the Earth’s youngest resurgent supervolcano, Toba caldera in Sumatra. Resurgence after the caldera-forming ∼ 74 kyrs ago Youngest Toba Tuff eruption uplifted the caldera floor as a resurgent dome, Samosir Island, capped with 100 m of lake sediments. 14 C age data from the uppermost datable sediments reveal that Samosir Island was submerged beneath lake level (∼ 900 m a. s. l) at 33 kyrs ago. Since then, Samosir experienced 700 m of uplift as a tilted block dipping to the west. 14 C ages and elevations of sediment along a transect of Samosir reveal that minimum uplift rates were ∼ 5. 6 cm/year from ∼ 33. 7 to 22. 5 kyrs ago, but diminished to ∼ 0. 7 cm/year after 22. 5 kyrs ago.  Localised uplift activity continued along the eastern coast of Samosir associated with <b>volcanic</b> <b>effusions,</b> with 14 C ages of sediments found blanketing lava domes as young as ~ 2. 7 kyrs ago, producing localized uplift rates of ~ 1. 9 cm/yr. Zircon U-Th crystallization and (U-Th) /He ages reveal resurgence commenced at 69. 7 ± 4. 5 kyrs ago progressing westward across the caldera, as reflected by post-caldera effusive lava eruptions and uplifted lake sediment. Previous geochronology for four of these lava dome localities (North Samosir, Tuk Tuk Samosir, North Pardepur, South Pardepur) by combined U-Th-disequilibrium/(U-Th) /He zircon geochronology yielded eruption ages ranging from 69. 7 ± 4. 5 kyrs ago to 56. 9 ± 3. 9 kyrs ago, implying resurgent volcanic activity started almost immediately after the climactic eruption and continued for ~ 20, 000 years. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages from sanidine and plagioclase feldspar crystals from the same lava domes have returned ages that are contemporaneous with the climactic eruption, between 74. 3 ± 0. 4 and 71. 4 ± 8. 2 kyrs ago for North Samosir, Tuk Tuk Samosir, and South Pardepur, with only North Pardepur showing a substantially younger 40 Ar/ 39 Ar crystallization age of 23. 6 ± 9. 8 kyrs ago. These ages overlap with the (U-Th) /He ages, but the younger error weighted average (U-Th) /He eruption ages imply {{that the process of}} resurgence is more complex. Using eruption temperatures and a simple argon diffusion model, the difference between the weighted mean (U-Th) /He age and stacked plateau 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages can be explained by a difference in closure temperatures between argon and helium. Sanidine and plagioclase feldspar crystals from three lava domes record the YTT eruption age and are interpreted to be antecrysts that remained in the remnant magma system below argon closure temperature (Tc) in sanidine/plagioclase (350 °C). In contrast, the younger North Pardepur lava dome 40 Ar/ 39 Ar inverse isochron plagioclase age of 47. 9 ± 11. 1 kyrs ago overlaps with the (U-Th) /He age, implying that plagioclase crystals are either autocrysts, formed during the eruption of the North Pardepur dome, or YTT antecrysts that have been reset due to their host magma remaining above argon Tc for > 700 yrs. Matrix glass analyses represented on the quartz-albite-orthoclase (Qz-Ab-Or) ternary plot indicate that the Samosir dome magmas equilibrated over a deeper range of pressures (200 - 50 MPa) than the YTT (100 - 50 MPa), while the Pardepur dome magmas record the lowest pressures (50 - 0. 1 MPa). Fault and drainage analysis of the resurgent dome shows that the southern half of Samosir Island is much more dissected than the northern half of the island. Drainage basins in the south are much more developed, with very little sediment cover left and basement rock observed to be exposed in some areas. Using drainage basin analysis tools in ArcGIS and the Geomorph Tools program in Matlab, the stream networks were analysed and channel profiles were created. Combining the identified locations of knickpoints along these channel profiles with assumed erodibility paramters, the minimum amount of time needed for the drainage basins to develop was calculated. Based on these calculations, drainage basins in the north and south took {{the same amount of time}} to develop. This means that the difference in drainage development is a result of another factor. One possible explanation is that pre-existing faults may underlie the thick intracaldera YTT deposit on the southern half of Samosir. These faults may have been from the previous half of the OTT resurgent dome, Uluan, which Samosir has appeared to take the place of. Pre-existing faults could have resulted in areas of weakness that were exploited during drainage basin development, thus making the southern drainage basins develop faster than the northern drainage basins. A more detailed study is required, however, to fully develop this potential hypothesis. A major active stratovolcano north of Toba, Sinabung, shows strong geochemical kinship with Toba, through 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopes, whole rock chemistry, and 238 U- 230 Th disequilibrium ages of zircons from recent eruption products. This suggests that Toba’s climactic magma reservoir, which was tapped during resurgence, may extend beneath Sinabung and is being tapped during current Sinabung eruptions. This implies that resurgence at the Toba Caldera system may have continued as eruptions at Sinabung...|$|R
40|$|The {{prediction}} of lava flow advance and velocity is crucial during an effusive <b>volcanic</b> crisis. The <b>effusion</b> rate {{is a key}} control of lava dynamics, and proxies {{have been developed to}} estimate it in near real-time. The thermal proxy in predominant use links the satellite-measured thermal radiated power to the effusion rate. It lacks however a robust physical basis to allow time-dependent modeling. We investigate here through analogue experiments the coupling between the spreading of a solidifying flow and its surface thermal signal. We extract a first order behavior from experimental results obtained using polyethylene glycol (PEG) wax, that solidifies abruptly during cooling. We find that the flow advance is discontinuous, with relatively low supply rates yielding long stagnation phases and compound flows. Flows with higher supply rates are less sensitive to solidification and display a spreading behavior closer to that of purely viscous currents. The total power radiated from the upper surface also grows by stages, but the signal radiated by the hottest and liquid part of the flow reaches a quasi-steady state after some time. This plateau value scales around half of the theoretical {{prediction of}} a model developed previously for the spreading and cooling of isoviscous gravity currents. The corrected scaling yields satisfying estimates of the effusion rate from the total radiated power measured on a range of basaltic lava flows. We conclude that a gross estimate of the supply rate of solidifying flows can be retrieved from thermal remote-sensing, but the predictions of lava advance as a function of effusion rate appears a more difficult task due to chaotic emplacement of solidifying flows...|$|R
