Watson and other Bell engineers invented numerous other improvements to telephony. Bell succeeded where others failed to assemble a commercially viable telephone system. It can be argued that Bell invented {{the telephone}} industry. Bell's first intelligible <b>voice</b> <b>transmission</b> over an electric wire was named an IEEE Milestone.|$|E
500|$|Each Adcock range station {{had four}} [...] antenna towers erected on {{the corners of}} a 425× 425ft square, with an {{optional}} extra tower in the center for <b>voice</b> <b>transmission</b> and homing. The stations emitted directional electromagnetic radiation at 190 to 535 kHz and 1,500watts, into four quadrants. The radiation of one opposing quadrant pair was modulated (at an audio frequency of 1,020Hz) with a Morse code for the letter A (·—), and the other pair with the letter N (—·). The intersections between the quadrants defined four course lines emanating from the transmitting station, along four compass directions, where the A and N signals were of equal intensity, with their combined Morse codes merging into a steady 1,020Hz audio tone. These course lines (also called [...] "legs"), where only a tone could be heard, defined the airways.|$|E

5000|$|Phase 2 is what {{is known}} as 6.25 kHz [...] "bandwidth equivalent" [...] which {{satisfies}} an FCC requirement for <b>voice</b> <b>transmissions</b> to occupy less bandwidth. Voice traffic on a Phase 2 system transmits with the full 12.5 kHz per frequency allocation, as a Phase 1 system does, however it does so at a faster data rate of 12 kbit/s allowing two simultaneous <b>voice</b> <b>transmissions.</b> As such subscriber radios also transmit with the full 12.5 kHz, but in an on/off repeating fashion resulting in half the transmission and thus an equivalent of 6.25 kHz per each radio. This is accomplished using the AMBE voice coder that uses half the rate of the Phase 1 IMBE voice coders.|$|R
2500|$|During {{his summer}} {{vacation}} at the Homestead in 1874, Alexander Graham continued to contemplate electrical sound reproduction while viewing the undulating {{surface of the}} Grand River from his [...] "dreaming place". He postulated that [...] "it {{would be possible to}} transmit sounds of any sort" [...] by the continuous variation of the intensity of the electric current. [...] This method of sound energy to electrical signal transduction was fundamentally different from the on-or-off transmission methods used by other telephone experimenters. [...] Alexander Graham held lengthy discussions with his father explaining what he thought he could achieve with a sound-driven transmitter producing an electrical signal which would instantaneously travel an electrical circuit to a receiver at another location where it would be converted back to sound. His record of a discussion with his father in their home's living room, wrote [...] "If I could vary the intensity of the electric current in exact proportion to the variation of the air density in the production of words, I would be able to transmit speech by telegraph" [...] (using the telephone's technical analog, the telegraph, as the former name had not yet been adapted). On 26 July 1874 in their living room the younger Bell realized the technical principles of telephony, inventing the telecommunications device he is now closely identified with. Returning again to the Homestead the next summer in 1875 Bell wrote his first draft specifications of the telephone patent—commonly considered to be the most valuable patent in history—that September. He later built his first fully functional unit at Boston on 10 March 1876. Later that year, in August, Bell made the first successful <b>voice</b> <b>transmission</b> of any notable distance, between Brantford and Paris Ontario.|$|E
