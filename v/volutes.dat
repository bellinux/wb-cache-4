Experiments were carried out to obtain vibration signals at different flow rates of slope <b>volute</b> pump, which were compared with conventional spiral <b>volute</b> pump. Results show that vibration level is closely related to flow structure interior pump. At low flow rates, especially, vibration energy increases rapidly with the onset of rotating stall. Rotor-stator interaction mechanism changes when adopting slope <b>volute.</b> In slope <b>volute</b> pump, the peaks in power spectra correspond to different harmonics of fBPF at three measuring directions; however, in spiral <b>volute</b> pump, the predominant components always correspond to 2 fBPF.

A turbocharger, which reclaims the {{energy from the}} exhaust gas to boost the intake air, can effectively improve the power density of the engine thus {{is one of the}} key enablers to achieve the engine downsizing. Acknowledging its importance, many research efforts have gone into improving a turbocharger performance, which includes turbine <b>volute.</b> The cross-section design of a turbine <b>volute</b> in a turbocharger is usually a compromise between the engine level packaging and desired performance. Thus, it is beneficial to evaluate the effects of cross-sectional shape on a turbine performance. This paper presents experimental and computational investigation of the influence of <b>volute</b> cross-sectional shape on the performance of a radial turbocharger turbine under pulsating conditions. The cross-sectional shape of the baseline <b>volute</b> (denoted as <b>Volute</b> B) was optimized (<b>Volute</b> A) while the annulus distribution of area-to-radius ratio (A/R) for the two <b>volute</b> configurations are kept the same. Experimental results show that the turbine with the optimized <b>volute</b> A has better cycle averaged efficiency under pulsating flow conditions, for different loadings and frequencies. The advantage of performance is influenced by the operational conditions. After the experiment, a validated unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling was employed to investigate the mechanism by which performance differs between the baseline <b>volute</b> and the optimized version. Computational results show a stronger flow distortion in spanwise direction at the rotor inlet with the baseline <b>volute.</b> Furthermore, compared with the optimized <b>volute,</b> the flow distortion is more sensitive to the pulsating flow conditions in the baseline <b>volute.</b> This is due to the different secondary flow pattern in the cross-sections, hence demonstrating a direction for desired <b>volute</b> cross-sectional shape to be used in a turbocharger radial turbine for internal combustion engine...|$|R

40|$|Laser {{velocimetry}} {{measurements were}} taken in a double volute/single discharge centrifugal pump (0. 60 specific speed, 1583 US units) with symmetrical <b>volute</b> halves. Blade-to-blade radial and tangential velocity profiles at the impeller exit are presented and compared to data for a similar single <b>volute</b> pump. Flow rates ranged from 40 % of design flow to the design point. The blade-to-blade profiles were more uniform than for the single <b>volute</b> pump. Also, the average circumferential variations for the double <b>volute</b> pump were more symmetric than for the single <b>volute</b> pump. For the double <b>volute</b> geometry measurements indicate that radial inward flow (recirculation) was only present for flow rates below 60 % of design flow, compared to 80 % of design flow for the single <b>volute</b> pump. Velocity data was also used to determine <b>volute</b> losses, slip factor, and momentum contributions to the impeller radial forces. <b>Volute</b> losses were quantified and shown to increase for flow rates below 80 % of design flow and were approximately 10 % of the developed head at 40 % flow. The efficiency in the double <b>volute</b> compared to the single <b>volute</b> shows decreased performance for flows above 55 % of design flow, which is attributed to increased boundary layer friction; at low flow rates increased performance is ascribed to better control over the recirculation regions. Slip factors were symmetric around the <b>volute</b> but were lower than for a single <b>volute</b> pump. Finally, momentum contributions to the total impeller radial load were shown to be maximum at the design point, contributing 40 % of the force developed by the pressure distribution; the significance diminished at lower flow rates and the contribution was negligible at 40 % of the design flow...|$|R

A turbocharger increases charge air density using a turbine to extract waste energy from the exhaust gas to drive a compressor. Most turbocharger applications employ a radial inflow turbine.
