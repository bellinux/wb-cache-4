40|$|We {{describe}} symmetry {{structure of}} a general singular theory (theory with constraints in the Hamiltonian formulation), and, in particular, we relate the structure of gauge transformations with the constraint structure. We show that any symmetry transformation can be represented as a sum of three kinds of symmetries: global, gauge, and trivial symmetries. We construct explicitly all the corresponding conserved charges as decompositions in a special constraint basis. The global part of a symmetry does not <b>vanish</b> on the extremals, and the corresponding charge does not <b>vanish</b> on the extremals as well. The gauge part of a symmetry does not <b>vanish</b> on the extremals, but the gauge charge <b>vanishes</b> on them. We stress that the gauge charge necessarily contains a part that <b>vanishes</b> linearly in the first-class constraints and the remaining part of the gauge charge <b>vanishes</b> quadratically on the extremals. The trivial part of any symmetry <b>vanishes</b> on the extremals, and the corresponding charge <b>vanishes</b> quadratically on the extremals. ...|$|R

5|$|Enumerative {{problems}} in mathematics often concern {{a class of}} geometric objects called algebraic varieties which are defined by the <b>vanishing</b> of polynomials.

On December 26, 1987, the band participated in an audition held by CBS/Sony {{which led to a}} recording contract in August of the following year. In the meantime the band released its first album, <b>Vanishing</b> Vision through Extasy Records on April 14, 1988, and toured extensively in support of the record. The album's first press of 10,000 copies sold out in a week, topping the Oricon indies chart and reaching number 19 on the main chart. The <b>Vanishing</b> Tour Vol.2 took the band to 20 locations for 24 shows from June to July, while the Burn Out Tour had 12 performances throughout October. In November, X participated in music magazine Rockin'fs Street Fighting Men concert at Differ Ariake Arena.

The Mascarene parrot lived with other now-extinct birds, such as the Réunion ibis, the Mascarene parrot, the Réunion parakeet, the Réunion swamphen, the Réunion owl, the Réunion night heron, and the Réunion pink pigeon. Extinct Réunion reptiles include the Réunion giant tortoise and an undescribed Leiolopisma skink.
