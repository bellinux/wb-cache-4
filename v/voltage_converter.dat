40|$|Introduction. Determination {{of power}} quality indices in {{high-voltage}} power grids allows {{to find the}} reasons for the deterioration of the power quality. The relevant national and International Standards for power quality contain relevant norms of quality indices and requirements for their accuracy measurement. Problem. The most complicated part in the process of measuring the power quality indices at high voltage is the selection of the corresponding high-voltage scale <b>voltage</b> <b>converters.</b> Therefore, comparing the requirements of IEC 61000 - 4 - 30 to high <b>voltage</b> scale <b>voltage</b> <b>converters</b> is an important task. Goal. Analysis of the International Standard IEC 61000 - 4 - 30 requirements feasibility for measuring the indices of power quality in high-voltage electrical networks using different types of high-voltage scale <b>voltage</b> <b>converters.</b> Methodology. Comparison of the requirements of IEC 61000 - 4 - 30 Standard to high-voltage scale <b>voltage</b> <b>converters,</b> when measuring power quality indices, with the characteristics of high voltage electromagnetic transformers used in Ukraine, and with promising developments of high-voltage converters of other types. Results. It is shown in the study that in order to fulfill some of the requirements for class A of IEC 61000 - 4 - 30, the characteristics of electromagnetic voltage transformers should be determined in the substation conditions using mobile calibration high-voltage laboratories. To meet all the requirements for Class A IEC 61000 - 4 - 30, it is recommended to use broadband high-voltage dividers of resistive-capacitive type. Originality. In study it is shown firstly that all the requirements of the IEC 61000 - 4 - 30 Standard for high-voltage scale <b>voltage</b> <b>converters</b> can be performed {{on the basis of the}} use of broadband resistive-capacitive damped voltage dividers.

50|$|A {{common use}} of the <b>voltage</b> <b>converter</b> is for a device that allows {{appliances}} made for the mains voltage of one geographical region to operate in an area with different voltage. Such a device may be called a <b>voltage</b> <b>converter,</b> power converter, travel adapter, etc. Most single phase alternating-current electrical outlets in the world supply power at 210-240 V or at 100-120 V. A transformer or autotransformer can be used; (auto)transformers are inherently reversible, so the same transformer {{can be used to}} step the voltage up, or step it down by the same ratio. Lighter and smaller devices can be made using electronic circuitry; reducing the voltage electronically is simpler and cheaper than increasing it. Small, inexpensive, travel adapters suitable for low-power devices such as electric shavers, but not, say, hairdriers, are available; travel adapters usually include plug-end adapters for the different standards used in different countries. A transformer would be used for higher power.|$|E

40|$|Modern power {{electric}} drives brought advantages in induction motor control.

5000|$|About 8,000 {{units were}} built between 1994 and 2000. Guitarists praised the clear, uncolored {{tone of the}} boosted signal. The circuit had unique characteristics, most noticeably {{the use of an}} IC MAX1044 <b>voltage</b> <b>converter.</b> The <b>voltage</b> <b>converter</b> drives 18 volts to the {{operational}} amplifier which is the core of the circuit; at this voltage the response of the amplifier is different than at 9 volt, since its slew rate depends on the voltage supply. Higher the voltage supply, higher the order of harmonics the operational amplifier will generate, and more metallic the sound. Depending on the position of the knobs, the overdrive effect could be created in the amplifier instead by the circuit itself. The circuit had two germanium diodes to perform clipping (see Clipping (audio)). The [...] "gain" [...] knob is a double potentiometer (a [...] "dual-ganged gain pot"), which controls bass and middle frequencies. Other knobs are treble and volume.|$|E
50|$|Another unpopular {{change was}} {{the removal of}} the <b>voltage</b> <b>converter.</b> While the {{built-in}} power supply made the IIc Plus a more integrated one-piece unit for desktop use, the negative aspect was the loss of the ability to operate the machine from a battery source. This, in turn, eroded the portability aspect of the IIc series, rooting it further to a desktop-only environment. The removal of the audio-out jack used for headphones or a speaker was another feature users missed.|$|E

40|$|At present, the {{designers}} of <b>voltage</b> <b>converters</b> {{can choose from}} a wide variety of custom integrated drivers operating at different principles. The authors of this paper aim to show that although the two different designs of a step-down <b>voltage</b> <b>converters</b> can achieve comparable nominal values, at least from the view of the user, due to the differences in the basic principles applied in their drivers they may exhibit different behaviour in the area of the electromagnetic compatibility. This can lead to considerable problems in design of more complex circuits these <b>voltage</b> <b>converters</b> are a part of. For the purposes of the hereby presented results, two different constructions of step-down converters have been chosen. The first one is based on a low-cost and randomly operating solution based on the driver MC 34063 while the second one employs more advanced driver marketed under the label AP 1501. Both converters were constructed and tested for the purposes of application in a power backup device for Power over the Ethernet. The nominal input <b>voltage</b> of both <b>converters</b> is 24 V while their nominal output voltage is 12 V, as used in common applications. Both converters were tested in the EMC laboratory of Tomas Bata University Zlin in order to obtain not only the static parameters, but also the information on how they can interfere with other electronic devices.
