5|$|The game's {{head-up display}} simulates {{the inside of}} Samus's helmet and {{features}} a radar, map, missile ammunition meter and health meter. Several <b>visors</b> are available, and each performs a different function. One, also seen in the previous game, is a scanner that searches for enemy weaknesses, interfaces with mechanisms such as force fields and elevators and retrieves text entries from certain sources. The others reveal and highlight interdimensional objects or cloaked enemies, and create a visual representation of sound.|$|E
5|$|The C5 was {{launched}} on 10 January 1985 at Alexandra Palace in North London. The event was staged in Sinclair's usual glitzy style, with girls handing out press packs {{and a variety}} of promotional giveaways: magazines, hats, pullovers, T-shirts, key rings, sun <b>visors,</b> badges, mugs, bags, and even a C5 video game. The vehicle was given a dramatic unveiling; six C5s driven by girls dressed in grey and yellow burst out of six cardboard boxes, drove around the arena, and lined up side by side. Sinclair announced the launch of a £3 million, three-month-long advertising print and television advertising campaign. The C5 would be available initially by mail order at a cost of £399 and would subsequently be sold via high-street stores.|$|E
5|$|The Crosby Garrett helmet is {{an almost}} {{complete}} example of a two-piece Roman cavalry helmet. The visor portrays {{the face of a}} youthful, clean-shaven male with curly hair. The headpiece is {{in the shape of a}} Phrygian cap, on the crest of which is a winged griffin that stands with one raised foot resting on an amphora. The visor was originally attached to the headpiece by means of a hinge; the iron hinge pin has not survived, but its existence has been inferred from the presence of powdery deposits of iron oxide residue. The helmet would have been held in place using a leather strap attached from the wearer's neck to a decorated rivet on either side of the helmet, below the ear. Wear marks caused by opening and closing the visor are still visible, and at some point the helmet was repaired using a bronze sheet which was riveted across two splits. Only two other Roman helmets complete with <b>visors</b> have been found in Britain – the Newstead Helmet and Ribchester Helmet.|$|E
50|$|A sports <b>visor</b> — {{also called}} a sun <b>visor</b> or <b>visor</b> cap — {{is a type}} of crownless hat {{consisting}} simply of a <b>visor</b> or brim with a strap encircling the head. The top of the head is not covered and the <b>visor</b> protects only the face, including eyes, nose, and cheeks, from the sun.|$|R

5|$|The game's {{heads-up display}} simulates {{the inside of}} Samus' helmet, and {{features}} a radar, map, ammunition gauge and health meter. The player can change <b>visors</b> to enable new abilities such as X-ray vision, collecting information on many items, creatures and enemies, and interfacing with certain mechanisms such as force fields and elevators. Corruption also includes a hint system that periodically displays on-screen instructions and navigation assistance. The game also has {{the addition of the}} Hypermode, a feature in which health is drained to give temporary invincibility and more powerful attacks. After a certain amount of time, the player will enter Corrupt Hypermode, and if not stopped leads to a non-standard game over due to Samus being overtaken by Phazon. Another new feature is the Command Visor, which allows Samus to summon remotely her gunship from a suitable landing site to save the game, or travel to another destination quickly. During the progress of the game, new abilities can be obtained to allow it to perform aerial attacks against enemy targets and transport heavy objects.|$|E
5|$|With filming complete, MJZ {{contacted}} post-production company Asylum {{to begin}} work on the substantial visual effects component of The Life. The team, led by Visual Effects Supervisor Robert Moggach, tripled in size as {{the scale of the}} work required became apparent, given the deadline of three weeks. Work on the opening funeral scene was relatively easy, requiring the creation of only minor elements such as additional tombstones in the foreground and color correction on the actors. The same was true for the training sequence, where only minimal tracking work and compositing of matte backgrounds was required. The bulk of the visual effects work was in the battle sequence. This ranged from simple work such as wire removal to the creation of dynamic lighting and reflections from <b>visors</b> and armor, to particle effects for the background smoke and dust, plasma weapon fire and alterations to some of the filmed explosions to lend them the appearance given to plasma explosions within the Halo games. The entire background was a 3D projection of matte paintings and dramatic skies. While the Brute was partially animatronic, substantial adjustments such as scaling to almost twice the size and the enhancement of fine muscle movements of the creature were made. Other elements, such as the Banshee aircraft and the drop-pods, were created entirely through the use of CGI. Software used by Asylum FX included Flame and Nuke for compositing, Maya for animation, RenderMan and Mantra for rendering, SynthEyes for tracking, Silhouette Pro for rotoscoping work.|$|E
25|$|The {{children}} {{access the}} virtual world through Internet-connected <b>visors,</b> which they refer to as megane, the usual term for protective or corrective eyeglasses. The <b>visors</b> allow them to see virtual reality superimposed on objective reality. To visually confirm something as virtual, the children often lift their <b>visors</b> from their eyes. The <b>visors</b> also work in conjunction with futuristic ear monitors placed behind the ear, which allow the wearer to hear sounds from the virtual environment.|$|E
50|$|The wearer {{peered through}} two vision slots when the <b>visor</b> was lowered. The vision slots were either {{relatively}} {{flush with the}} <b>visor,</b> as was the custom in Western Europe, or elevated on mounts on the <b>visor,</b> as was commonly the case in Central Europe.|$|R
30|$|<b>VISOR</b> will {{assess the}} {{potential}} for validation of the GB system models using both of these approaches, with data from the <b>VISOR</b> WAMS. Furthermore, {{the extent to which}} SSO as well as small and large-signal behavior observed by <b>VISOR</b> is replicated in the system model will be assessed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Visor</b> Platinum was {{available}} only in a silver (platinum) or black colored shell, {{as opposed to the}} <b>Visor</b> Deluxe's many color choices.|$|R
25|$|Polycarbonate is {{commonly}} used in eye protection, {{as well as in}} other projectile-resistant viewing and lighting applications that would normally indicate the use of glass, but require much higher impact-resistance. Polycarbonate lenses also protect the eye from UV light. Many kinds of lenses are manufactured from polycarbonate, including automotive headlamp lenses, lighting lenses, sunglass/eyeglass lenses, swimming goggles and SCUBA masks, and safety glasses/goggles/visors including <b>visors</b> in sporting helmets/masks and police riot gear (helmet <b>visors,</b> riot shields, etc.). Windscreens in small motorized vehicles are commonly made of polycarbonate, such as for motorcycles, ATVs, golf carts, and small planes and helicopters.|$|E
25|$|Wilson Staff: golf {{caps and}} <b>visors,</b> belts, golf towels, golf bags (staff, cart and stand types {{as well as}} golf bags with NFL team logos), travel bags, golf umbrellas, {{golf club head covers}} and golf gloves.|$|E
25|$|Armoury; 6 helmets; 22 cuirasses without rests; 14 sallets with bavers; 100 sallets with <b>visors</b> and bavors; a sallet with 2 bullions of silver; 2 steel bonnets; 12 {{pairs of}} gauntlets; 32 pairs of leg harness; 36 pairs of splints (arm protection); 19 pairs of brigandines; etc.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike the Palm Pilot, the <b>Visor's</b> {{infrared}} port {{was placed on}} the side of the device to make room for the Springboard Expansion Slot. The <b>Visor</b> and <b>Visor</b> Deluxe weight is 5.4 oz. Their dimensions are 4.8" [...] x 3.0" [...] x 0.7". The display is 2.25 inches square with diagonal span of 3.0 inches.|$|R
40|$|The TV camera <b>visor</b> {{was placed}} in a vacuum chamber and {{examined}} for alpha radioactivity using an alpha-scattering instrument, and plates covered with the same paint and made {{at the same time as}} the <b>visor</b> were used as a control. The spectra of <b>visor</b> and plates are very similar, and it is concluded that the gross activity on the <b>visor</b> is due entirely to the activity of the paint. The data were used to obtain the amount of Po- 210 activity on the lunar surface. It is felt that the lack of detected alpha radioactivity does not indicate a lack of activity on the moon, since dust layers were knocked off the <b>visor...</b>|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} helmets {{surviving}} with 'grotesque' <b>visors.</b> These {{are thought to}} have been used as part of a 'costume armour' worn at parades and during festivities. Some of these masks portrayed the heads of animals or demons, whilst others were evidently for comic effect, being caricatures of the faces of their owners.|$|E
25|$|The small sun <b>visors</b> on the DeLorean have vinyl on one side, and {{headliner}} fabric on {{the other}} side. Originally these were installed such that the headliner side {{would be on the}} bottom when not in use. Later on in 1981, they were reversed so that the vinyl side would be on the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{equipment}} for 1953 included bumper guards, electric clock, lined trunk, dual horns, cigarette lighter, chrome moldings, twin interior sun <b>visors,</b> rear seat robe rails, special rear stainless steel trim, chrome window ventiplanes, windshield washer, and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring. In 1953 a padded safety dash also became standard on the 98. For {{the first time}} air conditioning was an option.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 This {{thesis is}} about meta-form near-eye <b>visor</b> (NEV). Near eye <b>visor</b> {{is the core}} {{component}} in a head mounted display (HMD), because it directly decides the quality and volume of HMD. Regarding freeform NEV, a limitation on Field of View (FOV) is proposed. A flat shape phase mask <b>visor,</b> termed here as meta-form <b>visor,</b> is used to replace the freeform NEV to lift the limitation. Metasurface is chosen to work as the <b>visor,</b> because of its flat surface and capability to implement spatial modulation to incident light wave. Metasurface is a two-dimensional array of subwavelength scatterers. Meta-form <b>visor’s</b> vision performance is simulated in Zemax. Image simulation using the designed metasurface is performed in Lumerical FDTD. In this design dielectric material is chosen to compose the metasurface, for its lower loss in visible frequency than metallic metasurface...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>visor</b> swung up {{to uncover}} the wearer's face {{when he was not}} in combat, to grant him better {{visibility}} and unrestricted ventilation. This was accomplished in one of two ways. The most common form of <b>visor</b> in Central Europe was held on by a single hinge fastened {{to the center of the}} top of the <b>visor,</b> called a Klappviser. The other version had two pivot bolts on either side of the <b>visor</b> attaching it to the bascinet at the temples, and this was the most common form found in Southern, Western and Northwestern Europe.|$|R
50|$|Polysulfone was {{the primary}} {{component}} of the gold-plated lunar extravehicular <b>visor</b> assembly, the iconic gold-film <b>visor</b> portion of the Apollo space-suits worn by Apollo astronauts during their lunar excursions.|$|R
25|$|Power {{steering}} and power drum brakes were also standard, as on all Rambler Custom models. The car was {{available only in}} silver metallic paint accented with gold anodized aluminum inserts along the sides. Padded dashboards and <b>visors,</b> rear child proof door locks, and seat belts were all optional. A total of 1,500 Rebels were produced in 1957. Integrated air conditioning system, the All Weather Eye was a $345 option.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the auto}} {{component}} companies other than Maruti Suzuki started to offer components and accessories that were compatible. This caused a serious threat and loss of revenue to Maruti Suzuki. Maruti Suzuki started a new initiative under the brand name Maruti Genuine Accessories to offer accessories like alloy wheels, body cover, carpets, door <b>visors,</b> fog lamps, stereo systems, seat covers and other car care products. These products are sold through dealer outlets and authorized service stations throughout India.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} as an illustrator, looking {{at a picture of}} Stig Blomqvist in his driver's overall and helmet, Bamber began to {{practice}} cartoon drawing of drivers in overalls and a full-face helmet, of whom Blomqvist was the first caricature drawn by Bamber. Rather than drawing faces of drivers, a common feature at the time, he shortcutted it by drawing a ball as a helmet and adding names above their <b>visors</b> to identify drivers. Bamber would continue to practice drawing drivers' caricatures, while working as an illustrator and as an Art Editor for Rallycourse yearbooks.|$|E
5000|$|Early 1960 [...] Dr. Thomas Tredici and Dr. Donald Pitts {{developed}} a gold <b>visor</b> which protected the eyes from harmful ultraviolet and infrared radiation. NASA used the <b>visor</b> {{in the face}} shield of its Apollo astronauts who landed on the moon. Without the <b>visor,</b> the astronauts would have been temporarily blinded by infrared radiation and unable to perform their missions.|$|R
40|$|A sun <b>visor</b> {{has been}} used only {{for the purpose of}} {{interrupting}} direct sunshine. Investigation, therefore, has not been made to be on the feeling of touch of the sun <b>visor.</b> In this study, the feeling of touch of sun <b>visor</b> installed in the present automobile was investigated. To clarify the relation between the sense of touch and the mechanical and physical quantity of the sun <b>visor,</b> prototype products of the sun <b>visor</b> of the same shape were made. Surface characteristics and cold feel characteristic of materials were measured by the KES system. In addition, we investigated the relation between the surface property and the sense of touch of various materials. The correlation between favorability and WC, RC, SMD was high on the sun <b>visor</b> prototype. As a result, it was clarified that materials whose surfaces were very smooth and soft were favorable. Those materials consist of leather and moquette. Conversely, the material sensed hard was not favorable. The relation between the mechanical and the physica...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the series}} Star Trek: The Next Generation, the {{character}} Geordi La Forge (played by LeVar Burton) wears {{a piece of}} technology called a <b>VISOR</b> {{that allows him to}} [...] "see" [...] despite being blind from birth by directly sending the information into his brain. The device also gave him the ability to see in the electromagnetic and infrared spectrums. The <b>VISOR</b> was used as a plot device throughout multiple episodes, including one where the <b>VISOR</b> is used to brainwash La Forge and one where emanations from the <b>VISOR</b> caused the character Worf to shift between parallel universes. Finally, in the movie Star Trek Generations, a group of Klingons used the <b>VISOR</b> to transmit the shield frequencies of the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) to their ship, which allowed them to fatally cripple the Enterprise-D before they were destroyed. When La Forge is next seen, in the movie Star Trek: First Contact, he no longer wears his <b>VISOR</b> in lieu of the more innocuous-looking ocular implants.|$|R
25|$|The 1967 models {{received}} {{nothing more}} than a touch-up after a restyling for 1966. All Novas got a crosshatch pattern that filled the deck lid trim panel. The Nova officially was still called the Chevy II Nova and had overtaken the bottom-rung Chevy II 100 in sales. The Chevy II 100 lacked {{much in the way of}} trim or brightwork. 1967 models carried significant improvements in the area of safety equipment. A government-mandated energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, soft interior parts such as armrests and sun <b>visors,</b> recessed instrument panel knobs, and front shoulder belt anchors, were included in all 1967 models.|$|E
25|$|Witness James Tague {{was also}} injured by the shots when he {{received}} a superficial face wound. The Main Street south curb he had been standing 23.5 feet away from {{was struck by a}} bullet or bullet fragment that had no copper sheath, and a fragment of the concrete curb or a bullet fragment struck Tague on his right cheek. At Zapruder frame 313 Tague's head top was located 271 feet away from and 16.4 feet below President Kennedy's head top and the limousine's front windshield and its pushed nearly vertically straight-upwards sun <b>visors</b> were in between the president and the impacted curb point. The bullet or bullet fragment that struck the concrete curb was never found.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{at around}} 1500 armour, {{including}} helmets, became more immediately influenced by fashion, especially in civilian clothing. As a result close helmets {{came in a}} huge variety of forms. The earliest close helmets resembled contemporary armets. In Italy, England and France in the period 1510-25 helmets were rounded with <b>visors</b> of the 'sparrow's beak' form, whereas in Germany, the fluted 'Maximillian' style of armour produced distinctive types of helmet. The skulls of these helmets were globular with a low crest, many were decorated with fluting but some were plain. Two types of visor were produced, the Nuremberg form which had a 'bellows' shape, and the Augsburg form which was more projecting and is commonly called a 'monkey face'.|$|E

30|$|Delivering the <b>VISOR</b> WAMS is {{an ambitious}} undertaking, which {{requires}} {{the deployment of}} new sensors, communication links and computing hardware. However, deploying new assets {{is not the only}} challenge faced by <b>VISOR.</b> Integrating the existing WAMS assets in GB into the <b>VISOR</b> WAMS is an essential aspect of delivering the breadth of monitoring necessary at an acceptable cost. These assets were not used or maintained as part of a production system (i.e. they did not contribute to the everyday operation of the power system). Therefore, an essential aspect of <b>VISOR</b> is assessing the performance of these existing WAMS assets and incorporating them into the <b>VISOR</b> WAMS. Many of these are older devices, not initially designed for synchronized phasor measurement, which have subsequently received firmware updates to incorporate PMU functionality.|$|R
