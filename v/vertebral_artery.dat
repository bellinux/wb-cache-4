5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} reports of associated risk factors for <b>vertebral</b> <b>artery</b> dissection; many of these reports suffer from methodological weaknesses, such as selection bias. Elevated homocysteine levels, often due to mutations in the MTHFR gene, appear to {{increase the risk of}} <b>vertebral</b> <b>artery</b> dissection.

5|$|<b>Vertebral</b> <b>artery</b> {{dissection}} (VAD) is a flap-like tear of {{the inner}} lining of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>artery,</b> which {{is located in the}} neck and supplies blood to the brain. After the tear, blood enters the arterial wall and forms a blood clot, thickening the artery wall and often impeding blood flow. The symptoms of <b>vertebral</b> <b>artery</b> dissection include head and neck pain and intermittent or permanent stroke symptoms such as difficulty speaking, impaired coordination and visual loss. It is usually diagnosed with a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether lumen narrowing in <b>vertebral</b> <b>arteries</b> during atlanto-axial rotation {{is due to}} stretch or localized compression. Design and Setting: Experiments with models were made in a private chiropractic clinic, whereas studies of cadaveric specimens were performed in an anatomy laboratory. Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) {{studies were carried out}} in the radiology department of a public hospital. Patients: Eight patients had their <b>vertebral</b> <b>arteries</b> examined by use of a Doppler velocimeter and MRA. Main Outcome Measure: Stenosis of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>arteries</b> caused by stretch, localized compression, or kinking. Results: All 16 <b>vertebral</b> <b>arteries</b> from the 8 patients displayed no changes in their lumen dimensions with full cervical rotation, although curves in each of the arteries did change. The model and cadaveric <b>vertebral</b> <b>arteries</b> demonstrated localized compression or kinking of the vessel wall with atlanto-axial rotation contralaterally but revealed no evidence of major contribution of stretching to stenosis. Conclusion: The lumen of <b>vertebral</b> <b>arteries</b> is usually unaffected by atlanto-axial rotation. In cases where there is stenosis, this is mainly due to localized compression or kinking. These findings are relevant to premanipulative screening of <b>vertebral</b> <b>arteries</b> with Doppler ultrasound scanning...|$|R

5|$|<b>Vertebral</b> <b>artery</b> {{dissection}} {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of dissection of the arteries in the neck.

40|$|Takayasu {{arteritis}} (TA) is {{an inflammatory}} vascular disease that mainly affects the aorta {{and its main}} branches.

5|$|Head pain {{occurs in}} 50â€“75% {{of all cases}} of <b>vertebral</b> <b>artery</b> dissection. It tends to be located {{at the back of}} the head, either on the {{affected}} side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or throbbing. About half of those with VAD consider the headache distinct, while the remainder have had a similar headache before. It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of all cases of vertebral and carotid dissection are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is focused}} on {{reducing}} stroke episodes and damage from a distending artery. Four treatment modalities {{have been reported in}} the treatment of <b>vertebral</b> <b>artery</b> dissection. The two main treatments involve medication: anticoagulation (using heparin and warfarin) and antiplatelet drugs (usually aspirin). More rarely, thrombolysis (medication that dissolves blood clots) may be administered, and occasionally obstruction may be treated with angioplasty and stenting. No randomized controlled trials have been performed to compare the different treatment modalities. Surgery is only used in exceptional cases.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vertebral</b> <b>artery</b> {{dissection}} {{has also}} been reported in association with some forms of neck manipulation. There is significant controversy {{about the level of}} risk of stroke from neck manipulation. It may be that manipulation can cause dissection, or {{it may be that the}} dissection is already present in some people who seek manipulative treatment. At this time, conclusive evidence does not exist to support either a strong association between neck manipulation and stroke, or no association.|$|E

5|$|<b>Vertebral</b> <b>artery</b> {{dissection}} is {{less common}} than carotid artery dissection (dissection {{of the large}} arteries {{in the front of}} the neck). The two conditions together account for 10â€“25% of non-hemorrhagic strokes in young and middle-aged people. Over 75% recover completely or with minimal impact on functioning, with the remainder having more severe disability and a very small proportion (about 2%) dying from complications. It was first described in the 1970s by the Canadian neurologist C. Miller Fisher.|$|E
5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and <b>vertebral</b> <b>artery</b> dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E
5|$|In 15â€“20 {{percent of}} cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, no aneurysm is detected on the first angiogram. About half of these are attributed to non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage, in which the blood {{is limited to the}} subarachnoid spaces around the midbrain (i.e. mesencephalon). In these, the origin of the blood is uncertain. The remainder are due to other disorders affecting the blood vessels (such as cerebral arteriovenous malformations), disorders of the blood vessels in the spinal cord, and bleeding into various tumors. Cocaine abuse and sickle cell anemia (usually in children) and, rarely, anticoagulant therapy, problems with blood clotting and pituitary apoplexy can also result in SAH. Dissection of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>artery,</b> usually caused by trauma, can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if the dissection involves the part of the vessel inside the skull.|$|E

5|$|The {{vertebral}} arteries {{arise from}} the subclavian artery, and run through the transverse foramen of the upper six vertebrae of the neck. After exiting {{at the level of}} the first cervical vertebra, its course changes from vertical to horizontal, and then enters the skull through the foramen magnum. Inside the skull, the arteries merge to form the basilar artery, which joins the circle of Willis. In total, three quarters of the artery are outside the skull; it has a high mobility in this area due to rotational movement in the neck and is therefore vulnerable to trauma. Most dissections happen {{at the level of the}} first and second vertebrae. The <b>vertebral</b> <b>artery</b> supplies a number of vital structures in the posterior cranial fossa, such as the brainstem, the cerebellum and the occipital lobes. The brainstem harbors a number of vital functions (such as respiration) and controls the nerves of the face and neck. The cerebellum is part of the diffuse system that coordinates movement. Finally, the occipital lobes participate in the sense of vision.|$|E
5|$|Obstruction {{of blood}} {{flow through the}} {{affected}} vessel may lead to dysfunction of {{part of the brain}} supplied by the artery. This happens in 77â€“96% of cases. This may be temporary ("transient ischemic attack") in 10â€“16% of cases, but many (67â€“85% of cases) end up with a permanent deficit or a stroke. The <b>vertebral</b> <b>artery</b> supplies {{the part of the brain}} that lies in the posterior fossa of the skull, and this type of stroke is therefore called a posterior circulation infarct. Problems may include difficulty speaking or swallowing (lateral medullary syndrome); this occurs in less than a fifth of cases and occurs due to dysfunction of the brainstem. Others may experience unsteadiness or lack of coordination due to involvement of the cerebellum, and still others may develop visual loss (on one side of the visual field) due to involvement of the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. In the event of involvement of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem, a partial Horner's syndrome may develop; this is the combination of a drooping eyelid, constricted pupil, and an apparently sunken eye on one side of the face.|$|E
25|$|Large vessel disease {{involves}} the common and internal carotid arteries, the <b>vertebral</b> <b>artery,</b> and the Circle of Willis. Diseases that may form thrombi {{in the large}} vessels include (in descending incidence): atherosclerosis, vasoconstriction (tightening of the artery), aortic, carotid or <b>vertebral</b> <b>artery</b> dissection, various inflammatory diseases of the blood vessel wall (Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, vasculitis), noninflammatory vasculopathy, Moyamoya disease and fibromuscular dysplasia.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the cause of right to left signal intensity differences arising from intracranial vessels during routine spin-echo axial MR imaging of the head. Methods and Results: Using a normal imaging sequence in which the default directions of the frequency and phase axes were horizontal and vertical, respectively, differences in signal intensity arising from the <b>vertebral</b> <b>arteries</b> were observed in a healthy subject. With the exchange of the frequency and phase axes relative to the normal sequence, no signal intensity differences between the <b>vertebral</b> <b>arteries</b> were recognized. Other pulse sequence modifications, ie, the use of motion-compensating gradients and the reversed polarity of the frequency-encoding gradient, also resulted in variable appearances of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>arteries,</b> indicating that the right-to-left signal asymmetry of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>arteries</b> observed on the normal spin-echo image results from a pulse sequence dependent phenomenon. Conclusions: Frequency-encoding and slice-selection gradients both produce motion-induced phase shifts. These phase shifts depend on the angle between the direction of flow and that of the effective vector sum of these gradients. The asymmetric appearance of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>arteries</b> during normal spin-echo imaging was found to result from the angle dependence of motion-induced phase shifts. Awareness of this artifactual phenomenon is important to avoid confusing it with conditions such as stenosis / occlusion, dissection, or slow flow...|$|R
