40|$|Abstract. The {{following}} {{conclusion is}} drawn from detailed mechanical analysis of Diamond Saw Blade,The load on diamond is not significant in cutting. However, {{at the moment the}} blade starts in its working state, the impact on rock has significant destructiveness on diamonds. Higher linear velocity of the blade, higher rock hardness and higher feeding speed all contribute in greater impact force on the diamond from the rock. And it is also stated that the unstable quality of diamond saw blade is closely related to the selection of diamond without following the TT 1 test result. When designing the diamond saw blade, the saw cutting performance of the rock should be taken into consideration, as well as the necessary analysis of the force on the blade. There are three forces exerted on the saw blade: <b>vertical</b> <b>downward</b> pressure; horizontal feeding thrust; tangential cutting force of the saw. They are discussed separately in the following. <b>Vertical</b> <b>Downward</b> Pressure The <b>vertical</b> <b>downward</b> pressure from the saw is its gravity. If the pressure accesses the gravity, the cutting machine system will bear a moment, which results in deflection of the blade. Also the cut stone is deflected. Therefore, the <b>vertical</b> <b>downward</b> pressure on blade from the saw should be equal to or a little less than the gravity of the saw. The gravity of the saw can be calculated by using the following equation: 2 310 4 w D b r π − = ⋅ ⋅ × (1) In this equation: w-weight of the saw. kgf, D-diameter of the saw. cm, γ-proportion of steel, b-thickness of the saw,φ 1. 6 m, for the saw, b= 0. 7 cm.

The rate of heat transfer was maintained {{at an average of}} 250 W throughout the experiment while the mean vapour qualities ranged between 0. 1 and 0. 9, mass flux between 200 kg/m 2 s and 400 kg/m 2 s for inclination angles varied between - 90 o (<b>vertical</b> <b>downward)</b> and + 90 o (vertical upward) covering the whole range of inclination at saturation temperature of 50 oC.

40|$|The geomechanical {{modeling}} {{of failure and}} post-failure stages of rainfall-induced shallow landslides represents a fundamental issue to properly assess the failure conditions and recognize the potential for long travel distances of the failed soil masses. Considering that these phenomena {{are among the most}} catastrophic natural hazard, as a contribution to the topic, the paper discusses the potentialities of a hydro-mechanical coupled FEM model to analyze the post-failure stage using an advanced constitutive model. Particularly, simple undrained triaxial tests and experimental evidences of centrifuge tests are reproduced firstly, for both cases of loose and dense soils. Then, two slope scale benchmarks are analyzed in the cases of <b>vertical</b> <b>downward</b> or horizontal water seepage and for both loose and dense soils. Compared with results obtained through standard limit equilibrium analyses, coupled FEM model provides a new comprehensive framework for failure and post-failure scenarios which includes a significant reduction of mean effective stresses also {{in the case of a}} loose soil slope subjected to <b>vertical</b> <b>downward</b> water seepage. The obtained results are particularly encouraging since they outline the possibility to analyse in a unique framework both the failure and post-failure stages. Moreover, the numerical analyses indicate that the post-failure mechanisms are intimately tied to specific predisposing factors and boundary conditions, rather than to a single mechanical or state parameter of soil, such as for instance the soil relative density...|$|R
