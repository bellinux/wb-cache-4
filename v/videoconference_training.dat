40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the effect of <b>videoconferencing</b> in <b>training</b> staff to implement discrete trial teaching in real life settings with children with autism. Fourteen participants {{were randomly assigned to}} two groups. One group received training on-site and the other group received <b>training</b> via <b>videoconference.</b> The participants in both groups received 3 Ã— 15 min of training on three different teaching programs: matching, receptive and expressive labeling. The results showed {{no significant differences between the}} groups in the post-test whilst both groups improved significantly following training. Although preliminary, these results suggest that videoconferencing can be a cost-saving way to train staff in how to implement discrete trial teaching...|$|R
40|$|As we face {{a revolutionary}} move towards {{e-learning}} and away from traditional face-to-face training, today's human resource manager implementing technology-supported training needs a concise, practical handbook outlining the choices {{that have to be}} made and the implications of each approach. 'Towards a learning organisation' brings human resource managers up-to-date with the various applications that are open to them, such as Electronic Learning Environments, Web based <b>training,</b> <b>Videoconferencing,</b> etc. This handbook provides user-friendly information about emerging technologies for training, checklists and other decision-making tools. Based on broad experience and peppered throughout with case studies and examples from leading European companies and institutions, it also offers plenty of background information including an onverview of network options as well as a handy glossary and further resources list...|$|R
40|$|Videoconferencing was {{introduced}} in the Queensland health service in 1995. By the end of 1999, there were more than 150 videoconferencing units in health facilities around the state. Six audits of videoconferencing usage were conducted using similar methodology at six-month intervals from November 1997 to May 2000. Between November 1997 and November 1999, the number of calls more than doubled, from 566 to 1378. Hours of usage almost trebled, from 671 to 1724. The average duration of calls remained similar, at about I h 12 min. The proportion of calls involving more than two sites (multipoint videoconferences) increased from 44 % to 65 %. The majority of the activity was for education (including <b>training).</b> <b>Videoconferencing</b> was also used for administration and clinical care. Mental health staff were the heaviest users, but use by health professionals from other specialty areas increased during the study period. The Queensland health service has realized a number of important benefits from telehealth...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} article 1 {{is to present}} {{a review of the}} {{published}} literature on how to train staff to conduct discrete trials teaching (DTT). Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are related with complex learning challenges. DTT is a well documented effective training method which addresses some of these challenges. However, implementation of DTT requires considerable training. In spite of this, the literature investigating effective training methods for how to teach persons to conduct DTT is limited. This article reviews 21 publications from 1977 up till today focusing on training methods and methods for measuring the effect of the training. Overall, it is difficult to draw conclusions of which training method that has been effective due to large variations in training packages, the duration of the training, and the use of different methods for measuring teaching skills. Implications are discussed, including suggestions for future research. The study in article 2 investigated the effect of <b>videoconferencing</b> in <b>training</b> staff to implement discrete trials teaching in real life settings with children with autism. Fourteen participants were randomly assigned to two groups. One group received training on-site, the other group received <b>training</b> via <b>videoconference.</b> The participants received 3 x 15 minutes of training on three different programs; matching, receptive and expressive labeling. The results showed {{no significant differences between the}} groups in the post test whilst both groups had improved significantly following training. Although preliminary, these results suggests that videoconferencing can be an efficacious, rapid and cost-saving way to train staff in how to implement DT...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{addresses}} the {{increasing use of}} videoconferencing to avoid bringing criminal defendants to court for certain proceedings. Unfortunately, courts use videoconferencing technology to bring criminal defendants to court without carefully evaluating the impact of that practice on the quality of justice. This Article evaluates the implications of using technology to have defendants appear through videoconferencing and argues against the practice. It brings to bear the literature from other fields, particularly communications and social psychology. That body of literature suggests that videoconferencing may {{have a negative impact on}} the way the defendant is perceived by those in court as well as the representation the defendant receives and the way in which the defendant experiences the criminal justice system. The author argues that courts should not extend their reliance on videoconferencing further and instead must undertake studies to explore the impact of the technology in criminal proceedings. In addition, the author advocates that the courts take steps to ameliorate the negative impact of videoconferencing through design of <b>videoconferencing</b> systems and <b>training</b> of those who participate in videoconference proceedings. Finally, the author suggests that courts with videoconferencing equipment make it available for communication between incarcerated defendants and their attorneys. ...|$|R
