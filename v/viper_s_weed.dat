Snakes perched on lower layers of vegetation seeking cooler conditions when the ambient temperature within the enclosure was high. In addition, when the ambient temperature rose above 25 °C, tree vipers retreated into denser vegetation, which provided significantly lower temperatures due to shading. In contrast, tree vipers in low-temperature environments exhibited no preference for vegetation structures in terms of density, except for an apparent avoidance of vegetation with bare branches and no leaves.

It is a parasitic weed that penetrates the roots of other plants, diverting nutrients and water from the host plant and thus stunting their growth. Striga occurs mainly in cereal crops, such as maize, sorghum, fonio and millet, but Striga spp. also affects cowpeas and groundnuts. It has infested mainly the savanna areas in Africa and accounts for an estimated loss of 40 million tonnes of cereal annually continent-wide. Striga especially hits Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Mali, Nigeria, Sudan and Togo, but it is also present in the eastern and southern parts of the continent. In Kenya, striga is being fought off by planting desmodium (see box). The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Nigeria has devoted years to developing resistance in cereals against striga. By combining resistance in certain maize races with varieties that have a good production, IITA researchers have managed to breed striga tolerance in maize. Calliandra calothyrsus and Croton megalocarpus, both popular agroforestry tree species, release allelopathic (growth inhibiting) compounds into the environment which reduces striga infestation. The most straightforward method of weed control, after all is said and done, is probably through a acombination of measures such as intercropping with N-fixing and Striga repelling plants, and maintaining or increasing soil fertility.

Many people spend {{the majority of their}} time and effort in the homeplace and, in many instances, sustaining the homeplace {{is one of the major}} motivations of people 2 ̆ 7 s lives. Home is where we are first constructed, raise our families, share with our communities, work, grow old and possibly, wise. Contemporary critical studies, however, vastly underrepresents this instrumental site in the development of gender, race and class assumptions and dictates. The homeplace, as the work completed inside it, is devalued, demeaned and often times, ignored entirely. ^ To emphasize the home as a site in need of critical examination, I employ an approach that combines materialist feminism, theories of race and critiques of the outdated nineteenth-century theories of domesticity and the Cult of True Womanhood.

Using an endogenous risk framework, the papers model weed control decisions {{as they are}} affected by uncertainty and as they are affected by policies aimed at reducing nonpoint source pollution;The first paper adapts the theory of self protection and self insurance to weed control decisions in order to model substitutions between fertilizer and herbicides. Our results suggest that {{an increase in the}} probability of weed damage will generally decrease both herbicide and fertilizer application rates. We also show that increased probability of weed damage leads to use of less persistent herbicides and less fertilizer. Also, nonpoint pollution policies which restrict fertilizer quantities will tend to reduce herbicide rates and herbicide persistence, while policies which restrict herbicide rates or herbicide persistence will tend to reduce fertilizer rates;The second paper models weed control decisions using the concepts of self insurance and self protection to model substitutions among the types and quantities of herbicides used. Our results indicate that policies which restrict herbicide rates likely lead to use of more persistent herbicides, while policies which restrict the use of persistent herbicides likely lead to increased application rates. We also provide conditions to unambiguously sign the effects of increased application or effectiveness risk on optimal herbicide choices. Generally, risk leads to a tradeoff between herbicide rates and herbicide persistence;The third paper uses a biophysical modeling approach to construct and evaluate the environmental and economic effects of alternative nonpoint source pollution policies. Environmental and economic tradeoffs are compared for six sets of policies including five sets of tax policies and one set of bans.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} American {{writers in the}} 1920 s demonstrated the eugenic influence on motherhood through fictional representations of violent resistance. My project charts {{the ways in which}} fictional, dramatic, and cinematic texts displayed negative visualizations of maternity {{as a response to the}} early twentieth-century preoccupation with eugenics. In this project, I argue that these methods of opposition took place through actions of child abuse, maternal neglect, and infanticide. Part of this dissertation identifies eugenically motivated cultural discourse, including various forms of the media, that used both overt and subliminal messages to encourage pronatalism among the white upper and middle classes while promoting sterilization and the use of birth control for minority populations. By addressing this rhetoric, I draw attention to the pervading dialogue that influenced and shaped the texts used in the dissertation. In addition, to analyze depictions of positive and negative eugenics is to reveal a social policy powerful enough to go beyond issues of class and race and drastically impact American mothers as a united group; instead of being labeled as a problem of race, color, or class, I argue instead that these American modernist writers interpreted eugenic rhetoric as a problem of gender, common to any woman who found herself with child. While many studies exist on eugenics and literature, as well as on motherhood and literature, the combination of the two topics is one that has previously gone unanalyzed. Therefore, addressing the problems raised by this subject also highlights how both male and female writers were compelled to construct situations of subversive mothering. By situating my project in the 1920 - 1930 time frame, I limit my commentary to how writers approached eugenics during its most popular and influential time period in the United States. My chapters argue that these constructs of subversive motherhood appear through cinematic portrayals of dysgenic children and the negative effects on their maternal figures (The Phantom of the Opera and The Black Stork), unhappiness in the role of mother and outward expressions of anger toward the offspring in question (Edith Summers Kelley 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Weeds),</b> decisive participation in the act of abortion and infanticide (Nella Larsen 2 ̆ 7 s Quicksand), and daughters who refuse to participate in the act of mothering because of their negative upbringings (Edith Wharton 2 ̆ 7 s The Children). By incorporating the genres of fiction, drama, and cinema alongside historical and cultural documents, I inform my audience of the threatening and harmful realities of childbearing during this time period, and will show that the connection between eugenics and motherhood reflects a desire of American writers to reveal the grim repercussions of eugenic practice...|$|R

Despite belonging to the same species complex as domesticated rice and its wild relatives, the evolutionary origins of weedy rice remain unclear. We use genome-wide patterns of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation in a broad geographic sample of weedy, domesticated, and wild Oryza samples to infer the origin and demographic processes influencing U. S. weedy rice evolution. Results: We find greater population structure than has been previously reported for U.

40|$|The Economic European Community (EEC) {{is backing}} {{a joint venture}} of the French CIRAD (1) and the Tropical Weed Group's Research Division at Bristol in Great Britain in order to launch a two-year {{integrated}} weed control project in developing countries. The main objective set by researchers is to study the herbicide properties 'of certain root secretions of plants which could combat particularly harmful weeds, such as striga. This weed {{is one of the}} fastest proliferating species in Africa and Asia and will be subjected to intensive integrated control methods and new herbicides. The EEC project also includes a programme to train a dozen researchers from the Third World. It will be completed by the installation of an international information centre on vegetation destruction in developing countries. A telematic system of pest control information, named IPHYTO, already in operation in France, will be introduced Finally, bi-lingual technical cards on tropical crop destruction will soon be produced (1) ClRAD: Centre de Cooperation International en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement.

40|$|Background:Snake bite {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{neglected}} public health issues in poor rural communities worldwide. In addition to the clinical effects of envenoming, treatment with antivenom frequently causes serious adverse reactions, including hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) and pyrogenic reactions. We aimed to investigate the immune responses to Sri Lankan snake envenoming (predominantly by Russell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>viper)</b> and antivenom treatment. Methodology/Principal Findings:Plasma concentrations of Interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 10, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), soluble TNF receptor I (sTNFRI), anaphylatoxins (C 3 a, C 4 a, C 5 a; markers of complement activation), mast cell tryptase (MCT), and histamine were measured in 120 Sri Lankan snakebite victims, both before and after treatment with antivenom. Immune mediator concentrations were correlated with envenoming features and the severity of antivenom-induced reactions including anaphylaxis. Envenoming was associated with complement activation and increased cytokine concentrations prior to antivenom administration, which correlated with non-specific systemic symptoms of envenoming but not with coagulopathy or neurotoxicity. Typical hypersensitivity reactions to antivenom occurred in 77 / 120 patients (64...|$|R
