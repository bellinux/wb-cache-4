40|$|OBJECTIVE — Poor {{quality of}} {{diabetes}} care has been {{ascribed to the}} acute care focus of primary care practice. A {{better understanding of how}} time is spent during outpatient <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> diabetes compared with <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> acute conditions and other chronic diseases may facilitate the design of programs to enhance diabetes care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Research nurses directly observed consecu-tive outpatient visits during two separate days in 138 community family physician offices. Time use was categorized into 20 different behaviors using the Davis Observation Code (DOC). Time use was compared <b>for</b> <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> diabetes, other chronic conditions, and acute illnesses during 1, 867 visits by patients $ 40 years of age. RESULTS — Of 20 DOC behavioral categories, 10 exhibited differences among the three groups. Discriminant analysis identified two distinct factors that distinguished <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> chronic disease from <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> acute illness and <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> diabetes from those for other chronic diseases. Compared with <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> other chronic diseases, <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> diabetes devoted a greater proportion of time to nutrition counseling, health education, and feedback on results and less time to chatting. Compared with <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> acute illness, <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> diabetes were longer and involved...|$|R

40|$|Background: Many suicidal and {{depressed}} patients {{are seen in}} emergency departments (EDs), whereas outpatient <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> depression remain high. Study objective The primary objective {{of the study is}} to determine a relationship between the incidence of suicidal {{and depressed}} patients presenting to EDs and the incidence of depressed patients presenting to outpatient clinics. The secondary objective is to analyze trends among suicidal patients. Methods: The National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were screened to provide a sampling of ED and outpatient visits, respectively. Suicidal and depressed patients presenting to EDs were compared with depressed patients presenting to outpatient clinics. Subgroup analyses included age, sex, race/ethnicity, method of payment, regional variation, and urban verses rural distribution. Results: Emergency department <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> depression (1. 16 % of visits in 2002) and suicide attempts (0. 51 % of visits in 2002) remained stable over the years. Office <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> depression decreased from 3. 14 % of visits in 2002 to 2. 65 % of visits in 2008. Non-Latino whites had a higher percentage of ED <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> depression and suicide attempt and office <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> depression than other groups. The percentage of ED <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> suicide attempt resulting in hospital admission decreased by 2. 06 % per year. Conclusion: From 2002 to 2008, the percentage of outpatient <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> depression decreased, whereas ED <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> depression and suicide remained stable. When examined {{in the context of a}} decreasing prevalence of depression among adults, we conclude that an increasing percentage of the total patients with depression are being evaluated in the ED, vs outpatient clinics. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

5|$|Oryzomys nelsoni was {{collected}} by Edward William Nelson and Edward Goldman in May 1897 and never found again. Their <b>visit</b> <b>for</b> the Biological Survey of the United States Department of Agriculture {{was one of}} the first scientific explorations of the islands. Clinton Hart Merriam identified the mammals they obtained, including four specimens of Oryzomys nelsoni, which were deposited in the United States National Museum and remain there. He named it as a species of the genus Oryzomys, Oryzomys nelsoni; the specific name honors Nelson. Investigators have generally retained it as a species distinct from other Oryzomys, but in 1971 Hershkovitz listed it as one of many subspecies of Oryzomys palustris, which he envisaged as a wide-ranging species encompassing what is now the marsh rice rat (O.palustris) of the southern and eastern United States, O.couesi of Central America, and several other species with more limited distributions.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} AjChan and his {{subsequent}} baptism {{was an important}} diplomatic coup for Ursúa, who used the <b>visit</b> <b>for</b> his own political advancement, promoting the embassy as the peaceful final submission of the Itza kingdom to the Spanish Crown. This formal submission of the Itza kingdom to Spain was a critical turning point, since from a Spanish legal viewpoint the Itza were now subjects and the royal prohibition on military conquest could be sidestepped. AjChan left Mérida with his companions and a Spanish escort {{in the middle of}} January 1696 and arrived back at Tipuj around the end of the month. After a few days at Tipuj he learnt of violent events unfolding around Lake Petén Itzá including the battle at Ch'ich' and the subsequent killing of two Franciscans. Fearing the response of his Spanish escort, he abandoned them and fled back to Yalain.|$|E
5|$|According to anthropologists Richard Gombrich and Gananath Obeyesekere, {{the cult}} of Kali reached Sri Lanka via South India. Although Kali shrines may {{have been part of}} Tamil Hindu temples prior to 12th century CE, the Sinhalese Buddhist {{population}} came to revere Kali as a village demon at least by the 12th century CE. The first known Hindu temple with a shrine to Kali to become popular with the Sinhalese Buddhists is Munneswaram. A myth that has Kali landing at the town of Chilaw, and residing in Munneswaram, has made the temple a popular place of <b>visit</b> <b>for</b> cursing and sorcery purposes. In the early 1970s, the majority of the Sinhalese visitors were there for sorcery purposes, but by the 1990s more than half have been visiting the temple for general veneration purposes, demonstrating the transformation of the deity from a malevolent demigod to a mother goddess. The veneration of Kali has completely overtaken the previously popular veneration of Pattini. Since the 1960s a number of Sinhalese Buddhist shrines dedicated to Kali have sprung up all over the island, especially in urban areas. These are managed by Sinhalese priests who are trance specialists and act as intermediaries between the deity and the devotee while being possessed by the deity. The popular veneration of previously Hindu deities such as Kali and Kataragama deviyo (the latter identified with the Hindu Skanda) have fundamentally altered the rational nature of Theravada Buddhism towards the Bhakti (“Personal veneration of deity”) aspect of Hinduism. Following protests by Buddhist monks and animal rights activist, the government banned the age old custom of animal sacrifices at the Kali temple in 2011.|$|E
40|$|Background Asthma is {{a serious}} global health problem. However, few studies have {{investigated}} the relationship between cold spells and pediatric outpatient <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> asthma. Objective To examine the association between cold spells and pediatric outpatient <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> asthma in Shanghai, China. Methods We collected daily data on pediatric outpatient <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> asthma, mean temperature, relative humidity, and ozone from Shanghai between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2009. We defined cold spells as four or more consecutive days with temperature below the 5 th percentile of temperature during 2007 – 2009. We used a Poisson regression model to {{examine the impact of}} temperature on pediatric outpatient <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> asthma in cold seasons during 2007 and 2009. We examined the effect of cold spells on asthma compared with non-cold spell days. Results There was a significant relationship between cold temperatures and pediatric outpatient <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> asthma. The cold effects on children's asthma were observed at different lags. The lower the temperatures, the higher the risk for asthma attacks among children. Conclusion Cold temperatures, particularly cold spells, significantly increase the risk of pediatric outpatient <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> asthma. The findings suggest that asthma children need to be better protected from cold effects in winter...|$|R

5|$|Johor Bahru {{is one of}} the {{fastest-growing}} cities in Malaysia after Kuala Lumpur. It is the main commercial centre for Johor and is located in the Indonesia–Malaysia–Singapore Growth Triangle. Tertiary-based industry dominates the economy with thousands of Singaporeans and Indonesians and other international tourists visiting the city. It is the centre of financial services, commerce and retail, arts and culture, hospitality, urban tourism, plastic manufacturing, electrical and electronics and food processing. The city has a very close economic relationship with Singapore as many Singaporeans frequently <b>visit</b> <b>for</b> shopping, entertainment, and dining which increase the city income with the stronger Singapore dollar; some Singaporeans have also chosen to live in the city. Due to this, Johor Bahru's retail scene was continuously developed {{to meet the needs of}} its consumers. The main shopping districts are located within the city, with a number of large shopping malls located in the suburbs. A large numbers of the city's residents work in Singapore, where the salaries are higher than in Malaysia. The presence of Singaporean and Chinese-owned companies were also significant, with China being the fifth largest investor in Iskandar Malaysia after Singapore, the United States, Spain and Japan as of September 2014. In 2014, the sudden change of weekend rest days to Friday and Saturday from Saturday and Sunday by the Sultan of Johor had a relatively small impact to the city economy, with business especially affected. However, it boosted the tourism industry as the holidays would be able to start earlier on Sunday, attracting more tourists from Singapore. Johor Bahru is the location of numerous conferences, congress and trade fairs, such as the Eastern Regional Organisation for Planning and Housing and the World Islamic Economic Forum. The city is the first in Malaysia to practise a low-carbon economy.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Particulate air {{pollution}} {{is a mixture}} of solid, liquid, or solid and liquid particles suspended in the air. There have been abundant studies on the short-term effects of {{air pollution}} on health, with emphasis on mortality and hospital admissions. Here we propose to assess the relationship between ambient air pollution, and monthly emergency department (ED) <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> headache. In the present study, the objective was {{to examine the relationship between}} monthly ED <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> headache and selected particulate air pollution factors. Methods: This was a retrospective study of 257 ED <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> headache (ICD- 10 : G 43 and G 44) recorded at Ege University hospital between June 2008 and May 2009 (12 month). Measured air pollutants included sulfur dioxide (SD), suspended particulate matter (PM), and carbon monoxide (CO). Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of particulate air pollution factors. Results: We found no association between outdoor measures of carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and headache visits to ED. Statistically significant positive associations were observed between the number of ED <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> headache and the suspended particulate matter (PM 10), (p= 0. 008 Spearman’s rho). Conclusion: An increase in levels of pm 10 is associated with an increase in the number of ED <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> headache. Presented findings verify that ED <b>visits</b> <b>for</b> headache are correlated to particulate air pollution...|$|R
