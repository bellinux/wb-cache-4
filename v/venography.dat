5|$|Imaging {{tests of}} the veins {{are used in the}} {{diagnosis}} of DVT, most commonly either proximal compression ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound. Each technique has drawbacks: a single proximal scan may miss a distal DVT, while whole-leg scanning can lead to distal DVT overtreatment. Doppler ultrasound, CT scan <b>venography,</b> MRI <b>venography,</b> or MRI of the thrombus are also possibilities.|$|E
5|$|Improvements on the {{diagnosis}} of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in life were made {{with the introduction of}} <b>venography</b> in 1951, which also aided in the distinction from idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which has similar presenting signs and symptoms in many cases.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{standard}} for judging imaging methods is contrast <b>venography,</b> which involves injecting a peripheral vein of the affected limb with a contrast agent and taking X-rays, to reveal whether the venous supply has been obstructed. Because of its cost, invasiveness, availability, and other limitations, this test is rarely performed.|$|E
5|$|An MR venogram is also {{performed}} {{in most cases}} to exclude the possibility of venous sinus stenosis/obstruction or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. A contrast-enhanced MRV (ATECO) scan has a high detection rate for abnormal transverse sinus stenoses. These stenoses can be more adequately identified and assessed with catheter cerebral <b>venography</b> and manometry. Buckling of the bilateral optic nerves with increased perineural fluid is also often noted on MRI imaging.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} <b>venography</b> {{employs the}} same principles, but uses MRI as a scanning modality. MRI {{has the advantage}} of being better at detecting damage to the brain itself {{as a result of the}} increased pressure on the obstructed veins, but it is not readily available in many hospitals and the interpretation may be difficult.|$|E
25|$|It {{is still}} not clear whether {{magnetic}} resonance <b>venography,</b> venous angiography, or Doppler sonography should be considered {{the gold standard for}} the diagnosis of CCSVI. Use of magnetic resonance <b>venography</b> for the diagnosis of CCSVI in MS patients has been proposed by some to have limited value, and should be used only in combination with other techniques. Others have stated that magnetic resonance <b>venography</b> is a valid measure which has advantages over Doppler including the fact that results are more operator-independent.|$|E
25|$|Cerebral {{angiography}} can be performed, {{but it is}} invasive and {{not very}} sensitive. Orbital <b>venography</b> is difficult to perform, but it is excellent in diagnosing occlusion of the cavernous sinus.|$|E
25|$|The main imaging tests {{performed}} {{in order to}} identify renal cell carcinoma are pelvic and abdominal CT scans, ultrasound tests of the kidneys (ultrasonography), MRI scans, intravenous pyelogram (IVP) or renal angiography. Among these main diagnostic tests, other radiologic tests such as excretory urography, positron-emission tomography (PET) scanning, ultrasonography, arteriography, <b>venography,</b> and bone scanning {{can also be used to}} aid in the evaluation of staging renal masses and to differentiate non-malignant tumours from malignant tumours.|$|E
25|$|For hemorrhagic strokes, a CT or MRI scan with {{intravascular}} contrast {{may be able}} {{to identify}} abnormalities in the brain arteries (such as aneurysms) or other sources of bleeding, and structural MRI if this shows no cause. If this too does not identify an underlying reason for the bleeding, invasive cerebral angiography could be performed but this requires access to the bloodstream with an intravascular catheter and can cause further strokes as well as complications at the insertion site and this investigation is therefore reserved for specific situations. If there are symptoms suggesting that the hemorrhage might have occurred as a result of venous thrombosis, CT or MRI <b>venography</b> can be used to examine the cerebral veins.|$|E
500|$|Computed tomography, with radiocontrast in the venous phase (CT <b>venography</b> or CTV), has a {{detection}} {{rate that}} in some regards exceeds that of MRI. The test involves injection into a vein (usually in the arm) of a radioopaque substance, and time is allowed for the bloodstream to carry it to the cerebral veins - {{at which point the}} scan is performed. It has a sensitivity of 75-100% (it detects 75-100% of all clots present), and a specificity of 81-100% (it would be incorrectly positive in 0-19%). In the first two weeks, the [...] "empty delta sign" [...] may be observed (in later stages, this sign may disappear).|$|E
500|$|In a 2002 review, Friedman and Jacobson propose an {{alternative}} set of criteria, derived from Smith's. These require {{the absence of}} symptoms {{that could not be}} explained by a diagnosis of IIH, but do not require the actual presence of any symptoms (such as headache) attributable to IIH. These criteria also require that the lumbar puncture is performed with patient lying sideways, as a lumbar puncture performed in the upright sitting position can lead to artificially high pressure measurements. Friedman and Jacobson also do not insist on MR <b>venography</b> for every patient; rather, this is only required in atypical cases (see [...] "diagnosis" [...] above).|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, a {{case-control study}} found {{evidence}} against {{the involvement of}} chronic cerebrospinal venous abnormalities in MS. Later in 2013 a study found that vein narrowing appears to be present equally in those with and without MS on ultrasound and catheter <b>venography.</b> The {{results of the study}} were described as a [...] "death knell" [...] for Zamboni's theory. Another study released by the University of British Columbia in 2017 was described as a [...] "definitive debunking" [...] of liberation therapy.|$|E
2500|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} angiography (MRA) generates {{pictures of}} the arteries to evaluate them for stenosis (abnormal narrowing) or aneurysms (vessel wall dilatations, at risk of rupture). MRA {{is often used to}} evaluate the arteries of the neck and brain, the thoracic and abdominal aorta, the renal arteries, and the legs (called a [...] "run-off"). A variety of techniques can be used to generate the pictures, such as administration of a paramagnetic contrast agent (gadolinium) or using a technique known as [...] "flow-related enhancement" [...] (e.g., 2D and 3D time-of-flight sequences), where most of the signal on an image is due to blood that recently moved into that plane (see also FLASH MRI). Techniques involving phase accumulation (known as phase contrast angiography) {{can also be used to}} generate flow velocity maps easily and accurately. Magnetic resonance <b>venography</b> (MRV) is a similar procedure that is used to image veins. In this method, the tissue is now excited inferiorly, while the signal is gathered in the plane immediately superior to the excitation planeâ€”thus imaging the venous blood that recently moved from the excited plane.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{diagnostic}} imaging techniques {{are used to}} demonstrate PSS. Ultrasonography is a rapid, convenient, non-invasive, and accurate method for diagnosis of PSS. Ultrasonographic diagnosis of congenital PSS depends on finding an anomalous vessel either in the liver or just caudal to the liver in the dorsal abdomen, usually draining into the caudal vena cava. Ultrasonography {{can also be used}} to estimate hepatic volume and vascularity, and to identify related lesions affecting other abdominal structures, such as urinary calculi. Computed tomography (CT) may be considered when ultrasound expertise is lacking or ultrasonography is considered sub-optimal (e.g. because of the conformation of the patient). Control of respiration and careful timing of CT acquisition after contrast injection is necessary for optimal depiction of PSS. Rectal portal scintigraphy using 99mtechnetium pertechnetate, a technique of imaging involving detection of gamma rays emitted by radionuclides absorbed through the rectum and into the bloodstream, demonstrates the blood vessel bypassing the liver. [...] In certain institutions, scintigraphy is the preferred diagnostic technique, but this leaves the patient radioactive for 24h, which may be inconvenient depending on nursing needs. Portal <b>venography</b> is the definitive method for demonstrating PSS, but is invasive, hence it is best reserved for animals with a known shunt or those considered highly likely to have a shunt that was not detectable by ultrasonography.|$|E
50|$|It {{is still}} not clear whether {{magnetic}} resonance <b>venography,</b> venous angiography, or Doppler sonography should be considered {{the gold standard for}} the diagnosis of CCSVI. Use of magnetic resonance <b>venography</b> for the diagnosis of CCSVI in MS patients has been proposed by some to have limited value, and should be used only in combination with other techniques.

50|$|Imaging {{tests of}} the veins {{are used in the}} {{diagnosis}} of DVT, most commonly either proximal compression ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound.

Doppler ultrasound, CT scan <b>venography,</b> MRI <b>venography,</b> or MRI of the thrombus are also possibilities.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>venography</b> procedure, {{the groin}} is the {{preferred}} site for incisions to enter a catheter into the vascular system.|$|E
50|$|Arthrography and <b>venography</b> using imaging dyes {{allow for}} the {{detection}} of popliteal cysts and the exclusion of thrombotic lesions but are invasive procedures.|$|E
5000|$|Angiography {{throughout}} the cardiovascular system, including cerebral and peripheral arteriography, coronary arteriography and ventriculography, pediatric angiocardiography, selective visceral arteriography and aortography, peripheral <b>venography</b> (phlebography) ...|$|E
50|$|In this condition, imaging {{modalities}} often indicated {{include the}} use of Doppler and non-Doppler ultrasound, arthrography, <b>venography</b> magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerised axial tomography (CAT scan).|$|E
50|$|Contrast <b>venography</b> is {{the gold}} {{standard}} for judging diagnostic imaging methods for deep venous thrombosis; although, because of its cost, invasiveness, and other limitations this test is rarely performed.|$|E
50|$|Although Angiography and <b>Venography</b> {{which both}} use X-ray and {{contrast}} injection material are {{more accurate than}} Doppler Sonography, Doppler Sonography may be chosen because it is faster, less expensive, and non-invasive.|$|E
50|$|BOLD <b>venography</b> or {{susceptibility}} weighted imaging (SWI): This method exploits the susceptibility {{differences between}} tissues {{and uses the}} phase image to detect these differences. The magnitude and phase data are combined (digitally, by an image-processing program) to produce an enhanced contrast magnitude image which is exquisitely sensitive to venous blood, hemorrhage and iron storage. The imaging of venous blood with SWI is a blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) technique {{which is why it}} was (and is sometimes still) referred to as BOLD <b>venography.</b> Due to its sensitivity to venous blood SWI is commonly used in traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and for high resolution brain venographies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Venography</b> {{can also}} be used to {{distinguish}} blood clots from obstructions in the veins, to evaluate congenital vein problems, to see how the deep leg vein valves are working, or to identify a vein for arterial bypass grafting.|$|E

50|$|Management of the {{underlying}} defect {{is proportional to the}} severity of the clinical presentation. Leg swelling and pain is best evaluated by vascular specialists (vascular surgeons, interventional cardiologists, interventional radiologists) who both diagnose and treat arterial and venous diseases to ensure that the cause of the extremity pain is evaluated. The diagnosis needs to be confirmed with some sort of imaging that may include magnetic resonance <b>venography,</b> venogram and usually confirmed with intravascular ultrasound because the flattened vein may not be noticed on conventional <b>venography.</b> In order to prevent prolonged swelling or pain from the consequences of the backed up blood from the compressed iliac vein, flow needs to be improved out of the leg. Uncomplicated cases may be managed with compression stockings.|$|E
50|$|Venograms {{can help}} {{determine}} the prognosis for the animal, particularly in horses where the degree of pain does not match the radiographic changes. In <b>venography,</b> a contrast agent, visible on radiographs, is injected into the palmar digital vein to delineate the vasculature of the foot. The venogram can assess the severity and location of tissue compromise and monitor effectiveness of the current therapy. Compression of veins within the hoof {{will be seen as}} sections that do not contain contrast material. Poor or improper blood flow to different regions of the hoof {{help determine the}} severity of the laminitic episode. <b>Venography</b> is especially useful for early detection of support limb laminitis, as changes will be seen on venograph (and MRI) within 1-2 weeks, whereas clinical signs and radiographic changes do not manifest until 4-6 weeks.|$|E

50|$|Technetium 99mTc macro {{aggregated}} albumin (99mTc-MAA) is an injectable radiopharmaceutical used {{in nuclear}} medicine. It {{consists of a}} sterile aqueous suspension of Technetium-99m (99mTc) labeled to human albumin aggregate particles. It is commonly used for lung perfusion scanning. It is also less commonly used to visualise a peritoneovenous shunt and for isotope <b>venography.</b>|$|E
50|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} <b>venography</b> {{employs the}} same principles, but uses MRI as a scanning modality. MRI {{has the advantage}} of being better at detecting damage to the brain itself {{as a result of the}} increased pressure on the obstructed veins, but it is not readily available in many hospitals and the interpretation may be difficult.|$|E
50|$|Impedance phlebography, or {{impedance}} plethysmography (IPG), is a non-invasive {{medical test}} that measures {{small changes in}} electrical resistance of the chest, calf or {{other regions of the}} body. These measurements reflect blood volume changes, and can indirectly indicate {{the presence or absence of}} venous thrombosis. This procedure provides an alternative to <b>venography,</b> which is invasive and requires a great deal of skill to execute adequately and interpret accurately.|$|E
50|$|An MR venogram is also {{performed}} {{in most cases}} to exclude the possibility of venous sinus stenosis/obstruction or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. A contrast-enhanced MRV (ATECO) scan has a high detection rate for abnormal transverse sinus stenoses. These stenoses can be more adequately identified and assessed with catheter cerebral <b>venography</b> and manometry. Buckling of the bilateral optic nerves with increased perineural fluid is also often noted on MRI imaging.|$|E
50|$|<b>Venography</b> (also called {{phlebography}} or ascending phlebography) is {{a procedure}} {{in which an}} x-ray of the veins, a venogram, is taken after a special dye is injected into the bone marrow or veins. The dye has to be injected constantly via a catheter, making it an invasive procedure. Normally the catheter is inserted by the groin {{and moved to the}} appropriate site by navigating through the vascular system.|$|E

5000|$|May-Thurner {{syndrome}} in {{the broader}} disease profile known as nonthrombotic iliac vein lesions (NIVLs) exists in the symptomatic ambulatory patient and these lesions are usually not seen by <b>venography.</b> Morphologically, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) {{has emerged as the}} best current tool {{in the broader}} sense. [...] Functional testing such as duplex ultrasound, venous and interstitial pressure measurement and plethysmography may sometimes be beneficial. Compression of the left common iliac vein may be seen on pelvic CT.|$|E
