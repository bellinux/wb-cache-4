40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a region-of-interest visual hull refinement technique, based on flexible voxel grids for volumetric <b>visual</b> hull <b>reconstructions.</b> Region-of-interest refinement {{is based on}} a multipass process, beginning with a focussed <b>visual</b> hull <b>reconstruction,</b> resulting in a first 3 D approximation of the target, followed by a region-of-interest estimation, tasked with identifying features of interest, which in turn are used to locally refine the voxel grid and extract a higher-resolution surface representation for those regions. This approach is illustrated for the reconstruction of avatars for use in tele-immersion environments, where head and hand regions are of higher interest. To allow reproducability and direct comparison a publicly available data set for human <b>visual</b> hull <b>reconstruction</b> is used. This paper shows that region-of-interest reconstruction of the target is faster and visually comparable to higher resolution focused <b>visual</b> hull <b>reconstructions.</b> This approach reduces the amount of data generated through the reconstruction, allowing faster post processing, as rendering or networking of the surface voxels. Reconstruction speeds support smooth interactions between the avatar and the virtual environment, while the improved resolution of its facial region and hands creates a higher-degree of immersion and potentially impacts the perception of body language, facial expressions and eye-to-eye contact.

5000|$|The Marktsackpfeife (or [...] "German bagpipe") is a <b>visual</b> <b>reconstruction</b> {{of medieval}} {{bagpipes}} after descriptions by Michael Praetorius and depictions by Albrecht Dürer {{as well as}} numerous medieval depictions. While the exterior is reconstructed from these sources, the interior has its own distinct characteristics: GHB, Bombard and own ideas has been merged into a new design by pipe makers Klaus Stecker and Roman Streisand in the early 1980s creating a modern bagpipe with no historical counterparts. [...] "Medieval Pipes" [...] is thus a misnomer, since no actual bagpipes from Middle Ages have survived. The sound is often similar to the Scottish Great Highland Bagpipe, due to {{the widespread use of}} GHB-reeds, although own reeds (Arundo donax, PE and PS) are also used by pipe makers. The main distinction between Hingland Pipes and Marktsackpfeife lies in its internal bore - GHB features a conical bore with a linear profle, while the other one often possess a slightly parabolic non-parallel bore, which often results in a sound somehow similar to an oriental Zurna. Commonly tuned in A-Dorian/A minor it is pitched in a' 440Hz and used by musical groups specialising in medieval tunes. Often to be seen at medieval festivals and markets.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Compressive sensing (CS) {{makes it}} {{possible}} to more naturally create compact representations of data with respect to a desired data rate. Through wavelet decomposition, smooth and piecewise smooth signals can be represented as sparse and compressible coefficients. These coefficients can then be effec-tively compressed via the CS. Since a wavelet transform divides image information into layered blockwise wavelet coefficients over spatial and frequency domains, visual improvement can be attained by an appropriate perceptually weighted CS scheme. We introduce such a method in this paper and compare it with the conventional CS. The resulting visual CS model is shown to deliver improved <b>visual</b> <b>reconstructions.</b> Index Terms — Compressive sensing (CS), modified block compressive sensing, visual compressive sensing, wavelet trans-form, weighted compressive sampling matching pursuit.

Surprisingly, most algorithms do not exploit gauge freedoms to improve performances. We consider this issue. We analyze theoretically {{the impact of the}} gauge on standard algorithms. We show that a sufficiently general damping matrix in Levenberg-Marquardt iteration can be used to implicitly reproduce a gauge transformation.

Zisserman, <b>Visual</b> <b>Reconstruction,</b> MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1987). <b>Visual</b> <b>reconstruction</b> problems are commonly formulated in an optimization framework and normally require the optimization of nonconvex functions especially when discontinuity preserving image/shape recovery is the goal. Example problems include, image restoration, surface reconstruction, shape from shading etc. Most existing deterministic methods fail {{to reach the}} global optimum and lack the generality to incorporate reasonably complex interactions between boolean valued line process variables used for representing the presence (absence) of discontinuities. Stochastic methods for solving such problems e. g. the simulated annealing algorithm or variants thereof do achieve a global optimum but are plagued by slow convergence rates. In this paper, we present a new hybrid search algorithm as an efficient solution for achieving the global optimum of the nonconvex function derived from a Markov random field formulation which allows for incorporation of complex interactions between the line process variables to better constraint the line processes. In the hybrid search, for the stochastic part, we develop an informed genetic algorithm (GA) while employing an incomplete Cholesky preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm ([23]; S. H. Lai and B.

This thesis explores {{some of the}} <b>visual</b> <b>reconstruction</b> and classification algorithms for 3 D microstructures used in micromanipulation. Mechanical characterization of microstructures has also been considered. In particular, <b>visual</b> <b>reconstruction</b> algorithm (shape from focus - SFF) uses 2 D image sequence of a microscopic object captured at different focusing levels to create a 3 D range image. Then, the visual classification algorithm takes the range image as an input and applies a curvature-based segmentation method, HK segmentation, {{which is based on}} differential geometry. The object is segmented into surface patches according to the curvature of its surface. It is shown that the <b>visual</b> <b>reconstruction</b> algorithm works successfully for synthetic and real image data. The range images are used to classify the surfaces of the micro objects according to their curvatures in the HK segmentation algorithm.

We show how {{the use of a}} class-specific prior in a <b>visual</b> hull <b>reconstruction</b> can reduce the effect of segmentation errors from the silhouette extraction process. The proposed method is applied to a data set of pedestrian images, and improvements in the approximate 3 D models under various noise conditions are shown.

Model matching and parameter inference are done entirely in the image domain and require no explicit 3 D construction. Our shape model enables accurate estimation of structure despite segmentation errors or missing views in the input silhouettes, and works even with only a single input view.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{an extension of}} the single-frame <b>visual</b> field <b>reconstruction</b> problem in which we consider how to efficiently and optimally fuse multiple frames of measurements obtained from images arriving sequentially over time. Specifically we extend the notion of spatial coherence constraints, used to regularize single-frame problems, to the time axis yielding temporal coherence constraints. An information form variant of the Kalman filter is presented which yields the optimal maximum likelihood estimate of the field at each time instant and is tailored to the <b>visual</b> field <b>reconstruction</b> problem. Propagation and even storage of the optimal information matrices for visual problems is prohibitive, however, since their size is on the order of 104 x 104 to 106 x 106. To cope with this dimensionality problem a practical yet near-optimal filter is presented. The key to this solution is the observation that the information matrix, i. e. the inverse of the covariance matrix, of a vector of samples of a spatially distributed process may be precisely interpreted as specifying a Markov random field model for the estimation error process. This insight leads directly to the idea of obtaining low-order approximate models for the estimation error in a recursive filter through the recursive approximation of the information matrix by an appropriate sparse, spatially localized matrix. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed filter and approximations...|$|R
