40|$|Global trade lanes rely on {{shipping}} companies and operators to transport their goods. This {{may be changing}} as producers increase their control in downstream logistics. We examine how the flow of pulp from Brasilia to main markets in Europe has evolved, and how the roles of producers, ship operators and distributors in the value chain have changed {{and will continue to}} develop. By using an in-depth case study, we show some disruptive changes in the structure and operations of the concerned supply chain. The case company signed a long-term contract with a shipbuilder and operator company to transport its total export volume of wood pulp. Thus, the pulp producer's dedicated fleet enables a move from fluctuating, unreliable pulp shipments towards pre-scheduled, accurate deliveries to destinations within close proximity of the pulp customers' sites. Moreover, the pulp producer under study has also agreed with its key overseas customers that <b>vendor</b> <b>managed</b> <b>inventories</b> (<b>VMIs)</b> will be implemented on a global scale to reduce inventories across the supply chain and improve customer service.
