40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} recent {{progress in the}} development of a thin <b>vacuum-fluorescent</b> <b>display</b> utilizing a matrix-addressable array of groups of Spindt-type field-emission cathodes 1, 2. The array consists of a matrix having 100 lines/inch in one direction and 300 lines/inch in the other. Each picture element (pixel) in the matrix is made up of an array of emitter tips sharing a common, individually addressable base electrode (one of the 100 lines) and three separately addressable control or gate electrodes in the orthogonal direction (one for each of the basic colors : red, green, blue). Each color element has about 100 emitter tips. The current emitted from the array is averaged over the 100 tips, and good uniformity of emission from color element to color element and pixel to pixel can be obtained, because of the averaging effect...|$|E

5000|$|In 1969, the Scientific research, {{study and}} design {{institute}} for electronic calculators was founded {{specifically for the}} design of calculators. In 1972 this developed the lighter and more portable, but still relatively large calculator models ELKA 40 and ELKA 42 built around integrated circuits (medium-scale integration). These had again nixie tube displays. Later models in the 1970s were the ELKA 50 and ELKA 1300, which had a similar outward appearance and used <b>vacuum-fluorescent</b> tube <b>displays</b> and relatively expensive but very relyable reed-switch keyboards. Meanwhile, the ELKA 77 was the first electronic cash register.|$|R
