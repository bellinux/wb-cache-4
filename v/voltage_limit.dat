50|$|Historically, {{the first}} accelerators used simple {{technology}} {{of a single}} static high voltage to accelerate charged particles. The charged particle was accelerated through an evacuated tube with an electrode at either end, with the static potential across it. Since the particle passed only once through the potential difference, the output energy {{was limited to the}} accelerating voltage of the machine. While this method is still extremely popular today, with the electrostatic accelerators greatly out-numbering any other type, they are more suited to lower energy studies owing to the practical <b>voltage</b> <b>limit</b> of about 1 MV for air insulated machines, or 30 MV when the accelerator is operated in a tank of pressurized gas with high dielectric strength, such as sulfur hexafluoride. In a tandem accelerator the potential is used twice to accelerate the particles, by reversing the charge of the particles while they are inside the terminal. This is possible with the acceleration of atomic nuclei by using anions (negatively charged ions), and then passing the beam through a thin foil to strip electrons off the anions inside the high voltage terminal, converting them to cations (positively charged ions), which are accelerated again as they leave the terminal.|$|E

40|$|Independently {{controlled}} multimotor drives {{are typically}} realized {{by using a}} common dc link and independent sets of three-phase inverters and motors. In {{the case of an}} open-circuit fault in an inverter leg, one motor becomes single phase. To enable continued controllable operation by eliminating single phasing, the supply for the motor phase with the faulted inverter leg can be paralleled to a healthy leg of another inverter using hardware reconfiguration. Hence, the two motors are now supplied from a five-leg inverter, which has inherent voltage and current limitations. Theoretically, violating the <b>voltage</b> <b>limit</b> leads to inverter overmodulation and large torque oscillations. It is shown here that the finite-control-set model predictive control, designed to control the machines' stator flux and torque, can consider the inherent <b>voltage</b> <b>limit</b> dynamically in the control loop. Apart from preserving the independent control of the two machines, the additional constraint consideration significantly widens the operating speed ranges of the machines.

The obtained performance is illustrated using experimental results and is also compared to the conventional two-motor field-oriented control scheme.
