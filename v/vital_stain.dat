40|$|Background The correct {{evaluation}} of mineralization is fundamental {{for the study}} of skeletal development, maintenance, and regeneration. Current methods to visualize mineralized tissue in zebrafish rely on: 1) fixed specimens; 2) radiographic and μCT techniques, that are ultimately limited in resolution; or 3) <b>vital</b> <b>stains</b> with fluorochromes that are indistinguishable from the signal of green fluorescent protein (GFP) -labelled cells. Alizarin compounds, either in the form of alizarin red S (ARS) or alizarin complexone (ALC), have long been used to stain the mineralized skeleton in fixed specimens from all vertebrate groups. Recent works have used ARS <b>vital</b> <b>staining</b> in zebrafish and medaka, yet not based on consistent protocols. There is a fundamental concern on whether ARS <b>vital</b> <b>staining,</b> achieved by adding ARS to the water, can affect bone formation in juvenile and adult zebrafish, as ARS has been shown to inhibit skeletal growth and mineralization in mammals. Results Here we present a protocol for <b>vital</b> <b>staining</b> of mineralized structures in zebrafish with a low ARS concentration that does not affect bone mineralization, even after repetitive ARS staining events, as confirmed by careful imaging under fluorescent light. Early and late stages of bone development are equally unaffected by this <b>vital</b> <b>staining</b> protocol. From all tested concentrations, 0. 01  % ARS yielded correct detection of bone calcium deposits without inducing additional stress to fish. Conclusions The proposed ARS <b>vital</b> <b>staining</b> protocol can be combined with GFP fluorescence associated with skeletal tissues and thus represents a powerful tool for in vivo monitoring of mineralized structures. We provide examples from wild type and transgenic GFP-expressing zebrafish, for endoskeletal development and dermal fin ray regeneration...|$|R
40|$|By {{adding the}} serum of {{patients}} with varicus blocd diseases to the medium of bone-marrow tissue culture of rabbits, the author studied mainly its influence on the <b>vital</b> <b>staining</b> of pseudoeosinophils with neutral red. At {{the same time the}} author pursued <b>vital</b> <b>staining</b> of neutrophils in the bone marrow of the sternum from the same patients with neutral red; and as for the verification of the study, the cells that had been cultured for several hours were vitally stained. As the result the author arrived at the following conclusions: 1. When the cell functions (wandering velocity and carbon-particle phagocytosis) are low during the tissue culture, <b>vital</b> <b>staining</b> by neutral red takes place fast and highly but the stained color fades quickly. 2. Also when the <b>vital</b> <b>staining</b> is done after fixed intervals of culture, the longer the time of culture is, namely, at the time when the cell functions are further diminished, the more prompt and the higher is the staining and also the fading takes place more quickly. 3. Those patients showing lowered cell functions on the <b>vital</b> <b>staining</b> of bone marrow are aplastic anemia, Banti's disease, leukemia, acute bleeding anemia and kala-azar. 4. Likewise those who show a slight lowering in the cell functions are ancylostomiasis, essential hypochromic anemia and Werlhof's disease; and those whose functions are hardly lowered are those patients suffering from lung tuberculosis and malignant nephrosclerosis, namely, not from blood diseasses. 5. On <b>vital</b> <b>staining</b> the sera that possess factors of lowering the functions of bone marrow are those of aplastic anemia, Banti's disease, acute bleeding anemia, Werlhof's disease, and leukemia...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that a region of {{epithelial}} dysplasia cannot easily be distinguished macroscopically from normal looking area surrounding early oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In 1953, Slaughter emphasized field cancerization {{and the importance of}} examining the fields surrounding OSCC. Since 1997, we have used <b>vital</b> <b>staining</b> with iodine for detecting surgical margin and investigated the usefulness of this method. From a pathological point of view, various types of dysplasia in iodine unstained area (IU) surrounding OSCC was found. In oral mucosa, iodine–glycogen reaction does not occur in dysplastic mucosa {{due to the lack of}} glycogen granules in the cytoplasm of those cells. This area has high positive PCNA and p 53 cells with malignant potentiality. More recently, since 2010, we have used fluorescence visualization (FV) with <b>vital</b> <b>staining</b> with iodine. This device can visualize epithelial dysplasia surrounding OSCC as fluorescence visualization loss (FVL). FVL has high positive Ki- 67 and p 53 cells with malignant potentiality. We suggest that FV has delineated various types of dysplasia and the delineation of surgical margin is the same or better than <b>vital</b> <b>staining</b> with iodine.

5000|$|A <b>vital</b> <b>stain</b> in {{a casual}} usage may mean a stain {{that can be}} applied on living cells without killing them. Vital stains have been useful for {{diagnostic}} and surgical techniques in a variety of medical specialties. In supravital staining living cells that have been removed from an organism, whereas intravital staining is done by injecting or otherwise introducing the stain into the body. The term <b>vital</b> <b>stain</b> is used by some authors to refer to an intravital stain, and by others interchangeably with a supravital stain, the core concept being that the cell being examined is still alive. But in a more strict sense the term vital staining has a meaning contrasting with supravital staining. While in supravital staining the live cells take up the stain, in [...] "vital staining" [...] - the most accepted but apparently paradoxical meaning of this term, the live cells exclude the stain i.e. stain negatively and only the dead cells stain positively and thus viability can be assessed by counting the percentage of total cells that stain negatively. Very bulky or highly charged stains that don't cross live plasma membrane are used as vital stains and supravital stains are those that are either small or are pumped actively into live cells. Since supravital and intravital nature of the staining depends on the dye, a combination of supravital and vital dyes can also be used in a sophisticated way to better classify cells into distinct subsets (e.g. viable, dead, dying etc.).|$|E

40|$|AbstractAcacia mearnsii (black wattle) is {{a commercially}} {{important}} forestry species in South Africa, grown for its timber {{as well as}} its bark. It is, however, also considered to be an alien invader of indigenous vegetation and for this reason the production of a sterile variety would be highly desirable for commercial forestry in South Africa. Previous research on crosses between diploid and tetraploid parent plants to produce triploid progeny has resulted in poor seed set. One possible barrier preventing seed set could be the viability of the pollen used in the cross pollination operations. Thus a study was conducted to test the pollen viability. In vitro agar media germination tests (ACIAR and Brewbaker and Kwack media) were optimised on Acacia podalyriifolia pollen and then used together with <b>vital</b> <b>stain</b> tests (Sigma® DAB peroxidase and p-phenylendiamine) to test pollen germination and viability of A. mearnsii pollen.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effectiveness}} of <b>vital</b> <b>stains</b> {{to assess the}} viability of hookworm eggs depends on the permeability of eggshells. The eggshells may not be permeable immediately after inactivation, and {{this can lead to}} over-estimation of viable eggs in a sample. In this study, heat-inactivated eggs of hookworm (Ancylostoma caninum) were used to evaluate the time required for eggshells to become permeable to three <b>vital</b> <b>stains</b> (eosin Y, methyl red, and methylene blue). The results of this study showed that heat-inactivated eggs incubated for 1 h at room temperature (24 ± 1 °C) contain 32 – 53 % non-viable eggs or permeable eggshells. The numbers of non-viable eggs increased to 88 – 94 % after 6 h of incubation. The accurate viability assessment was achieved after 12 h of incubation at room temperature. <b>Vital</b> <b>stains</b> did not play a significant (P> 0. 05) role in reducing the false viability. This study provides information that can aid in the accurate detection of viable hookworm eggs from environmental samples comprised of mixed populations that are viable and non-viable with permeable or impermeable eggshells...|$|R
40|$|Murine natural killer (NK) {{cells have}} been shown to bind to and inhibit the growth of Cryptococcus neoformans in vitro and to {{contribute}} to clearance of the organism in vivo. However, it is unclear whether NK cells actually kill cryptococci or simply inhibit proliferation of the fungal target. Therefore, the studies presented here were designed to determine whether NK cells are fungicidal to C. neoformans targets. C. neoformans viability was determined {{on the basis of the}} metabolic function of two different enzyme systems, as measured by the two <b>vital</b> <b>stains</b> MTT [3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide] and fluorescein diacetate. Cryptococcal viability, as determined by <b>vital</b> <b>stains,</b> was compared with cryptococcal proliferation, as measured by microcolony formation in agarose at the individual cell level and by CFU counts or extinction dilution analysis in the total cell suspension. Initial comparisons of the <b>vital</b> <b>stains</b> and proliferation assays indicated that these methods effectively distinguished between live and heat-killed cryptococci at the individual cell level and in the total cell suspensions. After cryptococci were incubated with murine NK cells for 18 h, <b>vital</b> <b>stains</b> demonstrated that at the single conjugate level and in the total cell suspension, NK cells kill bound C. neoformans target cells. In addition, the numbers of dead cryptococci in the NK cell-C. neoformans suspensions as determined by the <b>vital</b> <b>stains</b> were comparable to the numbers of cryptococci that were unable to proliferate. Kinetics of NK cell-mediated C. neoformans binding and killing at the single conjugate level and in the total cell suspension were assessed by MTT staining at 2 -h intervals after mixing effector and target cells, and the data support the concept that NK cell-C. neoformans binding precedes cryptococcal death. Furthermore, unbound, dead fungal cells were observed in the NK cell-C. neoformans suspensions after 18 h, suggesting that NK cell-C. neoformans interactions may involve both effector cell recycling and killing of unbound cryptococci by soluble cytotoxic factors. In conclusion, the results of these studies firmly establish that NK cells kill C. neoformans...|$|R
