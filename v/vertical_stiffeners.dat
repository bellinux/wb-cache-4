Stresses on the flanges near the centre of the span are greater than {{near the end of the}} span, so the top and bottom flange plates are frequently reinforced in the middle portion of the span. <b>Vertical</b> <b>stiffeners</b> prevent the web plate from buckling under shear stresses.

40|$|The brittle {{fracture}} of the Hoan Bridge in December 2000 highlighted the fracture susceptibility of details containing intersecting welds in steel bridges. Though {{it is now}} known that details with intersecting welds should be avoided, many existing bridges in Indiana contain details with intersecting welds. Little experimental data on the fatigue performance of these details exists. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the fatigue strength of several details commonly found in steel bridges in Indiana that contain intersecting welds. Large-scale experimental fatigue testing were performed using nine steel beams to study the behavior of three basic types of welded details: a <b>vertical</b> <b>stiffener,</b> a horizontal stiffener terminating near a <b>vertical</b> <b>stiffener,</b> and a horizontal gusset plate coped to fit around a <b>vertical</b> <b>stiffener.</b> The welded details in this study were fabricated with varying degrees of web gap, defined as the distance between perpendicular weld toes. The results of the experimental testing were examined and compared to prior testing to determine if the size of the web gap affected the fatigue strength. Furthermore, the performance of drilled hole retrofits used to extend the fatigue life of these details was studied. Within the scope of the fatigue testing program, the presence of intersecting welds was not found to significantly affect the fatigue strength of <b>vertical</b> <b>stiffener</b> and horizontal gusset details. However, the size of the web gap may have had an effect on the fatigue strength of details where a horizontal stiffener terminated near a <b>vertical</b> <b>stiffener.</b> Further experimental testing is needed to more clearly define the relationship between web gap and fatigue strength for this case. Drilled hole retrofits were successful at prolonging the lives of these details to varying degrees, but it should be noted that the stress redistribution resulting from these holes may cause fatigue cracking at nearby weld toes...|$|R

40|$|Coping of beams {{is usually}} done {{in order to}} allow for {{clearance}} at connections, but doing so reduces the beams strength and makes it susceptible to local web buckling at the coped section. Due to this reduction of the beam's strength, it was of interest to reinforce the web at the coped end. Previous researchers have proposed several design recommendations for reinforcement of coped beams. Possible measures involves welding on endplates or use of bolted connections at the coped end, and provision of stiffeners at the coped region. In this thesis a numerical study on the coped beam's strength and behaviour is presented. Nonlinear finite element analyses have been conducted to predict the structural behaviour and capacities of coped beams with varying cope dimensions. The beam was strengthened by either restraining the coped end from lateral translation or by provision of stiffeners at the coped region. The effect of restraining the coped end depended on the cope dimensions. For cope length-to-reduced beam hight ratios lesser than 1 (c/h_ 0 = 1), the effect was negligible. Reinforcement in longitudinal direction only did not prevent the occurence of local web buckling, so that the recommended reinforcement details of the coped beam included a combination of stiffeners in both vertical and longitudinal direction for which the beam was able to develop the plastic moment capacity of the full beam section without any significant sideways rigid body movement of the longitudinal stiffeners. The proposed design recommendations considers the webs slenderness and coped dimensions. For coped beams with web depth-to-thickness ratios (h_w/t_w) {{less than or equal to}} 58 and cope length-to-reduced web hight ratios (c/h_ 0) less than one, longitudinal and <b>vertical</b> <b>stiffeners</b> were required while double <b>vertical</b> <b>stiffeners</b> were required for cope ratios equal to or more than 1.

40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} study of inelastic lateral torsional buckling of coped beams with simply supported ends is presented in this paper. Six full scale coped steel I-beam tests were conducted. The test parameters include the aspect ratio of cope length to beam depth at coped region {{as well as the}} ratio of cope depth to beam depth. The results of tests were compared with finite element model results. The test results showed that a reduction in the inelastic buckling load due to coping could reach more than 60 % of the uncoped buckling capacity. A group of twelve finite element models for steel coped beams are investigated. The study takes into consideration variable parameters such as cope depth and length. A comparison between uncoped models and models with different geometrical parameters, is performed. The finite element results showed that both the cope length and cope depth have a significant influence on the lateral torsional buckling capacity.

40|$|The shear {{buckling}} {{failure and}} strength of a web panel stiffened by stiffeners with corrosion damage were examined according {{to the degree of}} corrosion of the stiffeners, using the finite element analysis method. For this purpose, a plate girder with a four-panel web girder stiffened by <b>vertical</b> and longitudinal <b>stiffeners</b> was selected, and its deformable behaviors and the principal stress distribution of the web panel at the shear buckling strength of the web were compared after their post-shear buckling behaviors, as well as their out-of-plane displacement, to evaluate the effect of the stiffener in the web panel on the shear buckling failure. Their critical shear buckling load and shear buckling strength were also examined. The FE analyses showed that their typical shear buckling failures were affected by the structural relationship between the web panel and each stiffener in the plate girder, to resist shear buckling of the web panel. Their critical shear buckling loads decreased from 82 % to 59 %, and their shear buckling strength decreased from 88 % to 76 %, due to the effect of corrosion of the stiffeners on their shear buckling behavior.

Cleats connecting the <b>vertical</b> <b>stiffener</b> and horizontal base panel to T-shaped sandwich joints were reinforced in the through-thickness direction with pins.

The peak fracture load and fracture energy increased with the volume content of z-pins. The strengthening and toughening effect of the pins was analysed using multiple pin pull-out tests performed on the sandwich composite material.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel Lamb wave line sensing {{technique}} for crack detection in a welded stiffener. The proposed technique overcomes {{one of the}} biggest technical challenges of Lamb wave crack detection for real structure applications: crack-induced Lamb waves are often mixed with multiple reflections from complex waveguides. In particular, crack detection in a welded joint, one of the structural hot spots due to stress concentration, is accompanied by reflections from the welded joint as well as a crack. Extracting and highlighting crack-induced Lamb wave modes from Lamb wave responses measured at multi-spatial points along a single line can be accomplished through a frequency-wavenumber domain analysis. The advantages of the proposed technique enable us not only to enhance the crack detectability in the welded joint but also to minimize false alarms caused by environmental and operational variations by avoiding the direct comparison with the baseline data previously accumulated from the pristine condition of a target structure. The proposed technique is experimentally and numerically validated in vertically stiffened metallic structures, revealing that it successfully identifies and localizes subsurface cracks, regardless of the coexistence with the <b>vertical</b> <b>stiffener.</b> open 0...|$|R

The buckling length coefficients specified in the current standards and specifications were firstly defined by Nethercot (1973) [1], and cover only doubly symmetric I-sections. The elastic and inelastic behavior of overhanging singly-symmetric floor beams subjected to concentrated load at cantilever tip is investigated in this paper, using the finite element method. To this purpose, a geometrically and materially non-linear finite element model is built. A parametric study is performed considering the effect of mono-symmetric ratio, the un-supported length to the radius of gyration for lateral-torsional buckling ratio, and different boundary conditions at root support and cantilever tip on the ultimate moment capacity of the overhanging beams.

Cracks can easily form in a shear panel damper when the panel undergoes shear buckling during cyclic loading caused by a severe earthquake. The damper's plastic deformation capacity can be enhanced by installing several <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>stiffeners</b> on the panel. Plastic deformation capacity means the amplitude of cyclic deformation angle under which the damper's strength keeps its designed yield strength. Overall shear buckling of the panel causes sudden deterioration of the damper's strength. Hence, overall shear buckling in a panel must be prevented {{to ensure that the}} shear panel damper maintains its yield strength up to an assumed deformation angle. Chusilp and Usami proposed an optimum stiffener flexural rigidity ratio, which defines the stiffener's sectional properties in which subpanels divided by stiffeners reach shear buckling before the panel undergoes overall shear buckling. However, the terms of the Fourier series in the Rayleigh-Ritz method were 6 x 6, and the accuracy of the plate buckling coefficient is not satisfactory. The torsional rigidity of the stiffener is not taken into account in the analysis. Application conditions are restricted so that the <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>stiffeners</b> must be the same.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper was initiated by recent efforts to use circumferential creeping waves for ultrasonic nondestructive testing of inaccessible airframe structures for fatigue cracking. One particular such application of great interest in the aerospace industry is the inspection of weep holes drilled through <b>vertical</b> <b>stiffeners</b> in wet-wing structures (used as fuel tanks) of both military and civilian aircraft in order to permit remnant fuel to be evenly distributed during flight. Unfortunately, they can become the sites from which fatigue cracks often originate. A new split-aperture technique was recently suggested for the inspection of these holes [1]. The outstanding sensitivity of the split-aperture circumferential creeping wave technique in dry weep holes was well demonstrated on both simulated and real fatigue cracks. However, the presence of fuel or even its residues in the weep hole significantly affects the behavior of the circumferential creeping wave. It causes the creeping wave echo to split into a rather weak Rayleigh-type surface wave signal and a much stronger but somewhat slower halo signal [2].

Tests {{on a large}} scale steel model silo with a pyramidal hopper showed that the stress state of the stored material is significantly influenced by the wall flexibility and boundary conditions. The measured wall pressures were very different to pressures predicted by traditional theories and existing design codes.

In this thesis the results of tests to measure the stress state throughout the contents of a flexible silo and pyramidal hopper are presented and compared with measurements of the structural response.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{monotonic}} and cyclic finite element (FE) analyses are presented {{for the development}} of an I-beam-to-CHS column steel moment joint for seismic actions. The development process for the final joint details includes: (1) eliminating two identified structural deficiencies of distortion in column web panel and strain concentrations in the external diaphragms; (2) creating a multi-fuse energy dissipation mechanism; (3) devising a joint to delay onset of beam yielding. Two external diaphragm collar plates are welded to the circumference of the CHS column for connection to beam flanges. Various collar ring widths are examined for these horizontal diaphragms and a width (based on achieving full strength of the beam flanges) is found to produce an acceptable web panel performance. Different types of stiffener geometries in the connection region are then trialed to eliminate strain concentrations in the diaphragms. Two pairs of triangular diaphragm stiffeners are found to provide the desired performance. In order to produce a multi-fuse energy dissipation mechanism, tapered cover plates (TCPs) equipped with <b>vertical</b> <b>stiffeners</b> (VSs) are integrated into the joint. Oversized web holes of 4 – 10 mm are required to enable inelastic deformation for an overall joint rotation of 60 – 100 mrad, without undesirable web distortion. Further FE analyses are used to design the TCPs and VSs so they can be replaceable link post-seismic actions. For the final joint detailing it is shown that 6 mm oversized holes for the TCPs will delay the occurrence of yielding in the beam until the joint rotation is 70 mrad...|$|E
40|$|The superyacht {{manufacturing}} industry is currently facing big challenges, mainly {{related to the}} present economic crisis. Manufacturers are then competing on the ground of better and more aesthetic external and interior designs. This trend often leads to structural strength related issues, which can compromise the static or dynamic stability of superyacht hull. In several instances, the aforementioned fact is met, as in large openings and docks to recover tenders, the enlargement of windows to allow for better lighting of internal living spaces. So, for what the hull is concerned, large windows replaced small portholes on the yacht sides at mid length, rising non trivial problems about longitudinal strength. The same trend appeared on superstructures sides where traditional windows have been enlarged till to became glass doors extended from deck to deck which allow passengers to enjoy full sea landscapes. Despite the {{positive effect on the}} general design performance, this nice innovation implies serious structural problems. In fact in side areas where these doors are fitted the only structural elements are represented by very slender <b>vertical</b> <b>stiffeners.</b> The combined action of bending and compressive loads, together with the fact that superstructures are usually made by aluminium light alloy, can be the cause of buckling phenomena with severe consequences on structure and glass integrity. In this paper the contribution to steel hull strength of light alloy superstructures with large openings is studied by the finite element approach. A deep investigation of local strength of the superstructure has been assessed as well...|$|E
40|$|A T-section ringbeam, {{consisting}} of an annular plate and a <b>vertical</b> edge <b>stiffener,</b> is often provided {{at the intersection}} between the cylinder and the cone of an elevated storage silo or tank to resist a large circumferential compressive force at the intersection (the transition junction). Out-of-plane buckling, involving periodical twisting deformations of the ringbeam about its inner edge, is a common failure mode for this ringbeam. This paper is aimed at {{the development of a}} simple and rational approximation for the plastic out-of-plane buckling strength. As plastic buckling is the result of interaction between elastic buckling and plastic collapse, the present development is based on existing information on these two failure modes and a finite element parametric study on plastic buckling. Finite element results show that the interaction relationship between elastic buckling and plastic collapse, when cast in a suitable dimensionless form, is independent of yield stresses and most geometric ratios. This observation enables the establishment of two design approximations which are lower bound curves to finite element results. The simpler and more conservative approximation is proposed for use in design and its application is demonstrated in an example. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a new {{structure}} and fabrication technology for Parylene-based recording and stimulating penetrating microprobes with engineered mechanical stiffness, low cross-sectional area and sharp tips. Taking advantage of significant benefits from polymer microprobes is often prevented due to their troublesome insertion. This paper addresses this issue and describes a process that allows integrating <b>vertical</b> Parylene <b>stiffeners</b> in the shank without adding process complexity, increasing probe thickness and volume or compromising use in 2 D/ 3 D arrays. A metal mask formed around the tip allows for the local thinning down of Parylene, creating a sharp tip during an etch step. These features increase {{the stability of the}} probe while reducing both the load on the shank during implantation as well as the dimpling of the brain surface. Shanks 2 mm long, 20 µm thick and 380 µm wide were rendered stable enough for insertion into cadaver lamb brain through the pia by employing five stiffeners. Probes were fabricated in a three mask process with high yield (> 80 %), and under soak-tests it was determined that they remain electrically functional over a period of three months...|$|R
40|$|Conducting {{research}} in anticipating earthquake damage at building {{has been developed}} continuosly. One of it is Eccentrically Braced Frame (EBF) for steel frame. EBF uses link element to absorb earthquake energy. Failure at long type link dominantly is caused by moment which make early failure because of fracture and buckling {{at the end of}} link such as in its flange. To tackle the early failure, stiffener {{at the end of the}} link has been added. The advantages of it are making easy of workmanship and minimizing the welding effort which can reduce residual stress because of welding process. This study does numerical study by using MSC Nastran/Patran program to measure the performance of long type link for several analysis types. Several parameters have been analyzed such as the length of the link, the edge addition of flange plate with its modeling configuration, the width of the plate, and the combination with <b>vertical</b> body <b>stiffener.</b> This study found that the addition of stiffener at the end of the link has increased the performance of long type link. Finally, the findings of this study are compared with that of standard link model. The variables that are compared between both of long type link and standard link are ductility, strength, energy dissipation and stiffness...|$|R
