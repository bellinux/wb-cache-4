We use an analytical model as our principle method of conducting uncertainty analyses, which is {{the primary focus of}} this work. We investigate the impacts of changing the observed species (e. g., ozone, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and formaldehyde (HCHO)), observation frequency and quality upon the ability to predict the magnitude of summertime peak ozone events, characterize the uncertainties of those predictions, and the performance of the assimilation system. We use three observed species scenarios: CO and NO 2; ozone, CO, and NO 2; and HCHO, CO and NO 2. These scenarios are designed to test the effects of adding observations of either ozone or HCHO to an existing CO and NO 2 observing system. The studies were conducted using the photochemical model setup to simulate a range of summertime polluted environments spanning NO x limited to volatile organic compound (<b>VOC)</b> <b>limited</b> conditions. As the photochemical regime changes the relative importance of trace gas observations to constrain emission estimates and subsequent ozone forecasts varies.

This has the effect of increasing relative solids content (both pigment + binder) in the formulation, which has a negative effect on viscosity.

Increasing pigment content primarily affects low and medium shear viscosities, which are important for flow, leveling, and sag resistance.

40|$|Donor-acceptor organic {{solar cells}} often show high quantum yields for charge collection, but {{relatively}} low open-circuit voltages (<b>VOC)</b> <b>limit</b> power conversion efficiencies to around 12 %. We report here {{the behavior of}} a system, PIPCP:PC 61 BM, that exhibits very low electronic disorder (Urbach energy less than 27 meV), very high carrier mobilities in the blend (field-effect mobility for holes > 10 - 2 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1), and a very low driving energy for initial charge separation (50 meV). These characteristics should give excellent performance, and indeed, the VOC is high relative to the donor energy gap. However, we find the overall performance is limited by recombination, with formation of lower-lying triplet excitons on the donor accounting for 90 % of the recombination. We find this is a bimolecular process that happens on time scales as short as 100 ps. Thus, although the absence of disorder and the associated high carrier mobility speeds up charge diffusion and extraction at the electrodes, which we measure as early as 1 ns, this also speeds up the recombination channel, giving overall a modest quantum yield of around 60 %.

40|$|Nanoporous {{polymers}} {{prepared by}} cyclotrimerization reaction of amine or nitro functionalized 4, 4 ′diacetylbiphenyl were successfully introduced as active material in chemiresistive gas sensors for volatile organic compounds. Due to their different pore types and pore functionalization they exhibit different sensitivities and selectivities toward alcohols and ketones {{in the range}} of 100 – 3000 ppm. The amine functionalized polymers show the highest selectivities toward alcohols, whereas the nitro-functionalized show the highest toward ketones. Thus a differentiation of these VOCs was realized. Furthermore, the sensors exhibit for most of the <b>VOCs</b> <b>limits</b> of detection below 1 ppm and high sensitivities above 10 − 3 ppm− 1. These enhancements in sensor performance are due to the high surface area of up to 680 m 2 /g. The alcohol vapor adsorption behavior of these materials was studied in detail using vapor physisorption experiments. The higher sensitivity of the microporous amine functionalized polymer correlates well with a higher vapor uptake as compared to the other porous polymers. Moreover, the different selectivities could be correlated to the swelling behavior of the porous polymer during vapor adsorption.

40|$|We analyze summertime {{photochemistry}} {{near the}} surface in Beijing, China, using a 1 -D photochemical model (Regional chEmical and trAnsport Model, REAM- 1 D) constrained by in situ observations, focusing on the budgets of RO x (OH + HO 2 + RO 2) radicals and O 3 formation. While the modeling analysis focuses on near-surface photochemical budgets, the {{implications for the budget}} of O 3 in the planetary boundary layer are also discussed. In terms of daytime average, the total RO x primary production rate {{near the surface}} in Beijing is 6. 6 ppbv per hour (ppbv h − 1, among the highest found in urban atmospheres. The largest primary RO x source in Beijing is photolysis of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), which produces HO 2 and RO 2 at 2. 5 ppbv h − 1 and 1. 7 ppbv h − 1, respectively. Photolysis of excess HONO from an unknown heterogeneous source is the predominant primary OH source at 2. 2 ppbv h − 1, much larger than that of O 1 D+H 2 O (0. 4 ppbv h − 1). The largest RO x sink is via OH + NO 2 reaction (1. 6 ppbv h − 1), followed by formation of RO 2 NO 2 (1. 0 ppbv h − 1) and RONO 2 (0. 7 ppbv h − 1). Due to the large aerosol surface area, aerosol uptake of HO 2 appears to be another important radical sink, although the estimate of its magnitude is highly variable depending on the uptake coefficient value used. The daytime average O 3 production and loss rates near the surface are 32 ppbv h − 1 and 6. 2 ppbv h − 1, respectively. Assuming NO 2 to be the source of excess HONO, the NO 2 to HONO transformation leads to considerable O 3 loss and reduction of its lifetime. Our observation-constrained modeling analysis suggests that oxidation of VOCs (especially aromatics) and heterogeneous reactions (e. g. HONO formation and aerosol uptake HO 2) play potentially critical roles in the primary radical budget and O 3 formation in Beijing. One important ramification is that O 3 production is neither NO x nor <b>VOC</b> <b>limited,</b> but in a transition regime where reduction of either NO x or VOCs could result in reduction of O 3 production. The transition regime implies more flexibility in the O 3 control strategies than a binary system of either NO x or <b>VOC</b> <b>limited</b> regime. The co-benefit of concurrent reduction of both NO x and VOCs in reducing column O 3 production integrated in the planetary boundary layer is significant.

This study aims to simulate the regional and urban scale ozone concentrations in India using WRF-CMAQ models. Sector-specific emission inventories are prepared for the ozone precursor species at a finer resolution (36 × 36 km 2) than used in previous studies. Meteorological fields developed using the WRF model are fed into the CMAQ model along with the precursor emissions to simulate ozone concentrations at a regional scale. The model is validated using observed ozone dataset. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to understand the effect of different precursor species and sources on prevailing ozone concentrations in India. The results show that NOx sensitive conditions prevail in India and control of NOx will result in more reduction in ozone than VOCs.

40|$|The {{development}} of kesterite Cu 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 thin-film solar cells is currently hindered {{by the large}} deficit of open-circuit voltage (Voc), which results from the easy formation of CuZn antisite acceptor defects. Suppressing the formation of CuZn defects, especially near the absorber/buffer interface, is thus critical for the further improvement of kesterite solar cells. In this paper, it is shown {{that there is a}} large disparity between the defects in Cu- and Ag-based kesterite semiconductors, i. e., the CuZn or CuCd acceptor defects have high concentration and are the dominant defects in Cu 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 or Cu 2 CdSnS 4, but the AgZn acceptor has only a low concentration and the dominant defects are donors in Ag 2 ZnSnS 4. Therefore, the Cu-based kesterites always show p-type conductivity, while the Ag-based kesterites show either intrinsic or weak n-type conductivity. Based on this defect disparity and calculated band alignment, it is proposed that the <b>Voc</b> <b>limit</b> of the kesterite solar cells can be overcome by alloying Cu 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 with Ag 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4, and the composition-graded (Cu,Ag) 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 alloys should be ideal light-absorber materials for achieving higher efficiency kesterite solar cells.

A regional photochemical modeling experiment {{was set up to}} simulate a high ozone episode of September 11 – 14, 2002 in order to evaluate the impact of various anthropogenic emissions sources on ozone concentrations. The base case simulation showed reasonable model performance by capturing the peaks and the diurnal variability of observed ozone concentrations within the modeling domain. A comprehensive impact assessment of anthropogenic emissions from various source categories to the 8 –hour ozone concentration was evaluated for each of the urban areas within the study region. Through a source apportionment analysis of emissions influencing the 8 – hour ozone concentrations, NOx and <b>VOC</b> <b>limited</b> areas were identified. The model results showed that the net effect of all anthropogenic emissions was approximately 8. 4 ppb in Victoria, 8. 8 ppb in Corpus Christi, and 31. 2 and 34. 1 ppb in Austin and San Antonio, respectively. Impact of major emissions source categories differed regionally with ozone concentrations in Austin and San Antonio mainly influenced by mobile sources, while Corpus Christi and Victoria were largely impacted by long–range transport of ozone. On a local scale, Corpus Christi was also impacted by non–road sources, while Victoria was influenced by point sources. Ozone sensitivity analysis showed higher sensitivity towards VOC within the urban cores of Austin, San Antonio, and Corpus Christi, while the overall modeling regions showed higher NOx sensitivity. This would indicate that both NOx and VOC emissions reduction plans need to be developed and implemented for the mitigation of regional and urban ozone.

Ozone production rates P(O 3) and their sensitivity to NOx and volatile organic carbons (VOCs) are calculated using observed concentrations as inputs {{to a steady}} state box model. City to city comparisons are made to illustrate common features of urban photochemistry and features that are unique to specific cities. Ozone production rates vary from nearly zero to 155 ppb h− 1. Differences in P(O 3) depend on precursor concentrations, namely, radical sources, NOx and VOCs. Under conditions where P(O 3) is greater than 25 ppb h− 1, {{there is a potential}} to produce enough same‐day O 3 to transform a typical regional background into a severe O 3 episode. Six such cases were observed, in Nashville, Philadelphia, and Houston, with elevated O 3 concentrations in the afternoon (130 – 211 ppb) following a morning in which P(O 3) was 25 – 140 ppb h− 1. High P(O 3) occurs when NOx concentrations are 5 – 25 ppb and OH‐VOC reactivity is above 5 s− 1. These conditions are infrequent, and aside from a common dependence on calm winds, reasons vary from city to city. In Nashville, high P(O 3) was observed during a stagnation event over downtown and under the circumstance that an air mass with a high concentration of isoprene encountered a NOx source. In Houston, NOx and light olefins are coemitted from petrochemical facilities leading to the highest P(O 3) s of the five cities studied. High values of P(O 3) did not occur in Phoenix because of low radical production, caused mainly by a dry atmosphere, and a low VOC to NOx ratio.

40|$|Rapid {{urbanization}} {{and economic}} development in East Asia in past decades has led to photochemical air pollution problems such as excess photochemical ozone and aerosol formation. Asian megacities such as Seoul, Tokyo, Shanghai, Gangzhou, and Beijing are surrounded by densely forested areas and recent research has consistently demonstrated the importance of biogenic volatile organic compounds from vegetation in determining oxidation capacity in the suburban Asian megacity regions. Uncertainties in constraining tropospheric oxidation capacity, dominated by hydroxyl radical concentrations, undermine our ability to assess regional photochemical air pollution problems. We present an observational dataset of CO, NO x, SO 2, ozone, HONO, and VOCs (anthropogenic and biogenic) from Taehwa Research Forest (TRF) near the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) in early June 2012. The data show that TRF is influenced both by aged pollution and fresh BVOC emissions. With the dataset, we diagnose HO x (OH, HO 2, and RO 2) distributions calculated with the University of Washington Chemical Box Model (UWCM v 2. 1). Uncertainty from unconstrained HONO sources and radical recycling processes highlighted in recent studies is examined using multiple model simulations with different model constraints. The results suggest that (1) different model simulation scenarios cause systematic differences in HO x distributions especially OH levels (up to 2. 5 times) and (2) radical destruction (HO 2 +HO 2 or HO 2 +RO 2) could be more efficient than radical recycling (HO 2 +NO) especially in the afternoon. Implications of the uncertainties in radical chemistry are discussed with respect to ozone-VOC-NO x sensitivity and oxidation product formation rates. Overall, the <b>VOC</b> <b>limited</b> regime in ozone photochemistry is predicted but the degree of sensitivity can significantly {{vary depending on the}} model scenarios. The model results also suggest that RO 2 levels are positively correlated with OVOCs production that is not routinely constrained by observations. These unconstrained OVOCs can cause higher than expected OH loss rates (missing OH reactivity) and secondary organic aerosol formation. The series of modeling experiments constrained by observations strongly urge observational constraint of the radical pool to enable precise understanding of regional photochemical pollution problems in the East Asian megacity region...|$|R

On {{the basis of the}} data from a pilot-scale vertical flow filter intermittently fed with domestic waste water, model predictions on the system’s performance for the treatment of contaminated groundwater were derived. These simulations considered the transport and aerobic degradation of ammonium and two VOCs, benzene and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). In addition, the advective-diffusive gas-phase transport of volatile compounds as well as oxygen was simulated. Model predictions addressed the influence of depth and frequency of the intermittent groundwater injection, degradation rate kinetics, and the composition of the filter material. Simulation results show that for unfavorable operation conditions significant VOC emissions have to be considered and that operation modes <b>limiting</b> <b>VOC</b> emissions may <b>limit</b> aerobic biodegradation. However, a suitable combination of injection depth and composition of the filter material does facilitate high biodegradation rates while only little VOC emissions take place. Using such optimized operation modes would allow using vertical flow filter systems as remediation technology suitable for groundwater contaminated with volatile compound...|$|R
5|$|VOC forces {{landed on}} 4–5 May on Trunajaya's right flank. Trunajaya {{did not expect}} an attack on this flank, and {{consequently}} it was only lightly defended. VOC took Ampel after little resistance. In the following days, the VOC established its battery in Ampel, simultaneously conducting desultory negotiations with Trunajaya. Trunajaya accused Speelman of being unknightly by attacking his right flank instead of his main position. Both Trunajaya and VOC moved their works forward until their artillery batteries faced each other at pistol-shot distance. Trunajaya dammed the river, the VOC's source of fresh water; afterwards, the <b>VOC</b> troops were <b>limited</b> to brackish water, and diseases soon spread.|$|R
40|$|Sorption {{effects of}} a number of {{combinations}} of indoor materials and volatile organic compounds have been investigated. A limited number of experiments have been conducted to investigate the influence of parameters such as the adsorption time, the desorption time, the concentration of the pollutants and the temperature, on the sorption. Experiments were performed with vapours of single compounds and with mixtures of VOCs. All parameters have an influence on the sorption. A relatively quick screening method can be applied with mixtures of <b>VOCs</b> with a <b>limited</b> adsorption time and desorption time (6 h each). Air samples should be collected {{at the end of the}} adsorption time and during the desorption time. © Indoor Air (1998) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{analytical}} {{performances of}} needle trap micro-extraction (NTME) coupled with gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry {{were evaluated by}} analyzing a mixture of twenty-two representative breath VOCs belonging to different chemical classes (i. e. hydrocarbons, ketones, aldehydes, aromatics and sulfurs). NTME is an emerging technique that guarantees detection limits in pptv range by pre-concentrating low volumes of sample, and it is particularly suitable for breath analysis. For most <b>VOCs,</b> detection <b>limits</b> between 20 and 500 pptv were obtained by pre-concentrating 25 mL of a humidified standard gas mixture at a flow rate of 15 mL/min. For all compounds, inter- and intra-day precisions were always below 15 %, confirming {{the reliability of the}} method. The procedure was successfully applied to the analysis of exhaled breath samples collected from forty heart failure patients during their stay in the University Hospital of Pisa. The majority of patients (about 80 %) showed a significant decrease of breath acetone levels (a factor of 3 or higher) at discharge compared to admission (acute phase) in correspondence to the improved clinical conditions during hospitalization, thus making this compound eligible as a biomarker of heart failure exacerbation...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} {{detailed}} technical {{description of the system}} that was set up for long-term on-line measurements of isoprene and two of its major degradation products, methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein in order to provide {{a better understanding of the}} role of forest stands as a complex source of reactive trace gases into the troposphere and to elucidate the role of forests as chemical reactors. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are preconcentrated on cartridges containing a package of two solid adsorbents (Tenax TA and Carbopack X). Ozone removal is performed prior to sampling by titration with nitrogen monoxide. For the calibration and characterization of the system, a diffusion source was built to produce standard gas mixtures of up to 16 different compounds with mixing ratios at tens ppt (parts per trillion) level mixing ratios and high accuracy. The developed system allows a reliable quantification of these <b>VOCs</b> (detection <b>limit</b> similar to 10 ppt, reproducibility similar to 5 %) with a high temporal resolution (similar to 30 min) and has proven to be stable and run automatically without major maintainence.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{relationship}} between outside air ventilation rate and concentrations of VOCs generated indoors was conducted in a call center. Ventilation rates were manipulated in the building's four air handling units (AHUs). Concentrations of VOCs in the AHU returns were measured on 7 days during a 13 -week period. Indoor minus outdoor concentrations and emission factors were calculated. The emission factor data was subjected to principal component analysis to identify groups of co-varying compounds based on source type. One vector represented emissions of solvents from cleaning products. Another vector identified occupant sources. Direct relationships between ventilation rate and concentrations were not observed for most of the abundant VOCs. This result emphasizes the importance of source control measures for <b>limiting</b> <b>VOC</b> concentrations in buildings...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) in litho-graphic printing cleanup is an environmental and occupa-tional hazard. Regulations to reduce ambient ozone levels <b>limited</b> <b>VOC</b> emissions from lithographic cleanup operations and spurred the development of low-VOC alternatives. The purpose of this project was to promote the substitution of hazardous cleanup solvents with less toxic chemicals to protect the health of workers and the environment. A convenience sample of printers, employers, union, industry, and government representatives was constructed. Data regarding the litho-graphic printing work force {{and the use of}} cleanup solvents and alternatives were collected through: (1) work site walk-throughs, (2) a focus group, (3) key informant interviews, (4) a half-day workshop, and (5) demonstration projects.
