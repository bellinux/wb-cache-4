This modification added a set of vertical antennas and a new elevation-measuring CRT to read them, along with a radiogoniometer that allowed the <b>vertical</b> <b>angle</b> to be accurately measured. Mk. I*'s with GL/EF began to deploy in early 1941, just as The Blitz was reaching a crescendo.|$|E
25|$|The {{equality}} of vertically opposite angles {{is called the}} <b>vertical</b> <b>angle</b> theorem. Eudemus of Rhodes attributed the proof to Thales of Miletus. The proposition showed that since both {{of a pair of}} vertical angles are supplementary to both of the adjacent angles, the vertical angles are equal in measure. According to a historical Note, when Thales visited Egypt, he observed that whenever the Egyptians drew two intersecting lines, they would measure the vertical angles {{to make sure that they}} were equal. Thales concluded that one could prove that all vertical angles are equal if one accepted some general notions such as: all straight angles are equal, equals added to equals are equal, and equals subtracted from equals are equal.|$|E

25|$|Sound {{localization}} is {{the process}} of determining the location of a sound source. The brain utilizes subtle differences in loudness, tone and timing between the two ears to allow us to localize sound sources. Localization can be described in terms of three-dimensional position: the azimuth or horizontal angle, the zenith or <b>vertical</b> <b>angle,</b> and the distance (for static sounds) or velocity (for moving sounds). Humans, as most four-legged animals, are adept at detecting direction in the horizontal, but less so in the vertical due to the ears being placed symmetrically. Some species of owls have their ears placed asymmetrically, and can detect sound in all three planes, an adaption to hunt small mammals in the dark.|$|E
25|$|The {{transmitter}} {{system on the}} Mk. I produced 3microsecond (µs) long pulses with up to 50kW of power 1,500 times a second. These were broadcast semi-directionally, floodlighting the entire area {{in front of the}} transmitter antenna's current bearing. Since the signal was even less directional vertically than horizontally, a significant amount of the signal hit the ground. Due to the long wavelengths used, this signal was strongly reflected forward, and due to geometrical considerations, any signal hitting the ground near the station would reflect with enough of a <b>vertical</b> <b>angle</b> to mix with the main signal in the area of interest (about 30km around the station). This was the purpose of the GL mat, which did not eliminate the reflections, but made them much more predictable.|$|E

60|$|Reflecting the Sun with a Mirror.--To {{attract the}} notice of a {{division}} of your party, five or even ten miles off, glitter a bit of looking-glass in the sun, throwing its flash towards where {{you expect them to}} be. It is quite astonishing at how great a distance the gleam of the glass will catch the sharp eyes of a bushman who has learnt to know what it is. It is now a common signal in the North American prairies. (Sullivan.) It should be recollected that a passing flash has far less briliancy than one that dwells for an appreciable time on the retina of the observer; therefore the signaller should do all he can to steady his aim. I find the steadiest way of holding the mirror is to rest the hand firmly against the forehead, and to keep the eyes continually fixed upon the same distant object. The glare of the sun that is reflected from each point of the surface of a mirror forms a cone of light whose <b>vertical</b> <b>angle</b> is constant, and equal to that subtended by the sun. Hence when a flash is sent to a distant place, the size of the mirror is of no appreciable importance in affecting the size of the area over which the flash is visible. That area is the section of the fasciculus of cones that proceed from each point of the mirror, which, in the case we have supposed, differs immaterially from the cone reflected from a single point. Hence, if a man watches the play of the flash from his mirror upon a very near object, it will appear to him of the shape and size of the mirror; but as he retreats from the object, the edges of the flash become rounded, and very soon the flash appears a perfect circle, of precisely the same apparent diameter as the disc of the sun: it will, in short, look just like a very faint sun. The signaller has to cause this disc of light to cover the person whose notice he wishes to attract. I will proceed to show how he can do so; but in the mean time it will be evident that a pretty careful aim is requisite, or he will fail in his object. The steadiness of his aim must be just twice as accurate, neither more nor less, as would suffice to point a rifle at the sun when it was sufficiently obscured by a cloud to bear being looked at: for the object of the aim is of the same apparent size, but a movement of a mirror causes the ray reflected from it to move through a double angle.|$|E

50|$|Wilkins' {{method of}} height-finding was added in 1937. He had {{originally}} developed this {{system as a}} way to measure the <b>vertical</b> <b>angle</b> of transatlantic broadcasts while working at the RRS. The system consisted of several parallel dipoles separated vertically on the receiver masts. Normally the RDF goniometer was connected to two dipoles at the same height and used to determine the bearing to a target return. For height finding, the operator instead connected two antennas at different heights and carried out the same basic operation to determine the <b>vertical</b> <b>angle.</b> Because the antenna was deliberately focused vertically to improve gain, a single pair of such antennas would only cover a thin <b>vertical</b> <b>angle.</b> A series of such antennas was used, each pair with a different center angle, providing continual coverage from about 2.5 degrees over the horizon to as much as 40 degrees above it. With this addition, the final remaining piece of Watt's original memo was accomplished and the system was ready to go into production.|$|E
