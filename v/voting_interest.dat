30|$|Efficient {{internal}} control can, to some extent, prevent the self-interested behaviours resulting from agency problems in incomplete contracts, for example, unfair related party transactions, managerial opportunism and earnings management (Li et al. [2004]; Meng and Zhang [2006]; Rao et al. [2008]). In this paper, {{we focus on}} the impact of {{internal control}} quality on related party transactions because such transactions can be managed by related parties and directly influence corporate value. According to FASB No. 57, related parties are defined to include three basic categories of individuals: board members, executives and principal owners (owners of more than 10 % of <b>voting</b> <b>interests</b> of the enterprise). Considering the influence power of these stakeholders in CSOEs, related party transactions attract more attention from researchers and regulatory entities than unrelated party transactions. Fair related party transactions have arm-length prices and normal business processes, which efficiently fulfil underlying economic needs of the company (Gordon et al. [2004]). However, unfair related party transactions under a weak governance system with agency conflicts are often used to transfer wealth for private benefits of related parties (Chen and Wang [2005]; Cheung et al. [2009]).|$|R
5000|$|Although {{majority}} {{controlled by}} Norman Lear, Act III Broadcasting was financed {{by a large}} group of other Wall Street interests and shareholders. The company was seeded by Lear, but quickly added the General Motors Pension Fund as a shareholder. Debt was provided by GE Capital. [...] The company was comprehensively refinanced in 1989 with a $100m bond offering taken down by Prudential Insurance. The Prudential notes were themselves re-financed following the recovery from the 1989-92 recession, in 1993 at a lower rate. [...] Act III's judicious use of leverage in an industry historically financed with limited partnerships was considered a model of leveraged finance and resulted in a case study at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia. [...] The eventual exit at over a 600% return on investment marks {{one of the most successful}} Broadcast ventures in industry history. As of 1991 it was reported that Lear, through Act III Communications, controlled 35% of the common stock of Act III Broadcasting and 80% of the <b>voting</b> <b>interests.</b> [...] Prior to the sale in 1997/98 the company undertook various buyouts of minority interests which increased the Act III Communications/Lear stake to an undetermined, but higher level.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{study the}} electoral {{competition}} between two parties vying for seats in a legislature. The electorate includes knowledgeable voters and impressionable voters, the latter susceptible to electioneering activities. A {{special interest group}} provides campaign financing in exchange for influence over the platforms. The parties take positions on two issues, one on which their divergent platforms are fixed and another pliable issue where their announcements are used to woo dollars and <b>votes.</b> The <b>interest</b> group contributes {{with the knowledge that}} the final policies will be a compromise between the positions of the two parties. We examine two modes of voting behavior. When knowledgeable voters vote sincerely, the parties' positions on thepliable issue diverge, and the more popular party caters more to the special interest group. When knowledgeable voters <b>vote</b> strategically, the <b>interest</b> group often induces the parties to announce identical pliable platforms. We investigate the determinants of the platforms, contributions, vote counts, and policy compromise, and consider how changes in legislative institutions might affect these outcomes. ...|$|R
