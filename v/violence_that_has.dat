You are responsible for the <b>violence</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been done, whether you were actually engaged in it or not. You on your part must drive away from you the evil-disposed people who have done so much harm, and discountenance in the plainest way everything tending to violence.|$|E
25|$|Some sources {{state that}} {{gay and lesbian}} couples {{experience}} domestic violence at the same frequency as heterosexual couples, while other sources state domestic violence among gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals might be higher than among heterosexual individuals, that gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals {{are less likely to}} report domestic <b>violence</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> occurred in their intimate relationships than heterosexual couples are, or that lesbian couples experience domestic violence less than heterosexual couples do. One study focusing on Hispanic men indicated that gay men are less likely to have been perpetrators or victims of domestic violence than heterosexual men but that bisexual men {{are more likely to have}} been both. By contrast, some researchers commonly assume that lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same rate as heterosexual couples, and have been more cautious when reporting domestic violence among gay male couples.|$|E

2500|$|A {{split in}} the Zetas could be {{encouraging}} for rival gangs. That in turn {{could prove to be}} a [...] "major headache" [...] for President Enrique Peña Nieto, who has vowed to reduce the <b>violence</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> killed more than 50,000 since 2006. If the Zetas break apart, drug violence in Mexico could increase, with over 10,000 cartel members fighting for control. Some security officials say that the split is proof {{of the success of the}} government crackdown, while others say that the infighting can prove to be problematic because [...] "... it's like if the HIV virus mutates. Then you have to find two vaccines." [...] Los Zetas are responsible for much of the violence in Mexico's drug war and they have expanded despite other cartels allying against them. A 2012 report indicated that the Zetas were present in 16 of the 31 states in Mexico, more than the wealthiest crime group, the Sinaloa Cartel.|$|E
2500|$|Guadalajara, due to {{the ongoing}} Mexican Drug War, has seen {{escalating}} violence. Some countries, including the United States and Canada, expressed concerns about the safety and security of the region. Scott Backmun of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) raised concerns about the city's ability to host the games {{in light of the}} drug war. Due to the increased safety issues the USOC had its own security plan for the games. During a meeting of the USOC in March 2011, chief security officer Larry Buendorf gave a report {{to the rest of the}} committee in which he said, [...] "We’re going to prepare for Guadalajara like we would any other Games. A lot of that is just preparing your athletes for the individual environments that they’re going into. Everybody is quite aware of the <b>violence</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> happened. We’re obviously concerned about it, and at the end of the day, I think we have a good security plan in place to try to protect our athletes". After grenades were thrown near a nightclub entrance in two separate incidents in February 2011, organizers said they were making security a priority and arranged for police and members of the armed forces to patrol in Guadalajara throughout the games.|$|E
2500|$|Another lauded {{performance}} {{was that of}} Peggy Ashcroft as Margaret, whose role is usually heavily cut, and often eliminated entirely from both 1 Henry VI and, especially, Richard III. Margaret is the only character to appear in all four plays (unless one counts the Ghost of Henry VI in Richard III), and Ashcroft relished the chance to develop the character over the entire production, arguing that Margaret is [...] "a Dark Lady {{if ever there was}} one - and prototype for Cressida, Cleopatra, Lady Macbeth - was Shakespeare's first [...] "heroine" [...] - if such she can be called [...] It takes four plays to make her one of the great female characters in Shakespeare - and the full-length portrait has been seen only in The Wars of the Roses cycle - but she has facets that are not touched on in any other." [...] Ashcroft saw the scene from 2 Henry VI where she appears on-stage carrying the head of her lover, the Duke of Suffolk, as pivotal to both the character's development and her own understanding of Margaret; [...] "I came to realise why this scene was of paramount importance - for later in what is one of the greatest and certainly most horrific scenes [...] when Margaret wipes the blood of York's son on the Duke's face [...] I found that seemingly impossible bestial act to be credible as the result of the <b>violence</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been perpetrated on her lover." ...|$|E

6000|$|We {{have spoken}} of waves [...] "travelling" [...] at {{such and such}} a rate, {{but they do not}} in reality travel at all. It is the undulation, or, so to speak, the motion of a wave, that travels; in the same manner that a wave passes from one end of a carpet to the other end when it is shaken. The water remains stationary, {{excepting}} the spray and foam on the surface, and is only possessed of a rising and sinking motion. This undulatory motion, or impulse, is transmitted from each particle of water to its neighbouring particle, until it reaches the last drop of water on the shore. But when a wave reaches shallow water it has no longer room to sink to its proper depth; hence the water composing it acquires actual motion, and rushes to the land with more or less of the tremendous <b>violence</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been already described.|$|E
