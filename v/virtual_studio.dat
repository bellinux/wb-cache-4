This was later replaced following viewer criticism. The studio bore similarities with the ITN-produced ITV News in 2004, though ITN uses a CSO <b>Virtual</b> <b>studio</b> rather than the actual screens at BBC News.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s to 1970s, the {{development}} of miniaturized solid-state components allowed synthesizers to become self-contained, portable instruments, as proposed by Harald Bode in 1961. By the early 1980s, companies were selling compact, modestly priced synthesizers to the public. This, along with {{the development of}} Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI), made it easier to integrate and synchronize synthesizers and other electronic instruments for use in musical composition. In the 1990s, synthesizer emulations began to appear in computer software, known as software synthesizers. From 1996 onward, Steinberg's <b>Virtual</b> <b>Studio</b> Technology (VST) plug-ins – {{and a host of other}} kinds of competing plug-in software, all designed to run on personal computers – began emulating classic hardware synthesizers, becoming increasingly successful at doing so during the following decades.|$|E
25|$|The {{main parts}} of the Vocaloid 2 system are the Score Editor (Vocaloid 2 Editor), the Singer Library, and the Synthesis Engine. The Synthesis Engine {{receives}} score information from the Score Editor, selects appropriate samples from the Singer Library, and concatenates them to output synthesized voices. There is basically {{no difference in the}} Score Editor and the Synthesis Engine provided by Yamaha among different Vocaloid 2 products. If a Vocaloid 2 product is already installed, the user can enable another Vocaloid 2 product by adding its library. The system supports three languages, Japanese, Korean, and English, although other languages may be optional in the future. It works standalone (playback and export to WAV) and as a ReWire application or a <b>Virtual</b> <b>Studio</b> Technology instrument (VSTi) accessible from a digital audio workstation (DAW).|$|E
25|$|By the mid 2000s {{a number}} of {{software-based}} <b>virtual</b> <b>studio</b> environments had emerged, with products such as Propellerhead's Reason and Ableton Live finding popular appeal. These software-based music production tools offer viable and cost-effective alternatives to typical hardware-based production studios, and thanks to advances in microprocessor technology, can create high quality music using {{little more than a}} single laptop computer. Such advances democratized music creation, and lead to a massive increase in the amount of home-produced music available to the general public via the internet. Artists can now also individuate their sound by creating personalized software synthesizers, effects modules, and various composition environments. Devices that once existed exclusively in the hardware domain can easily have virtual counterparts. Some of the more popular software tools for achieving such ends are commercial releases such as Max/Msp and Reaktor and freeware packages such as Pure Data, SuperCollider, and ChucK. In some sense, as a result of technological innovation, the DIY mentality that was once a core part of dance music culture is seeing a resurgence.|$|E

Anglia's former network production centre at Magdalen Street has {{been taken over by}} Norfolk County Council and extensively re-vamped. After total investment of £4m from the East of England Development Agency (EEDA) it has re-opened as EPIC Studios (East of England Production Innovation Centre). Degree courses in film and video are also run at the centre by Norwich University of the Arts. EPIC has commercial, broadcast quality post-production facilities, a real-time <b>virtual</b> <b>studio</b> and a smaller HD discussion studio. The main studio opened as an HD facility in November 2008. Throughout 2008, the centre has concentrated on the development of new TV formats and has worked on pilot shows with Les Dennis, Gaby Roslin, Christopher Biggins.|$|E

50|$|A <b>virtual</b> <b>studio</b> is a {{television}} studio {{that allows the}} real-time combination of people or other real objects and computer generated environments and objects in a seamless manner. A key point of a <b>virtual</b> <b>studio</b> is that the real camera can move in 3D space, while {{the image of the}} virtual camera is being rendered in real-time from the same perspective, therefore, this virtual scene has to adapt at any time to the camera settings (zoom, pan, angle, traveling, etc.). This is what differentiates a <b>virtual</b> <b>studio</b> from the traditional technique of chromakey. It also differs from techniques used in film, in which scenes are edited later. A <b>virtual</b> <b>studio</b> does not need any post production because it is in real-time. However a 3-D graphic artist and 3D computer graphics software are needed to create the virtual background, and any graphics that appear in front.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Optical {{tracking}} systems have become particularly popular in <b>virtual</b> <b>studios</b> applications tending to substitute electromechanical ones. However, optical systems {{are reported to}} be inferior in terms of accuracy in camera motion estimation. Moreover, marker-based approaches often cause problems in image/video compositing and impose undesirable constraints on camera movement. Present work introduces a novel methodology {{for the construction of}} a two-tone blue screen, which allows the localization of camera in three-dimensional (3 -D) space on the basis of the captured sequence. At the same time, a novel algorithm is presented for the extraction of camera’s 3 -D motion parameters based on 3 -D-to-two-dimensional (2 -D) line correspondences. Simulated experiments have been included to illustrate the performance of the proposed system.
