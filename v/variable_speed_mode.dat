40|$|Member, IEEE Wind {{turbines}} can {{in principle}} be operated to smooth wind power fluctuations by allowing wider variations in turbine speed and generator torque to store and release energy. This ability must be constrained by turbine speed and generator torque limits. To date, {{work in the}} literature is conceptual and does not indicate what extent of smoothing is possible before component limits are reached, nor does it quantify sensitivity to variations in the input wind speed. This paper introduces a method for quantifying how much wind variation a wind turbine can absorb in <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>mode</b> while still being guaranteed to operate within its component limits. One can apply this method to obtain the dependence of maximum tolerable wind disturbance on the smoothing time constant, and thus make design decisions. The paper shows that the analysis of torque speed intersections, as standardly applied in electric machine theory, is of limited use for studying power smoothing. The new conclusions and design choices made available by the proposed method are illustrated {{with a series of}} computation examples. The method is shown to agree asymptotically with two limiting cases that can be calculated based on torque-intersection analysis. The method is based on new theory for computing invariance kernels for nonlinear planar systems and can be adapted to assess the robustness of other control laws...|$|E

40|$|The latest {{forecasts}} on {{the upcoming}} {{effects of climate}} change are leading to a change in the worldwide power production model, with governments promoting clean and renewable energies, as is the case of tidal energy. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to improve the efficiency and lower the costs of the involved processes in order to achieve a Levelized Cost of Energy (LCoE) that allows these devices to be commercially competitive. In this context, this paper presents a novel complementary control strategy aimed to maximize the output power of a Tidal Stream Turbine (TST) composed of a hydrodynamic turbine, a Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) and a back-to-back power converter. In particular, a global control scheme that supervises the switching between the two operation modes is developed and implemented. When the tidal speed is low enough, the plant operates in <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>mode,</b> where the system is regulated so that the turbo-generator module works in maximum power extraction mode for each given tidal velocity. For this purpose, the proposed back-to-back converter makes use of the field-oriented control in both the rotor side and grid side converters, so that a maximum power point tracking-based rotational speed control is applied in the Rotor Side Converter (RSC) to obtain the maximum power output. Analogously, when the system operates in power limitation mode, a pitch angle control is used to limit the power captured in the case of high tidal speeds. Both control schemes are then coordinated within a novel complementary control strategy. The results show an excellent performance of the system, affording maximum power extraction regardless of the tidal stream input...|$|E

Heat release, combustion duration, and cylinder gas temperatures were derived from cylinder pressure data. System component design and the effects of component limitations on <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> operation are discussed. Once a <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> operating strategy is determined for a sample 15 kW system, test data are used to determine fuel savings and to estimate the potential for improvements in emissions, cold weather fouling, and engine wear. ^ Results show that <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> systems are most applicable where the peak power system capability is large compared to the average load.
