Also in 2010, Gatorade introduced the G Natural Gatorade line which is made with [...] "natural flavors and ingredients", specifically sweetened with Stevia and sold in Whole Foods grocery stores within the United States. G Natural was released in two flavors: G Orange Citrus and G2 Berry. The G Series began to replace prior iterations of Gatorade product lines in the U.S. (the brand's highest <b>volume</b> <b>market)</b> in 2010, and Canada in 2011. While Gatorade products have historically been developed for athletes engaging in competitive sporting events, a separate line of products formulated for consumption before, during and after personal fitness exercise {{was introduced in the}} U.S. in 2011. Labeled under the name G Series FIT, this product line consists of pre-workout fruit-and-nut bites, lightly flavored electrolyte replacement drinks, as well as post-workout protein recovery smoothies.|$|E

5000|$|The {{market size}} is defined through the <b>market</b> <b>volume</b> and the <b>market</b> potential. The <b>market</b> <b>volume</b> {{exhibits}} {{the totality of}} all realized sales volume of a special <b>market.</b> The <b>volume</b> is therefore dependent on the quantity of consumers and their ordinary demand. Furthermore, the <b>market</b> <b>volume</b> is either measured in quantities or qualities. The quantities can be given in technical terms, like GW for power capacities, or in numbers of items. Qualitative measuring mostly uses the sales turnover as an indicator. That means that the market price and the quantity are taken into account. Besides the <b>market</b> <b>volume,</b> the <b>market</b> potential is of equal importance. It defines the upper limit of the total demand and takes potential clients into consideration. Although the market potential is rather fictitious, it offers good values of orientation.

40|$|The {{lead-lag}} relationships {{present in}} the regional price discovery process are important indicators of market performance. Differences across markets in the speed of adjustment to evolving information may have implications for pricing efficiency within these markets. This study estimates intertemporal price relationships among 11 regional slaughter cattle <b>markets.</b> Larger <b>volume</b> <b>markets,</b> located in the major cattle feeding regions, were the dominant price discovery locations. Price adjustments across markets were completed in one to {{two weeks in the}} large <b>volume</b> <b>markets</b> located relatively close to each other and in two to three weeks in the more remote, smaller <b>volume</b> <b>markets.</b> Key words: cattle prices, price dynamics, cattle markets. Commodity price at a particular location is determined by local supply and demand con-ditions. Spatial arbitrage should force the dif-ferences in prices across locations to be no greater than transportation costs. Thus, with efficient arbitrage activities, market prices will approach a unique spatial equilibrium. How-ever, spatial arbitrage may not be instanta-neous. This is, the physical arbitrage process may take time to complete, and it may take time for arbitragers to recognize that an arbi-trage opportunity is present. Thus, commodity prices may be slow to adjust to changes in supply and demand. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the dynamic price relationships among regional slaughter cattle markets. Price discovery is the process by which buy-ers and sellers arrive at specific transaction prices through negotiation, bidding, formula, or public establishment (Tomek and Robin-son). Price discovery is primarily "concerned with the actions of buyers and sellers as they interact in the market place on the basis of something less than perfect information con-cerning the level of supply and demand " (Pur-cell, p. 107).

5000|$|The {{solution}} {{had arrived}} with Auto Union. They had attracted a small following with their technologically advanced Audi front-wheel drive medium sedans. Volkswagen had acquired the Ingolstadt-based company in 1964 from Daimler-Benz. Audi's expertise in water-cooled engines and front-wheel drive would be essential {{in developing a}} new generation of Volkswagens. The Audi technology in the Golf would regain for Volkswagen the engineering lead over rear-drive cars that Ferdinand Porsche had bestowed on the original Beetle over its large conventional peers. The small Golf had to succeed in replacing the high-volume Volkswagen coupe. The upmarket Dasher/Passat would be VW's first front-wheel-drive car, and it was relatively well received for its lower <b>volume</b> <b>market,</b> where it competed mostly alongside the rear-wheel drive saloons like the Ford Cortina, although there are already some front-wheel drive cars and even hatchbacks like the Austin Maxi and Renault 16 in this market sector. The Golf would adopt an efficient [...] "two-box" [...] layout with a steep hatch rather than a formal trunk, which would be later added in the Jetta. The water-cooled engine would be mounted transversely in the front. Work on the Golf began in 1969, shortly after Kurt Lotz became head of Volkswagen.|$|E

30|$|Finally, {{evolutionary}} theory considers issues of natural selection, which {{are critical to}} financial innovation. Here, {{the question of whether}} natural selection applies to financial innovation can be explored. Several factors can influence the process of natural selection in the development of financial innovation. Bettzüge and Hens (2001), for instance, present a model in which the survival of new financial products depends on sufficiently high trading <b>volumes,</b> <b>marketing,</b> and new hedging opportunities. Johnston and McConnell (1989) find that the success and diffusion of financial securities may depend on which financial innovation has the best security design.|$|R
5000|$|Another useful {{benchmark}} is {{the average}} price that customers pay for brands in a given category. This average can be calculated {{in at least two}} ways: (1) as the ratio of total category revenue to total category unit sales, or (2) as the unit-share weighted average price in the category. Note that the market Average Price Paid includes the brand under consideration. Note also that changes in unit shares will affect the average price paid. If a low-price brand steals shares from a higher-priced rival, the average price paid will decline. This would cause a firm’s price premium (calculated using the average price paid as a benchmark) to rise, even if its absolute price did not change. Similarly, if a brand is priced at a premium, that premium will decline as it gains share. The reason: a market share gain by a premium-priced brand will cause the overall average price paid in its market to rise. This, in turn, will reduce the price differential between that brand and the market average[...] [...] [...] To calculate the price premium using the average price paid benchmark, managers can also divide a brand’s share of the market in value terms by its share in volume terms. If value and <b>volume</b> <b>market</b> shares are equal, there is no premium. If value share is greater than volume share, then there is a positive price premium.|$|E

40|$|The {{statistical}} {{properties of}} various measures of risk were investigated {{with a view}} to explaining the reasons for lack of use in finance of risk measures other than the variance, and {{to see if there is}} a sensible measure to use for cross-European comparisons. As examples, the semi-variance, the lower partial moment, the Gini, and the absolute deviation were considered. A Monte Carlo study was conducted to study the behaviour of these measures of risk. Bootstrap methods were used by drawing random observations from real financial returns data, for the same purpose. Specifically, the equity indices from the following stock markets were used: Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Holland and Belgium. It is concluded that there is little reason to reject measures of risk other than the variance based on a view that they are too volatile. Indeed the evidence shows that whilst the standard deviation may be the appropriate measure of risk for high <b>volume</b> <b>markets</b> (Germany, UK and France), it is not the most reliable risk measurement (in terms of volatility) when considering lower <b>volume</b> <b>markets</b> (Italy, Holland and Belgium).
