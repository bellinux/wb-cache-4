In a <b>vacuum</b> <b>chuck,</b> air is pumped from a cavity behind the workpiece, and atmospheric pressure provides the holding force.

50|$|In photo nanoimprint {{lithography}} (P-NIL), a photo(UV) curable liquid resist {{is applied to}} the sample substrate and the mold is normally made of transparent material like fused silica or PDMS. After the mold and the substrate are pressed together, the resist is cured in UV light and becomes solid. After mold separation, a similar pattern transfer process can be used to transfer the pattern in resist onto the underneath material. The use of a UV-transparent mold is difficult in a vacuum, because a <b>vacuum</b> <b>chuck</b> to hold the mold would not be possible.|$|E

5000|$|A common {{method to}} {{increase}} adhesion of photoresist on the silicon wafer surface {{is to treat}} the wafer with Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). A new silicon wafer has a polar surface and has some adsorbed water on the surface. The wafer can undergo a dehydration bake to remove adsorbed water, and followed by the HMDS treatment {{also known as the}} priming stage. HMDS can be dispensed in liquid form onto the wafer using a syringe while the wafer is attached to a <b>vacuum</b> <b>chuck</b> in a spin coater. HMDS can also be applied in gas form in the process known as the vapor prime. The HMDS promotes good photoresist-to-wafer adhesion because it ensures the wafer surface is hydrophobic. After HMDS treatment the silicon surface oxide becomes silated, leaving a non-polar surface. The pristine silicon (100) face has a surface energy value of 56.9 mN/m, which is reduced to a value of 44.1 mN/m after HMDS treatment The molecular formula for hexamethyldisilazane is C6H19NSi2.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{discuss the}} {{lift-off}} of free-standing epitaxially grown silicon layers from the porous silicon (PSI) process, {{which is a}} kerfless wafering technology. The lift-off is a crucial step in the PSI cycle. A high-porosity layer serves as a mechanically weak layer for lift-off and consists of widely spaced silicon bridges with thicknesses of 40 - 100 nm. The low width leads to a 33 -fold stress enhancement in the bridges, making them break when a force is applied while the epitaxial layer and the substrate remain intact.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{statistical analysis}} of the factors controlling surface quality and form in ultra-precision grinding of polycrystalline lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramics has been conducted. The work focuses on practical grinding conditions and it includes {{an assessment of the}} interactions that exist between the method of material removal and the machine design. In the first phase of experimentation, defects including porosity and the fractural damage induced in the subsurface area were investigated.

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{utilization of}} materials {{is critical to}} certain device applications such as silicon for photovoltaics or diodes and gallium-gadolinium-garnet for memories. A variety of slicing techniques has been investigated to minimize wafer thickness and wafer kerf. This paper {{presents the results of}} analyses of ID wafering of rotated ingots based on predicted fracture behavior of the wafer as a result of forces during wafering and the properties of the device material. The analytical model indicated that the minimum wafer thickness is controlled by the depth of surface damage and the applied cantilever force. Both of these factors should be minimized. For silicon, a minimum thickness was found to be approximately 200 x 10 - 6 th m for conventional sizes of rotated ingot wafering. Fractures through the thickness of the wafer rather than through the center supporting column were found to limit the minimum wafer thickness.
